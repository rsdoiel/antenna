<h2 id="trump-says-dan-bongino-to-be-fbi-deputy-director">Trump says Dan
Bongino to be FBI deputy director</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said in a post on social media
Sunday that Dan Bongino, a conservative talk show host, will be deputy
director of the FBI.</p>
<p>Bongino will join Kash Patel, who was recently confirmed by the
Senate as director of the FBI. Trump said Bongino was named to the role
by Patel. The position does not require Senate confirmation.</p>
<p>“Great news for Law Enforcement and American Justice!” Trump posted
on his social media network, Truth Social, calling Bongino “a man of
incredible love and passion for our Country.”</p>
<p>Bongino was previously a New York City police officer, and a member
of the U.S. Secret Service. He most recently had been known as a
conservative radio host and podcaster.</p>
<p>Trump said in his post that Bongino is “prepared to give up” his
program as he steps into the new role. “The Dan Bongino Show” was most
recently the 56th-ranked podcast in the United States, according to
Spotify.</p>

id="conclave-triumphs-at-sag-awards-and-timothée-chalamet-wins-best-actor-upending-oscar-predictions">‘Conclave’
triumphs at SAG Awards and Timothée Chalamet wins best actor, upending
Oscar predictions</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The papal thriller “Conclave” won best ensemble and Timothée Chalamet
took best actor at the 31st Screen Actors Guild Awards on Sunday, a pair
of twists that added a few final wrinkles to an unusually unpredictable
awards season.</p>
<p>In winning the guild’s top award, Edward Berger’s Vatican-set drama
triumphed just as the Catholic Church was praying for the health of Pope
Francis, who remained in critical condition Sunday after an asthmatic
respiratory crisis. “Conclave” dramatizes the fictional election of a
new pope. Earlier in the evening onstage, Isabella Rossellini shared the
cast’s best wishes for Pope Francis.</p>
<p>All the momentum going into the SAG Awards was with Sean Baker’s
“Anora,” which had won with the producers, directors and writers guilds.
Now, with “Conclave” winning with the actors and at the BAFTAs, what
will nab best picture in a week’s time at the Academy Awards is, again,
anyone’s guess.</p>
<p>“Wow,” said “Conclave” star Ralph Fiennes taking the stage. “I’ve not
been elected to speak. I’ve been designated to speak on behalf of our
conclave, our ensemble.”</p>
<p>That wasn’t the only surprise in the ceremony held at the Shrine
Auditorium in Los Angeles and streamed lived by Netflix. Chalamet’s best
actor win upset “The Brutalist” star Adrien Brody and put the
29-year-old on course to possibly win his first Academy Award.</p>
<p>Chalamet looked visibly surprised when his name was announced at the
ceremony. But once he reached the staged, the “A Complete Unknown” star
spoke with composure and confidence.</p>
<p>“The truth is, this was 5 ½ years of my life,” said Chalamet. “I
poured everything I had into playing this incomparable artist, Mr. Bob
Dylan, a true American hero. It was the honor of a lifetime playing
him.”</p>
<p>He then added: “The truth is, I’m really in pursuit of greatness. I
know people don’t usually talk like that, but I want to be one of the
greats.”</p>
<p>The other Oscar favorites — Demi Moore, Zoe Saldaña and Kieran Culkin
— all won. The SAG Awards are closely watched as an Oscar preview. Their
picks don’t always align exactly with those of the film academy, but
they often nearly do.</p>
<p>The last three best ensemble winners — “Oppenheimer,” “Everything
Everywhere All at Once” and “CODA” — all went on to win best picture at
the Oscars. All but one of the SAG acting winners of the last three
years has also won the Oscar. (The sole exception was Lily Gladstone,
who won SAG’s award for female actor last year for “Killers of the
Flower Moon,” but the Oscar trophy went to Emma Stone for “Poor
Things”.)</p>
<p>Moore seemingly solidified her Oscar chances by following up her
Golden Globe win for her performance in “The Substance.” Moore, whose
campaign was boosted by her speech about being pigeonholed a “popcorn
actress,” has traded awards with “Anora” breakthrough Mikey Madison.</p>
<p>“What we believe is so much more powerful than what we think,” said
Moore. “The saying, ‘I’ll believe it when I see it’ — the reality is
when I believe it, I will see it.”</p>
<p>The SAG Awards unfolded against the backdrop of the aftermath of the
devastating wildfires that began in early January. Those fires forced
the guild to cancel its in-person nominations announcement and launch a
disaster relief fund for SAG-AFTRA members affected. Host Kristen Bell
introduced attending firefighters as “the most attractive tables” among
a sea of stars.</p>
<p>Jane Fonda, 87, given the guild’s Life Achievement Award, provided
the evening with its most passionately political moment. Fonda, a famed
activist, spoke indirectly about President Donald Trump’s
administration.</p>
<p>“We are in our documentary moment,” said Fonda. “This is it. And it’s
not a rehearsal.”</p>
<p>Fonda added that “woke just means you give a damn about other
people.”</p>
<p>“A whole lot of people are going to be hurt by what’s happening, by
what’s coming our way,” said Fonda. “We are going to need a big tent to
resist what’s coming at us.”</p>
<p>Jean Smart, who had advocated for canceling award shows because of
the wildfires, won best female actor in a comedy series for “Hacks.”
Smart didn’t attend, but participated in a pre-taped introduction as her
character, Deborah Vance.</p>
<p>Also not in attendance: Martin Short, though he upset Jeremy Allen
White to win best male actor in a comedy series for “Only Murders in the
Building.” The Hulu series also won for best comedy ensemble.</p>
<p>“Wait, we never win. This is so weird,” said Selena Gomez. “Marty and
Steve (Martin) aren’t here because, you know, they don’t really
care.”</p>
<p>Colin Farrell won his first SAG award, for his performance in “The
Penguin” and also became the first winner ever introduced, by Jamie Lee
Curtis, as “the man who gave me COVID at the Golden Globes.” Farrell
bounded to the stage and promptly responded, “Guilty as charged,” before
blaming Brendan Gleeson for giving it to him.</p>
<p>The night’s first televised award went to Culkin, who has won just
about every award in the category for “A Real Pain.” Gripping the SAG
trophy, he could quickly tell the difference.</p>
<p>“It is funny that the heaviest of all awards is given by actors,”
said Culkin, who characteristically riffed his way through a rambling
acceptance speech before swearing sincerity: “Believe it or not, this
actually means a lot to me.”</p>
<p>Netflix’s “Emilia Pérez,” which has seen its awards hopes largely
dashed by controversy over old tweets by lead actor Karla Sofia Gascón,
took home the award for best female supporting actor, for Oscar favorite
Saldaña.</p>
<p>For Netflix’s second time around streaming the awards, it inserted
ads sporadically, like a traditional broadcast. Last year, downtimes
were occupied by backstage interviews. Audio issues occasionally marred
the broadcast, including brief interruptions of Fonda’s speech.</p>
<p>After romps at the Emmys and Golden Globes, “Shōgun” kept up its
dominance. The FX series won best drama series ensemble, along with
acting awards for Hiroyuki Sanada, Anna Sawai and for best stunt
ensemble. The corresponding award for film went to the stunt performer
ode “The Fall Guy.”</p>

Harris receives prestigious Chairman’s prize at NAACP Image Awards</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Los Angeles — Former Vice President Kamala Harris stepped on the
NAACP Image Awards stage Saturday night with a sobering message, calling
the civil rights organization a pillar of the Black community and urging
people to stay resilient and hold onto their faith during the tenure of
President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>“While we have no illusions about what we are up against in this
chapter in our American story, this chapter will be written not simply
by whoever occupies the oval office nor by the wealthiest among us,”
Harris said after receiving the NAACP’s Chairman’s Award. “The American
story will be written by you. Written by us. By we the people.”</p>
<p>The 56th annual Image Awards was held at the Pasadena Civic
Auditorium in the Los Angeles area.</p>
<p>Harris, defeated by Trump in last year’s presidential election, was
the first woman and the first person of color to serve as vice
president. She had previously been a U.S. senator from California and
the state’s attorney general.</p>
<p>In her first major public appearance since leaving office, Harris did
not reference her election loss or Trump’s actions since entering the
Oval Office, although Trump mocked her earlier in the day at the
Conservative Political Action Conference.</p>
<p>Harris spoke about eternal vigilance, the price of liberty, staying
alert, seeking the truth and America’s future.</p>
<p>“Some see the flames on our horizons, the rising waters in our
cities, the shadows gathering over our democracy and ask ‘What do we do
now?’” Harris said. “But we know exactly what to do, because we have
done it before. And we will do it again. We use our power. We organize,
mobilize. We educate. We advocate. Our power has never come from having
an easy path.”</p>
<p>Other winners of the Chairman’s prize have included former President
Barack Obama, the late Rep. John Lewis and the late actor Ruby Dee.</p>
<p>NAACP Hall of Fame</p>
<p>Harris was honored during the ceremony along with the Wayans family.
The family was inducted into the NAACP Image Awards Hall of Fame in
recognition of pioneering contributions to film, TV, sketch and stand-up
comedy that have shaped Hollywood for decades.</p>
<p>Keenen Ivory Wayans, Damon Wayans Sr., Marlon Wayans, Shawn Wayans,
Kim Wayans and Damon Wayans Jr. each were recognized.</p>
<p>Marlon Wayans, whose guest appearance on Peacock’s “Bel-Air” was up
for an NAACP award, shared how Keenen Ivory Wayans sparked the family’s
rise.</p>
<p>“He raised us all like Jedis,” he said. “We wouldn’t be here if it
wasn’t for our big brother.”</p>
<p>Marlon Wayans joked that when his brother told their mom he was
leaving college for comedy, she said, “Boy, I’ve known you your whole
life, and you ain’t never said nothing funny. That’s the funniest thing
you’ve said.”</p>
<p>The crowd erupted in laughter, a fitting tribute to a family that has
kept audiences laughing for more than three decades.</p>
<p>The family has a long list of credits. Keenen Ivory Wayans created
the sketch comedy series “In Living Color” in 1990 and directed the 2000
slasher spoof “Scary Movie,” which was written by Marlon Wayans and
Shawn Wayans, who also wrote and starred in “White Chicks” in 2004.
Damon Wayan’s had a starring role in the 1995 comedy “Major Payne,” and
currently co-stars with son Damon Wayans Jr. in the CBS sitcom “Poppa’s
House,” which was nominated for an NAACP Award. The pair also were
nominated for their acting on the show.</p>
<p>Damon Wayans Jr. has acted in two of the most critically acclaimed
comedies in recent years: “Happy Endings” and “New Girl.” Kim Wayans, a
comedian, actor and director, also received praise for her work in the
2011 drama “Pariah.”</p>
<p>Entertainer of the year</p>
<p>Keke Palmer expressed her surprise after her name was called as
winner of the coveted entertainment of the year.</p>
<p>“Oh my gosh. Guys, I didn’t think I was going to win,” said Palmer,
who paid homage to fellow nominee Cynthia Erivo’s Oscar-nominated
performance in “Wicked.”</p>
<p>Palmer starred in the buddy comedy “One of Them Days,” which debuted
No. 1 at the box office last month. She also won an Emmy for her hosting
efforts on NBC’s “Password.”</p>
<p>“It’s such an amazing category to be in with all these people,”
Palmer said. “It’s a beautiful night. It’s Black History Month, y’all.
It’s so important we all come here together and celebrate one another
with one another.”</p>
<p>Other nominees included Kendrick Lamar, Kevin Hart and Shannon
Sharpe.</p>
<p>Awards recognize LA residents impacted by wildfires</p>
<p>Image Awards host Deon Cole honored residents of the nearby Altadena
neighborhood who were affected by January’s devastating Los Angeles-area
wildfires.</p>
<p>A video of the fire devastation played before actor Morris Chestnut
took the stage.</p>
<p>“Homes were lost, stores destroyed, countless lives shattered and
over two dozen souls gone forever,” said Chestnut, a Los Angeles native
who referenced impacted areas such as Altadena, the Pacific Palisades
and Malibu.</p>
<p>“But what was not lost is the spirit of our community,” said
Chestnut, who noted 22 Altadena residents attended the show on Saturday.
Many in the audience stood and applauded.</p>
<p>Cole shifted tone and brightened the mood with a comedic prayer for
Kanye West’s wife to find more clothes after her barely-there Grammys
look and for Shannon Sharpe to finally size up his T-shirts.</p>
<p>The opening act was a lead-up to the evening’s first award: Queen
Latifah as best actress in a drama series for her role in “The
Equalizer.”</p>
<p>Chappelle honored</p>
<p>Dave Chappelle was honored with the President’s Award for his
“thought-provoking humor.”</p>
<p>Accepting the award, Chappelle talked about the NAACP’s push against
negative portrayals of Black people in media and the importance of
representation.</p>
<p>“Every opportunity we get, we just keep chipping away at this monster
of a machine,” he said.</p>
<p>Past recipients of the President’s Award include Jay-Z, Lauryn Hill,
Usher, Rihanna and John Legend.</p>

governor asks Congress for nearly $40 billion for Los Angeles wildfire
relief</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Sacramento, California — California Gov. Gavin Newsom has asked
Congress to approve nearly $40 billion in aid to help the Los Angeles
area recover from January’s devastating wildfires, which he said could
become the costliest natural disaster in U.S. history.</p>
<p>Newsom sent a letter Friday asking for support from lawmakers
including House Speaker Mike Johnson and Rep. Tom Cole, the House
Appropriations Committee chair.</p>
<p>“Los Angeles is one of the most economically productive places on the
globe, but it can only rebound and flourish with support from the
federal government as it recovers from this unprecedented disaster,”
Newsom wrote.</p>
<p>The total economic losses from the firestorm have been estimated to
surpass $250 billion — with real estate losses from the Palisades and
Eaton fires predicted to potentially top $30 billion, according to a Los
Angeles Times analysis. More than 16,200 structures were destroyed as
flames ripped through Pacific Palisades, Malibu, Pasadena and
Altadena.</p>
<p>Newsom vowed that the funding would be used to rebuild homes,
infrastructure, businesses, schools, churches and health care
facilities, while supporting the needs of people affected by the
devastation.</p>
<p>“Make no mistake, Los Angeles will use this money wisely,” Newsom
wrote.</p>
<p>His largest request is for an additional $16.8 billion from the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, mostly intended for the rebuilding
of property and infrastructure, with $5 billion earmarked for debris
cleanup.</p>
<p>Newsom also asked for $9.9 billion from the Department of Housing and
Urban Development for grants to fire victims, homeowners, businesses and
renters, as well as $5.29 billion from the Small Business Administration
for homeowner and business loans.</p>
<p>Newsom thanked President Donald Trump for support for fast-tracking
debris removal. The letter did not mention recent threats by the Trump
administration that federal aid could come with strings attached.</p>
<p>“We are eternally grateful,” Newsom said.</p>
<p>Trump has been a frequent critic of Newsom and California’s water
policies. Ric Grenell, a Trump ally serving as his envoy for special
missions, said Friday that “there will be conditions” to any federal aid
for the state.</p>
<p>He said one of the possible conditions being discussed was defunding
the California Coastal Commission, which regulates coastal development
and protects public beach access. Trump has criticized the agency as
overly restrictive, bureaucratic and a hindrance to timely rebuilding
efforts.</p>

id="trump-administration-fires-2000-usaid-workers-puts-thousands-of-others-on-leave">Trump
administration fires 2,000 USAID workers, puts thousands of others on
leave</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The Trump administration said Sunday that it was placing
all but a fraction of staffers at the U.S. Agency for International
Development on leave worldwide and eliminating 2,000 U.S.-based staff
positions.</p>
<p>The move was the latest and one of the biggest steps yet toward what
President Donald Trump and cost-cutting ally Elon Musk say is their goal
of gutting the six-decade-old aid and development agency in a broader
campaign to slash the size of the federal government.</p>
<p>The move comes after a federal judge on Friday allowed the
administration to move forward with its plan to pull thousands of USAID
staffers off the job in the United States and around the world. U.S.
District Judge Carl Nichols rejected pleas in a lawsuit from employees
to keep temporarily blocking the government’s plan.</p>
<p>“As of 11:59 p.m. EST on Sunday, February 23, 2025, all USAID direct
hire personnel, with the exception of designated personnel responsible
for mission-critical functions, core leadership and/or specially
designated programs, will be placed on administrative leave globally,”
according to the notices sent to USAID workers that were viewed by The
Associated Press.</p>
<p>At the same time, the agency said it was beginning a reduction in
force that would eliminate 2,000 U.S.-based staffers. That means many of
the Washington-based staffers who are being placed on leave would soon
have their positions eliminated.</p>
<p>The Trump appointee running USAID, deputy administrator Pete Marocco,
has indicated he plans to keep about 600 mostly U.S.-based staffers on
the job in the meantime, in part to arrange travel for USAID staffers
and families abroad.</p>
<p>USAID and the State Department did not immediately respond to
messages seeking comment.</p>
<p>The move escalates a monthlong push to dismantle the agency, which
has included closing its headquarters in Washington and shutting down
thousands of aid and development programs worldwide following an effort
to freeze all foreign assistance. Trump and Musk contend that USAID’s
work is wasteful and furthers a liberal agenda.</p>
<p>Lawsuits by government workers’ unions, USAID contractors and others
say the administration lacks the constitutional authority to eliminate
an independent agency or congressionally funded programs without
lawmakers’ approval.</p>
<p>The Trump administration efforts upend decades of U.S. policy that
aid and development work overseas serves national security by
stabilizing regions and economies and building alliances, a critical
tool of U.S. “soft power” for winning influence abroad.</p>
<p>The notices of firings and leaves come on top of hundreds of USAID
contractors receiving no-name form letters of termination in the past
week, according to copies that AP viewed.</p>
<p>The blanket nature of the notification letters to USAID contractors,
excluding the names or positions of those receiving them, could make it
difficult for the dismissed workers to get unemployment benefits,
workers noted.</p>
<p>A different judge in a second lawsuit tied to USAID has temporarily
blocked the foreign funding freeze and said this past week that the
administration had kept withholding the aid despite his court order and
must at least temporarily restore the funding to programs worldwide.</p>

id="some-us-agencies-tell-workers-not-to-reply-to-musks-accomplishments-email">Some
US agencies tell workers not to reply to Musk’s ‘accomplishments
email’</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Multiple U.S. federal agencies told employees not to
respond immediately to a demand by President Donald Trump’s adviser Elon
Musk to list their accomplishments in the last week or be fired, as a
chaotic campaign to cull the bureaucracy pushes forward.</p>
<p>Trump administration-appointed officials at the FBI and State
Department sent their staff emails telling them not to respond outside
their chains of command, in a possible sign of tension between members
of the Republican administration and the world’s richest person in his
campaign to cut down the government’s 2.3 million-member civilian
workforce.</p>
<p>“The FBI, through the office of the director, is in charge of all our
review processes,” said FBI Director Kash Patel, a Trump appointee, in
an email to staff seen by Reuters.</p>
<p>Musk leads the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE),
which in the first weeks of Trump’s administration has laid off more
than 20,000 workers and offered buyouts to another 75,000, across wide
swaths of the government from the Defense Department — long a top
Republican priority — to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, where
all staff have been ordered to halt work.</p>
<p>The frantic pace has led the federal government in some cases to rush
to rehire workers who perform critical functions like securing the
nation’s nuclear arsenal and trying to fight the worsening bird flu
outbreak, which has caused egg prices to spike higher.</p>
<p>While there is bipartisan agreement that the U.S. government, which
carries $36 trillion in debt, would benefit from reform, Musk’s
tumultuous approach has drawn widespread criticism, including from
voters in some Republican areas.</p>
<p>Federal workers Saturday evening received an email instructing them
to detail the work they did during the previous week by 11:59 p.m. ET on
Monday (0459 GMT Tuesday), shortly after Musk posted on his X social
media site that failing to respond would be taken as a resignation.</p>
<p>The subject of the email read, “What did you do last week?” and came
from a human resources address in the Office of Personnel Management,
but did not include Musk’s threat of termination.</p>
<p>Workers at the departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Education
and Commerce, as well as at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,
the National Institutes of Health and the Internal Revenue Service also
were told not to respond, pending further guidance, according to sources
and emails reviewed by Reuters.</p>
<p>“To be clear — this is irregular, unexpected, and warrants further
validation,” a senior executive at the National Centers for
Environmental Information, an agency that manages environmental data and
is part of the Commerce Department, wrote.</p>
<p>Some officials welcomed the move. Ed Martin, Trump’s nominee for U.S.
Attorney in Washington, D.C., who is serving in an interim capacity,
praised Musk and DOGE in an email response.</p>
<p>But other offices within the Justice Department, including the
executive office that supports all U.S. attorneys and the department’s
civil division, told employees not to reply, pending additional
information.</p>
<p>Employees at the Drug Enforcement Administration, part of the Justice
Department, were told to respond, according to an email seen by
Reuters.</p>
<p>Union questions Musk’s authority</p>
<p>The largest federal workers’ union, the American Federation of
Government Employees, wrote on X on Sunday that it did not believe Musk
had the authority to fire employees who did not respond and would
formally request that OPM rescind the message.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the union advised members to ask their supervisors
directly whether to reply and to follow their guidance.</p>
<p>The email left some employees even more frustrated and worried after
weeks of uncertainty about their futures.</p>
<p>“I really wonder when someone is going to say enough,” one IRS
employee told Reuters.</p>
<p>Media offices at the Commerce, Justice, Education and Treasury
departments, as well as at the FDIC and NIH, did not immediately respond
to requests for comment. An FBI spokesperson declined to comment, and a
State Department spokesperson referred questions to the White House.</p>
<p>Musk on X on Sunday called the email “a very basic pulse check.”</p>
<p>Senator John Curtis, a Republican from Utah, said he supports the
Trump administration’s efforts to reduce government spending, but that
Musk should take a more humane approach.</p>
<p>“If I could say one thing to Elon Musk, it’s please put a dose of
compassion in this,” Curtis said on CBS News’ “Face the Nation.”</p>
<p>“These are real people. These are real lives. These are mortgages.
It’s a false narrative to say we have to cut, and you have to be cruel
to do it as well.”</p>
<p>Some federal judiciary employees, including judges, also received the
Saturday email from OPM, even though the court system is not part of the
executive branch, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts
confirmed.</p>
<p>The judiciary advised employees that no action should be taken in
response to the message, according to an email reviewed by Reuters.</p>
<p>In some cases, employees were left unsure how to respond even if they
chose to do so.</p>
<p>Some lawyers, for instance, expressed concern that their work is
confidential.</p>
<p>Workers at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau also received the
email, according to people with knowledge of the matter, even though
they were all ordered to cease working since early this month, leaving
them with little to do.</p>

defends Trump’s firings of Pentagon leaders, says more may be to
come</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth insists President Donald
Trump ’s abrupt firing of the nation’s senior military officer amid a
wave of dismissals at the Pentagon wasn’t unusual and he suggested more
firings could come.</p>
<p>“Nothing about this is unprecedented,” Hegseth told “Fox News Sunday”
about Air Force Gen. CQ Brown Jr. being removed Friday night as chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. “The president deserves to pick his key
national security advisory team.”</p>
<p>Hegseth said “there are lots of presidents who made changes” citing
former commanders in chief, including Franklin D. Roosevelt, George H.W.
Bush and Barack Obama. Obama, Hegseth said, “fired or dismissed
hundreds” of military officials.</p>
<p>Months into his first term, Obama removed Army Gen. David McKiernan
from being commander of the U.S. forces in Afghanistan. However, Trump,
while running for his second term, vowed to eradicate “woke” ideologies
from the military and to swiftly dismiss many top leaders.</p>
<p>Hegseth and Trump have made no secret about focusing on pushing aside
military officers who have supported diversity, equity and inclusion in
the ranks. The administration says the move will better fortify a lethal
fighting force.</p>
<p>Brown was just the second Black general to serve as chairman. His 16
months in the post were consumed with the war in Ukraine and the
expanded conflict in the Middle East. Trump in 2020 nominated Brown as
Air Force’s chief of staff.</p>
<p>Trump wants to replace Brown with Air Force Lt. Gen. Dan “Razin”
Caine, who retired in December. It is unclear what recalling Caine to
active-duty service will require. The position requires Caine to be
confirmed by the Senate.</p>
<p>Hegseth said Friday’s dismissals affected six three- and four-star
generals and were “a reflection of the president wanting the right
people around him to execute the national security approach we want to
take.”</p>
<p>He called Brown “honorable” but said he is “not the right man for the
moment,” without citing specific deficiencies. After the 2020 murder of
George Floyd, Brown in a video spoke of his experience as a Black pilot,
apparently making him fodder for the Trump administration’s wars against
inclusion initiatives in the military.</p>
<p>Of Caine, Hegseth said that Trump “respects leaders who untie the
hands of war fighters in a very dangerous world.”</p>
<p>Retired Gen. George Casey called the firings “extremely
destabilizing.” Casey, who was Republican President George W. Bush’s
commander of the U.S. and multinational forces in Iraq from 2004 to
2007, also noted that the Trump administration can change Pentagon
policy without changing personnel, but added, that what happened is
“within the president’s prerogative.”</p>
<p>“That’s his prerogative,” Casey told ABC’s “This Week.” “He is the
commander in chief of the armed forces.”</p>
<p>Still, Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the ranking Democrat on the
Senate Armed Services Committee told ABC that the firings were
“completely unjustified” and that “apparently, what Trump and Hegseth
are trying to do is to politicize the Department of Defense.”</p>
<p>Hegseth was also asked on Fox News about officials potentially
compiling lists of more defense officials they plan to fire. He said
there was no list but suggested that more dismissals could indeed be
coming.</p>
<p>“We have a very keen eye towards military leadership and their
willingness to follow lawful order,” Hegseth said. “Joe Biden gave
lawful orders. A lot of them are really bad,” he said, adding that
things like COVID vaccine mandates “eroded” the military
ideologically</p>
<p>“President Trump has given another set of lawful orders and they will
be followed,” Hegseth said. “If they’re not followed then those officers
will find the door.”</p>

Airlines flight from New York to Delhi lands safely in Rome after
security concern</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Rome, Italy — An American Airlines flight from New York to New Delhi,
India, landed safely in Rome on Sunday afternoon after it was diverted
due to a security concern , which later proved to be “non-credible,” the
airline said. </p>
<p>American Airlines said Flight 292 “was inspected by law enforcement”
after landing at Leonardo da Vinci International Airport and “cleared to
re-depart.” </p>
<p>It didn’t clarify the cause of the security concern, but added an
inspection was required by protocol before the flight could land in New
Delhi. </p>
<p>“The flight will stay in Rome overnight to allow for required crew
rest before continuing to Delhi as soon as possible tomorrow,” the
airline said. </p>
<p>An Associated Press reporter filmed two fighter jets flying over the
airport shortly before the unscheduled landing. Fire trucks were visible
on the landing strip on one side of the plane after it landed. </p>
<p>The airport continued to operate normally, a spokesman with Rome’s
airport said.</p>

America’ dives in 2nd weekend, ‘The Monkey’ boosts Neon’s successes</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — “Captain America: Brave New World” soared on opening
weekend but crashed down in its second go-around with audiences. </p>
<p>“Brave New World,” the latest sign that the Marvel machine isn’t
quite what it used to be, remained No. 1 at the box office in its second
frame with $28.2 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates
Sunday. But after a debut of $100 million over four days and $88 million
over three days, that meant a steep drop of 68%. </p>
<p>While blockbusters often see significant slides in their second
weekends, only two previous MCU titles have fallen off so fast: 2023’s
“The Marvels,” which fell 78%, and 2023’s “Ant-Man and the Wasp:
Quantumania,” which dropped 70%. </p>
<p>The Anthony Mackie-led “Captain America” installment has been slammed
by critics, and audiences also have graded it poorly, with a “B-”
CinemaScore. “Brave New World,” which fans had hoped would right the
Marvel ship, has been largely met as another example of a once
impenetrable brand struggling to recapture its pre- “Avengers: Endgame”
aura of invincibility. </p>
<p>Still, “Brave New World” has quickly grossed $289.4 million
worldwide, with international sales nearly reaching $150 million. And
with few big-budget offerings arriving in theaters in the coming weeks,
it will have scant competition through much of March. </p>
<p>The biggest new release of the weekend was Oz Perkins’ “The Monkey,”
the director’s follow-up to his 2024 horror hit, “Longlegs.” Adapted
from a Stephen King short story, “The Monkey” opened with $14.2 million
for Neon, the second-best debut for the indie distributor. The best?
“Longlegs,” which launched with $22.4 million. </p>
<p>Neon had much to celebrate over the weekend. Its top awards
contender, “Anora,” by Sean Baker, continues to gather momentum into
next Sunday’s Academy Awards. The best-picture favorite added wins at
the Independent Spirit Awards on Saturday. </p>
<p>Perkins, Neon and Blumhouse, which partnered in the release of “The
Monkey,” have found a productive low-budget collaboration, with more on
the way. Even if “The Monkey” doesn’t reach the heights of “Longlegs”
($126.9 million globally), Perkins and Neon return with “Keeper” this
October. </p>
<p>“The Monkey,” starring Tatiana Maslany and Theo James, revolves
around an old monkey toy found in an attic. Reviews have been good (77%
fresh on Rotten Tomatoes), though audiences were less impressed, giving
it a C+ CinemaScore. Horror films, though, typically grade low. </p>
<p>As it did with “Longlegs,” Neon leaned into cryptic promotion for
“The Monkey,” along with some macabre marketing. A funeral premiere was
held at Los Angeles’ Immanuel Presbyterian Church, and fan screenings
took place at the Hollywood Cemetery. The film, produced by James Wan,
cost $10 million to make. </p>
<p>Lionsgate’s “The Unbreakable Boy” opened with a paltry $2.5 million
in 1,687 theaters. The Christian-themed Jon Gunn-directed film starring
Zachary Levi and Meghann Fahy, is about parents who learn their son is
autistic and has brittle bone disease. </p>
<p>“Paddington in Peru,” the third installment of the marmalade-mad
bear, fell to third place in its second weekend. It grossed $6.5 million
in 3,890 locations, bringing its two-week total to $25.2 million.
“Paddington in Peru” has been most popular overseas, where its collected
$150 million thus far. </p>
<p>“Ne Zha 2,” the animated Chinese juggernaut, took in $3.1 million
from 800 theaters in its second weekend. In China, the sequel has
grossed $1.7 billion this month, setting numerous box-office records.
Those totals put “Ne Zha 2” past “Inside Out 2” ($1.66 billion) as the
highest grossing animated film ever. </p>
<p>Top 10 movies by domestic box office </p>
<p>With final domestic figures releasing Monday, this list factors in
the estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and
Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. </p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>“Captain America: Brave New World,” $28.2 million. </p></li>

id="washington-kyiv-headed-toward-deal-for-ukrainian-critical-minerals-rights">Washington,
Kyiv headed toward deal for Ukrainian ‘critical minerals’ rights</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The United States and Ukraine said Sunday they are heading toward an
agreement for Kyiv to give Washington a large share of its rare earth
mineral rights as compensation for the billions of dollars in munitions
the U.S. sent to Ukraine to defend itself from Russia’s full-scale
war.</p>
<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told a news conference in
Kyiv that Ukraine and the U.S. are “making progress” in reaching a deal.
He said a draft of the pact calls for Ukraine to pay the U.S. $2 for
each dollar in aid the U.S. has sent to Kyiv to fight Russia’s invasion,
although details of the would-be agreement have not been disclosed.</p>
<p>Zelenskyy called for security guarantees for Ukraine as part of any
deal and said he wants better financial terms. “I don’t want something
that 10 generations of Ukrainians will have to pay back,” he said.</p>
<p>The war hits the three-year mark on Monday.</p>
<p>Watch related report by Veronica Balderas Iglesias:</p>
<p>The U.S. has been Ukraine’s biggest benefactor, sending $128 billion
in military and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, according to
Germany’s Kiel Institute for the World Economy. The U.S. share is just
ahead of the combined $124 billion figure for the 27-nation European
Union.</p>
<p>U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff told CNN’s “State of the Union” that
he expects Zelenskyy will sign the minerals deal this week.</p>
<p>Zelenskyy at first rejected the U.S. demand for half of Ukraine’s
rare earth mineral supplies, which are used in the production of
technology products. Witkoff signaled in the CNN interview that the deal
will now be completed although he did not spell out details of the
agreement.</p>
<p>Witkoff said that European countries made their contributions to
Ukraine’s war efforts after reaching agreement with Kyiv to eventually
be paid back, but the U.S. had no such understanding.</p>
<p>Witkoff said such U.S. support for Ukraine with no repayment terms
made “no sense” to President Donald Trump, a long-time New York real
estate deal maker before entering politics in 2015.</p>
<p>Zelenskyy said, “I had an agreement with [former U.S. President Joe]
Biden and American Congress, I am grateful to the Congress, to the both
parties. And it was support by providing grants. Grant is not a loan.
And we don’t have to return the loan here. Maybe someone does not like
it and thinks that it’s unjust. Maybe. I don’t know. But here is what
this deal was about. It was grant. Therefore, it’s not about the figure.
We simply don’t see it as a loan.”</p>
<p>Trump, who last week called Zelenskyy a “dictator” and accused him of
starting the war even though Russia invaded Ukraine, has demanded the
repayments and blamed his predecessor, Biden, for not securing some form
of compensation guarantee.</p>
<p>Zelenskyy said Sunday he wants Trump to “understand” his position and
come through with concrete security guarantees to help Kyiv defend
itself against the Russian invasion.</p>
<p>“I want very much from Trump understanding of each other,” Zelenskyy
said at his news conference, adding: “Security guarantees from Trump are
much needed.”</p>
<p>Zelenskyy said he was willing to give up his presidency if it meant
peace in Ukraine, quipping that he could exchange his departure for
Ukraine’s entry into NATO, which Russia is adamantly opposed to.</p>
<p>“If [it means] peace for Ukraine, if you really need me to leave my
post, I am ready,” Zelenskyy said. “I can exchange this for NATO
[membership], if that condition is there, immediately.”</p>
<p>The top U.S. and Russian diplomats, U.S. Secretary of State Marco
Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, met in Saudi Arabia
without either Ukrainian or European officials last week to lay the
groundwork for peace talks to end the war. Zelenskyy complained about
Ukraine being excluded from the talks, but Trump said he could have
negotiated with Russia beforehand to talk Moscow out of invading.</p>
<p>“I’ve had very good talks with Putin, and I’ve had not such good
talks with Ukraine,” Trump told U.S. state governors at the White
House.</p>
<p>“They don’t have any cards, but they play it tough,” Trump said of
Ukraine.</p>
<p>Russian state television said in recent days that Trump’s view of the
Russia-Ukraine conflict is “in total alignment with the way we see
things.”</p>
<p>Witkoff said the war “wouldn’t have had to happen” if Ukraine hadn’t
been pushing at the time for membership in NATO. Kyiv is still pressing
to join the 32-nation pact, but Washington says it is unrealistic for
that to happen as part of a negotiated peace settlement to end the
war.</p>
<p>Witkoff said that eventually “you’ll see concessions signed by both
sides” in a peace deal.</p>
<p>Russia now controls about one-fifth of the internationally recognized
Ukrainian territory, with Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov saying
Sunday Moscow has no intention of yielding any of the land back to the
Kyiv government.</p>
<p>“The people decided to join Russia a long time ago,” he said,
referring to Moscow-staged votes in eastern Ukraine held amid the
three-year offensive that were assailed as bogus by Kyiv, the West and
international monitors.</p>
<p>“No one will ever sell off these territories,” Peskov said. “That’s
the most important thing.”</p>
<p>A Trump call with Putin two weeks ago set the stage for the
Rubio-Lavrov talks in Saudi Arabia.  </p>
<p>“This is a dialogue between two extraordinary presidents,” Peskov
told state TV.  </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Zelenskyy said Russia launched 267 overnight drone attacks
on Ukraine, which he condemned as “aerial terror.” Ukrainian officials
reported damage in five regions of the country.  </p>
<p>Zelenskyy said that in the past week, Russia has targeted Ukraine
with nearly 1,150 attack drones, more than 1,400 guided aerial bombs and
35 missiles of various types. </p>

<h2 id="kremlin-hails-putin-trump-dialogue-as-promising">Kremlin hails
Putin-Trump dialogue as promising</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Moscow — The Kremlin on Sunday hailed dialogue between U.S. President
Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin — two “extraordinary”
presidents — as “promising,” and vowed it would “never” give up
territory seized in eastern Ukraine.</p>
<p>Trump broke with Western policy earlier this month by phoning Putin
to discuss how to end the conflict in Ukraine — a call hailed by Moscow
as ending three years of isolation for the Kremlin leader since he
launched his full-scale offensive in February 2022.</p>
<p>Top Russian and U.S. officials then met in Saudi Arabia last week to
discuss a “restoration” of ties and start a discussion on a possible
ceasefire — all without the involvement of Kyiv or Europe.</p>
<p>“This is a dialogue between two extraordinary presidents,” Kremlin
spokesman Dmitry Peskov told state TV on Sunday.</p>
<p>“That’s promising,” he added.</p>
<p>“It is important that nothing prevents us from realizing the
political will of the two heads of state.”</p>
<p>Trump’s overtures to Moscow have triggered alarm in Kyiv and across
Europe.</p>
<p>But it is unclear whether his moves will be able to bring Moscow and
Kyiv closer to a truce.</p>
<p>Peskov on Sunday ruled out any territorial concessions as part of a
settlement.</p>
<p>“The people decided to join Russia a long time ago,” he said,
referring to Moscow-staged votes in eastern Ukraine held amid the
offensive that were slammed as bogus by Kyiv, the West and international
monitors.</p>
<p>“No one will ever sell off these territories. That’s the most
important thing.”</p>
<p>‘God willed it’</p>
<p>Putin said God and fate had entrusted him and his army with “the
mission” to defend Russia.</p>
<p>“Fate willed it so, God willed it so, if I may say so. A mission as
difficult as it is honorable — defending Russia — has been placed on our
and your shoulders together,” he told servicemen who have fought in
Ukraine.</p>
<p>Russia was on Sunday marking Defender of the Fatherland Day — a
holiday hailing soldiers and veterans — a day before the three-year
anniversary of the start of its full-scale offensive.</p>
<p>“Today, at the risk of their lives and with courage, they are
resolutely defending their homeland, national interests and Russia’s
future,” Putin said in a video released by the Kremlin.</p>
<p>Moscow’s army had overnight launched a record 267 attack drones at
Ukraine, Kyiv’s air force said.</p>
<p>Among them, 138 were intercepted by air defense and 119 were
“lost.”</p>
<p>Ukraine did not say what happened to the remaining 10 but a separate
armed forces statement on Telegram said several regions, Kyiv included,
had been “hit.”</p>
<p>AFP journalists in the Ukrainian capital heard air defense systems in
operation throughout the night.</p>
<p>‘Inappropriate remarks’</p>
<p>Amid his outreach to Moscow, Trump has also verbally attacked
Ukraine’s leader, Volodymyr Zelenskyy falsely claiming Kyiv started the
war and that Zelenskyy was hugely unpopular at home.</p>
<p>The bitter war of words has threatened to undermine Western support
for Kyiv at a critical juncture in the conflict.</p>
<p>Zelenskyy on Sunday called for the Western coalition that has been
helping Kyiv fend off the Russian offensive for the last three years to
hold strong.</p>
<p>“We must do our best to achieve a lasting and just peace for Ukraine.
This is possible with the unity of all partners: we need the strength of
the whole of Europe, the strength of America, the strength of all those
who want lasting peace,” Zelenskyy said on Telegram.</p>
<p>Moscow has reveled in the spat between Trump and Zelenskyy.</p>
<p>“Zelenskyy makes inappropriate remarks addressed to the head of
state. He does it repeatedly,” Peskov said Sunday.</p>
<p>“No president would tolerate that kind of treatment. So his [Trump’s]
reaction is completely quite understandable.”</p>
<p>Scrambling to respond to Trump’s dramatic policy reversal, French
President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer will
travel to Washington next week to make the case for supporting
Ukraine.</p>

id="new-fbi-director-patel-will-also-be-named-acting-head-of-firearms-agency-official-says">New
FBI Director Patel will also be named acting head of firearms agency,
official says</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — New FBI Director Kash Patel is expected to be named the
acting head of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives,
a Justice Department official said Saturday.</p>
<p>Patel could be sworn in next week, the official said, putting Patel
in charge of two of the Justice Department’s largest agencies in an
unusual arrangement that raises questions about the future of the bureau
that has long drawn the ire of conservatives.</p>
<p>The Justice Department official spoke on the condition of anonymity
to discuss the move before it’s announced publicly. White House
officials didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Saturday
evening.</p>
<p>Patel was sworn in Friday as FBI director after winning Senate
approval despite Democrats’ concerns about the steadfast Trump ally’s
plans to radically overhaul the FBI.</p>
<p>ATF is a separate agency with about 5,500 employees and is
responsible for enforcing the nation’s laws around firearms, explosives
and arson. Among other things, it’s in charge of licensing federal
firearms dealers, tracing guns used in crimes and analyzing intelligence
in shooting investigations.</p>
<p>The move was first reported Saturday by ABC News.</p>
<p>The news comes days after Attorney General Pam Bondi fired the ATF’s
top lawyer. Bondi said in a Fox News interview Friday that she fired
chief counsel Pamela Hicks because the agency was “targeting gun
owners.” Hicks, who spent more than 20 years as a Justice Department
lawyer, said in a social media post that being ATF chief counsel was the
“highest honor” of her career.</p>
<p>Conservatives have long railed against ATF over its role in
regulating firearms and have suggested shuttering the agency. Under the
Biden administration, the ATF advanced new regulations aimed at cracking
down on ghost guns and requiring thousands more firearms dealers to run
background checks on buyers at gun shows or other places outside
brick-and-mortar stores.</p>
<p>In an executive order earlier this month, President Donald Trump
directed the attorney general to review all actions taken by the Biden
administration around firearms “to assess any ongoing infringements of
the Second Amendment rights of our citizens.”</p>
<p>Gun safety groups have raised alarm about putting Patel in charge of
the FBI, with gun control group Brady calling him a “known gun rights
extremist.” Gun Owners of America, a gun rights group, called his
confirmation as FBI director “a major victory for gun owners and
constitutional rights advocates nationwide.”</p>
<p>The last confirmed ATF director was Steve Dettelbach, a former
federal prosecutor, who led the agency from July 2022 until last month.
He was the first confirmed director since 2015 as both Republican and
Democratic administrations failed to get nominees through the
politically fraught process.</p>

threatens to deport Afghans if US relocation timeline isn’t met</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD — Pakistan has warned that thousands of Afghan nationals
awaiting relocation and resettlement in the United States will be
deported to Afghanistan if their cases are rejected or not processed on
time.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar issued the warning during a television
interview aired Saturday, noting that the U.S. has promised to relocate
the Afghan community in question from Pakistan “tentatively around
September this year.” His office in Islamabad released the interview
excerpts.</p>
<p>“If any refugee who was undertaken to be taken by another country
after due process —no matter the timeline — if it doesn’t happen and the
country refuses, then for us, that will be an illegal immigrant in
Pakistan, and we might be forced to send such refugee back to [their]
original country, which is Afghanistan,” Dar told Turkey’s TRT national
broadcaster.</p>
<p>However, the chief Pakistani diplomat expressed Islamabad’s
willingness to resolve the issue with Washington, stating that his
government is “examining the situation and will negotiate
[accordingly].”</p>
<p>Last month, U.S. President Donald Trump halted refugee applications
and travel plans until further notice to ensure that refugee entry into
the United States aligns with its national interests.</p>
<p>The decision has stranded around 45,000 Afghans prepared to fly out
of Afghanistan and at least 15,000 qualified refugees currently in
Pakistan, according to #AfghanEvac, a coalition that assists Afghans
with their relocation and resettlement in the U.S.</p>
<p>These individuals were part of Afghan families who fled their country
following the Taliban insurgents’ retaking of power in 2021, primarily
seeking refuge from potential retribution because of their affiliations
with the U.S. and NATO forces during their nearly two-decade-long
presence in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>While about 80,000 of these Afghans have since been relocated from
Pakistan, officials in Islamabad assert that around 40,000 remain in a
state of limbo including around 15,000 in Pakistan destined for the
United States.</p>
<p>Since launching a crackdown on undocumented foreign migrants in
September 2023, Pakistan has forcibly repatriated more than 825,000
undocumented Afghan refugees to their home country, according to the
United Nations.</p>
<p>The government has recently intensified its crackdown, targeting both
documented and undocumented Afghan refugees.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif ordered authorities last month to
remove all Afghans from Islamabad and the adjoining city of Rawalpindi
by Feb. 28 before arranging for deporting them to Afghanistan along with
others subsequently. The targeted population encompasses over 2.5
million Afghans nationwide, comprising lawful refugees, documented
economic migrants, and those without legal authorization to remain in
Pakistan.</p>
<p>Sharif’s directive stipulates March 31 as the deadline for the United
States and other countries to process the cases of Afghans awaiting
resettlements, thereby preventing their deportation.</p>

Starmer to meet Trump, offer ideas for Ukraine security guarantees</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LONDON/PARIS — French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime
Minister Keir Starmer will travel to Washington next week amid alarm in
Europe over U.S. President Donald Trump’s hardening stance toward
Ukraine and overtures to Moscow on the three-year conflict.</p>
<p>The leaders of Europe’s two nuclear powers, who will be traveling
separately, are expected to try to persuade Trump not to rush into a
ceasefire deal with Vladimir Putin at any cost, keep Europe involved and
discuss military guarantees to Ukraine.</p>
<p>Macron, who is trying to capitalize on a relationship with Trump
built during their first presidential terms, has said agreeing to a bad
deal that would amount to a capitulation of Ukraine would signal
weakness to the United States’ foes, including China and Iran.</p>
<p>“I will tell him: deep down you cannot be weak in the face of
President (Putin). It’s not you, it’s not what you’re made of and it’s
not in your interests,” he said in an hourlong question and answer
session on social media ahead of Monday’s visit to the White House.</p>
<p>The visits come amid a rift between Trump and Ukrainian President
Volodymyr Zelenskyy, whom Trump described as a “dictator.” That has
alarmed Kyiv’s European allies, already reeling from a more aggressive
U.S. posture on trade, diplomacy and even domestic European
politics.</p>
<p>Philip Golub, a professor in international relations at the American
University in Paris, said Trump’s rapid-fire moves in his first weeks in
office, as well as the rhetoric from other U.S. officials, had been a
major shock for the Europeans.</p>
<p>“They could not have expected that somehow within the United States
would emerge this ultra-nationalist coalition of forces that would
actually challenge Europe’s voice in world affairs in such a stark and
strong way,” he told Reuters.</p>
<p>He said Macron believed he had a “historic role to play” in going to
Washington to ensure Europe can weigh in on the ultimate negotiations on
Ukraine. “Whether he can actually achieve something, however, in this
visit is an entirely different matter,” he added.</p>
<p>Starmer, who has also warned the end of the war cannot be a
“temporary pause before Putin attacks again,” will be in Washington on
Thursday.</p>
<p>Speaking on a Fox News podcast on Friday, Trump said Macron and
Starmer had not “done anything” to end the war. “No meetings with
Russia!” he said, although he described Macron as “a friend of mine” and
Starmer as “a very nice guy.”</p>
<p>However, the two countries are keen to show Trump they are ready to
take on a bigger burden for European security.</p>
<p>Britain and France are firming up ideas with allies for military
guarantees for Ukraine and their two leaders will seek to persuade Trump
to provide U.S. assurances in any post ceasefire deal, Western officials
said.</p>
<p>Their respective militaries began initial planning last summer for
the post-war scenario, but the discussions accelerated in November after
Trump secured the U.S. presidency, a French military official and two
diplomats said.</p>
<p>They have also been supported in putting together an array of options
by countries like Denmark and the Baltic states as Europeans discuss
what they would be ready to do should there be an accord and
peacekeepers required, officials said.</p>
<p>While both Britain and France have ruled out sending troops to
Ukraine immediately, the plans, still in concept stage, center around
providing air, maritime, land and cyber support that would aim to deter
Russia from launching any future attacks, Western officials said.</p>
<p>Air and sea assets could be based in Poland or Romania, restoring
safe international air space and ensuring the Black Sea remained safe
for international shipping, the official said.</p>
<p>Part of the British and French talks center around the possibility of
sending European peacekeepers. While U.S. boots on the ground may not be
necessary, deterrence in the form of U.S. medium-range missiles and
ultimately nuclear weapons will remain crucial.</p>
<p>The options being discussed would center not on providing troops for
the frontline or the 2,000-kilometer border which would remain secured
by Ukrainian forces, but further to the West, three European diplomats
and the military official said.</p>
<p>Those troops could be tasked with protecting key Ukrainian
infrastructure such as ports or nuclear facilities to reassure the
Ukrainian population. However, Russia has made it clear it would oppose
a European presence in Ukraine.</p>
<p>A French military official said there was little sense in talking
numbers at this stage because it would depend on what was finally
agreed, what international mandate was given and whether non-European
troops would also be involved.</p>
<p>“It’s not about the numbers of troops in Ukraine. It’s the ability to
mobilize and the ability to arrange everything into a package of
interoperability units,” the French official said.</p>
<p>A Western official said that even 30,000 troops could be on the “high
side.”</p>

id="musk-orders-us-federal-workers-to-describe-what-they-did-at-work-last-week-or-get-fired">Musk
orders US federal workers to describe what they did at work last week or
get fired</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Elon Musk, the billionaire head of the Trump
administration’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), threatened
Saturday to fire any federal worker who fails to explain what work they
have accomplished during the previous week. </p>
<p>The threat, issued in a post on the social media site X, was made
just hours after President Donald Trump posted on his own social media
network Truth Social that DOGE should get more aggressive in its
attempts to downsize and reshape the federal workforce. </p>
<p>“All federal employees will shortly receive an email requesting to
understand what they got done last week,” Musk posted on X. “Failure to
respond will be taken as a resignation.” </p>
<p>As of Saturday evening, emails were sent to employees at federal
agencies including the Securities and Exchange Commission, National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention and others with the subject line, “What did you do last
week?” </p>
<p>The email, seen by Reuters, asks employees to reply to the email they
have received with five bullet points summarizing “what you accomplished
at work last week” and copy their managers. </p>
<p>The email sent from a human resources address gives employees until
11:59 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on Monday to respond. </p>
<p>It is unclear what legal basis Musk has to terminate federal workers
if they fail to respond to his request. </p>
<p>Workers at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau also received the
email Saturday, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
However, most agency staff had been ordered not to perform any tasks
since early this month, creating a conundrum. The agency is also under a
temporary court order not to resume mass firings pending the outcome of
legal proceedings. </p>
<p>A spokesperson for DOGE did not immediately respond to a request for
comment. </p>
<p>The AFGE, the union representing federal employees, said in a
statement it will challenge any “unlawful terminations.”  </p>
<p>“Once again, Elon Musk and the Trump administration have shown their
utter disdain for federal employees and the critical services they
provide to the American people,” said AFGE National President Everett
Kelley.  </p>
<p>The Trump administration’s fast-paced and controversial process to
reduce government spending by shrinking the federal workforce led by
Musk and his young aides at the cost-cutting DOGE has led to haphazard
firings that resulted in numerous mistakes and forced several agencies
to quickly rehire vital employees, such as those working on nuclear
safety, defense and power generation. </p>
<p>The first wave of job cuts has targeted workers who are easier to
fire, such as employees on the job for less than two years or those who
have started new roles within an agency. </p>
<p>The indiscriminate firings have led to DOGE terminating people whose
jobs are not funded by taxpayers and have begun to anger people across
the country who are concerned about a loss of services as well as the
impact of federal job losses on local economies. </p>
<p>Trump has repeatedly talked about Musk as the functional leader of
DOGE, which is not a Cabinet-level department, but the White House said
in a court filing earlier this month that Musk had no authority over
DOGE and was not an employee of the program.</p>

id="officer-killed-after-gunman-takes-hostages-at-pennsylvania-hospital">Officer
killed after gunman takes hostages at Pennsylvania hospital</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>YORK, PENNSYLVANIA — A man armed with a pistol and carrying zip ties
entered a Pennsylvania hospital’s intensive care unit Saturday and took
staff members hostage before he was killed by police in a shootout that
also left an officer dead, authorities said.</p>
<p>Three workers at UPMC Memorial Hospital, including a doctor, a nurse
and a custodian, and two other officers were shot and wounded in the
attack, York County District Attorney Tim Barker said. A fourth staffer
was injured in a fall.</p>
<p>Gunfire erupted after officers went to engage the shooter, whom
Barker identified as Diogenes Archangel-Ortiz, 49. He said
Archangel-Ortiz was holding at gunpoint a female staff member who had
her hands bound with zip ties when police opened fire.</p>
<p>“This is a huge loss to our community,” Barker said at a news
conference following the shooting. “It is absolutely clear, and beyond
any and all doubt, that the officers were justified in taking their
action using deadly force.”</p>
<p>Barker added that while the investigation is in its early stages, it
appears Archangel-Ortiz had previous contact with the hospital’s ICU
earlier in the week for “a medical purpose involving another individual”
and he intentionally targeted the workers there.</p>
<p>No one answered the door Saturday at an address in York believed to
be that of Archangel-Ortiz.</p>
<p>The officer who died was identified as Andrew Duarte of the West York
Borough Police Department.</p>
<p>“We all have broken hearts and are grieving at his loss,” West York
Borough Manager Shawn Mauck told The Associated Press.</p>
<p>Duarte was a law enforcement veteran who joined the department in
2022 after five years with the Denver Police Department, according to
his LinkedIn profile. He described receiving a “hero award” in 2021 from
Mothers Against Drunk Driving for his work in impaired driving
enforcement for the state of Colorado.</p>
<p>“I have a type A personality and like to succeed in all that I do,”
his LinkedIn profile said.</p>
<p>Duarte also worked as a patrol officer in Denver, was highly regarded
for his work and was close friends with other officers, the department
there said in a statement.</p>
<p>At a makeshift memorial on the front steps of the West York Borough
Police Department, Linda Shields dropped off roses Saturday and dabbed
tears as she thought of her son, a police officer in Maryland.</p>
<p>“He was so young,” Shields said of Duarte. “It makes no sense at
all.”</p>
<p>Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro called the attack on police and health
care workers “the act of a coward.”</p>
<p>“Let it not be lost on anyone the act of extraordinary bravery and
courage by the health care workers here, by the law enforcement
professionals … who ran toward danger to keep people safe,” Shapiro
said.</p>
<p>UPMC Memorial is a five-story, 104-bed hospital that opened in 2019
in York, a city of about 40,000 people known for its creation of York
Peppermint Patties in 1940.</p>
<p>The shooting is part of a wave of gun violence in recent years that
has swept through U.S. hospitals and medical centers, which have
struggled to adapt to the growing threats. Such attacks have helped make
health care one of the nation’s most violent fields, with workers
suffering more nonfatal injuries from workplace violence than workers in
any other profession, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention.</p>
<p>In 2023, a shooter killed a security guard in the lobby of New
Hampshire’s state psychiatric hospital before being fatally shot by a
state trooper. In 2022, a man killed two workers at a Dallas hospital
while there to watch his child’s birth. In May of that year, a man
opened fire in a medical center waiting room in Atlanta, killing one
woman and wounding four. And just one month later, a gunman killed his
surgeon and three other people at a Tulsa, Oklahoma, medical office
because he blamed the doctor for his continuing pain after an
operation.</p>

id="trump-revels-in-mass-federal-firings-jeers-at-biden-before-cpac-crowd">Trump
revels in mass federal firings, jeers at Biden before CPAC crowd</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>OXON HILL, MARYLAND — President Donald Trump said Saturday that
“nobody has ever seen anything” like his administration’s sweeping
effort to fire thousands of federal employees and shrink the size of
government. </p>
<p>Addressing an adoring crowd at the Conservative Political Action
Conference in suburban Washington, Trump said, “We’re going to forge a
new and lasting political majority that will drive American politics for
generations to come.” </p>
<p>The president has spent the opening weeks of his administration
arguing that voters in November gave him a mandate to overhaul
government while cracking down on the U.S.-Mexico border and to extend
tax cuts that were the signature policy of his first
administration. </p>
<p>In a speech that lasted more than an hour, Trump predicted that the
Republican Party would defy history, which has shown that a president’s
party typically struggles during midterm congressional elections. Of
Republicans, he said, “I don’t think we’ve been at this level, maybe
ever.” </p>
<p>“Nobody’s ever seen anything like this, and nobody’s ever seen four
weeks like we had,” Trump said, likening his new administration’s
opening month to being on a roll through the first four holes of a round
of golf, which he said gave him confidence for the fifth. </p>
<p>Trump has empowered billionaire Elon Musk to help carry out the
firings; Musk vowed Saturday that more might be coming. </p>
<p>“Consistent with President <span class="citation"
data-cites="realDonaldTrump">@realDonaldTrump</span>’s instructions, all
federal employees will shortly receive an email requesting to understand
what they got done last week,” Musk posted on X, which he owns. “Failure
to respond will be taken as a resignation.” </p>
<p>Trump also repeatedly said Saturday that he’d carry out harder-line
immigration policies. But those efforts have largely been overshadowed
by his administration’s mass federal firings. He announced that one
agency that had been significantly reduced, the U.S. Agency for
International Development, would have its Washington office taken over
by Customs and Border Protection officials. </p>
<p>“The agency’s name has been removed from its former building,” he
said. </p>
<p>The president also repeated his previous promises that his
administration will scrutinize the country’s gold depository at Fort
Knox. </p>
<p>“Would anybody like to join us?” he said to cheers from the crowd.
“We want to see if the gold is still there.” </p>
<p>‘Donald, don’t get angry’ </p>
<p>But Trump also devoted large parts of his address to last year’s
presidential race, jeering at former President Joe Biden and
mispronouncing the first name of former Vice President Kamala Harris —
his Election Day opponent. </p>
<p>He also mentioned Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat who ran for
president in 2020. </p>
<p>The president said immigration and border policy under Biden made him
angry. </p>
<p>“I couldn’t stand it,” Trump said, before cautioning himself,
“Donald, don’t get angry.” He went on to use an expletive to describe
what he thinks of Biden’s handling of border security, despite noting
that evangelical conservatives have urged him not to use foul
language. </p>
<p>Trump had kinder words for Chinese President Xi Jinping, saying “I
happen to like” him, while adding, “we’ve been treated very unfairly by
China and many other countries.” </p>
<p>President meets with world leaders</p>
<p>On the sidelines of the conference, Trump met with conservative
Polish President Andrzej Duda amid rising tensions in Europe over
Russia’s war in Ukraine. After he took the stage, Trump saluted Duda and
Argentine President Javier Milei, who separately addressed the
conference. </p>
<p>Trump called Duda “a fantastic man and a great friend of mine.” He
noted that Milei was “a MAGA guy, too, Make Argentina Great Again.” </p>
<p>Duda is a populist who has enjoyed a close relationship with Trump in
years past. Poland is a longtime ally of Ukraine. Trump upended recent
U.S. policy by dispatching top foreign policy advisers to Saudi Arabia
for direct talks with Russian officials that were aimed at ending
fighting in Ukraine. </p>
<p>Those meetings did not include Ukrainian or European officials, which
has alarmed U.S. allies. After his face-to-face with Duda, Trump is
meeting Monday at the White House with French President Emmanuel Macron
and Thursday with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. </p>
<p>Trump also has begun a public back and forth with Ukrainian President
Volodymyr Zelenskyy, whom the U.S. president called a “dictator” while
falsely suggesting that Ukraine started the war — though on Friday he
acknowledged that Russia attacked its neighbor. </p>
<p>Trump said during his speech, “I’m dealing with President Zelenskyy.
I’m dealing with President Putin” and added of fighting in Ukraine, “It
affects Europe. It doesn’t really affect us.” </p>
<p>About ending the war in Ukraine, Trump said Saturday, “I think we’re
pretty close to a deal, and we better be close to a deal.”  </p>
<p>Later, the president and first lady Melania Trump were hosting an
evening reception and dinner at the White House for the National
Governors Association, which was holding their own weekend meetings in
Washington.</p>

<h2 id="us-uzbekistan-reaffirm-commitment-to-central-asia-security">US,
Uzbekistan reaffirm commitment to Central Asia security</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — As the Trump administration begins to engage with
Central Asia, Uzbekistan has expressed eagerness to expand its strategic
partnership, highlighting what it calls its “enhanced” political
dialogue on bilateral and regional issues and security cooperation,
including its “solid connection” with the Mississippi National
Guard.</p>
<p>The U.S. recently got back its seven Black Hawk helicopters from
Uzbekistan that Afghan military pilots had flown there in 2021 while
fleeing the Taliban.</p>
<p>This transfer and other bilateral exchanges within the last month
have underscored Tashkent’s role as Washington’s key partner in Central
Asia, according to U.S. officials. However, analysts see the military
relationship as largely transactional and shaped by geopolitical
complexities and regional tensions.</p>
<p>Talk between diplomats</p>
<p>In a phone conversation on February 21 with Uzbek Foreign Minister
Bakhtiyor Saidov, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio reiterated U.S.
support for the country’s independence, sovereignty, and territorial
integrity, according to State Department’s spokesperson Tammy Bruce.</p>
<p>They discussed a joint effort through the C5+1 diplomatic platform,
launched nearly a decade ago between Washington and five Central Asian
republics. The Trump administration is interested in using this platform
to support “a more peaceful and prosperous Central Asia.”</p>
<p>Saidov described his talk with Rubio as “candid and productive,”
aiming to expand the “strategic partnership between our nations in all
spheres without an exception. Building strong bridges between business
communities, increasing trade volume in both directions, ensuring
prosperous development in Central Asia.”</p>
<p>Cooperation with Pentagon, ties with Mississippi</p>
<p>Uzbek Ambassador Furqat Sidikov says his country’s forces “have stood
shoulder-to-shoulder with the Mississippi National Guard in the best
ways,” citing joint exercises and Pentagon-sponsored professional
exchanges.</p>
<p>“We are a reliable partner of the United States in the region,”
Sidikov said at a January 31 embassy reception, pointing to defense
reforms and improvements in the Uzbek military’s equipment.</p>
<p>Mississippi National Guard Adjutant General Major General Bobby Ginn
emphasized at the event that since 2012, the partnership has facilitated
more than 170 engagements between U.S. and Uzbek soldiers, strengthening
disaster response and readiness.</p>
<p>“Uzbekistan’s commitment to regional stability and contributions to
counterterrorism efforts and border security” demonstrate the power of
its armed forces, Ginn said.</p>
<p>Davis Florick, the Pentagon’s acting principal director for Eurasia,
also attending the reception, thanked Tashkent for “storing” U.S.
aircraft and diligently working with America toward the mutually
beneficial solution. He confirmed that the seven Black Hawks were part
of a fleet from Afghanistan that, according to multiple sources,
included 24 helicopters, among them Mi-17s and UH-60s, and 22 fixed-wing
aircraft, most of which were transferred to Uzbekistan last year.</p>
<p>Another high-level Pentagon official, Rear Admiral Erin Osborne,
speaking at the same gathering, praised Uzbekistan as a “critical ally”
that offered its airspace and an air base during the initial years of
the U.S. military campaign in Afghanistan. The republic was also part of
Pentagon’s Northern Distribution Network, delivering nonmilitary goods
to the international coalition fighting in the neighboring country.</p>
<p>Osborne said that mutual trust and understanding were reflected in
“capacity-building initiatives and the sharing of intelligence to
counter common threats.”</p>
<p>The U.S., she added, is committed to working with Uzbekistan “to
ensure its stability and sovereignty, as well as the stability and
sovereignty of the entire Central Asian region.”</p>
<p>The Taliban and the Afghanistan factor</p>
<p>Even though the transfer of the Black Hawks back to the U.S. was
disclosed at the embassy event, Uzbek officials have been tight-lipped
about this collaboration to avoid any tension with the Taliban, which
has condemned the handovers as an infringement on Afghanistan’s
sovereignty. The Taliban’s Defense Ministry issued a statement
denouncing the transfer as “unacceptable” and demanding the return of
the aircraft.</p>
<p>Eighteen U.S. aircraft also ended up in Tajikistan in 2021, but
Washington and Dushanbe have yet to settle the matter.</p>
<p>During a visit to the region in June 2022, U.S. Central Command
commander General Michael Kurilla said the aircraft would not be
returned to Afghanistan “because they do not belong to the Taliban … Our
hope is to be able to hand over some or all of the aircraft to the Tajik
government.”</p>
<p>Washington analysts view Uzbekistan as the most active U.S. military
partner in the region, comparing it with the activities other republics
in Central Asia have with their state partners, specifically Kazakhstan
with Arizona, Tajikistan with Virginia, and Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan
with Montana.</p>
<p>Still, they characterize Tashkent-Washington security relationship as
more transactional than strategic.</p>
<p>“The Uzbeks want training and equipment. What do we want from them? A
reliable partner in the region,” said a former U.S. official with
extensive experience in Central Asia, speaking to VOA on the condition
of anonymity for professional reasons.</p>
<p>The U.S. has trained Uzbek pilots to operate and maintain the
transferred aircraft, but continued congressional funding — amounting to
several million dollars — is crucial for sustained cooperation.</p>
<p>“There will be questions from Congress, of course,” the former
official said. “The primary justification so far has been that these
assets would help counter extremists from Afghanistan.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, experts in Tashkent support Uzbekistan’s cautious approach
to the Taliban. As officials have said, Uzbekistan will engage with
whoever governs Afghanistan. While it does not officially recognize the
Taliban, the administration of President Shavkat Mirziyoyev has forged
stable diplomatic relations with Kabul, holds significant investment and
business agreements with the country, and provides humanitarian aid to
the Afghan people. Last summer, Uzbekistan opened a free economic zone
in the city of Termez on the border with Afghanistan, inviting neighbors
to foster entrepreneurial cooperation.</p>
<p>U.S. interests and Central Asian security</p>
<p>The U.S. maintains military cooperation agreements with each Central
Asian republic, with plans reviewed annually and subject to funding
approval.</p>
<p>Despite intelligence-sharing efforts, there is no U.S.-Uzbekistan
overflight agreement. Tashkent does not allow its territory to be used
for strikes on neighboring soil, even against terrorist targets.</p>
<p>“The Trump administration may question this,” said the former U.S.
official. “It complicates the case for cooperation with Uzbekistan
because they’re centrally located, yet we must fly around them. It’s
hard to justify what we’re getting in return.”</p>
<p>For years, the U.S. has also supported regional border security
initiatives.</p>
<p>“That’s the big program,” the former U.S. official said, but added:
“How many terrorists have we stopped? How many have been disrupted,
killed, or captured? Do we have those hard numbers? We are still in the
nascent stages of setting up the program.”</p>

urges Musk to be more aggressive in bid to shrink US government</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday urged
billionaire Elon Musk to be more aggressive in his efforts to shrink the
federal government despite the uproar over layoffs and deep spending
cuts.</p>
<p>“Elon is doing a great job, but I would like to see him get more
aggressive,” Trump posted all in uppercase letters on his Truth Social
platform. “Remember, we have a country to save, but ultimately, to make
greater than ever before. MAGA!”</p>
<p>Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE — an entity
created by Trump — has swept across federal government agencies, firing
tens of thousands of federal government workers, from scientists to park
rangers, mostly those on probation.</p>

id="trump-putin-summit-preparations-are-underway-russia-says">Trump-Putin
summit preparations are underway, Russia says</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Preparations are underway for a face-to-face meeting between U.S.
President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, Russia’s
deputy foreign minister said Saturday, marking a clear departure from
Western efforts to isolate Moscow over its war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Speaking to Russian state media, Sergei Ryabkov said a possible
Putin-Trump summit could involve broad talks on global issues, not just
the war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>“The question is about starting to move toward normalizing relations
between our countries, finding ways to resolve the most acute and
potentially very, very dangerous situations, of which there are many,
Ukraine among them,” he said.</p>
<p>But he said that efforts to organize such a meeting are at an early
stage, and that making it happen will require “the most intensive
preparatory work.”</p>
<p>Ryabkov said that U.S. and Russian envoys could meet “within the next
two weeks” to pave the way for further talks between senior
officials.</p>
<p>Russian and U.S. representatives meeting in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday
agreed to start working toward ending the war in Ukraine and improving
their diplomatic and economic ties, an extraordinary about-face in U.S.
foreign policy under Trump. Senior U.S. officials have suggested Ukraine
will have to give up its goals of joining NATO and retaining the 20% of
its territory seized by Russia.</p>
<p>After the meeting, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told the AP
that the two sides agreed broadly to pursue three goals: to restore
staffing at their respective embassies in Washington and Moscow; to
create a high-level team to support Ukraine peace talks; and to explore
closer relations and economic cooperation.</p>
<p>He stressed, however, that the talks — which were attended by his
Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, and other senior Russian and U.S.
officials — marked the beginning of a conversation, and that more work
needs to be done. Lavrov, for his part, hailed the meeting as “very
useful.”</p>
<p>No Ukrainian officials were present at the meeting, which came as the
beleaguered country is slowly but steadily losing ground against
more-numerous Russian troops, three years after Moscow launched an
all-out invasion of its smaller neighbor.</p>
<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country would not
accept any outcome from the talks since Kyiv didn’t take part, and he
postponed his own trip to Saudi Arabia scheduled for last Wednesday.
European allies also have expressed concerns they are being
sidelined.</p>
<p>Trump appears to soften Kyiv criticism</p>
<p>Trump on Friday appeared to walk back his earlier comments that
falsely blamed Kyiv for starting the war, but he insisted that Zelenskyy
and former U.S. President Joe Biden should have done more to come to
terms with Putin.</p>
<p>“Russia attacked, but they shouldn’t have let him attack,” he said
during a radio interview with Brian Kilmeade of Fox News, referring to
the Russian leader.</p>
<p>Russia’s army crossed the border on Feb. 24, 2022, in an all-out
invasion that Putin sought to justify by falsely saying it was needed to
protect Russian-speaking civilians in eastern Ukraine and prevent the
country from joining NATO.</p>
<p>Later on Friday at the Oval Office, Trump told reporters that the war
“doesn’t affect the United States very much. It’s on the other side of
the ocean. It does affect Europe.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Marches in London to support Ukraine</p>
<p>Thousands of people waving blue-and-yellow Ukrainian flags marched to
the Russian Embassy in London on Saturday, demanding Ukraine be given
more support and a place at the table in talks to end the three-year
war.</p>
<p>Organizers called for the withdrawal of Russian troops and increased
military aid to strengthen Kyiv’s hand.</p>
<p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is scheduled to visit Washington
next week for talks focused on Ukraine. He has emphasized that no
decisions about the country’s future can be made without Kyiv’s
involvement.</p>
<p>Starmer spoke with Zelenskyy on Saturday and reiterated “the U.K.’s
ironclad support for Ukraine and commitment to securing a just and
enduring peace to bring an end to Russia’s illegal war,” the prime
minister’s office said.</p>

id="amid-rising-worldwide-populism-us-conservative-conference-goes-global">Amid
rising worldwide populism, US conservative conference goes global</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — This week, thousands of conservative politicians,
activists and influencers convened outside Washington for the
Conservative Political Action Conference, the premier annual gathering
of the American right.</p>
<p>The four-day event, hosted by the American Conservative Union since
1974, features U.S. President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance,
among other high-profile speakers from around the world.</p>
<p>Dubbed the “Woodstock for conservatives,” CPAC was once the go-to
event for conservative Republicans and presidential hopefuls, with its
presidential straw poll serving as a barometer of grassroots support.
However, Trump’s political rise in recent years has transformed it into
a platform for populism.</p>
<p>Driven by the rise of populist movements globally, the conference has
ventured overseas in the past decade. It launched its first
international conference in Japan in 2017, expanded to Australia, Brazil
and South Korea in 2019, then added Hungary, Mexico and Israel in 2022.
Argentina joined the fold last year following the election of populist
President Javier Milei.</p>
<p>The international conferences, CPAC says, serve to “unite
conservatives from all over the world, strengthen the movement, and
challenge globalism.” They are also used for public outreach,
recruitment and mobilization, according to a recent paper on CPAC by
Grant A. Silverman, a research assistant at George Washington University
in Washington.</p>
<p>CPAC’s growing international outreach mirrors a recent surge in
far-right populism worldwide. Last year’s foreign speakers included
Presidents Nayib Bukele of El Salvador and Javier Milei of Argentina, as
well as Prime Minister Victor Orbán of Hungary.</p>
<p>Here’s a look at some of the foreign speakers for this year’s CPAC
and what they’re saying:</p>
<p>Javier Milei, Argentine president</p>
<p>Milei, wielding a chain saw, electrified the CPAC crowd Thursday when
he shared the stage with billionaire Elon Musk and presented Musk,
Trump’s cost-cutting czar, with his signature campaign prop.</p>
<p>“This is the chain saw of bureaucracy,” Musk, the CEO of Tesla and
SpaceX, shouted, waving the tool.</p>
<p>As head of the Department of Government Efficiency, Musk, who made
his first CPAC appearance, is spearheading the Trump administration’s
massive governmentwide cost-cutting efforts.</p>
<p>This marks Milei’s third CPAC appearance. The self-styled
“anarcho-capitalist” campaigned in 2023 on shrinking Argentina’s
government, often brandishing a chain saw at rallies.</p>
<p>At last year’s Washington conference, he vowed to eliminate
unnecessary government agencies, declaring, “We will not surrender until
we make Argentina great again!”</p>
<p>Speaking at CPAC Argentina in December, Milei declared that the “new
winds of freedom are sweeping through the world” and called on allies to
fight against “lefties.”</p>
<p>“We must stand together, establishing channels of cooperation
throughout the world,” he told the crowd.</p>
<p>Jair Bolsonaro, former president of Brazil</p>
<p>Brazil’s former right-wing president is a CPAC regular. After
Bolsonaro lost a reelection bid in 2022, his supporters stormed federal
government buildings in an alleged attempt to seize power. Banned from
seeking office until 2030, Bolsonaro faces charges of plotting a
coup.</p>
<p>His son, Eduardo Bolsonaro, organizes CPAC Brazil. At last year’s
conference in Balneario Camboriu, the elder Bolsonaro joined Milei and
other right-wing politicians from Latin America to hail conservatism’s
global rise and expressed hope for Trump’s return to office.</p>
<p>For his part, Milei used the platform to denounce socialism, saying
it restricts liberties and breeds corruption.</p>
<p>Robert Fico, prime minister of Slovakia</p>
<p>Robert Fico makes his CPAC debut this year. Though he leads a
left-wing populist party, he has drawn controversy for his attacks on
journalists, immigrants and LGBTQ+ people.</p>
<p>In October, he called journalists “bloody bastards” and threatened
new media restrictions. An opponent of same-sex marriage, he has called
adoption by gay couples a “perversion.”</p>
<p>During the Ukraine conflict, Fico has opposed European sanctions on
Moscow and echoed Moscow’s messaging, drawing comparisons to Hungary’s
pro-Kremlin prime minister.</p>
<p>In May, he survived an assassination attempt by a gunman opposed to
his stance against military assistance to Ukraine.</p>
<p>Mateusz Morawiecki, former Polish prime minister</p>
<p>After speaking at CPAC Hungary last year, Morawiecki makes his first
U.S. appearance this year. He served as prime minister from 2017 to 2023
and is now a leading figure in the opposition Law and Justice Party.</p>
<p>Despite his party’s strong support for Ukraine, Morawiecki maintains
close ties with Hungary’s Orban and Spain’s Santiago Abascal, leader of
the conservative Vox political party. Abascal is an invited speaker at
CPAC.</p>
<p>Immigration is a unifying issue for Europe’s right-wing populists. At
last year’s Hungary conference, Morawiecki called Orban his friend and
credited his tough response to Europe’s 2015 migration crisis with
preventing “chaos” in Europe.</p>
<p>Liz Truss, former British prime minister</p>
<p>The former Conservative Party leader and prime minister made her
second CPAC appearance in a row Wednesday. Calling Britain a “failed
state” ruled by a socialist government, she called for a Trump-style
MAGA movement to save it.</p>
<p>“We want a Trump revolution in Britain,” she said to applause,
praising Trump’s second presidency as “the golden age of America.”</p>
<p>Blaming Britain’s decline on unelected bureaucrats, she urged the
dismantlement of the “deep state,” a favorite theme among conference
attendees.</p>
<p>“We want Elon and his nerd army of muskrats examining the British
deep state,” Truss said.</p>
<p>Truss served just 49 days as prime minister and lost her Parliament
seat last year.</p>

CPAC remarks, White House national security adviser pledges crackdown on
Mexican cartels</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Politicians, media personalities and conservative activists gathered
outside Washington on Friday for the second day of a conference
featuring a range of political allies of President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Speakers at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC)
heralded the Trump administration’s first month in office, with dozens
of executive orders that have proposed sweeping changes to a wide range
of government policies and positions on international issues.</p>
<p>Mike Waltz, the president’s national security adviser, told the CPAC
audience Friday that the Trump administration’s efforts to end the
Ukraine war are certain to include U.S. investments in Ukraine’s mineral
assets as part of a plan to recoup some funding for Ukraine’s
defense.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy rejected a
proposal that would grant American companies 50% ownership of Ukraine’s
rare earth minerals, but Waltz on Friday said the Ukrainian leader “is
going to sign” a revised U.S. offer.</p>
<p>Waltz also said the Trump administration plans to “unleash holy hell”
on drug cartels. On Wednesday, the State Department designated several
Mexican drug cartels as terrorist groups.</p>
<p>Journalist-turned-politician Kari Lake, whom Trump said in December
he would like to see lead Voice of America, spoke about what she sees as
the president’s wins in his first month in office, and her views on
legacy media.</p>
<p>“Watching what President Trump has accomplished and done in one month
is so incredible,” Lake said, referring to actions by the Elon Musk-led
Department of Government Efficiency and the State Department to search
for corruption and curtail spending, including by ending foreign aid
funding.</p>
<p>A former TV journalist in Arizona for nearly 30 years, Lake spoke of
how she quit journalism because of what she felt was disinformation
about the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>“We’re still surrounded by too many fake journalists out there,” Lake
said, adding that she believes the “purpose of the mainstream media is
no longer to inform us, it’s to manipulate us.”</p>
<p>She criticized Associated Press reporting on government officials and
independent bodies who validated the results of the 2020 election,
saying, “They still pretend the 2020 election was the most secure
election in all of history.”</p>
<p>Lake also said that she is honored that Trump named her to lead VOA,
and said she will focus the news agency on producing “accurate and
honest reporting.”</p>
<p>“VOA has been telling America’s story to the world for 83 years this
Monday. Sometimes the coverage has been incredible and sometimes it’s
been pitiful,” Lake said. “We are fighting an information war, and
there’s no better weapon than the truth, and I believe VOA could be that
weapon.”</p>
<p>Among those who have called for the network to be cut is Musk.</p>
<p>“We won’t become Trump TV,” she said, “but it sure as hell will not
be ‘TDS TV.’ You can find all the Trump Derangement Syndrome that you
want over on CNN, MSNBC, PBS, ‘60 Minutes,’ The Washington Post and The
New York Times.”</p>
<p>Trump is expected to address the CPAC gathering on Saturday.</p>

<p>date: 2025-02-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Uncertainty looms over U.S.-Ukraine relations as Ukraine enters the
fourth year of war with Russia. Recent shifts in Washington’s rhetoric
have raised fears that Ukraine could be pressured into an unfavorable
peace deal – or be left to confront Russia without U.S. support. While
most Ukrainians are now in favor of peace talks, many insist any
settlement be on Ukraine’s terms. Myroslava Gongadze has the story from
Warsaw, Poland, with reporting from Anna Chernikova in Kyiv,

<p>date: 2025-02-22, from: Market Place, Make me Smart</p>
<p>
The Supreme Court on Friday chose not to intervene in a case involving
President Donald Trump’s firing of an independent agency head. As the
case is passed back to the lower courts, it tees up a legal battle that
will test the president’s power to dismiss officials. We’ll get into
what this could all mean for the Federal Reserve. And, U.S. national
parks are being hit by the administration’s purge of the federal
workforce. Plus, we’ll weigh in on Birkenstocks, prebiotic sodas and the
“White Lotus effect” during a round of Half Full/Half Empty!

<h2 id="trump-fires-chairman-of-joint-chiefs-of-staff">Trump fires
chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump abruptly fired Air Force General
CQ Brown as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on Friday, sidelining
a history-making fighter pilot and respected officer as part of a
campaign to rid the military of leaders who support diversity and equity
in the ranks.</p>
<p>The ouster of Brown, only the second Black general to serve as
chairman, is sure to send shock waves through the Pentagon. His 16
months in the job had been consumed with the war in Ukraine and the
expanded conflict in the Middle East.</p>
<p>“I want to thank General Charles ‘CQ’ Brown for his over 40 years of
service to our country, including as our current Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff. He is a fine gentleman and an outstanding leader, and I
wish a great future for him and his family,” Trump posted on social
media.</p>
<p>Trump said he was nominating Air Force Lieutenant General Dan “Razin”
Caine to be the next chairman.</p>
<p>Trump acted despite support for Brown among key members of Congress
and a seemingly friendly meeting with him in mid-December, when the two
were seated next to each other for a time at the Army-Navy football
game. Brown had been meeting regularly with Defense Secretary Pete
Hegseth, who took over the top Pentagon job just four weeks ago.</p>

<h2 id="ap-sues-white-house-officials-over-denial-of-access">AP sues
White House officials over denial of access</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Associated Press filed a lawsuit against three White
House officials on Friday after the news agency was barred from some of
U.S. President Donald Trump’s events.</p>
<p>The AP, in the suit filed in a federal court in Washington, said the
denial of access violates the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution,
which guarantees freedom of speech and of the press.</p>
<p>The White House began blocking AP journalists from the Oval Office 10
days ago over the news agency’s refusal to follow Trump’s executive
order renaming the Gulf of Mexico the “Gulf of America.”</p>
<p>The ban on AP reporters was later extended to Air Force One.</p>
<p>The news group said it was bringing the suit against three Trump
administration officials to “vindicate its rights to the editorial
independence guaranteed by the United States Constitution.”</p>
<p>“The White House has ordered The Associated Press to use certain
words in its coverage or else face an indefinite denial of access,” the
AP said.</p>
<p>“The press and all people in the United States have the right to
choose their own words and not be retaliated against by the government,”
it said.</p>
<p>“The Constitution does not allow the government to control speech.
Allowing such government control and retaliation to stand is a threat to
every American’s freedom.”</p>
<p>The suit names as defendants White House chief of staff Susan Wiles
and deputy chief of staff Taylor Budowich, as well as White House press
secretary Karoline Leavitt.</p>
<p>“We’ll see them in court,” Leavitt said during an appearance Friday
at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington.</p>
<p>“We feel we are in the right. We are going to ensure that truth and
accuracy is present at that White House every single day,” she said.</p>
<p>In its style guide, the AP noted that the Gulf of Mexico has “carried
that name for more than 400 years.”</p>
<p>“The Associated Press will refer to it by its original name while
acknowledging the new name Trump has chosen,” it said.</p>
<p>“As a global news agency that disseminates news around the world, the
AP must ensure that place names and geography are easily recognizable to
all audiences.”</p>
<p>Trump called the AP a “radical left organization” on Thursday and
said the new Gulf of America name is “something that we feel strongly
about.”</p>
<p>His leveraging of press access underscores the Republican president’s
long-standing animosity toward traditional news outlets, which he
accuses of bias against him.</p>
<p>The White House Correspondents’ Association has called AP’s exclusion
from Trump events outrageous.</p>
<p>The 180-year-old news agency has long been a pillar of U.S.
journalism and provides news to print, TV and radio outlets across the
United States and around the world.</p>
<p>Voice of America subscribes to The Associated Press, which provides
video, audio and written content.</p>

Angeles mayor ousts fire chief for response to deadly fires</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — Six weeks after the most destructive wildfire in city
history, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass ousted the city’s fire chief
Friday amid a public rift over preparations for a potential fire and
finger-pointing between the chief and City Hall over responsibility for
the devastation.</p>
<p>Bass said in a statement that she is removing Chief Kristin Crowley
immediately.</p>
<p>“Bringing new leadership to the Fire Department is what our city
needs,” Bass said in a statement.</p>
<p>“We know that 1,000 firefighters that could have been on duty on the
morning the fires broke out were instead sent home on Chief Crowley’s
watch,” Bass disclosed. She added that the chief refused a request to
prepare an “after-action report” on the fires, which she called a
necessary step in the investigation.</p>
<p>The Palisades Fire began during heavy winds Jan. 7, destroying or
damaging nearly 8,000 homes, businesses and other structures and killing
at least 12 people in the Los Angeles neighborhood.</p>
<p>Another wind-whipped fire started the same day in suburban Altadena,
a community to the east, killing at least 17 people and destroying or
damaging more than 10,000 homes and other buildings.</p>
<p>Bass has been facing criticism for being in Africa as part of a
presidential delegation on the day the fires started, even though
weather reports had warned of dangerous fire conditions in the days
before she left.</p>
<p>In televised interviews this week, Bass acknowledged she made a
mistake by leaving the city. But she inferred she wasn’t aware of the
looming danger when she flew around the globe to attend the inauguration
of Ghanaian President John Dramani Mahama. She faulted Crowley for
failing to alert her to the potentially explosive fire conditions.</p>
<p>Crowley has publicly criticized the city for budget cuts that she
said made it harder for firefighters to do their jobs.</p>
<p>Crowley was named fire chief in 2022 by Bass’ predecessor at a time
when the department was in turmoil over allegations of rampant
harassment, hazing and discrimination. She worked for the city fire
department for more than 25 years and held nearly every role, including
fire marshal, engineer and battalion chief.</p>

<h2 id="nearly-100-cases-of-measles-reported-in-texas-new-mexico">Nearly
100 cases of measles reported in Texas, New Mexico</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The measles outbreak in rural West Texas has grown to 90 cases across
seven counties, the state health department posted online Friday, and 16
people are hospitalized. </p>
<p>In neighboring eastern New Mexico, the measles case count is up to
nine, though state public health officials said Thursday there’s still
no evidence this outbreak is connected to the one in Texas. </p>
<p>The West Texas cases are concentrated in eight counties in West
Texas.  </p>
<p>Texas state health department data shows that most of the cases are
among people younger than 18. Twenty-six cases are in kids younger than
4 and 51 are in kids 5-17 years old. Ten adults have measles, and three
cases are pending an age determination. The Ector County Health
Department told the Odessa American its case was in a child too young to
be vaccinated. </p>
<p>State health officials have said this outbreak is Texas’ largest in
nearly 30 years. Health department spokeswoman Lara Anton said last week
that cases have been concentrated in a “close-knit, undervaccinated”
Mennonite community — especially among families who attend small private
religious schools or are homeschooled. </p>
<p>In New Mexico, all of the cases are in Lea County, which borders
Gaines County in Texas. The state health department has said people may
have been exposed at a grocery store, an elementary school, a church,
hospital and a pharmacy in Hobbs, New Mexico. </p>
<p>Measles is a highly contagious respiratory virus that can survive in
the air for up to two hours. Up to 9 out of 10 people who are
susceptible will get the virus if exposed, according to the U.S. Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention. </p>
<p>Most kids will recover from the measles if they get it, but infection
can lead to dangerous complications like pneumonia, blindness, brain
swelling and death. </p>
<p>The vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella is safe and highly
effective in preventing measles infection and severe cases of the
disease. </p>
<p>The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months
old and the second between 4 and 6 years old. The vaccine series is
required for kids before entering kindergarten in public schools
nationwide. </p>
<p>Before the vaccine was introduced in 1963, the U.S. saw some 3
million to 4 million cases per year. Now, it’s usually fewer than 200 in
a normal year. </p>
<p>There is no link between the vaccine and autism, despite a
now-discredited study and health disinformation. </p>
<p>In communities with high vaccination rates — above 95% — diseases
like measles have a harder time spreading through communities. This is
called “herd immunity.” </p>
<p>But childhood vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the
pandemic and more parents are claiming religious or personal conscience
waivers to exempt their kids from required shots. </p>
<p>The U.S. saw a rise in measles cases in 2024, including an outbreak
in Chicago that sickened more than 60.  </p>
<p>Gaines County has one of the highest rates in Texas of school-aged
children who opt out of at least one required vaccine, with nearly 14%
of K-12 children in the 2023-24 school year. Health officials say that
number is likely higher because it doesn’t include many children who are
homeschooled and whose data would not be reported. </p>
<p>Health workers are hosting regular vaccination clinics and screening
efforts in Texas, as well as working with schools to educate people
about the importance of vaccination and offering shots. </p>
<p>New Mexico health officials are also hosting several vaccination
clinics in Hobbs next week.</p>

states push back against possible election security changes</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Moves by U.S. President Donald Trump to potentially gut
programs aimed at supporting election security are not sitting well with
key state election officials, who are now asking the Trump
administration to reconsider.</p>
<p>The National Association of Secretaries of State sent a letter Friday
to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem warning that changes to the
department’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency could
endanger future elections.</p>
<p>“Information technology systems related to election administration
have long been targeted by sophisticated cyber threat actors including
nation-state and cybercriminal groups,” according to the letter, signed
by NASS president, Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon and NASS
president-elect, Mississippi Secretary of State Michael Watson.</p>
<p>“CISA’s prioritized services help election entities defend against
these national security threats,” they added.</p>
<p>NASS is a bipartisan group that represents chief election officials
from nearly 40 U.S. states. Simon is a Democrat. Watson is a
Republican.</p>
<p>The letter says that while U.S. elections “firmly remain a state and
local responsibility,” several initiatives from CISA have provided
valuable services and allowed for the sharing of critical information
for states that choose to participate.</p>
<p>It lists cybersecurity services, physical security assessments,
information through the Election Infrastructure Information Sharing and
Analysis Center (EI-ISAC), classified and unclassified intelligence
briefings and on-the-ground incident response services as among the
programs that NASS members would like to continue.</p>
<p>VOA has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security about the
letter but has not received a response.</p>
<p>CISA was formally created in 2018, charged with protecting the
country’s critical infrastructure. It has also served as a lead agency
on election security. DHS officials announced a review of the agency
earlier this month citing what they described as a need for CISA “to
refocus on its mission.”</p>
<p>“The agency is undertaking an evaluation of how it has executed its
election security mission with a particular focus on any work related to
mis-, dis-, and mal-information,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia
McLaughlin.</p>
<p>According to DHS, as of mid-February, more than 130 CISA employees
had been placed on administrative leave.</p>
<p>NASS expressed hope some of the election related programs can be
preserved, offering to meet with DHS officials, including Noem.</p>
<p>“[We] respect your authority to reassess existing priorities,
structures, staffing, and missions,” the NASS letter said. “We favor
continuity of the core resources above and welcome the opportunity as
Chief Election Officials to discuss any potential changes or impacts to
election security-related services before making a final decision.”</p>

<h2
id="trump-says-he-expects-ukraine-will-accept-mineral-deal-soon">Trump
says he expects Ukraine will accept mineral deal soon</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President Donald Trump said Friday that he expects Ukraine to
accept soon a proposed deal that would include U.S. investments in its
mineral assets to help recoup some U.S. defense funding. </p>
<p>“We’re signing an agreement, hopefully in the next fairly short
period of time, that will assure us that we’ll get four or $500 billion
back” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office when asked about a
potential deal.  </p>
<p>“It’s a big deal, but they [Ukrainians] want it, and it keeps us in
that country,” he said, adding “we get our money back. This should have
been signed long before we went in.” </p>
<p>The Trump administration has proposed the rare earth mineral deal as
part of a larger negotiation toward ending the war in Ukraine. </p>
<p>The president’s comments follow reports that his administration has
presented Kyiv with a revised version of a minerals agreement after
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy rejected the initial
proposal. </p>
<p>U.S. national security adviser Mike Waltz made similar comments
earlier Friday at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference
outside Washington.  </p>
<p>“Well, look, here’s the bottom line: President Zelenskyy is going to
sign that deal. And you will see that in the very short term. And that
is good for Ukraine,” he said. </p>
<p>The discussion about a mineral deal follows sharp exchanges this week
between Trump and Zelenskyy. The Ukrainian president, responding to
Trump’s suggestion that Ukraine started the war with Russia, said the
U.S. president was living in a Russian-influenced “disinformation
space.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Trump countered on his Truth Social platform, calling Zelenskyy a
“dictator without elections.”  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>On Friday, Trump referenced his indirect exchanges with Zelenskyy
while making comments to a gathering of the Republican State Governors
Association at the White House. The president described having “very
good talks with [Russian President Vladimir] Putin,” and “not such good
talks with Ukraine.” He mentioned how Ukraine talks “tough” but does not
have a lot of bargaining chips. </p>
<p>Diplomatic bomb </p>
<p>On Monday, the international community will hold a meeting in the
United Nations General Assembly marking the third anniversary of
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine, with the support of the European
Union, has circulated a draft resolution it plans to put to a vote at
the session.  </p>
<p>The document stresses “the urgent need to end the war this year”
through a “comprehensive, just and lasting peace” based on the
principles of the U.N. Charter and calls for the full withdrawal of
Russian troops from Ukraine “within its internationally recognized
borders.” </p>
<p>However, Ukraine’s plans were upended late Friday, when the Trump
administration circulated their own draft resolution. Entitled “The Path
to Peace,” the 65-word text mourns “the tragic loss of life throughout
the Russia-Ukraine conflict” and “implores a swift end to the conflict
and further urges a lasting peace between Ukraine and Russia.” </p>
<p>Diplomats said European ambassadors were meeting to discuss the
surprise move, which could hurt support for their text or even force
them to abandon the effort altogether. </p>
<p>Russia’s envoy told reporters the U.S. draft is “a good move.” </p>
<p>“But there is one important point missing,” Vassily Nebenzia said.
“The root causes. We should address the root causes.”   </p>
<p>His delegation circulated an amendment to Washington’s text adding
such a statement. </p>
<p>Moscow has long attempted to justify its illegal invasion of Ukraine
by saying Russian-speaking minorities in eastern Ukraine have been
persecuted by the Kyiv government. The Kremlin also has accused the
Ukrainian government of being “Nazis” and “fascists.”  </p>
<p>Moscow has also decried what it says is NATO expansionism into its
neighborhood. </p>
<p>Richard Gowan, U.N. director for the International Crisis Group, said
on social media platform X that he expects “the EU and Ukraine to table
counter-amendments and make the U.S. text unworkable.” </p>
<p>Ongoing discussions </p>
<p>Trump sent his special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, retired U.S.
Lieutenant General Keith Kellogg, for meetings Thursday with Zelenskyy
in Kyiv, Ukraine. Comments following that meeting indicated the
relationship between the U.S. and Ukraine was being smoothed over. </p>
<p>On his X social media account, Zelenskyy had only positive things to
say. </p>
<p>“My meeting with General Kellogg was one that restores hope, and we
need strong agreements with the U.S. — agreements that will truly work,”
Zelenskyy said. “I have instructed my team to work quickly and very
sensibly.” </p>
<p>Kellogg, from his X account, re-posted Zelenskyy’s comments, and
stated, “Extensive and positive discussions with [President Zelenskyy],
the embattled and courageous leader of a nation at war and his talented
national security team.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Much of the tension this past week surrounded talks about the war in
Ukraine between a U.S. delegation led by U.S. Secretary of State Marco
Rubio and their Russian counterparts in Saudi Arabia. No Ukrainian or
European representatives were present. </p>
<p>Rubio later noted that the meeting did not involve any fine points of
a deal. </p>
<p>When Trump was asked by reporters Friday if he would be going to
Moscow, the president dismissed such reports, saying “No, no I’m
not.” </p>
<p>Ukraine fears that Trump is moving to settle the war on terms that
could be more favorable to Moscow. Russia currently controls about a
fifth of Ukraine’s internationally recognized territory.</p>
<p>European leaders have responded to Trump’s recent remarks about
Ukraine by pledging to step up spending on defense, and some are
considering a U.S.-backed European peacekeeping force for the country if
the fighting ends. The Kremlin says the plan is a major cause for
concern, but Zelenskyy and NATO have welcomed it. </p>

id="suspect-found-guilty-of-attempted-murder-in-author-salman-rushdie-attack">Suspect
found guilty of attempted murder in author Salman Rushdie attack</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MAYVILLE, NEW YORK — A New Jersey man was convicted Friday of
attempted murder for stabbing author Salman Rushdie multiple times on a
New York lecture stage in 2022.</p>
<p>Jurors, who deliberated for less than two hours, also found Hadi
Matar, 27, guilty of assault for wounding a man who was on stage with
Rushdie at the time.</p>
<p>Matar ran onto the stage at the Chautauqua Institution where Rushdie
was about to speak on Aug. 12, 2022, and stabbed him more than a dozen
times before a live audience. The attack left the 77-year-old
prizewinning novelist blind in one eye.</p>
<p>Rushdie was the key witness during seven days of testimony,
describing in graphic detail his life-threatening injuries and long and
painful recovery.</p>
<p>Matar, sitting at the defense table, looked down but had no obvious
reaction when the jury delivered the verdict. As he was led out of the
courtroom in handcuffs, he quietly uttered, “Free Palestine,” echoing
comments he has frequently made while entering and leaving the
trial.</p>
<p>His public defender, Nathaniel Barone, said Matar was disappointed
but also well-prepared for the verdict.</p>
<p>District Attorney Jason Schmidt played a slow-motion video of the
attack for the jury Friday during his closing argument, pointing out the
assailant as he emerged from the audience, walked up a staircase to the
stage and broke into a run toward Rushdie.</p>
<p>“I want you to look at the unprovoked nature of this attack,” Schmidt
said. “I want you to look at the targeted nature of the attack. There
were a lot of people around that day but there was only one person who
was targeted.”</p>
<p>Assistant public defender Andrew Brautigan told the jury that
prosecutors have not proved that Matar intended to kill Rushdie. The
distinction is important for an attempted-murder conviction.</p>
<p>“You will agree something bad happened to Mr. Rushdie, but you don’t
know what Mr. Matar’s conscious objective was,” Brautigan said.</p>
<p>Matar had knives with him but no gun or bomb, his attorneys have said
previously. And in response to testimony that the injuries were
life-threatening, they have noted that Rushdie’s heart and lungs were
uninjured.</p>
<p>Schmidt said while it’s not possible to read Matar’s mind, “it’s
foreseeable that if you’re going to stab someone 10 or 15 times about
the face and neck, it’s going to result in a fatality.”</p>
<p>Schmidt reminded jurors about the testimony of a trauma surgeon, who
said Rushdie’s injuries would have been fatal without quick
treatment.</p>
<p>He also slowed down video showing Matar approaching the seated
Rushdie from behind and reaching around him to stab at his torso with a
knife. Rushdie raises his arms and rises from his seat, walking and
stumbling for a few steps with Matar hanging on, swinging and stabbing
until they both fall and are surrounded by onlookers who rush in to
separate them.</p>
<p>Rushdie is seen flailing on the ground, waving a hand covered in
bright red blood. Schmidt freezes on a frame showing Rushdie, his face
also bloodied, as he’s surrounded by people.</p>
<p>“We’ve shown you intent,” Schmidt said.</p>
<p>The recordings also picked up the gasps and screams from audience
members who had been seated to hear Rushdie speak with City of Asylum
Pittsburgh founder Henry Reese about keeping writers safe. Reese
suffered a gash to his forehead, leading to the assault charge against
Matar.</p>
<p>The judge set sentencing for April 23. Matar could receive up to 25
years in prison.</p>

<h2 id="lack-of-consensus-as-g20-meets-amid-turbulent-times">‘Lack of
consensus’ as G20 meets amid turbulent times</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>JOHANNESBURG — The two-day Group of 20 foreign ministers meeting
wrapped up in Johannesburg on Friday. Aimed at addressing global
problems, the talks between the world’s wealthiest countries instead
underscored the fault lines in the current geopolitical climate.</p>
<p>Despite the warm welcome foreign dignitaries received at the meeting
in Johannesburg, hosted by current G20 president South Africa, tensions
were apparent before the event even got underway.</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced earlier this month he
was boycotting the meeting, citing what he called the “anti-Americanism”
on the agenda. These topics included climate change and equality for
developing nations.</p>
<p>South African President Cyril Ramaphosa addressed the discord head on
in his opening speech, saying the world was under threat from rising
intolerance and wars.</p>
<p>“Yet there is a lack of consensus among major powers, including the
G20, on how to respond to these issues of global significance,”
Ramaphosa said.</p>
<p>Even a planned group photo fell through, though no official
explanation was given for its last-minute cancellation.</p>
<p>Steven Gruzd, an analyst at the South African Institute of
International Affairs, spoke about the challenges the meeting
presented.</p>
<p>“South Africa’s had a very difficult job of getting countries that
are ideologically very far apart around the same table,” he said.</p>
<p>South Africa has been under fire from the new U.S. administration,
which accuses the government of land grabs, an accusation South Africa
strongly denies. President Donald Trump recently cut financial
assistance to the country over the allegations.</p>
<p>Washington sent U.S. Embassy Charge d’Affaires Dana Brown in Rubio’s
place. The embassy declined VOA’s request for an interview.</p>
<p>But there were statements of support for South Africa leading the G20
from several European foreign ministers.</p>
<p>Russia and China also sent their top envoys.</p>
<p>In his remarks at the meeting, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi
expressed his support for South Africa’s G20 presidency.</p>
<p>He also noted that, “the current international landscape is marked by
transformation and turbulence.” He added, China will “work with all
parties” on world peace, security and multilateralism.</p>
<p>One topic that dominated at the meeting was Ukraine. The foreign
ministers gathered days after Trump upended U.S. policy on the war,
suggesting Ukraine was to blame for Russia’s 2022 invasion and labeling
one-time U.S. ally Volodymyr Zelenskyy as a “dictator.”</p>
<p>Retired U.S. diplomat Brooks Spector said, “Now that President Trump
has effectively ended the general Western consensus on Ukraine, it’s
obviously fallen to the European nations to be the primary source of
support for Ukraine and its president and in fact its struggle against
Russia.”</p>
<p>The E.U. has indeed rallied in support of Zelenskyy after Trump’s
comments. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot, speaking on the
sidelines of the meeting, voiced his concerns.</p>
<p>“A capitulation of Ukraine today would set a terrible example for
every country in the world that would be under the threat of predation
by its bigger neighbor,” he said. “Is this the world in which we want to
live?”</p>
<p>However, in his closing remarks South African foreign minister Ronald
Lamola put a positive spin on things, saying the meeting had been an
overall success and delegates had held “productive” talks.</p>

id="judge-cancels-new-york-city-mayors-trial-keeps-corruption-charges-intact">Judge
cancels New York City mayor’s trial, keeps corruption charges
intact</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — A federal judge on Friday canceled the corruption trial of
New York City Mayor Eric Adams. The judge also appointed counsel to
advise him on how to handle the Justice Department’s controversial
request to drop charges against the Democrat. </p>
<p>Judge Dale E. Ho’s written order means he won’t decide before
mid-March whether to grant the dismissal of the case against the mayor
of the nation’s largest city. </p>
<p>At a hearing Wednesday, Acting Deputy U.S. Attorney General Emil Bove
cited an executive order by President Donald Trump outlining his
criminal justice priorities as he defended the request to drop
charges. </p>
<p>Adams confirmed at the hearing that he accepted that charges could
later be reinstated. Critics suggest that the mayor would be required to
carry out Trump’s plans to round up New Yorkers who are in the country
illegally if he wanted to remain free from prosecution. </p>
<p>The request is “virtually unreviewable in this courtroom,” Bove
argued. </p>
<p>Adams was indicted in September and accused of accepting more than
$100,000 in illegal campaign contributions and travel perks from a
Turkish official and business leaders seeking to buy influence while he
was Brooklyn borough president. He faces multiple challengers in June’s
Democratic primary. He has pleaded not guilty and has insisted on his
innocence. </p>
<p>On Friday, the judge said he’d appointed Paul Clement, a former U.S.
solicitor general and acting U.S. attorney general, as amicus curiae to
present arguments on the government’s request to throw out the
charges. </p>
<p>Ho said he wanted all parties and Clement to address the legal
standard for dismissing charges, whether a court may consider materials
beyond the motion itself and under what circumstances additional
procedural steps and further inquiry would be necessary. </p>
<p>He also said he wants to know under what circumstances dismissal can
occur without the ability to reinstate charges or with the ability to
reinstate charges. He scheduled briefs to be filed by March 7 and, if
necessary, oral arguments to occur on March 14. </p>
<p>Late Thursday, three former U.S. attorneys — from New York,
Connecticut and New Jersey — submitted a letter urging Ho to “hear from
parties other than the government and the defendant in deciding about
the appropriate next steps.”  </p>
<p>Adams will not be required to attend future hearings, the judge
said. </p>
<p>That could help mitigate some political damage for Adams as he could
avoid being hauled back to court for hearings while he tries to convince
the public that the case isn’t distracting him from running the
city. </p>
<p>Adams has sought to project calm as questions over his independence
have sparked a political crisis in his administration. </p>
<p>This week, four of his top deputies resigned and Gov. Kathy Hochul
announced that she had for now decided against removing Adams from
office but would instead propose legislation to enhance state oversight
of City Hall as a way to reestablish trust with New Yorkers.</p>

Treasury’s Bessent, China’s He trade economic complaints in call</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent traded policy
complaints with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng on Friday, with Bessent
telling Beijing to do more to curb fentanyl trafficking and rebalance
its economy, and He voicing concerns about President Donald Trump’s new
tariffs, the two governments said.</p>
<p>The top economic officials from the world’s two largest economies
agreed to keep up communications, the Treasury said in a readout of the
introductory video call.</p>
<p>“Secretary Bessent expressed serious concerns about the PRC’s
counternarcotics efforts, economic imbalances, and unfair policies, and
stressed the Administration’s commitment to pursue trade and economic
policies that protect the American economy, the American worker, and our
national security,” the Treasury said, using the acronym for China’s
official name, the People’s Republic of China.</p>
<p>Earlier, Chinese state media reported that He expressed concerns to
Bessent over U.S. tariffs and trade restrictions on China during the
call.</p>
<p>The two sides had an “in-depth” exchange of views on important issues
in China-U.S. economic relations, and both agreed to keep communicating
on matters of mutual concern, according to a readout released by Chinese
state media.</p>
<p>He, the lead China-U.S. trade negotiator on the Chinese side, and
Bessent recognized the importance of bilateral economic and trade
relations, the readout said.</p>
<p>More tariffs</p>
<p>China and the United States are seeking to manage their relationship
as they stand on the precipice of a renewed trade war.</p>
<p>Trump imposed 10% tariffs on all Chinese goods in early February,
citing China’s failure to stanch fentanyl trafficking.</p>
<p>Beijing retaliated by imposing targeted tariffs of up to 15% on some
U.S. imports, including energy and farm equipment, and put several
companies, including Google, on notice for possible sanctions.</p>
<p>Trump has also planned further reciprocal tariffs for all countries
that tax U.S. imports, a move that is likely to further escalate global
trade tensions. During his election campaign, Trump threatened 60%
tariffs on all Chinese imports.</p>
<p>Trump said earlier this week he expected Chinese President Xi Jinping
to visit the U.S., without giving a timeline for such a trip.</p>
<p>Bessent said on Thursday he would tell his Chinese counterpart that
China needed to rebalance its economy and rely more on domestic
consumption for growth and less on investment and exports.</p>
<p>“They are suppressing the consumer in favor of the business
community,” Bessent told Bloomberg Television.</p>
<p>Similar arguments</p>
<p>The U.S. had a $295.4 billion goods trade deficit with China in 2024,
down from a peak of $418.2 billion in 2018, the year Trump began
imposing new tariffs on some $370 billion of Chinese imports.</p>
<p>But last year’s deficit rose $16.3 billion from 2023 as Chinese
exporters rushed to beat a new round of Trump tariffs.</p>
<p>Bessent’s predecessor, former Treasury secretary Janet Yellen, met
several times with He in recent years and lodged similar complaints
about China’s state-led economic policies.</p>
<p>She argued during a trip to China last year that those policies were
leading to excess production capacity that was threatening the viability
of firms in the U.S. and other market economies, a warning that laid the
groundwork for former President Joe Biden’s steep tariff hikes on
electric vehicles, semiconductors and solar products.</p>
<p>He and other Chinese officials never accepted U.S. excess capacity
assertions, arguing that China’s EV and other key industries are simply
more competitive.</p>

<h2 id="four-scenarios-for-securing-peace-in-ukraine">Four scenarios for
securing peace in Ukraine</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump is pushing for a peaceful
resolution to Russia’s now three-year full-scale war in Ukraine. VOA
examined several approaches floated by think tanks recently aimed at
achieving a lasting peace to the war.</p>
<p>Maximum pressure strategy</p>
<p>A plan by the Center for European Policy Analysis, or CEPA, titled
“How to Win: A Seven-Point Plan for Sustainable Peace in Ukraine,” calls
for “a maximum pressure strategy to bring Russia to the negotiating
table in good faith.”</p>
<p>It proposes that the U.S. and its allies:</p>
<pre><code>“Should provide immediate materiel support to Ukraine without caveats, aiming to wear down Russia’s military and thereby improve Ukraine’s negotiating position.”
“Should increase sanctions on Russian financial institutions and energy sector entities, release frozen Russian assets to support Ukrainian defense and reconstruction and enact secondary sanctions to intensify economic pressure not only on Russia but also on the authoritarian regimes of China, Iran, and North Korea.”</code></pre>
<p> </p>
<p>CEPA says that “Ukraine and Europe” must be included in any peace
talks with Russia, that the U.S. should support “a European-led
coalition of the willing” to enforce any “ceasefire line with an
international force,” and that “European allies must make consistent and
as rapid as possible progress toward Ukraine’s accession to the European
Union.”</p>
<p>One of the report’s authors, Catherine Sendak, CEPA’s director for
transatlantic defense and security, told VOA’s Ukrainian service that
the United States should enter talks with Russia only having “equipped
Ukraine with the strongest possible means” and using its toughest
“diplomatic tools.”</p>
<p>She added that the issue of Ukraine’s possible membership in NATO
should not be included in talks with Russia. “To discuss that with a
non-NATO member … I don’t believe it is advantageous to any
negotiation,” Sendak said, noting that it would give Russia “veto power,
if you will, over … choosing members to join the alliance or not.”</p>
<p>Negotiating tactics</p>
<p>Josh Rudolph, a German Marshall Fund senior fellow and head of its
Transatlantic Democracy Working Group, worked on Russian and Ukrainian
policy at the National Security Council during the first Trump
administration.</p>
<p>Last month, he offered policy recommendations to the current Trump
administration on ending the Ukraine conflict.</p>
<p>Among them:</p>
<pre><code>“Approach [Russian President Vladimir] Putin from a position of strength. Whereas Putin looked tough and capable at the outset of Trump’s first term, his blunder in Ukraine has left him diminished. … As the dominant partner in this relationship, Trump, not Putin, can set negotiating terms.”
“Know when to walk away. A critical moment in the negotiations will come when Putin refuses to make major concessions. Trump must be prepared to walk away.”
“Combine sanctions with lower oil and gas prices. The best way to make Putin to see that pressing on in Ukraine would spell disaster for his rule is to pressure Russia financially. … Harnessing his warmer relationship with Saudi Arabia than [former President Joe] Biden enjoyed, Trump should flood the fossil fuel market, which would make the sanctions sustainable, starve Russia’s war machine, and generate political stability risks in Moscow.”</code></pre>
<p> </p>
<p>Rudolph also recommended arming Ukraine “to the hilt”; giving it “all
$300 billion of Russia’s frozen assets”; making Europe “pay more for
weapons” and provide 100,000 troops as “peacekeepers”; enabling
“American companies to rebuild Ukraine”; and inviting Ukraine to join
NATO should Putin refuse to accept “reasonable” peace deal terms.</p>
<p>Rudolph told VOA that Trump could convince those in the U.S. now
skeptical of continuing to arm Ukraine that doing so as part of a peace
deal would benefit American workers.</p>
<p>“[H]e tells them, OK, now we’ve got a good deal, it’s secured by rare
earth [minerals], it has ended the war, and in order to hold it
together, we’re going to need to provide a continued stream of good old
American-made weapons, which by the way, create all of these American
jobs and facilities and factories across red states.”</p>
<p>Touting economic benefits</p>
<p>In a report titled “Dollars and Sense: America’s Interest in a
Ukrainian Victory,” Elaine McCusker, Frederick W. Kagan and Richard Sims
of the American Enterprise Institute looked at the cost of ending
support for Ukraine, concluding that this would lead to Ukraine’s defeat
and Russia’s advance farther into Europe, forcing the U.S. to surge its
presence in Europe.</p>
<p>Among the report’s conclusions:</p>
<pre><code>“Supporting Ukraine to victory against Russia is in the best interest of the United States.”
“A world in which Russia prevails would be more dangerous and more expensive for America — requiring an estimated increase of $808 billion in defense spending over five years.”
“Alternatively, an increased and accelerated multinational commitment to Ukraine and the conclusion of the war in the near term would result in a vibrant and free Ukraine with a newly modernized and battle-tested military and a thriving industrial base, which would help stabilize Europe.”</code></pre>
<p> </p>
<p>In an interview with VOA, Frederick Kagan said a Russian victory in
Ukraine would be a victory for Iran, China and North Korea, encouraging
adventurism in their respective regions, and allow Russia to rebuild its
army by obtaining additional human and material resources within
Ukraine.</p>
<p>A Russian takeover of Ukraine would send a wave of refugees into
Europe, further destabilizing the continent, Kagan said.</p>
<p>“They’ve committed atrocities on the Ukrainian population in the
areas they occupy. I would expect that would get worse the further west
the Russians move and the more they move into the hardest traditional
anti-Russian, pro-Western areas of western Ukraine. The horrors will be
unspeakable,” he predicted.</p>
<p>He said surged assistance to Ukraine would turn it into a bulwark for
European peace and security — a country with a battle-tested army and
rapidly developing military industry — thereby allowing the U.S. to
focus on other regions.</p>
<p>Middle road approach</p>
<p>The Heritage Foundation’s “Project 2025 Presidential Transition
Project” includes policy recommendations concerning the Russia-Ukraine
war.</p>
<p>It noted that the American conservative movement is split over
Ukraine — one side supports Kyiv, the other favors walking away — and
offered a middle road.</p>
<p>Among Project 2025’s recommendations:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;With respect to Ukraine, continued U.S. involvement must be fully paid for; limited to military aid (while European allies address Ukraine’s economic needs); and have a clearly defined national security strategy that does not risk American lives.”
“Regardless of viewpoints, all sides agree that Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is unjust and that the Ukrainian people have a right to defend their homeland. The conflict has severely weakened Putin’s military strength and provided a boost to NATO unity and its importance to European nations.”
“The next conservative president has a generational opportunity to bring resolution to the foreign policy tensions within the movement and chart a new path forward that recognizes Communist China as the defining threat to U.S. interests in the 21st century.”</code></pre>
<p> </p>
<p>James Carafano, a national security expert at The Heritage Foundation
who is responsible for its defense and foreign policy team, told VOA
that it is in the U.S. interest to have a free and independent Ukraine
that can defend itself.</p>
<p>“For the practical matter is, the United Europe can defend itself,
and the United States can defend Europe if Ukraine’s occupied by Russia.
Now, having said that, are we … way, way better off with the Russians on
the other side of Ukraine? And the answer is ‘absolutely.’”</p>
<p>In July, VOA published an interview with retired Army Lieutenant
General Keith Kellogg, serving as Trump’s envoy for Ukraine and Russia,
that focused on his vision of ending the war in Ukraine.</p>

<h2 id="rubio-highlights-emerging-terror-threat-in-afghanistan">Rubio
highlights emerging terror threat in Afghanistan</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD — U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggested late
Thursday there are ungoverned regions in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan
that provide opportunities for extremist groups to operate.</p>
<p>The comments came in an interview with former CBS correspondent
Catherine Herridge on X, where Rubio was asked if intelligence indicates
that al-Qaida and Islamic State had set up safe havens in Afghanistan,
posing a threat comparable to the one preceding the Sept. 11, 2001,
attacks.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t say it’s the pre-9/11 landscape, but I think anytime you
have governing spaces that are contested that you don’t have a
government that has full control of every part of their territory, it
creates the opportunity for these groups,” Rubio said.</p>
<p>“The difference between today and 10 years ago is that we don’t have
American elements on the ground to target and go after them,” the top
U.S. diplomat noted.</p>
<p>Rubio added that in some cases, the Taliban has been cooperative when
“told that ISIS or al-Qaida is operating in this part of your country”
and to go after them. Not so much in other cases, he said.</p>
<p>“So, I would say that I wouldn’t compare it to pre-9/11, but it’s
certainly far more uncertain — and it’s not just limited to
Afghanistan,” Rubio said.</p>
<p>The Taliban did not immediately respond to Rubio’s remarks, but they
have persistently claimed to be in control of the entire country and
rejected that any foreign terrorist organizations are on Afghan
soil.</p>
<p>Rubio’s comments came just days after the United Nations reported
that al-Qaida operatives continued to find shelter across Afghanistan
under the protection of the Taliban’s intelligence agency.</p>
<p>“The Taliban maintained a permissive environment allowing al-Qaida to
consolidate, with the presence of safe houses and training camps
scattered across Afghanistan,” read the report.</p>
<p>It also described an Afghan-based Islamic State affiliate, the
Islamic State-Khorasan, or IS-K, as “the greatest extra-regional
terrorist threat.”</p>
<p>The U.N. assessment highlighted that in addition to attacks on
Taliban authorities and Afghan religious minorities, IS-K supporters
conducted strikes as far away as Europe, and that the group “was
actively seeking to recruit from among Central Asian states” bordering
Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The Taliban militarily swept back to power in August 2021 when the
then-Afghan government collapsed as all U.S.-led NATO allied troops
withdrew from the country after a nearly two-decade-long presence.</p>

<h2 id="us-tax-agency-fires-6000-amid-federal-government-downsizing">US
tax agency fires 6,000 amid federal government downsizing</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A tearful executive at the U.S. Internal Revenue Service told
staffers on Thursday that about 6,000 employees would be fired, a person
familiar with the matter said, in a move that would eliminate roughly 6%
of the agency’s workforce in the midst of the busy tax-filing
season.</p>
<p>The cuts are part of President Donald Trump’s sweeping downsizing
effort that has targeted bank regulators, forest workers, rocket
scientists and tens of thousands of other government employees. The
effort is being led by tech billionaire Elon Musk, Trump’s biggest
campaign donor.</p>
<p>Musk was on stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference in
National Harbor, Maryland, when Argentine President Javier Milei, known
for wielding a chain saw to illustrate his drastic policies slashing
government spending, handed him one.</p>
<p>“This is the chain saw for bureaucracy,” said Musk, holding the power
tool aloft as a stage prop to symbolize the drastic slashing of
government jobs.</p>
<p>Labor unions have sued to try to stop the mass firings, under which
tens of thousands of federal workers have been told they no longer have
a job, but a federal judge in Washington on Thursday ruled that they can
continue for now.</p>
<p>Christy Armstrong, IRS director of talent acquisition, teared up as
she told employees on a phone call that about 6,000 of their colleagues
would be laid off and encouraged them to support each other, a worker
who was on the call said.</p>
<p>“She was pretty emotional,” the worker said.</p>
<p>The layoffs are expected to total 6,700, according to a person
familiar with the matter, and largely target workers at the agency hired
as part of an expansion under Democratic President Joe Biden, who had
sought to expand enforcement efforts on wealthy taxpayers. Republicans
have opposed the expansion, arguing that it would lead to harassment of
ordinary Americans.</p>
<p>The tax agency now employs roughly 100,000 people, compared with
80,000 before Biden took office in 2021.</p>
<p>Independent budget analysts had estimated that the staff expansion
under Biden would work to boost government revenue and help narrow
trillion-dollar budget deficits.</p>
<p>“This will ensure that the IRS is not going after the wealthy and is
only an agency that’s really focused on the low income,” said University
of Pittsburgh tax law professor, Philip Hackney, a former IRS lawyer.
“It’s a travesty.”</p>
<p>Those fired include revenue agents, customer-service workers,
specialists who hear appeals of tax disputes, and IT workers, and impact
employees across all 50 states, sources said. The IRS did not respond to
a request for comment.</p>
<p>The IRS has taken a more careful approach to downsizing than other
agencies, given that it is in the middle of the tax-filing season. The
agency expects to process more than 140 million individual returns by
the April 15 filing deadline and will retain several thousand workers
deemed critical for that task, one source said.</p>
<p>The Trump administration’s federal layoffs have focused on workers
across the government who are new to their positions and have fewer
protections than longer-tenured employees.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Trump White House is also preparing to dissolve the
leadership of the U.S. Postal Service and absorb the independent agency
into the Commerce Department, the Washington Post reported on
Thursday.</p>
<p>Waiting for dismissal email</p>
<p>At the IRS’s Kansas City office, probationary workers found all
functions had been disabled on their computers except email, which would
deliver their dismissal notices, said Shannon Ellis, a local union
leader.</p>
<p>“What the American people really need to understand is that the funds
that are collected through the Internal Revenue Service, they fund so
many programs that we use every day in our society,” Ellis told
Reuters.</p>
<p>The White House has not said how many of the nation’s 2.3 million
civil-service workers it wants to fire and has given no numbers on the
mass layoffs. Roughly 75,000 took a buyout offer last week.</p>
<p>The campaign has delighted Republicans for culling a federal
workforce they view as bloated, corrupt and insufficiently loyal to
Trump, while also taking aim at government agencies that regulate big
business – including those that oversee Musk’s companies SpaceX, Tesla
and Neuralink.</p>
<p>The small unit within the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration that regulates the kind of autonomous cars that Musk says
are the future of Tesla is losing nearly half of its staff, the Post
reported on Thursday.</p>
<p>Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency team has also canceled
contracts worth about $8.5 billion involving foreign aid, diversity
training and other initiatives opposed by Trump. Both men have set a
goal of cutting at least $1 trillion from the $6.7 trillion federal
budget, though Trump has said he will not touch popular benefits
programs that make up roughly one-third of that total.</p>
<p>Democratic critics have said Trump is exceeding his constitutional
authority and hacking away at popular and critical government programs
at the expense of legions of middle-class families.</p>
<p>Most Americans worry the cost-cutting could hurt government services,
according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released Thursday.</p>
<p>Some agencies have struggled to comply with the rapid-fire directives
Trump has issued since taking office a month ago. Workers who oversee
U.S. nuclear weapons were fired and then recalled, while medicines and
food exports have been stranded in warehouses by Trump’s freeze on
foreign aid.</p>

id="costa-rica-and-honduras-join-panama-as-stopovers-for-foreign-deportees">Costa
Rica and Honduras join Panama as stopovers for foreign deportees</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA — A group of families and children hailing from
Uzbekistan, China, Afghanistan, Russia and more countries climbed down
the stairs of an airplane in Costa Rica’s capital Thursday, the first
flight of deportees from other nations Costa Rica agreed to hold in
detention facilities for the Trump administration while it organized the
return back to their countries.</p>
<p>The flight of 135 deportees, half of them minors, added Costa Rica to
a growing list of Latin American nations to serve as a stopover for
migrants as U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration seeks to step
up deportations.</p>
<p>While Costa Rica joins Panama in holding deportees from mostly Asian
origin until their repatriation can be arranged or they can seek
protection somewhere, Honduras on Thursday also facilitated a handoff of
deportees between the U.S. and Venezuela from a flight coming from
Guantanamo Bay.</p>
<p>The migrants arriving in Costa Rica will be bused to a rural holding
facility near the Panama border, where they will be detained up to six
weeks and be flown back to their countries of origin, said Omer Badilla,
Costa Rica’s deputy minister of the interior and police.</p>
<p>The U.S. government will cover the costs.</p>
<p>The arrangement is part of a deal the Trump administration struck
with Costa Rica during U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s visit
earlier this month. It comes as Trump has pressured countries across the
region to help facilitate deportations at times under the threat of
steep tariffs or sanctions.</p>
<p>Costa Rican President Rodrigo Chaves told reporters Wednesday that
his country is helping its “economically powerful brother from the
north.”</p>
<p>Similar agreements have been reached with other Latin American
nations, but the concept of using third countries as deportation
layovers has drawn strong criticism from human rights advocates. Beyond
the conditions of their detention in Costa Rica, concerns revolve around
international protections for asylum seekers and whether these deportees
will be appropriately screened before being returned to their countries
or sent to yet another country.</p>
<p>Panama this week became the first such country to accept 299
deportees from other nations, with the government holding them in hotel
rooms guarded by police. About one-third of those who refused to
voluntarily return to their countries were sent to a remote camp in
Darien province bordering Colombia on Wednesday. The rest were awaiting
commercial flights back home.</p>
<p>“We’ve thrown out the possibility of a hotel, precisely to avoid a
situation similar to that in Panama,” Badilla, the Costa Rican official,
told The Associated Press.</p>
<p>Honduras said Thursday it also acted as a brief stopover for a
deportation flight of Venezuelans coming from Guantanamo Bay in what it
described as a “humanitarian bridge” since there are no direct flights
between the United States and Venezuela.</p>
<p>A U.S. flight carrying 170 Venezuelans landed Thursday in a joint
U.S.-Honduran military base in central Honduras, and within hours were
transferred to a Venezuelan aircraft. An official with Honduras’ foreign
ministry said this was not a routine arrangement, but that the Central
American nation remains open to facilitating more transfers between the
two adversaries.</p>
<p>Badilla said that Thursday’s deportation flight from San Diego is
largely made up of families, including 65 children, two pregnant women
and an elderly woman. He said Costa Rica was told by the Trump
administration that most of the deportees have agreed to voluntarily
return to their countries. If they refuse, Costa Rica is open to
offering deportees refuge or will work with the U.N.’s International
Organization for Migration, IOM, to facilitate travel to another third
country.</p>
<p>“Costa Rica is a country that guarantees human rights,” he said. “We
are going to guarantee that they are returned to safe countries. We
cannot leave that to chance because of an ethical and moral commitment
of our country.”</p>
<p>In the meantime, migrants will be detained in the border facility,
where they will be accompanied by U.N. officials, the Red Cross and
other aid-focused government entities to “guarantee their rights,”
Badilla said. The facility being used to hold migrants, a former
factory, has faced criticisms for its conditions in the past. During a
visit by the AP in October 2023, migrants were fenced off in cramped
facilities and said they felt like “prisoners.” Many slept in tents on
the ground, where some said liquid from portable toilets leaked.</p>
<p>Badilla said that facilities have since been improved, but the
government has denied journalists access to the building. The facility
will also be processing a “reverse flow” of migrants from Venezuela,
Colombia and Ecuador that previously sought asylum in the U.S. and now
want to return home.</p>
<p>Badilla said Costa Rica has seen between 50 and 75 migrants headed
south entering the country a day. IOM said in a statement to the AP that
“we do not have direct involvement in the detention or restriction of
movement of individuals” and that it was providing humanitarian support
and supporting voluntary returns to their countries and “identifying
safe alternatives for others.”</p>

id="south-korea-requests-exclusion-from-us-plan-to-increase-tariffs">South
Korea requests exclusion from US plan to increase tariffs</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korean officials have asked the Trump
administration to exclude their country from U.S. plans to impose
aggressive tariffs on trade partners, emphasizing that Seoul is already
applying low duties on American products under the free trade agreement
between the two nations.</p>
<p>South Korea’s government on Friday said Deputy Trade Minister Park
Jong-won made the request while traveling to Washington this week for
meetings with unspecified officials from the White House, the Department
of Commerce and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. The South
Korean Trade Ministry didn’t say what Park heard from the Americans.</p>
<p>Park cited how South Korean companies were contributing to the U.S.
economy through large-scale business investments and noted that the
country was already imposing low duties on free trade partners such as
the United States. He called for South Korea to be excluded from U.S.
plans to establish reciprocal tariffs with trade partners and raise
duties for imported steel and aluminum, the ministry said.</p>
<p>South Korea’s top economic think tank this month slashed its growth
forecast for the country’s economy for the second time since November,
expressing concern about the impact of U.S. President Donald Trump’s
expanding tariffs and other measures aimed at resetting global
trade.</p>
<p>The state-run Korea Development Institute projected the national
economy to grow by 1.6% in 2025, which was 0.4 percentage points lower
than its previous estimate. The group’s economists assessed that Trump’s
steel and aluminum tariffs won’t likely have a major impact on South
Korea’s economy, as those products account for less than 1% of its
exports to the U.S. However, they expressed concern that possible
increases in U.S. duties for semiconductors and cars would hurt the
country’s trade-dependent economy more.</p>
<p>South Korea’s acting president, Choi Sang-mok, on Friday called a
meeting with trade and foreign policy officials to discuss the potential
impact of Trump’s trade measures, including reciprocal tariffs and
possible product-specific duties for semiconductors, cars and
pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p>Choi, who is also South Korea’s finance minister, instructed
officials to examine how other major economies, including the European
Union, Japan and China, are responding to Trump’s trade policies, and
try harder to effectively communicate South Korea’s position to U.S.
officials.</p>
<p>South Korea’s trade surplus with the U.S. reached $55.7 billion in
2024. According to the South Korean trade ministry, the country’s tariff
rates on U.S. manufacturing imports is around zero percent.</p>

Senate Republicans push to pass border bill without Trump tax cuts</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate on Thursday began a debate on a
Republican bill to advance President Donald Trump’s priorities on
immigration, energy and defense, even after he urged lawmakers to scrap
the effort in favor of a House of Representatives bill that would also
include trillions of dollars in tax cuts.</p>
<p>Trump this week came down firmly in favor of House Republicans’ plan
for a single sweeping bill. Backers of that plan fear that passing an
immigration bill first could diminish their chances of extending $4.5
trillion in tax cuts in the House, where Republicans hold a narrow and
fractious 218-215 majority.</p>
<p>Senate Republicans said they would nonetheless push ahead with their
narrower plan and address tax cuts in a later bill. They are seeking to
bypass Democratic opposition in that chamber and secure an early
legislative win for Trump.</p>
<p>Democrats lack the votes to stop the bill but have vowed to fight it
as long as possible, accusing Republicans of shortchanging American
families to benefit the wealthy with tax breaks.</p>
<p>“We’re going to be here all night,” Senate Democratic Leader Chuck
Schumer proclaimed just before voting on amendments that began Thursday
evening.</p>
<p>Schumer introduced the first amendment, which seeks to prohibit tax
cuts for those earning more than $1 billion. Republicans blocked the
amendment.</p>
<p>Democratic Senator Tim Kaine put the Senate on notice that he alone
was seeking debate on about two dozen amendments ranging from
middle-class tax cuts to measures protecting federal workers from
termination and social safety net programs from cuts.</p>
<p>Republican Senate Budget Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham said
earlier in the evening that there was an urgent need to beef up border
security and the U.S. military. He argued that the higher spending
ordered in the legislation would be “offset with $342 billion in cuts in
other parts of the government.”</p>
<p>In a rarely used Senate process known as a “vote-a-rama,” amendments
can be offered until both parties agree to stop. Normally, the two
parties agree upon a narrow set of amendments for debate in the full
Senate on legislation.</p>
<p>Republicans, who hold a 53-47 advantage over Democrats in the Senate,
were expected to defeat scores of opposition amendments.</p>
<p>Both chambers of Congress need to pass the same budget resolution to
unlock the parliamentary tool that would enable Republicans to enact
Trump’s legislative agenda in a way that circumvents Democratic
opposition and the Senate filibuster.</p>
<p>Democrats made use of this maneuver in the first two years of Joe
Biden’s presidency, when they held majorities in both chambers of
Congress.</p>
<p>The Senate’s bill, which leaves the issue of Trump’s desired
extension of his 2017 tax cuts to a later date, could serve as a backup
in case the House Republicans cannot agree on how to pay for the tax
cuts in their bill without slashing funding for popular safety net
programs like Medicaid and Social Security or potentially adding to the
country’s $36 trillion debt.</p>
<p>The Senate measure, a $340 billion fiscal 2025 budget resolution,
would boost spending by $85 billion a year for four years to fund
tighter border security, Trump’s deportation of immigrants in the
country illegally, energy deregulation, and an increase in military
spending.</p>
<p>The House budget resolution includes those same priorities along with
$4.5 trillion in tax cuts, while seeking to cover the cost through $2
trillion in spending cuts and accelerated economic growth based mainly
on the tax and energy policy changes it would usher in.</p>

flies Venezuelan migrants from Guantanamo to Honduras</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The U.S. government flew 177 Venezuelan migrants from Guantanamo Bay
to Honduras on Thursday, from where they are set to be transferred on to
Venezuela, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department
of Homeland Security said.</p>
<p>Earlier on Thursday, the Honduran government said about 170
Venezuelan migrants were set to arrive in the Central American nation
from the United States, before being transported immediately back to
Venezuela.</p>
<p>The transfer of the migrants would take place at Soto Cano, a joint
U.S.-Honduras military air base, the Honduran government said.</p>
<p>Venezuela requested the repatriation of the citizens who it said were
unjustly taken to Guantanamo naval base, Foreign Minister Yvan Gil said
in a statement posted on Telegram, adding they would be flown from
Honduras by Venezuelan airline Conviasa.</p>
<p>The arrival in Venezuela is expected Thursday evening local time.</p>
<p>Lawyers representing at least half a dozen of the deportees said they
learned about the deportations on Thursday afternoon.</p>
<p>The deportations come after the American Civil Liberties Union filed
a lawsuit last week seeking access to dozens of migrants flown to the
U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, saying they were being denied
the right to an attorney.</p>
<p>The deportees included 126 people with criminal charges or
convictions, 80 of whom were allegedly affiliated with Tren de Aragua, a
Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said, adding that 51 had no
criminal record.</p>
<p>There are no migrant detainees left at Guantanamo after Thursday’s
deportations, the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>The U.S. has designated Tren de Aragua a global terrorist
organization along with other organized crime groups, as President
Donald Trump steps up immigration enforcement against alleged gang
members in the United States.</p>

<h2 id="trump-order-challenges-independence-of-fcc-other-agencies">Trump
order challenges independence of FCC, other agencies</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump this week signed an executive
order intended to expand the White House’s authority over various
independent regulatory agencies that Congress set up to be shielded from
direct White House control, including the U.S. Federal Communications
Commission.</p>
<p>The order, signed Tuesday, would require independent agencies to
submit proposed regulations to the White House for review. The order
also would require agencies to consult with the White House on their
“policies and priorities” and “strategic plans.”</p>
<p>“These regulatory agencies currently exercise substantial executive
authority without sufficient accountability to the President, and
through him, to the American people,” the order said.</p>
<p>The executive order, titled “Ensuring Accountability for All
Agencies,” is expected to face challenges in court, according to legal
experts.</p>
<p>The move came as the president has worked to consolidate power within
the executive branch, including by removing more than a dozen inspectors
general who provided oversight at various government agencies.</p>
<p>In addition to the FCC, agencies that would be affected by the new
order include the Federal Trade Commission and the Securities and
Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>The FCC does not directly regulate major news networks, but it does
evaluate the actions of broadcasting stations around the U.S. that hold
FCC licenses to use public airwaves.</p>
<p>Former FCC chairs told VOA that the move would be a significant
change for the FCC.</p>
<p>“It makes an independent agency that was created to be independent
like an agency in the executive branch,” said Tom Wheeler, who served as
FCC chairman under former President Barack Obama.</p>
<p>Reed Hundt, who served as FCC chairman under former President Bill
Clinton, agreed that the order would mark a departure from the agency’s
nearly 100-year history.</p>
<p>“For 90 years, the governmental idea was that the president should
not be regulating the media,” Hundt told VOA.</p>
<p>Harold Furchtgott-Roth, a Republican who served as an FCC
commissioner under Clinton, told VOA that the order “would have a major
effect on rulemaking” at the FCC. He added that other areas, like
enforcement, might not be affected.</p>
<p>Democratic FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez told VOA that she was
concerned by the order.</p>
<p>“Our informed decision-making is meant to be consistent with our
technical expertise, not subject to political pressure,” Gomez told VOA
in an emailed statement.</p>
<p>Gomez added that Congress already provides oversight over the FCC.
“Efforts to expand executive influence on the FCC will only further
diminish our standing as a stable, independent and expert-driven
regulatory body,” said Gomez, who has served as a commissioner since
2023.</p>
<p>Trump-appointed FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, as well as Commissioners
Geoffrey Starks and Nathan Simington, did not immediately reply to VOA’s
emails requesting comment on the order. Carr and Simington are
Republicans, Starks is a Democrat.</p>
<p>Kim Zarkin, a professor of communication at Westminster University in
Utah who has researched the FCC for three decades, said she thought it
was important for the FCC and other independent agencies to remain as
nonpolitical as possible.</p>
<p>Even though commissioners at agencies such as the FCC are nominated
by the president, “there was always this expectation that these were
meant to be nonpolitical,” Zarkin told VOA. “They were meant to bring in
expertise.”</p>
<p>Zarkin, who has written two books on the FCC, said time will tell
whether the order has any material impact on how the FCC and other
agencies operate.</p>
<p>Trump’s executive order comes amid concerns that the FCC is being
weaponized to intimidate broadcasters through investigations, according
to Democratic FCC commissioners and media law experts.</p>
<p>The FCC is currently investigating broadcasters, including NPR, PBS,
CBS and NBC.</p>
<p>The FCC is investigating whether NPR and PBS member stations violated
FCC rules on airing commercial ads. Both broadcasters deny
wrongdoing.</p>
<p>The CBS inquiry pertains to whether the broadcaster doctored an
October “60 Minutes” interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris.
That interview is also at the center of a $10 billion lawsuit from
Trump.</p>
<p>CBS denied wrongdoing when Trump filed the lawsuit. Earlier this
month, CBS published the interview’s unedited transcripts, which showed
“60 Minutes” and “Face the Nation” used slightly different parts of the
same answer from Harris, which is common journalistic practice.</p>
<p>The NBC investigation is into the company’s diversity, equity and
inclusion practices.</p>
<p>Democratic FCC commissioners and media law experts have expressed
concern about the investigations.</p>

<h2 id="us-state-department-tweaks-online-fact-sheet-on-china">US State
Department tweaks online fact sheet on China</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — PRC is out. China is in.</p>
<p>That is among the significant modifications to the U.S. State
Department’s online fact sheet on China, which drops the country’s
official name, the People’s Republic of China (PRC), in favor of just
China.</p>
<p>Former President Joe Biden’s administration routinely referenced the
Beijing government with the PRC abbreviation. Since former President
Richard Nixon began the process to normalize relations with Beijing —
which would end recognition of the government in Taipei, officially
known as the Republic of China, on Jan. 1, 1979 — the United States has
maintained diplomatic ties with the communist-run government on the
mainland, while reducing the relationship with Taiwan to unofficial but
friendly. </p>
<p>“Taipei should take solace in the fact that the change in the term
[from PRC to China] does not represent a policy change in the United
States. The fact of the matter is that the U.S. still has its ‘One
China’ policy, and under that policy, it maintains diplomatic relations
with Beijing and robust unofficial relations with Taipei,” Russell
Hsiao, Global Taiwan Institute executive director, told VOA.</p>
<p>“Since 1979, Washington has recognized the government in Beijing of
the People’s Republic of China as the sole legal government of China, so
the change in term is essentially a different way of presenting the same
set of facts, all of which haven’t changed,” Hsiao said.</p>
<p>China considers Taiwan a rogue province. Nationalist forces, backed
by the United States and commanded by Chiang Kai-shek, fled the mainland
for Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war to the communist forces led
by Mao Zedong. Chiang became Taiwan’s relatively benign dictator until
his death in 1975. Mao ruled over the mainland as a rigid authoritarian
until his death a year after Chiang died.</p>
<p>Washington continues to provide Taipei with weapons and has left the
question ambiguous as to whether the United States would use its
military to defend the island if Taiwan were to be attacked. The Taiwan
Relations Act commits the United States to help Taiwan defend itself,
but the final decision on military intervention would rest with the
president and Congress.</p>
<p>Language changes last week by the State Department eliminated a
reference to Washington not supporting Taiwan independence, but left
intact was content noting that the United States opposes “unilateral
changes to the status quo” by either side of the Taiwan Strait.</p>
<p>A significant change to the State Department’s web page on China,
however, is the deletion of content on cooperating with allies on
China-related issues and on helping Beijing with cultural matters and
environmental protections. Instead, there is new language focusing on
the U.S.-China trade relationship, noting the difficulty for American
businesses to operate in China and that the Chinese economy is “one of
the most restrictive investment climates in the world.”</p>
<p>Yet another shift in tone, in line with rhetoric used by President
Donald Trump’s administration, is reflected by frequent references to
the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The party is directly accused of
trying to “manipulate and subvert” United Nations organizations and
other international bodies and seeking to “groom and install CCP members
in leadership and other positions” in such groups.</p>
<p>In the newly edited fact sheet, the CCP is also blamed for “malicious
cyber activity against U.S. government, private sector and critical
infrastructure networks.” The document now notes the United States is
dedicated to countering these activities “to help protect American
citizens, businesses and industries.”</p>
<p>“These moves reflect an overall sense in Washington and within the
Trump administration that engagement with China has failed and a tougher
approach is warranted,” Rorry Daniels, managing director of the Asia
Society Policy Institute, told VOA.</p>
<p>“This mood has been building — particularly in Congress — for years,
and a change of emphasis is no surprise. However, swapping out PRC for
China reflects a deeper and more dangerous narrative that attacks the
CCP’s legitimacy as the governing authority of China. I expect this will
be viewed with grave concern by Beijing and raised at the highest levels
in the coming days and weeks,” added Daniels.</p>
<p>Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun, responding during
Thursday’s regular press briefing, expressed strong dissatisfaction with
the website changes.</p>
<p>The State Department’s actions “misrepresent the facts, attack
China’s foreign policy and peddle the so-called China-U.S. strategic
competition. We strongly deplore and firmly oppose it,” Guo said.</p>
<p>The changes come after Trump imposed an additional 10% tariff on all
imports from China. The president said he was taking the action because
Beijing’s government has failed to stop the flow into the United States
of the illicit opioid fentanyl.</p>
<p>Trump has also announced he intends to put in place further
retaliatory tariffs on all trading partners that limit access for U.S.
goods into their markets.</p>

id="trump-administration-reduces-deportation-protections-for-521000-haitians">Trump
administration reduces deportation protections for 521,000 Haitians</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Thursday
cut the duration of deportation protections and work permits for 521,000
Haitians covered by the Temporary Protected Status program so that they
will expire in August, a Homeland Security Department spokesperson
said.</p>
<p>The decision reverses a Biden administration move last year to extend
the protections through February 2026, the spokesperson said, saying the
extension was unjustified.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump, a Republican, tried to end most enrollment in
the TPS program during his 2017-2021 presidency but was blocked by
federal courts. Noem earlier this month revoked a Biden-era TPS
extension for some 600,000 Venezuelans and terminated the status for
half of them, whose protections and access to work permits expire in
April.</p>
<p>Trump falsely said during a September 2024 debate with Democrat
Kamala Harris that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, were eating
pets, sparking fear of retaliation among Haitians in the city. Trump
said a month later that if elected he would revoke TPS for Haitians and
deport them.</p>
<p>Noem will now need to decide whether to terminate the status for
Haitians.</p>
<p>“President Trump and I are returning TPS to its original status:
temporary,” she said in a statement.</p>
<p>More than 1 million people, more than half of them children, are now
displaced within Haiti where gang violence continues unabated despite
the start of a United Nations-backed security mission last year, U.N.
data published in January showed.</p>
<p>Haiti has lacked elected representatives since 2023 and has not held
elections since 2016. The country’s capital is almost entirely
controlled by armed gangs, and leaders have said security must first be
established to hold a free and fair vote.</p>

id="eu-official-meets-with-trump-counterparts-to-resolve-tariff-threats">EU
official meets with Trump counterparts to resolve tariff threats</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Hoping to head off a potential trade conflict, a top
European Union official stressed the importance of active engagement and
fairness in trade during a four-hour meeting with Trump administration
officials.</p>
<p>“The top objective as it was presented to us yesterday by our
American partners is reciprocity,” Maros Sefcovic, the European
commissioner for trade and economic security, told reporters at a
Thursday briefing.</p>
<p>Sefcovic met on Wednesday with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick,
White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett and
Jamieson Greer, President Donald Trump’s nominee to be the U.S. trade
representative.</p>
<p>Trump has thrown the decades long partnership between the U.S. and
Europe into turmoil by pledging to charge higher taxes on imports from
Europe that he says would match the tariffs faced by American
products.</p>
<p>But Trump’s plan for fair tariffs would also include the value added
tax — which is akin to a sales tax — charged in Europe that could
drastically push up import taxes and potentially trigger a broader trade
conflict if the EU imposed retaliatory measures. A broader trade war
risks both an economic slowdown and higher inflation that could create
financial challenges for millions of families and potentially hurt
political support for Trump, as voters in 2024’s election specifically
wanted him to lower price pressures.</p>
<p>Trump also has proposed separate sectoral tariffs on autos,
pharmaceutical drugs and computer chips, in addition to having already
imposed 25% steel and aluminum tariffs with no avenues to provide
exceptions or exemptions.</p>
<p>Additionally, the U.S. president also has tariffs ready on Mexico and
Canada over his claims that more should be done on illegal immigration
and drug smuggling, though he suspended those tariffs for 30 days for
ongoing talks. The import taxes that could potentially harm the U.S.
auto sector and other industries could potentially begin in March.</p>
<p>At Thursday’s White House news briefing, Hassett said that he and
Lutnick had talks with a Mexican delegation about resolving the
issues.</p>
<p>“We want trade to be fair,” Hassett said.</p>
<p>The EU official tried in his conversation with White House officials
to equate the value added tax as similar to a sales tax as its paid by
the final consumer, but he said that the issue had not been
resolved.</p>
<p>Sefcovic also said they discussed the industrial overcapacity of
China, particularly in steel, and that the U.S. and EU should work
together to tackle that problem, instead of targeting each other.</p>
<p>He stressed that the meeting ended with a focus on looking for ways
to “generate positive momentum,” adding that the EU would like to “see
where we can, like, move first and fast, because I really would like to
avoid the pain of measures and countermeasures.”</p>
<p>The EU official said it was critical to establish a personal
relationship with his U.S. counterparts.</p>
<p>“I’m glad that it happened and that we could have such an intense
meeting,” he said. “Now, I think we will both be thinking how to keep
the momentum going on and how to hopefully avoid I would say, the
pain.”</p>

strengthen their AI capacity building. Observers said that China is
selling its AI software to targeted regions, which can challenge U.S. AI
and serve as a strategy for Chinese companies to get more business
overseas.</p>

<h2 id="trump-loyalist-kash-patel-takes-helm-of-fbi">Trump loyalist Kash
Patel takes helm of FBI</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Trump administration’s makeover of the United
States’ national security and law enforcement agencies took a major step
forward Thursday, with Senate lawmakers voting 51-49 to confirm Kash
Patel as the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).</p>
<p>The vote puts Patel at the helm of the country’s premier law
enforcement agency, where he has promised to lead an overhaul of the
bureau at a time when critics of President Donald Trump have accused the
administration of leading a purge to end the bureau’s tradition of
independence and align the bureau with Trump’s priorities.</p>
<p>Two Republicans — Senators Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski — voted
with Democrats against Patel’s confirmation. But support from the rest
of the Senate Republican delegation gave Patel a slim victory, with many
hailing the new FBI director as an agent of change.</p>
<p>“The FBI has lost trust among the American people in recent years.
Much of that stems from a perception that politics has infected the
FBI’s important work,” said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, ahead of
Thursday’s vote.</p>
<p>“We need all law enforcement working together and focused on the real
threats facing our country,” Thune said. “I look forward to working with
Mr. Patel to restore the integrity of the FBI and get it focused on its
critical mission.”</p>
<p>Other Republicans have echoed similar sentiments.</p>
<p>“The FBI has been infected by political bias and weaponized against
the American people,” said Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck
Grassley before advancing Patel’s nomination to the full Senate earlier
this month, noting “Mr. Patel knows it, Mr. Patel exposed it, and
Mr. Patel was targeted.”</p>
<p>“The American people are sick and tired of two tiers of access, two
tiers of treatment, and two tiers of justice,” said Republican Senator
Marsha Blackburn, also speaking earlier this month on the need for Patel
to head the FBI.</p>
<p>Patel is a former public defender and federal prosecutor who
previously served as a Trump national security adviser and at the
Pentagon.</p>
<p>In a statement announcing Patel’s nomination in November, Trump
praised him as having “played a pivotal role in uncovering the Russia,
Russia, Russia hoax, standing as an advocate for truth, accountability
and the Constitution.”</p>
<p>Democrats, however, have repeatedly questioned Patel’s qualifications
and integrity, accusing him of describing some of the prosecuted,
Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol rioters as “political prisoners,” and of calling
for the prosecution of Trump opponents.</p>
<p>And citing whistleblowers, they have accused Patel of lying to
lawmakers about knowledge of efforts at the FBI to force out officials
and agents who were assigned to investigate the Capitol Hill riot.</p>
<p>“He is unprepared and unqualified. He has an enemies list. He has
these foreign entanglements,” said Democratic Senator Richard
Blumenthal, rallying against Patel’s confirmation in front of FBI
headquarters in Washington before Thursday’s vote.</p>
<p>“To Republicans who may vote for Kash Patel, this vote will haunt
you,” he said. “You will rue the day of this vote.”</p>
<p>Democrat Peter Welch, also speaking in front of FBI headquarters,
called Patel “a crown jewel” in what he described as a “lawless rampage”
by Trump.</p>
<p>“He’s an instrument of Donald Trump’s effort to destroy the Justice
Department and the FBI so that he is absolutely and completely not only
above the law, but beyond the law,” Welch said.</p>
<p>Patel, during his confirmation hearing last month, rejected
accusations he has an enemies list or that he will seek retribution
against Trump’s opponents or enemies.</p>
<p>“I have no interest nor desire and will not, if confirmed, go
backwards,” Patel told lawmakers. “There will be no politicization at
the FBI. There will be no retributive actions taken by the FBI.”</p>
<p>“The only thing that will matter if I’m confirmed as a director of
the FBI is a de-weaponized, de-politicized system of law enforcement
completely devoted to rigorous obedience to the Constitution and a
singular standard of justice,” he said.</p>
<p>The FBI director is appointed by the president and confirmed by the
Senate for a term not to exceed 10 years.</p>

id="mcconnell-longest-serving-us-senate-leader-to-retire-in-early-2027">McConnell,
longest-serving US Senate leader, to retire in early 2027</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. Senator Mitch McConnell announced on Thursday, his 83rd
birthday, that he will not seek reelection when his current term ends
next year.</p>
<p>First elected in 1984, McConnell made the announcement from the
Senate floor.</p>
<p>“Seven times, my fellow Kentuckians have sent me to the Senate. Every
day in between, I’ve been humbled by the trust they’ve placed in me to
do their business here,” he said. “Representing our commonwealth has
been the honor of a lifetime. I will not seek this honor an eighth time.
My current term in the Senate will be my last.”</p>
<p>McConnell, a former Republican Majority Leader, will retire as the
longest-serving Senate leader from any party. He has led the Republicans
since 2007 both as majority and minority leader before giving up the
position to Senator John Thune last year.</p>
<p>McConnell’s storied political career saw him guide the Senate chamber
through a $1.5 trillion tax overhaul, presidential impeachment trials
and fierce political fights.</p>
<p>In what may be a lasting feature of his legacy, McConnell
aggressively sought to outfit federal courts with more conservative
justices. His final years as head of the Senate Republicans saw repeated
political clashes with an increasingly populist party under the
leadership of President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>In recent years, McConnell had a series of health scares, including
two separate incidents in which he froze while talking to reporters. He
blamed those incidents on a previous concussion.</p>
<p>In his comments Thursday, McConnell said he decided last year that he
would not run for reelection.</p>

Reuters.</p>

id="zelenskyy-strong-ukraine-relations-with-us-benefit-entire-world">Zelenskyy:
Strong Ukraine relations with US ‘benefit entire world’</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Thursday that “strong
Ukraine-U.S. relations benefit the entire world,” an apparent attempt to
calm tensions with Washington after he and U.S. President Donald Trump
traded barbs this week over efforts to end Russia’s three-year war on
Ukraine.</p>
<p>Zelenskyy said in Kyiv he had a “productive meeting” with Trump envoy
Keith Kellogg on the “battlefield situation, how to return our prisoners
of war and effective security guarantees” for Ukraine if the war is
ended.</p>
<p>Earlier in the week, Zelenskyy had complained that Ukraine was
excluded from high-level talks in Saudi Arabia between the top U.S. and
Russian diplomats as they discussed setting up negotiations about how to
end the war and contended that Trump was living in a Russian-influenced
“disinformation space.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Trump called Zelenskyy a “dictator without elections” and
claimed falsely that Ukraine started the war three years ago next week,
even though Russian President Vladimir Putin initiated it.</p>
<p>Kellogg said he went to Kyiv to listen to Zelenskyy’s views and would
report back to Trump.</p>
<p>The Trump administration has proposed that part of the settlement of
war would involve the U.S. investing in Ukrainian mining operations. The
U.S. would gain access to rare earth minerals it needs for the
manufacture of American technology products and recoup some of the money
for the tens of billions of dollars’ worth of munitions it has sent to
Ukraine to fight Russian forces while also boosting the war-ravaged
Ukrainian economy.</p>
<p>Zelenskyy so far has balked at the proposition for what he sees as
lack of adequate security for Ukraine if the war is ended.</p>
<p>In Washington, Mike Waltz, Trump’s national security adviser, told
reporters, “We’re going to continue to have discussions about where that
deal is going again. We have an obligation to the taxpayer. I think this
is an opportunity. The president thinks this is an opportunity for
Ukraine.</p>
<p>“Going forward, there can be, in my view, nothing better for
Ukraine’s future and for their security than to have the United States
invested in their prosperity long term,” Waltz said. “And then a key
piece of this has also been security guarantees. Look, the reality that
we’re talking about here is, is it in Ukraine’s interest? Is it in
Europe’s interest? It certainly isn’t in Russia’s interest or in the
American people’s interest, for this war to grind on forever and ever
and ever.</p>
<p>“Understand, this war needs to come to an end, this kind of
open-ended mantra [supporting Ukraine military operations] that we had
under [President Joe Biden’s] administration, that’s over, and I think a
lot of people are having a hard time accepting that,” he said.</p>
<p>Ukraine fears that Trump is moving to settle the war on terms more
favorable to Moscow. Russia currently controls about a fifth of
Ukraine’s internationally recognized territory.</p>
<p>U.S. Vice President JD Vance told a gathering of conservative
activists outside Washington on Thursday that Trump “wants the killing
to stop” in Ukraine and that “peace is in the interest of the American
people.”</p>
<p>After the U.S.-Russian talks in Riyadh, “we’re on the cusp of peace,”
he said, not mentioning Ukraine’s role in settling the conflict. U.S.
officials have said Kyiv and Moscow will both be involved in the
settlement and will have to make concessions to achieve peace.</p>
<p>European leaders have responded to Trump’s recent remarks about
Ukraine by pledging to step up spending on defense, and some are
considering a U.S.-backed European peacekeeping force for the country if
the fighting ends. The Kremlin says the plan is a major cause for
concern, but Zelenskyy and NATO have welcomed it.</p>
<p>Watch related video by Katherine Gypson:</p>
<p>“It is vital that … Russia will never again try to take one more
square kilometer of Ukrainian land,” NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte
said, adding that a peace pact would have to entail robust security
guarantees for Ukraine.</p>
<p>“While there is much that still needs to be decided, there is no
question that Europe has a vital role to play in securing peace in
Ukraine,” he told reporters in Bratislava, Slovakia.</p>
<p>In a string of comments on his Truth Social platform this week, Trump
accused Zelenskyy of refusing to hold elections in Ukraine, which had
been scheduled for April 2024 but were delayed after Russia invaded in
2022.</p>
<p>Trump disparaged Zelenskyy as “a modestly successful comedian” and
said, “The only thing he was good at was playing Biden ‘like a fiddle’”
for more U.S. military assistance.</p>
<p>“I love Ukraine,” Trump said, “but Zelenskyy has done a terrible job,
his Country is shattered, and MILLIONS have unnecessarily died — And so
it continues.”</p>
<p>Earlier, Trump had scoffed at Zelenskyy’s complaint about not being
invited to the Tuesday talks in Riyadh, which were headed by U.S.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey
Lavrov.</p>
<p>“Today I heard, ‘Well, we weren’t invited.’ Well, you’ve been there
for three years,” Trump said of Ukraine’s leaders.</p>

Korea criticizes US over AUKUS nuclear submarine deal</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — North Korean state media on Thursday criticized
the United States for a nuclear submarine deal with Australia under the
AUKUS partnership signed in 2021, calling it a “threat to regional
peace.”</p>
<p>A commentary carried by KCNA said Washington should be wary of
consequences for what it said were nuclear alliances, naming AUKUS and
the trilateral cooperation with South Korea and Japan.</p>
<p>Australia just made its first $500 million payment to the U.S. under
the AUKUS nuclear submarine deal.</p>
<p>Under AUKUS, Australia will pay the United States $3 billion to boost
the capacity of the U.S. submarine industry, and Washington will sell
several Virginia-class nuclear-powered submarines to Australia in the
early 2030s.</p>
<p>The KCNA commentary also argued the U.S. sees North Korea as an
obstacle to its establishment of hegemony in the region and said nuclear
states will not sit idly by, referring to itself.</p>
<p>North Korea has been criticizing the trilateral military cooperation
between South Korea, Japan and the U.S. and has called the relationship
“the Asian version of NATO.”</p>
<p>South Korea’s defense ministry on Thursday said that a joint air
drill was held with the U.S. with at least one B-1B strategic bomber
taking part.</p>
<p>The drill was to show extended deterrent capabilities by the United
States in response to threats from North Korea’s nuclear and missile
program, the ministry said in a statement.</p>

id="trump-expects-visit-from-chinese-president-xi-without-giving-timeline">Trump
expects visit from Chinese President Xi without giving timeline</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE/ WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump said
on Wednesday he expected Chinese President Xi Jinping to visit the
United States, without giving a timeline for his trip.</p>
<p>Trump made the remarks to reporters on Air Force One and said “it’s
possible” for the U.S. and China to have a new trade deal. A
conversation or interaction between Xi and Trump is seen as crucial to a
potential easing or delay of trade tariffs.</p>
<p>“We’ll have, ultimately, President Xi, we will have everybody coming
(to the U.S.),” Trump said, while also speaking about other leaders
potentially visiting the United States.</p>
<p>Xi last travelled to the U.S. in November 2023, in his fifth visit to
the country as Chinese president, for a summit with then U.S. President
Joe Biden, resulting in agreements to resume military-to-military
communications and curb fentanyl production.</p>
<p>Trump and Xi had spoken just before Trump took office on January 20
and discussed issues including TikTok, trade and Taiwan.</p>
<p>Trump told reporters on Wednesday that he was talking to China about
TikTok as the United States seeks to broker a sale of the popular app
owned by Chinese parent firm ByteDance.</p>
<p>Trump said last week he had spoken to Xi since taking office as well,
but did not offer details on the topics of that conversation. China’s
foreign ministry did not directly comment on Trump’s remarks that day
and instead referred reporters to their “scheduled” call before Trump
took office.</p>
<p>Washington and Beijing have had tense relations for years over
differences ranging from trade and tariffs and cybersecurity, and
TikTok, Taiwan, Hong Kong, human rights and the origins of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Trump also again told reporters he could make a deal with Russia over
the war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>“We can make a deal with Russia to stop the killing,” Trump said,
adding he thought the Russians wanted to see the war end.</p>
<p>“I think they have the cards a little bit because they’ve taken a lot
of territory, so they have the cards,” Trump said.</p>

id="native-american-activist-leonard-peltier-freed-from-prison-welcomed-on-reservation">Native
American activist Leonard Peltier, freed from prison, welcomed on
reservation</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BELCOURT, NORTH DAKOTA — Native American activist Leonard Peltier was
defiant toward the government but grateful for his supporters as they
welcomed him home to North Dakota on Wednesday, a day after his release
from a Florida prison where he had been serving a life sentence in the
1975 killings of two FBI agents. </p>
<p>Peltier, 80, grew emotional as he addressed about 500 people who
gathered at the festive event that included food, a drum circle and
dancers at a center in Belcourt. The small town is just south of the
Canadian border on the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians’
reservation. </p>
<p>“I’m so proud of the showing and support you’ve given me,” Peltier
said. “I’ve got a hard time keeping myself from crying. A strong warrior
can’t be up crying in front of his people.” </p>
<p>Before leaving office, former President Joe Biden commuted Peltier’s
life sentence to home confinement, leading to his release Tuesday from
the Coleman penitentiary. Peltier was convicted of two counts of
first-degree murder and given two consecutive life sentences stemming
from a 1975 confrontation on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South
Dakota. </p>
<p>FBI agents Jack Coler and Ronald Williams were killed, and while
Peltier acknowledged firing shots during the confrontation, he denied
being the person whose shots killed the men. Native Americans widely
believe he was a political prisoner who was wrongly convicted because he
fought for Indigenous rights as a member of the American Indian
Movement. </p>
<p>For years, many in law enforcement argued against freeing Peltier.
Current and former FBI agents disputed his claims of innocence. As Biden
considered his options as his term ended, former FBI Director
Christopher Wray sent the president a letter in which he called Peltier
“a remorseless killer” who should remain in prison. </p>
<p>In a statement about the commutation, Biden said numerous individuals
and groups supported releasing Peltier due to the time he spent in
prison, his age and his leadership role among Native Americans. </p>
<p>For decades, Peltier has maintained he was innocent of the murder
charges, and he said Wednesday: “I spent 49 years straight in prison for
something I didn’t do.” </p>
<p>Peltier said he went into prison a young man and emerged far older at
age 80. During all that time, Peltier said he tried to keep Native
American issues in the forefront of his activism, and he thanked tribes
across the nation for their decades of support. </p>
<p>“From day one, from the first hour I was arrested, Indian people came
to my rescue, from all over the country,” Peltier said. </p>
<p>Tribal leaders presented Peltier with an eagle feather staff that
supporters had carried to Washington and other places as they campaigned
for his release, and a traditional star quilt that Peltier draped over
his shoulder. </p>
<p>Nick Tilsen, an Oglala Lakota and founder of the NDN Collective, an
Indigenous-led advocacy group, paid tribute to Peltier and his
generation of American Indian Movement leaders for standing up “against
the most powerful government in the world. And they instilled that pride
back into our people. They instilled that fight back into our
people.” </p>
<p>“All around the world, Leonard Peltier’s name will be remembered as a
warrior, as a warrior who outlasted one of the strongest governments in
the world, and came out victorious.” </p>
<p>Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Tribal Chair Jamie Azure said the
welcome shown by hundreds of people at the event was a testament to what
he means to the tribe and other Native Americans. </p>
<p>“What I think you can see from the turnout here today, it means a lot
to a lot of people on a lot of different levels to see Mr. Peltier come
back to his homeland, to just be home,” Azure said. </p>
<p>As tribal member Denise Lajimodiere said, “It’s a big day. A day of
celebration.”</p>

Music Academy’s teen students mark 25th anniversary, Black History Month
with concert</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE — The Memphis music studio where some of America’s
most recognizable songs were recorded decades ago is now a museum. But
next door, trumpets blare, drums boom, and singers craft the soulful
sounds of Stax Records’ biggest hits.</p>
<p>At Stax Music Academy, young musicians rehearse the unmistakable
intro to “Theme from Shaft,” the Isaac Hayes tour de force that won an
Oscar in 1972 and tantalizes listeners with its pulsating bass line,
crisp hi-hat and funky guitar. There’s an air of professionalism among
the students as their teacher hands out sheets of music and words of
wisdom.</p>
<p>“Here we go. Read the ink that’s on the paper. From the top, one,
two, ready and …,” says Sam Franklin IV, the academy’s music director.
When they finish, Franklin says, “Hey y’all, that was good.”</p>
<p>Under the guidance of Franklin and other instructors, the students
are practicing for three concerts in Memphis, Tennessee, on Friday to
celebrate Black History Month and the academy’s 25th anniversary.
Created in 2000, the academy is an after-school program for teens that
teaches them to sing, dance and play instruments. Some pay nothing to
attend.</p>
<p>The academy has graduated more than 4,000 students since it started
in the working-class neighborhood of Soulsville, where Stax Records
produced soul and R&amp;B classics in the 1960s and 1970s. Since 2008,
every high school senior has been accepted to a college or university,
many on full scholarships. The academy has performed at the Rock and
Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, the Kennedy Center in Washington, and in
Europe and Australia.</p>
<p>Students take pride and joy in continuing the legacy of the
influential record company, where Otis Redding cut “(Sittin’ On) the
Dock of the Bay,” Sam and Dave worked on “Soul Man,” and The Staple
Singers made “Respect Yourself.” Other mainstays of the Stax catalog
include Booker T. and the MGs, Rufus and Carla Thomas, Wilson Pickett
and Johnnie Taylor.</p>
<p>Before it went bankrupt in 1975, Stax Records helped develop the raw,
emotional Memphis Sound, driven by tight horn and rhythm sections, and
strong-voiced singers. Some Stax songs were energetic and raucous,
others smooth and sexy. Stax Records no longer churns out chart-topping
music, although it still has a program for songwriters. The building has
been converted into the Stax Museum of American Soul Music.</p>
<p>The Stax Music Academy group practicing on a rainy January evening
includes both Black and white players. Before the work begins, some
students joke around and dance in the hallway outside the rehearsal
room, which boasts a high ceiling and a whiteboard with musical notes
written on it. In a separate room, vocalists clap for each other as they
take turns singing for their instructors.</p>
<p>“It’s so fun,” said Tatiyana Clark, a 17-year-old singer who joined
the academy in 2023. “I’ve been in places where we would have the same
interest in music, but nothing is like the connection that I have here.
Honestly, it’s a different level of friendship, when you have the exact
same feelings towards music, the same experiences — almost.”</p>
<p>Stax began online Black History Month presentations in 2021 during
the COVID-19 pandemic. Previous programs have included specific themes,
with this year’s being the U.S. labor movement and how it involved and
affected Black people, including work training, entrepreneurship and
unionization. But this year’s show is a series of in-person concerts at
a downtown Memphis venue where attendees will hear Sam and Dave’s “Hold
On, I’m Comin’”, Arthur Conley’s “Sweet Soul Music,” and “Cause I Love
You,” by the father and daughter duet of Rufus and Carla Thomas.</p>
<p>A companion study guide includes lessons and activities highlighting
key figures and events that shaped labor policies and standards.</p>
<p>“It’s all about the message for me,” said Johnathan Cole, an
18-year-old singer and songwriter. “It feels good because with the world
going crazy right now, everybody just needs a little bit of love,
happiness and music. That’s what Stax Music Academy has always been
about: love, music, creativity.”</p>
<p>When the labor and civil rights movements were striving for racial
equality and social justice, Booker T. and the MGs churned out “Green
Onions” and other toe-tapping instrumental songs, with Black men at
organ and drums — Booker T. Jones and Al Jackson Jr. — and white players
on lead and bass guitar — Steve Cropper and Donald “Duck” Dunn.</p>
<p>“I would describe Stax as ‘change,’” said Johnathan McKinnie, a
16-year-old piano and organ player. “It drastically changed how music
was formed … It was definitely an advocate for civil rights.”</p>
<p>In the vocalists’ rehearsal room, the group is perfecting Eddie
Floyd’s song about luck and love, “Knock on Wood.”</p>
<p>“It’s like thunder, and lightning, the way you love me is frightening
… better knock, knock, knock on wood,” three vocalists sing in
harmony.</p>
<p>“Breathe. You’re not breathing,’” one instructor tells a student, who
smiles and nods.</p>
<p>The exchange exemplifies the spirit of cooperation and dedication
that permeates the academy. Pasley Thompson, a 17-year-old singer and
songwriter, calls the academy “an escape from the every day.”</p>
<p>“Being able to be in a space with people that get you on a creative
level, and on a personal level, because we’re around each other all the
time, it’s a really great feeling to have,” she said.</p>

<h2 id="trump-vance-among-speakers-at-gathering-of-conservatives">Trump,
Vance among speakers at gathering of conservatives</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Conservative leaders, including U.S. President Donald Trump and
politicians from Argentina, Britain, Poland and Italy, are among those
set to address a three-day meeting of conservatives outside of
Washington beginning Thursday.</p>
<p>U.S. Vice President JD Vance leads off the Conservative Political
Action Conference, with other sessions Thursday set to include
discussions of cryptocurrency and Middle East peace, and a panel
featuring relatives of hostages being held in Gaza.</p>
<p>The CPAC conference helped Trump emerge as a figure in conservative
politics and one which he addressed every year during his prior term in
office.</p>
<p>He used an address last year at the conference to pledge that a
victory in the November presidential election would bring “judgment day”
for “the liars and cheaters and fraudsters and censors and imposters who
have commandeered our government.”</p>
<p>In addition to U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, Thursday’s agenda
also includes remarks from former British Prime Minister Liz Truss and
Balazs Orban, the political director for Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor
Orban.</p>
<p>Santiago Abascal, head of the far-right Spanish political party Vox
is set to address the event Thursday, as is British lawmaker Nigel
Farage and former Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.</p>
<p>Later conference speakers include Slovakian Prime Minister Robert
Fico, Argentina’s President Javier Milei and Italian Prime Minister
Giorgia Meloni.</p>

<h2
id="trump-says-he-has-not-seen-egyptian-counter-to-his-plan-for-gaza">Trump
says he has not seen Egyptian counter to his plan for Gaza</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump said Wednesday evening he
has not seen the proposal being discussed by Arab leaders as an
alternative to his plan to take over Gaza once the war between Hamas and
Israel ends.</p>
<p>“I haven’t seen it,” Trump said in response to a reporter’s question
on Air Force One. “Once I see it, I’ll let you know,” he added.</p>
<p>Trump said early this month he wants to forcibly relocate almost 2
million Palestinians from Gaza into neighboring Jordan and Egypt. He
said the United States will “own” the territory and turn it into the
“Riviera of the Middle East,” which prompted rejection by Arab
countries.</p>
<p>It’s unclear whether Trump is serious or merely threatening to
extract concessions from Arab states. During a meeting with Saudi Crown
Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh this week, U.S. Secretary of State
Marco Rubio suggested that it could be the latter, urging regional
leaders to make a counteroffer.</p>
<p>The Saudi crown prince will host leaders of Egypt, Jordan, and other
Gulf Cooperation Council states of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, and the
United Arab Emirates Friday in Riyadh to discuss options, including an
Egyptian plan to raise up to $20 billion over three years from Arab and
Gulf states for Gaza’s reconstruction. Under this plan, Gazans would not
be forced out and the strip would be governed by Palestinians.</p>
<p>Saudi connection</p>
<p>Trump spoke en route to Washington after delivering remarks at a
conference in Miami, hosted by the Future Investment Initiative
Institute, the nonprofit arm of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund –
the kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund led by the crown prince.</p>
<p>His speech marked the first time a U.S. president addressed the
annual gathering of global financiers and tech executives. It is a
testament to how the Saudi crown prince, known by his initials MBS, has
leveraged his connection to Trump, Laura Blumenfeld, senior fellow at
the Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies, said.</p>
<p>The prince established close ties during Trump’s first term and
continued business ties with the Trump organization while the president
was out of office, including investing $2 billion to a firm belonging to
Trump’s son-in-law and former aide, Jared Kushner.</p>
<p>“Trump believes in the Golden Rule, but not the Golden Rule from
Sunday school,” Blumenfeld told VOA. “It’s if you’re rich, you’re
right.”</p>
<p>As Riyadh leads the charge to unify Arab nations to support postwar
Gaza, there may be signs that Trump is softening his demand. In his
wide-ranging remarks that lasted over an hour, Trump did not mention
Gaza beyond repeating what he said was his role on the ceasefire signed
January 19, during the last day then-President Joe Biden was in
office.</p>
<p>“We’ve secured a ceasefire in Gaza, and we’re bringing in the
hostages, and we’re bringing them home to their families,” Trump said,
adding that some of the hostages “are in pretty bad shape.”</p>
<p>He lauded Yasir Al-Rumayyan, governor of the Saudi wealth fund, and
Saudi Finance Minister Mohammed bin Abdullah al-Jadaan. The White House
did not immediately respond to VOA’s query on whether Trump met with any
of the Saudi delegation during the event.</p>
<p>During his Wednesday remarks Trump thanked the Saudi crown prince for
hosting talks between U.S. and Russian officials Tuesday to find a way
to end the war in Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and
European allies have decried the meeting as an effort to sideline
Kyiv.</p>
<p>Egyptian proposal on Gaza</p>
<p>Egypt’s state-run Al-Ahram newspaper said under the proposal, “secure
areas” equipped with mobile houses and shelters will be established as
living areas in Gaza while Egyptian and international construction firms
rebuild the devastated infrastructure.</p>
<p>The proposal also calls for forming a national Palestinian committee
of technocrats and community leaders unaffiliated with Hamas to govern
postwar Gaza.</p>
<p>It is unclear whether the plan has the support of the Palestinian
Authority, the internationally recognized body that currently rules
parts of the West Bank and administered Gaza until it lost the 2006
election to Hamas.</p>
<p>“What is needed now is a political solution to Gaza to make that
reconstruction both physically possible and long term sustainable,” said
Tariq Kenney-Shawa, U.S. Policy Fellow at the Palestinian Policy Network
Al-Shabaka.</p>
<p>The goal is that “we don’t return to a situation where Gaza remains
under occupation,” he told VOA.</p>
<p>On Monday Hamas indicated a willingness to cede any postwar
governance role.</p>
<p>“It is not necessary for Hamas to be part of the political and
administrative arrangements in the next phase for Gaza, especially if it
serves the interests of our people,” Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qasim told
Al Arabiya TV.</p>
<p>Hamas made the conciliatory statement as negotiations toward phase
two of the ceasefire is set to begin in days, after weeks of delay.
However, it fulfils only part of Israel’s and the United States’ key
demand – the elimination of governance and military role for Hamas in
postwar Gaza.</p>
<p>So far Hamas has not shown it would disarm. Meanwhile Israel has not
defined what it considers an acceptable alternative governing entity to
Hamas and has rejected any involvement of the Palestinian Authority.</p>
<p>The Egyptian proposal also does not solve a longstanding issue
between the warring parties. Israeli leaders oppose any postwar plans
that would pave the way to a two-state solution, while a sovereign
Palestine remains a key requirement for Palestinians and Arab
countries.</p>
<p>Expedited hostage release</p>
<p>A top Hamas official announced earlier this week that the group will
return the remains of four deceased Israeli hostages and free six living
ones in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, including 47
senior Hamas members. Israel will also allow mobile homes and
construction equipment into Gaza.</p>
<p>The six living hostages are the last set to be freed under phase one
of the ceasefire that called for the gradual release of 33 hostages,
eight of whom are believed to be dead. Hamas took about 250 hostages and
killed about 1,200 people in the October 2023 attack on Israel.</p>
<p>Analysts said the expedited exchange of hostages and prisoners could
mean that both parties are anxious to secure what they can now, due to
concerns the truce will collapse before phase one expires next week.</p>
<p>“What we’re looking at now is possibly – possibly a swifter
resolution to phase two,” said Mirette Mabrouk, senior fellow at the
Middle East Institute.</p>
<p>“But if that happens, then that sort of signals near the end of the
conflict,” she told VOA. “And that’s something that [Israeli] Prime
Minister Netanyahu has said he’s not going to want without Hamas being
disarmed.”</p>
<p>Hamas is believed to be holding about 70 more captives, half of them
living. It insists it will only release them in exchange for a permanent
end to fighting and a full Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza.</p>
<p>Israel’s counteroffensive to the Hamas attack has displaced more than
2 million Palestinians and killed more than 48,200, mostly women and
children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. The Israeli military says
the death toll includes 17,000 militants.</p>

id="migrants-in-panama-deported-from-us-moved-to-darien-jungle-region">Migrants
in Panama deported from US moved to Darien jungle region</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PANAMA CITY — A group of migrants deported from the U.S. to Panama
last week were moved on Tuesday night from a hotel in the capital to the
Darien jungle region in the south of the country, a lawyer representing
a migrant family told Reuters on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Susana Sabalza, a Panamanian migration lawyer, said the family she
represents was transferred to Meteti, a town in the Darien, along with
other deported migrants.</p>
<p>La Estrella de Panama, a local daily, reported on Wednesday that 170
of the 299 migrants who had been in the hotel were moved to the
Darien.</p>
<p>Panama’s government did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>The 299 migrants have been staying at a hotel in Panama City under
the protection of local authorities and with the financial support of
the United States through the U.N.-related International Organization
for Migration and the U.N. refugee agency, according to the Panamanian
government.</p>
<p>The migrants include people from Afghanistan, China, India, Iran,
Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Turkey, Uzbekistan and Vietnam, according to
Panama’s president, Jose Raul Mulino, who has agreed with the U.S. to
receive non-Panamanian deportees.</p>
<p>The deportation of non-Panamanian migrants to Panama is part of the
Trump administration’s attempt to ramp up deportations of migrants
living in the U.S. illegally.</p>
<p>One of the challenges to Trump’s plan is that some migrants come from
countries that refuse to accept U.S. deportation flights, due to
strained diplomatic relations or other reasons. The arrangement with
Panama allows the U.S. to deport these nationalities and makes it
Panama’s responsibility to organize their onward repatriation.</p>
<p>The process has been criticized by human rights groups that worry
migrants could be mistreated and also fear for their safety if they are
ultimately returned to violent or war-torn countries of origin, such as
Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Sabalza said she had not been able to see her clients while they were
held at the hotel in Panama City and said she is seeking permission to
visit them at their new location. She declined to identify their
nationality, but said they were a Muslim family who “could be
decapitated” if they returned home.</p>
<p>Sabalza said the family would be requesting asylum in Panama or “any
country that will receive them other than their own.”</p>
<p>Mulino said previously the migrants would be moved to a shelter in
the Darien region, which includes the dense and lawless jungle
separating Central America from South America that has in recent years
become a corridor for hundreds of thousands of migrants aiming to reach
the United States.</p>
<p>Panama’s security minister said on Tuesday that more than half of the
migrants deported from the United States in recent days had accepted
voluntary repatriations to their home countries.</p>
<p>On Wednesday morning the hotel in Panama City where the migrants had
been held appeared quiet, according to a Reuters witness.</p>
<p>On Tuesday some migrants had been seen holding hands and looking out
a window of the hotel to get the attention of reporters outside.</p>
<p>Migrants in the hotel were not allowed to leave, according to media
reports.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Panama’s migration service said in a statement that a
Chinese national, Zheng Lijuan, had escaped from the hotel. It asked
that she return and accused unspecified people outside the hotel of
aiding her escape.</p>

id="senate-republicans-to-push-ahead-with-border-bill-despite-trump-opposition">Senate
Republicans to push ahead with border bill despite Trump opposition</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. Senate Republicans will push ahead on Thursday with
a measure to kickstart President Donald Trump’s agenda on immigration,
energy and defense, Majority Leader John Thune said on Wednesday, after
Trump called on them to drop the plan in favor of a sweeping resolution
prepared by House Republicans.</p>
<p>Trump came down firmly in favor of the House of Representatives’ plan
for one sweeping bill that would also include trillions of dollars in
tax cuts. House Republicans fear that the Senate’s “skinny” plan could
diminish their chances of extending Trump’s tax cuts later in their own
chamber, where the party holds a narrow and fractious 218-215
majority.</p>
<p>“We need both Chambers to pass the House Budget to ‘kickstart’ the
Reconciliation process, and move all of our priorities to the concept
of, ‘ONE BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL’,” the president wrote on social media on
Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>After a lunch meeting with Vice President JD Vance and his own Senate
Republicans, Thune told reporters that he would still go ahead with the
smaller bill.</p>
<p>“In the end, we’ll be able to, whether it’s one bill or two bills, to
get all the things that the president’s outlined – his objectives –
across the finish line,” said Thune, adding that he expected the Senate
to vote on its own blueprint on Thursday.</p>
<p>Some Republicans said they were confused about the plan to proceed
after Trump’s message.</p>
<p>“It seems a little strange to me,” Senator Josh Hawley said.</p>
<p>“If the president supports it and … I have some assurance of that,
I’ll support it,” the Missouri Republican added. “But it just seems a
little bizarre to me. I can’t quite figure out what we’re doing.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Democrats promised a long, drawn-out fight.</p>
<p>“Senate Democrats will expose Republicans’ reconciliation budget bill
exactly for what it is: a sinister front for clearing the way to cut
taxes for Donald Trump’s billionaire buddies,” Senate Democratic leader
Chuck Schumer of New York said.</p>
<p>The Senate measure, a $340 billion fiscal 2025 budget resolution,
would boost spending by $85 billion a year for four years to fund
tighter border security, Trump’s deportation of immigrants in the
country illegally, energy deregulation and an increase in military
spending. Republicans say the plan would offset the higher spending with
funding cuts in other areas.</p>
<p>The House budget resolution includes those same priorities along with
$4.5 trillion in tax cuts, while seeking to cover the cost through $2
trillion in spending cuts and accelerated economic growth based mainly
on the tax and energy policy changes it would usher in.</p>
<p>‘FULL agenda’</p>
<p>Both chambers of Congress need to pass the same budget resolution to
unlock the parliamentary tool that would enable Republicans to enact
Trump’s legislative agenda in a way that circumvents Democratic
opposition and the Senate filibuster.</p>
<p>Republican lawmakers in recent weeks have backed away from concerns
that extending Trump’s 2017 tax cuts could add to the nation’s
fast-growing $36 trillion in debt. The nonpartisan Committee for a
Responsible Federal Budget estimated that Trump’s full tax cut agenda
could cost more than $5 trillion over the next decade.</p>
<p>House Republicans welcomed Trump’s intervention as they try to forge
unity for a floor vote on their own budget blueprint expected next
week.</p>
<p>“<span class="citation"
data-cites="realDonaldTrump">@realDonaldTrump</span> is right! House
Republicans are working to deliver President Trump’s FULL agenda - not
just a small part of it. Let’s get it done, <span class="citation"
data-cites="HouseGOP">@HouseGOP</span>!” tweeted House Speaker Mike
Johnson, Thune’s Republican counterpart.</p>
<p>The difference between the House and Senate strategies comes down to
Trump’s proposed tax cuts.</p>
<p>House Republicans fear the two-step Senate approach could lead to a
stalled standalone tax cut bill if lawmakers cannot agree on offsetting
cuts in spending. Senate Republicans worry that the rush for
all-encompassing legislation may not provide enough time to adequately
handle the intricacies of the tax component.</p>
<p>Senate Republicans began moving forward with their own budget
resolution last week in response to what they described as a plea for
border and immigration funding from Trump “border czar” Tom Homan and
White House budget director Russ Vought.</p>

id="trumps-comments-on-ukraine-draw-mixed-reaction-from-us-lawmakers">Trump’s
comments on Ukraine draw mixed reaction from US lawmakers</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President Donald Trump’s comments this week claiming Ukraine was
responsible for starting the three-year conflict with Russia and calling
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy “a dictator without elections”
drew criticism from congressional Democrats and pushback from some
members of the Republican Party.</p>
<p>“Clearly, Vladimir Putin is responsible for this war,” Republican
Senator Thom Tillis told reporters. “His decision has resulted in the
murder, rape, torture and kidnapping of untold numbers of Ukrainians. He
owns responsibility for this war. I don’t know how more plainly it can
be stated.”</p>
<p>Republican Senator John Kennedy told reporters he believes Russia
started the war.</p>
<p>“I also believe, through bitter experience, that Vladimir Putin is a
gangster. He’s a gangster with a black heart,” he added.</p>
<p>But Senate Majority Leader John Thune declined to criticize Trump
when speaking to reporters Wednesday.</p>
<p>“The president speaks for himself,” Thune said. “What I want to see
is a peaceful result, a peaceful outcome. And I think right now, there’s
a negotiation going on, and let’s see where that ultimately leads.”</p>
<p>Republican Senator Josh Hawley said Trump has blamed Russia “as well,
and threatened to sanction Russia if they didn’t come to the negotiating
table.”</p>
<p>The conflict between Trump and Zelenskyy comes as U.S. envoy Keith
Kellogg arrived in Kyiv on Wednesday to meet with Zelenskyy.</p>
<p>Ukraine was not included in peace talks that began this week in
Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, between the United States and Russia. Trump
brushed off Ukraine’s complaints at not being included in negotiations,
saying Tuesday, “You never should have started it.”</p>
<p>Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, claiming eastern parts of
the country needed to be liberated. U.S. officials say nearly half a
million Ukrainian civilians have died in the war and at least 124,000
Ukrainian soldiers.</p>
<p>After Trump’s comment, seeming to blame the Ukrainian leader for
starting the war, Zelenskyy responded on social media that Trump lives
in a “disinformation space” influenced by Russia.</p>
<p>Trump responded to Zelenskyy on Truth Social on Wednesday: “Think of
it, a modestly successful comedian, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, talked the
United States of America into spending $350 Billion Dollars, to go into
a War that couldn’t be won, that never had to start, but a War that he,
without the U.S. and ‘TRUMP,’ will never be able to settle. A Dictator
without Elections, Zelenskyy better move fast or he is not going to have
a Country left.”</p>
<p>Hawley told reporters Wednesday that he supported Trump’s calls for
an election in Ukraine.</p>
<p>“The suspension of elections in Ukraine is a bad deal,” Hawley said.
“Zelenskyy should hold elections. He’s the elected leader of the
country. Our president is right — they haven’t had elections in a long
time, and they are basically under martial law. That’s not good when you
claim to be defending democracy. You need to practice it.”</p>
<p>But Democrats said Trump’s comments endanger America’s standing on
the global stage.</p>
<p>“This is outrageous. It’s outrageous if not humorous that the
president does these sorts of things, goes off on wild tangents and says
things that are clearly false,” Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin told
reporters.</p>
<p>Democratic Senator Elissa Slotkin said Wednesday, “It is what we all
feared, which is he understands incorrectly what’s happening in the span
of history and is blaming the head of a country that has been invaded by
an autocratic regime; a democracy was invaded.</p>
<p>“And however you want to solve it, however you want to negotiate, is
one thing,” Slotkin said. “But he put down his cards.”</p>

<h2 id="us-figures-do-not-support-trump-claims-on-ukraine-spending">US
figures do not support Trump claims on Ukraine spending</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>President Donald Trump on Wednesday repeated a claim that the United
States has spent $350 billion on Ukraine’s war — a figure that far
eclipses the amount recorded by the Department of Defense and the
interagency oversight group that tracks U.S. appropriations to
Ukraine.</p>
<p>Since Russia’s illegal invasion in February 2022, the U.S. Congress
has appropriated about $183 billion for Ukraine, according to the
interagency oversight group that is charged with presenting reports to
Congress.</p>
<p>Of that, the Pentagon confirmed to VOA that the U.S. has sent $65.9
billion in military aid to Ukraine, and an additional $3.9 billion that
Congress has authorized in military aid to Kyiv remains unspent.</p>
<p>About $58 billion of the $183 billion in total aid for Ukraine was
spent in the U.S., going directly toward boosting the U.S. defense
industry, either by replacing old U.S. weapons given to Kyiv with new
American-made weapons, by procuring new U.S.-made weapons for Kyiv or by
making direct industrial investments.</p>
<p>VOA asked the White House to clarify Trump’s comments, specifically
seeking any documentation for the mathematical discrepancy. The White
House replied by referring VOA back to the president’s comments.</p>
<p>In a post Wednesday on his social media site Truth Social, Trump
said, “Think of it, a modestly successful comedian, Volodymyr Zelenskyy,
talked the United States of America into spending $350 Billion Dollars,
to go into a War that couldn’t be won, that never had to start, but a
War that he, without the U.S. and ‘TRUMP,’ will never be able to
settle.”</p>
<p>Zelenskyy on Wednesday told Ukrainian reporters the total cost of the
war since February 2022 was about $320 billion.</p>
<p>“One hundred and twenty billion of that comes from us, the people of
Ukraine, the taxpayers, and $200 billion from the United States and the
European Union,” Zelensky said. “This is the cost of weapons. This is
the weapons package — $320 billion.”</p>
<p>Trump, who has mentioned the $350 billion figure several times, also
said in his Wednesday social media post: “The United States has spent
$200 Billion Dollars more than Europe, and Europe’s money is guaranteed,
while the United States will get nothing back.”</p>
<p>The Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a Germany-based nonprofit
that tracks military, financial and humanitarian support to Ukraine,
says European nations —specifically the EU, United Kingdom, Iceland,
Norway and Switzerland — have allocated about $140 billion in total in
aid for Ukraine, while the United States has allocated about $120
billion in total aid. Total aid includes military, humanitarian and
financial aid to Ukraine.</p>
<p>The U.S. has provided about $2 billion more than Europe in military
aid for Ukraine, but “European donors have been the main source of
[total] aid to Ukraine since 2022, especially when it comes to financial
and humanitarian aid,” the institute said in its latest report last
week.</p>
<p>The aid to Ukraine constitutes a very small amount of GDP for several
nations. For example, the U.S., Germany and the U.K. have mobilized less
than 0.2% of their GDP per year to support Kyiv, while contributions
from France, Italy and Spain to Ukraine have amounted to about 0.1% of
their annual GDP. </p>
<p>U.S. government math is complex, and spending is massive in scale. A
live tracker of U.S. government spending says that the U.S. government
has spent about $2.4 trillion in the early part of the 2025 fiscal year.
The previous year’s spending was $6.75 trillion. </p>
<p>Still, scholars were quick to dismiss the accuracy of Trump’s
numbers.</p>
<p>“This figure is not true,” said Liana Fix, fellow for Europe at the
Council on Foreign Relations. “It’s possible to track how much the
United States has spent for Ukraine.”</p>

chief eyes funding cuts to some parts of military by 8%</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has asked some parts
of the military to propose what could be cut as part of a potential 8%
spending reduction for them over each of the next five years, U.S.
officials said on Wednesday, although it was unclear if the total
defense budget would shrink.</p>
<p>In a memo described to Reuters by U.S. officials, Hegseth called for
the proposals by Feb. 24.</p>
<p>Officials said it did not appear that Hegseth wanted a major budget
cut but was looking to reprioritize funding to better align with
President Donald Trump’s national security priorities.</p>
<p>There was a long list of exemptions, including U.S. Indo-Pacific
Command, funding for the military’s mission along the U.S. border with
Mexico, as well as missile defense and autonomous weapons, one of the
officials said.</p>
<p>The military’s commands that oversee operations in Europe, the Middle
East and Africa were not exempt.</p>
<p>The Pentagon’s budget is approaching $1 trillion per year. In
December, former President Joe Biden signed a bill authorizing $895
billion in defense spending for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30.</p>
<p>Hegseth has said publicly that the Pentagon’s focus is on U.S. border
security and threats posed by China. He has said the U.S. can no longer
be “primarily focused on the security of Europe.”</p>
<p>Pentagon employees have braced for firings after businessman Elon
Musk’s government downsizing teams started working out of the
Pentagon.</p>
<p>Some civilian employees in the military said they had started
receiving emails on Thursday saying they could be separated from the
government since they were hired less than a year ago.</p>
<p>Leaders from across the political spectrum have long criticized waste
and inefficiency at the Defense Department.</p>
<p>But Democrats and civil service unions have said Musk, the world’s
richest person, lacks the expertise to restructure the Pentagon, and the
efforts of his team risk exposing classified programs.</p>
<p>Attempting to cancel defense programs could trigger pushback from
lawmakers to defend spending in their electoral districts, a fact
defense contractors are well aware of.</p>
<p>The F-35, for example, has suppliers located in all 50 U.S. states, a
point Lockheed makes with a map on its website detailing the economic
value derived from production of the fighter jets.</p>
<p>Musk, himself a major U.S. defense contractor, has a particular
disdain for certain defense projects, especially the F-35. He has posted
on X that “Some U.S. weapons systems are good, albeit overpriced, but
please, in the name of all that is holy, let us stop the worst military
value for money in history that is the F-35 program!”</p>

Army Corps seeks to fast-track 600 ‘emergency’ projects through
environmental review</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has identified over 600
energy and other infrastructure projects that could be fast-tracked
under President Donald Trump’s National Energy Emergency declaration,
according to data posted on its website. </p>
<p>Among the projects on the list were Enbridge’s Line 5 oil pipeline
under Lake Michigan, several natural gas power plants, and liquefied
natural gas export terminals proposed by Cheniere and Venture
Global. </p>
<p>The Army Corps posted the list, without sending a public notice, last
week, marking the projects as eligible for emergency permitting
treatment. </p>
<p>Trump had ordered the Army Corps to issue permits enabling the
filling of wetlands and dredging or building in waterways as part of the
“National Energy Emergency” he declared in a day-one executive
order. </p>
<p>The Army Corps was not immediately available for comment. </p>
<p>The fast-tracking of these projects could trigger legal fights over
many of the permits that will be issued, with environmental groups
warning they are flouting federal laws. </p>
<p>“This end-run around the normal environmental review process is not
only harmful for our waters but is illegal under the Corps’ own
emergency permitting regulations,” said David Bookbinder, director of
Law and Policy at The Environmental Integrity Project.</p>
<p>Courts may be unwilling to weigh in on the president’s criteria for
what constitutes a national energy emergency but will more likely weigh
how individual projects adhere to the language of the executive order,
he said. </p>
<p>Companies with projects awaiting key permits applauded the move to
“streamline” the review process. </p>
<p>“Line 5 is critical energy infrastructure,” said Enbridge
spokesperson Gina Sutherland, saying the company has been awaiting a
permit for building a Great Lakes Tunnel under Lake Michigan for nearly
five years. </p>
<p>“We are very encouraged to see this action to expedite review for
responsible critical mineral development projects,” said Jon Cherry, CEO
of Perpetua Resources, which is developing a U.S. antimony and gold mine
in Idaho with financial support from the Pentagon and U.S. Export-Import
Bank. </p>
<p>The Biden administration had issued the mine a permit, but it still
needs a wetlands permit, which Cherry said he expects to receive by
July. </p>
<p>The Army Corps has in the past issued emergency designations to skip
over environmental reviews in cases in which the project addressed poses
a threat to human life. </p>
<p>Environmental and watchdog groups say that most of the projects
marked as emergencies on the list do not meet the Army Corps’ definition
of an emergency. They also question the Trump administration’s
justification for declaring a national energy emergency.  </p>
<p>“It is laughable to see Line 5 on this list,” said Debbie Chizewer,
managing attorney for the Midwestern office of Earthjustice, which
represents the Bay Mills Indian Community in opposition of the project.
“It’s a pipeline that carries crude oil from Canada to Canada and will
not increase U.S. capacity or respond to Trump’s declared energy
emergency.” </p>
<p>Other projects do not relate to energy production, including a
home-building project built on land owned by oil giant Chevron in
California, as well as an aerial electrical distribution line to private
waterfront residences in Alabama. </p>
<p>There are at least five dozen solar energy projects on the list.
Solar and wind energy were excluded from the definition of energy in
Trump’s energy emergency order. </p>
<p>West Virginia has the largest number of projects on the list at 141.
There are 60 in Pennsylvania, 57 in Texas, 42 in Florida, and 41 in
Ohio, according to the Environmental Integrity Project, which is
tracking the permits. </p>
<p>Officials at Venture Global and Cheniere were not immediately
available to comment.</p>

judge delays ruling on federal request to drop case against New York
City mayor</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — New York City Mayor Eric Adams told a federal judge
Wednesday that he is innocent and doesn’t fear corruption charges could
be refiled if a Justice Department request to dismiss them is
granted. </p>
<p>Judge Dale E. Ho ended the hearing by saying he wouldn’t rule
immediately but he was aware that “it’s not in anyone’s interest here
for this to drag on.” </p>
<p>During the hearing, Ho asked the mayor questions to ensure he
understood that if the charges were dropped, they could later be
reinstated. </p>
<p>“I have not committed a crime,” Adams said. “I’m not afraid of
that.” </p>
<p>Deputy U.S. Attorney General Emil Bove said the request to drop the
corruption charges against the mayor resulted from “a straightforward
exercise in prosecutorial discretion guided” by President Donald Trump’s
executive order on weaponization of the justice system and Attorney
General Pam Bondi’s memorandum outlining the same. </p>
<p>Bove said he believed the request to drop charges, when tied to
Trump’s order and Bondi’s conclusions, made it “virtually unreviewable
in this courtroom.” </p>
<p>Bove said he also believed “the continuation of this prosecution is
interfering with both national security and immigration enforcement
initiatives being carried out by the executive branch.” </p>
<p>Ho scheduled the hearing after three Trump administration lawyers,
including Bove, made the dismissal request on Friday. Manhattan’s top
federal prosecutor resigned after she refused an order to do so. </p>
<p>An indictment charges the first-term Democrat with accepting more
than $100,000 in illegal campaign contributions and lavish travel perks
from a Turkish official and business leaders seeking to buy Adams’
influence while he was Brooklyn borough president. Adams has pleaded not
guilty. He faces multiple challengers in the Democratic primary in
June. </p>
<p>Closely watching the judicial proceedings is Democratic Governor
Kathy Hochul, who is considering whether to remove Adams from office
amid concerns that he reached a deal to have the case dropped in
exchange for the mayor’s political fealty to Trump. </p>
<p>Early last week, Bove told prosecutors in New York to drop the
charges because the prosecution “has unduly restricted Mayor Adams’
ability to devote full attention and resources to the illegal
immigration and violent crime.” Bove said charges could be reinstated
after November’s mayoral election. </p>
<p>Two days later, then-interim U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon told
Bondi in a letter that dismissing the charges in return for Adams’
assistance in enforcing federal immigration laws would betray Bondi’s
own words that she “will not tolerate abuses of the criminal justice
process, coercive behavior, or other forms of misconduct.” </p>
<p>“Dismissal of the indictment for no other reason than to influence
Adams’s mayoral decision-making would be all three,” said Sassoon, a
Republican. She said it amounted to a “quid pro quo” deal and disclosed
that prosecutors were about to bring additional obstruction of justice
charges against Adams. </p>
<p>Bove, in accepting Sassoon’s resignation, accused her of “pursuing a
politically motivated prosecution despite an express instruction to
dismiss the case.” He informed her that two other prosecutors assigned
to the case were being suspended with pay and that an investigation
would determine if they would keep their jobs. </p>
<p>One prosecutor, Hagan Scotten, quit the following day. In all, seven
prosecutors, including five high-ranking prosecutors at the Justice
Department, had resigned by Friday.</p>

id="wto-holds-constructive-talks-after-china-condemns-trump-tariffs">WTO
holds ‘constructive’ talks after China condemns Trump tariffs</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>GENEVA — The World Trade Organization said on Wednesday that
discussions on trade tensions were “constructive,” after China accused
the United States of imposing “tariff shocks” that could upend the
global trading system.</p>
<p>China condemned tariffs launched or threatened by U.S. President
Donald Trump at a WTO meeting on Tuesday. Washington dismissed China’s
comments as hypocritical.</p>
<p>Trump has announced sweeping 10% tariffs on all Chinese imports,
prompting Beijing to respond with retaliatory tariffs and to file a WTO
dispute against Washington in what could be an early test of Trump’s
stance towards the institution.</p>
<p>The majority of the six countries that participated in the talks on
trade turbulence, put on the agenda by China, raised concern about
mounting tensions, but also called for restraint, said WTO spokesperson
Ismaila Dieng in a press conference in Geneva on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The United States, Nicaragua, Namibia, Malaysia, Trinidad and Tobago,
and Russia took part in the discussions, which were part of broader
talks on trade.</p>
<p>The large majority “stressed the importance of upholding WTO
principles and values and called for action to preserve the stability
and effectiveness of the global trading system,” Dieng added.</p>
<p>Two trade sources at the meeting told Reuters that some countries
expressed deep concern about the ramifications of tariffs, while others
criticized China for alleged market distortions.</p>
<p>It is the first time that mounting trade frictions were formally
addressed on the agenda of the watchdog’s top decision-making body, the
General Council.</p>
<p>‘Tariff shocks’</p>
<p>“These ‘tariff shocks’ heighten economic uncertainty, disrupt global
trade, and risk domestic inflation, market distortion, or even global
recession,” China’s ambassador to the WTO, Li Chenggang, said at a
closed-door meeting of the global trade body on Tuesday, according to a
statement sent to Reuters.</p>
<p>“Worse, the U.S. unilateralism threatens to upend the rules-based
multilateral trading system.”</p>
<p>U.S. envoy David Bisbee called China’s economy a “predatory
non-market economic system” in response and accused it of violating and
evading WTO rules.</p>
<p>Negotiating tactic</p>
<p>Some delegates said they saw China’s intervention as an attempt to
show itself supporting WTO rules — a posture that can help China win
allies in ongoing global trade negotiations.</p>
<p>Disputes between the two top economies at the WTO long pre-date
Trump’s arrival. Beijing has accused Washington of breaking rules while
Washington says Beijing does not deserve its “developing country” status
at the WTO.</p>
<p>The Trump administration has announced plans to withdraw or disengage
from other global organizations, but the WTO has not yet been a major
focus for the White House.</p>
<p>However, incoming U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer has called
the WTO “deeply flawed.”</p>

id="europe-frozen-out-of-peace-talks-as-russias-war-on-ukraine-enters-fourth-year">Europe
frozen out of peace talks as Russia’s war on Ukraine enters fourth
year</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LONDON — Russia’s tanks rolled across the Ukrainian border three
years ago this month, triggering the worst conflict on European soil
since World War II. Ukraine has resisted the full-scale invasion largely
thanks to the support of the United States and Europe. </p>
<p>But on the frozen front lines, the war grinds on — and Russia’s
forces are slowly edging forward.  </p>
<p>“Every day, it pushes back the Ukrainian front line somewhere by a
kilometer or so. My judgment is that it could continue to do that over
the rest of this year,” said Ben Barry, senior fellow for land warfare
at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. </p>
<p>“We must remember this is a terrible war. My judgment is that over a
million people have been killed or seriously wounded. Now the balance of
casualties is probably in Ukraine’s favor. A figure of 700,000 or
800,000 Russian casualties seems credible to me. President [Volodymyr]
Zelenskyy says Ukraine has only suffered 48,000 killed. That seems
implausibly low to me,” Barry told Agence France-Presse. </p>
<p>Europe excluded </p>
<p>As the war enters its fourth year, Europe and Ukraine fear they are
being excluded from deciding their own fate. Behind the scenes, the
geopolitical forces that are shaping the conflict appear to be changing
fast.  </p>
<p>Russia and the United States began peace talks this week in Saudi
Arabia. Ukraine and Europe were not invited.  </p>
<p>“There will be some very significant alarm in European capitals about
what might be discussed with regards to the security of their continent,
their whole region,” said David Blagden, associate professor of
international security at the University of Exeter. </p>
<p>“One sort of potentially really bad outcome for European capitals is
to discover that the Americans have basically put them on the hook for
attempting to do some sort of peacekeeping mission in Ukraine or
whatever without their say-so,” he told Reuters.  </p>
<p>Peacekeepers </p>
<p>Britain and France have already said they may be willing to
contribute to a peacekeeping force in Ukraine, a requirement of an
estimated 100,000 troops.  </p>
<p>There are deep concerns over the potential risks of sending
peacekeeping troops, according to Armida van Rij, head of the Europe
program at London’s Chatham House. </p>
<p>“The U.S. seemed to have taken away NATO’s Article 5 protection [on
collective self-defense] for any troops that would be put in Ukraine.
That means that they would not be protected, so that deterrent effect is
gone. We know that Russia tends to break agreements. It has a long
history of doing that under [President Vladimir] Putin and previous
presidents. So, it is quite likely that Russia may well break the terms
of any ceasefire or peace agreement that may come …  and then the
question is, ‘OK, so what do the Europeans then do in response?’ That
might put them in direct confrontation with Russia, which is a
terrifying thought,” van Rij told VOA. </p>
<p>Defense spending </p>
<p>The European Union says it has provided around $145 billion in
military, financial, humanitarian and refugee aid to Ukraine over the
past three years, more than half the total global assistance for
Kyiv. </p>
<p>U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said this month that European
security will no longer be a priority, and Washington is demanding NATO
allies increase their defense spending. </p>
<p>“Where that money’s going to come from is a key question,” said van
Rij. “The European Commission seems open to allowing some flexibility to
their fiscal rules, which will make it a little bit easier for countries
to spend on defense. But all of that still takes time, so it’s still
going to be really difficult.” </p>
<p>Hard decisions will have profound implications for Europe, according
to British Defense Secretary John Healey.  </p>
<p>“The decisions that we make right now over the coming weeks will not
only define the outcome of the conflict in Ukraine, but the security of
our world for a generation to come,” Healey said in a speech Tuesday in
London.</p>

<h2 id="us-envoy-in-ukraine-for-talks-following-us-russia-meeting">US
envoy in Ukraine for talks following US-Russia meeting</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President Donald Trump’s envoy for Ukraine and Russia said
Wednesday the United States understands the needs for security
guarantees for Ukraine, as he visited the country for talks with
Ukrainian officials.</p>
<p>Gen. Keith Kellogg told reporters in Kyiv that he was in Ukraine “to
listen,” hear the concerns of Ukrainian leaders and return to the United
States to consult President Trump.</p>
<p>Kellogg said the United States wants the war in Ukraine to end,
saying that would be good for the region and the world.</p>
<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told reporters ahead of an
expected meeting with Kellogg that while U.S. officials have said there
will be no U.S. troops deployed as part of any potential post-war
peacekeeping mission, there are still other ways it can help, such as
providing air defense systems.</p>
<p>“You don’t want boots on the ground, you don’t want NATO,” Zelenskyy
said. “Okay, can we have Patriots? Enough Patriots?”</p>
<p>The discussions in Kyiv come amid a flurry of diplomatic efforts
focused on Russia’s war in Ukraine, including French President Emmanuel
Macron hosting European leaders Wednesday for a second round of talks
about the conflict and European support for Ukraine.</p>
<p>Kellogg also met earlier this week with European leaders, and on
Tuesday U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio held talks with Russian
Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Rubio said both Ukraine and Russia would have to make concessions to
achieve peace.</p>
<p>“The goal is to bring an end to this conflict in a way that’s fair,
enduring, sustainable and acceptable to all parties involved,” Rubio
told reporters. No Ukrainian or European officials were at the table for
the talks.</p>
<p>Zelenskyy objected to being excluded from the meeting, a position
that drew criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>“Today I heard, ‘Well, we weren’t invited.’ Well, you’ve been there
for three years,” Trump said of Ukraine’s leaders. “You should have
never started it.”</p>
<p>Russia began the war with its February 2022 full-scale invasion of
Ukraine.</p>
<p>Zelenskyy added Wednesday that while he has “great respect” for
Trump, the American leader is living in a Russian-made “disinformation
space.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Zelenskyy postponed a trip to Saudi Arabia that had been scheduled
for this week, suggesting that he wanted to avoid his visit being linked
to the U.S.-Russia negotiations.</p>
<p>The United States and Russia agreed to “appoint respective high-level
teams to begin working on a path to ending the conflict in Ukraine as
soon as possible,” State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said in a
statement. Bruce characterized the meeting as “an important step
forward” toward peace.</p>
<p>Rubio said Ukraine and European nations would have to be involved in
talks on ending the war. He said that if the war is halted, the United
States would have “extraordinary opportunities … to partner” with Russia
on trade and other global issues.</p>
<p>European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said she and other
European foreign ministers spoke to Rubio after the U.S.-Russia meeting,
and she expressed support for a Ukraine-led resolution.</p>
<p>“Russia will try to divide us. Let’s not walk into their traps,”
Kallas said on X. “By working together with the US, we can achieve a
just and lasting peace — on Ukraine’s terms.”</p>
<p>Russia now controls about one-fifth of Ukraine’s internationally
recognized 2014 territory, including the Crimean Peninsula that it
unilaterally annexed in 2014, a large portion of eastern Ukraine that
pro-Russian separatists captured in subsequent fighting, and land Russia
has taken over since the 2022 invasion.</p>
<p>As the invasion started, Moscow hoped for a quick takeover of all of
Ukraine. But with stiff Ukrainian resistance, the war instead evolved
into a grinding ground conflict and daily aerial bombardments by each
side.</p>
<p>Zelenskyy has long demanded that his country’s 2014 boundaries be
restored, but U.S. officials have said that is unrealistic, as is Kyiv’s
long-sought goal of joining NATO.</p>

<p>date: 2025-02-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>United Arab Emirates President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan
told U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio that the UAE rejects “any
attempts to displace the Palestinian people from their land” as Rubio
made a visit Wednesday to Abu Dhabi.</p>
<p>UAE state media reported the comments and said the president
highlighted the need to prevent an expansion of the conflict in
Gaza.</p>
<p>“He also underscored the importance of linking Gaza’s reconstruction
to a path that leads to a comprehensive and lasting peace based on the
two-state solution, as the only manner of ensuring stability in the
region,” the report said.</p>
<p>Arab leaders have rejected plans suggested by U.S. President Donald
Trump that Palestinians leave Gaza for other countries in the region,
and that the U.S. take over and rebuild the Palestinian enclave.</p>
<p>Rubio’s visit was part of a multi-nation tour that also included
talks with leaders in Israel and in Saudi Arabia, which came as the
first phase of a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip
moved into its final weeks.</p>
<p>Hostage release</p>
<p>A top Hamas leader said Tuesday that the militant group plans to
release six more living Israeli hostages from their Gaza captivity on
Saturday and the bodies of four others on Thursday.</p>
<p>Hamas leader Khalil al-Hayya made the surprise announcement in a
recorded statement, an apparent response to the Israeli decision to
allow long-requested mobile homes and construction equipment into the
Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>The six living hostages are the last set to be freed under the first
phase of the ceasefire that expires in early March, with Hamas believed
to be holding about 70 more captives, half of them living. Four more
bodies of hostages are set to be returned next week.</p>
<p>So far during the ceasefire, Hamas has released 24 hostages, and
Israel freed more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners.</p>
<p>The warring sides have yet to negotiate the second and more difficult
phase of their truce, in which Hamas says it will only release the
remaining hostages in exchange for a lasting halt to the fighting and a
full Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Israel has not backed off its goal, supported by the
United States, of eradicating any military or governing role for Hamas
in Gaza.</p>
<p>Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said Tuesday that Israel was
ready to open negotiations on the details of the second phase. Those
talks were supposed to have started two weeks ago, according to the
ceasefire deal.</p>
<p>In his remarks, Hayya said the “Bibas family” would be included in
the handover of the four bodies, apparently referring to Shiri Bibas and
her two young sons, Ariel and Kfir, who for many Israelis embody the
captives’ plight.</p>
<p>Israel has not confirmed their deaths, and Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu’s office urged the public not to distribute “photos, names and
rumors.” Israel has said it was gravely concerned about the Bibas
family, while Hamas said they were killed in an Israeli airstrike early
in the war. Yarden Bibas, the husband and father, was kidnapped
separately and released this month.</p>
<p>Kfir, who was 9 months old at the time, was the youngest hostage
taken in Hamas’ October 7, 2023, attack on Israel that triggered 15
months of fighting. Video footage of the abduction showed Shiri
swaddling her redheaded boys in a blanket and being whisked away by
armed men.</p>
<p>“In recent hours we have been shaken after the Hamas spokesman’s
announcement was published about the return of our Shiri, Ariel and Kfir
this coming Thursday as part of the movement to release kidnapped
civilians,” the family said in a statement. “It is important for us to
say that we are aware of the reports but have not yet received an
official update on the matter.”</p>
<p>“Until we receive certainty, our journey will not end,” the family
said.</p>
<p>An Israeli official said Netanyahu had agreed to allow the mobile
homes and construction equipment into Gaza to accelerate the hostages’
release. Hamas last week threatened to hold up the release of more
hostages, citing the mobile home issue and other alleged violations of
the truce.</p>
<p>Israel is expected to continue releasing hundreds of Palestinian
prisoners, including many serving life sentences for deadly attacks, in
exchange for the hostages.</p>
<p>Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group, killed about 1,200 people in
the October 2023 attack and took about 250 as hostages. More than half
the captives have been released in ceasefire agreements and other deals,
while eight were rescued in military operations.</p>
<p>Israel’s air and ground war killed more than 48,200 Palestinians,
mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which
does not say how many were combatants. The Israeli military says the
death toll includes 17,000 militants. The offensive destroyed vast areas
of Gaza and displaced most of its population of 2.3 million.</p>

condemns ‘dangerous’ maneuvers by Chinese navy in South China Sea</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MANILA, Philippines — The United States condemned the “dangerous”
maneuvers of a Chinese navy helicopter that endangered the safety of a
Philippine government aircraft patrolling a disputed shoal in the South
China Sea, its ambassador to Manila said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>In a post on X, Ambassador MaryKay Carlson also called on China “to
refrain from coercive actions and settle its disputes peacefully in
accordance with international law.”</p>
<p>The Philippines said late on Tuesday it was “deeply disturbed” by the
Chinese navy’s “unprofessional and reckless” flight actions and that it
will make a diplomatic protest.</p>
<p>Manila’s coast guard said the Chinese navy helicopter performed
dangerous flight maneuvers when it flew close to a government aircraft
conducting surveillance over the Scarborough Shoal, endangering the
lives of its pilots and passengers.</p>
<p>China disputed the Philippines’ account, saying on Tuesday its
aircraft “illegally intruded” into China’s airspace and accused its
Southeast Asian neighbor of “spreading false narratives.”</p>
<p>Named after a British ship that was grounded on the atoll nearly
three centuries ago, the Scarborough Shoal is one of the most contested
maritime features in the South China Sea, where Beijing and Manila have
clashed repeatedly.</p>
<p>“The Philippines has undeniable sovereignty and jurisdiction over
Bajo de Masinloc,” its maritime council said in a statement, using
Manila’s name for the shoal.</p>
<p>China claims sovereignty over almost the entire South China Sea, a
vital waterway for more than $3 trillion of annual ship-borne commerce,
putting it at odds with Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and
Vietnam.</p>
<p>A 2016 arbitration ruling invalidated China’s expansive claims but
Beijing does not recognize the decision.</p>

<h2 id="senate-advances-nomination-of-trump-fbi-pick-kash-patel">Senate
advances nomination of Trump FBI pick Kash Patel</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate on Tuesday voted to advance the
nomination of Kash Patel to be the director of the FBI, putting a
staunch ally of President Donald Trump and a critic of the bureau on
track to run the most prominent U.S. law enforcement agency.</p>
<p>The Senate voted 48-45 along party lines on a procedural measure
setting the stage for a final confirmation vote on one of Trump’s most
controversial nominees later this week.</p>
<p>Patel, a former intelligence and Defense Department official in
Trump’s first term, has called for a radical reshaping of the FBI,
pledging to expand its role on illegal immigration and violent crime,
core Trump priorities.</p>
<p>Patel has been among the most vocal critics of FBI investigations
into Trump on issues ranging from Russian interference in the 2016
election, Trump’s retention of classified documents at his Florida club
and his attempts to overturn the 2020 election.</p>
<p>Democrats have called Patel unfit to lead the FBI, pointing to his
embrace of false claims about voter fraud in the 2020 election and FBI
agents fomenting the January 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol. But
Patel has attracted broad support from Republicans, who have touted him
as a reformer.</p>
<p>A Senate panel voted 12-10 along party lines last week to send his
nomination to the full Senate.</p>

<h2 id="senate-confirms-howard-lutnick-as-commerce-secretary">Senate
confirms Howard Lutnick as commerce secretary</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The Senate confirmed wealthy financier Howard Lutnick as
commerce secretary Tuesday, putting in place a staunch supporter of
President Donald Trump’s hardline trade policies.</p>
<p>At the Commerce Department, Lutnick, who was CEO at the investment
firm Cantor Fitzgerald, will oversee 50,000 employees who do everything
from collecting economic statistics to running the census to issuing
weather reports. But he’s likely to spend a lot of time — along with
Jamieson Greer, Trump’s nominee to be the top U.S. trade negotiator —
managing the president’s aggressive plans to impose import taxes on U.S.
trading partners, including allies and adversaries alike.</p>
<p>The Senate vote to confirm Lutnick was 51-45.</p>
<p>Trump views the tariffs as a versatile economic tool. They can raise
money to finance his tax cuts elsewhere, protect U.S. industries and
pressure other countries into making concessions on such issues as their
own trade barriers, immigration and drug trafficking. Mainstream
economists mostly view tariffs as counterproductive: They are paid by
import companies in the United States, which try to pass along the
higher costs to consumers and can thereby add to inflationary pressures
throughout the economy.</p>
<p>At his confirmation hearing last month, Lutnick dismissed as
“nonsense’’ the idea that tariffs contribute to inflation. He expressed
support for deploying across-the-board tariffs”country by country’’ to
strong-arm other countries into lowering barriers to American
exports.</p>
<p>Trump last week announced plans for “reciprocal’’ tariffs — raising
U.S. import tax rates to match the higher taxes that other countries
impose on goods from the U.S. The move would shatter the rules that have
governed world trade for decades. Since the 1960s, tariff rates have
mostly emerged from negotiations between dozens of countries. Trump is
commandeering the process.</p>
<p>The president has also imposed 10% tariffs on Chinese imports and
effectively raised U.S. taxes on foreign steel and aluminum. He has
threatened — and delayed until March 4 — 25% tariffs on goods from
Canada and Mexico.</p>
<p>Lutnick was CEO at Cantor Fitzgerald when its offices were hit in the
Sept. 11, 2001, attack on the World Trade Center. The firm lost
two-thirds of its employees — 658 people — that day, including Lutnick’s
brother. Howard Lutnick led the firm’s recovery and is a member of the
Board of Directors of the National September 11 Memorial &amp;
Museum.</p>
<p>Lutnick has promised to sell off his business holdings. They’re
complicated. His financial disclosure statement showed that he had
positions in more than 800 businesses and other private
organizations.</p>

<h2 id="measles-cases-reported-in-us-states-of-texas-new-mexico">66
measles cases reported in US states of Texas, New Mexico</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Measles is making a comeback in the United States. </p>
<p>Fifty-eight cases of the highly contagious disease were reported
Tuesday by health officials in rural West Texas, while eight cases were
confirmed in neighboring eastern New Mexico.  </p>
<p>Texas officials say the outbreak there, the largest in almost 30
years, is mainly confined to Gaines County, with 45 infections, but four
other counties account for an additional 13 cases.   </p>
<p>The Texas measles cases, according to health officials, have occurred
mainly among a “close-knit, undervaccinated” Mennonite community. </p>
<p>Authorities say at least three of the New Mexico cases are in
counties that border Texas’ Gaines County. </p>
<p>Earlier this month, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention reported 14 measles cases across the country.  </p>
<p>Mayo Clinic describes measles as “a childhood infection caused by a
virus. Once quite common, measles can now almost always be prevented
with a vaccine … measles spreads easily and can be serious, and even
fatal, for small children.” </p>
<p>Measles is a respiratory virus that can survive in the air for two
hours. As many as nine out of 10 people who are susceptible will get the
virus if exposed, according to the CDC.  </p>
<p>However, in recent years, the necessity and safety of the
vaccinations designed to prevent the disease have come under question,
with some parents citing a now-discredited study that linked the measles
vaccine to autism.  </p>
<p>Another unfortunate development in the fight against measles happened
during the COVID-19 pandemic when many children missed their
vaccinations. Los Angeles Cedars Sinai said in a statement in February
2024 that 61 million fewer doses of the measles vaccine were distributed
nationwide from 2020 to 2022.  </p>
<p>Before the MMR vaccination, which addresses not only measles, but
also mumps and rubella, was introduced in the U.S. in 1963, there were 3
million to 4 million measles cases every year.   </p>
<p>Now there are usually fewer than 200 cases per year, but pockets of
measles persist in areas that still resist the vaccinations. The shots
are first given to toddlers between 12 and 15 months and then again at 4
to 6 years of age.</p>

id="saudi-prince-proving-crucial-to-trump-efforts-to-end-ukraine-gaza-wars">Saudi
prince proving crucial to Trump efforts to end Ukraine, Gaza wars</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Top U.S. and Russian officials wrapped up their meetings
Tuesday in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, to discuss a pathway to end the war in
Ukraine, days before Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is set to
convene a summit with leaders from Egypt, Jordan, Qatar and the United
Arab Emirates to discuss an Arab response to U.S. President Donald
Trump’s vow to take over Gaza.</p>
<p>The two separate talks reflect the growing role of the prince in
Trump’s efforts to fulfill his campaign promise to end the wars in
Ukraine and Gaza.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Trump again declared he would swiftly end fighting.</p>
<p>“I have the power to end this war,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago, his
residence in Florida, dismissing Ukrainian President Volodymyr
Zelenskyy’s concern that Kyiv was excluded from the Riyadh meeting.</p>
<p>“Well, you’ve been there for three years, you should have ended it,”
he said of Zelenskyy in response to a reporter’s question. “I could have
made a deal for Ukraine that would have given them almost all of the
land.”</p>
<p>Trump did not clarify which part of land would remain Ukrainian.
Russia began its full-scale invasion in February 2022 and now controls
parts of the Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia regions, and
fighting has been ongoing at the borders of Kharkiv and Mykolaiv. Russia
annexed Crimea in 2014.</p>
<p>The Saudi talks signaled a major détente between Washington and
Moscow and an abrupt end of U.S. policy under former President Joe Biden
to isolate Russia and support Ukraine “for as long as it takes.”</p>
<p>Instead, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio dangled the prospects of
“the incredible opportunities that exist to partner with the Russians”
on trade and other global issues when the war ends.</p>
<p>Arab response to Gaza plan</p>
<p>Later this week, Prince Mohammed will bring together leaders from
Egypt, Jordan, Qatar and the UAE to discuss an Arab response to Trump’s
vow to take over Gaza and create a “Riviera in the Middle East” by
expelling Palestinians from Gaza to neighboring countries.</p>
<p>Trump’s plan has angered regional leaders, who are now scrambling to
come up with a counteroffer that they will discuss in Riyadh ahead of a
broader Arab League gathering in Cairo next week.</p>
<p>One of the Arab proposals being discussed is an Egyptian-led plan
that involves forming a national Palestinian committee to govern Gaza
without Hamas and raising up to $20 billion from Arab and Gulf states
over three years for reconstruction.</p>
<p>As Saudi Arabia makes a play for the diplomatic mainstage, Prince
Mohammed is motivated to be proactive rather than reactive, to counsel
pragmatism rather than rigidity, said Laura Blumenfeld, a senior fellow
and Middle East analyst at the Johns Hopkins School for Advanced
International Studies.</p>
<p>Blumenfeld told VOA that the prince could pair his approach with a
language that Trump likes to speak: investments.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, global financiers and tech executives will gather in
Miami, Florida, in a conference hosted by the Future Investment
Initiative Institute, a nonprofit arm of Saudi Arabia’s Public
Investment Fund — the kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund led by the prince.
Trump is scheduled to deliver an address at the event.</p>
<p>“Trump is a peacemaker in a hurry, with his eye on the Nobel Prize.
[The prince] is a dealmaker in a hurry, with his eye on the Saudi Vision
2030 economic diversification plan,” Blumenfeld added. “The two men are
a match made in transactional heaven.”</p>
<p>Prince Mohammed the power broker</p>
<p>With his efforts focused on Ukraine and Gaza, the 39-year-old de
facto leader of Saudi Arabia has emerged as a power broker that Trump
leans on for his foreign policy goals.</p>
<p>Prince Mohammed has done this in part by leveraging close ties during
Trump’s first term, maintaining business ties while Trump was out of
office, and further expanding the relationship since the president’s
inauguration last month.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia was Trump’s first foreign trip in 2017, where he signed
several deals, including a $110 billion arms deal, which could expand up
to $350 billion over 10 years.</p>
<p>Trump spoke openly about the transactional nature of the visit,
telling reporters days after his second inauguration in January that the
reason he chose Riyadh for that first visit was because “they agreed to
buy $450 billion worth of our products.”</p>
<p>Trump suggested on the day of his last inauguration that he would
again make Saudi Arabia his first destination in return for Saudi funds,
and days later, the prince told him during a phone call that he planned
to invest $600 billion or more in the U.S. over the next four years.</p>
<p>In 2021, Saudi Arabia invested $2 billion with a firm that belonged
to Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and former aide. The Trump
Organization has also expanded its real estate presence in the region,
announcing it had leased its brand to two real estate projects in Riyadh
in December after launching the Trump Tower project in Jeddah.</p>
<p>As Prince Mohammed cultivated his political and business ties with
Trump, he maintained a relationship with Russian President Vladimir
Putin amid Biden’s effort to isolate the Russian leader following his
2022 invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>“The crown prince has been making the argument for the last five
years that it’s in America’s interest that Saudi Arabia maintains very
good ties with Russia and China,” said Ali Shihabi, author and
commentator on the politics and economics of Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>“Saudi Arabia was insisting on maintaining a multipolar policy while
maintaining very strong ties with the United States,” he told VOA.</p>
<p>The prince is poised to host a summit between the two leaders that
Trump said he agreed to during his call with Putin last week. The
summit, Shihabi said, would be an example of how the prince’s gambit has
paid off.</p>
<p>“I don’t think there are any leaders in the world that have the
relationship that the crown prince has with both Mr. Putin and
Mr. Trump,” he said.</p>
<p>There is also a practical reason. The kingdom is not a signatory of
the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, which issued an
arrest warrant for Putin in 2023.</p>

<h2 id="judge-wont-block-musk-doge-from-federal-data-layoffs">Judge
won’t block Musk, DOGE from federal data, layoffs</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — A federal judge refused Tuesday to immediately block
billionaire Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency from
accessing government data systems or participating in worker
layoffs. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan found that there are legitimate
questions about Musk’s authority but said there isn’t evidence of the
kind of grave legal harm that would justify a temporary restraining
order. </p>
<p>The decision came in a lawsuit filed by 14 Democratic states
challenging DOGE’s authority to access sensitive government data. The
attorneys general argued that Musk is wielding the kind of power that
the Constitution says can only be held by those who are elected or
confirmed by the Senate. </p>
<p>The Trump administration, for its part, has maintained that layoffs
are coming from agency heads, and asserted that despite his public
cheering of the effort, Musk isn’t directly running DOGE’s day-to-day
operations himself. </p>
<p>DOGE has tapped into computer systems across multiple agencies with
the blessing of President Donald Trump, digging into budgets and
searching for what he calls waste, fraud and abuse, even as a growing
number of lawsuits allege DOGE is violating the law. </p>
<p>Chutkan recognized the concerns of the group of states, which include
New Mexico and Arizona. </p>
<p>“DOGE’s unpredictable actions have resulted in considerable
uncertainty and confusion,” she wrote. Their questions about Musk’s
apparent “unchecked authority” and lack of Congressional oversight for
DOGE are legitimate and they may be able to successfully argue them
later. </p>
<p>Still, at this point, it remains unclear exactly how DOGE’s work will
affect the states, and judges can only issue court only issue orders to
block specific, immediate harms, she found. </p>
<p>Chutkan, who was nominated by Democratic President Barack Obama,
previously oversaw the now-dismissed criminal election interference case
against Trump in Washington.</p>

id="trump-signs-order-to-study-how-to-make-ivf-more-accessible-affordable">Trump
signs order to study how to make IVF more accessible, affordable</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WEST PALM BEACH, FLORIDA — U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday
signed an executive order to study how to expand access to in vitro
fertilization and make it more affordable. </p>
<p>The order calls for policy recommendations to “protect IVF access and
aggressively reduce out-of-pocket and health plan costs for such
treatments,” according to the White House. On the campaign trail, Trump
called for universal coverage of IVF treatment after his Supreme Court
nominees helped to overturn Roe v. Wade, leading to a wave of
restrictions in Republican-led states, including some that have
threatened access to IVF by trying to define life as beginning at
conception. </p>
<p>Trump, who was at his Florida residence and club Mar-a-Lago, also
signed another executive order and a presidential memorandum. The second
executive order outlined the oversight functions of the Office of
Management and Budget, while the presidential memorandum called for more
transparency from the government, according to White House staff
secretary Will Scharf, who Trump called to the podium to detail the
orders. </p>
<p>The order called for “radical transparency requirements” for the
government, requiring it to detail the “waste, fraud and abuse” that’s
found as the Department of Government Efficiency, overseen by Elon Musk,
looks to cut government spending. </p>
<p>DOGE has often fallen short of the administration’s promises of
transparency. Musk has taken questions from journalists only once since
becoming Trump’s most powerful adviser, and he’s claimed it’s illegal to
name people who are working for him. Sometimes DOGE staff members have
demanded access to sensitive government databases with little
explanation. </p>
<p>According to a fact sheet provided by the White House, Trump’s IVF
order will focus on prioritizing whether there are any current policies
“that exacerbate the cost of IVF treatments.” </p>
<p>Last year, Trump declared public support for IVF after the Alabama
Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos can be considered children under
state law. The decision, which some Republicans and conservatives
cheered, touched off immediate backlash. </p>
<p>Families ‘appreciative,’ says Trump</p>
<p>On the campaign trail, IVF quickly became a talking point for Trump,
who said he strongly supports its availability. </p>
<p>In vitro fertilization offers a possible solution when a woman has
trouble getting pregnant. The procedure involves retrieving her eggs and
combining them in a lab dish with a man’s sperm to create a fertilized
embryo, which is then transferred into the woman’s uterus in an attempt
to create a pregnancy. IVF is done in cycles, and more than one may be
required. </p>
<p>“I think the women and families, husbands, are very appreciative of
it,” Trump said in brief remarks on the order, before he took questions
on a variety of topics. </p>
<p>Trump, who spent the morning at his golf club in West Palm Beach,
Florida, spoke to reporters hours before his first joint TV interview
with adviser Elon Musk airs in prime time. </p>
<p>Trump and Musk gave their first joint interview to Sean Hannity of
Fox News Channel. The interview was taped on Friday at the White House
and is set to air as Musk leads Trump’s effort to cut federal spending
and slash the federal workforce. </p>
<p>Musk has drawn criticism from Democrats in Congress and others for
the methods he and his team at DOGE are using to cut spending, including
foreign aid, and eliminate jobs across the bureaucracy. </p>
<p>The Fox News interview also follows Musk’s appearance with Trump in
the Oval Office last week, when both defended Musk’s approach to federal
cost-cutting. </p>
<p>In an excerpt from the interview that Fox News released on Sunday,
Musk said he “used to be adored by the left” but “less so these days”
because of the work he’s doing at Trump’s direction. </p>
<p>“They call it Trump derangement syndrome. You don’t realize how real

<h2 id="us-postal-service-head-to-step-down-after-5-years">US Postal
Service head to step down after 5 years</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Louis DeJoy, the head of the U.S. Postal Service, intends to step
down, the federal agency said Tuesday, after a nearly five-year tenure
marked by the coronavirus pandemic, surges in mail-in election ballots
and efforts to stem losses through cost and service cuts.</p>
<p>In a Monday letter, Postmaster General DeJoy asked the Postal Service
Board of Governors to begin looking for his successor.</p>
<p>“As you know, I have worked tirelessly to lead the 640,000 men and
women of the Postal Service in accomplishing an extraordinary
transformation,” he wrote. “We have served the American people through
an unprecedented pandemic and through a period of high inflation and
sensationalized politics.”</p>
<p>DeJoy took the helm of the Postal Service in the summer of 2020
during President Donald Trump’s first term. He was a Republican donor
who owned a logistics business before taking office and was the first
postmaster general in nearly two decades who was not a career postal
employee.</p>
<p>DeJoy developed a 10-year plan to modernize operations and stem
losses. He previously said that postal customers should get used to
“uncomfortable” rate hikes as the Postal Service seeks to stabilize its
finances and become more self-sufficient.</p>
<p>The plan calls for making the mail delivery system more efficient and
less costly by consolidating mail processing centers. Critics, including
members of Congress from several states, have said the first
consolidations slowed service and that further consolidations could
particularly hurt rural mail delivery.</p>
<p>DeJoy has disputed that and told a U.S. House subcommittee during a
contentious September hearing that the Postal Service had embarked on
long-overdue investments in facilities and making other changes to
create “a Postal Service for the future” that delivered mail more
quickly.</p>
<p>DeJoy also oversaw the Postal Service during two presidential
elections that saw spikes in mail-in ballots.</p>
<p>Ahead of the 2020 presidential election, a federal judge limited one
of the Postal Service’s cost-cutting practices after finding it
contributed to delays in mail delivery.</p>
<p>DeJoy had restricted overtime payments for postal workers and stopped
the agency’s longtime practice of allowing late and extra truck
deliveries in the summer of 2020. The moves reduced costs but meant some
mail was left to be delivered the following day.</p>
<p>DeJoy said in his letter that he was committed to being “as helpful
as possible in facilitating a transition.”</p>

<p>
Today we’re talking about bird flu. It’s infecting flocks of chickens,
causing egg prices to rise across the country, plus herds of dairy
cattle and people are getting sick too. And all of this is happening
amid sweeping changes at U.S. federal health agencies. The Trump
administration has ordered
<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-disease-detectives-doge-cuts-health-agencies/">mass
firings</a> and
<a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/13/nx-s1-5297177/cdc-scientists-publications-trump-administration">limits
on public communications</a> at agencies including the Centers for
Disease Control, hindering its ability to keep the public informed. On
the show today,  Jessica Malaty Rivera, an epidemiologist and science
communicator explains the scale of the current bird flu outbreak, how
the response in the United States has been disrupted by chaos in the
federal government, and why state health systems may struggle to fill
the gaps after years of underfunding.

<h2 id="more-than-170-migrants-now-detained-at-guantanamo-bay">More than
170 migrants now detained at Guantanamo Bay</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The United States has more than doubled the number of
detainees — both those deemed to be a “high threat” as well as others
slated for deportation — at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay,
Cuba. </p>
<p>As of Tuesday, there were more than 120 of what the administration
calls “criminal aliens” under guard at the detention facility at
Guantanamo Bay, according to a U.S. defense official.  </p>
<p>Approximately 50 other individuals are also being held at the base’s
migrant facility, which was being readied to hold nonviolent
individuals.  </p>
<p>Separately, a second U.S. defense official told VOA that as of
Monday, the U.S. military had sent a total of 13 flights of undocumented
migrants to Guantanamo aboard a mix of C-17 and C-130 military cargo
jets. </p>
<p>So far, none of the detainees brought to the facilities at Guantanamo
Bay have been deported to other countries. </p>
<p>Both officials spoke to VOA on the condition of anonymity in order to
discuss details of the military’s deportation operation. </p>
<p>VOA has also reached out to the Department of Homeland Security,
which is spearheading the U.S. deportation efforts, as well as
Immigration and Customs Enforcement, about the growing number of
detainees. </p>
<p>Last Thursday, the commander of U.S. Southern Command, which oversees
operations at the naval base at Guantanamo Bay, told lawmakers there
were about 68 detainees at the base’s prison facility. </p>
<p>Admiral Alvin Holsey also told lawmakers that the base’s migrant
facility had the capacity to hold about 2,500 nonviolent detainees.
Efforts are underway to allow it house as many as 30,000 nonviolent
migrants slated for deportation.  </p>
<p>Holsey said that it was too soon to determine how much it will cost
to house the growing number of individuals.  </p>
<p>“We’re working with DHS to understand the flow of migrants,” he said
during Thursday’s hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee.
“We’re not going to go to 30,000 unless we know that migrant flow will
come. So, we’re waiting at this point.”    </p>
<p>Details about the growing population of detainees at the U.S. naval
base in Cuba come just a day after the Department of Homeland Security
unveiled what it described as a multimillion-dollar ad campaign warning
migrants not to enter the U.S. illegally. </p>
<p>“If you are considering entering America illegally, don’t even think
about it,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a video
targeting an international audience. </p>
<p>“If you come to our country and you break our laws, we will hunt you
down,” she said. “Criminals are not welcome in the United States.” </p>
<p>Noem, who visited the prison facility last Friday and oversaw the
transfer of a third flight of detainees to the detention center, has
repeatedly described the men as “murderers and vicious gang members”
from Venezuela and as “the worst of the worst.”   </p>
<p>In one social media post, Noem said that at least one of the migrants
sent to Guantanamo Bay had confessed to murder, while others were wanted
for attempted murder, assault, weapons trafficking and
impersonation. </p>
<p>One official, speaking to VOA on the condition of anonymity to
discuss the deportation efforts, said that all of the individuals held
at Guantanamo Bay have been issued final deportation orders. But DHS has
not yet provided charging documents or other details regarding the
crimes the detainees are accused of committing.   </p>
<p>Last Wednesday, the American Civil Liberties Union, along with
several immigration rights groups, filed a lawsuit against DHS, alleging
the detainees being held at the Guantanamo Bay prison facility have been
improperly denied access to lawyers.  </p>
<p>DHS has dismissed the lawsuit’s allegations.  </p>
<p>“There is a system for phone utilization to reach lawyers,” said a
senior Homeland Security official in a written statement shared with
VOA.  </p>
<p>“If the AMERICAN Civil Liberties Union cares more about highly
dangerous criminal aliens including murderers &amp; vicious gang members
than they do about American citizens — they should change their name,”
the official added, responding to the lawsuit only on the condition of
anonymity.</p>

id="rubio-snubs-south-africas-g20-meeting-amid-diplomatic-tensions">Rubio
snubs South Africa’s G20 meeting amid diplomatic tensions</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Johannesburg  — South Africa will host a meeting of foreign ministers
from the G20 group of major economies later this week, but the chief
diplomat for the world’s largest economy, the U.S., is skipping it.</p>
<p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced on X earlier this month that
he would not attend the meeting, taking place Thursday and Friday in
Johannesburg, because he objected to the meeting’s agenda, which he
described as anti-American.</p>
<p>He said South Africa was “using G20 to promote ‘solidarity, equality,
&amp; sustainability.’ In other words: DEI and climate change. My job is
to advance America’s national interests, not waste taxpayer money or
coddle anti-Americanism.”</p>
<p>DEI is short for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, and in President
Donald Trump’s first week in the White House, he signed an executive
order to end DEI policies and hiring practices in the federal
workforce.</p>
<p>“I think the whole topic of the G20 gathering is one that I don’t
think we should be focused on, talking about global inclusion, equity,
and these sorts of things,” Rubio later told the press.</p>
<p>He continued by saying the forum should be focused on issues “like
terrorism and energy security and the real threats to the national
security of multiple countries.”</p>
<p>The G20 is a group of the world’s 19 major individual economies as
well as the EU and African Union. This year marks the first time an
African country is in the rotating presidency position of the G20.</p>
<p>While Rubio will not attend, the South African government has
confirmed the U.S. will still have a presence at the meeting, likely at
a lower level.</p>
<p>South Africa’s Department of International Relations and Cooperation
responded to Rubio in a statement saying: “Our G20 Presidency, is not
confined to just climate change but also equitable treatment for nations
of the Global South, ensuring an equal global system for all.”</p>
<p>Ronald Lamola, minister of international relations and cooperation,
told local TV that the meeting’s agenda had been adopted by all members
of the G20 and carries on the themes from previous summits, such as the
one in Brazil last year.</p>
<p>Deteriorating relations</p>
<p>Even before the announcement that Rubio would not be taking part in
the foreign ministers’ meeting, there had been a swift deterioration in
U.S.-South Africa relations under the new administration in
Washington.</p>
<p>President Trump accused South Africa’s government of engaging in land
grabs and mistreating white minority Afrikaners. He cut U.S. financial
assistance to the country.</p>
<p>While the South African government did pass a controversial land
reform law earlier this year, no land has been seized. The white
minority is still one of the country’s most privileged communities and
owns the majority of private farmland.</p>
<p>Response from other G20 members</p>
<p>Several other nations were quick to affirm their attendance at the
meeting after Rubio said he will not attend.</p>
<p>Those included EU members Germany, Italy and France, whose
ambassadors to South Africa posted a joint video on X saying they were
“united in diversity” and shared the South African government’s
democratic values.</p>
<p>Russia also confirmed Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov will attend.</p>
<p>“The priorities stated by the South African presidency are designed
to encourage economic growth, reduce inequality and imbalances, and
ensure equitable access to financing for countries in the Global
South.,” said Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova.</p>
<p>China likewise confirmed its commitment to the meeting, with
ambassador to South Africa Wu Peng meeting foreign minister Lamola just
after Rubio’s announcement and posting on X: “I also expressed China’s
readiness to support South Africa’s G20 Presidency.”</p>
<p>Last week, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun, said in a
press briefing,</p>
<p>“China stands ready to work with all parties to make this meeting a
productive one, and send a strong message of supporting multilateralism,
strengthening solidarity and cooperation, and jointly responding to
global challenges,” he said.</p>
<p>Analysts weigh in</p>
<p>Political analysts said Rubio’s absence could provide space for
countries hostile to the U.S. to advance their agendas.</p>
<p>“Will we see the increase of countries like Russia and China pushing
their lines, their issues, their perspectives in the absence of the US?
That’s entirely possible,” Steven Gruzd, from the South African
Institute of International Affairs, told VOA.</p>
<p>Brooks Spector, a retired U.S. diplomat, said Rubio’s boycott of the
meeting was “a serious misstep.”</p>
<p>“You get to make your points at a meeting, boycotting it simply means
your voice is not heard,” he said. “Calling the meeting “anti-American”
is a misunderstanding of the nature of bilateral, international and
multi-lateral discussions.”</p>
<p>However, he said he expected Trump would likely still attend the
major G20 summit in South Africa in November. In December, the U.S. will
take on the presidency of the G20.</p>

US looks for ‘fair, sustainable’ end to Russian war on Ukraine</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Tuesday that the United
States is working toward a “fair” and “sustainable” solution to end
Russia’s three-year war on Ukraine, but that both Moscow and Kyiv would
have to make concessions to achieve peace.</p>
<p>Rubio offered his assessment after he and other key U.S. officials
met for more than four hours in Saudi Arabia with Russian Foreign
Minister Sergey Lavrov and his aides in a first effort toward ending the
war and improving the contentious Washington-Moscow relationship.</p>
<p>“The goal is to bring an end to this conflict in a way that’s fair,
enduring, sustainable and acceptable to all parties involved,” Rubio
told reporters, although no Ukrainian or European officials were at the
table for the talks.</p>
<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy objected to being excluded
from the meeting, a position that drew criticism from U.S. President
Donald Trump.</p>
<p>“Today I heard, ‘Well, we weren’t invited.’ Well, you’ve been there
for three years,” Trump said of Ukraine’s leaders. “You should have
never started it.”</p>
<p>While speaking to reporters at his Florida residence, Trump said he
thought he had a “good chance” to end the war. But Zelenskyy has said
his country will not agree to a U.S.-Russian dictated settlement of the
war.</p>
<p>Zelenskyy postponed a trip to Saudi Arabia that had been scheduled
for this week, suggesting that he wanted to avoid his visit being linked
to the negotiations He is due to host the U.S. envoy for Ukraine, Keith
Kellogg, for talks on Wednesday.</p>
<p>In Saudi Arabia, Rubio said he was convinced that Moscow was willing
to engage in a “serious process” to end the war, which Russia started
with a full-scale invasion of its neighbor three years ago next
week. </p>
<p>Lavrov had a similar upbeat view of the talks, saying, “We weren’t
just listening to each other, but we heard each other. I have reason to
believe that the American side started to better understand our
positions.”</p>

<p>Tens of thousands of Russian and Ukrainian soldiers, along with
Ukrainian civilians, have been killed in the fighting, Europe’s worst
conflict since World War II.</p>
<p>The U.S. and Russia agreed to “appoint respective high-level teams to
begin working on a path to ending the conflict in Ukraine as soon as
possible,” State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said in a statement.
Bruce characterized the meeting as “an important step forward” toward
peace.</p>
<p>Rubio said Ukraine and European nations would have to be involved in
talks on ending the war. He said that if the war is halted, the U.S.
would have “extraordinary opportunities … to partner” with Russia on
trade and other global issues.</p>
<p>“The key to unlock that is the end to this conflict,” he said.</p>
<p>National security adviser Mike Waltz and Middle East envoy Steve
Witkoff joined Rubio for the talks.</p>
<p>Waltz told reporters that negotiations to end the fighting will focus
on territory and security guarantees for both Ukraine and Russia.</p>
<p>“This needs to be a permanent end to the war and not a temporary end,
as we’ve seen in the past,” Waltz said.</p>
<p>Russia now controls about a fifth of Ukraine’s internationally
recognized 2014 territory. Moscow controls the Crimean Peninsula that it
unilaterally annexed in 2014, along with a large portion of eastern
Ukraine pro-Russian separatists captured in subsequent fighting and
lands the Russian military have taken over since the 2022 invasion.</p>
<p>As the invasion started, Moscow hoped for a quick takeover of all of
Ukraine. But with stiff Ukrainian resistance, the war instead evolved
into a grinding ground conflict and daily aerial bombardments by each
side.  </p>
<p>Zelenskyy has long demanded that his country’s 2014 boundaries be
restored, but U.S. officials have said that is unrealistic, as was
Kyiv’s long-sought goal of joining NATO, the West’s main military
alliance, as part of a negotiated peace settlement. </p>
<p>Bruce said the Rubio-Lavrov talks, the first extensive discussions
between the two countries in more than three years, also laid the
groundwork for more talks aside from the negotiations to end the
war. </p>
<p>She said the two sides would “establish a consultation mechanism to
address irritants to our bilateral relationship with the objective of
taking steps necessary to normalize the operation of our respective
diplomatic missions.”</p>
<p>Bruce said the U.S. and Russia would “lay the groundwork for future
cooperation on matters of mutual geopolitical interest and historic
economic and investment opportunities” once the war is ended.</p>
<p>The U.S.-Russia engagement sparked concern among European leaders who
in recent days have highlighted the need for Ukraine to be involved in
discussions about its future, and for European nations to play a role in
what they also see as a key development for their own security.</p>
<p>French President Emmanuel Macron convened a group of European leaders
for a Monday session in Paris, where they discussed boosting defense
spending and potential security guarantees for Ukraine.</p>
<p>There was division on the idea of deploying peacekeepers to Ukraine
as part of a potential end to the war, with governments such as Britain
and Sweden expressing openness to the idea while German Chancellor Olaf
Scholz said that discussion was premature.</p>

Peltier leaves prison after Biden commuted sentence in killing of FBI
agents</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SUMTERVILLE, FLORIDA — Native American activist Leonard Peltier was
released from a Florida prison on Tuesday, weeks after then-President
Joe Biden angered law enforcement officials by commuting his life
sentence in the 1975 killings of two FBI agents.  </p>
<p>For nearly half a century, Peltier’s imprisonment has symbolized
systemic injustice for Native Americans across the country who believe
in his innocence. The decision to release the 80-year-old to home
confinement was celebrated by supporters.  </p>
<p>“He represents every person who’s been roughed up by a cop, profiled,
had their children harassed at school,” said Nick Estes, a professor of
American Indian Studies at the University of Minnesota and a member of
the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe who advocated for Peltier’s release.  </p>
<p>But the move just before Biden left office also prompted criticism
from those who say Peltier is guilty, including former FBI Director
Christopher Wray, who called him “a remorseless killer” in a private
letter to Biden obtained by The Associated Press. </p>
<p> “Granting Peltier any relief from his conviction or sentence is
wholly unjustified and would be an affront to the rule of law,” Wray
wrote.  </p>
<p>The commutation was not a pardon for crimes committed, something
Peltier’s advocates have hoped for since he has always maintained his
innocence.  </p>
<p>Peltier left the prison Tuesday morning in an SUV, according to a
prison official. He didn’t stop to speak with reporters or his
supporters outside the gates. One of his attorneys, Jenipher Jones, said
Peltier was looking forward to going home.  </p>
<p>“We’re so excited for this moment,” Jones said. “He is in good
spirits. He has the soul of a warrior.”  </p>
<p>After being released from USP Coleman, a high-security prison,
Peltier planned to return to North Dakota, where he is expected to
celebrate with friends and family on Wednesday. </p>
<p> Biden commuted Peltier’s sentence Jan. 20, noting he had spent most
of his life in prison and was now in poor health.  </p>
<p>“We never thought he would get out,” Ray St. Clair, a member of the
White Earth Band of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, said shortly before
Peltier’s release. “It shows you should never give up hope. We can take
this repairing the damage that was done. This is a start.” </p>
<p>Peltier, an enrolled member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa
Indians in North Dakota, was active in the American Indian Movement,
which beginning in the 1960s fought for Native American treaty rights
and tribal self-determination.  </p>
<p>The group grabbed headlines in 1969 when activists occupied the
former prison island of Alcatraz in the San Francisco Bay, and again in
1972, when they presented presidential candidates with a list of demands
including the restoration of tribal land.  </p>
<p>After they were ignored, they seized the headquarters of the Bureau
of Indian Affairs. From then on, the group was subject to FBI
surveillance and harassment under a covert program that sought to
disrupt activism and was exposed in 1975.  </p>
<p>Peltier’s conviction stemmed from a confrontation that year on the
Oglala Sioux Indian Reservation in Pine Ridge, South Dakota, in which
FBI agents Jack Coler and Ronald Williams were killed.  </p>
<p>According to the FBI, the agents were there to serve arrest warrants
for robbery and assault with a dangerous weapon. Prosecutors maintained
at trial that Peltier shot both agents in the head at point-blank
range.  </p>
<p>Peltier acknowledged being present and firing a gun at a distance,
but he said he fired in self-defense. A woman who claimed to have seen
Peltier shoot the agents later recanted her testimony, saying it had
been coerced. He was convicted of two counts of first-degree murder and
given two consecutive life sentences. Two other movement members,
co-defendants Robert Robideau and Dino Butler, were acquitted on the
grounds of self-defense. Peltier was denied parole as recently as July
and was not eligible to be considered for it again until 2026.  </p>
<p>“Leonard Peltier’s release is the right thing to do given the serious
and ongoing human rights concerns about the fairness of his trial, his
nearly 50 years behind bars, his health and his age,” Paul O’Brien,
executive director with Amnesty International USA, said in a statement
before Peltier’s release. “While we welcome his release from prison, he
should not be restricted to home confinement.”  </p>
<p>Prominent Native American groups like the National Congress of the
American Indian have called for Peltier’s release for decades, and
Amnesty International considered him a political prisoner.  </p>
<p>Prominent supporters over the years included South African Archbishop
Desmond Tutu, civil rights icon Coretta Scott King, actor and director
Robert Redford, and musicians Pete Seeger, Harry Belafonte and Jackson
Browne.  </p>
<p>Generations of Indigenous activists and leaders lobbied multiple
presidents to pardon Peltier. Former Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, a
member of the Pueblo of Laguna and the first Native American to hold the
secretary’s position, praised Biden’s decision. “I am grateful that
Leonard can now go home to his family,” she said Jan. 20 in a post on X.
“I applaud President Biden for this action and understanding what this
means to Indian Country.”  </p>
<p>As a young child, Peltier was taken from his family and sent to a
boarding school. Thousands of Indigenous children over decades faced the
same fate, and were in many cases subjected to systemic physical,
psychological and sexual abuse.  </p>
<p>“He hasn’t really had a home since he was taken away to boarding
school,” said Nick Tilsen, who has been advocating for Peltier’s release
since he was a teen and is CEO of NDN Collective, an Indigenous-led
advocacy group based in South Dakota. “So he is excited to be at home
and paint and have grandkids running around.”</p>

Security head steps down over DOGE access of recipient information: AP
sources</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The Social Security Administration’s acting commissioner
has stepped down from her role at the agency over Department of
Government Efficiency requests to access Social Security recipient
information, according to two people familiar with the official’s
departure who were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.</p>
<p>Acting Commissioner Michelle King’s departure from the agency over
the weekend — after more than 30 years of service — was initiated after
King refused to provide DOGE staffers at the SSA with access to
sensitive information, the people said Monday.</p>
<p>The White House has replaced her as acting commissioner with Leland
Dudek, who currently works at the SSA, the people said.</p>
<p>White House spokesperson Harrison Fields released a statement Monday
night saying: “President Trump has nominated the highly qualified and
talented Frank Bisignano to lead the Social Security Administration, and
we expect him to be swiftly confirmed in the coming weeks. In the
meantime, the agency will be led by a career Social Security anti-fraud
expert as the acting commissioner.”</p>
<p>Fields added, “President Trump is committed to appointing the best
and most qualified individuals who are dedicated to working on behalf of
the American people, not to appease the bureaucracy that has failed them
for far too long.”</p>
<p>King’s exit from the administration is one of several departures of
high-ranking officials concerned about DOGE staffers’ potential unlawful
access to private taxpayer information.</p>
<p>DOGE has accessed Treasury payment systems and is attempting to
access Internal Revenue Service databases.</p>
<p>Since Republican President Donald Trump has retaken the White House,
his billionaire adviser Elon Musk has rapidly burrowed deep into federal
agencies while avoiding public scrutiny of his work through the DOGE
group.</p>
<p>Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, an advocacy group
for the preservation of Social Security benefits, said of DOGE’s efforts
that “there is no way to overstate how serious a breach this is. And my
understanding is that it has already occurred.”</p>
<p>“The information collected and securely held by the Social Security
Administration is highly sensitive,” she said. “SSA has data on everyone
who has a Social Security number, which is virtually all Americans,
everyone who has Medicare, and every low-income American who has applied
for Social Security’s means-tested companion program, Supplemental
Security Income.”</p>
<p>“If there is an evil intent to punish perceived enemies, someone
could erase your earnings record, making it impossible to collect the
Social Security and Medicare benefits you have earned.”</p>
<p>The future of Social Security has become a top political issue and
was a major point of contention in the 2024 election. About 72.5 million
people, including retirees, disabled people and children, receive Social
Security benefits.</p>

<p>A Russian drone hit an apartment building in the central Ukrainian
city of Dolynska, officials said Tuesday, injuring at least three
people.</p>
<p>Andriy Raikovych, governor of the Kirovohrad region where the attack
took place, said on Telegram that authorities evacuated dozens of people
from the building and that those injured included a mother and two
children.</p>
<p>The attack was part of a widespread Russian aerial assault overnight,
which the Ukrainian military said included 176 drones.</p>
<p>Ukrainian air defenses shot down 103 of the drones, with intercepts
taking place over the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv,
Kherson, Kirovohrad, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Poltava, Sumy, Vinnytsia and
Zhytomyr regions, the military said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Cherkasy Governor Ihor Taburets said on Telegram that debris from a
destroyed drone damaged four houses in his region.</p>
<p>Russia’s Defense Ministry said Tuesday it destroyed five Ukrainian
drones, including four over the Voronezh region and one over
Belgorod.</p>
<p>Both regions are located along the Russia-Ukraine border and are
frequent targets of Ukrainian drone attacks.</p>
<p>Voronezh Governor Alexander Gusev said on Telegram there were no
reports of casualties or damage.</p>

Russian officials meet to discuss Ukraine war, bilateral relations</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Top U.S. and Russian diplomats met for several hours Tuesday in Saudi
Arabia about relations between their countries and a potential end to
Russia’s war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Both sides tempered expectations ahead of time, describing the talks
as an initial step that could lay the framework for direct talks between
U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio led the U.S. delegation, which
included national security adviser Mike Waltz and Middle East envoy
Steve Witkoff.</p>
<p>Russia’s side included Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and senior
Putin aide Yuri Ushakov.</p>
<p>Ukrainian leaders said they were not invited to participate.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is due to host the U.S. envoy
for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, for talks on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The U.S.-Russia engagement sparked concern among European leaders who
in recent days have highlighted the need for Ukraine to be involved in

<p>“We seek a strong and lasting peace in Ukraine. To achieve this,
Russia must end its aggression, and this must be accompanied by strong
and credible security guarantees for the Ukrainians,” Macron said on
X.</p>
<p>The French leader said he had spoken with Trump and Zelenskyy after
the Paris talks, and that it is important for Europeans, Americans and
Ukrainians to work together.</p>
<p>Zelenskyy expressed a need for “robust and reliable” security
guarantees, saying that otherwise Russia will just start another war
with Ukraine or other nations in Europe.</p>

<h2 id="costa-rica-will-receive-deported-migrants-from-us">Costa Rica
will receive deported migrants from US</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>San Jose, Costa Rica — Costa Rica announced Monday it would receive
migrants from other countries who were deported by the United States,
following in the footsteps of Panama and Guatemala.</p>
<p>“The Government of Costa Rica agreed to collaborate with the United
States in the repatriation of 200 illegal immigrants to their country,”
the Costa Rican president’s office said in a statement, adding that
“these are people originating from … Central Asia and India.”</p>
<p>Costa Rica is the third country in Central America to collaborate on
repatriating deported migrants from the United States since President
Donald Trump assumed office in Washington on Jan. 20. </p>
<p>The first set of deportees will arrive in Costa Rica on Wednesday
aboard a commercial flight, according to the statement, whereupon they
will be transported to a Temporary Migrant Care Center near the border
with Panama. </p>
<p>The statement specified that “the process will be completely
financed” by the U.S. government under the supervision of the
International Organization for Migration. </p>
<p>Panama and Guatemala had previously agreed to a similar arrangement
when U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited on a recent tour of
Latin America. </p>
<p>Panama received its first repatriation flight with 119 migrants
aboard last week, originating from China, Pakistan, Afghanistan and
elsewhere, according to Panamanian officials. None have arrived yet in
Guatemala.</p>
<p>Latin America is the original home of most of the United States’
estimated 11 million undocumented migrants.</p>

top New York City officials resign as turmoil ripples over mayor’s
corruption case</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Four top deputies to New York City Mayor Eric Adams are
resigning in the latest fallout from the Justice Department’s push to
end a corruption case against Adams and ensure his cooperation in
President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown — a bargain that has
raised questions about the mayor’s political independence and ability to
lead the city.</p>
<p>In a statement Monday, Adams confirmed the departures of First Deputy
Mayor Maria Torres-Springer, Deputy Mayor for Operations Meera Joshi,
Deputy Mayor for Health and Human Services Anne Williams-Isom and Deputy
Mayor for Public Safety Chauncey Parker.</p>
<p>“I am disappointed to see them go, but given the current challenges,
I understand their decision and wish them nothing but success in the
future,” said Adams, who faces several challengers in June’s Democratic
primary. “But let me be crystal clear: New York City will keep moving
forward, just as it does every day.”</p>
<p>City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams became the latest Democrat to
call on the mayor to resign, saying that with the deputy mayor
resignations it’s clear he “has now lost the confidence and trust of his
own staff, his colleagues in government and New Yorkers.”</p>
<p>Speaker Adams is not related to the mayor.</p>
<p>Torres-Springer, Joshi and Williams-Isom told agency heads and staff
in a memo that they were exiting because of “the extraordinary events of
the last few weeks.”</p>
<p>They did not give a date for their departures, but Adams said they
and Parker will remain “for the time being to ensure a seamless
transition.”</p>
<p>Adams has faced increasing scrutiny since the Justice Department’s
second-in-command ordered federal prosecutors in Manhattan last week to
drop the mayor’s corruption case. Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil
Bove wrote that the case had “unduly restricted Mayor Adams’ ability to
devote full attention and resources to the illegal immigration and
violent crime.”</p>
<p>That directive touched off firestorms within the Justice Department
and New York political circles, with seven federal prosecutors quitting
in protest — including the interim U.S. attorney for Manhattan — and
fellow Democrats calling on Adams to resign.</p>
<p>On Friday, after a week of recriminations and resignations, Bove and
a pair of Justice Department officials from Washington stepped in and
filed paperwork asking Manhattan federal Judge Dale E. Ho to dismiss the
case. Ho has yet to take action on the request.</p>
<p>Adams, a former police captain, pleaded not guilty last September to
charges that he accepted more than $100,000 in illegal campaign
contributions and lavish travel perks from foreign nationals looking to
buy his influence while he was Brooklyn borough president campaigning to
be mayor.</p>
<p>The Justice Department said in its filing Friday that it was seeking
to dismiss Adams’ charges with the option of refiling them later, which
critics see as a carrot to ensure his compliance on the Republican
president’s objectives. In his memo ordering prosecutors to ditch the
case, Bove said the new, permanent U.S. attorney would review the matter
after the November election.</p>
<p>“It certainly sounds like President Trump is holding the mayor
hostage,” Reverend Al Sharpton, an Adams ally, said Tuesday. “I have
supported the mayor, but he has been put in an unfair position — even
for him — of essentially political blackmail.”</p>
<p>Political leaders, including Democratic Representatives Alexandria
Ocasio Cortez and Nydia Velázquez, and Lieutenant Governor Antonio
Delgado have called on Adams to step down. But Democratic Governor Kathy
Hochul has said she’s taking a more deliberative approach.</p>
<p>“The allegations are extremely concerning and serious, but I cannot
as the governor of this state have a knee-jerk, politically motivated
reaction like a lot of other people are saying right now,” she told
MSNBC on Thursday. “I’ve got to do it smart, what’s right, and I’m
consulting with other leaders in government right now.”</p>
<p>The drama over Adams’ legal case played out as the mayor met with
Trump’s border czar in New York on Thursday and announced increased
cooperation on the Trump administration’s efforts to remove immigrants,
including reestablishing an office for immigration authorities at the
city’s notorious Rikers Island jail.</p>
<p>In their memo to staff announcing their exits, Torres-Springer, Joshi
and Williams-Isom wrote, “Due to the extraordinary events of the last
few weeks and to stay faithful to the oaths we swore to New Yorkers and
our families, we have come to the difficult decision to step down from
our roles.”</p>

id="trump-begins-firings-of-faa-air-traffic-control-staff-just-weeks-after-fatal-dc-plane-crash">Trump
begins firings of FAA air traffic control staff just weeks after fatal
DC plane crash</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The Trump administration began firing several hundred
Federal Aviation Administration employees on a busy air travel weekend
and just weeks after a January fatal midair collision at Ronald Reagan
Washington National Airport.</p>
<p>Probationary workers were targeted in late-night emails Friday
notifying them they had been fired, David Spero, president of the
Professional Aviation Safety Specialists union, said in a statement.</p>
<p>The workers include personnel hired for FAA radar, landing and
navigational aid maintenance, one air traffic controller told The
Associated Press. The air traffic controller was not authorized to talk
to the media and spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>A Transportation Department official told the AP late Monday that no
air traffic controllers were affected by the cuts and that the agency
has “retained employees who perform critical safety functions.” In a
follow-up query, the agency said they would have to look into whether
the radar, landing and navigational aid workers who were fired were
considered to handle critical safety functions.</p>
<p>The National Air Traffic Controllers Association said in a brief
statement Monday it was “analyzing the effect of the reported federal
employee terminations on aviation safety, the national airspace system
and our members.”</p>
<p>Other FAA employees who were fired were working on an urgent and
classified early warning radar system the Air Force had announced in
2023 for Hawaii to detect incoming cruise missiles, through a program
that was in part funded by the Defense Department. It’s one of several
programs that the FAA’s National Defense Program manages that involve
radars providing longer-range detection around the country’s
borders.</p>
<p>Due to the nature of their work, staff in that office typically
provide an extensive knowledge transfer before retiring to make sure no
institutional knowledge is lost, said Charles Spitzer-Stadtlander, one
of the employees in that branch who was terminated.</p>
<p>The Hawaii radar and the FAA National Defense Program office working
on it are “about protecting national security,” Spitzer-Stadtlander
said. “I don’t think they even knew what NDP does, they just thought, oh
no big deal, he just works for the FAA.”</p>
<p>“This is about protecting national security, and I’m scared to
death,” Spitzer-Stadtlander said. “And the American public should be
scared too.”</p>
<p>Spero said messages began arriving after 7 p.m. Friday and continued
late into the night. More might be notified over the long weekend or
barred from entering FAA buildings Tuesday, he said.</p>
<p>The employees were fired “without cause nor based on performance or
conduct,” Spero said, and the emails were “from an ‘exec order’
Microsoft email address” — not a government email address. A copy of the
termination email that was provided to the AP shows the sending address
“ASK_AHR_EXEC_Orders@usfaa.mail.outlook.com.”</p>
<p>The firings hit the FAA as it is facing a shortfall in controllers.
Federal officials have been raising concerns about an overtaxed and
understaffed air traffic control system for years, especially after a
series of close calls between planes at U.S. airports. Among the reasons
they have cited for staffing shortages are uncompetitive pay, long
shifts, intensive training and mandatory retirements.</p>
<p>In the January 29 fatal collision between a U.S. Army Black Hawk
helicopter and American Airlines passenger jet, which is still under
investigation, one controller was handing both commercial airline and
helicopter traffic at the busy airport.</p>
<p>Days before the collision, President Donald Trump fired all the
members of the Aviation Security Advisory Committee, a panel mandated by
Congress after the 1988 PanAm 103 bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland. The
committee is charged with examining safety issues at airlines and
airports.</p>
<p>Spitzer-Stadtlander suggested he was targeted for firing for his
views on Tesla and X, formerly Twitter, not as part of a general
probationary-level sweep. Both companies are owned by Elon Musk, whose
Department of Government Efficiency is leading Trump’s effort to cut the
federal government.</p>
<p>DOGE did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The
firings were first reported by CNN.</p>

id="american-arrested-in-moscow-on-drug-smuggling-charges-freed">American
arrested in Moscow on drug smuggling charges freed</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Russia has freed a U.S. citizen arrested earlier this month on drug
smuggling charges, according to Russian media reports and a U.S.
official. </p>
<p>The move appears to be an effort to ease tensions between Moscow and
Washington ahead of talks in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. </p>
<p>Kalob Byers, 28, was detained on Feb. 7 at Moscow’s Vnukovo airport
after customs officials allegedly found cannabis-laced marmalade in his
baggage. According to media reports, Byers had traveled from Istanbul
with his Russian fiancee, who was also detained. The authorities said he
had attempted to smuggle a “significant amount” of drugs into the
country and put him in custody on the charges of drug smuggling,
punishable by a prison term of up to 10 years. </p>
<p>Byers has been released from custody and is in the U.S. Embassy in
Moscow where he is awaiting a flight home, Russian independent news
outlet Meduza reported Monday, citing a Facebook post by his parents. A
U.S. official confirmed to The Associated Press that Byers was released
to the embassy late Sunday evening. The official spoke on the condition
of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss sensitive
matters. </p>
<p>Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters Monday in response
to a question about Byers that Moscow expects “to discuss restoring the
entire complex of Russian-American relations” at the talks in Saudi
Arabia on Tuesday, “so certain events can be viewed in this
context.” </p>
<p>It wasn’t immediately clear whether Byers’ fiancee was also released.
Russian media reports identified her as Naida Mambetova and said she was
placed in pre-trial detention on the same charges. </p>
<p>Arrests of American nationals in Russia have become increasingly
common in recent years, with relations between Moscow and Washington
sinking to Cold War lows over the war in Ukraine. Some have been
released in prisoner exchanges. The most recent one included Marc Fogel,
a teacher from Pennsylvania imprisoned in Russia on charges similar to
those Byers had faced. </p>
<p>Fogel was detained in 2021 when traveling to Russia to work at a
school and handed a 14-year sentence for having what his family and
supporters said was medically prescribed marijuana. He was released and
brought back to the U.S. earlier this month in a swap that saw Alexander
Vinnik, a Russian cryptocurrency expert who faced Bitcoin fraud charges
in the U.S., returned to Russia. </p>
<p>The release of Fogel and Byers come as tensions between Russia and
the U.S. appear to ease. </p>
<p>President Donald Trump on Wednesday upended three years of U.S.
policy toward Ukraine and Russia, saying he and Russia’s President
Vladimir Putin had agreed to begin negotiations on ending the conflict
following a lengthy direct phone call.</p>

benchmarks trade mixed as investors continue to eye Trump</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Tokyo — Global shares traded mixed on Monday as investors continued
to watch economic data and policy moves from U.S. President Donald
Trump, as both are likely to impact upcoming central bank moves.</p>
<p>France’s CAC 40 dipped nearly 0.1% in early trading to 8,171.59,
while Germany’s DAX added 0.4% to 22,560.00. Britain’s FTSE 100 edged up
0.1% to 8,742.97.</p>
<p>U.S. markets are closed on Monday for a holiday.</p>
<p>In Asia, Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 rose in early trading after the
Cabinet Office reported that the economy grew at a better-than-expected
annual rate of 2.8% in October-December, underlined by steady exports
and moderate consumption. But the benchmark quickly fell back and then
recovered to be little changed, finishing up less than 0.1% at
39,174.25.</p>
<p>On a quarter-to-quarter basis, the world’s fourth-largest economy
grew 0.7% for its third straight quarter of growth. Japan marked its
fourth straight year of expansion, eking out 0.1% growth last year in
seasonally adjusted real gross domestic product, which measures the
value of a nation’s products and services.</p>
<p>In other regional markets, Australia’s S&amp;P/ASX 200 slipped 0.2%
to 8,537.10. South Korea’s Kospi surged 0.8% to 2,610.42. Hong Kong’s
Hang Seng reversed course, to slip less than 0.1% to 22,616.23, while
the Shanghai Composite added 0.3% to 3,355.83.</p>
<p>Markets around the world are nervously watching what upward pressure
may come from tariffs that Trump has announced recently. But analysts
now think Trump may ultimately avoid triggering a punishing global trade
war.</p>
<p>His most recent tariff announcement, for example, won’t take full
effect for at least several weeks. That leaves time for Washington and
other countries to negotiate.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve’s goal, as well as that of the Bank of Japan, is
to keep inflation at 2%.</p>
<p>In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude added 28 cents to $71.02 a
barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, rose 34 cents to $75.08
a barrel.</p>
<p>In currency trading, the U.S. dollar declined to 151.90 Japanese yen
from 152.25 yen. The euro cost $1.0472, down from $1.0495.</p>

id="life-threatening-cold-hits-parts-of-us-following-deadly-weekend-flooding">‘Life-threatening
cold’ hits parts of US following deadly weekend flooding</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BISMARCK, N.D. — Harsh cold descended on the nation’s midsection
Monday as a polar vortex gripped the Rockies and Northern Plains on the
heels of weekend storms that pummeled the Eastern U.S. with floods,
killing at least 14 people.</p>
<p>The National Weather Service warned of “life-threatening cold” as
wind chills dropped to minus 51 Celsius in parts of North Dakota on
Monday and minus 46 C in parts of Montana. Tuesday morning was forecast
to be even colder.</p>
<p>Extreme cold warnings were issued for an 11-state swath of the U.S.
stretching from the Canadian border to Oklahoma and central Texas, where
the Arctic front was expected to bring near-record cold temperatures and
wind chills in the single digits by midweek.</p>
<p>Meteorologists had predicted that parts of the U.S. would experience
the 10th and coldest polar vortex event this season. Weather forces in
the Arctic are pushing chilly air that usually stays near the North Pole
into the U.S. and Europe.</p>
<p>Kentucky, Appalachia battered by flooding with at least 13 dead</p>
<p>The death toll in flood-battered Kentucky rose to 12, Gov. Andy
Beshear said Monday night. Two fatal vehicle crashes were connected to
the severe weather, he said, and at least 1,000 people stranded by
floods had to be rescued.</p>
<p>Parts of Kentucky and Tennessee received up to 15 centimeters of rain
as severe storms swept across the South. Water submerged cars and
buildings in Kentucky and mudslides blocked roads in Virginia.</p>
<p>In West Virginia, where there was one confirmed fatality with several
people still missing, Gov. Patrick Morrisey asked President Donald Trump
to issue a disaster declaration for a 13-county region ravaged by
flooding.</p>
<p>Near Logan, West Virginia, authorities responded Monday night to the
spill of acidic water from an abandoned coal mine. The mine blowout
damaged a road, making it impassable, fire officials said.</p>
<p>In Atlanta, a person was killed when a large tree fell on a home
early Sunday.</p>
<p>Flood warnings were extended Monday across most of Kentucky and
portions of Arkansas, Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama, West Virginia,
Virginia and Ohio.</p>
<p>Extreme cold gives the U.S. a taste of the Arctic</p>
<p>This is the coldest month of the year for many locations, and air
temperatures may approach record lows in some areas, said National
Weather Service meteorologist Jason Anglin in Bismarck.</p>
<p>People should cover exposed skin and limit time outside to avoid
frostbite, which can happen in minutes in such low temperatures, Anglin
said. Neighbors should check on each other and those who are vulnerable
and monitor heater vents to make sure they don’t ice up.</p>
<p>Due to the frigid conditions and a “lack of adequate heating fuel,”
North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong on Monday waived hours-of-service
requirements for commercial-vehicle drivers hauling propane and
petroleum products. The waiver is for 30 days.</p>
<p>The cold snap in North Dakota was expected to reduce oil production
by about 5%, or about 50,000 to 80,000 barrels a day — pretty typical
for such conditions, North Dakota Pipeline Authority Director Justin
Kringstad said. It takes about a week once temperatures warm up for
volumes to rebound, he said.</p>
<p>Death can happen in minutes for animals in such cold, said Julie
Schirado, a founder of the Bismarck-based Furry Friends Rockin’ Rescue
animal shelter. The shelter works with other rescues, and uses floor
kennels, heated garages and basements to house animals, she said.</p>
<p>“We see death a lot but when the cold temperatures hit, then it’s
jumped up some more. We lose kittens, puppies that are out in this
weather … Frostbite can be wicked,” Schirado said. People should bring
their pets indoors in extreme cold.</p>
<p>At the Dakota Zoo in Bismarck, which closed last weekend due to cold,
critters such as bison, elk and bighorn sheep don’t mind the
temperatures as they munch food to stay warm and have shelters to enter,
Director Terry Lincoln said. And staff are still out, breaking through
ice for their water, he said.</p>
<p>Lincoln, who lives at the zoo, said he walked to his office on Monday
morning “and I had an ice-cream headache halfway there. You know it’s
cold when you have an ice cream headache without eating ice cream.”</p>

<h2 id="rubio-in-saudi-arabia-for-talks-on-fate-of-gaza">Rubio in Saudi
Arabia for talks on fate of Gaza</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio was in Saudi Arabia on Monday to
discuss the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas and the fate of the Gaza
Strip if the war is ended.</p>
<p>The new top U.S. diplomat met with both Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed
bin Salman and Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan.</p>
<p>Their talks came after U.S. President Donald Trump’s call to move 2.3
million Palestinians out of Gaza into neighboring countries, with the
United States then redeveloping the narrow territory along the
Mediterranean Sea and taking ownership of it, a plan Saudi Arabia and
other Arab nations oppose.</p>
<p>Rubio and the crown prince “underscored the importance of an
arrangement for Gaza that contributes to regional security,” State
Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said after the two officials met. She
did not mention any discussion of the Trump proposal.</p>
<p>Bruce said the two officials “reaffirmed their commitment to
implementing the ceasefire in Gaza and ensuring that Hamas releases all
hostages, including American citizens.”</p>
<p>Arab nations, including Saudi Arabia, oppose Trump’s plan and
continue to support the creation of an independent Palestinian state,
including Gaza, to exist alongside Israel. For years, that also has been
the U.S. stance but now seemingly is at odds with any call for U.S.
ownership of the territory and removal of the Palestinians with no right
for them to return once it is redeveloped.</p>
<p>As such, Rubio has said Arab countries opposed to Trump’s Gaza
proposal should offer their own alternative suggestions on how to
rebuild the territory that has been decimated by 15 months of fighting
between Israel and Hamas militants. The warring sides are now in a
six-week truce that is tenuously holding but set to end in two
weeks.</p>
<p>Terms for the second phase of the ceasefire have yet to be
reached.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Israeli military said Monday its forces will remain in
five strategic locations in southern Lebanon near the border after
Tuesday’s deadline for their withdrawal under a ceasefire with the
Hezbollah militant group. The move came as the region marked 500 days of
unrest linked to the war in the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>Lebanon’s government and Hezbollah are opposed to any further delay
in the Israeli troop withdrawal, which had already been postponed for
three weeks.</p>
<p>Earlier Monday, an Israeli drone attack struck a car in Lebanon’s
southern port city of Sidon, the deepest attack inside Lebanese
territory since the ceasefire took effect. Israel said it targeted
Muhammad Shaheen, the head of Hamas’ operations in Lebanon. Footage
circulating online showed a car engulfed in flames.</p>
<p>Trump’s Gaza takeover plan would seemingly eliminate his hopes of
getting Saudi Arabia to normalize ties with Israel, which Saudi
officials have said will not happen unless there is a pathway for a
Palestinian state.</p>
<p>The United States fully endorsed Israel’s war aims in Gaza on Sunday,
with Rubio saying that Hamas “must be eradicated” and “cannot continue
as a military or government force.”</p>
<p>Rubio told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a stop in
Jerusalem that “as long as [Hamas] stands as a force that can govern or
as a force that can administer or as a force that can threaten by use of
violence, peace becomes impossible.”</p>
<p>Echoing Trump, the Israeli leader said “the gates of hell would be
open” if Hamas does not release dozens of remaining hostages abducted in
its Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war.</p>
<p>Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist group, freed three hostages on
Saturday in exchange for nearly 400 Palestinians who had been jailed in
Israel. But the militants continue to hold dozens of hostages they
captured in the terror attack that killed 1,200 people.</p>
<p>Israel’s counteroffensive during the war with Hamas has killed more
than 48,200 Palestinians, according to the territory’s Health Ministry,
which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. Israel,
without offering evidence, said it has killed over 17,000 militants.</p>
<p>The tentative second phase of the ceasefire plan calls for Hamas to
release dozens of remaining hostages in exchange for more Palestinian
prisoners, the drafting of a permanent truce and the withdrawal of
Israeli forces. But the detailed terms of the deal have yet to be
negotiated.</p>
<p>During his tour of the region, Rubio was not scheduled to meet with
any Palestinian officials.</p>
<p>Egypt says it is hosting an Arab summit on Feb. 27 and is working
with other countries on a counterproposal that would allow for Gaza to
be rebuilt without removing its population. Human rights groups say the
expulsion of Palestinians would likely violate international law.</p>
<p>Egypt has warned that any mass influx of Palestinians from Gaza would
undermine its nearly half-century-old peace treaty with Israel, a
cornerstone of American influence in the region.</p>

Reuters.</p>

urges US to ‘correct its mistakes’ after State Department removes Taiwan
web reference</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BEIJING/TAIPEI — China on Monday urged the United States to “correct
its mistakes” after the U.S. State Department removed previous wording
on its website about not supporting Taiwan independence, which it said
was part of a routine update.</p>
<p>The fact sheet on Taiwan, updated last week, retains Washington’s
opposition to unilateral change from either Taiwan or from China, which
claims the democratically governed island as its own.</p>
<p>But as well as dropping the phrase “we do not support Taiwan
independence,” the page added a reference to Taiwan’s cooperation with a
Pentagon technology and semiconductor development project and says the
U.S. will support Taiwan’s membership in international organizations
“where applicable.”</p>
<p>Beijing regularly denounces any international recognition of Taiwan
or contact between Taiwanese and foreign officials, viewing it as
encouraging Taiwan’s separate status from China.</p>
<p>The update to the website came roughly three weeks after U.S.
President Donald Trump was sworn in to his second term in the White
House.</p>
<p>Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun
said the revisions for Taiwan on the U.S. State Department’s website
were a big step backwards and “sends a seriously wrong message to Taiwan
independence separatist forces.”</p>
<p>“This is yet another example of the United States’ stubborn adherence
to the erroneous policy of ‘using Taiwan to suppress China’. We urge the
United States side to immediately rectify its mistakes,” Guo said.</p>
<p>The United States, like most countries, has no formal diplomatic ties
with Taiwan but is its strongest international backer, bound by law to
provide the island with the means to defend itself.</p>
<p>“As is routine, the fact sheet was updated to inform the general
public about our unofficial relationship with Taiwan,” a State
Department spokesperson said in an email sent late Sunday Taiwan time
responding to questions on the updated website wording.</p>
<p>“The United States remains committed to its one China policy,” the
spokesperson said, referring to Washington officially taking no position
on Taiwan’s sovereignty and only acknowledging China’s position on the
subject.</p>
<p>“The United States is committed to preserving peace and stability in
the Taiwan Strait,” the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>“We oppose any unilateral changes to the status quo from either side.
We support cross-Strait dialog, and we expect cross-Strait differences
to be resolved by peaceful means, free from coercion, in a manner
acceptable to people on both sides of the Strait.”</p>
<p>On Sunday, Taiwan Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung expressed his
appreciation for what he called the “support and positive stance on
U.S.-Taiwan relations.”</p>
<p>Taiwan’s government rejects Beijing’s sovereignty claims, saying that
only the island’s people can decide their future.</p>
<p>Taiwan says it is already an independent country called the Republic
of China, its official name. The Republican government fled to Taiwan in
1949 after losing a civil war with Mao Zedong’s communists, who set up
the People’s Republic of China.</p>

Simon, Sabrina Carpenter open ‘Saturday Night Live’ 50th anniversary
celebration</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Paul Simon and Sabrina Carpenter opened the 50th
anniversary special celebrating “Saturday Night Live” with a duet of his
song “Homeward Bound.”</p>
<p>The 83-year-old Simon has been a constant on “SNL” since its earliest
episodes in 1975 and performed on the first show after the 9/11 attack.
He was joined by the 25-year-old pop sensation of the moment,
Carpenter.</p>
<p>“I sang this song with George Harrison on ‘Saturday Night Live’ in
1976,” Simon said.</p>
<p>“I was not born then,” Carpenter said, getting a laugh. “And neither
were my parents,” she added, getting a bigger laugh.</p>
<p>Fifty seasons of “Saturday Night Live” sketches, songs and special
guests are being celebrated for the special’s landmark anniversary in a
Sunday night special.</p>
<p>The pop culture juggernaut has launched the careers of generations of
comedians, from Bill Murray to Eddie Murphy and Tina Fey to Kristen
Wiig.</p>
<p>Many of those stars were on hand for “SNL50: The Anniversary
Celebration,” airing live from New York, of course.</p>
<p>“I grew up with the show, you know, and I was born in 1971, and it’s
lived with me my whole life,” Amy Poehler, who was a cast member from
2001 to 2008,” said on Sunday ahead of the show’s start. “We have a show
to do in just under two hours, and being back is an amazing
privilege.”</p>
<p>The three-hour extravaganza comes after months of celebrations of
“Saturday Night Live,” which premiered Oct. 11, 1975, with an original
cast that included John Belushi, Chevy Chase and Gilda Radner.</p>
<p>“After the original cast, we were just going, Those guys just did it
all for us,” Adam Sandler, a cast member from 1990-1995, said before the
show. “They crushed it. We watched them at home. They made their movies.
We worshiped their movies. And that’s all. What we wanted to do is just
kind of continue that sort of stuff.”</p>
<p>It’s become appointment television over the years as the show has
skewered presidents, politics and pop culture and been a platform for
the biggest musical stars of the moment. As streaming has altered
television viewing, “SNL” sketches, host monologues and short comedy
films remain popular on social media and routinely rack up millions of
views on YouTube.</p>
<p>While NBC has revealed some of the stars expected to appear, many of
the special’s moments, cameos and music performances remain a
surprise.</p>
<p>On Sunday, NBC announced more guest appearances including Julia
Louis-Dreyfus, Leslie Jones, Billy Crystal, Cher, Mike Myers and Alec
Baldwin, who holds the title of the person who’s hosted “SNL” the most
times.</p>

administration turns to US Supreme Court in bid to fire agency head</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>President Donald Trump’s administration has asked the U.S. Supreme
Court to intervene in its bid to fire the head of an independent U.S.
agency that protects government whistleblowers, bringing its first legal
battle involving Trump’s actions to the nation’s highest judicial body
since he took office in January.</p>
<p>The Justice Department asked the court to immediately lift a federal
judge’s Feb. 12 order that temporarily blocked Trump’s removal of
Hampton Dellinger as the head of the Office of Special Counsel while
litigation continues in the dispute, according to a copy of the filing
reviewed by Reuters. The case has not yet been docketed by the
court.</p>
<p>The federal judge’s action blocking the termination is an
“unprecedented assault on the separation of powers,” Acting Solicitor
General Sarah Harris said in the filing.</p>
<p>“This court should not allow lower courts to seize executive power by
dictating to the President how long he must continue employing an agency
head against his will,” Harris wrote.</p>
<p>Appointed by former President Joe Biden, Dellinger’s five-year term
was set to expire in 2029. He sued after receiving an email on Feb. 7
informing him that Trump had fired him from the watchdog role,
“effective immediately.”</p>
<p>Dellinger’s lawsuit said Trump exceeded his power in purporting to
fire him, given that federal law permits removal only for “inefficiency,
neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.”</p>
<p>The Special Counsel’s “ability to protect the civil service and
investigate alleged misconduct is needed now more than ever,”
Dellinger’s lawsuit said. “Over the preceding three weeks, an
unprecedented number of federal employees with civil service protections
have been terminated without cause.”</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson in Washington, D.C. issued a
temporary restraining order on Feb. 12, restoring Dellinger to his
position pending a further, preliminary order.</p>
<p>Jackson said Dellinger was likely to prevail in the suit given that
the effort to fire him without identifying any cause “plainly
contravenes” the Special Counsel’s job protections under federal
law.</p>
<p>“This language expresses Congress’s clear intent to ensure the
independence of the Special Counsel and insulate his work from being
buffeted by the winds of political change,” Jackson wrote in the
order.</p>
<p>The District of Columbia U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out the
administration’s appeal in a 2-1 decision on Saturday, saying it was
premature, given that Jackson’s order was only temporary.</p>
<p>The Special Counsel Office allows whistleblowers to make disclosures
about alleged misconduct within federal agencies and investigates
complaints of retaliation. It also enforces a U.S. law known as the
Hatch Act that limits political participation by federal employees.</p>
<p>The move to fire Dellinger was the latest by the Trump administration
to expel officials who investigate wrongdoing within the federal
government. Trump last month fired 17 inspectors general who serve as
independent watchdogs within their agencies, without providing a
reason.</p>

race to discover depth of ocean damage from Los Angeles wildfires</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Los Angeles — On a recent Sunday, Tracy Quinn drove down the Pacific
Coast Highway to assess damage wrought upon the coastline by the
Palisades Fire.</p>
<p>The water line was darkened by ash. Burnt remnants of washing
machines and dryers and metal appliances were strewn about the
shoreline. Sludge carpeted the water’s edge. Waves during high tide
lapped onto charred homes, pulling debris and potentially toxic ash into
the ocean as they receded.</p>
<p>“It was just heartbreaking,” said Quinn, president and CEO of the
environmental group Heal the Bay, whose team has reported ash and debris
some 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of the Palisades burn area west of
Los Angeles.</p>
<p>As crews work to remove potentially hundreds of thousands of tons of
hazardous materials from the Los Angeles wildfires, researchers and
officials are trying to understand how the fires on land have impacted
the sea. The Palisades and Eaton fires scorched thousands of homes,
businesses, cars and electronics, turning everyday items into hazardous
ash made of pesticides, asbestos, plastics, lead, heavy metals and
more.</p>
<p>Since much of it could end up in the Pacific Ocean, there are
concerns and many unknowns about how the fires could affect life under
the sea.</p>
<p>“We haven’t seen a concentration of homes and buildings burned so
close to the water,” Quinn said.</p>
<p>Fire debris and potentially toxic ash could make the water unsafe for
surfers and swimmers, especially after rainfall that can transport
chemicals, trash and other hazards into the sea. Longer term, scientists
worry if and how charred urban contaminants will affect the food
supply.</p>
<p>The atmospheric river and mudslides that pummeled the Los Angeles
region last week exacerbated some of those fears.</p>
<p>When the fires broke out in January, one of Mara Dias’ first concerns
was ocean water contamination. Strong winds were carrying smoke and ash
far beyond the blazes before settling at sea, said the water quality
manager for the Surfrider Foundation, an environmental nonprofit.</p>
<p>Scientists on board a research vessel during the fires detected ash
and waste on the water as far as 100 miles (161 kilometers) offshore,
said marine ecologist Julie Dinasquet with the University of California,
San Diego’s Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Things like twigs and
shard. They described the smell as electronics burning, she recalled,
“not like a nice campfire.”</p>
<p>Runoff from rain also is a huge and immediate concern. Rainfall picks
up contaminants and trash while flushing toward the sea through a
network of drains and rivers. That runoff could contain “a lot of
nutrients, nitrogen and phosphate that end up in the ash of the burn
material that can get into the water,” said Dias, as well as “heavy
metals, something called PAHs, which are given off when you burn
different types of fuel.”</p>
<p>Mudslides and debris flows in the Palisades Fire burn zone also can
dump more hazardous waste into the ocean. After fires, the soil in burn
scars is less able to absorb rainfall and can develop a layer that
repels water from the remains of seared organic material. When there is
less organic material to hold the soil in place, the risks of mudslides
and debris flows increase.</p>
<p>Los Angeles County officials, with help from other agencies, have set
thousands of feet of concrete barriers, sandbags, silt socks and more to
prevent debris from reaching beaches. The LA County Board of Supervisors
also recently passed a motion seeking state and federal help to expand
beach clean ups, prepare for storm runoff and test ocean water for
potential toxins and chemicals, among other things.</p>
<p>Beyond the usual samples, state water officials and others are
testing for total and dissolved metals such as arsenic, lead and
aluminum and volatile organic compounds.</p>
<p>They also are sampling for microplastics, polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons, or PAHs, that are harmful to human and aquatic life, and
polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, a group of man-made chemicals shown
to cause cancer in animals and other serious health effects. Now banned
from being manufactured, they were used in products like pigments,
paints and electrical equipment.</p>
<p>County public health officials said chemical tests of water samples
last month did not raise health concerns, so they downgraded one beach
closure to an ocean water advisory. Beachgoers were still advised to
stay out of the water.</p>
<p>Dinasquet and colleagues are working to understand how far
potentially toxic ash and debris dispersed across the ocean, how deep
and how fast they sunk and, over time, where it ends up.</p>
<p>Forest fires can deposit important nutrients like iron and nitrogen
into the ocean ecosystem, boosting the growth of phytoplankton, which
can create a positive, cascading effect across the ecosystem. But the
potentially toxic ash from urban coastal fires could have dire
consequences, Dinasquet said.</p>
<p>“Reports are already showing that there was a lot of lead and
asbestos in the ash,” she added. “This is really bad for people so it’s
probably also very bad for the marine organisms.”</p>

Presidents Day: How it evolved from reverence to retail</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Norfolk, Virginia — Like the other Founding Fathers, George
Washington was uneasy about the idea of publicly celebrating his life.
He was the first leader of a new republic, not a king.</p>
<p>And yet the United States will once again commemorate its first
president Monday, 293 years after he was born.</p>
<p>The meaning of Presidents Day has changed dramatically, from being
mostly unremarkable and filled with work for Washington in the 1700s to
the bonanza of consumerism it has become today. For some historians, the
holiday has lost all discernible meaning.</p>
<p>Historian Alexis Coe, author of “You Never Forget Your First: A
Biography of George Washington,” has said she thinks about Presidents
Day in much the same way as the towering monument in D.C. bearing his
name.</p>
<p>“It’s supposed to be about Washington, but can you really point to
anything that looks or sounds like him?” she remarked in an interview
with The Associated Press in 2024. “Jefferson and Lincoln are presented
as people with limbs and noses and words associated with their
memorials. And he’s just a giant, granite point. He has been sanded down
to have absolutely no identifiable features.”</p>
<p>Here is a look at how things have evolved:</p>
<p>Washington’s birthdays were celebrated, sometimes</p>
<p>Washington was born Feb. 22, 1732, on Popes Creek Plantation near the
Potomac River in Virginia.</p>
<p>Technically, though, he was born Feb. 11 under the ancient Julian
calendar, which was still in use for the first 20 years of his life. The
Gregorian calendar, intended to more accurately mark the solar year, was
adopted in 1752, adding 11 days.</p>
<p>Either way, Washington paid little attention to his birthday,
according to Mountvernon.org, the website of the organization that
manages his estate. Surviving records make no mention of observances at
Mount Vernon, while his diary shows he was often hard at work.</p>
<p>“If he had it his way, he would be at home with his family,” Coe
said. “Maybe some beloved nieces and nephews (and friend) Marquis de
Lafayette would be ideal. And Martha’s recipe for an indulgent cake. But
that’s about it.”</p>
<p>Washington’s birthday was celebrated by his peers in government when
he was president, mostly.</p>
<p>Congress voted during his first two terms to take a short
commemorative break each year, with one exception, his last birthday in
office, Coe said. By then, Washington was less popular, partisanship was
rampant, and many members of his original Cabinet were gone, including
Thomas Jefferson.</p>
<p>“One way to show their disdain for his Federalist policies was to
keep working through his birthday,” Coe said.</p>
<p>The Library of Congress does note a French military officer, the
Comte de Rochambeau, threw a ball celebrating Washington’s 50th birthday
in 1782.</p>
<p>After his death, a market for memorabilia is born</p>
<p>Washington was very aware of his inaugural role as president and its
distinction from the British crown. He didn’t want to be honored like a
king, Seth Bruggeman, a history professor at Temple University in
Philadelphia, told the AP last year.</p>
<p>Still, he said, a market for Washington memorabilia sprang up almost
immediately after his death in 1799 at age 67, with people snapping up
pottery and reproductions of etchings portraying him as a divine figure
going off into heaven.</p>
<p>“Even in that early moment, Americans kind of conflated consumerism
with patriotic memory,” said Bruggeman, whose books include “Here,
George Washington Was Born: Memory, Material Culture, and the Public
History of a National Monument.”</p>
<p>Making it official with parades and festivals</p>
<p>It wasn’t until 1832, the centennial of his birth, that Congress
established a committee to arrange national “parades, orations and
festivals,” according to the Congressional Research Service.</p>
<p>Only in 1879 was his birthday formally made into a legal holiday for
federal employees in the District of Columbia.</p>
<p>The official designation for the holiday is Washington’s Birthday,
although it has come to be known informally as Presidents Day. Arguments
have been made to honor President Lincoln as well because his birth date
falls nearby, on Feb. 12.</p>
<p>A small number of states, including Illinois, observe Lincoln’s
birthday as a public holiday, according to the Library of Congress. And
some commemorate both Lincoln and Washington on Presidents Day.</p>
<p>But on the federal level, the day is still officially Washington’s
Birthday.</p>
<p>A shift to consumerism</p>
<p>By the late 1960s, Washington’s Birthday was one of nine federal
holidays that fell on specific dates on different days of the week,
according to a 2004 article in the National Archives’ Prologue
magazine.</p>
<p>Congress voted to move some of those to Mondays, following concerns
that were in part about absenteeism among government workers when a
holiday fell midweek. But lawmakers also noted clear benefits to the
economy, including boosts in retail sales and travel on three-day
weekends.</p>
<p>The Uniform Monday Holiday Act took effect in 1971, moving Presidents
Day to the third Monday in February. Sales campaigns soared, historian
C. L. Arbelbide wrote in Prologue.</p>
<p>Bruggeman said Washington and the other Founding Fathers “would have
been deeply worried” by how the holiday became taken over by commercial
and private interests.</p>
<p>“They were very nervous about corporations,” Bruggeman said. “It
wasn’t that they forbade them. But they saw corporations as like little
republics that potentially threatened the power of The Republic.”</p>
<p>Coe, who is also a fellow at the Washington think tank New America,
said by now the day is devoid of recognizable traditions.</p>
<p>“There’s no moment of reflection,” Coe said. Given today’s widespread
cynicism toward the office, she added, that sort of reflection “would
probably be a good idea.”</p>

plays down immediate breakthrough on Russia-Ukraine peace</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Top U.S. officials headed Sunday to Saudi Arabia for talks with
Russian diplomats in the coming days on ending Moscow’s three-year war
on Ukraine, but Secretary of State Marco Rubio downplayed prospects for
an immediate breakthrough.</p>
<p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin agreed
during an hour-long call last week to the immediate start of peace
negotiations, but Rubio told CBS’s “Face the Nation” in an interview
aired Sunday, “A process towards peace is not a one- meeting thing.”</p>
<p>“We’ll see in the coming days and weeks if Vladimir Putin is
interested in negotiating an end to the war in Ukraine in a way that is
sustainable and fair,” Rubio said.</p>
<p>Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, and U.S. national security
adviser Mike Waltz said they were headed to Riyadh for the talks, while
a Ukrainian minister says that an official delegation has arrived there
in preparation for a possible visit by Ukrainian President Volodymyr
Zelenskyy.</p>
<p>The shape of the talks remained uncertain.</p>
<p>Rubio said he wasn’t even sure who Moscow was sending. “Nothing’s
been finalized yet,” he said, adding that the hope was for an opening
for a broad conversation that “would include Ukraine and would involve
the end of the war.”</p>
<p>Trump’s call with Putin blindsided NATO allies as well as Kyiv, with
Zelenskyy later saying that there should be “no decisions about Ukraine
without Ukraine.”</p>
<p>Whatever occurs this week in Saudi Arabia, Rubio said that once “real
negotiations” begin, then Ukraine “will have to be involved.”</p>
<p>Hours before European leaders meet in Paris to address Washington’s
policy shift on the war in Ukraine, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer
wrote in the Daily Telegraph on Sunday that he was ready to send British
troops to Ukraine as part of any postwar peacekeeping force.</p>
<p>“I do not say that lightly,” he wrote. “I feel very deeply the
responsibility that comes with potentially putting British servicemen
and women in harm’s way.”</p>
<p>Starmer said securing a lasting peace in Ukraine was essential to
deter Russian President Putin from further aggression.</p>
<p>His article was meant to show the U.S. that European nations should
have a role in discussions on ending the nearly 3-year-old conflict.</p>
<p>French President Emmanuel Macron also warned that European countries
should do more for their collective security, as talks between the
United States and Russia loom.</p>
<p>The U.K. premier is due to join leaders from Germany, Italy, Poland,
Spain, the Netherlands and Denmark at the Paris meeting on Monday, just
days ahead of the anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on
Feb. 24, 2022.</p>
<p>In an interview with NBC’s “Meet the Press” that aired Sunday,
Ukrainian President Zelenskyy said, “I will never accept any decisions
between the United States and Russia about Ukraine. Never. The war in
Ukraine is against us, and it is our human losses.”</p>
<p>Zelenskyy said he told Trump in a call they had last week that Putin
is only pretending to want peace.</p>
<p>“I said that he is a liar. And [Trump] said, ‘I think my feeling is
that he’s ready for these negotiations.’ And I said to him, ‘No, he’s a
liar. He doesn’t want any peace.’”</p>
<p>The United States has been Ukraine’s biggest arms supplier during the
conflict, but Trump has wavered on continued support and declined during
a political debate last year to say that he wants Ukraine to win.</p>
<p>Zelenskyy said that without continued U.S. military support,
“Probably it will be very, very, very difficult” to defeat Russia. “And
of course, in all the difficult situations, you have a chance. But we
will have low chance – low chance to survive without support of the
United States.”</p>
<p>Russia now controls about 20% of Ukraine’s internationally recognized
territory, including the Crimean Peninsula it unilaterally annexed in
2014 and the eastern portion of Ukraine pro-Moscow separatists captured
after that and since the full-scale February 2022 Russian invasion.</p>

id="captain-america-brave-new-world-soars-toward-100-million-holiday-weekend">‘Captain
America: Brave New World’ soars toward $100 million holiday weekend</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>“Captain America: Brave New World” infused some blockbuster cash into
the North American box office, bringing in $88.5 million in ticket sales
over the weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday. The Walt Disney
Co. release is by far the biggest opener of 2025 and the company
predicts it will hit $100 million domestically and $192.4 globally by
the end of Monday’s Presidents’ Day holiday.</p>
<p>It’s Marvel’s first major release since “Deadpool &amp; Wolverine”
broke records last summer and re-energized a Marvel fanbase that some
worried was weakening after the poor showing for “The Marvels.”</p>
<p>Playing in 4,105 locations in the U.S. and Canada, “Brave New World”
is also a major transition for the “Captain America” brand: Anointing
Anthony Mackie’s Sam Wilson as the new Cap, officially taking over from
Chris Evans, who played the character for almost a decade. Harrison Ford
co-stars as the U.S. president who transforms into the Red Hulk.</p>
<p>But “Brave New World,” directed by Julius Onah, had a bit of a
handicap going into the weekend: Poor reviews, though superhero movies
can soar without the stamp of approval from critics. The film is
currently sitting at 51% “rotten” on Rotten Tomatoes. It’s not the worst
in the Marvel Cinematic Universe — “Eternals” has a 47% rating and
“Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania” has a 46% — but the latest film is
on the very low end of the spectrum.</p>
<p>In his review for The Associated Press, Mark Kennedy wrote that it
is, “a highly processed, empty calorie, regret-later candy of a
movie.”</p>
<p>Audiences were more generous in their opinions. The “verified
audience score” from Rotten Tomatoes was 80% and its CinemaScore was a
B-. Exit polls showed that men made up 63% of the opening weekend
audience.</p>
<p>The bar for biggest opening of the year wasn’t terribly high: “Dog
Man” held the title for two weeks with its $36 million launch.</p>
<p>And “Brave New World’s” showing is the middle range for an MCU film.
Not accounting for inflation, it sits between “Guardians of the Galaxy”
and “Thor: The Dark World.”</p>
<p>It also cost significantly less than many of the big budget Marvel
movies, with a reported production price tag of $180 million, excluding
the millions spent on marketing and promotion.</p>
<p>After only one Marvel movie in 2024, “Brave New World” is the first
of three major theatrical releases set for 2025. It is to be followed by
“Thunderbolts(asterisk)” in May and “The Fantastic Four: First Steps” in
July.</p>
<p>“The superhero genre has taken a hit over the past few years, but
audiences still have a huge interest in seeing them on the big screen,”
said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore.</p>
<p>Second place at this week’s box office went to “Paddington in Peru,”
the third installment in the beloved franchise, which finally opened in
North America this weekend. Released by Sony, it earned an estimated $13
million and should hit $16 million by Monday. The StudioCanal film
opened in the United Kingdom in early November 2024 and went into the
weekend with $104 million from its international run.</p>
<p>Dougal Wilson took over directing duties for Paul King for this film,
which also recast Emily Mortimer as Mrs. Brown, originally played by
Sally Hawkins. The other main cast, including Ben Whishaw as Paddinton’s
voice, remained intact.</p>
<p>Sony and Screen Gems’ slasher “Heart Eyes” landed in third place with
$10 million, up 20% from its opening last weekend. Fourth place went to
“Dog Man” with $9.7 million.</p>
<p>The Chinese blockbuster “Ne Zha 2” rounded out the top five. It
opened on 660 screens in North America and made $7.2 million. Overall,
the box office is up 20% from last year.</p>
<p>This weekend also saw the release of a new “Bridget Jones” movie,
subtitled “Mad About the Boy,” which went straight to Universal’s
streaming service Peacock, forgoing theaters in the U.S. In the U.K. and
Ireland, it made an estimated $14.9 million, outgrossing “Captain
America: Brave New World.” Universal Pictures International reported
$32.3 million in grosses from all 70 territories.</p>
<p>The final domestic figures will be released Tuesday. Estimated ticket
sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according
to Comscore:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>“Captain America: Brave New World,” $88.5 million.</p></li>

<h2 id="us-border-czar-unhappy-with-pace-of-migrant-arrests">US ‘border
czar’ unhappy with pace of migrant arrests</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President Donald Trump’s “border czar” said Sunday he is “not
happy” with the number of undocumented migrants being arrested by
immigration agents and deported to their home countries. </p>
<p>Tom Homan told CNN’s “State of the Union” show that 14,000 migrants
had been arrested since Trump was inaugurated January 20, but said,
“We’ve got to do a lot more.” </p>
<p>Many of those arrested have been flown back to their native lands or
sent to the prison on the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba,
while some have been released to live in the United States pending court
proceedings. </p>
<p>The U.S. estimates that 11 million undocumented migrants are living
in the U.S., with Trump pledging during his 2024 run for the presidency
to find and deport “millions” of them. Officials say that the first
arrests have targeted migrants convicted of crimes in the U.S. but that
anyone living in the country without proper immigration documentation
could be targeted. </p>
<p>Homan said the number being deported is “a lot higher” than under the
former administration of President Joe Biden, but added, “We’ve got to
get the targeting and production up. It’s hard work.” </p>
<p>The Trump administration has tapped law enforcement personnel from
several U.S. agencies to augment those at the U.S. Immigration and
Customs Enforcement agency, which normally controls migration
issues. </p>
<p>In the first days of the Trump administration, there were hundreds of
migrant arrests daily and there still are, but just not as many. </p>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security reported about 800 arrests a day
in late January, topping out at 1,179 on Jan. 26. The figure was fewer
than 600 a day in the first two weeks of February. </p>
<p>The Trump administration had set a goal of 1,200 to 1,500 arrests a
day.</p>

<p>Trump administration moves quickly with mass deportation plans</p>
<p>Since taking office, U.S. President Donald Trump has declared illegal
immigration a national emergency. The Trump administration ramped up its
mass deportation efforts, expanding the use of expedited removal and
using Guantanamo Bay as a detention site for certain migrants. The moves
have raised concerns among immigration advocates, who argue that the
policies lack transparency and could violate due process rights. VOA’s
immigration reporter, Aline Barros, reports.</p>
<p>US fires 20 immigration judges from backlogged courts</p>
<p>The administration of President Donald Trump has fired 20 immigration
judges without explanation, a union official said Saturday amid sweeping
moves to shrink the size of the federal government. On Friday, 13 judges
who had yet to be sworn in and five assistant chief immigration judges
were dismissed without notice, said Matthew Biggs, president of the
International Federation of Professional &amp; Technical Engineers,
which represents federal workers. Two other judges were fired under
similar circumstances last week. The Associated Press reports.</p>
<p>With doors closed to US, asylum-seekers turn to a new life in
Mexico</p>

<h2 id="rubio-hamas-must-be-eradicated">Rubio: Hamas ‘must be
eradicated’</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The U.S. fully endorsed Israel’s war aims in Gaza on Sunday, with
Secretary of State Marco Rubio saying that Hamas “must be eradicated”
and “cannot continue as a military or government force.”</p>
<p>Rubio met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem
at the start of a regional tour as the first phase of a tenuous
Israel-Hamas ceasefire expires in two weeks, with the second segment yet
to be negotiated.</p>
<p>Rubio, on his first trip to the Middle East as the new top U.S.
diplomat, told Netanyahu that “as long as [Hamas] stands as a force that
can govern or as a force that can administer or as a force that can
threaten by use of violence, peace becomes impossible.”</p>
<p>Rubio is likely to face continued opposition from Arab nations about
U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan to move Palestinians out of Gaza into
neighboring countries and then for Israel to hand over the narrow
territory along the shores of the Mediterranean Sea to the U.S. to own
and redevelop.</p>
<p>While U.S. allies and adversaries alike have assailed Trump’s Gaza
plan, Netanyahu has welcomed it, saying that he and Trump have a “common
strategy” for Gaza’s future.</p>
<p>Echoing Trump, the Israeli leader said “the gates of hell would be
open” if Hamas does not release dozens of remaining hostages abducted in
its Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war.</p>
<p>Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist group, freed three hostages
Saturday in exchange for nearly 400 Palestinians who had been jailed in
Israel. But the militants continue to hold dozens of hostages they
captured in the terror attack that killed 1,200 people.</p>
<p>Israel’s counteroffensive during 15 months of fighting in Gaza has
killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, according to the territory’s
health ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and
civilians. Israel, without proving evidence, says it has killed over
17,000 militants.</p>
<p>Rubio and Netanyahu met as the first phase of the ceasefire nears its
end. In the second phase, the tentative plan calls for Hamas to release
dozens of remaining hostages in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners,
drafting of a permanent truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces. But
the detailed terms of the deal have yet to be negotiated.</p>
<p>The tough U.S. stance aligning with Netanyahu’s position could
complicate efforts to continue talks with Hamas, which, despite
suffering heavy losses in the war, remains intact and in control of
Gaza.</p>
<p>Some of Netanyahu’s supporters in the Israeli government want to
continue the war when the first phase of the ceasefire ends but resuming
it could endanger the lives of the remaining hostages.</p>
<p>Netanyahu has offered Hamas a chance to surrender and send its top
leaders into exile, but Hamas has rejected such a scenario.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, despite the ceasefire largely holding, the Israeli
military said it carried out an airstrike early Sunday on people who
approached its forces in southern Gaza.</p>
<p>The Hamas-run Interior Ministry said the strike killed three of its
policemen while they were securing the entry of aid trucks near Rafah,
on the Egyptian border.</p>
<p>Hamas described the attack as a “serious violation” of the ceasefire
and accused Netanyahu of trying to sabotage the deal.</p>
<p>During his tour of the region, Rubio was not scheduled to meet with
any Palestinian officials.</p>
<p>Egypt says it is hosting an Arab summit on Feb. 27, and is working
with other countries on a counterproposal that would allow for Gaza to
be rebuilt without removing its population. Human rights groups say the
expulsion of Palestinians would likely violate international law.</p>
<p>Arab nations have long called for creation of an independent
Palestinian state to exist alongside Israel, which the U.S. has also
supported. But Netanyahu opposes a two-state solution and U.S. ownership
of Gaza also would likely end the possibility of a Palestinian state
encompassing Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank.</p>
<p>Egypt has warned that any mass influx of Palestinians from Gaza would
undermine its nearly half-century-old peace treaty with Israel, a
cornerstone of American influence in the region.</p>
<p>Rubio is also set to visit the United Arab Emirates and Saudi
Arabia.</p>
<p>The United Arab Emirates was the leading force behind the 2020
Abraham Accords in which four Arab states normalized relations with
Israel during Trump’s first White House term. Trump hopes to expand the
accords to include Saudi Arabia, potentially offering closer U.S.
defense ties, but the kingdom has said it will not normalize relations
with Israel without a pathway to a Palestinian state.</p>

<h2 id="dead-including-8-in-kentucky-in-latest-winter-weather-blast">9
dead, including 8 in Kentucky, in latest winter weather blast</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOUISVILLE, Ky. — At least nine people have died in the most recent
round of harsh weather to pummel the U.S., including eight people in
Kentucky who died as creeks swelled from heavy rain and water covered
roads. </p>
<p>Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said Sunday that hundreds of people
stranded by flooding had to be rescued. </p>
<p>Beshear said many of the deaths, including a mother and 7-year-old
child, were caused by cars getting stuck in high water. </p>
<p>“So folks, stay off the roads right now and stay alive,” he said.
“This is the search and rescue phase, and I am very proud of all the
Kentuckians that are out there responding, putting their lives on the
line.” </p>
<p>Beshear said the storms have knocked out power to about 39,000 homes,
but he warned that harsh winds in some areas could increase
outages. </p>
<p>Much of the U.S. beyond Kentucky faced another round of biting winter
weather. The Northern Plains faced life-threatening cold, and tornado
watches were issued for parts of Georgia and Florida. </p>
<p>Hart County Coroner Tony Roberts said earlier that the mother and
child were swept away Saturday night in the Bonnieville community. In
southeastern Kentucky, a 73-year-old man was found dead in floodwaters
in Clay County, County Emergency Management Deputy Director Revelle
Berry said. </p>
<p>Parts of Kentucky and Tennessee received up to 6 inches 15
centimeters (6 inches) of rain during the weekend storms, said Bob
Oravec, a senior forecaster with the National Weather Service. </p>
<p>“The effects will continue for a while, a lot of swollen streams and
a lot of flooding going on,” Oravec said Sunday. “Any time there’s
flooding, the flooding can last a lot longer than the rain lasts.” </p>
<p>In Atlanta, a person was killed when an “extremely large tree” fell
on a home early Sunday, according to Atlanta Fire Rescue Capt. Scott
Powell. He told reporters that firefighters were dispatched just before
5 a.m. after a 911 call. </p>
<p>Elsewhere, bone-chilling cold is expected for the Northern Plains
with low temperatures into the minus 30s Celsius (minus 30s Fahrenheit)
near the Canadian border. Dangerously cold wind chill temperatures in
the Dakotas and Minnesota of minus 40 Celsius (minus 40 Fahrenheit)
to minus 45.6 Celsius (minus 50 Fahrenheit) are expected. </p>
<p>Heavy snowfall amounts were expected in parts of New England and
northern New York. In some areas, wind gusts could reach about 97 kph
(60 mph) and create “hazardous whiteout conditions,” the NWS said. </p>
<p>Kentucky faces severe flooding </p>
<p>Water submerged cars and buildings in Kentucky and mudslides blocked
roads in Virginia late Saturday into Sunday. Both of the states were
under flood warnings, along with Tennessee and Arkansas. The National
Weather Service warned residents to stay off the roads. </p>
<p>Chilly temperatures replaced the heavy rains with snow early Sunday
in parts of Kentucky. </p>
<p>The Kentucky River Medical Center in the city of Jackson said closed
its emergency department and was transferring all patients to two other
hospitals in the region. The hospital said it would re-evaluate
conditions Sunday morning to determine when it can safely reopen. The
north fork of the Kentucky River was forecast to crest nearly 4.3 meters
(14 feet) above flood stage that afternoon, the weather service
said. </p>
<p>Photos posted by authorities and residents on social media showed
cars and buildings underwater in south-central and eastern Kentucky. In
Buchanan County, Virginia, the sheriff’s office said multiple roads were
blocked by mudslides. </p>
<p>The Simpson County Office of Emergency Management in Kentucky said
authorities performed several rescues from stalled-out vehicles in
floodwaters. </p>
<p>“Stay home if you can,” the office said on Facebook. </p>
<p>New England faces snow, then sleet </p>
<p>Meanwhile heavy snow was expected to blanket much of New England and
then transition to sleet. </p>
<p>Oravec said Sunday that snowfall in the region was relatively light,
due to the freezing rain and sleet mix. </p>
<p>Snow and arctic temperatures swept much of the Midwest and Upper
Plains on Saturday, covering roads in eastern Nebraska, northern Iowa
and much of Wisconsin. Winter weather advisories were issued for parts
of those states and Michigan, with up to 10.6 centimeters (4 inches) of
snow predicted throughout Iowa, southern Wisconsin and most of Michigan
by Sunday evening. </p>
<p>Frigid polar vortex </p>
<p>Meteorologists said the U.S. was about to get its 10th and coldest
polar vortex stretching event this season, with the northern Rockies and
northern Plains first in line. Weather forces in the Arctic are
combining to push the chilly air that usually stays near the North Pole
into the U.S. and Europe. </p>
<p>In Denver, where temperatures were expected to dip as low as minus 10
degrees Celsius (14 degrees Fahrenheit) over the weekend, the city
opened shelters for those living on the streets.</p>

id="white-south-africans-gather-in-support-of-trump-his-claims-they-are-victims-of-racism">White
South Africans gather in support of Trump, his claims they are victims
of racism</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PRETORIA, SOUTH AFRICA — Some white South Africans showed support for
President Donald Trump on Saturday and gathered at the U.S. Embassy in
Pretoria to claim they are victims of racism by their own
government.</p>
<p>Hundreds of protesters held placards that read “Thank God for
President Trump” and displayed other messages criticizing what they see
as racist laws instituted by the South African government that
discriminate against the white minority.</p>
<p>Many were from the Afrikaner community that Trump focused on in an
executive order a week ago that cut aid and assistance to the Black-led
South African government. In the order, Trump said South Africa’s
Afrikaners, who are descendants of mainly Dutch colonial settlers, were
being targeted by a new law that allows the government to expropriate
private land. </p>
<p>The South African government has denied its new law is tied to race
and says Trump’s claims over the country and the law have been full of
misinformation and distortions. </p>
<p>Trump said land was being expropriated from Afrikaners — which the
order referred to as “racially disfavored landowners” — when no land has
been taken under the law. Trump also announced a plan to offer
Afrikaners refugee status in the U.S. They are only one part of South
Africa’s white minority. </p>
<p>In a speech to Parliament this week, South African President Cyril
Ramaphosa said the forced removal of any people from their land will
never be allowed in South Africa again after millions of Blacks were
dispossessed of property under the apartheid system of white minority
rule and hundreds of years of colonialism before that. </p>
<p>“The people of this country know the pain of forced removals,”
Ramaphosa said. He said the land law does not allow any arbitrary taking
of land and only refers to land that can be redistributed for the public
good. </p>
<p>The Trump administration’s criticism and punishment of South Africa
has elevated a long-standing dilemma in the country over moves to
address the wrongs of centuries of white minority rule that oppressed
the Black majority. </p>
<p>According to the government, the land law aims to fairly address the
inequality that the majority of farmland in South Africa is owned by
whites, even though they make up just 7% of the country’s
population. </p>
<p>White protesters on Saturday held banners referencing the
expropriation law but also other affirmative action policies put in
place by the government since the end of apartheid in 1994 to advance
opportunities for Blacks. Those laws, known as Black Economic
Empowerment, have been a source of frustration for some white
people.</p>
<p>Influential Trump adviser Elon Musk — who was raised in South Africa
— has also criticized South Africa’s government and claimed it is
anti-white for years, although some have questioned his motivations. He
has recently failed to get a license for his Starlink satellite internet
service in South Africa because it doesn’t meet the country’s
affirmative action criteria.</p>
<p>While race has long framed South African politics, the country has
been largely successful in reconciling its racially diverse people in
the years after apartheid. The current government is made up of a
coalition of 10 Black-led and white-led political parties that are
working together.</p>

id="breakfast-is-booming-at-us-restaurants.-is-it-also-contributing-to-high-egg-prices">Breakfast
is booming at US restaurants. Is it also contributing to high egg
prices?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>It’s a chicken-and-egg problem: Restaurants are struggling with
record-high U.S. egg prices, but their omelets, scrambles and huevos
rancheros may be part of the problem.</p>
<p>Breakfast is booming at U.S. eateries. First Watch, a restaurant
chain that serves breakfast, brunch and lunch, nearly quadrupled its
locations over the past decade to 570. Eggs Up Grill has 90 restaurants
in nine southern states, up from 26 in 2018. Florida-based Another
Broken Egg Café celebrated its 100th restaurant last year.</p>
<p>Fast-food chains are also adding more breakfast items. Starbucks,
which launched egg bites in 2017, now has a breakfast menu with 12
separate items containing eggs. Wendy’s reintroduced breakfast in 2020
and offers 10 items with eggs.</p>
<p>Reviews website Yelp said 6,421 breakfast and brunch businesses
opened in the United States last year, 23% more than in 2019.</p>
<p>In normal times, producers could meet the demand for all those eggs.
But an ongoing bird flu outbreak, which so far has forced farms to
slaughter nearly 159 million chickens, turkeys and other birds —
including nearly 47 million since the start of December — is making
supplies scarcer and pushing up prices. In January, the average price of
eggs in the U.S. hit a record $4.95 per dozen.</p>
<p>The percentage of eggs that go to U.S. restaurants versus other
places, like grocery stores or food manufacturers, is not publicly
available. U.S. Foods, a restaurant supplier, and Cal-Maine Foods, the
largest U.S. producer of shell eggs, did not respond to The Associated
Press’ requests for comment.</p>
<p>But demand from restaurants is almost certainly growing. Foot traffic
at U.S. restaurants has grown the most since 2019 for morning meals,
2019, according to market research firm Circana. Pre-lunchtime hours
accounted for 21% of total restaurant visits in 2024.</p>
<p>Breakfast sandwiches are the most popular order during morning
visits, Circana said, and 70% of the breakfast sandwiches on U.S. menus
include eggs.</p>
<p>Eggs Up Grill CEO Ricky Richardson said breakfast restaurants took
off after the COVID pandemic because people longed for comfort and
connection. As inflation made food more expensive, customers saw
breakfast and lunch as more affordable options for eating out, he
said.</p>
<p>The growth in restaurant demand reverses a pattern that emerged
during the pandemic, when consumers tried to stock up on eggs for home
use but restaurants needed fewer of them because many of them had to
close for a time, according to Brian Earnest, a lead economist for
animal proteins at CoBank.</p>
<p>U.S. egg consumption declined for more than five decades before
reaching a low of 247 per person in 2008, according to data from the
U.S. Department of Agriculture. As nutritional research and marketing
established eggs as an inexpensive protein source instead of
heart-clogging cholesterol bombs, per capita consumption of egg products
grew to the equivalent of 292 fresh eggs in 2019, the data shows.</p>
<p>“Consumers think eggs are really fresh, so if you’re making something
with eggs, you know it’s fresh,” Earnest said.</p>
<p>Before the pandemic reduced demand and bird flu outbreaks impacted
supplies, the USDA had forecast that Americans would continue eating
more eggs. By 2023, the most recent year for which annual data is
available, they were down to 249 eggs per person.</p>
<p>Other trends have impacted the economics of eggs. To address animal
rights concerns, McDonald’s and some other companies have switched to
100% cage-free eggs, which limits the sources they will buy from. Ten
states, including California and Colorado, have passed laws restricting
egg sales to products from cage-free environments.</p>
<p>“It makes the market much more complicated than it was 20 years ago,”
Earnest said.</p>
<p>The higher prices are hitting restaurants hard. Wholesale egg prices
hit a national average of $7.34 per dozen last week, according to the
U.S. Department of Agriculture. That was 51% higher than at the
beginning of the year. Wholesale costs may be higher than retail prices
since grocers use eggs as a loss leader to get customers in the
door.</p>
<p>Some chains, like Waffle House, have added a surcharge to help offset
the cost of eggs. Others may turn to egg substitutes like tapioca starch
for some recipes or cut egg dishes from the menu, said Phil Kafarakis,
the president and CEO of the International Foodservice Manufacturers
Association.</p>
<p>First Watch President and CEO Chris Tomasso said eggs are critical
for the chain’s brand and are found in the majority of its offerings,
whether at the center of the plate or as an ingredient in batters. So
far, he said, the company has been able to obtain the eggs it needs and
isn’t charging extra for them.</p>
<p>First Watch is also increasing portion sizes for non-egg items like
meat and potatoes, Tomasso said.</p>
<p>Richardson, of Eggs Up Grill, said he recently met with franchisees
to discuss adding a surcharge but they decided against it.</p>
<p>“Eggs have always been and will continue to be an important part of
American diets,” Richardson said.</p>

id="us-man-sues-travel-company-after-hippo-kills-wife-on-zambia-trip">US
man sues travel company after hippo kills wife on Zambia trip</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A New Jersey man whose wife was killed in a horrific hippopotamus
attack last year during a safari in Africa is suing the U.S. company
that arranged the trip, alleging it failed to ensure their safety and
did not adequately screen and supervise the tour guides.</p>
<p>Craig and Lisa Manders were on a guided walk in Zambia in June when a
hippo charged out of the water, grabbed Lisa Manders by its mouth and
crushed her head and body with its bite, according to the lawsuit filed
against African Portfolio, a safari tour company based in Greenwich,
Connecticut. The company denies the lawsuit’s allegations.</p>
<p>The lawsuit, filed Feb. 5 in Stamford, Connecticut, alleges that as a
horrified Craig Manders watched the attack, the tour guides — including
at least one armed with a rifle — walked away without helping the
couple. Lisa Manders, 70, suffered catastrophic injuries and died
shortly after, the lawsuit says.</p>
<p>“We’re doing this because this should never have happened,” said Paul
Slager, an attorney who is representing Craig Manders with his law
partner, Nicole Coates. “There are basic safety standards that
businesses are expected to follow, and that includes people in the
safari tour industry. And those were not followed, and the consequences
here were absolutely devastating.”</p>
<p>Slager said the lawsuit seeks monetary damages that have not yet been
determined, as well as accountability for Lisa Manders’ death and
keeping others safe in the future. He said Craig Manders was not giving
interviews.</p>
<p>The Manderses, of Cranford, New Jersey, were on a special anniversary
trip and it was their first time in Africa, Slager said. Lisa Manders
had worked in the financial industry for over 40 years and loved
cooking, traveling and visiting New York City, where she was born in
Queens in 1953, according to her obituary. The couple had three children
and a granddaughter.</p>
<p>The company’s lawyer, Rodney Gould, said it was not negligent or
reckless in connection with Lisa Manders’ death. He said African
Portfolio only arranged the couple’s lodging and the owners of the
lodging, Chiawa Safaris in Zambia, provided the tour guides.</p>
<p>“It’s a horrible tragedy when somebody goes on one of these trips and
is injured or killed. It’s awful,” Gould said. “I think it’s important
to understand what African Portfolio’s role in this is. It’s a tour
operator. It arranges trips. It puts together the pieces.”</p>
<p>He added, “My client didn’t conduct the safari. It arranged it. It
booked all the components.”</p>
<p>Gould also said the company was not negligent in vetting Chiawa,
because it has an excellent reputation. He said African Portfolio will
either ask a judge to dismiss the lawsuit or request that the matter go
to arbitration, which was a condition of an agreement the Manderses
signed for the trip.</p>
<p>In a statement, African Portfolio did not directly address the
lawsuit. It said Chiawa arranged the walking safari and guests were
accompanied by an experienced and highly trained guide, a ranger and an
armed National Park scout. It said Chiawa told authorities that safety
measures were implemented before the attack and “repeated warnings” were
issued to guests to return to the safety of the vehicle “during the
incident.”</p>
<p>Asked whether the guests were warned about the hippo before the
attack, African Portfolio said in an email only that “the statement is
an accurate reflection of the events as we understand them.” Gould
declined to comment.</p>
<p>The company also said its founder flew to Zambia immediately after
the attack and joined Chiawa’s owner in ensuring that “everything
possible was being done to support the family and all those involved.
Our thoughts and prayers continue to be with the family, and everyone
else involved in this tragic incident.”</p>
<p>The lawsuit, which does not mention Chiawa, says African safaris are
“inherently dangerous activities” because of the unpredictability and
sometime aggressive nature of wild animals, and they require careful
planning and execution to be completed safely. It says African Portfolio
vetted and oversaw the tour guides and vouched that they were competent,
qualified and trained to keep people safe.</p>
<p>The suit alleges that African Portfolio “encouraged and/or permitted”
the Manderses to be exposed to an “avoidable and highly dangerous
encounter with a dangerous hippopotamus in the Zambian wilderness.” It
also accuses the company of failing to provide safe conditions during
the wilderness walk and failing to ensure that the tour guides were
adequately selected, screened, supervised and trained to provide a safe
experience.</p>
<p>African Portfolio also failed to take adequate steps to protect the
Manderses before and during the attack, the suit alleges.</p>
<p>Hippos are the world’s second-largest land mammals after elephants,
measuring about 3.5 meters long and about 1.5 meters tall, according to
International Fund for Animal Welfare. The average male hippo weighs
about 3,200 kilograms.</p>
<p>Hippos are known to be territorial and aggressive at times. A year
before Lisa Manders died, seven people were killed in the southern
African nation of Malawi when a hippo charged into a canoe and capsized
it on a river. Estimates of how many people are killed by hippos each
year vary, with lower figures beginning at around 500.</p>
<p>Lisa Manders suffered “significant premorbid fear and emotional pain,
suffering and mental anguish” before her death, the suit says. Craig
Manders suffered severe and debilitating emotional and psychological
injuries that have made it difficult for him to cope with daily
routines, it says.</p>
<p>The lawsuit is seeking damages on allegations of negligence and
recklessness.</p>
<p>“He’s suing both for the loss of his wife and the impact that has on
him and his life,” Slager said. “And he also has a claim for having
witnessed what happened to her, having seen the attack, which is
unthinkable. It’s unimaginable.”</p>

lost in US disasters find way home with help from people who care</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — Hollowed-out homes. Cars entombed by mud. Unpeopled
roads. Belongings reduced to dirt and debris. </p>
<p>It all took a toll on Taylor Schenker. </p>
<p>After Hurricane Helene last September, Schenker was upset by the
deluge of images of Asheville, North Carolina. “This storm has taken so
much,” she said, “and it’s so jarring to see the photos of the horrible
devastation.”</p>
<p>So less than a week after the storm, she set out to do something
about the wide-scale loss. </p>
<p>While helping a friend search for belongings cast downriver, she
stumbled on a handful of photos of strangers — mud-caked, curled up in
tree branches and stuck under river rocks. The images captured family
reunions, newborn babies, weddings, birthday parties, beloved pets and
school portraits. </p>
<p>“These tiny photos had been through so much and miraculously had
washed up and were in decent enough condition that you could see what
they were,” said Schenker, 27. “It stuck with me.” </p>
<p>To reclaim the search phrase “photos from Helene,” she created an
Instagram for “something positive, which is reuniting people with their
memories.” She set up a post-office box, linked up with a volunteer
search and rescue crew, and ultimately uncovered more than 500 photos —
or what she calls “little needles in a haystack.” </p>
<p>When Schenker made her first match, she got chills. </p>
<p>Then, sitting in her car, she cried. </p>
<p>Photos found amid muck </p>
<p>We hold onto photos to keep memories alive — of people, places and
moments that might otherwise fade. Or sometimes are ripped away
abruptly. </p>
<p>Schenker has since returned more than 70 such images. A stack of them
were hand-delivered to Mary Moss, whose car was destroyed by an uprooted
tree as she and her husband evacuated the Asheville home where they had
lived for almost 40 years. </p>
<p>“It was really kind of overwhelming at first when she handed me those
pictures. I just couldn’t even speak,” Moss said. “You don’t expect
something as fragile as photos to be retrieved.” </p>
<p>Months later, they’ve received some FEMA assistance and found a
temporary home, which they’re gradually furnishing with church
donations. But some things are irreplaceable. </p>
<p>“This is not really about losing the home and all the material stuff
in there. But what’s been devastating is that that was everything we had
of Tommy,” she said of their son who died at age 12 from a genetic
disorder. “It’s those memories and the little things, the photos, that
you can’t replace.” </p>
<p>As Schenker later understood it, “When they lost their home, they
lost virtually all proof that this child existed.” </p>
<p>“It is such a privilege to look into the intimate moments of people’s
lives,” she said. “They’ve literally lost everything and they can’t ever
recreate those childhood photos.” </p>
<p>In photos Schenker found nearly 3 miles (5 kilometers) from the Moss
family home, Tommy is seen as a 2-year-old dressed like an angel for a
Christmas pageant. In another, he is wearing a toddler-sized suit; in
yet another, he’s playing at daycare alongside his younger brother
Dallas. </p>
<p>“It is just breathtaking,” Moss said. “This is one thing that the
river didn’t get to take — or didn’t get to keep.” </p>
<p>Smoke, water, ash, soot</p>
<p>More than 2,000 miles (3,200 kilometers) away, in the Altadena
foothills of Los Angeles, Claire Schwartz, 31, began to collect photos
with a similar idea: Find images, post them online, try to unite them
with their owners. </p>
<p>After the Eaton fire, but before the first rain, she panicked. When
rain and ash mix, it makes lye, which destroys photos. “Someone has to
do this ASAP,” she remembers thinking to herself. “And I realized it had
to be me — because nobody else was doing it.” </p>
<p>Luca Ackerman, a New York-based photo conservator, cautions that mold
can start to develop 48 hours after water exposure. To slow the
deterioration process, he freezes such prints — and advised to not wipe
off any surfaces, which can drag toxic oils across the print, “driving
particles deeper into the material.” Some photos are so brittle, too,
that when touched they may disintegrate. </p>
<p>In the wake of disasters, conservators like Ackerman are deployed in
volunteer rotations with the National Heritage Responders. Rapidly, he
trains art handlers and museum staff how to treat sensitive materials,
whether they are damaged by smoke, water, ash or soot. </p>
<p>Wearing a respirator, nitrile gloves and booties, Schwartz swiftly
set out to salvage photos — finding them alongside pages from yearbooks,
sheet music, and children’s art in nearby parks, neighbors’ front yards
and a golf course. </p>
<p>“The wind has scattered everything, everywhere. And trash is mixed in
with precious mementos everywhere you look,” she said. “It’s just
absolutely bizarre how stuff clumps together and travels as a
unit.” </p>
<p>Finding the photographed people</p>
<p>Normally, a local library would take in found items, but the Altadena
Public Library, along with more than 9,000 homes, burned to the ground.
Librarians are redirecting residents who have found photos to
Schwartz. </p>
<p>She adopted parts of her process from what she learned as an archival
intern at the Corita Art Center — protecting photos in acid-free,
glassine envelopes and storing them in a waterproof box in a
temperature-controlled room with good air circulation. </p>
<p>Last week, she made her first match: disposable camera photos of
teenagers, smiling, in prom dresses and glittering tiaras. The image is
flecked with damage, but all four corners are intact. </p>
<p>“It’s funny — you formulate these ideas of who the person is,”
Schwartz said. “She was kind of exactly what I pictured, just really
friendly and bubbly and lovely — you could tell that just from her
photos.” </p>
<p>Schwartz’s house survived because her neighbors stayed behind to
fight the fire themselves, but the landscape around it — full of
burned-out lots, ghostly palm trees and blackened telephone poles — is
otherworldly and changed. “It looks like the moon. It looks like another
planet. It doesn’t look like home.” </p>
<p>Nearby is Joshua Simpson, a photographer who lost his Altadena home
and studio, along with decades of film negatives, silver gelatin prints
and camera equipment. But something meaningful survived. </p>
<p>“The very first thing we found was this beautiful vintage print of my
mother-in-law holding my wife when she was a newborn baby,” said
Simpson. The black-and-white photo carries an extra layer of poignancy,
as his mother-in-law died just few months ago. “We were both pretty
overjoyed in that moment. It felt a little magical finding that
one.” </p>
<p>Above all, Ackerman said, personal safety comes first. “When you’re
picking up people’s heirlooms or family photographs, that can be
traumatic — even if they’re not yours,” he said. </p>
<p>When people survive catastrophic events such as wildfires or
hurricanes, and are left to cope with loss, they may express a wide
range of emotions — from overwhelmed to outraged to numb sometimes all
at once. Tragedies, though, can also strengthen the ties in communities,
and people like Schenker and Schwartz are Exhibits A and B. </p>
<p>“Disasters like this really bring out the best in people,” Moss said.
“You know, I can laugh or I can cry about it — and I choose to laugh
about it. Fortunately, we didn’t lose the most important thing. That’s
lives.”</p>

anthem boos in stormy US-Canada ice hockey clash</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MONTREAL — Three fights in the first nine seconds and a chorus of
deafening boos for the US national anthem marked a stormy ice hockey
clash between the United States and Canada in Montreal on Saturday.</p>
<p>An emotionally charged showdown between the star-studded lineups of
the North American rivals – which comes against a backdrop of political
tension between the two neighboring countries – erupted into violence
from the opening puck drop at Montreal’s Bell Centre.</p>
<p>The U.S. squad clinched a spot in the 4 Nations Face-Off final
Thursday at Boston with a 3-1 victory, but the result was almost a
footnote to the mayhem that marked the start of a game played before a
fiercely partisan Canadian crowd.</p>
<p>With Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in the crowd, home fans
booed The Star-Spangled Banner before the game, catcalls that have
become a regular feature at NHL and NBA games in Canada since U.S.
President Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs on Canadian goods
crossing U.S. borders.</p>
<p>Then came three fights in nine seconds.</p>
<p>“I just think it’s very indicative of what this means to the
players,” U.S. coach Mike Sullivan said. “There’s two teams out there
that are very competitive, that have a ton of pride for their respective
teams and their countries.</p>
<p>“For me, when you have an investment in trying to win like the way
that it occurred – I think that’s an indication of it. What an
incredible hockey game.”</p>
<p>Canada coach Jon Cooper, the two-time Stanley Cup champion coach for
Tampa Bay who will guide the Canadian 2026 Olympic team, said the melee
in the first moments was not prearranged.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t planned,” Cooper said. “That wasn’t two coaches throwing
guys over and saying ‘This is happening’ – none of that happened. That
was as organic as it gets.”</p>
<p>At the opening puck drop, the gloves came off for real on the ice as
Canada’s Brandon Hagel and Matthew Tkachuk of the United States began
swinging punches as the crowd went wild and teammates skated back to
give the brawlers a clear stage at center ice.</p>
<p>Referees restored order, sent the combatants to the penalty box and
tried to restart the game, only for Canada’s Sam Bennett and Brady
Tkachuk of the Americans to drop their gloves and trade punches until
officials could break them apart, Tkachuk following his brother into the
penalty box.</p>
<p>The game was restarted but only got to nine seconds before American
J.T. Miller and Canada’s Colton Parayko began the third and final
fight.</p>
<p>‘Jacked up’</p>
<p>Asked about U.S. players having agreed on the fight-filled start
beforehand on a group chat, Sullivan said he was unaware of such a
move.</p>
<p>“These guys care very much about winning,” he said. “Brady and
Matthew, they play the game with so much emotion – and they’re leaders
in so many ways.</p>
<p>“It’s just an indication of how much these guys care and how bad they
want to win. I was not aware of it. Obviously, there’s a lot of energy
around this game. I knew we were going to be jacked up to play.”</p>
<p>Top NHL players from the United States and Canada had not faced off
against each other for their home nations since the 2016 World Cup of
Hockey, the league’s best traditionally skipping the world championships
and the NHL having chosen not to send its players to the 2018
PyeongChang or 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.</p>
<p>“It was probably I guess 10 years of no international hockey exhaled
in a minute and a half,” Cooper said.</p>
<p>The intense drama continued once the game began in earnest with
Canada going ahead on Connor McDavid’s goal 5:31 into the first
period.</p>
<p>But the Americans equalized on Jake Guentzel’s goal at 10:15 of the
first period and the U.S. went ahead to stay on Dylan Larkin’s tally at
13:33 of the second period. The Americans sealed the triumph on
Guentzel’s empty-net goal with 1:19 remaining in the third period.</p>

South Korea, Japan reaffirm pledge to seek denuclearization of North
Korea</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MUNICH — The United States, Japan and South Korea renewed their
“resolute” pledge to seek the “complete denuclearization” of North
Korea, according to a joint statement from the three allies released
Saturday.</p>
<p>The statement came after new U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio held
his first meetings with South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul and
Japan’s top diplomat Takeshi Iwaya on the sidelines of the Munich
Security Conference on Saturday.</p>
<p>“The Secretary and Foreign Ministers reaffirmed their resolute
commitment to the complete denuclearization of the Democratic People’s
Republic of Korea (DPRK) in accordance with the United Nations Security
Council Resolutions (UNSCRs),” it said.</p>
<p>“They expressed their serious concerns over and the need to address
together the DPRK’s nuclear and missile programs, malicious cyber
activities including cryptocurrency thefts, and increasing military
cooperation with Russia,” it added.</p>
<p>The three sent a “strong warning” that they “will not tolerate any
provocations or threats to their homelands,” and vowed to maintain and
strengthen international sanctions against Pyongyang.</p>
<p>They also said they were committed to “the immediate resolution of
the issues of abductees, detainees, and unrepatriated prisoners of war
as well as the issue of separated families.”</p>
<p>Largely cut off from the world diplomatically and economically, and
under a bevy of sanctions, North Korea with its ongoing nuclear weapons
program has been a major thorn in the side of the United States for
years.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump, who had a rare series of meetings with Kim
Jong Un during his first term in office, has said he will reach out
again to the North Korean leader, calling Kim a “smart guy.”</p>
<p>Despite Trump’s diplomatic overtures, North Korea said in January
that its nuclear program would continue “indefinitely.”</p>
<p>Pyongyang also said earlier this month it would not tolerate any
“provocation” by the United States after Rubio called it a “rogue state”
in a radio interview.</p>
<p>It has also slammed a visit by a U.S. nuclear submarine to a naval
base in South Korea this month as a “hostile military act.”</p>
<p>A summit between Trump and Kim in Hanoi collapsed in 2019 over talks
on sanctions relief and what Pyongyang would be willing to give up in
return.</p>

<h2 id="us-fires-20-immigration-judges-from-backlogged-courts">US fires
20 immigration judges from backlogged courts</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA — The administration of U.S. President Donald
Trump has fired 20 immigration judges without explanation, a union
official said Saturday amid sweeping moves to shrink the size of the
federal government. </p>
<p>On Friday, 13 judges who had yet to be sworn in and five assistant
chief immigration judges were dismissed without notice, said Matthew
Biggs, president of the International Federation of Professional &amp;
Technical Engineers, which represents federal workers. Two other judges
were fired under similar circumstances in the last week. </p>
<p>It was unclear if they would be replaced. The U.S. Justice
Department’s Executive Office for Immigration Review, which runs the
courts and oversees its roughly 700 judges, did not immediately respond
to a request for comment Saturday. </p>
<p>Immigration courts are backlogged with more than 3.7 million cases,
according to Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access
Clearinghouse. Applicants can wait years for their asylum case to be
decided. There is support across the political spectrum for more judges
and support staff, though the first Trump administration also pressured
some judges to decide cases more quickly. </p>
<p>The Trump administration earlier replaced five top court officials,
including Mary Cheng, the agency’s acting director. Sirce Owen, the
current leader and previously an appellate immigration judge, has issued
a slew of new instructions, many reversing policies of the Biden
administration. </p>
<p>Last month, the Justice Department halted financial support for
nongovernmental organizations to provide information and guidance to
people facing deportation but restored funding after a coalition of
nonprofit groups filed a federal lawsuit. </p>
<p>The firings touch on two top Trump priorities: mass deportations and
shrinking the size of the federal government. On Thursday, it ordered
agencies to lay off nearly all probationary employees who had not yet
gained civil service protection, potentially affecting hundreds of
thousands of workers. Probationary workers generally have less than a
year on the job.</p>

East faces flooding as snow forecast for Northeast, cold in Midwest</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY — Much of the Eastern U.S. endured a renewed
round of harsh, soggy weather Saturday, with snowstorms predicted in the
Northeast and heavy winds bringing the threat of tornadoes to the
Mississippi Valley.</p>
<p>The states of Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia and Arkansas were
under flood warnings, and people were warned by the National Weather
Service to stay off the roads. Parts of western Kentucky could face up
to 20.3 centimeters of rain.</p>
<p>Governor Andy Beshear preemptively declared a state of emergency in
Kentucky, where flash flooding was expected into Sunday.</p>
<p>“We want to specifically put assets in places that flood and have
flooded in the past,” Beshear said on social media.</p>
<p>Photos posted by authorities and users on social media showed cars
and buildings underwater in Warren County, Kentucky, and in Buchanan
County, Virginia, where the sheriff’s office said multiple roads were
blocked by mudslides.</p>
<p>The Simpson County Office of Emergency Management in Kentucky said
authorities performed several rescues from stalled-out vehicles in
floodwaters.</p>
<p>“Stay home if you can,” the office said on Facebook.</p>
<p>Flash flooding was possible in the Mississippi, Tennessee and Ohio
valleys, the weather service said. In Tennessee, flash flood warnings
were issued for much of the middle of the state through the evening.</p>
<p>The National Weather Service called the expected rain a “major,
potentially historic, flash flood event.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile heavy snow was expected to blanket much of New England and
then transition to sleet, making travel nearly impossible. The heaviest
accumulations — possibly 30.5 centimeters or more — were expected in
upstate New York and portions of northern New England.</p>
<p>“Ice accumulations up to a quarter inch (half a centimeter) are
forecast for some areas, making driving conditions dangerous. Heavy
icing in some locations may result in downed trees and power outages,”
the weather service warned.</p>
<p>Snow and arctic temperatures swept much of the Midwest and Upper
Plains, covering roads in eastern Nebraska, northern Iowa and much of
Wisconsin. Winter weather advisories were issued for parts of those
states and Michigan, with up to 10.6 centimeters of snow predicted
throughout Iowa, southern Wisconsin and most of Michigan by Sunday
evening.</p>
<p>Frigid polar vortex</p>
<p>Meteorologists said the U.S. was about to get its 10th and coldest
polar vortex stretching event this season, with the northern Rockies and
northern Plains first in line. Weather forces in the Arctic are
combining to push the chilly air that usually stays near the North Pole
into the U.S. and Europe.</p>
<p>In Denver, where temperatures were expected to dip as low as minus 10
degrees Celsius over the weekend, the city opened shelters for those
living on the streets.</p>
<p>Forecasters reported 2.5 centimeters of snow falling every hour just
north of Denver.</p>
<p>The weather service also warned of extreme cold in the Upper Plains
over the coming days, with wind chills ranging from minus 34 degree
Celsius to as low as minus 51 degrees Celsius in parts of western
Montana, North Dakota, northern South Dakota and western Minnesota.
People in those areas were urged to stay indoors and make provisions to
shelter livestock and other animals.</p>
<p>California struggles with mudslides</p>
<p>Dry weather returned to Southern California after the strongest storm
of the year. But the risk of rockslides and mudslides on
wildfire-scarred hillsides continued because dangerous slides can strike
even after rain stops, particularly in areas where vegetation that helps
keep soil anchored has burned away.</p>
<p>Water, debris and boulders rushed down the mountain in the city of
Sierra Madre on Thursday night, trapping at least one car in the mud and
damaging several homes with mud and debris. Bulldozers cleaned up
mud-covered streets in the city of 10,000 people.</p>
<p>A storm in the Sierra Nevada dumped 1.8 meters of snow over 36 hours.
Two Mammoth Mountain ski patrol workers were caught in an avalanche
during avalanche mitigation work Friday morning, the resort said in a
Facebook post. One was extracted and was responsive, while the other was
taken to a hospital with serious injuries.</p>

id="irs-to-lay-off-thousands-of-probationary-workers-in-tax-season">IRS
to lay off thousands of probationary workers in tax season</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will lay off
thousands of probationary workers in the middle of tax season, according
to two sources familiar with the agency’s plans, and the cuts could
happen as soon as next week.</p>
<p>The Trump administration intensified sweeping efforts to shrink the
size of the federal workforce. It is doing it by ordering agencies to
lay off nearly all probationary employees who had not yet gained civil
service protection.</p>
<p>It’s unclear how many IRS workers will be affected.</p>
<p>Previously, the administration announced a plan to offer buyouts to
almost all federal employees through a “deferred resignation program” to
quickly reduce the government workforce. The program deadline was
Feb. 6, and administration officials said employees who accept will be
able to stop working while still collecting a paycheck until
Sept. 30.</p>
<p>However, IRS employees involved in the 2025 tax season were told they
will not be allowed to accept a buyout offer from the Trump
administration until after the taxpayer filing deadline, according to a
letter sent recently to IRS employees.</p>
<p>It is unclear how many workers will be impacted by the layoff
announcement plan. Representatives from the U.S. Treasury and IRS did
not respond to Associated Press requests for comment.</p>
<p>Jan. 27 was the official start date of the 2025 tax season, and the
IRS expects more than 140 million tax returns to be filed by the April
15 deadline. The Biden administration invested heavily in the IRS
through an $80 billion infusion of funds in Democrats’ Inflation
Reduction Act, which included plans to hire tens of thousands of new
employees to help with customer service and enforcement as well as new
technology to update the tax collection agency.</p>
<p>Republicans have been successful at clawing back that money, and
billionaire Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency have
called for the U.S. to “delete entire agencies” from the federal
government as part of his plan to radically cut spending and restructure
its priorities.</p>
<p>Elected officials are trying to fight against DOGE plans. Attorneys
general from 14 states challenged the authority of DOGE to access
sensitive government data and exercise “virtually unchecked power” in a
lawsuit filed Thursday.</p>
<p>The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Washington, says the actions
taken by Musk at the helm of DOGE can only be taken by a nominated and
Senate-confirmed official. It cites constitutional provisions that
delineate the powers of Congress and the president.</p>
