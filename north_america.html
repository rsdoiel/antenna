leaders congratulate Trump but wonder if he can end Mideast wars as
promised</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>AMMAN, JORDAN — Arab leaders quickly congratulated Donald Trump on
his U.S. presidential election victory. Some are hopeful he could bring
an end to conflicts raging in the Middle East while others are looking
for a stronger stance against Iran.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia’s King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman,
United Arab Emirates leaders, and Qatar’s emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad,
all congratulated Donald Trump on his win, saying strengthening
strategic partnerships is important.</p>
<p>Dania Koleilat Khatib, president of the Research Center for
Cooperation and Peace Building in Beirut, told VOA that during the
election, Trump emphasized personal ties with such leaders compared to
what she called Biden’s more transactional approach.</p>
<p>Khatib said Arab leaders want Trump to end war in Gaza and
Lebanon.</p>
<p>“One of his main campaign promises was to end the war in Gaza. But
end it how? Would it end with a Palestinian state? We don’t know,” she
said. “The thing that is worrying is [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin]
Netanyahu attacking Iran. This will be major. Handling Iran will not be
easy for Trump.”</p>
<p>Bin Salman has reiterated that his country would not consider
improving ties with Israel unless the Gaza war ended and a Palestinian
state is established.</p>
<p>Wealthy Gulf states have bolstered ties with Iran and given the
Islamic Republic assurances that they won’t allow Israel to use their
airspace to facilitate attacks on Iran.</p>
<p>In its response to the elections, Iran played down the results,
saying it was ready for confrontation with Israel.</p>
<p>Jordan’s King Abdullah, Egypt’s Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, Lebanon’s
caretaker Prime Minister Najib Makati, who are involved in trying to
negotiate an end to the raging conflicts, also congratulated Trump.</p>
<p>Analyst Osama Al Sharif in Amman said he believes Trump will pressure
Netanyahu to end the conflicts before the presidential inauguration next
year.</p>
<p>“He will boldly tell Netanyahu … to wrap things up before the 20th of
January because those two wars, especially Gaza, have become so toxic
and they have become part of the [President Joe] Biden stigma, which was
also eventually inflicted on [Vice President Kamala] Harris,” he
said.</p>
<p>“Trump doesn’t need to start his first day at the office with more
news of children getting killed and hospitals being blown up.”</p>
<p>Al Sharif told VOA that Iran will be a big challenge for Trump, who
he says is an “isolationist who wants to extract America from any
conflict.” He predicted Trump may tighten sanctions on Iran.</p>
<p>“More sanctions,” he said. “He may be able to communicate with Tehran
through [Russian President Vladimir] Putin, who is now a very close ally
of the Iranians. That remains to be seen.”</p>
<p>Al Sharif, however, expressed concern that Trump might recognize
Israel’s annexation of most of the West Bank under Israel’s current hard
right government, which he said “would complicate things dramatically”
for the Palestinians and Jordan.</p>

Country’s Biggest CO2 Pipeline Was Just Dealt a Huge Setback</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-06, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NDIzMTI2MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4OTc4NjQwOH0.FDWecnTDCi9lh4tdoAUiHZ3AoEj-2bPyRedvn2jyO9A/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
South Dakota voters have
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/05/us/elections/results-south-dakota-referred-law-21-regulation-for-pipeline-companies.html" target="_blank">rejected</a>
a ballot measure that would have eased the permitting process for a
highly contentious carbon dioxide pipeline. The planned $8 billion
project, developed by Summit Carbon Solutions, would carry CO2 captured
from ethanol plants to sequestration wells in neighboring North Dakota.
But if the company had been banking on legislative relief for its siting
challenges, it will have to figure out a new plan to move forward.
</p>
<p>
Referred Law 21, as the measure was called, was a citizen-led veto
referendum on a bill that passed the South Dakota legislature and was
signed by the governor in March. The bill would have preempted all local
land use regulations and ordinances related to the siting of carbon
dioxide pipelines and other transmission infrastructure, including power
lines. Full authority to permit these projects would have been handed to
the state’s utility commission, an elected three-member body that
regulates utilities.
</p>
<p>
Summit Carbon Solutions is trying to build what would be the largest
pipeline designed to carry carbon dioxide in the United States. From a
climate perspective, putting debates on land use and local control
aside, the calculus of the project is complicated.
</p>
<p>
Ethanol refineries are ripe for carbon capture — they emit a very pure
stream of CO2 that is technologically easy to capture, and it’s better
that it be buried underground than dumped in the atmosphere. But the
long term prospects for ethanol in a low-carbon future are murky at
best, and investing $8 billion in carbon capture and pipeline
infrastructure could help justify its continued use over other,
potentially better solutions. Though it’s clear electric cars will
eventually crowd out ethanol from the passenger vehicle fuel market,
some advocate for the industry to pivot to aviation fuel.
</p>
<p>
The pipeline faces opposition throughout the Midwest from a diverse
coalition of stakeholders, including landowners in the pipeline’s path,
environmental groups like the Sierra Club that oppose carbon capture in
general, and Republican legislators who question the project’s merits on
the grounds that climate change is merely a “hypothesis.” Though CO2
pipelines generally have a good track record for safety, a
<a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/05/21/1172679786/carbon-capture-carbon-dioxide-pipeline" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>high-profile
rupture in Mississippi in 2020</u></a>, which sent 45 people to the
hospital, has also amplified concerns.
</p>
<p>
At least five municipalities in South Dakota have passed rules governing
the siting of the pipeline, Chase Jensen, a senior organizer for the
environmental nonprofit Dakota Rural Action told me on a call last week.
For example, Minnehaha County, the home of Sioux Falls, adopted setback
rules last year that require pipelines to be laid 330 feet away from
residential areas, businesses, and churches. An ordinance in Lincoln
County requires 1,855 feet, and prohibits construction on sites of
historical or archeological significance.
</p>
<p>
“Everybody who’s going to make a buck from the future energy transition
is licking their chops at this,” Jensen said of Referred Law 21, which
would have preempted these ordinances. “It’s a lot easier to just make
campaign donations to three public utility commissioners than the
300-plus county commissioners across the state.”
</p>
<p>
The bill signed into law in March was
<a href="https://southdakotasearchlight.com/2024/03/06/legislature-passes-attempted-balance-between-landowners-and-carbon-pipeline-project/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>painted
as a compromise</u></a>. Though it weakened local control, it gave
counties the ability to charge pipeline companies a tax of $1 per linear
foot of pipe installed. It also included a so-called “Landowner Bill of
Rights” that enshrined certain protections like ensuring the pipeline’s
developer is liable for damages caused by the project, and designating a
minimum depth at which the pipeline must be buried.
</p>
<p>
But Jensen and
<a href="https://www.sdpropertyrightslocalcontrol.com/faqs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>others
who opposed</u></a> argued it didn’t offer landowners anything new —
some of its provisions are already afforded by South Dakota law, and
others had already been negotiated with Summit Carbon Solutions. Jensen
pointed out that the utility commission already has the ability to
override local ordinances if it finds them to be overly restrictive.
</p>
<p>
Now, with control over pipeline siting back squarely in the hands of
local authorities, the future of the Summit project in South Dakota is
unclear. The utility commission already rejected the company’s initial
application for construction permits last year; Summit has since altered
its route and reapplied.
</p>
<p>
Martin Lockman, a climate law fellow at Columbia Law School, told me it
was difficult to take away a clear message from the fight, in part
because CO2 pipelines have strange politics. Coalitions for and against
them don’t break down over party lines or traditional groups like
environmentalists versus fossil fuel companies. Some climate advocates,
as well as experts in the U.S. Department of Energy, say we’ll need to
build many thousands of miles of new carbon pipelines in order to help
us sequester carbon captured from industrial facilities and from the
atmosphere.
</p>
<p>
The specific arguments over the Summit project may not apply to projects
proposed elsewhere, Lockman told me, but its fate could still have
ripple effects. “Any kind of high profile failure might make investors a
little bit more leery to participate in this kind of project,” he said.

independence now?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-06, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
The Federal Reserve meets today and tomorrow to determine the future
path of interest rates. The central bank is designed to do its work
insulated from politicians, and its independence from political
pressures is a cornerstone of monetary policy. But a second presidency
of Donald Trump could bring that independence into question. We’ll hear
more. We’ll also discuss the connections between Trump, interest rates
and the deficit.

id="republicans-take-control-of-us-senate-in-tuesday-voting">Republicans
take control of US Senate in Tuesday voting</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Mitch McConnell, the top Republican in the U.S. Senate, said the
incoming Senate Republican majority would be an important guardrail for
the country.</p>
<p>“It’s a good day for the GOP [Republican Party],” McConnell told
reporters Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Republican party won back a majority in the Senate with at least
51 of 100 seats in Tuesday’s election. Control of the House of
Representatives, which is currently held by Republicans, was not yet
decided early Wednesday.</p>
<p>All 435 seats in the House of Representatives were at stake in
elections throughout the United States for new two-year terms, while 34
of the 100 seats in the Senate were contested for new six-year
terms.</p>
<p>Before Election Day, Democrats had narrow control of the Senate and
Republicans of the House. Key Republican victories for Senate seats in
West Virginia and Ohio put them in position to be back in the
majority.</p>
<p>In the House, Republicans held a 220-212 edge, with three vacant
seats going into the election. Control of that chamber has not been
confirmed yet. Control of the House may not be known for several days,
as California has often taken days to count ballots, and recounts and
runoffs of close races can take weeks to resolve.</p>
<p>Political surveys throughout the election campaign have shown voters
— much like in the Kamala Harris-Donald Trump race for the White House —
evenly divided in their political preference for congressional
control.</p>
<p>An October Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 43% of registered voters
would back the Republican House candidate in their district, while 43%
would back the Democratic candidate.</p>
<p>A Republican majority in the U.S. Senate could jeopardize any future
U.S. aid packages to Ukraine to aid its fight against Russia.</p>
<p>McConnell, who has often been at odds with his own party in support
of that aid, reiterated its importance on Wednesday.</p>
<p>“It may seem old-fashioned to some, but I’m still a Reagan Republican
who thinks that America’s role in the world is absolutely indispensable,
even if you’re concerned about cost.”</p>

<h2>
THE TOP FIVE
</h2>
<h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Donald Trump wins 2024 presidential election
</h3>
<p>
Donald Trump has won the 2024 presidential election. Votes are still
being tallied, but he has so far taken the swing states of Pennsylvania,
Georgia, North Carolina, and Wisconsin. At the time of publishing, he
had secured 277 electoral college votes to Vice President Kamala Harris’
224. Republicans also took control of the Senate, but the status of the
House of Representatives remains unclear.
</p>
<p>
The energy and environmental implications of a Trump victory are
profound,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/donald-trump-2024-climate-energy?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--Sdk-WuSHEUY5gFJRtmkHCwsxsLovgLnEhbJR1TCUAgWxAhfN8cRrgo6AV5Y6DMGXb92cz" rel="noopener" target="_self">writes
Heatmap’s Robinson Meyer</a>. He is likely to pull the United States out
of the Paris Agreement, approve a new tranche of liquified natural gas
export terminals, and block and then begin to roll back the
Environmental Protection Agency’s climate rules for power plants, cars,
and light-duty trucks. “Not all of these rollbacks will make themselves
felt at first,” Meyer writes. “The current set of EPA clean car rules,
for instance, apply to vehicles sold through model year 2026. That is
close enough to the present that automakers have already begun to make
the necessary investments to meet those standards. But vehicles sold in
the latter half of this decade will likely face much weaker rules or
none at all.” He may also try to repeal or otherwise hinder the
Inflation Reduction Act, which would set the country and world back in
the fight against climate change. But it would also significantly raise
taxes on energy companies (and automakers) while hurting Trump’s own
voters, as the IRA’s hundreds of billions in investments, which are
largely tax credits, have overwhelmingly flowed to Republican districts.
</p>
<p>
“For every step back that Trump takes on climate policy, China will step
forward and take more of a global leadership role,” Meyer writes. “As
Trump’s White House steers American climate policy for the rest of the
2020s, they will not just be deciding what direction the U.S. will go in
— they will be acting with, or against, the rest of the world.”
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Environmental groups react to Trump win
</h3>
<p>
Reactions to Trump’s victory are trickling in from climate organizations
and analysts. Here are a few:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
“There is no denying that another Trump presidency will stall national
efforts to tackle the climate crisis and protect the environment, but
most U.S. state, local, and private sector leaders are fully committed
to charging ahead. And you can count on a chorus of world leaders
confirming that they won’t turn their back on climate and nature goals.”

Lashof, U.S. Director of the World Resources Institute</a>.
</li>
<li>
“This is a dark day, but despite this election result, momentum is on
our side. The transition away from dirty fossil fuels to affordable
clean energy is already underway. Trump can’t change the reality that an
overwhelming majority of Americans want more clean energy, not more
fossil fuels. Through investments in the Inflation Reduction Act we are
creating millions of new clean energy jobs. Clean energy is already
cheaper in most cases than dirty fossil fuels, and wind and solar now
generate more power in the U.S. than coal.”

tabs on</a> 36 of the most important climate elections, from seats in
the House and Senate down to local ballot measures and attorneys
general. Here’s where some of those stand so far:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Republican Rep. Jen Kiggans</strong> won re-election in
Virginia’s 2nd Congressional District. Kiggans, the vice chair of the
Conservative Climate Caucus and a Trump ally, backed the Default on
America Act to repeal clean energy tax credits and has flip-flopped on
her support of offshore wind.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Democrat Attorney General Josh Stein</strong> won the election
for governor in North Carolina. He had proposed a path to reach carbon
neutrality in the state by 2050 and has a history of taking on polluters
and Big Oil price gougers. His Republican opponent had called climate
change “junk science” and said he’d attempt to block history and science
from being taught in the first through fifth grades.
</li>
<li>
<strong>In Ohio’s Senate race</strong>, MAGA Republican Bernie Moreno
has flipped the seat of three-term Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown. Moreno
has stressed that “we need natural gas, we need oil” rather than “this
move toward windmills, solar panels.”
</li>
<li>
<strong>The race for Pennsylvania’s Senate seat remains a
toss-up</strong> between Democratic incumbent Bob Casey, Jr. and
Republican David McCormick. Few Senate races this year have touched on
climate and energy issues as much as this one, in the country’s
second-largest natural gas-producing state.
</li>
<li>
<strong>In New Mexico, Democrat Rep. Vasquez managed to fend off a
challenge from Republican Yvette Herrell</strong> to hold on to the
state’s 2nd congressional district. The district includes a large swath
of the oil-rich Permian Basin, and Vasquez had walked the line between
promoting wind and solar manufacturing as part of the IRA while also
“looking out for those fossil fuel communities.”
</li>
<li>
<strong>Republican Austin Knudsen will remain Montana’s attorney
general</strong>, beating Democratic challenger Ben Alke. Knudsen leads
the state’s case against the 16 young plaintiffs in <em>Held v.
Montana</em>, who are suing lawmakers for allegedly violating their
right to a “clean and healthful environment” as enshrined in the state’s
constitution.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
In addition, the Republican-backed effort to repeal Washington state’s
new cap and invest program failed; voters in Berkeley rejected a ballot
measure that would have functionally reinstated the city’s
first-in-the-nation prohibition against gas hookups in new buildings;
and California looks likely to pass Proposition 4, which authorizes $10
billion in bonds for water quality, coastal resilience projects,
wildfire prevention, and climate-risk protections.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Trump victory puts Elon Musk in the spotlight

<p>
Donald Trump has ascended to the White House with the assistance of a
strange coalition, which includes Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who is supposedly
going to oversee a new Department of Government Efficiency. In his
victory speech, Trump

a verse to Musk. “A star is born: Elon,” Trump said, praising Musk’s

id="abortion-rights-advocates-win-in-7-states-and-clear-way-to-overturn-missouri-ban-but-lose-in-3">Abortion
rights advocates win in 7 states and clear way to overturn Missouri ban
but lose in 3</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Voters in Missouri cleared the way to undo one of the
nation’s most restrictive abortion bans in one of seven victories for
abortion rights advocates, while Florida, Nebraska and South Dakota
defeated similar constitutional amendments, leaving bans in place. </p>
<p>Abortion rights amendments also passed in Arizona, Colorado, Maryland
and Montana. Nevada voters also approved an amendment, but they’ll need
to pass it again it 2026 for it to take effect. Another that bans
discrimination on the basis of “pregnancy outcomes” prevailed in New
York. </p>
<p>The results include firsts for the abortion landscape, which
underwent a seismic shift in 2022 when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned
Roe v. Wade, a ruling that ended a nationwide right to abortion and
cleared the way for bans to take effect in most Republican-controlled
states. </p>
<p>They also came in the same election that Republican Donald Trump won
the presidency. Among his inconsistent positions on abortion has been an
insistence that it’s an issue best left to the states. Still, the
president can have a major impact on abortion policy through executive
action. </p>
<p>In the meantime, Missouri is positioned to be the first state where a
vote will undo a ban on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with an
amendment that would allow lawmakers to restrict abortions only past the
point of a fetus’ viability — usually considered after 21 weeks,
although there’s no exact defined time frame. </p>
<p>But the ban, and other restrictive laws, are not automatically
repealed. Advocates now have to ask courts to overturn laws to square
with the new amendment. </p>
<p>“Today, Missourians made history and sent a clear message: decisions
around pregnancy, including abortion, birth control, and miscarriage
care are personal and private and should be left up to patients and
their families, not politicians,” Rachel Sweet, campaign manager of
Missourians for Constitutional Freedom, said in a statement. </p>
<p>Roughly half of Missouri’s voters said abortion should be legal in
all or most cases, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 2,200
of the state’s voters. But only about 1 in 10 said abortion should be
illegal in all cases; nearly 4 in 10 said abortion should be illegal in
most cases. </p>
<p>Bans remain in place in three states after votes </p>
<p>Florida, Nebraska and South Dakota became the first states since Roe
was overturned where abortion opponents prevailed on a ballot measure.
Most voters supported the Florida measure, but it fell short of the
required 60% to pass constitutional amendments in the state. Most states
require a simple majority. </p>
<p>The result was a political win for Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican
with a national profile, who had steered state GOP funds to the cause.
His administration has weighed in, too, with a campaign against the
measure, investigators questioning people who signed petitions to add it
to the ballot and threats to TV stations that aired one commercial
supporting it. </p>
<p>Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the national anti-abortion group
SBA Pro-Life America, said in a statement that the result is “a
momentous victory for life in Florida and for our entire country,”
praising DeSantis for leading the charge against the measure. </p>
<p>The defeat makes permanent a shift in the Southern abortion landscape
that began when the state’s six-week ban took effect in May. That
removed Florida as a destination for abortion for many women from nearby
states with deeper bans and also led to far more women from the state
traveling to obtain abortion. The nearest states with looser
restrictions are North Carolina and Virginia — hundreds of miles
away. </p>
<p>“The reality is because of Florida’s constitution a minority of
Florida voters have decided Amendment 4 will not be adopted,” said
Lauren Brenzel, campaign director for the Yes on 4 Campaign said while
wiping away tears. “The reality is a majority of Floridians just voted
to end Florida’s abortion ban.” </p>
<p>In South Dakota, another state with a ban on abortion throughout
pregnancy with some exceptions, the defeat of an abortion measure was
more decisive. It would have allowed some regulations related to the
health of the woman after 12 weeks. Because of that wrinkle, most
national abortion-rights groups did not support it. </p>
<p>Voters in Nebraska adopted a measure that allows more abortion
restrictions and enshrines the state’s current 12-week ban and rejected
a competing measure that would have ensured abortion rights. </p>
<p>Other states guaranteed abortion rights </p>
<p>Arizona’s amendment will mean replacing the current law that bans
abortion after the first 15 weeks of pregnancy. The new measure ensures
abortion access until viability. A ballot measure there gained momentum
after a state Supreme Court ruling in April found that the state could
enforce a strict abortion ban adopted in 1864. Some GOP lawmakers joined
with Democrats to repeal the law before it could be enforced. </p>
<p>In Maryland, the abortion rights amendment is a legal change that
won’t make an immediate difference to abortion access in a state that
already allows it. </p>
<p>It’s a similar situation in Missouri, where abortion is already legal
until viability. </p>
<p>The Colorado measure exceeded the 55% of support required to pass.
Besides enshrining access, it also undoes an earlier amendment that
barred using state and local government funding for abortion, opening
the possibility of state Medicaid and government employee insurance
plans covering care. </p>
<p>A New York equal rights law that abortion rights group say will
bolster abortion rights also passed. It doesn’t contain the word
“abortion” but rather bans discrimination on the basis of “pregnancy
outcomes, and reproductive healthcare and autonomy.” Sasha Ahuja,
campaign director of New Yorkers for Equal Rights, called the result “a
monumental victory for all New Yorkers” and a vote against opponents who
she says used misleading parental rights and anti-trans messages to
thwart the measure. </p>
<p>The results end a win streak for abortion-rights advocates </p>
<p>Until Tuesday, abortion rights advocates had prevailed on all seven
measures that have appeared on statewide ballots since the fall of
Roe. </p>
<p>The abortion rights campaigns have a big fundraising advantage this
year. Their opponents’ efforts are focused on portraying the amendments
as too extreme rather than abortion as immoral. </p>
<p>Currently, 13 states are enforcing bans at all stages of pregnancy,
with some exceptions. Four more bar abortion in most cases after about
six weeks of pregnancy — before women often realize they’re pregnant.
Despite the bans, the number of monthly abortions in the U.S. has risen
slightly, because of the growing use of abortion pills and organized
efforts to help women travel for abortion. Still, advocates say the bans
have reduced access, especially for lower-income and minority residents
of the states with bans. </p>
<p>The issue is resonating with voters. About one-fourth said abortion
policy was the single most important factor for their vote, according to
AP VoteCast, a sweeping survey of more than 110,000 voters nationwide.
Close to half said it was an important factor, but not the most
important. Just over 1 in 10 said it was a minor factor. </p>
<p>The outcomes of ballot initiatives that sought to overturn strict
abortion bans in Florida and Missouri were very important to a majority
of voters in the states. More than half of Florida voters identified the
result of the amendment as very important, while roughly 6 in 10 of
Missouri’s voters said the same, the survey found.</p>

<h2 id="trump-wins-us-presidential-election">Trump wins US presidential
election</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump defeated Vice President Kamala
Harris to earn a new four-year term as the country’s leader.</p>
<p>In a tightly contested race, Trump secured at least 277 of the 538
available electoral votes in Tuesday’s election, giving him the
necessary majority to become the first U.S. leader to win
non-consecutive terms since the 1890s.</p>
<p>Harris, the Democratic candidate who joined the race late after
President Joe Biden dropped out in July, was trying to become the first
woman elected to the U.S. presidency.</p>
<p>Trump claimed victory early Wednesday as he thanked his supporters at
a rally in Florida.</p>
<p>“This was a movement like nobody’s ever seen before, and, frankly,
this was, I believe, the greatest political movement of all time,” Trump
said.</p>
<p>He pledged to “fix our borders” and “fix everything in our
country.”</p>
<p>Trump also said he would work to deliver a “strong, safe and
prosperous America.”</p>
<p>A Harris campaign official told a crowd of her supporters in
Washington that she would not address the gathering overnight but would
speak later Wednesday.</p>
<p>In the U.S. system, where the presidential election is tallied in a
series of state-by-state contests, both Harris and Trump were quickly
declared winners in states where their parties enjoy clear majority
support, while the nation focused on roughly seven so-called
battleground states that were expected to tip the balance in the
direction of the winner.</p>
<p>Ultimately it was Trump’s victories in Pennsylvania, Georgia, North
Carolina and Wisconsin that gave him the advantage.</p>
<p>Republican success Tuesday extended to Congress, where the party won
back a majority in the Senate with at least 51 of 100 seats. Control of
the House of Representatives, which is currently held by Republicans,
was not yet decided early Wednesday.</p>
<p>Trump served from 2017-2021 but left office after losing to Biden in
an election that Trump continued to falsely assert that he won. That
denial helped fuel the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by a
mob of his supporters who disrupted the official tallying of the 2020
election results.</p>
<p>Trump and his allies also launched numerous legal challenges after
the 2020 vote, with state and federal judges eventually dismissing more
than 50 lawsuits.</p>
<p>Since leaving office, Trump was convicted of 34 charges linked to
hush money payments he made to an adult film actress in the lead-up to
the 2016 election. Sentencing in that case is scheduled for November 26.
Trump was also indicted in three other cases, including two accusing him
of trying to illegally overturn the 2020 election and another alleging
he took hundreds of highly secret national security documents to his
Florida home.</p>
<p>Trump is scheduled to be inaugurated for a new term on January
20.</p>
<p>A key foreign policy focus in a new Trump administration will be
relations between the United States and China, including subjects such
as trade, Taiwan and China’s actions in the South China Sea.</p>
<p>Trump instituted a series of tariffs against Chinese imports amid a
trade war with China during his previous administration.</p>
<p>Vincent Wang, dean of the college of arts and sciences at Adelphi
University, told VOA Mandarin that China would be less likely to take an
aggressive stance than it would have been if Harris won.</p>
<p>“If Trump is elected, I think China may not dare, because he doesn’t
go through drafts, he has already said harsh words. If he wakes up
today, he might say he’s going to raise tariffs by 200 percent. If he
wakes up tomorrow, he might want to bomb Beijing. So I think this
so-called this Trump-type deterrent, on the contrary, will make them a
little bit more restrained,” Wang said Tuesday.</p>

<h2 id="world-leaders-congratulate-trump-on-election-win">World leaders
congratulate Trump on election win</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — World leaders offered congratulations to Donald
Trump after news media projections showed he secured a decisive victory
in the 2024 U.S. presidential election.</p>
<p>Trump defeated his Democratic rival Kamala Harris, marking a
historical political comeback for the former Republican president
following four years out of office.</p>
<p>Early Wednesday, many world leaders took to the social media website
X to congratulate Trump, whose unpredictable “America First” foreign
policy approach complicated relations with many U.S. allies and foes
alike during his first term in office.</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was one of the first U.S.
allies to send a message of support, praising Trump’s “historic return,”
which he said offers a “powerful recommitment to the great alliance
between Israel and America.”</p>
<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has called for more U.S.
and Western support to fight off Russia’s invasion, spoke positively of
what he said was Trump’s commitment to ‘peace through strength’ in world
affairs.</p>
<p>“This is exactly the principle that can practically bring just peace
in Ukraine closer. I am hopeful that we will put it into action
together,” said Zelenskyy.</p>
<p>The head of NATO — the Western military alliance that Trump has long
criticized for not doing enough to take care of Europe’s defense — made
similar comments in his congratulatory message for Trump.</p>
<p>“His leadership will again be key to keeping our Alliance strong. I
look forward to working with him again to advance peace through strength
through #NATO,” said Mark Rutte, the NATO Secretary General.</p>
<p>French President Emmanuel Macron also quickly offered
congratulations, saying he is “ready to work together as we did for four
years…with your conviction and mine.”</p>
<p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said his government stands
“shoulder to shoulder” in defense of shared values of freedom, democracy
and enterprise.</p>
<p>“From growth and security to innovation and tech, I know that the
UK-US special relationship will continue to prosper on both sides of the
Atlantic for years to come,” Starmer said.</p>
<p>Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the EU Commission, said she
“warmly congratulate[s]” Trump and praised the “true partnership”
between the European Union and the United States.</p>
<p>During Trump’s first term, friction erupted between the EU and the
U.S., partly over Trump’s imposition of tariffs on European exports.</p>
<p>Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban, a conservative Trump ally,
called Trump’s victory the “biggest comeback in US political history”
and said it was a “much needed victory” for the world.  </p>
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has not commented on the U.S.
election results. But on X, former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev
relished the apparent defeat of Harris, saying “Kamala is finished…let
her keep cackling infectiously.”</p>
<p>Asian leaders also began sending congratulatory messages.</p>
<p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said, “Australians and
Americans are great friends and true allies.”</p>
<p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered the “heartiest
congratulations” to Trump, who he called his friend.</p>
<p>“As you build on your successes of the previous term, I look forward
to reviewing our collaboration to further strengthen” the U.S.-India
relationship, Modi said.</p>
<p>In a statement, Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. expressed
hope that the “unshakeable alliance” between Washington and Manila,
“will be a force of good that will blaze a path of prosperity and amity,
in the region, and in both sides of the Pacific.”</p>

As the election odds swung sharply towards Republican Donald Trump as
Tuesday evening slid into Wednesday morning, climate-conscious
investors, academics, strategists, and other internet personalities were
mostly mute. It was a night to stare blankly at the TV, watch the needle
slowly tilt to the right, and vaguely wonder about the future of the
climate.
</p>
<p>
That is, unless you were

Musk</a>, Trump’s latest, closest campaign confidant, in which case
fist-pumping posts abounded. Well before any polls had closed, Musk
posted on X about supposedly “record numbers” of men turning out to vote

evening to come.

Around 2:30 a.m. ET, Trump took the stage at the convention in West Palm
Beach where his supporters had gathered and declared victory in the
race. By then
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-vs-harris-us-voters-head-polls-turbulent-campaign-concludes-2024-11-05/" target="_blank">some</a>,
though certainly not all networks had called the election in Trump’s
favor. He devoted a verse of his rambling, genial speech to Musk. “A
star is born: Elon,” Trump said in his victory speech, praising Musk’s
efforts on the campaign trail, his “beautiful” rockets, and Starlink,
which Trump apparently hadn’t heard of before Hurricane Helene.
</p>
<p>
Musk, for his part, seems psyched about the prospect of playing a role
in the Trump administration. “The future is gonna be fantastic,” he
<a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1854048115206078507" target="_blank">said</a>,
as the electoral votes crept closer to 270. Though climate tech investor
Kristin Ellis of Lowercarbon Capital did have one extra bit of
perspective to add:

Won. Now the Fight Over the Clean Energy Economy Begins.</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-06, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NDIzMTI3Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczNTU3MzU5N30.uxB61jSj4XA2vt-uxJjj0jw4N3eN82idAq54pcvvgPk/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
As of early Wednesday morning, Donald Trump seems likely to be
re-elected president of the United States, becoming the first commander
in chief since Grover Cleveland to serve non-consecutive terms.
</p>
<p>
Trump’s probable victory has profound implications for America’s
economy, security, and leadership in the world. But it will also impact
the country’s energy and environmental policy.
</p>
<p>
During his first term, Trump made his antipathy for climate policy into
a centerpiece of his politics, turning the United States into a global
pariah on environmental issues. His second term will play out in a
different context — one in which the United States has a real climate
law on its books, but also where China has seized a commanding lead in
many of the most important zero-carbon technologies. That means Trump’s
climate decisions will matter to the country’s economic policy in a way
that they never did before.
</p>
<p>
But what will a Trump administration look like? To begin with: Trump’s
victory will put climate advocates — and the broader clean energy
economy — on defense for the next four years and beyond.
</p>
<p>
The first few steps taken by the Trump administration are easy to
predict. He will pull the United States out of the Paris Agreement, just
like he did during the first term; he will approve a new tranche of
liquified natural gas export terminals; and he will block and then begin
to roll back the Environmental Protection Agency’s climate rules for
power plants, cars, and light-duty trucks.
</p>
<p>
Not all of these rollbacks will make themselves felt at first. The
current set of EPA clean car rules, for instance, apply to vehicles sold
through model year 2026. That is close enough to the present that
automakers have already begun to make the necessary investments to meet
those standards. But vehicles sold in the latter half of this decade
will likely face much weaker rules or none at all.
</p>
<p>
Then the bigger climate policy questions will come. First up is whether
Trump tries to repeal or otherwise hinder the Inflation Reduction Act,
the landmark climate incentives law passed by President Joe Biden. Trump
has said that he wants to
<a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/10/28/trump-climate-law-ira-pullback" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>“terminate”</u></a>
IRA spending, telling the Economic Club of New York that he seeks to
“rescind all unspent funds” under the law.
</p>
<p>
That would — as Trump hopes — set the country and world back in the
fight against climate change. But it would also significantly raise
taxes on energy companies (and automakers) while hurting Trump’s own
voters. The IRA’s hundreds of billions in investments, which are largely
tax credits, have overwhelmingly flowed to Republican districts.
According to
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/interactive/2024/climate-bill-biden-clean-energy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
</u><u><em><em>Washington Post</em></em></u><u> analysis</u></a>,
districts that backed Trump in 2020 have received three times as much
IRA funding as those that supported Biden. New factories making EVs,
batteries, and solar panels have popped up across purple and red
America, including in Georgia, Arizona, and the Sun Belt. That’s why 18
House Republicans have
<a href="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/4815990-mike-johnson-ira-clean-energy-tax-credits/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>asked</u></a>
Mike Johnson directly not to repeal the law. If Democrats ultimately win
the House of Representatives — we will probably not know for some weeks
— then Trump will lack the votes to repeal the law outright.
</p>
<p>
That’s the theory behind the IRA, at least. The climate law, like the
Affordable Care Act before it, is meant to protect itself from repeal by
tying itself to local economies across the country. Will that theory
hold? Will the climate law survive Trump’s first 100 days? Now we will
find out.
</p>
<p>
Even if the law itself stands, Trump may seek other ways to tamper with
it. By saying that he might “rescind the [IRA’s] unspent funds,” he is
raising the specter of impoundment, the name for when the president
delays or refuses to spend funding that Congress has authorized.
Impoundment is
<a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artII-S3-3-7/ALDE_00013376/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>of
dubious legality</u></a>, and it is regulated by
<a href="https://democrats-budget.house.gov/resources/reports/impoundment-control-act-1974-what-it-why-does-it-matter" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
1974 law</u></a> first passed to rein in Richard Nixon, but Trump might
nonetheless try to pause some IRA payments for a time. The first
impeachment case against him in 2019 concerned his impoundment of
defense funding for Ukraine.
</p>
<p>
Beyond the IRA, though, there are a number of lurking fissures in a
second Trump administration’s climate and environmental policy. Trump
has ascended to the White House with the assistance of a strange
coalition. It includes Elon Musk, an EV and defense contracting
billionaire, and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., an environmental lawyer turned
anti-vaccine crusader and
<a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/05/nx-s1-5063939/rfk-jr-central-park-bear-bicycle" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>roadkill
enthusiast</u></a>. Trump has promised to put Kennedy in charge of
public health policy, and Musk is supposedly going to oversee a new
Department of Government Efficiency.
</p>
<p>
These men agree on some policies. But they do not agree on everything,
including in the realm of energy policy. Even during his victory speech,
Trump jokingly warned Kennedy to “stay away from the liquid gold,”
referencing domestic oil production.
</p>
<p>
Kennedy is also a lifelong opponent of nuclear energy, and one of his
greatest career victories is shutting down New York’s nuclear reactor
Indian Point. Musk
<a href="https://www.ans.org/news/article-3812/elon-musk-shutting-down-nuclear-plants-is-total-madness/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>champions</u></a>
nuclear energy and has said shuttering reactors is “total madness.” The
likely next vice president, JD Vance,
also<a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jd-vance-joe-rogan_n_6723e7f7e4b0871068fea5de" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>
tacitly supports</u></a> nuclear. But Trump, who
<a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/29/us-news/trump-vows-to-make-electricity-cheap-with-hundreds-of-new-power-plants-and-modular-nuclear-reactors/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has
officially called</u></a> for the U.S. to build more nuclear reactors,
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/trump-cites-cost-and-risks-of-building-more-nuclear-plants/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has
sounded more skeptical</u></a> of nuclear energy lately.
</p>
<p>
Other fault lines risk dividing this cohort. Kennedy has
<a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/07/05/pollution-vaccine-theory-trans-people-mainstream" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>campaigned</u></a>
against the chemical industry. Will he back the buildout of refineries
and chemical plants that Trump has promised? Elon Musk has said that
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/elon-musk-climate-law-repeal-could-help-tesla/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>repealing
the IRA</u></a> could benefit Tesla by kneecapping its competitors. Yet
much of Tesla’s profit
<a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-ev-sales-credits-growing-c362771f" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>comes
from selling regulatory credits</u></a> created by California and the
federal government’s climate policies. If Trump repeals those policies,
what will happen to Tesla’s profitability? (Will Musk care?)
</p>
<p>
The backdrop to these disagreements will be the now forever altered
geopolitics for climate policy. Eight years ago, when Trump first took
office, climate policy was seen as fundamentally limited to the
environment — and clean energy was an important but up-and-coming,
almost wholesome niche pursuit that Democrats doted upon. Now the stuff
of clean energy — renewables, batteries, and EVs — are central to modern
economic development and to geopolitics.
</p>
<p>
China shows why that is. For every step back that Trump takes on climate
policy, China will step forward and take more of a global leadership
role. Indeed,
<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/chinas-perspective-on-the-us-withdrawal-from-the-paris-agreement/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>partly
because of Trump’s own policies</u></a>, China has taken a commanding
lead in zero-carbon technologies over the past decade. In particular it
now
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/ford-gm-stellantis-byd" target="_self"><u>dominates</u></a>
electric vehicle production, producing cheaper and technologically
superior models to anything available elsewhere in the world. If America
ends its support for EVs, then China will happily take what global
market share remains from U.S. automakers — in fact,
<a href="https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/market-insights/latest-news/metals/101424-chinas-ev-sales-output-hit-fresh-record-in-sep" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>it
is already doing so</u></a>. As Trump’s White House steers American
climate policy for the rest of the 2020s, they will not just be deciding
what direction the U.S. will go in — they will be acting with, or
against, the rest of the world.

Navy contractor behind one of the military’s biggest scandals sentenced
to 15 years</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SAN DIEGO — Former military defense contractor Leonard “Fat Leonard”
Francis was sentenced Tuesday to 15 years in prison for masterminding a
decade-long bribery scheme that swept up dozens of U.S. Navy officers,
federal prosecutors said.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Janis L. Sammartino also ordered Francis to pay
$20 million in restitution to the Navy and a $150,000 fine, according to
a statement from the U.S. Attorney’s Office. He was also ordered to
forfeit $35 million in “ill-gotten proceeds from his crimes,” the
statement said.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said the sentence resulted from Francis’ first guilty
plea in 2015 concerning bribery and fraud, his extensive cooperation
with the government since then and another guilty plea Tuesday for
failing to appear for his original sentencing hearing in 2022.</p>
<p>Shortly before he was due to be sentenced in September 2022, Francis
cut off a GPS monitor he was wearing while under house arrest and fled
the country. He was later arrested in Venezuela and brought back to the
U.S. in December 2023.</p>
<p>Sammartino sentenced him to more than 13 1/2 years for the bribery
and fraud charges, plus 16 months for failing to appear. The sentences
are to be served consecutively.</p>
<p>“Leonard Francis lined his pockets with taxpayer dollars while
undermining the integrity of U.S. Naval forces,” U.S. Attorney Tara
McGrath said in Tuesday’s statement. “The impact of his deceit and
manipulation will be long felt, but justice has been served today.”</p>
<p>Email and phone messages seeking comment were left Tuesday for
William Douglas Sprague, an attorney for Francis.</p>
<p>Sprague, who sought a sentence of just under nine years, argued that
his client’s cooperation should warrant a lesser sentence, 10 News San
Diego reported.</p>
<p>Sprague also said Francis’ company provided the Navy with exemplary
services for many years.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, as Leonard acknowledged in his early guilty plea and
immediate cooperation, his greed drove him to commit bribery and to
commit fraud,” Sprague said.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said Francis’ actions led to one of the biggest bribery
investigations in U.S. military history, which resulted in the
conviction and sentencing of nearly two dozen Navy officials, defense
contractors and others on various fraud and corruption charges.</p>
<p>An enigmatic figure who was 6-foot-3 and weighed 350 pounds at one
time, Francis owned and operated his family’s ship-servicing business,
Singapore-based Glenn Defense Marine Asia Ltd. or GDMA, which supplied
food, water and fuel to vessels. The Malaysian defense contractor was a
key contact for U.S. Navy ships at ports across Asia for more than two
decades. During that time, Francis wooed naval officers with Kobe beef,
expensive cigars, concert tickets and wild sex parties at luxury hotels
from Thailand to the Philippines.</p>
<p>In exchange, officers, including the first active-duty admiral to be
convicted of a federal crime, concealed the scheme in which Francis
would overcharge for supplying ships or charge for fake services at
ports he controlled in Southeast Asia. The officers passed him
classified information and even went so far as redirecting military
vessels to ports that were lucrative for his Singapore-based ship
servicing company.</p>
<p>In a federal sting, Francis was lured to San Diego on false pretenses
and arrested at a hotel in September 2013. He pleaded guilty in 2015,
admitting that he had offered more than $500,000 in cash bribes to Navy
officials, defense contractors and others. Prosecutors say he bilked the
Navy out of at least $35 million. As part of his plea deal, he
cooperated with the investigation leading to the Navy convictions. He
faced up to 25 years in prison.</p>
<p>While awaiting sentencing, Francis was hospitalized and treated for
renal cancer and other medical issues. After leaving the hospital, he
was allowed to stay out of jail at a rental home, on house arrest with a
GPS ankle monitor and security guards.</p>
<p>But three weeks before his scheduled sentencing in September 2022, he
snipped off his monitor and made a brazen escape, setting off an
international search. Officials said he fled to Mexico, made his way to
Cuba and eventually got to Venezuela.</p>
<p>He was arrested more than two weeks after his disappearance — caught
before he boarded a flight at the Simon Bolivar International Airport
outside Caracas. Venezuelan officials said he intended to reach
Russia.</p>
<p>The cases were handled by the U.S. Attorney’s Office in an effort to
be independent of the military justice system. But they have came under
scrutiny.</p>
<p>The felony convictions of four former Navy officers were vacated
following allegations of prosecutorial misconduct. Sammartino agreed to
allow them to plead guilty to a misdemeanor and pay a $100 fine
each.</p>
<p>Last year, Sammartino ruled that the lead federal prosecutor in the
officers’ case committed “flagrant misconduct” by withholding
information from defense lawyers, but that it was not enough to dismiss
the case.</p>

Today we’re talking about a breakout story of this election cycle: the
rise of prediction markets and betting on elections. For the first time
in a century, Americans can legally place bets on election outcomes
using a platform called Kalshi. But the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission warns that these markets could warp the public’s
understanding of our elections if they’re treated like polls. On this
Election Day episode, Cantrell Dumas of Better Markets, a financial
reform advocacy group, explains how Americans are dabbling in election
betting, the legal questions surrounding these prediction markets, and
why he believes manipulation of these markets has the potential to sway
elections.

<h2 id="voa-talks-with-us-presidential-3rd-party-candidates">VOA talks
with US presidential 3rd party candidates</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have
spent the past few months battling for the White House, and experts say
that votes for third party candidates could be a deciding factor for who
will become the next president of the United States.  </p>
<p>With the latest polls showing Harris and Trump in a dead heat in
battleground states around the country, ballots cast for third-party
candidates Jill Stein of the Green Party, independent Cornel West and
Libertarian Chase Oliver could be enough to tip the scales.  </p>
<p>VOA Persian spoke with all three of them. Their responses have been
edited for length and clarity.  </p>
<p>Green Party candidate Jill Stein </p>
<p>VOA: During one of his final campaign rallies in Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania, former President Donald Trump praised you, saying he loved
the Green Party and that you might be one of his favorite politicians.
What do you make of this?  </p>
<p>Jill Stein: I make of that about as much as I make of Donald Trump’s
assessment of climate change, which is that he sort of believes the
opposite of reality. I am in this race to provide an alternative to the
two parties that are bought and paid for, that are serving Wall Street
and the war contractors and definitely not the American people. So I
don’t have a lot of high regard for Donald Trump’s political strategies
or his values.  </p>
<p>VOA: How much support do you expect to receive in battleground states
like Michigan? There were some polls that suggested you have support of
over 40% of the Arab American population there.  </p>
<p>Stein: Exactly what the numbers will turn out to be, it depends how
many people are turning out to vote. It depends how strong the vote of
the, not only the Muslim population, but also many African Americans and
Hispanics and young people who feel like they do not have a future under
Kamala Harris, and they do not have a future under Donald Trump. At this
point, it’s too soon to say. We ourselves do not strictly work based on
polls. We’re really in this based on principle and for the long haul. We
would be delighted if we make the 5% cut in the national poll in the
national results, but it’s very hard to say at this point.  </p>
<p>VOA: What would be your position regarding the government of Iran?
 </p>
<p>Stein: I think we need to open the door to negotiations with Iran.
Iran has elected a new president who is said to be moderate and
interested in improving relations with the West, and we need to explore
that. I think the most critical thing in the Middle East right now is
resolving this expanding war and the intention of Bibi [Prime Minister
Benjamin] Netanyahu to create a wider war and drag the U.S. into it. I
think that is the greatest threat to peace in the Middle East right now
and has the potential to grow into a conflict that’s even bigger than
the Middle East. </p>
<p>Independent candidate Cornel West </p>
<p>VOA: How many states allowed you to have your name on the ballot and
why did others not?    </p>
<p>Cornel West: We’ve got 16 states where we have direct ballot access.
We have 24 states where we have write-in access, and that did require
petitions and signatures. So that required a lot of work on behalf of
magnificent volunteers. But it was very difficult. There’s been a
tremendous struggle, but we come up swinging.  </p>
<p>VOA: How different will your policy be compared to what we hear from
Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump?  </p>
<p>West: Martin Luther King [Jr.] said, militarism, racism, poverty and
materialism are the four forces that are sucking the democratic energy
out of the American social experiment. I take very seriously his
critique of militarism. I see that as a criticism of American foreign
policies in which we are so eager to create these lethal armed forces
rather than engage in wise diplomatic processes. And so there would be
no genocide. I would have had an embargo on any kind of military or
financial support of Israel as it was very clear that they were laying
bare this kind of massive massacre on innocent people, especially
innocent children and women and men.  </p>
<p>The same would be true in terms of being able to bring an end to the
war in Ukraine. Same would be true in terms of trying to be more
diplomatic with China. I see Kamala Harris as a militarist, Black woman.
That is to say she’s willing to not just provoke, but to push [Russian
President Vladimir] Putin. And I think Putin himself is still very much
a gangster and a war criminal in his own way, but he has a right —
Russia has a right to security. And the same is true with China. There’s
too much provocation, and I think that moves us toward World War III in
the same way that Trump moves us towards Civil War II at home. And that
was one reason why I wanted to provide some kind of alternative to Trump
and [U.S. President Joe] Biden.</p>
<p>And then when Biden had his LBJ moment [referring to Biden’s poor
debate performance] something that we talked about many, many months
ago, we just predicted that Harris now is following through on the same
militarism in Gaza. And of course, genocide, the crime of genocide, is a
litmus test of morality of any nation, any country, and if you deny it,
if you enable it, it’s a sign that you don’t have a moral fiber in your
military policy.  </p>
<p>VOA: Many people in the occupied West Bank are disturbed by Tehran’s
support for militants in Gaza. How do you see this considering the moral
aspects of your vision, your doctrine and your policy?    </p>
<p>West: Malcolm X used to say, I’m for truth, no matter who’s for it,
and justice, no matter who supports it. People can actually support just
movements for motivations that themselves are highly suspicious. When
the French supported the American revolutionaries, when Lafayette came
to the United States, it was partly because the French were over against
the British in Europe, they didn’t have a whole lot of solidarity with
these colonists responding against the British Empire. … The Soviet
Union supported the freedom struggles in Africa. It wasn’t always
because they just love Africans so much. It was anti-United States. They
had a Cold War going on, and their policies were strategic and tactical
in that way. The same would be true for Iran vis-a-vis Palestinians.</p>
<p>So I think we have to be very truthful about the ways in which the
motives might not always be attractive, but when you’re a people like
Palestinians this moment, whose backs are against the wall, they need
help from anybody, and it’s very important that people highlight their
plight so that their babies are not crushed. But that doesn’t mean that
those who are supporting them always have the right motives, and
therefore we can still be critical of what those motives are.  </p>
<p>Libertarian Party candidate Chase Oliver </p>
<p>VOA: In your platform, you mentioned that Libertarians seek the
United States at peace with the world. How different will your foreign
policy be?</p>
<p>Chase Oliver: It would be a drastic difference than what the status
quo has been, certainly since I’ve been an adult. Since I’ve been an
adult, let’s just call it the post-9/11 War on Terror kind of foreign
policy mindset that we’ve had, which I think is rooted in ideas that are
very black and white. You’re either with us or you’re with the
terrorists.</p>
<p>The best way to solve a problem is through a preemptive war or
through increasing our military presence in the region, to flex our
muscle. And what I think that has done is actually created further
instability, particularly in the Middle East, which I don’t think has
been a success despite the trillions of dollars we’ve spent in both Iraq
and Afghanistan. I don’t think you can say either of those nations are
particularly bastions of democracy, or that the region itself is now
more stable than it was.</p>
<p>And so for me, I would say let’s remove our military footprint and
start flexing our diplomatic muscle. Let’s start meeting with world
leaders directly, one on one. Let’s start forming coalitions around
peaceful ideas and free trade and voluntary exchange to tear down
barriers between our nations so that we can have cultural exchanges with
one another. I think these are the ideas that we really need to be
pushing, and not a militarized foreign policy that’s ruined the idea
that the United States must be the world’s enforcer.   </p>
<p>VOA: So you don’t see America as the leader of the free world with
its responsibilities?    </p>
<p>Oliver: I absolutely see America as a leader in terms of the markets
of the world, the economic engine of the world, the diplomatic arm of
the world. But it doesn’t need to be coming, using the military might of
the world. Teddy Roosevelt said, “Speak softly and carry a big stick.”
We have a very powerful military that can defend ourselves, and
ultimately, if there were a need and if Congress declared a war, fight a
war anywhere in the world with absolute certainty that we could dominate
our opponent. But you don’t flex your muscle like that around the world.
That’s not a position of strength. When you use that military might to
push your agenda, that’s actually a position of weakness, because good
ideas should not require force, and you should be able to diplomatically
work throughout the world.</p>
<p>And I recognize the world is not perfect. The world does not lack
violence. The world is not lacking for bad people, particularly
governments around the world who represent good people. And Iran is no
different. The government of Iran is abhorrent. They’re abusive to their
people. They curtail their rights. But the people of Iran are good,
innocent people who don’t deserve to have things like airstrikes and
missiles raining down upon them because of the evils of their
government. And I hope that ultimately, we can liberalize the world more
towards more liberalized things like free speech, freedom of movement
and freedom of religion. But that’s not going to come just from us
beating people down. </p>
<p>VOA: How difficult is it to run as a third-party candidate?    </p>
<p>Oliver: Running as an alternative party candidate has a lot of
challenges because the two mainstream parties have a lot of built-in
incumbency power, both in the number of elected officials they have as
well as things like taxpayer-funded primaries. So they basically take
taxes out of my wallet to fund primaries that help promote the
candidates that are Republicans and Democrats.</p>
<p>And as a Libertarian, we’re kind of left in the lurch there. So
there’s a lot of challenges, especially around things like ballot
access. There’s a lot of solutions. And actually a big part of my
platform is a thing called the voter bill of rights that will open up
this process, not just for Libertarians like myself, but all sorts of
other alternative parties that really need to have their voices
heard.</p>

Back-to-back Hurricanes Helene and Milton caused billions in damage. How
are insurers going to pay for it all? Turns out, insurance companies
have their own insurance. But as disasters get more severe and more
frequent, “reinsurance” isn’t covering what it used to. Also in this

become a lithium extraction hotspot, and small businesses seem hesitant

Army soldier injured while working on Gaza pier has died</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — A U.S. Army soldier who was injured in May while working
on the American-built pier to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza has
died. </p>
<p>Sargeant Quandarius Stanley, 23, was a motor transport operator and
was critically injured when high winds and heavy seas damaged the pier,
causing four Army vessels to become beached. Two other service members
also were injured but later returned to duty. </p>
<p>U.S. military officials have not provided details on how exactly
Stanley was injured but have noted it was not in combat. He died last

<h2 id="migrant-caravan-of-3000-heads-north-in-mexico">Migrant caravan
of 3,000 heads north in Mexico</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A caravan of approximately 3,000 migrants set off on Tuesday from
southern Mexico, headed toward the United States on the day when U.S.
voters were deciding between U.S. presidential candidates Kamala Harris
and Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Immigration has been a key issue in the U.S. election campaign.</p>
<p>Before heading northward, the migrants gathered in Tapachula, the
capital of the southern Chiapas state, carrying banners with messages
such as “NO MORE MIGRANT BLOOD” and images of the Virgin of Guadalupe,
an important religious and cultural symbol in Mexico, according to
Reuters witnesses.</p>
<p>“We want U.S. authorities to see us, to see that we are people who
want to work, not to harm anyone,” said Honduran migrant Roy Murillo,
who joined the caravan with his two children and his pregnant wife.</p>
<p>In recent years, several caravans with people hoping to enter the
United States have attempted to reach the U.S.-Mexican border, traveling
in mass groups for safety. Most have dispersed along the way.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid to travel alone with my family. Here, the cartels either
kidnap you or kill you. … That’s why we’re coming in the caravan,”
Murillo said.</p>
<p>Murillo recounted his unsuccessful attempts to secure an asylum
appointment through a mobile app developed by the U.S. Customs and
Border Protection agency.</p>
<p>Tapachula, a mandatory crossing point for tens of thousands of
migrants, has become one of Mexico’s most violent cities in recent
months, with migrants frequently targeted by organized crime, according
to official data.</p>
<p>“I feel suffocated here. That’s why we decided to leave,” said
28-year-old Venezuelan migrant Thais, who spoke on condition that her
surname not be used due to safety concerns.</p>
<p>She joined the caravan with her husband and 3-year-old daughter.</p>
<p>“I wish Mr. Trump and Ms. Kamala would see that we are human beings,
that we want to live and support our families,” she added.</p>
<p>Voters cast ballots on Tuesday in the race between Vice President
Harris, a Democrat seeking to become the first female U.S. president,
and Trump, a Republican immigration hard-liner aiming to regain the
presidency.</p>

Department of Agriculture bans school lunch fees for low-income
families</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that students eligible
for free or reduced price school meals cannot be charged processing fees
beginning in 2027.</p>
<p>School districts currently work with processing companies to offer
cashless payment systems for families. But the companies can charge
“processing fees” for each transaction. By law, students who are
eligible for reduced price meals cannot be charged more than 30 cents
for breakfast and 40 cents for lunch. With processing fees, however,
families can end up paying 10 times that amount. Processing companies
charge as much as $3.25 or 4% to 5% per transaction, according to a
recent report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.</p>
<p>For families with lower incomes who can’t afford to load large sums
in one go, processing fees can arrive weekly or even more frequently,
increasing costs disproportionately. Families that qualify for free or
reduced lunch pay as much as 60 cents per dollar in fees when paying for
school lunches electronically, according to the report.</p>
<p>The Agriculture Department’s new policy becomes effective starting in
the 2027-2028 school year. With this rule, the USDA will lower costs for
families with income under 185% of federal poverty guidelines, which
equals $57,720 for a family of four.</p>
<p>“USDA and schools across America share the common goal of nourishing
schoolchildren and giving them the fuel they need to learn, grow and
thrive,” said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack in a statement Friday.
“While today’s action to eliminate extra fees for lower-income
households is a major step in the right direction, the most equitable
path forward is to offer every child access to healthy school meals at
no cost. We will continue to work with Congress to move toward that goal
so all kids have the nutrition they need to reach their full
potential.”</p>
<p>The decision by the USDA follows a CFPB report that found online
school meal payments predominantly affect low-income families. School
lunch fees collectively cost families upwards of $100 million each year,
according to the report.</p>
<p>The USDA has mandated since 2017 that school districts inform
families of their options, but even when parents are aware, having to
pay by cash or check to avoid fees can be burdensome.</p>
<p>“It’s just massively inconvenient,” said Joanna Roa, 43, who works at
Clemson University in South Carolina as a library specialist and has two
school-aged children.</p>
<p>Roa said that when her son was in first grade and she saw the
$3.25-per-transaction fee for lunch accounts, she and her husband
decided to send him to school with packed lunches instead.</p>
<p>“A dollar here and there, I expected,” she said. “But $3.25 per
transaction, especially here in rural South Carolina where the cost of
living is a lot lower — as are the salaries — is a lot.”</p>
<p>Roa said packing lunch for two kids every day became a burden in both
time and effort for two working parents. For the past two years, thanks
to surplus funds, her school district has been providing free school
lunches, which has changed the equation, but Roa said that could end at
any point.</p>
<p>In its review of the 300 largest public school districts in the U.S.,
the CFPB found that 87% of sampled districts contract with payment
processors. Within those districts, the companies charge an average of
$2.37, or 4.4% of the total transaction, each time money is added to a
child’s account.</p>
<p>While payment companies maintain that school districts can negotiate
fees and rates before they agree to contracts, the CFPB found that
complex company structures “may insulate companies from competition and
make school districts less likely to negotiate.” Just three companies —
MySchoolBucks, SchoolCafe and LINQ Connect — dominate the market,
according to the report.</p>
<p>Without the ability to choose which company to work with, “families
have fewer ways to avoid harmful practices,” the agency said, “including
those that may violate federal consumer protection law.”</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
By the time the sun rose on Wednesday morning, Donald Trump had secured
more than the 270 electoral votes needed to clinch the White House,
making him the next president of the United States — again. The decision
will have
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/donald-trump-2024-climate-energy">monumental
consequences</a> for the renewables transition, energy prices, and
environmental issues. But it was not the only race of the night.
</p>
<p>
Heatmap has been keeping tabs on 36 of the most important climate
elections, from seats in the House and Senate down to local ballot
measures and attorneys general. Though this is far from an exhaustive
list of races that will touch the climate this year, we hope it’ll help
you piece together how and where climate-related issues are resonating
with voters around the country.
</p>
<p>
A few notes on how this list is organized:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
We’ve listed races by state according to when polls close, and within
each state, from the highest-level offices to the lowest, including
local referenda.
</li>
<li>
All incumbents are identified with an *.
</li>
<li>
Race status comes from state Boards of Elections and national trackers
like <em><em>The Associated Press</em></em> and <em><em>The New York
Times </em></em>to verify the winner in each race.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Many key races remained undecided as of Wednesday morning. While
Republicans took control of the Senate, the House is still up for grabs.

North Carolina Attorney General Stein has won the election for governor.
The state suffered one of the costliest storms in U.S. history earlier
this year due to the flooding from Hurricane Helene, which drew
attention to the divide between the two candidates who’d been running
for the state’s highest office. Republican Mark Robinson called climate
change “junk science” and said he’d

state Senator Marcus, who took on Causey on the grounds that he’d

<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/09/us/insurance-commissioner-hurricane-north-carolina.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">outraised
Causey nearly twice over</a>. While insurance commissioner isn’t the
sexiest race, the election drew outsized attention in part because of
Nationwide’s decision not to renew thousands of homeowner policies in
eastern North Carolina in 2023 due to climate change, and the
devastating flooding earlier this year from Hurricane Helene.

from automotive marketing research firm AutoPacific suggests political
affiliation is becoming a smaller factor in Americans’ decision making
process around whether to buy an electric vehicle. So far, most EV
adopters lean Democratic. But as EVs become more common, AutoPacific’s
survey suggests the political gap is shrinking. Among people who
identify as “future EV acceptors” – those who say they’ll consider
buying an EV in the future – 46% are Democrat, 28% are Republican, and
24% are independent or third party. That’s a narrower gap than exists
among current EV owners (54% of whom are Democrats and 30% are
Republicans). “When it comes to EV rejection, politics do play a small
role, albeit a declining one,”

sustainable one at that. Existing satellites are made mostly out of
aluminum. When they reach the end of their lives, they burn up in the
atmosphere, leaving behind particles that can damage the Earth’s
protective ozone layer. Wooden satellites, though, wouldn’t do this. And
wood could be surprisingly suitable for space flight: Without exposure
to oxygen, wood isn’t vulnerable to things like rot or fire. The
LingoSat will be monitored throughout its time in orbit for signs of
strain and to help researchers better understand how wooden satellites
might perform in space.

<p class="drop-caps">
When Joe Biden was still running for reelection to the presidency, he
often repeated the line that voters should keep him in the White House
to
“<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/01/20/us/biden-2024-president-election-news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>finish
the job</u></a>.” Though she would be loath to describe her mission that
way, that is more or less what Biden’s vice president, Kamala Harris,
has proposed since she took on the nomination — or perhaps more
precisely, that she will keep doing the job, though the job may never be
finished.
</p>
<p>
Donald Trump, on the other hand, wants to quit the job, burn down the
workplace, and steamroll the rubble. At least, that’s how it can appear
on some issues, climate change perhaps more than any other. There are
few policy areas where this election presents such a stark difference in
which path the candidates propose to take.
</p>
<p>
Let’s begin by considering Harris — a fairly ordinary Democrat when it
comes to climate, in that she has committed herself to strong climate
action but has not put it at the top of her policy agenda. Her truncated
presidential campaign reflected that emphasis, which might have given
climate activists some reason to be disappointed if what they were
looking for was someone who would place their issue at the center of her
campaign. Unlike abortion and economics, climate was absent from Harris’
TV ads and usually mentioned only in passing on the stump.
</p>
<p>
But by now, most advocates are savvy enough to understand that
campaigning and governing are not the same thing. The commitments a
president makes during the campaign matter, but structural factors
matter more as the policymaking process unfolds. Where is the center of
gravity in their party on the issue, and what demands will the party’s
coalition make? Who are the personnel staffing key agencies, and what
are their priorities? How do existing laws and programs position the
administration if there is no new legislation? What other forces are
trying to move climate policy in either direction?
</p>
<p>
Taking all those factors into consideration, the most likely outcome of
a Harris presidency is that her administration would maintain the
trajectory Joe Biden established (even if there is
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/climate-policy-harris-walz" target="_self"><u>plenty
of room</u></a> for her to expand on Biden’s climate accomplishments).
Subsidies from the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law will keep flowing. More
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/lpo/loan-programs-office" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>loans</u></a>
will bolster innovative green tech. Many of the Biden administration
appointees who currently work on energy and climate will probably stay
in their jobs, or at the very least be replaced by officials with a
similar outlook.
</p>
<p>
In other words, while Biden has been the most aggressive president in
history on climate change, Harris would come in a close second if she
does little more than continue Biden’s policies. And she hasn’t promised
much more than that — during the campaign, Harris proposed no new
large-scale climate initiatives.
</p>
<p>
If nothing else, that was realistic, since the prospects for a sweeping
new climate bill on the scale of the IRA getting through Congress would
be slight. That’s especially true if one or both houses are controlled
by Republicans, a distinct possibility no matter who becomes president.
</p>
<p>
If that president is Donald Trump, on the other hand,
<em><em>and</em></em> Republicans control Congress, the IRA and other
laws that fund climate programs would be under threat. Even if the GOP
does have full control, however, it
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/old-school-politics-ira" target="_self"><u>doesn’t
mean</u></a> the entire IRA is headed for repeal. Much of the money from
recent climate legislation has gone to districts represented by
Republicans, who will resist a wholesale dismantling of the law, and
even oil companies
<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9adc51ff-34f4-4aa2-b41b-5ebcbd7fd8cd?_hsmi=332210142" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>support</u></a>
some provisions from a simple desire to minimize regulatory uncertainty.
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, a Congress determined to roll back Biden-era climate
legislation will have plenty of targets to aim at, and it’s a near
certainty that at least some of the provisions in the bills Biden signed
would be undone. Trump would almost certainly withdraw again from the
Paris climate agreement (Biden recommitted to it after Trump rejected it
in his first term), move to increase fossil fuel production on federal
land, stymie enforcement of environmental laws, and be a loud and
consistent voice for rejecting climate science and increasing emissions.
</p>
<p>
On the campaign trail, Trump continues to promise that he will
“terminate the Green New Scam” and
<a href="https://x.com/Video_Grabz/status/1852641794665972064" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>claims</u></a>
that global warming is a myth “because we’re actually cooling.”
Increasing domestic fossil fuel production is so important to him that
he
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-hannity-dictator-authoritarian-presidential-election-f27e7e9d7c13fabbe3ae7dd7f1235c72" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>proclaimed
it</u></a> reason enough, along with border security, for him to become
“a dictator” for a day upon taking office. On that first day, he has
said, “I want to close the border, and I want to drill, drill, drill.”
</p>
<p>
But it’s more than the quantity of drilling, especially since America is
<a href="https://theconversation.com/under-both-trump-and-biden-harris-us-oil-and-gas-production-surged-to-record-highs-despite-very-different-energy-goals-236859" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>already
producing</u></a> more oil and gas than any country ever has. Earlier
this year, Trump
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/05/09/trump-oil-industry-campaign-money/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>told</u></a>
oil executives they should raise $1 billion for him, which, given the
tax and regulatory benefits he plans to bestow on them, would be a
bargain. While fossil fuel industry contributions haven’t reached that
billion-dollar line, the industry’s help for Trump has been
<a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/indus?ind=E01" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>substantial</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
In a Trump administration, most of the action would be in federal
agencies. As <em><em>Bloomberg</em></em>
<a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/climate-skeptics-are-hatching-big-plans-for-a-second-trump-term/ar-AA1tnYF7" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>recently
reported</u></a>, climate deniers with ties to Trump are “laying the
groundwork to bring back coal-fired power plants, gut science at the
Environmental Protection Agency and neuter the modeling used in the
federal government’s national climate assessment and other reports”
should he win. Though Trump has sought to distance himself from Project
2025, it provides the most detailed elaboration of current Republican
thinking on climate policy; among other things, it
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/04/climate/republicans-climate-project2025.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>suggests</u></a>
rolling back green subsidies, shuttering the Department of Energy office
distributing loans for clean technology, scaling back regulations meant
to limit emissions, and weakening enforcement of environmental laws.
</p>
<p>
The most critical goal of the project, which Trump
<a href="https://rollcall.com/2024/10/30/trump-schedule-f-plan-federal-worker-fears/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>embraces</u></a>
wholeheartedly, is to turn thousands of civil servants into political
appointees so they can be fired at will and replaced with more loyal
cronies. Those who work on climate-related issues, whether scientists or
administrators or
<a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/sep/26/jared-moskowitz/what-does-project-2025-say-about-the-national-weat/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>weather
forecasters</u></a>, would probably be high on the list.
</p>
<p>
And we can’t ignore a factor that will help shape climate policy no
matter who wins: the Supreme Court. When it has been discussed during
this campaign, the subject has usually been the 2022
<em><em>Dobbs</em></em> decision to overturn <em><em>Roe v.
Wade</em></em>. But the court’s recent decisions on the legal
architecture of government regulation could have an effect just as
momentous for climate policy as <em><em>Dobbs</em></em> has had on
abortion.
</p>
<p>
In the
<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/22-451_7m58.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>Loper
Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo</em></em></u></a> decision, the court
ended “Chevron deference,” essentially seizing for itself the
responsibility to guide implementation of laws that had previously
rested with federal agencies. The effect on future climate policy will
<a href="https://www.cfr.org/expert-brief/us-supreme-courts-chevron-deference-ruling-will-disrupt-climate-policy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>likely
be enormous</u></a>. We are at the front end of a wave of lawsuits by
fossil fuel companies and polluters of all kinds looking to the court’s
conservative majority to neuter environmental regulations. There’s no
telling just how far the conservative majority will go, but there isn’t
much reason for optimism in the short run. And the court’s direction
could be determined by who gets to make the next couple of appointments;
everything from a new liberal majority to a 7-2 or 8-1 conservative
supermajority is possible in the coming years.
</p>
<p>
While neither Kamala Harris nor Donald Trump put climate change at the
center of their campaigns, the climate kept intruding, whether in the
form of
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/park-fire-arson#:~:text=The%20Park%20Fire%2C%20which%20has%20burned%20nearly%20400%2C000%20acres%20near%20Paradise%2C%20north%20of%20Sacramento%2C%20is%20now%20the%20fourth%20biggest%20wildfire%20in%20California%E2%80%99s%20recorded%20history." target="_self"><u>wildfires</u></a>

or
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/hurricane-death-study" target="_self"><u>hurricanes</u></a>.
Just as those disasters are likely to worsen, the policy fights over
climate in the next four years will intensify. When we look back, 2024
may or may not turn out to have been
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/election-2024" target="_blank">the
most important election of our lifetimes</a>. But either way it turns
out, the consequences will be profound.

workers accept contract, end more than 7-week strike</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SEATTLE — Unionized machinists at Boeing voted Monday to accept a
contract offer and end their strike after more than seven weeks,
clearing the way for the aerospace giant to resume production of its
bestselling airliner and generate much-needed cash.</p>
<p>Leaders of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace
Workers district in Seattle said 59% of members who cast ballots agreed
to approve the company’s fourth formal offer and the third put to a
vote. The deal includes pay raises of 38% over four years, and
ratification and productivity bonuses.</p>
<p>However, Boeing refused to meet strikers’ demand to restore a company
pension plan that was frozen nearly a decade ago.</p>
<p>The contract’s ratification on the eve of Election Day clears the way
for a major U.S. manufacturer and government contractor to restart
Pacific Northwest assembly lines that the factory workers’ walkout have
idled for 53 days.</p>
<p>Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg said in a message to employees Monday night
that he was pleased to have reached an agreement.</p>
<p>“While the past few months have been difficult for all of us, we are
all part of the same team,” Ortberg said. “We will only move forward by
listening and working together. There is much work ahead to return to
the excellence that made Boeing an iconic company.”</p>
<p>According to the union, the 33,000 workers it represents can return
to work as soon as Wednesday or as late as Nov. 12. Boeing’s CEO has
said it might take “a couple of weeks” to resume production in part
because some could need retraining.</p>
<p>The contract decision is “most certainly not a victory,” said Eep
Bolaño, a Boeing calibration specialist based in Seattle who voted in
favor of ratification. Bolaño said she and her fellow workers made a
wise but infuriating choice to accept the offer.</p>
<p>“We were threatened by a company that was crippled, dying, bleeding
on the ground, and us as one of the biggest unions in the country
couldn’t even extract two-thirds of our demands from them. This is
humiliating,” Bolaño said.</p>
<p>Leaders of IAM District 751 had endorsed the latest proposal, saying
they thought they had gotten all they could though negotiations and the
strike.</p>
<p>“It is time for our members to lock in these gains and confidently
declare victory,” the union district said before Monday’s vote. “We
believe asking members to stay on strike longer wouldn’t be right as we
have achieved so much success.”</p>
<p>The average annual pay of Boeing machinists is currently $75,608 and
eventually will rise to $119,309 under the new contract, according to
the company.</p>
<p>A continuing strike would have plunged Boeing into further financial
peril and uncertainty.</p>
<p>CEO Kelly Ortberg, an outsider who started at Boeing only in August,
has announced plans to lay off about 10% of the workforce, about 17,000
people, due to the strike and a series of other factors that diminished
the company’s reputation and fortunes this year.</p>

<h2 id="us-voters-choose-between-kamala-harris-and-donald-trump">US
voters choose between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Poll results began pouring in late Tuesday in the tight presidential
contest between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald
Trump, with both notching early wins in their respective strongholds in
a historic poll that could see the U.S. elect its first female
president.</p>
<p>Trump, who is seeking to return to the White House after his 2020
loss, grabbed his home state of Florida, swinging the early tally into
his column with that state’s 30 electoral college votes. Harris, as
expected, locked down several smaller states on the East Coast. The
winning candidate needs 270 electoral college votes, out of 538, to win,
and some states were not expected to finish counting before Wednesday.
The winner will begin a four-year presidential term in January.</p>
<p>Political analysts predicted that the race would come down to just
seven political battleground states, where surveys show the two
candidates are within 2 percentage points of each other — making them
too close to call.</p>
<p>Watch related report by Kane Farabaugh:</p>
<p>Jim Kessler, vice president of policy at think tank Third Way, told
VOA late Tuesday that Harris offers something new to a particular
demographic of voters.</p>
<p>“I think part of it is that she’s a woman, and a woman of color,” he
said of Harris, who is of mixed Black and South Asian heritage. “And I
think many women are excited about that.”</p>
<p>Another point in her favor, he said, is the Supreme Court’s 2022
decision to overturn federally protected abortion access. Harris has
campaigned on a platform of codifying those protections into law.</p>
<p>“Literally, since that decision, Democrats have overperformed the
public opinion polls, in part because women are showing up at the polls
in higher numbers than men, especially compared to previous elections,”
he said.</p>
<p>Trump, who voted in Florida Tuesday, said he was confident in his
performance.</p>
<p>He told reporters, “If it’s a fair election, I’d be the first one to
acknowledge” the results, though it was not clear what might meet that
definition. Democratic critics say they expect Trump to challenge the
outcome unless he wins.</p>
<p>Both Harris and Trump have assembled a vast roster of experienced
election lawyers to contest any irregularities they believe might affect
the outcome to their candidate’s disadvantage.</p>
<p>More than 83 million Americans cast early votes before Tuesday,
either in person at polling stations or by mail.</p>
<p>The total is more than half the 158 million who voted in the 2020
election, when President Joe Biden defeated Trump. It was a Democratic
victory that to this day Trump says he was cheated out of by fraudulent
voting rules and vote counts.</p>
<p>Biden remained at the White House throughout the day and made no
public appearances.</p>
<p>A Trump victory would make him only the second president to serve two
non-consecutive terms, after Grover Cleveland in the 1880s. He would
also be the first felon to serve as president as he awaits sentencing
later in November after being convicted of 34 charges linked to his hush
money payment to a porn film star ahead of his successful 2016 run for
the presidency.</p>
<p>Harris for weeks has claimed she is the underdog in the campaign but
lately expressed more optimism and now says she expects to become the
country’s 47th president.</p>
<p>U.S. presidential elections are not decided by the national popular
vote but through the Electoral College, which turns the election into 50
state-by-state contests, with 48 states awarding all their electoral
votes to the winner in those states. Nebraska and Maine allocate theirs
by both statewide and congressional district vote counts.</p>
<p>The number of electoral votes in each state is based on population,
so the biggest states hold the most sway in determining the overall
national outcome. Aside from the 19 electoral votes at stake in
Pennsylvania, two other battleground states, Georgia and North Carolina,
have 16 apiece, and Michigan has 15.</p>
<p>Voters near the nation’s capital told VOA that their exercise in
democracy was a pleasant one.</p>
<p>Voting was “just a smooth process,” said Arlington, Virginia, voter
Neil Puri. “Civility. Having people respect each other again and vote
with love rather than party lines.”</p>
<p>And in Alabama — a state Trump claimed early in the evening — Pastor
Robby Boyd told VOA’s Lao Service that he had faith in a smooth
outcome.</p>
<p>“My biggest concern is that there are questions that linger no matter
who wins, that there are questions or charges of fraud,” he said. “We
don’t want that to happen. I just pray that it’s so obvious whoever the
winner is, that we can move on as a country.”</p>

county in swing state of Georgia counting ballots ahead of Election
Day</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Lawrenceville, Georgia — One of the most ethnically diverse counties
in the Southeastern United States will be among those issuing early
voting results Tuesday night, a reveal that could indicate which of the
presidential candidates is in the lead in the crucial count of 538
electoral votes.</p>
<p>The victor must receive at least 270 of those electoral votes, and
Georgia, seen as one of the seven states where the outcome is uncertain,
has 16 of those precious votes. Only Pennsylvania has more — 19 — among
the battleground states. North Carolina also has 16.</p>
<p>The other wild cards are Arizona (11), Michigan (15), Nevada (6) and
Wisconsin (10).</p>
<p>It is possible for the declared victor in the electoral count to lose
the national popular vote total. That last happened in 2016, when
Republican Donald Trump won 304 electoral votes but lost the popular
vote to Democrat Hillary Clinton by about 2%.</p>
<p>It could be days before the United States knows who its next
president will be, but at the Gwinnett County Voter Registration and
Elections headquarters in the swing state of Georgia, workers are
already scanning several hundred thousand ballots submitted in advance
by mail-in and early voters. The tabulations of those ballots will be
released the moment the polls close at 7 p.m. on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Up to 70% of the vote total from those already-processed ballots will
be known within that first hour, said Zach Manifold, the county’s
elections supervisor.</p>
<p>“And then, kind of a long night begins,” Manifold told VOA on Monday.
“Our first precinct usually arrives maybe about 8:30, just depending on
how much line there is at seven o’clock. But 8:30 is the first precinct.
We have 156 precincts that all have to come back. I don’t know why, but
it always seems like that last one comes in sometime between 11:30 and
midnight.</p>
<p>“After you get past midnight, you’ll probably have just about all the
precincts in and have a pretty good feel for the final — at least the
unofficial results — for Gwinnett,” Manifold said.</p>
<p>To demonstrate transparency, the media, which is expected to include
dozens of TV news crews and other journalists from around the world,
will be allowed in the large room where the ballots are opened. The
reporters will be kept behind a cordon but not prevented from observing
the entire process. Activities in the tabulation room, in another part
of the same building, will be livestreamed online.</p>
<p>Gwinnett County, with a population of about 1 million, is the
second-largest county in Georgia. It is remarkable for its exceptional
diversity, with no single ethnic group making up more than about
one-third of its residents. In 2023, non-Hispanic whites made up about
one-third of the country’s population, as did African Americans,
according to census data.</p>
<p>“We have a very large Hispanic population, Asian population, Black
population,” said Manifold. “It is a very much a mixture of what is
America. And, so, I think a lot of the reason that people are wanting to
see what Gwinnett’s like [on election night] is, I think, Gwinnett is a
lot like modern America.”</p>
<p>Democrat Joe Biden’s strong margin in this suburban county four years
ago helped him narrowly win Georgia and thus the presidency, unseating
Trump.</p>
<p>Gwinnett County voted Republican every year between 1980 and 2012,
but in line with a trend of suburban political realignment, went
narrowly for Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016. Trump, a political novice
that year, won Georgia overall in 2016, which was key to his unexpected
presidential victory.</p>
<p>Regardless of the outcome this week, Manifold knows he will be
drinking a lot of coffee from Tuesday morning to stay alert.</p>
<p>“It’s about a 24-hour day a lot of the time in these presidential
elections,” he said. “I’ll start at our warehouse at 4 a.m., and we’ll
see what time we get out of here at the main office.”</p>

<h2 id="somali-americans-gear-up-for-us-elections">Somali Americans gear
up for US elections</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MINNEAPOLIS, MN — Somali Americans in Minnesota last month took part
in a town hall involving Democratic and Republican party representatives
encouraging them to participate in the 2024 election, arguing the stakes
are high for them and their grandchildren.</p>
<p>During a VOA town hall event in Minneapolis, Somali Americans
listened to remarks by panelists from both political parties, who
answered questions about the economy, immigration, and foreign policy,
explaining what their candidate would do to win the votes of Somali
Americans.</p>
<p>Economic policy</p>
<p>While many Somali Americans are traditionally Democratic-leaning,
there are rising numbers who support former President Donald Trump,
crediting him for stronger economic conditions during his presidency,
despite concerns over his immigration policies.</p>
<p>Faisal Deri, chair of the African Republicans of Minnesota, urged
Somali Americans to vote for Trump, stating that Somali Americans,
including truck drivers, experienced positive economic conditions during
his presidency.</p>
<p>“Truck drivers’ business was thriving, with a high volume of work and
plenty of income flowing in. That brought significant money into the
community, and they were able to send substantial support to their
relatives in Somalia. But, under [President Joe] Biden’s term, business
was down, and many have been forced to park their trucks,” Deri
said.</p>
<p>Nimo Ahmed, a Democrat and an activist, is the chair of the Somali
American Coalition Action Fund. She said there’s no way the community
will vote for Trump, claiming his policies primarily benefit
millionaires.</p>
<p>“[Vice President Kamala] Harris will support small businesses, which
are essential for many Somali families in Minnesota who run small
stores. Trump had focused on supporting millionaires and would continue
to do so, but we are middle-class people, and only the Democratic Party
truly supports the middle class,” Ahmed said.</p>
<p>Habon Abdulle, director of Ayada Leads, an organization that empowers
African diaspora women, stressed that it is crucial for everyone to
vote.</p>
<p>“Vote for whoever you choose, but please vote, because your vote
reflects your values and who you’re negotiating with. Please make your
voice heard,” Abdulle said.</p>
<p>On the economy, the other questions posed to the panelists included:
Why is the U.S. spending billions of dollars on foreign wars while
homelessness persists in America? What actions can Harris take to
address high interest rates, given the community’s desire for affordable
homeownership?</p>
<p>In response, Deri asserted that the ongoing wars abroad have
contributed to rising interest rates. He noted that when Trump was in
office, interest rates were low, allowing many Somalis to purchase
homes. However, that is no longer the case, as affordability has
decreased.</p>
<p>“If Trump returns to the White House, his first action would be to
end the wars and cut foreign aid to Ukraine, rearranging those funds for
use within the United States,” Deri said.</p>
<p>Nimo Ahmed defended Harris on economic policies, asserting that her
policies aim to support lower and middle-class Americans.</p>
<p>Immigration policy</p>
<p>Trump’s plans for “mass deportations” as well as tightening
immigration policy are also concerns for Somali Americans, as well as a
travel ban that affected many foreign visitors during his last term in
office. Community members said they worry reinstating travel bans could
halt family reunifications, and mass deportations could impact many
Somali residents in the United States.</p>
<p>Ahmed, the Democrat party supporter, said Trump’s policies would not
be good for Somali American communities.</p>
<p>“Trump doesn’t respect immigrants and has referred to them as
‘poisoning the blood.’ We must support Harris to prevent deportations so
Somalis without legal status can live with dignity here. When Trump
talks about ‘poisoning the blood,’ he’s including some Somalis in that
group, so we need to protect them,” Ahmed said.</p>
<p>In contrast, Deri, the Republican panelist, argued that Trump’s
immigration policies focus on preventing criminals from entering the
United States, a benefit to all American communities, including
Somalis.</p>
<p>“The deportation policy targets criminals who bring drugs into the
country, which especially harms minorities like us. The focus isn’t on
Somalis, and each country’s rules must be respected,” Deri said.</p>
<p>Foreign policy</p>
<p>Ahead of the election, opinion surveys have indicated that many
American Muslims oppose the Biden administration’s handling of the war
between Israel and Hamas. During the VOA town hall, some participants
questioned why they should support Harris when there seems to have been
no significant action in ending the conflict in Gaza.</p>
<p>“I don’t support Biden and Harris for failing to establish a
cease-fire in Gaza. It’s disheartening, but Trump doesn’t have anything
for Gazans; their lives would only be worse if he were to be elected. I
prefer Harris’s party because they can be held accountable, while
Trump’s administration lacks that accountability,” Democrat Nimo Ahmed
said.</p>
<p>The war in Gaza began on October 7, 2023, following a terror attack
in southern Israel by Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group.</p>
<p>Deri, the pro-Republican activist argued that the Biden-Harris
administration’s policies have been tested, and they missed their
opportunity to deliver aid to Gaza.</p>
<p>“If we vote for Harris, we are rewarding someone who has failed.
Trump is a strong leader, and he could potentially resolve the Gaza
situation quickly,” Deri said.</p>
<p>Amin Harun, a lawyer in Minneapolis, said the division of opinion
among American Muslims is a significant issue.</p>
<p>“Some are voting, some are rejecting, and others are supporting
different candidates. Unifying the voices of Muslims is essential for
expressing their collective thoughts,” Harun said.</p>
<p>Abdulle, the director of the Ayada Leads organization, underscored
the importance of voting.</p>
<p>“Even if you don’t vote for the president, you need to participate in
local elections, vote for local seats so that your votes make an
impact,” Abdulle said.</p>
<p>Ifrah Farah, a town hall attendee, said there should not be a reason
to equate the policies of Biden with those of Harris, who she said has
her own political agenda.</p>
<p>Farah urged participants to vote, stating, “Elections are crucial. If
you’re a citizen of this country, you should vote because it will
benefit you and your children in the future.”</p>
<p>As the community gears up for these crucial elections, there are
dozens of Somali American candidates vying for seats to represent a
rapidly growing immigrant community that has exceeded 300,000.</p>
<p>This story originated in VOA’s Somali Service. The townhall was
recorded on October 19, 2024, and was conducted in Somali. The
discussion has been translated into English for this story.</p>

id="us-issues-election-eve-warning-of-ramped-up-russian-influence-ops">US
issues Election Eve warning of ramped-up Russian influence ops</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Just hours before tens of millions of U.S. voters headed
to the polls for the country’s presidential election, U.S. intelligence
agencies issued a dire warning about ramped up influence operations –
some apparently aimed at convincing Americans to turn on each other.</p>
<p>The statement late Monday cautioned voters to beware of a new wave of
influence operations aimed at undermining trust and confidence in the
U.S. election process, adding that a flood of fake videos and articles
meant to spark outrage and inflame tensions is likely to only
accelerate, especially in swing states that could determine the outcome
of the presidential race.</p>
<p>“Russia is the most active threat,” according to the warning issued
by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the FBI and the
Cybersecurity and Information Security Agency, or CISA.</p>
<p>“Influence actors linked to Russia in particular are manufacturing
videos and creating fake articles to undermine the legitimacy of the
election, instill fear in voters regarding the election process, and
suggest Americans are using violence against each other due to political
preferences,” they said.  </p>
<p>“We anticipate Russian actors will release additional manufactured
content with these themes through election day and in the days and weeks
after polls close,” the statement added. “These efforts risk inciting
violence, including against election officials.”</p>
<p>The last-minute warning follows a series of declassified assessments
that U.S. intelligence officials have issued in the weeks and months
leading up to Tuesday’s election.</p>
<p>Yet while most votes have been cast without issue, organizations
representing state election officials cautioned there are likely to be
some disruptions.</p>
<p>“As with any Election Day, it is important to note operational issues
may arise,” according to the National Association of State Election
Directors and the National Association of Secretaries of State.</p>
<p>“Voting locations could open late, there could be lines during busy
periods, or an area could lose power,” they said in a statement. “These
are inevitable challenges that will arise on Election Day.”</p>
<p>There have also been other efforts to try to derail the election.</p>
<p>CISA said it has observed “small scale incidents,” including efforts
to take down official election websites with distributed denial of
service attacks, as well as several attempts to blow up or set fire to
ballot drop boxes.</p>
<p>The most recent declassified assessment, issued just two weeks ago,
warned Russia, Iran and China “remain intent on fanning divisive
narratives to divide Americans and undermine Americans’ confidence in
the U.S. democratic system consistent with what they perceive to be in
their interests.” </p>
<p>It further warned that intelligence obtained by U.S. intelligence
agencies made them “increasingly confident” that Russia was starting to
engage in plans “aimed at inciting violence,” and that Iran might follow
Moscow’s lead. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The information shared in the new warning builds on that assessment,
pointing to a flurry of new activity linked to Russia.</p>
<p>Specifically, the new statement blames Kremlin-linked actors for
posting and amplifying an article falsely claiming that U.S. officials
in key states are orchestrating a plan to rig the election by using
tactics such as ballot stuffing and cyberattacks.</p>
<p>It also links Russian actors to a video of a fake interview of an
individual claiming a scheme in the Southwestern state of Arizona sought
to tip the vote in favor of Democratic presidential candidate Vice
President Kamala Harris with fake overseas ballots and doctored voter
rolls.</p>
<p>U.S. intelligence agencies had already attributed responsibility for
other social media videos to Russian influence actors — including two
last week claiming to show Haitian immigrants voting multiple times and
purporting to show ballots in Pennsylvania being ripped up.  </p>
<p>The latest statement also warned that Iran “remains a significant
foreign influence threat to U.S. elections,” citing, in part, previously
Iranian efforts to hack the campaign of Republican presidential
candidate, former President Donald Trump. </p>
<p>VOA has reached out to the Russian Embassy in Washington and the
Iranian Mission to the United Nations in New York for a response to the
new U.S. allegations.</p>
<p>Russia, Iran and China have repeatedly rejected previous U.S.
assessments of their influence operations.</p>
<p>The Russian Embassy in Washington late Monday in an email to VOA
dismissed the newest U.S. intelligence warning as “baseless.”</p>
<p>“The Embassy has not received either any proof for these claims
during its communications with U.S. officials, or any inquiries
regarding the narrative being promoted by the press,” the embassy said,
further describing Washington’s accusations of Russian disinformation
campaigns “an unfortunate tradition” for U.S. elections.</p>
<p>The Iranian Mission to the United Nations in New York has yet to
respond to VOA’s request for comment.</p>
<p>Despite concerns about the potential of Russian and Iranian influence
operations, the U.S. expressed confidence earlier Monday that other
foreign efforts to hack into the country’s election infrastructure in
order to alter the vote tally would come up short. </p>
<p>In a briefing with reporters, CISA officials said there is no
evidence to suggest foreign adversaries like Russia, Iran and China have
the wherewithal to infiltrate and manipulate the country’s election
infrastructure.</p>
<p>“I can say with great confidence that I do not believe that a
technical hack of our elections in the way that it would materially
impact the presidential election is possible,” said CISA Director Jen
Easterly.</p>
<p>“Given the multiple layers of safeguards, the cybersecurity
protections, the physical access controls, the preelection testing of
equipment for accuracy, the postelection audits, it would not be
possible for a bad actor to tamper with or manipulate our voting systems
in such a way that it would have a material impact on the outcome of the
presidential election, certainly not without being detected,” Easterly
told reporters.</p>
<p>Some of the confidence stems from the decentralized way U.S.
elections are run — with each state using its own, individual system to
record and tally ballots. But it also follows years of preparation by
CISA, working with state and local election officials across the United
States.</p>
<p>Those efforts have included more than 700 cybersecurity assessments,
and hundreds of election exercises and training sessions since the start
of 2023.</p>
<p>Additionally, none of the state voting systems are connected to the
internet, and an estimated 97% of U.S. voters will be casting ballots in
jurisdictions that produce paper records as a backup.</p>
<p>“Our election infrastructure has never been more secure,” Easterly
said. “The election community has never been better prepared to deliver
safe, secure, free and fair elections.”</p>
<p>As of late Monday, CISA estimated that more than 77 million Americans
had already cast ballots during the early voting period, with tens of
millions more expected to vote in person on Election Day.</p>
<p>That confidence, however, has been tempered by concerns that foreign
actors could play on mundane disruptions, like power outages, or
cyberattacks on other U.S infrastructure to spark fears across the
U.S.</p>
<p>“As with any Election Day, it is important to note operational issues
may arise,” according to the National Association of State Election
Directors and the National Association of Secretaries of State.</p>
<p>“Voting locations could open late, there could be lines during busy
periods, or an area could lose power,” they said in a statement. “These
are inevitable challenges that will arise on Election Day.”</p>
<p>Already, there have also been other efforts to try to derail the
election.</p>
<p>CISA said it has observed “small scale incidents,” including efforts
to take down official election websites with distributed denial of
service attacks, as well as several attempts to blow up or set fire to
ballot drop boxes. </p>
<p>“We expect that these types of incidents and other forms of
disruptions will continue on Election Day [and] in the days that
follow,” Easterly told reporters, adding despite cause for concern there
have been “no significant impacts to election infrastructure.” </p>
<p>Still, CISA and its state and local partners are wary that even
though the U.S. is on track, foreign influence campaigns could alter the
perception among voters due to what U.S. officials have described as “a
firehose of disinformation.”</p>
<p>Some of the efforts, like those attributed to Russia and Iran, have
gained widespread attention.</p>
<p>Others, like Chinese efforts against Republican lawmakers and
candidates seen as critical to Beijing, appear to be more targeted.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And gauging the effectiveness of these efforts, especially the recent
videos attributed to Russia, is difficult to determine.</p>
<p>“The successfulness, I would say, is quite small,” said Brian Liston,
a senior threat intelligence analyst with Recorded Future’s Insikt
Group.</p>
<p>“We have not really seen these videos, or this content break out
beyond social media or on Telegram,” Liston told VOA.</p>
<p>But there are concerns, however, that some of these narratives could
gain traction on more mainstream social media platforms.</p>
<p>“Since Elon Musk took over Twitter and gutted content moderation and
really changed the purpose of X, we’ve seen it become just a hotbed of
mis and disinformation,” said Audrey McCabe, an information
accountability analyst at Common Cause, a nonpartisan watchdog and
advocacy organization.</p>
<p>McCabe told reporters Monday that the changes to X have rippled
across the social media space.</p>
<p>“[It] has allowed other platforms to lower their standards for
content moderation and what they’re doing to protect users,” she said.
“And so, we’re seeing an increase of this stuff everywhere, including on
Meta, and other platforms as well.”</p>
<p>And if some of the foreign influence efforts spread far enough, it
could help exacerbate exiting tensions.</p>
<p>“They are deliberately finding narratives to try to stoke partisan
discord and inflame domestic tension and pit Americans against one
another, and we cannot let them succeed,” a senior CISA official said,
who briefed reporters last Friday on the condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>“We’ve seen how these disinformation campaigns have led to very real
threats of violence targeting these public servants, and that should be
unacceptable,” the official added, citing repeated threats against
election officials across the country. </p>
<p>CISA officials on Monday said that state and local election officials
have been in close contact with law enforcement agencies, and that
precautions have been put in place to better protect election workers,
election officials and even the ballots themselves.</p>
<p>They also emphasized that so far, there have been no credible or
specific threats to polling locations.</p>
<p>“We’ve not seen specific reporting about violence at polling places,”
Easterly said Monday in response to a question from VOA. “I certainly
don’t want voters to feel at all intimidated about going to voting
locations.”</p>

There are only a few bills with strong bipartisan support in the
soon-to-be lame duck Congress. Requiring AM radio in new cars is one of
them. Proponents say AM radio is a vital part of the Emergency Alert
System and still broadcasts news in rural communities. Carmakers aren’t
buying it. Plus, the Dow’s got some newcomers, OPEC (once again)
postpones increasing oil production, and farmers stress about tariffs
ahead of the election.

id="remains-of-nearly-30-civil-war-veterans-found-in-funeral-homes-storage-are-laid-to-rest">Remains
of nearly 30 Civil War veterans found in funeral home’s storage are laid
to rest</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PAWTUCKET, R.I. — For several decades, the cremated remains of more
than two dozen American Civil War veterans languished in storage
facilities at a funeral home and cemetery in Seattle.</p>
<p>The simple copper and cardboard urns gathering dust on shelves only
had the name of each of the 28 soldiers — but nothing linking them to
the Civil War. Still, that was enough for an organization dedicated to
locating, identifying and interring the remains of unclaimed veterans to
conclude over several years that they were all Union soldiers deserving
of a burial service with military honors.</p>
<p>“It’s amazing that they were still there and we found them,” said Tom
Keating, the Washington state coordinator for the Missing in America
Project, which turned to a team of volunteers to confirm their war
service through genealogical research. “It’s something long overdue.
These people have been waiting a long time for a burial.”</p>
<p>Most of the veterans were buried in August at Washington’s Tahoma
National Cemetery.</p>
<p>In a traditional service offered to Civil War veterans, the
historical 4th U.S. Infantry Regiment dressed in Union uniforms fired
musket volleys and the crowd sang “The Battle Hymn of the Republic.”
Names were called out for each veteran and their unit before their
remains were brought forward and stories were shared about their
exploits. Then, they were buried. </p>
<p>Among them was a veteran held at a Confederate prison known as
Andersonville. Several were wounded in combat and others fought in
critical battles including Gettysburg, Stones River and the Atlanta
campaign. One man survived being shot thanks to his pocket watch – which
he kept until his death — and another deserted the Confederate Army and
joined the Union forces. </p>
<p>“It was something, just the finality of it all,” Keating said, adding
they were unable to find any living descendants of the veterans. </p>
<p>While some remains are hidden away in funeral homes, others were
found where they fell in battle or by Civil War re-enactors combing old
graveyards. </p>
<p>Communities often turn reburials into major events, allowing
residents to celebrate veterans and remember a long-forgotten war. In
2016, a volunteer motorcycle group escorted the remains of one veteran
cross country from Oregon to the final resting place in Maine. In South
Carolina, the remains of 21 Confederate soldiers recovered from
forgotten graves beneath the stands of a military college’s football
stadium were reburied in 2005. </p>
<p>Sometimes reburials spark controversy. The discovery of the remains
of two soldiers from the Manassas National Battlefield in Virginia
prompted an unsuccessful attempt in 2018 by several families to have DNA
tests done on them. The Army rejected that request and reburied them as
unknown soldiers at Arlington National Cemetery. </p>
<p>Along with those buried at Tahoma, Keating said, several others will
be buried at Washington State Veterans Cemetery and a Navy veteran will
be buried at sea. The remains of several more Civil War veterans were
sent to Maine, Rhode Island and other places where family connections
were found. </p>
<p>Among them was Byron Johnson. Born in Pawtucket in 1844, he enlisted
at 18 and served as a hospital steward with the Union Army. He moved out
West after the war and died in Seattle in 1913. After his remains were
delivered to Pawtucket City Hall, he was buried with military honors at
his family’s plot in Oak Grove Cemetery. </p>
<p>Pawtucket Mayor Donald R. Grebien said Johnson’s burial service was
the right thing to do. </p>
<p>“When you have somebody who served in a war but especially this war,
we want to honor them,” he said. “It became more intriguing when you
think this individual was left out there and not buried in his own
community.” </p>
<p>Grebien said the burials recall important lessons about the 1861-1865
war to preserve the Union, fought between the North’s Union Army and the
Confederate States of America at a cost of hundreds of thousands of
lives. </p>
<p>“It was important to remind people not only in Pawtucket but the
state of Rhode Island and nationwide that we have people who sacrificed
their lives for us and for a lot of the freedoms we have,” he said. </p>
<p>Bruce Frail and his son Ben — both long active in the Sons of Union
Veterans of the Civil War — were on hand for service. Ben Frail was also
a re-enactor at Johnson’s service, portraying a Union Army captain. </p>
<p>“It’s the best thing we can do for a veteran,” said Bruce Frail, a
former commander-in-chief with the Sons of Union Veterans and state
coordinator for Missing in America Project. </p>
<p>“The feeling that you get when you honor somebody in that way, it’s
indescribable,” he said. </p>
<p>The task of piecing together Johnson’s life story was left to Amelia
Boivin, the constituent liaison in the Pawtucket mayor’s office. A
history buff, she recalled getting the call requesting the city take
possession of his remains and bury them with his family. She got to work
and Johnson’s story became the talk of City Hall. </p>
<p>She determined Johnson grew up in Pawtucket, had two sisters and a
brother and worked as a druggist after the war. He left to make his
fortune out West, first in San Francisco and eventually in Seattle,
where he worked nearly up until his death. It doesn’t appear Johnson
ever married or had children, and no living relatives were found. </p>
<p>“I felt like it was resolution of sorts,” Boivin said. “It felt like
we were doing right for someone who otherwise would have been lost to
history.”</p>

id="pennsylvania-judge-musks-1-million-a-day-voter-sweepstakes-can-proceed">Pennsylvania
judge: Musk’s $1 million-a-day voter sweepstakes can proceed</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PHILADELPHIA — The $1 million-a-day voter sweepstakes that Elon Musk
’s political action committee is hosting in swing states can continue
through Tuesday’s presidential election, a Pennsylvania judge ruled
Monday.</p>
<p>Common Pleas Court Judge Angelo Foglietta — ruling after Musk’s
lawyers said the winners are paid spokespeople and not chosen by chance
— did not immediately explain his reasoning.</p>
<p>District Attorney Larry Krasner, a Democrat, had called the process a
scam “designed to actually influence a national election” and asked that
it be shut down.</p>
<p>Musk lawyer Chris Gober said the final two recipients before
Tuesday’s presidential election will be in Arizona on Monday and
Michigan on Tuesday.</p>
<p>“The $1 million recipients are not chosen by chance,” Gober said
Monday. “We know exactly who will be announced as the $1 million
recipient today and tomorrow.”</p>
<p>Chris Young, the director of America PAC, testified that the
recipients are vetted ahead of time, to “feel out their personality,
(and) make sure they were someone whose values aligned” with the
group.</p>
<p>Musk’s lawyers, in closing arguments, called it “core political
speech” given that participants sign a petition endorsing the U.S.
Constitution. They said Krasner’s legal bid to shut down the sweepstakes
under Pennsylvania law was moot because there would be no more
Pennsylvania winners before the program ends Tuesday.</p>
<p>Krasner believes the giveaways violates state election law and
contradict what Musk promised when he announced them during an
appearance with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump ’s campaign
in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, on Oct. 19: “We’re going to be awarding a
million dollars randomly to people who have signed the petition every
day from now until the election,” Musk vowed.</p>
<p>Young also acknowledged that the PAC made the recipients sign
nondisclosure agreements.</p>
<p>“They couldn’t really reveal the truth about how they got the money,
right?” asked Krasner lawyer John Summers.</p>
<p>“Sounds right,” Young said.</p>
<p>In an Oct. 20 social media post shown in court, Musk said anyone
signing the petition had “a daily chance of winning $1M!”</p>
<p>Summers grilled him on Musk’s use of both the words “chance” and
“randomly,” prompting Young, who also serves as the PAC’s treasurer, to
concede the latter was not “the word I would have selected.”</p>
<p>Young said the winners knew they would be called on stage but not
specifically that they would win the money.</p>
<p>Musk did not attend the hearing. He has committed more than $70
million to the super PAC to help Trump and other Republicans win in
November.</p>
<p>“This was all a political marketing masquerading as a lottery,”
Krasner testified Monday morning. “That’s what it is. A grift.”</p>
<p>Lawyers for Musk and the PAC said they do not plan to extend the
lottery beyond Tuesday. Krasner said the first three winners, starting
on Oct. 19, came from Pennsylvania in the days leading up to the state’s
Oct. 21 voter registration deadline.</p>
<p>Other winners came from the battleground states of Wisconsin, Nevada,
Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina and Michigan. It’s not clear if anyone
has yet received the money. The PAC pledged they would get it by
Nov. 30, according to an exhibit shown in court.</p>
<p>More than 1 million people from the seven states have registered for
the sweepstakes by signing a petition saying they support the right to
free speech and to bear arms, the first two amendments to the U.S.
Constitution. Krasner questioned how the PAC might use their data, which
it will have on hand well past the election.</p>
<p>“They were scammed for their information,” Krasner said. “It has
almost unlimited use.”</p>
<p>Krasner’s lawyer, John Summers, said Musk is “the heartbeat of
America PAC,” and the person announcing the winners and presenting the
checks.</p>
<p>“He was the one who presented the checks, albeit large cardboard
checks. We don’t really know if there are any real checks,” Summers
said.</p>
<p>Foglietta was presiding over the case at Philadelphia City Hall after
Musk and the PAC lost an effort to move it to federal court.</p>
<p>Krasner has said he could still consider criminal charges, as he’s
tasked with protecting both lotteries and the integrity of elections. In
the lawsuit, he said the defendants are “indisputably violating”
Pennsylvania’s lottery laws.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania remains a key battleground state with 19 electoral votes
and both Trump and Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris have
repeatedly visited the state, including stops planned Monday in the
final hours of the campaign.</p>
<p>Krasner — who noted that he has long driven a Tesla — said he could
also seek civil damages for the Pennsylvania registrants. Musk is the
CEO and largest shareholder of Tesla. He also owns the social media
platform X, where America PAC has published posts on the sweepstakes,
and the rocket ship maker SpaceX.</p>

arrests Turkish businessman accused of helping Venezuela skirt
sanctions</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>miami — A Turkish businessman was arrested Monday in Miami and
charged with helping Venezuela’s state-run oil company circumvent U.S.
sanctions.</p>
<p>Taskin Torlak, 37, was arrested while attempting to return to Turkey,
the Justice Department said in a statement.</p>
<p>According to court documents, Torlak operated several companies
involved in the shipment of sanctioned oil. Starting in 2020, he
allegedly started working with unnamed co-conspirators and companies
from Ukraine, China, Indonesia and elsewhere to transport Venezuela’s
crude oil at a time when most Western buyers stayed clear of the South
American country for fear of undermining U.S. sanctions aimed at
removing President Nicolas Maduro.</p>
<p>Torlak and his associates allegedly hid the identities of transaction
beneficiaries to enable U.S. banks to unknowingly process payments
related to the illegal oil transports.</p>
<p>“We could use one of the clean names to avoid money getting stuck
somewhere,” he allegedly wrote in communications with one of the
co-conspirators.</p>
<p>To evade detection, the chartered oil tankers frequently turned off
their automated tracking systems, a mandatory safety device, when
transporting the illegal Venezuelan crude. They also frequently changed
the vessels’ registry to fly so-called flags of convenience. </p>
<p>It wasn’t immediately possible to locate an attorney for Torlak. </p>
<p>The U.S. started ratcheting up sanctions on Venezuela following
Maduro’s first re-election in 2018, in which several key opponents were
barred from running. Since then, the self-declared socialist leader has
deepened his grip on power, this year claiming he won a third six-year
term in the face of evidence presented by his opponents that the vote
was stolen. The U.S. responded with another round of sanctions against
officials accused of obstructing the vote and carrying out human rights
abuses. </p>
<p>“The Justice Department will continue to hold accountable those
involved in criminal efforts to circumvent sanctions imposed on the
Maduro regime,” Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen said in a
statement.</p>

UN, US confronts Russia over North Korean troops for Ukraine</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — Russia refused to confirm its plans for North Korean
troops it reportedly plans to deploy in its fight against Ukraine,
during a confrontation with the United States Monday at the U.N.
Security Council.</p>
<p>“I heard the statement [of the Russian envoy], as did others in this
room, but the one question still remains that that statement does not
address, and that is whether there are DPRK troops on the ground in
Russia,” U.S. Deputy U.N. Ambassador Robert Wood told council members,
using the abbreviation for North Korea’s formal name.</p>
<p>“And my question still stands, and I hope that the Russian Federation
will answer that simple question,” he said.</p>
<p>Wood was referring to intelligence indicating that an estimated
10,000 North Korean troops have been sent to Russia for training and
deployment to fight alongside the Kremlin’s troops in Ukraine, with some
of the North Koreans believed to be heading to Ukraine in the coming
days. </p>
<p>“We’re not in a court here, and the question of the United States, in
the spirit of an interrogation, is not something I intend to answer,”
said Russian Deputy Ambassador Anna Evstigneeva.</p>
<p>U.S. officials estimate that more than a half-million Russian troops
have been killed or wounded in Ukraine since Russia launched its
full-scale illegal invasion on February 24, 2022. Russia, they say, is
now turning to pariah state North Korea to bolster its forces.</p>
<p>Ambassador Wood said the Russians have trained the North Koreans in
artillery and drone operations, and basic infantry operations.</p>
<p>“The nature of the training Russia is providing to these forces, to
include trench clearing, indicates Russia intends to use these forces in
front line operations,” he said.</p>
<p>South Korea’s envoy said Pyongyang is acting in a “more desperate and
dangerous” way recently, including the blowing up of rail and road links
between the two neighbors.</p>
<p>“And now the desperate DPRK is demanding more sacrifices from its own
people by dispatching troops to Russia,” said Ambassador JoonKook
Hwang.</p>
<p>William Pomeranz, a senior scholar at the Kennan Institute, told VOA
Monday that it is unclear how experienced and professional the North
Korean troops are.</p>
<p>“And we don’t know how they will react when faced in combat
positions. They have not been basically in a war for a long time,” he
said. “So, whether the North Koreans have the ability and the equipment
to maintain, to keep in the battlefield, is an open question.”</p>
<p>Western nations have questioned what the regime of North Korean
leader Kim Jong Un will get in return from Moscow for its troops. There
are concerns it could include advanced military technology, possibly for
its illicit nuclear and ballistic missile programs, in addition to
economic or other support.</p>
<p>“North Korea could benefit politically or diplomatically,” Naoko
Aoki, a political scientist at RAND Corporation told VOA. “And this is a
little bit more vague than the other more tangible support, but it is
nevertheless important, because Russia, as it has been doing, can shield
North Korea in the U.N. Security Council so that North Korea is not
faced with further sanctions for its nuclear and missile development,
for example, and also basically help [it] over the long run.” </p>
<p>She said that would support the Kim regime’s goal of remaining in
power and increasing its influence on the Korean Peninsula.</p>
<p>On March 28, Moscow took one such step to shield Pyongyang, using its
Security Council veto to shut down the panel that monitors
implementation of the council’s sanctions on North Korea — sanctions
that Russia previously voted for.</p>
<p>Ballistic missile launch</p>
<p>The Security Council met Monday to discuss Pyongyang’s October 30
missile launch of a solid fuel intercontinental ballistic missile
(ICBM).</p>
<p>“The latest ICBM is estimated to have landed in the waters near
Japan, around only 200 kilometers from the island of Hokkaido,” Japan’s
ambassador, Yamazaki Kazuyuki told the council. “This ICBM launch is
more threatening than ever, as it reached a height of over 7,000
kilometers and a flight time of about 86 minutes — the highest and
longest length trajectory of any missile that North Korea has launched
to date.”</p>
<p>He said its estimated range capability of 15,000 kilometers covers
three quarters of the planet, making it the gravest threat yet from
North Korea.</p>
<p>North Korea’s ambassador dismissed the council’s meeting as
“unlawful” and interference in its domestic affairs.</p>
<p>“Like all strategic weapons tests we have conducted so far, the test
launching of our ICBM Hwasong-19 this time, is a part of the exercise of
the just and legitimate right to self-defense to reliably safeguard
security of our state as well peace of the region involved,” said
Ambassador Kim Song.</p>
<p>Russia sides with North Korea</p>
<p>“The aim of convening a meeting is the same every time, to make yet
another step towards demonizing the DPRK,” said Ambassador Evstigneeva.
She blamed the United States for ratcheting up tension on the peninsula
because of its recent military exercises with South Korea.</p>
<p>South Korea’s ambassador questioned the timing of the latest launch
and strongly condemned it. </p>
<p>“Its intention could be to distract the world’s attention from its
troops in Russia, demonstrate themselves as larger than life, or gain
diplomatic leverage amid the U.S. presidential election,” said
Ambassador Hwang.</p>
<p>“Regardless of the intention, it was clearly an attempt to advance
its missile technology, which makes the launch another flagrant
violation of multiple Security Council resolutions,” he said. </p>
<p>VOA’s Kim Lewis contributed reporting for this story.</p>

Make no mistake: Picking the next president of the United States is the
single most important race of this election. However control of the U.S.
House and Senate, which voters will also decide on Tuesday, will either
help or hinder the next president’s agenda, whichever candidate takes
the office. It’s not a coincidence that a number of those critical races
involve candidates whose names will be familiar to the climate and

proved crucial in passing the Inflation Reduction Act, dreams of owning

Heatmap has covered</u></a>, there are also several public utilities
commission races, the results of which will have “an outsized influence
on the country’s energy mix.”
</p>
<p>
In many places, climate will be on the ballot even more directly. In
South Dakota, the debate over carbon capture and CO2 pipelines is being

decide if they want to incentivize the decarbonization of large
buildings with a natural gas tax; and Washingtonians will have

initiatives on the ballot thanks to a determined Republican millionaire.
</p>
<p>
Starting on Tuesday at 6 p.m., Heatmap will update a list of our most
anticipated climate-related races — 36 in all — with live results as
states and municipalities count the votes. For all the models, polls,
and punditry, it’s still impossible to know what will happen on Tuesday;
however, it’s no exaggeration to say we can be sure we’ll be living in a
different country come January 20, 2025. We can endlessly speculate
about <em><em>how</em></em> different it will be and what the climate
and energy transition will look like in the years ahead. But only
tomorrow knows.

<h2 id="renewable-energy-has-a-swing-voter-problem">Renewable Energy Has
a Swing Voter Problem</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-04, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NDA4OTcyOC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4ODIwNzU1MX0.UIuKzruloFghz925kDLGS7oq_V9LAJtDmF7iCMIhOgQ/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
In Texas,
<a href="https://www.oakrunsolarproject.com/" target="_blank"><u>the Oak
Run Solar Project</u></a> would have been a slam dunk.
</p>
<p>
Developers would install 800 megawatts of solar panels — enough to power
800,000 homes — across nine square miles of unused land. It would devote
some of its acreage to new farming practices that incorporate solar
panels. And it would sell its electricity cheaply — and profitably —
because it was near the state capital and because it could take
advantage of a pre-existing onsite connection to the regional power
grid.
</p>
<p>
But Oak Run wasn’t proposed in Texas. It was proposed in Ohio, and that
means it has faced enormous opposition. Ohio has some of the country’s
strictest restrictions on solar development, and 10 counties have
blocked solar development outright.
</p>
<p>
Although Madison County, where Oak Run was proposed, is not one of them,
the blowback to the project cost
<a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/18052024/ohio-solar-projects-politics/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
local Republican county commissioner</u></a> his job. Oak Run was
eventually approved by the state’s power siting board earlier this year,
but its opponents
<a href="https://heatmap.news/plus/the-fight/hotspots/oak-run-savion-madison-county-ohio" target="_self"><u>are
now appealing that decision</u></a> in the state’s Supreme Court.
</p>
<p>
Madison County, Ohio, also illustrates the political transformation that
has revolutionized the upper Midwest. The predominantly rural county
near the state’s capital, Columbus, has favored Republicans since the
1960s. But in recent decades it has swung hard to the right. In 2008,
Barack Obama won nearly 40% of the county’s vote. Eight years later,
Hillary Clinton picked up just 27%.
</p>
<p>
These two facts may seem like they have little to do with each other.
But they point to one of the biggest trends in clean energy development
across the country: The counties that voted for Barack Obama in 2008 and
then Donald Trump in 2016 are some of the worst places in the country to
permit and build renewable projects.
</p>
<p>
The size of a county’s swing from 2008 to 2016 is one of the biggest
predictors of whether a proposed wind or solar project will be contested
or blocked, according to a new Heatmap Pro analysis of more than 8,500
projects and local policies around the country.
</p>
<p>
The magnitude of that swing is by far the most important political
variable to emerge from
<a href="https://heatmap.news/pro" target="_blank">Heatmap Pro</a>’s
analysis of more than 60 risk factors influencing community support or
opposition to renewable projects. It is more strongly associated with a
given project’s success than whether a county votes for Democratic or
Republican candidates overall.
</p>
<p>
The only variables that are more closely correlated than the
2008-to-2016 swing are fundamental measures of a region’s population or
local economy, such as its median income, racial demographics, or
dominant industries. Towns and regions
<a href="https://heatmap.news/plus/the-fight/spotlight/solar-farmland" target="_self"><u>that
heavily depend on farming</u></a>, for instance, have become
particularly reluctant to accept new solar projects in recent years.
</p>
<p>
Heatmap Pro’s analysis focused not only on whether a county’s residents
support wind or solar projects in theory, but also on whether renewable
projects proposed in the area are canceled, contested, or exposed to
political turbulence. It surveyed more than 7,000 wind and solar
projects proposed and built across the United States since the 1990s.
</p>
<p>
Many of the counties with the largest Obama-to-Trump swings have passed
proposals meant to limit renewable development. Vermillion County in
Indiana — where more than a quarter of voters swung from Obama to Trump
— has
<a href="https://www.vermilliongov.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Commercial-Solar-Energy-Amendment-2020-15.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>an
extensive set of restrictions</u></a> on new solar projects. Solar
projects in Elk County, Pennsylvania, which saw a similar swing, have
<a href="https://wjactv.com/news/local/solar-farm-expansion-raises-concerns-over-prime-farmland-use-in-pennsylvania" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>also
turned out against</u></a> solar projects using up “prime farmland.”
</p>
<h3>
Why 2008 to 2016?
</h3>
<p>
There are a few reasons why the Obama-to-Trump swing might be associated
with more opposition to renewables.
</p>
<p>
In 2008, solar and wind were still frontier technologies and were not
price-competitive with fossil fuels. Although vaguely associated with
Democrats, politicians on both sides of the aisles
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2022/03/energy-independence-gas-prices/627117/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>championed
wind and solar</u></a> so as to wean the country off foreign oil.
</p>
<p>
But in the following decade, the U.S.
<a href="https://seia.org/research-resources/solar-industry-research-data/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>increased</u></a>
its solar capacity by roughly 100-fold, while it has
<a href="https://www.irena.org/Energy-Transition/Technology/Wind-energy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more
than doubled</u></a> its installed wind capacity.. Today, solar and wind
energy
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61242" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>are
major features</u></a> of the electricity system, and many Republicans
have openly embraced fossil fuels and cast doubt on the value of cleaner
alternatives.
</p>
<p>
To be sure, the Obama-to-Trump swing was influenced by other social and
economic factors, as well as a state’s specific political environment.
Leah Stokes, a UC Santa Barbara political scientist
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/wind-farm-protests-leah-stokes-pnas" target="_self"><u>who
has studied the growing local opposition to wind farms</u></a>, told me
that the correlation with Obama-Trump voters may originate from Trump’s
dominance of the upper Midwest in 2016. Because a small group of
anti-renewable advocates can change an entire region’s policies, that
could lead to more opposition to renewables in one part of the country
or another.
</p>
<p>
“Is there
<a href="https://www.distilled.earth/p/meet-the-man-fueling-clean-energy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
person</u></a>, or a network of people, who are going place by place
pushing these anti-solar and wind local laws? That would lead to a
geographic concentration,” she said.
</p>
<p>
Even within individual counties, the electorate wasn’t the same in 2016
as it was in 2008. Throughout the 2010s, tens of millions of Americans
moved around the country, with the largest net change moving from the
Northeast to the South. Cities became younger on average, while rural
areas and suburbs became older.
</p>
<p>
Even within counties, a different set of voters showed up to the polls
in each election. One reason why the 2012 election might not be
correlated with opposition to renewables is that many voters who voted
for Obama in 2008 skipped the next cycle. Those same voters — many of
whom were white and working class — showed back up in 2016 and
<a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2016/11/09/the_missing_white_voters_revisisted_132308.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>backed</u></a>
Trump.
</p>
<p>
What is driving the opposition to renewables? Perhaps a county’s swing
against renewable energy is happening precisely because voters there are
persuadable. From 2008 to 2016, many voters in these counties changed
their minds about which candidate or political party to support. As they
shifted their stance to the right, they also adopted more seemingly
Republican views about wind and solar development. Donald Trump has
distinguished himself by his embrace of fossil fuels and climate change
skepticism — perhaps as voters come to support him, they also adopt his
positions.
</p>
<p>
What’s interesting, however, is that deep red counties that have not
seen a political shift — places that backed, say, McCain and Romney by
roughly the same margin as they backed Trump in 2016 — continue to build
wind and solar at a good clip. Texas, for instance, is the
<a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/texas-goes-green-how-oil-country-became-the-renewable-energy-leader" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>No. 1
state for renewable deployment</u></a>. A county’s partisanship, in
other words, is not as good a predictor of its opposition to renewables
as its <em><em>swinginess.</em></em>
</p>
<p>
Edgar Virguez, an energy systems engineer at the Carnegie Institution
for Science at Stanford University, has studied what drives opposition
to renewables in North Carolina. He told me that some of the same
factors that predict a county’s Trump support — such as its population
density and education level — also predict whether that county has
enacted a local restriction on renewable energy.
</p>
<p>
When he and his colleagues studied local policies in North Carolina,
they found that lower density and less educated counties “had
significantly higher reductions in the land available for solar
development” when compared with denser or more educated counties, he
said. Once a county has fewer than 35 people per square mile, or when
less than 20% of the population has a bachelor’s degree, the number of
restrictions on local land use shot up. That’s a problem for
decarbonization, he added, because less dense counties also usually have
the best and most affordable land available for solar development.
</p>
<p>
That finding may not hold true in other states. Heatmap, for instance,
has found that whiter and more educated counties are more likely to
oppose renewables. And to some degree, less dense counties are exactly
where you’d expect to see more solar and wind projects get built — and
thus more local policies restricting them pop up. But it is nonetheless
not great news for advocates, given that a couple of America’s political
institutions — namely, the Senate and the Electoral College — favor
rural voters or Midwestern states. If the trend takes root, then it
could eventually curtail renewable development across the country. That
question — and many others — will partly be decided in this week’s
presidential election.

<h2 id="what-does-harris-mean-by-an-opportunity-economy">What does
Harris mean by an opportunity economy?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>As U.S. voters remain largely dissatisfied with the economy under
President Joe Biden, Kamala Harris has sought to define her own economic
policy under the label of an opportunity economy. But what does that
term mean, and how different is it than what Biden has offered?</p>
<p>Among many contentious topics influencing the 2024 election, the
economy remains the number one issue for a majority of voters. With
Americans reporting feeling worse off financially despite positive
economic trends, Vice President Harris has sought to distinguish her own
economic platform from that of the administration in which she currently
serves.</p>
<p>President Biden’s economic platform has been characterized by support
for unions and American industries, efforts to cancel student debt and
attempts to pass major disaster recovery and infrastructure packages.
Harris has aimed to build on these policies while doing more to address
concerns over rising prices due to inflation, and her economic program
has focused largely on ways to lower costs for Americans.</p>
<p>These proposals include a ban on price-gouging, a price cap on
prescription drugs and subsidizing the construction of new homes in
hopes that increasing supply will help stem rising housing costs.</p>
<p>Harris has also sought to make the case to voters that tariffs
proposed by her rival, former President Donald Trump, will exacerbate
price increases as companies pass higher import costs on to consumers.
However, the vice president has also proposed tariffs in strategic
industries such as energy and is likely to retain tariffs on Chinese
goods maintained under the Biden administration.</p>
<p>The Harris campaign’s frequent references to an “opportunity economy”
combine the Democratic Party’s traditional support for social safety
nets and consumer protection regulations with an entrepreneurial message
usually associated with Republicans. Besides expanding the child tax
credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit, the vice president has echoed
Trump’s proposal for eliminating taxes on tips earned by service
workers.</p>
<p>Harris has also announced plans to provide more loans for new small
businesses and to ensure that historically disadvantaged groups can
benefit economically from the growing legal cannabis industry.</p>
<p>Harris’ California background and connections to Silicon Valley also
suggest that she may be more friendly to the tech industry and the
emerging cryptocurrency market. It remains to be seen whether a Harris
administration would replace Lina Khan of the Federal Trade Commission
and Gary Gensler of the Securities and Exchange Commission – two Biden
appointees known for their tough regulatory approach.</p>
<p>The vice president’s economic plan has received a mixed reception.
Many economists believe Trump’s proposed tax cuts and deregulation may
help spur economic growth, but a majority polled by The Wall Street
Journal have predicted that Harris’ less aggressive trade policy will be
better for curbing inflation and the deficit.</p>
<p>When it comes to the general public, however, Harris is still
perceived as less capable of handling the economy than Trump, although
the margin of Trump’s advantage has shrunk as the election draws
near.</p>

<h2
id="trump-lawsuits-complaints-target-media-in-closing-days-of-campaign">Trump
lawsuits, complaints target media in closing days of campaign</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — In the last week of the U.S. presidential campaign,
candidate Donald Trump sued CBS News and filed a complaint with the
Federal Election Commission against The Washington Post newspaper.  </p>
<p>The cases are the latest high-profile conflicts between the former
president and news outlets that he often accuses of bias.  </p>
<p>Trump sued CBS over an interview of Vice President Kamala Harris on
the network’s “60 Minutes” program that aired in early October. Trump
had also agreed to give an interview to “60 Minutes” before backing
out.</p>
<p>Filed in Texas on Thursday, the lawsuit alleges that the network
aired two different responses from Harris about the Israel-Hamas
war.</p>
<p>In a statement, CBS said “60 Minutes” gave an excerpt of the
interview to the CBS show “Face the Nation” that used a longer section
of her answer than what aired on “60 Minutes.”</p>
<p>But Trump’s lawsuit — which calls for a jury trial and $10 billion in
damages — alleges that CBS violated a Texas law that prohibits deceptive
acts in the conduct of business.</p>
<p>A CBS spokesperson told VOA the interview was not doctored. The
lawsuit “is completely without merit and we will vigorously defend
against it,” the spokesperson said in an email.</p>
<p>Trump on Thursday also filed a complaint with the Federal Election
Commission alleging that The Washington Post illegally contributed to
the Harris campaign.  </p>
<p>The complaint alleges a social media ad campaign highlighting the
newspaper’s critical coverage of the former president constituted
“illegal corporate in-kind contributions and unreported last-minute
independent expenditures.” Trump’s legal representatives allege the ad
campaign meant the Post was “acting like any other partisan player in
the election process.”  </p>
<p>A Post spokesperson told VOA that promoted posts on social media
reflect high-performing content from the newspaper</p>
<p>“We believe allegations suggesting this routine media practice is
improper are without merit,” the spokesperson said in an email.</p>
<p>Gabe Rottman, policy director at the Reporters Committee for Freedom
of the Press, dismissed the case against the Post. </p>
<p>“Advertising by news organizations is a legitimate, routine press
function and receives strong First Amendment protections in the courts,”
he told VOA in a text message.  </p>
<p>Trump’s campaign and office did not reply to VOA’s multiple requests
for comment on the recent legal actions or the former president’s press
freedom record for this story. </p>
<p>Power to revoke broadcasting licenses</p>
<p>Trump has had a contentious relationship with some news outlets since
running for president in 2015. Often referring to journalists as “the
enemy of the people,” he has complained on social media and in speeches
about ideological bias and unfair treatment of conservative voices,
while also championing media that reflect his views. </p>
<p>He has pledged to jail journalists who do not name confidential
sources on stories he believed to have national security implication,
and suggested changing First Amendment protections to allow punishing
people who burn the American flag or criticize Supreme Court judges.
 </p>
<p>Trump had previously threatened to revoke CBS’s broadcast license if
elected. On his social media platform, Truth Social, he said “60
Minutes” had “created the Greatest Fraud in Broadcast History” and that
CBS should lose its license because it is “corrupt.” </p>
<p>Following his September debate against Harris on ABC News, Trump
called for that network’s broadcasting license to be revoked over what
he described as “unfair” fact-checking.</p>
<p>And as president in 2017, Trump threatened to revoke NBC’s
broadcasting license after the outlet reported a dispute between the
then-president and his military advisers about the size of the nuclear
arsenal.</p>
<p>In an October statement, the chair of the Federal Communications
Commission, which issues licenses, said the FCC “does not and will not
revoke licenses for broadcast stations simply because a political
candidate disagrees with or dislikes content or coverage.”  </p>
<p>Many of Trump’s supporters applaud his attacks on the media,
reflecting in part the steep erosion of trust in the press that public
opinion polls have tracked among many Americans for years.</p>
<p>But media analysts say Trump’s attacks echo how leaders in countries
like Hungary have undermined journalistic norms.</p>
<p>Clayton Weimers, the head of the U.S. office of Reporters Without
Borders, or RSF, said the lawsuit against CBS “looks like a publicity
stunt.”</p>
<p>But, he said, “It reinforces the very real threats that Trump has
issued to use the U.S. government to punish media outlets he doesn’t
like should he regain the White House.”</p>
<p>Leading up to and during his time as president, Trump published more
than 2,000 posts on social media that the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker
classified as anti-media. After Trump left the White House, his
anti-media rhetoric has continued.</p>
<p>Between September 1 and October 24, Trump verbally insulted, attacked
or threatened the media at least 108 times in public, RSF found in a
study. RSF has not conducted a similar study about Vice President Harris
because she does not make those kinds of anti-media statements, Weimers
said.</p>
<p>“By just accepting that as a piece of this political moment, I do
think there’s a risk that the American public has grown numb to how
serious it is, what an aberration it is, and how dangerous it could be
going forward,” Weimers said in a phone interview.  </p>
<p>Trump’s public attacks against the media frequently play well with
his supporters. At many of his rallies, the candidate often pauses after
criticizing the media to give his supporters a chance to jeer at the
reporters who are present.</p>
<p>Last month, Trump’s presidential campaign sent VOA a statement that
Republican National Committee spokesperson Taylor Rogers originally
provided to the conservative news site The Daily Caller. In it, Rogers
described Trump as a “champion for free speech” and said that “everyone
was safer under President Trump, including journalists” because of
“commonsense law.”</p>
<p>Newspaper endorsements</p>
<p>Record-low distrust in media in the U.S. is what billionaire and
Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos pointed to in an op-ed last week to
explain why the newspaper would not make an endorsement in this year’s
presidential election. </p>
<p>Days before the Post’s announcement, the billionaire owner of the Los
Angeles Times said his newspaper would not endorse a candidate so as not
to worsen political divisions.</p>
<p>For some media analysts, the decisions by the Post and the Los
Angeles Times have only crystallized concerns about what a second Trump
presidency would mean for press freedom in the United States.</p>
<p>Marty Baron, the Post’s former executive editor, said he thinks it
would have been fine if the Post made this decision a year or two ago.
But announcing the decision so close to the election was a “betrayal of
core principles of the Post,” Baron told VOA in a phone interview.  </p>
<p>“This is an invitation to further intimidation and bullying, and I
think that that’s what we would likely see if Trump were to be back in
the White House,” Baron added.</p>
<p>Margaret Sullivan, a media columnist with The Guardian who previously
worked as a media columnist at the Post, said the decision does not
reflect the newspaper’s ideals.</p>
<p>“This seemed to be a move from above that wasn’t about the content of
the endorsement,” she told VOA in a phone interview. </p>
<p>Baron and Sullivan told VOA they’re concerned that the
non-endorsement is a harbinger of what’s to come for press freedom if
Trump is re-elected.  </p>
<p>“I’m very concerned about intimidation of the press,” Sullivan said.
“And frankly, I’m very concerned about the press preemptively acting
like they’ve been intimidated when they have the ability to stand
firm.”</p>
<p>Both of Trump’s legal challenges against the Post and CBS are
expected to take weeks or months before they reach a resolution.</p>

costs of Spain’s devastating floods</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-04, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
From the BBC World Service: More than 200 people were killed in the
floods in Valencia, Spain — the worst in the country for decades. Now,

<li>Canada to propose plan to cap oil and gas emissions
</h3>
<p>
Canada, the fourth-largest oil producer in the world, will publish a
proposal today to cap greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel energy
production. Energy is Canada’s highest-polluting sector, with oil and
gas accounting for a quarter of all emissions and producing “more than
double the greenhouse gas pollution than all other industries combined,”
according to Hermine Landry, a spokeswoman for Environment Minister
Steven Guilbeault. Landry
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/canada-unveil-proposed-emissions-cap-oil-gas-sector-monday-2024-11-03/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_w5bHuGnm3BxbmeNfomJb2hs-MxSU7al-IInzGT7dCdFrgBjnvpV8MsPvYDLA4y3mckFUp" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a>

the cap would likely nudge companies to cut production. Canada has a
goal of curbing emissions by at least 40% compared to 2005 levels by the
end of the decade. Whether this new proposal comes into effect will
depend largely on the outcome of the next election, set to be held in
late 2025.

<h2 id="music-titan-quincy-jones-dies-at-91">Music titan Quincy Jones
dies at 91</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Quincy Jones, the multi-talented music titan whose vast legacy ranged
from producing Michael Jackson’s historic “Thriller” album to writing
prize-winning film and television scores and collaborating with Frank
Sinatra, Ray Charles and hundreds of other recording artists, has died
at 91. </p>
<p>Jones’ publicist, Arnold Robinson, says he died Sunday night at his
home in the Bel Air section of Los Angeles, surrounded by his
family. </p>
<p>“Tonight, with full but broken hearts, we must share the news of our
father and brother Quincy Jones’ passing,” the family said in a
statement. “And although this is an incredible loss for our family, we
celebrate the great life that he lived and know there will never be
another like him.” </p>
<p>Jones rose from running with gangs on the South Side of Chicago to
the very heights of show business, becoming one of the first Black
executives to thrive in Hollywood and amassing an extraordinary musical
catalog that includes some of the richest moments of American rhythm and
song. For years, it was unlikely to find a music lover who did not own
at least one record with his name on it, or a leader in the
entertainment industry and beyond who did not have some connection to
him. </p>
<p>Jones kept company with presidents and foreign leaders, movie stars
and musicians, philanthropists and business leaders. He toured with
Count Basie and Lionel Hampton, arranged records for Sinatra and Ella
Fitzgerald, composed the soundtracks for “Roots” and “In the Heat of the
Night,” organized President Bill Clinton’s first inaugural celebration
and oversaw the all-star recording of “We Are the World,” the 1985
charity record for famine relief in Africa. </p>
<p>Lionel Richie, who co-wrote “We Are the World” and was among the
featured singers, would call Jones “the master orchestrator.” </p>
<p>In a career which began when records were still played on vinyl at 78
rpm, top honors likely go to his productions with Jackson: “Off the
Wall,” “Thriller” and “Bad” were albums near-universal in their style
and appeal. Jones’ versatility and imagination helped set off the
explosive talents of Jackson as he transformed from child star to the
“King of Pop.” On such classic tracks as “Billie Jean” and “Don’t Stop
’Til You Get Enough,” Jones and Jackson fashioned a global soundscape
out of disco, funk, rock, pop, R&amp;B and jazz and African chants. For
“Thriller,” some of the most memorable touches originated with Jones,
who recruited Eddie Van Halen for a guitar solo on the genre-fusing
“Beat It” and brought in Vincent Price for a ghoulish voiceover on the
title track. </p>
<p>“Thriller” sold more than 20 million copies in 1983 alone and has
contended with the Eagles’ “Greatest Hits 1971-1975” among others as the
best-selling album of all time. </p>
<p>“If an album doesn’t do well, everyone says ‘it was the producers
fault’; so if it does well, it should be your ‘fault,’ too,” Jones said
in an interview with the Library of Congress in 2016. “The tracks don’t
just all of a sudden appear. The producer has to have the skill,
experience and ability to guide the vision to completion.” </p>
<p>The list of his honors and awards fills 18 pages in his 2001
autobiography “Q”, including 27 Grammys at the time (now 28), an
honorary Academy Award (now two) and an Emmy for “Roots.” He also
received France’s Legion d’Honneur, the Rudolph Valentino Award from the
Republic of Italy and a Kennedy Center tribute for his contributions to
American culture. He was the subject of a 1990 documentary, “Listen Up:
The Lives of Quincy Jones” and a 2018 film by daughter Rashida Jones.
His memoir made him a best-selling author.</p>

id="boeing-machinists-hold-contract-vote-that-could-end-their-7-week-strike">Boeing
machinists hold contract vote that could end their 7-week strike</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Unionized factory workers at Boeing are voting Monday whether to
accept a contract offer or to continue their strike, which has lasted
more than seven weeks and shut down production of most Boeing passenger
planes.</p>
<p>A vote to ratify the contract would clear the way for the aerospace
giant to resume airplane production and bring in much-needed cash. If
members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace
Workers vote for a third time to reject Boeing’s offer, it would plunge
the company into further financial peril and uncertainty.</p>
<p>In its latest proposed contract, Boeing is offering pay raises of 38%
over four years, as well as ratification and productivity bonuses. IAM
District 751, which represents Boeing workers in the Pacific Northwest,
endorsed the proposal, which is slightly more generous than one the
machinists voted down nearly two weeks ago.</p>
<p>“It is time for our members to lock in these gains and confidently
declare victory,” the union district said in scheduling Monday’s vote.
“We believe asking members to stay on strike longer wouldn’t be right as
we have achieved so much success.”</p>
<p>Union officials said they think they have gotten all they can though
negotiations and a strike, and that if the current proposal is rejected,
future offers from Boeing might be worse. They expect to announce the
result of the vote Monday night.</p>
<p>Boeing says average annual pay for machinists is $75,608 and would
rise to $119,309 in four years under the current offer. </p>
<p>Pensions were a key issue for workers who rejected the company’s
previous offers in September and October. In its new offer, Boeing did
not meet their demand to restore a pension plan that was frozen nearly a
decade ago. </p>
<p>If machinists ratify the latest offer, they would return to work by
Nov. 12, according to the union.</p>
<p>The strike began Sept. 13 with an overwhelming 94.6% rejection of
Boeing’s offer to raise pay by 25% over four years — far less than the
union’s original demand for 40% wage increases over three years.</p>
<p>Machinists voted down another offer — 35% raises over four years, but
still no revival of pensions — on Oct. 23, the same day Boeing reported
a third-quarter loss of more than $6 billion. However, the offer
received 36% support, up from 5% for the mid-September proposal, making
Boeing leaders believe they were close to a deal.</p>
<p>Boeing says average annual pay for machinists is $75,608 and would
rise to $119,309 in four years under the current offer.</p>
<p>In addition to a slightly larger pay increases, the proposed contract
includes a $12,000 contract ratification bonus, up from $7,000 in the
previous offer, and larger company contributions to employees’ 401(k)
retirement accounts.</p>
<p>Boeing also promises to build its next airline plane in the Seattle
area. Union officials fear the company may withdraw the pledge if
workers reject the new offer.</p>
<p>The strike drew the attention of the Biden administration. Acting
Labor Secretary Julie Su intervened in the talks several times,
including last week.</p>
<p>The labor standoff — the first strike by Boeing machinists since an
eight-week walkout in 2008 — is the latest setback in a volatile year
for the company.</p>
<p>Boeing came under several federal investigations after a door plug
blew off a 737 Max plane during an Alaska Airlines flight in January.
Federal regulators put limits on Boeing airplane production that they
said would last until they felt confident about manufacturing safety at
the company.</p>
<p>The door plug incident renewed concerns about the safety of the 737
Max. Two of the plane’s crashed less than five months apart in 2018 and
2019, killing 346 people. The CEO whose effort to fix the company failed
announced in March that he would step down. In July, Boeing agreed to
plead guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud for deceiving regulators who
approved the 737 Max.</p>
<p>As the strike dragged on, new CEO Kelly Ortberg announced about
17,000 layoffs and a stock sale to prevent the company’s credit rating
from being cut to junk status. S&amp;P and Fitch Ratings said last week
that the $24.3 billion in stock and other securities will cover upcoming
debt payments and reduce the risk of a credit downgrade.</p>
<p>The strike has created a cash crunch by depriving Boeing of money it
gets when delivering new planes to airlines. The walkout at Seattle-area
factories stopped production of the 737 Max, Boeing’s best-selling
plane, and the 777 or “triple-seven” jet and the cargo-carrying version
of its 767 plane.</p>
<p>Ortberg has conceded that trust in Boeing has declined, the company
has too much debt, and “serious lapses in our performance” have
disappointed many airline customers. But, he says, the company’s
strengths include a backlog of airplane orders valued at a half-trillion
dollars.</p>

storms injure at least 11 and leave thousands without power</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>OKLAHOMA CITY — Severe storms and tornadoes battered Oklahoma early
Sunday, tossing cars and ripping roofs off buildings in the middle of
the night and leaving tens of thousands of homes and businesses without
power. Among numerous injuries, 11 people required hospitalization,
authorities said.</p>
<p>Much of the damage was reported in and around the state capital of
Oklahoma City, near the state’s center, but also scattered elsewhere
around the state. The early morning storms set off tornado warnings that
extended south to the Arkansas state line. Heavy rains caused flash
flooding in some areas and one lightning-sparked house fire was
reported.</p>
<p>More than 99,000 Oklahoma homes and businesses lost power during the
overnight storms. By late Sunday afternoon, that number was reduced to
around 24,000. No fatalities had been reported.</p>
<p>Richard Thompson, forecast chief for the National Weather Service
Storm Prediction Center in Oklahoma, said he believes six or more
tornadoes hit the state overnight. Meanwhile, forecasters warned state
residents to brace for more heavy rain and possible severe weather
through Monday.</p>
<p>“We’re not done with it yet,” he said.</p>
<p>A tornado watch for much of the central and southeast part of
Oklahoma was in effect until 8 p.m. Sunday. Other areas were under
thunderstorm or flood watches.</p>
<p>In the town of Choctaw, east of Oklahoma City, firefighters and
police officers went door to door Sunday morning to ask about
injuries.</p>
<p>“It leveled a complete neighborhood in Choctaw,” the town’s mayor,
Chad Allcox, told The Associated Press. He added that debris hindered
search and rescue efforts. “Power lines are down everywhere … a lot of
the roads are blocked, hard to get through. Very large trees blocking
roadways.”</p>
<p>Oklahoma City Fire Department spokesman Scott Douglas told the AP
that heavy rain and the lingering threat of tornadoes in the early
morning darkness complicated early search and rescue efforts. He
described a first sweep of hard-hit areas around 1:30 a.m.</p>
<p>Emergency workers had to free two people from an overturned mobile
home, including a woman injured when an air conditioner landed on her
leg, Douglas said.</p>
<p>The scale of the damage came into focus as daylight broke. Local
television footage showed downed power lines, walls peeled off homes,
overturned vehicles and neighborhood streets littered with debris.</p>
<p>Douglas said 11 people were transported to hospitals with injuries
that were not life-threatening. “There were some other minor injuries,
some walking wounded, that were going to get treatment on their own,”
Douglas said.</p>
<p>Allcox said early weather warnings and tornado sirens likely saved
lives.</p>

tech firms warn Vietnam’s planned law to hamper data centers, social
media</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>HANOI, Vietnam — U.S. tech companies have warned Vietnam’s government
that a draft law to tighten rules on data protection and limit data
transfers abroad would hamper social media platforms and data center
operators from growing their businesses in the country.</p>
<p>The Southeast Asian nation with a population of 100 million is one of
the world’s largest markets for Facebook and other online platforms, and
is aiming to exponentially increase its data center industry with
foreign investment in coming years.</p>
<p>The draft law “will make it challenging for tech companies, social
media platforms and data center operators to reach the customers that
rely on them daily,” said Jason Oxman, who chairs the Information
Technology Industry Council (ITI), a trade association representing big
tech companies including Meta, Google and data centers operator
Equinix.</p>
<p>The draft law, being discussed in parliament, is also designed to
ease authorities’ access to information and was urged by the ministry of
public security, Vietnamese and foreign officials said.</p>
<p>The ministry of public security and the information ministry did not
respond to attempts to contact them via email and phone.</p>
<p>Vietnam’s parliament is discussing the law in its current month-long
session and is scheduled to pass it on Nov. 30 “if eligible,” according
to its program, which is subject to changes.</p>
<p>Existing Vietnamese regulations already limit cross-border transfers
of data under some circumstances, but they are rarely enforced.</p>
<p>It is unclear how the new law, if adopted, would impact foreign
investment in the country. Reuters reported in August that Google was
considering setting up a large data center in southern Vietnam before
the draft law was presented in parliament.</p>
<p>Research firm BMI had said Vietnam could become a major regional
player in the data center industry as limits on foreign ownership are
set to end next year.</p>
<p>Among the provisions of the draft law is prior authorization for the
transfer overseas of “core data” and “important data,” which are
currently vaguely defined.</p>
<p>“That will hinder foreign business operations,” Oxman told
Reuters.</p>
<p>Tech companies and other firms favor cross-border data flows to cut
costs and improve services, but multiple jurisdictions, including the
European Union and China, have limited those transfers, saying that
allows them to better protect privacy and sensitive information.</p>
<p>Under the draft law, companies will have to share data with Vietnam’s
ruling Communist Party and state organizations in multiple, vaguely
defined cases including for “fulfilling a specific task in the public
interest.”</p>
<p>The U.S. tech industry has raised concerns with Vietnamese
authorities over “the undue expansion of government access to data,”
Oxman said.</p>
<p>The new law “would cause significant compliance challenges for most
private sector companies,” said Adam Sitkoff, executive director of the
American Chamber of Commerce in Hanoi, noting talks were underway to
persuade authorities to “reconsider the rushed legislative process” for
the law.</p>

id="puerto-rico-prepares-for-election-day-as-a-third-party-candidate-makes-history">Puerto
Rico prepares for Election Day as a third-party candidate makes
history</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — The two parties that have dominated Puerto
Rican politics for decades are losing their grip as they face the
stiffest competition yet from a younger generation fed up with the
island’s corruption, chronic power outages and mismanagement of public
funds.</p>
<p>For the first time in the island’s governor’s race, a third-party
candidate has a powerful second lead in the polls ahead of the U.S.
territory’s election Tuesday — and some experts say there’s a
possibility he could win.</p>
<p>“This election is already historic,” said political analyst and
university professor Jorge Schmidt Nieto. “It already marks a before and
an after.”</p>
<p>Juan Dalmau is running for Puerto Rico’s Independence Party and the
Citizen Victory Movement, established in 2019. A Gaither international
poll this month shows Dalmau closing in on Jenniffer González, a member
of the New Progressive Party and Puerto Rico’s representative in
Congress. She beat Gov. Pedro Pierluisi in their party’s primary in
June.</p>
<p>Gaither’s poll shows Dalmau with 29% of support versus González’s 31%
as he nearly caught up with her since a different poll in July showed
him with only 24% compared with González’s 43%. Coming in third was
Jesús Manuel Ortiz, of the Popular Democratic Party, followed by Javier
Jiménez of Project Dignity, a conservative party created in 2019.</p>
<p>Under pressure</p>
<p>Puerto Rican politics revolve around the island’s status, and up
until 2016, the New Progressive Party, which supports statehood, and the
Popular Democratic Party, which supports the status quo, would split at
least 90% of all votes during general elections, Schmidt said.</p>
<p>But that year, U.S. Congress created a federal control board to
oversee Puerto Rico’s finances after the government announced it was
unable to pay a more than $70 billion public debt load. In 2017, Puerto
Rico filed for the biggest U.S. municipal bankruptcy in history.</p>
<p>The debt was accrued through decades of corruption, mismanagement and
excessive borrowing, with Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority still
struggling to restructure its more than $9 billion debt, the largest of
any government agency.</p>
<p>Puerto Ricans have largely rejected and resented the board, created a
year before Hurricane Maria slammed into the island as a powerful
Category 4 storm, razing the electrical grid.</p>
<p>In 2020, Pierluisi won but received only 33% of votes. His opponent
from the Popular Democratic Party received 32%. It marked the first time
either party failed to reach 40% of votes.</p>
<p>The power outages that have persisted since the elections, coupled
with the slow pace of hurricane reconstruction, have frustrated and
angered voters.</p>
<p>Under Pierluisi, the government signed contracts with two companies,
Luma Energy and Genera PR, which together oversee the generation,
transmission and distribution of power. Outages have persisted, with the
companies blaming a grid that was already crumbling before the hurricane
hit due to a lack of maintenance and investment.</p>
<p>“Disastrous things have occurred during this four-year term,
especially with the electric energy,” Schmidt said. “It has affected
everyone, regardless of social class.”</p>
<p>Voters, he said, are viewing Tuesday’s elections “as a moment of
revenge.”</p>
<p>Dalmau said he would oust both companies in an “organized fashion”
within six months if he becomes governor. Ortiz said he would cancel
Luma’s contract, while González has called for the creation of an
“energy czar” that would review potential Luma contractual breaches
while another operator is found.</p>
<p>However, no contract can be canceled without prior approval of the
federal control board and Puerto Rico’s Energy Bureau.</p>
<p>The candidates also are under pressure to create affordable housing,
lower power bills and the general cost of living, reduce violent crimes,
boost Puerto Rico’s economy, with the island locked out of capital
markets since 2015, and improve a crumbling health care system as
thousands of doctors flock to the U.S. mainland.</p>
<p>Dalmau, who suspended his campaign for two weeks in mid-October after
his wife had emergency brain surgery, also has said he would eliminate
tax breaks for wealthy U.S. citizens from the mainland.</p>
<p>Apathy dominates</p>
<p>Despite their promises to turn Puerto Rico around, candidates face
persistent voter apathy.</p>
<p>In 2008, 1.9 million out of 2.5 million registered voters
participated in that year’s election, compared with 1.3 million out of
2.3 million in 2020.</p>
<p>This year, nearly 99,000 new voters registered and more than 87,000
reactivated their status, according to Puerto Rico’s State Elections
Commission.</p>
<p>“A much higher number was expected,” Schmidt said.</p>
<p>He noted that those middle age and older favor González and her
pro-statehood party, while those younger than 45 “overwhelmingly” favor
Dalmau, which means that if a majority of young voters participate on
Tuesday and fewer older ones do so, he might have a chance of
winning.</p>
<p>The Bad Bunny factor</p>
<p>The months leading up to the Nov. 5 elections have been
contentious.</p>
<p>Reggaetón superstar Bad Bunny paid for dozens of billboard ads
criticizing Puerto Rico’s two main parties. In response, the governor’s
New Progressive Party financed a billboard ad suggesting an obscenity in
reference to Bad Bunny.</p>
<p>On Friday, the singer published a page-long letter in a local
newspaper deriding González’s pro-statehood party.</p>
<p>While the artist has not endorsed any local officials, the sole
person he recently began following on Instagram was Dalmau.</p>
<p>On Sunday, he briefly appeared at Dalmau’s closing campaign. A hush
fell over a crowd of tens of thousands of people as Bad Bunny spoke
before singing, saying he doesn’t endorse a specific candidate or
party.</p>
<p>“My party is the people. … My party is Puerto Rico,” he said as he
later praised the alliance between Puerto Rico’s Independence Party and
the Citizen Victory Movement.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a so-called “cemetery of corruption” was set up Thursday
in the capital, San Juan, featuring large black-and-white pictures of
nearly a dozen politicians from the island’s two main parties who have
been charged or sentenced by federal authorities in recent years. It was
created by Eva Prados with the Citizen Victory Movement, who is running
for Puerto Rico’s House. By Friday, police reported that the pictures
were destroyed or stolen.</p>
<p>As the race heats up, the number of formal complaints about alleged
electoral crimes also has increased. These include people who say they
received confirmations for early voting when they made no such
request.</p>
<p>A persistent question</p>
<p>Voters on Tuesday also will be asked for a seventh time what Puerto
Rico’s political status should be.</p>
<p>The nonbinding referendum will feature three choices: statehood,
independence and independence with free association, under which issues
like foreign affairs, U.S. citizenship and use of the U.S. dollar would
be negotiated.</p>
<p>Regardless of the outcome, a change in status requires approval from
the U.S. Congress.</p>
<p>The push for a change in status doesn’t depend on whether Kamala
Harris or Donald Trump win in the U.S. mainland.</p>

id="federal-judge-lets-iowa-challenge-voter-rolls-may-affect-naturalized-citizens">Federal
judge lets Iowa challenge voter rolls; may affect naturalized
citizens</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>DES MOINES, Iowa — A federal judge ruled Sunday that Iowa can
continue challenging the validity of hundreds of ballots from potential
noncitizens even though critics said the effort threatens the voting
rights of people who’ve recently become U.S. citizens.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Stephen Locher, an appointee of President Joe
Biden, sided with the state in a lawsuit filed by the American Civil
Liberties Union in the Iowa capital of Des Moines on behalf of the
League of Latin American Citizens of Iowa and four recently naturalized
citizens. The four were on the state’s list of questionable
registrations to be challenged by local elections officials.</p>
<p>The state’s Republican attorney general and secretary of state argued
that investigating and potentially removing 2,000 names would prevent
illegal voting by noncitizens. GOP officials across the U.S. have made
possible voting by noncitizen immigrants a key election-year talking
point even though it is rare. Their focus has come with former President
Donald Trump falsely suggesting that his opponents already are
committing fraud to prevent his return to the White House.</p>
<p>In his ruling Sunday, Locher pointed to a U.S. Supreme Court decision
four days prior that allowed Virginia to resume a similar purge of its
voter registration rolls even though it was impacting some U.S.
citizens. He also cited the Supreme Court’s recent refusal to review a
Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision on state electoral laws surrounding
provisional ballots. Those Supreme Court decisions advise lower courts
to “act with great caution before awarding last-minute injunctive
relief,” he wrote.</p>
<p>Locher also said the state’s effort does not remove anyone from the
voter rolls, but rather requires some voters to use provisional
ballots.</p>
<p>In a statement Sunday, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, a Republican,
celebrated the ruling.</p>
<p>“Today’s ruling is a victory for election integrity,” Reynolds said.
“In Iowa, while we encourage all citizens to vote, we will enforce the
law and ensure those votes aren’t cancelled out by the illegal vote of a
non-citizen.”</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the ACLU said the organization did not immediately
have a comment.</p>
<p>After Locher had a hearing in the ACLU’s lawsuit Friday, Secretary of
State Paul Pate and state Attorney General Brenna Bird issued a
statement saying that Iowa had about 250 noncitizens registered to vote,
but the Biden administration wouldn’t provide data about them.</p>
<p>Pate told reporters last month that his office was forced to rely
upon a list of potential noncitizens from the Iowa Department of
Transportation. It named people who registered to vote or voted after
identifying themselves as noncitizens living in the U.S. legally when
they previously sought driver’s licenses.</p>
<p>“Today’s court victory is a guarantee for all Iowans that their votes
will count and not be canceled out by illegal votes,” Bird said in the
statement issued after Sunday’s decision.</p>
<p>But ACLU attorneys said Iowa officials were conceding that most of
the people on the list are eligible to vote and shouldn’t have been
included. They said the state was violating naturalized citizens’ voting
rights by wrongfully challenging their registrations and investigating
them if they cast ballots.</p>
<p>Pate issued his directive Oct. 22, only two weeks before the Nov. 5
election, and ACLU attorneys argued that federal law prohibits such a
move so close to Election Day.</p>
<p>“It’s very clear that the secretary of state understands that this
list consists primarily or entirely of U.S. citizens who have exactly
the same fundamental core right to vote as the rest of us citizen Iowa
voters,” Rita Bettis Austen, the legal director of the ACLU of Iowa,
said during a Zoom briefing for reporters after the hearing.</p>
<p>The people on the state’s list of potential noncitizens may have
become naturalized </p>
<p>citizens after their statements to the Department of
Transportation.</p>
<p>Pate’s office told county elections officials to challenge their
ballots and have them cast provisional ballots instead. That would leave
the decision of whether they will be counted to local officials upon
further review, with voters having seven days to provide proof of their
U.S. citizenship.</p>
<p>In his ruling, Locher wrote that Pate backed away from some of his
original hardline positions at an earlier court hearing. Pate’s attorney
said the Secretary of State is no longer aiming to require local
election officials to challenge the votes of each person on his list or
force voters on the list to file provisional ballots even when they have
proven citizenship at a polling place.</p>
<p>Federal law and states already make it illegal for noncitizens to
vote, and the first question on Iowa’s voter registration form asks
whether a person is a U.S. citizen. The form also requires potential
voters to sign a statement saying they are citizens, warning them that
if they lie, they can be convicted of a felony, punishable by up to five
years in prison.</p>
<p>Locher’s ruling also came after a federal judge had halted a similar
program in Alabama challenged by civil rights groups and the U.S.
Department of Justice. Testimony from state officials in that case
showed that roughly 2,000 of the more than 3,200 voters who were made
inactive were actually legally registered citizens.</p>
<p>In Iowa’s case, noncitizens who are registered are potentially only a
tiny fraction of the state’s 2.2 million registered voters.</p>
<p>But Locher wrote that it appears to be undisputed that some portion
of the names on Pate’s list are registered voters who are not U.S.
citizens. Even if that portion is small, an injunction effectively would
force local election officials to let ineligible voters cast ballots, he
added.</p>
<p>Democrats and Republicans have been engaged in a sprawling legal
fight over this year’s election for months. Republicans have filed
dozens of lawsuits challenging various aspects of vote-casting after
being chastised repeatedly by judges in 2020 for bringing complaints
about how the election was run only after votes were tallied. Democrats
have their own team of dozens of staffers fighting GOP cases.</p>

Nageeye of Netherlands and Sheila Chepkirui of Kenya win New York City
Marathon</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — Abdi Nageeye of the Netherlands won the men’s race at the
New York City Marathon on Sunday and Sheila Chepkirui of Kenya took the
women’s event.</p>
<p>Both runners pulled away from their closest competitors in the final
few hundred meters to come away with their first victories in the
race.</p>
<p>Nageeye was step-for-step with 2022 champion Evans Chebet before
using a burst heading into Central Park to come away with the win in 2
hours, 7 minutes, 39 seconds. Chebet finished 6 seconds behind.</p>
<p>Chepkirui was running New York for the first time and pulled away
from defending champion Hellen Obiri in the women’s race. Chepkirui
started to run marathons in 2022. She finished the race in 2:24.35.
Obiri finished nearly 15 seconds behind.</p>
<p>Obiri was looking to be the first repeat champion since Mary Keitany
of Kenya won three in a row from 2014-16. Vivian Cheruiyot of Kenya
finished third, giving the African nation the top three spots.</p>
<p>Tamirat Tola, the men’s defending champion and Paris Olympic gold
medalist, finished fourth, right behind Albert Korir.</p>
<p>The top Americans finished sixth in both races. Conner Mantz led the
men and Sara Vaughn the women. Vaughn was in the lead group heading into
Mile 20 when they entered the Bronx before she dropped off the lead
pack.</p>
<p>Vaughn was geared up to run Chicago before COVID-19 kept her from
competing in that race. She was a late addition to this marathon.</p>
<p>The day got started with an upset in the men’s wheelchair race as
three-time defending champion Marcel Hug was beaten by Daniel Romanchuk,
who won in 2018 and 2019. Susannah Scaroni won the women’s wheelchair
race. It was her second victory in New York, also taking the 2022 race
and giving Americans winners in both events — the first time that has
happened.</p>
<p>The 26.2-mile course took runners through all five boroughs of New
York, starting in Staten Island and ending in Central Park. This is the
48th year the race has been in all five boroughs. Before that, the route
was completely in Central Park when it began in 1970. The first race had
only 55 finishers while more than 50,000 are expected to compete this
year.</p>
<p>The weather was perfect to run in with temperatures in the lower 40s
when the race started. Last year, it was 61 degrees when the race
started.</p>

id="will-people-leave-florida-after-devastating-hurricanes-history-suggests-not">Will
people leave Florida after devastating hurricanes? History suggests
not</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>orlando, florida — The news rippled through Treasure Island, Florida,
almost like a third storm: The mayor planned to move off the barrier
island a month after Hurricane Helene flooded tens of thousands of homes
along the Gulf Coast and two weeks after Hurricane Milton also ravaged
the state. </p>
<p>Mayor Tyler Payne’s home had been flooded and damaged beyond repair,
he explained in a message to Treasure Island residents, and he and his
husband can’t afford to rebuild. He also was stepping down as
mayor. </p>
<p>“While it pains my heart to make this decision in the midst of our
recovery from Hurricanes Helene and Milton, this is the best decision
for me and my family,” Payne, who had held the office for more than
three years and was a fourth-generation Treasure Island resident, said
Monday. </p>
<p>Up and down Florida’s storm-battered Gulf Coast, residents are making
the same calculations about whether they should stay or go. Can they
afford to rebuild? What will insurance cover? People considering moving
to Florida are contemplating whether it’s worth the risk to come to a
hurricane-prone state. </p>
<p>These existential questions about Florida’s appeal are raised
regularly after the state experiences a busy hurricane season, such as
in 2004, when four hurricanes crossed the Sunshine State. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>If moves into the state offer any answer, then hurricanes have served
little as deterrents. Florida’s population has grown by one-third to 23
million residents in the two decades since Charley, Frances, Jeanne and
Ivan ravaged the state. Last year, Florida added more than 365,000
residents, second only to Texas among states. </p>
<p>On the other hand, there are signs that Florida’s white-hot real
estate market has cooled. Sales of single-family homes were down 12% in
September compared with the same time in the previous year. But interest
rates, rising home prices and skyrocketing insurance costs likely played
bigger roles than the recent hurricanes. </p>
<p>“Florida recovers much faster than you think,” said Brad O’Connor,
chief economist for Florida Realtors. </p>
<p>What happens after a storm? </p>
<p>Studies of hurricanes along the Gulf Coast have shown that any
outbound migration tends to be short-lived, and if people do leave, it’s
usually a short-distance move, such as from a barrier island to the
mainland. Older people with more financial resources are more likely to
return to devastated communities. </p>
<p>When it comes to the housing market, there may be an initial shock to
the supply as homeowners wait for reimbursement from insurance companies
to fix up their homes or sell them. </p>
<p>But in the three years after a hurricane, home prices in areas of
Florida that were hit by one are 5% higher on average than elsewhere in
the state because of smaller supply, according to a study of the impact
of hurricanes on Florida’s housing market from 2000 to 2016. New
homeowners tend to be richer than previous ones because wealthier buyers
can absorb price increases. </p>
<p>Other factors that determine how quickly communities bounce back
include whether homes were insured, the speed of insurance
reimbursements, and whether there are enough construction workers.
Because of stricter building codes implemented in the years after
Hurricane Andrew devastated South Florida in 1992, newer homes withstand
hurricanes better than older ones, O’Connor said. </p>
<p>“If a property is damaged and uninsured, and the homeowner says, ‘I
don’t want to deal with this,’ there are always people willing to scoop
up that property because it’s valuable land,” he said. “People build new
homes under the new codes and there’s less of an impact from
hurricanes.” </p>
<p>Short term and long term </p>
<p>Recent storms offer examples what happens to communities, both short
term and longer term. </p>
<p>In Lee County, home to Fort Myers, Hurricane Ian made landfall two
years ago in what had been one of the fastest growing parts of the
United States. Population growth slowed afterward to 1.5% from 4.4%
before the storm. The number of households dropped from about 340,000 to
about 326,000, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. </p>
<p>In 2019, three-quarters of all United Van Lines truck moves were into
Lee County and a quarter were outbound, but that dropped to two-thirds
inbound and a third outbound in 2023 to 2024, the company told The
Associated Press. </p>
<p>The share of people in their late 20s, 30s and early 40s increased,
as did the share of men with no spouse or partner, reflecting an influx
of construction and recovery workers. The share of the white population
dropped while it increased for the Hispanic community. The percentage of
utility and transportation workers in the county jumped, according to
the Census Bureau. </p>
<p>Bay County in the Florida Panhandle, where Michael made landfall as
the first Category 5 hurricane on the continental U.S. in a quarter
century in 2018, offers a portrait of longer term trends. Four years
later, Bay County had recovered its pre-hurricane population, which
dropped almost 6% in the year after the storm. </p>
<p>Since Michael, the county has grown more diverse, wealthier and
older, with the median age rising from 39.6 to 41.4 and more people
identifying as multiracial or Hispanic. The share of households earning
$200,000 or more went from 4.3% before the hurricane to 8.3% in 2022 in
a sign that some of the least affluent residents couldn’t afford to
rebuild or return. </p>
<p>Treasure Island’s mayor </p>
<p>In his message to constituents, Payne said he would still stay
connected to the Treasure Island community because his parents plan to
rebuild on the barrier island, one of a string of beach towns along the

use parental rights, anti-trans messages to fight abortion ballot
measures</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CHICAGO — Billboards with the words “STOP Child Gender Surgery.”
Pamphlets warning about endangering minors. “PROTECT PARENT RIGHTS”
plastered on church bulletins.</p>
<p>As voters in nine states determine whether to enshrine abortion
rights in their state constitutions, opponents are using parental rights
and anti-transgender messages to try to undermine support for the ballot
proposals.</p>
<p>The measures do not mention gender-affirming surgeries, and legal
experts say changing existing parental notification and consent laws
regarding abortions and gender-affirming care for minors would require
court action. But anti-abortion groups hoping to end a losing streak at
the ballot box have turned to the type of language many Republican
candidates nationwide are using in their own campaigns as they seek to
rally conservative Christian voters.</p>
<p>“It’s really outlandish to suggest that this amendment relates to
things like gender reassignment surgery for minors,” said Matt Harris,
an associate professor of political science at Park University in
Parkville, Missouri, a state where abortion rights are on the
ballot.</p>
<p>Since the U.S. Supreme Court eliminated constitutional protections
for abortion, voters in seven states, including conservative Kentucky,
Montana and Ohio, have either protected abortion rights or defeated
attempts to curtail them.</p>
<p>“If you can’t win by telling the truth, you need a better argument,
even if that means capitalizing on the demonization of trans children,”
said Dr. Alex Dworak, a family medicine physician in Omaha, Nebraska,
where anti-abortion groups are using the strategy.</p>
<p>Tying abortion-rights ballot initiatives to parental rights and
gender-affirming is a strategy borrowed from playbooks used in Michigan
and Ohio, where voters nonetheless enshrined abortion rights in the
state constitutions.</p>
<p>Both states still require minors to get parental consent for
abortions, and the new amendments have not yet impacted parental
involvement or gender-affirming care laws in either state, said David
Cohen, a law professor at Drexel University.</p>
<p>“It’s just recycling the same strategies,” Cohen said.</p>
<p>In addition to Missouri and Nebraska, states where voters are
considering constitutional amendments this fall are Montana, Arizona,
Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Nevada and South Dakota.</p>
<p>Missouri’s abortion ballot measure has especially become a target.
The amendment would bar the government from infringing on a “person’s
fundamental right to reproductive freedom.”</p>
<p>Gov. Mike Parson and U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley, both Republicans, have
claimed the proposal would allow minors to get abortions and
gender-affirming surgeries without parental involvement.</p>
<p>The amendment protects reproductive health services, “including but
not limited to” a list of items such as prenatal care, childbirth, birth
control and abortion. It does not mention gender-affirming care, but
Missouri state Sen. Mary Elizabeth Coleman, a Republican and lawyer with
the conservative Thomas More Society, said it’s possible that could be
considered reproductive health services.</p>
<p>Several legal experts told The Associated Press that would require a
court ruling that is improbable.</p>
<p>“It would be a real stretch for any court to say that anything
connected with gender-affirming care counts as reproductive health
care,” said Saint Louis University law and gender studies professor
Marcia McCormick. She noted that examples listed as reproductive health
care in the Missouri amendment are all directly related to
pregnancy.</p>
<p>As for parental consent for minors’ abortions, she pointed to an
existing state law that is written similarly to one the U.S. Supreme
Court found constitutional, even before Roe v. Wade was overturned.</p>
<p>Most states have parental involvement laws, whether requiring
parental consent or notification. Even many Democratic-leaning states
with explicit protections for transgender rights require parental
involvement before an abortion or gender-affirming care for minors, said
Mary Ruth Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California,
Davis School of Law.</p>
<p>A state high court would have to overturn such laws, which is highly
unlikely from conservative majorities in many of the states with
abortion on the ballot, experts said.</p>
<p>In New York, a proposed amendment to the state constitution would
expand antidiscrimination protections to include ethnicity, national
origin, age, disability and “sex, including sexual orientation, gender
identity, gender expression, pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes, and
reproductive health care and autonomy.” The constitution already bans
discrimination based on race, color, creed or religion.</p>
<p>The measure does not mention abortion. But because it is broader, it
could be easier for opponents to attack it. But legal experts noted that
it would also not change existing state laws related to parental
involvement in minors getting abortions or gender-affirming care.</p>
<p>The New York City Bar Association released a fact sheet explaining
that the measure would not impact parental rights, “which are governed
by other developed areas of state and federal law.” Yet the Coalition to
Protect Kids-NY calls it the “Parent Replacement Act.”</p>
<p>Rick Weiland, co-founder of Dakotans for Health, the group behind
South Dakota’s proposed amendment said it uses the Roe v. Wade framework
“almost word for word.”</p>
<p>“All you have to do is look back at what was allowed under Roe, and
there were always requirements for parental involvement,” Weiland
said.</p>
<p>Caroline Woods, spokesperson for the anti-abortion group Life Defense
Fund, said the measure “means loving parents will be completely cut out
of the equation.” Weiland said those claims are part of a “constant
stream of misinformation” from opponents.</p>
<p>If this campaign strategy failed in Michigan and Ohio, why are
anti-abortion groups leaning on it for the November elections?</p>
<p>Ziegler, the University of California, Davis, law professor, said
abortion-rights opponents know they may be “playing on more favorable
terrain” in more conservative states like Missouri or in states like
Florida that have higher thresholds for passing ballot measures.</p>
<p>“Anti-abortion groups are still looking for a winning recipe,”
Ziegler said.</p>

<h2 id="americas-holiday-calendar-is-increasingly-diverse">America’s
holiday calendar is increasingly diverse</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — John Albert’s daughter didn’t go to school on Friday. And
he couldn’t be happier about it.</p>
<p>For the first time, the high school senior and all of New York City’s
public school students have the day off to mark the holiday of Diwali,
celebrated in India and among the global Indian diaspora as the victory
of light over darkness and marked by communities of Hindus, Buddhists,
Jains and Sikhs.</p>
<p>To get the holiday added to the school calendar, where it joins other
days off for Rosh Hashanah, Lunar New Year, Eid al-Fitr as well as
federal holidays like Veterans Day, Christmas and Memorial Day, took
years of pushing from those in New York’s South Asian and Indo-Caribbean
communities like Albert. But it was worth it.</p>
<p>“It was this feeling of wanting to weave our culture into New York,”
he said.</p>
<p>From religious and cultural holidays to region-specific
commemorations to days meant to honor the towering figures and moments
of U.S. history, the holiday calendars across the 50 states and the
country at large are increasingly diverse ones, a reflection of and a
window into the many communities that make up the American whole.</p>
<p>Recognizing holidays creates community</p>
<p>Including a smaller culture’s or community’s special days as
something to recognize in the larger general culture is an act of unity,
said Lauren Strauss, professor of modern Jewish history at American
University.</p>
<p>“By doing that in an American context and by including a Muslim feast
for the end of Ramadan and by including Diwali and including Rosh
Hashanah and Yom Kippur, my goodness. You’re just saying it out loud,
aren’t you? You’re saying that these cultures, these people, they aren’t
visitors, that they are a permanent part of this community, that it is
multicultural and multiethnic,” she said.</p>
<p>“Whether or not you think it’s good or bad, certainly it paints a
different picture of what it means to be American and what the American
calendar is.”</p>
<p>A look at what days are marked as holidays in places around the
country can be a crash course into what matters in those places.
Louisiana, home to New Orleans, takes a day for Mardi Gras. In Hawaii,
the state marks a day for King Kamehameha, who united the Hawaiian
islands, as well as a day for becoming a U.S. state. California and some
other states mark Cesar Chavez Day, named for the civil rights and labor
movement activist. In Texas and in the southwest, there are celebrations
scheduled for Friday marking Day of the Dead, the Mexican cultural
remembrance of loved ones who have passed.</p>
<p>The federal government, in addition to the 11 days that are days off
for federal workers, has a host of days that it marks as national
observances, like Harriet Tubman Day in March and Patriot Day on
September 11.</p>
<p>It keeps greeting card companies on their toes.</p>
<p>“Celebrating holidays and occasions, big or small, with the people we
care about is a vital thread that runs through our shared human
experience,” Kelly Ricker, chief product officer at American Greetings,
said in a statement. The company is “studying and talking to consumers,
continuously” to keep up with the kinds of cards people are looking
for.</p>
<p>When Chris Sargiotto started his greeting card company Apartment 2
Cards about 15 years ago, the holiday offerings were limited to
Christmas and Hanukkah. In recent years, he’s added Kwanzaa and Ramadan,
and is looking to bring Diwali cards onto the roster for next year.</p>
<p>The additional holidays were added because of requests from his
customers, the stores around that country that stock Apartment 2 cards,
a reflection of increasing demand.</p>
<p>“It was stores asking for it because of their customers are asking
for it,” he said. “Whenever we introduce one of these specific cards, it
seems to take off. So I think there definitely is the need for
these.”</p>
<p>There can be challenges as well</p>
<p>But a holiday is not always uncontested. Take mid-October, when the
federal government recognizes Columbus Day. It was added to the federal
calendar in the 20th century after efforts from Italian Americans, who
pushed for it as a way to stake their community’s place in America.</p>
<p>In the decades after though, Indigenous communities pushed back,
citing the impact of colonization on their people and the continuing
challenges. That has led to the spread of Indigenous People’s Day marked
on the same day, which while not a federally recognized is recognized in
states around the country.</p>
<p>And sometimes there’s some learning that needs to happen as well. In
Montville, New Jersey, the police department this month put a post on
Facebook explaining to the community that with Diwali approaching, they
would be more likely to see swastikas, a variation of which are ancient
sacred symbols in some religions and not deployed in the way Hitler and
the Nazis did.</p>
<p>With both Jewish and Hindu communities in the town, it was done in an
attempt to forestall misunderstanding, said Chief Andrew Caggiano, and
has been met with an overwhelmingly positive response.</p>
<p>“It’s a great opportunity,” he said, “to raise awareness about other
cultures that are that are in our community and that are part of our
community at this point.”</p>

id="inspired-by-harris-black-sorority-and-fraternity-members-help-downballot-races">Inspired
by Harris, Black sorority and fraternity members help downballot
races</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>HARTFORD, Conn. — U.S. Rep. Jahana Hayes isn’t a member of the
historically Black sororities and fraternities known as the “Divine
Nine.”</p>
<p>But throughout her hotly contested reelection campaign this year,
Hayes, the first Black woman to represent Connecticut in Congress, has
sometimes felt like she’s a fellow soror, the term used by Black Greek
organizations for sorority sisters. On their own, members have shown up
to call voters, organize fundraisers, knock on doors, cheer Hayes on at
campaign events and even offer pro bono legal help.</p>
<p>“I had people from Massachusetts come in to volunteer,” said Hayes, a
Democrat who is seeking a fourth term. “I’ve had people who had
previously been considering going to a battleground state like
Pennsylvania and are saying, ‘No, we’re going to stay right here and
help out in this race in Connecticut.’”</p>
<p>Downballot candidates like Hayes — particularly Black women — have
benefited from a surge in support this year from volunteers who happen
to be members of Black Greek organizations, many energized by Kamala
Harris’ presidential run. The vice president is a longtime member of
Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Inc., which was founded at her alma matter,
Howard University, in 1908. Harris pledged AKA as a senior at Howard in
1986.</p>
<p>Collectively known as the National Pan-Hellenic Council, the nine
historically Black sororities and fraternities are nonpartisan and
barred from endorsing candidates because of their not-for-profit status.
The organizations focus on voter registration drives, civic engagement
and nonelectoral initiatives and are careful not to show favor to a
particular candidate. But many of the groups’ members, as individuals,
have been “extremely active” in federal and state races around the
country this year, said Jaime R. Harrison, chairman of the Democratic
National Committee.</p>
<p>“I think that’s a part of the Kamala Harris effect,” Harrison said
during a recent visit to Connecticut.</p>
<p>There were women affiliated with all the D9 sororities on a recent
get-out-the-vote bus tour through New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,
Delaware and Maryland to support Black women on the ballot.</p>
<p>Along with other volunteers, they knocked on hundreds of doors, made
thousands of calls and sent out hundreds of postcards, urging people to
vote. The trip was organized by the Higher Heights for America PAC, a
nearly 13-year-old organization that works to elect progressive Black
women.</p>
<p>Members of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority Inc. showed off their crimson
and cream colors while stumping in Maryland for Democratic U.S. Senate
candidate Angela Alsobrooks, a fellow Delta who is in a closely watched
race against former Republican Gov. Larry Hogan.</p>
<p>Volunteers who are D9 sorority members also campaigned for Democratic
U.S. Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware, an honorary member of Alpha
Kappa Alpha who is running for the U.S. Senate. If both candidates were
elected, it would mark the first time two Black women have served in the
Senate simultaneously.</p>
<p>Latosha Johnson, a social worker from Hartford, recently participated
in a get-out-the-vote phone banking session for Hayes along with other
Black women who, like her, are members of Alpha Kappa Alpha. She said
there’s a realization among many Black and brown voters that the stakes
in the election are particularly high. And if Harris wins, she’ll need
allies in Congress, Johnson said.</p>
<p>“If we don’t get her a Congress that’s going to be able to move
things,” Johnson said, “that becomes hard.”</p>
<p>Hayes is in a rematch against former Republican George Logan, a
former state senator who identifies as Afro-Latino but has not seen an
outpouring of support from D9 members, according to his campaign.</p>
<p>Both Harris and former President Donald Trump are courting Black
voters in the final days of the presidential race. Harris’ campaign has
expressed concern about a lack of voting enthusiasm among Black men.</p>
<p>While Trump’s favorability among Black Americans has risen somewhat
since he left office in 2021, two-thirds still identify as Democrats.
About 2 in 10 identify as independents. About 1 in 10 identify as
Republicans, according to a recent poll from the AP-NORC Center for
Public Affairs Research.</p>
<p>Voter registration and nonpartisan get-out-the-vote efforts by the
sororities and fraternities, coupled with the mobilization of individual
members, could potentially have an impact on some of these races, said
Darren Davis, a professor of political science at the University of
Notre Dame.</p>
<p>“In local elections, in statewide elections, where the Black vote is
more powerful and concentrated as opposed to in national elections, D9
organizations have this tremendous untapped ability to reach and to
mobilize disaffected voters,” Davis said.</p>
<p>The D9 fraternal groups were founded on U.S. college campuses in the
early 1900s when Black students faced racial prejudice and exclusion
that prevented them from joining existing white sororities and
fraternities. In a tradition that continues today, the organizations
focused on mutual upliftment, educational and personal achievement,
civic engagement and a lifelong commitment to community service.</p>
<p>Many of the fraternities and sororities served as training grounds
for future civil rights leaders, including the Rev. Martin Luther King
Jr. and Rosa Parks.</p>
<p>Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity Inc. member Brandon McGee is a former
Democratic state representative who now leads Connecticut’s Social
Equity Council on cannabis. As the father of two daughters, he is
excited about helping Harris and Hayes win.</p>
<p>“I want my babies to see me working for a female who looks like their
mother. And even beyond looking like their mother, a female,” he said.
“And I want my babies to know, ‘You can do the same thing.’”</p>

id="ballot-box-fires-underscore-concerns-that-conspiracy-theories-make-them-targets">Ballot
box fires underscore concerns that conspiracy theories make them
targets</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>atlanta, georgia — Two ballot drop boxes in the Pacific Northwest
were damaged in a suspected arson attack just over a week before
Election Day, destroying hundreds of ballots at one location in the city
of Vancouver in the state of Washington.</p>
<p>At the other, in neighboring Portland, Oregon, it appears a fire
suppression system contained the blaze and limited the number of ballots
damaged to three. Authorities are reviewing surveillance footage as they
try to identify who is responsible.</p>
<p>Here’s what happened, how rules and security measures about drop
boxes vary across the country, and how election conspiracy theories have
undermined confidence in their use.</p>
<p>What do we know?</p>
<p>Police said incendiary devices started the fires in the drop boxes in
Portland and Vancouver. Authorities said evidence showed the fires were
connected and that they also are related to an October 8 incident when
an incendiary device was placed at a different drop box in
Vancouver.</p>
<p>Multnomah County Elections Director Tim Scott said his office was
planning to contact the three voters whose ballots were damaged in
Portland to help them get replacements ballots.</p>
<p>In Vancouver, hundreds of ballots were lost at a ballot box at the
Fisher’s Landing Transit Center when the drop box’s fire suppression
system did not work as intended. Clark County Auditor Greg Kimsey said
the box was last emptied at 11 a.m. Saturday. Voters who dropped their
ballots there afterward are being urged to contact the office to get a
new one.</p>
<p>The office will be increasing how frequently it collects ballots and
changing collection times to the evening to keep ballot boxes from
remaining full overnight when vandalism is more likely to occur.</p>
<p>Kimsey described the suspected arson as “a direct attack on
democracy.”</p>
<p>When and where can drop boxes be used?</p>
<p>Drop boxes have been used for years in states such as Colorado,
Oregon, Utah and Washington, where ballots are mailed to all registered
voters.</p>
<p>They grew in popularity in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, as
election officials sought options for voters who wanted to avoid crowded
polling places or were worried about mail delays.</p>
<p>In all, 27 states and the District of Columbia allow ballot drop
boxes, according to data collected by the National Conference of State
Legislatures. Six others don’t have a specific law but allow local
communities to use them.</p>
<p>Placement can vary widely. In some communities, they’re located
inside public buildings, available only during office hours. Elsewhere,
they are outside and accessible at any hour, typically with video
surveillance or someone watching.</p>
<p>Sporadic problems have occurred over the years.</p>
<p>In 2020, a few drop boxes were hit by vehicles, and one in
Massachusetts was damaged by arson. In that case, most of the ballots
were legible enough for voters to be identified and sent replacements. A
drop box also was set on fire in Los Angeles County in 2020.</p>
<p>How should they be secured?</p>
<p>The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency advises
state and local election officials to place drop boxes in convenient,
high-traffic areas that are familiar to voters, such as libraries and
community centers.</p>
<p>If drop boxes are not staffed, they should be secured and locked at
all times, located in well-lit areas and monitored by video surveillance
cameras, the guidance says. Many are bolted to the ground, surveilled
with cameras or confined to public buildings during business hours,
where they can be monitored.</p>
<p>How have conspiracy theories contributed to concerns around drop
boxes?</p>
<p>Ballot drop boxes have been in the spotlight for the last four years,
targeted by right-wing conspiracy theories that falsely claimed they
were responsible for massive voter fraud in 2020.</p>
<p>A debunked film called “2,000 Mules” amplified the claims, exposing
millions to a groundless theory that a ballot harvesting operation was
depositing fraudulent ballots in drop boxes in the dark of night.</p>
<p>An Associated Press survey of state election officials across the
U.S. found there were no widespread problems associated with drop boxes
in 2020.</p>
<p>Paranoia about drop boxes continued into the 2022 midterms, when
armed vigilantes began showing up to monitor them in Arizona and were
restricted by a federal judge. This year, the conservative group True
the Vote launched a website hosting citizen livestreams of drop boxes in
various states.</p>
<p>In Montana, where an important U.S. Senate race is on the ballot,
Republicans recently seized on an unsubstantiated ballot box tampering
claim to raise money off doubts about the electoral process.</p>
<p>How have states responded since the 2020 election?</p>
<p>Republican lawmakers in several states sought to tighten rules around
mail voting after the 2020 election, and much of their focus was on the
use of ballot drop boxes.</p>
<p>Six states have since banned them: Arkansas, Mississippi, Missouri,
North Carolina, South Carolina and South Dakota, according to research
by the Voting Rights Lab, which advocates for expanded voting
access.</p>
<p>Other states have restricted their use. This includes Ohio and Iowa,
which now permits only one drop box per county, according to the Brennan
Center for Justice.</p>
<p>In Georgia’s Fulton County, which includes Atlanta and has over 1
million residents, 10 ballot drop boxes are available for this year’s
presidential election. That’s down from 38 four years ago under an
emergency rule prompted by the pandemic. It’s the result of an election
overhaul by Georgia Republicans in response to former President Donald
Trump’s false claims of a stolen election.</p>
<p>Overall, 12 states prohibit drop boxes or do not list drop boxes as
an approved method of returning a ballot, according to data collected by
the National Conference of State Legislatures. Five other states do not
have a state law and do not use drop boxes.</p>
<p>Drop boxes had been used for years in Wisconsin, one of this year’s
presidential battlegrounds, but support for them has split along
ideological lines since 2020. In Wausau, the conservative mayor carted
away the city’s lone drop box, an action that’s under investigation by
the state Department of Justice. The drop box has since been returned
and is in use.</p>

id="liberty-university-sued-by-former-it-staffer-fired-after-disclosing-shes-a-transgender-woman">Liberty
University sued by former IT staffer fired after disclosing she’s a
transgender woman</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The bitter nationwide debate over transgender rights is playing out
on a very personal level in a federal court lawsuit filed in Virginia by
a former Liberty University employee. She was fired by the evangelical
Christian school after disclosing her identity as a transgender
woman.</p>
<p>The lawsuit on behalf of Ellenor Zinski was filed in July by the
American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia and the Richmond law firm of
Butler Curwood. It alleges that she was fired last year from her job on
Liberty’s Information Technology help desk solely because of her gender
identity, in violation of the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1964.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the conservative legal organization Liberty
Counsel filed a brief on behalf of the university asking the federal
district court to dismiss the lawsuit. The brief contends that the Civil
Rights Act explicitly permits religious educational institutions to make
employment decisions consistent with their religious doctrine — in this
case a doctrinal statement asserting that “denial of birth sex by
self-identification with a different gender” is sinful.</p>
<p>Liberty University, based in Lynchburg, Virginia, has evolved over
its five-decade history into one of the largest Christian universities
in the world, with more than 100,000 students enrolled in its
residential and online programs. One of its co-founders was the late
Jerry Falwell Sr., the prominent televangelist and conservative
activist; his son, Jerry Falwell Jr., served as president for 13 years
before resigning in 2020 amid a series of personal scandals.</p>
<p>The brief filed by Liberty Counsel alleges that Zinski attempted to
“set up” the university, applying for the IT job four months after
beginning to take female hormones yet agreeing — when offered the job in
February 2023 — to adhere to the school’s statement rejecting
transgender transition.</p>
<p>Only after a 90-day probation ended did Zinski notify the university
of the gender transition process and then request that the school
“depart from its doctrine and mission,” Liberty Counsel said in an
effort to get the lawsuit dismissed.</p>
<p>“All of this was done to set Liberty up and attempt to make an
example out of the university for standing its ground,” contended Mat
Staver, Liberty Counsel’s founder and chairman.</p>
<p>Wyatt Rolla, the ACLU of Virginia’s senior transgender rights
attorney, rejected the claim of a set-up.</p>
<p>“It’s strange to disparage Ellenor over what turned out to be real
concern with employment discrimination,” they said. “Her intention was
to be a highly successful employee for Liberty who continued to meet all
of her obligations.”</p>
<p>The trans woman suing Liberty had grown up admiring the
university</p>
<p>Zinski, 30, says she was raised as a conservative Christian, attended
a Christian high school, and took the job at Liberty hoping the
university — which she had admired — would accept her even after
learning of her transition. She had received a positive performance
review after completing her probation.</p>
<p>“I was really hoping they would work with me … that I could be
myself,” she told The Associated Press. “I was hoping I could advocate
for queer people. We need Jesus just as much as anyone else does.”</p>
<p>In her July 2023 letter to the university disclosing her transition,
Zinski stressed that her Christian faith “has been a guiding force
throughout this process.”</p>
<p>“The public discourse surrounding the transgender community has
imbued my journey with a certain degree of trepidation,” she wrote.
“However, I am hopeful that with your support and understanding, we can
navigate this process with sensitivity and respect for all parties
involved.”</p>
<p>Zinski received no immediate response to her letter, leading to what
she described as intense anxiety.</p>
<p>After four weeks, she inquired about the status of her case and was
promptly summoned to a meeting with Liberty human resources officials to
be informed she was being fired. A lengthy email explaining the rational
for the firing was read aloud to her at the meeting.</p>
<p>“Active and unrepentant patterns of sin, including sinful behaviors
regarding sexual expression and/or gender expression, would be
incompatible with our Christian workplace,” the email said.</p>
<p>What lies ahead for Ellenor Zinski — and her lawsuit?</p>
<p>Within a few months of her firing, Zinski was able to obtain a
similar IT help-desk job at the University of Lynchburg, a small,
private university. It is affiliated with the Christian Church
(Disciples of Christ), a mainline Protestant denomination, and describes
spiritual life on campus as “inclusive and open.”</p>
<p>“A lot of people at work have my back,” Zinski said.</p>
<p>She has also found support as an active member of Lynchburg’s Trinity
Episcopal Church. It was at Trinity, she says, that she was first
assured that “God made me this way.”</p>
<p>The next formal step in the case will be the filing of a brief by the
ACLU of Virginia opposing Liberty Counsel’s motion to dismiss the
lawsuit.</p>
<p>Daniel Schmid, a Liberty Counsel lawyer working on this case, said
there would likely be a hearing — and perhaps a decision — on the motion
to dismiss before the end of this year. Yet the case could linger far
beyond that, he said, if there are appeals eventually leading to the
U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
<p>In a phone interview with the AP, Schmid alluded to the so-called
“ministerial exception” — which gives religious institutions protection
against anti-discrimination lawsuits related to jobs with ministerial
functions.</p>
<p>Even with IT staff and janitors, Schmid said, “Liberty considers them
to be ministers of the Gospel. The First Amendment protects their right
to make that call.”</p>
<p>The lawsuit seeks compensatory and punitive damages of $300,000 on
behalf of Zinski, as well as a declaration that the university’s
handling of the case violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.</p>
<p>Zinski told the AP she has no desire to return to work at Liberty, at
least under its current leadership.</p>
<p>“My biggest fear if I ever went back is knowing there are people who
do not want me there at all,” she said. “I would not feel comfortable
enough to work there.”</p>

id="latino-evangelical-voters-torn-between-their-faith-and-harsh-rhetoric-around-immigration">Latino
evangelical voters torn between their faith and harsh rhetoric around
immigration</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The Rev. Arturo Laguna leads a largely immigrant church of about 100
followers in Phoenix. His job as a pastor, he says, gets complicated
come election season.</p>
<p>Laguna’s church, Casa de Adoracion, is in Arizona — one of seven
closely watched swing states that could possibly decide the next
president. It is also a microcosm of the larger Latino evangelical
Christian community in the U.S.</p>
<p>The soft-spoken Laguna says, for the members of his congregation,
voting is “not an intellectual issue.”</p>
<p>“It’s a matter of faith and spirituality,” he said. “We’re in a
complicated moment because, on the one hand, we are against abortion,
and on the other, we are concerned about the sharp rhetoric around
immigration and lack of reform. It’s a difficult choice.”</p>
<p>This is not a new dilemma for Latino evangelicals, who are growing in
numbers even as mainline white Protestant denominations have steadily
declined. Latino evangelicals are an influential voting bloc. Both
parties have tried to appeal to them over the past two election cycles —
neither with remarkable success — according to faith and community
leaders.</p>
<p>A 2022 Pew Research Center survey showed 15% of Latinos in the U.S
identify as evangelical Protestants. Among all American evangelicals,
they are the fastest-growing group. About half of Latino evangelicals
identified as Republicans or as independents who lean right, while 44%
identified as Democrats or as independents leaning left.</p>
<p>While U.S. Latinos generally favor Democratic candidates, a majority
of Latino evangelicals backed Donald Trump in 2020. According to AP
Votecast, about six in 10 Latino evangelical voters supported Trump in
2020, while four in 10 supported Biden.</p>
<p>A Pew survey released last month showed that about two-thirds of
Latino Protestants planned to back Trump this year, while about
two-thirds of Hispanic Catholics and religiously unaffiliated Hispanics
said they were supporting Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>
<p>Agustin Quiles, president and founder of Mission Talk, a
Florida-based Latino Christian social justice organization, says
conflicting priorities leave some Latino evangelicals feeling
politically homeless. Some are torn between their conservative views on
social issues such as abortion and their desire to see immigration and
criminal justice reform, he said.</p>
<p>While many are offended by Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric, Quiles
added, Democrats still haven’t figured out how to have conversations
with the community about issues such as abortion.</p>
<p>“So there is a lot of silence among Latino evangelicals right now,”
he said. “That does not mean they are not going to vote. There is just a
lot of discontent.”</p>
<p>To understand Latino evangelicals, it is important to understand
their origins, said Elizabeth Conde-Frazier, a scholar of the
Association of Hispanic Theological Association. The word “evangelico”
pertains to Protestants or those who are not Catholic, which includes a
wide swath of churches, cultures and traditions, she said.</p>
<p>“When immigrants come here and have to reestablish themselves, the
Protestant, Pentecostal and mainline churches become spaces where people
create a new sense of community and family,” Conde-Frazier said. “People
are trying to understand what life is supposed to be in this
country.”</p>
<p>With white Protestantism in decline and different mainline
denominations vying for the loyalty of these communities,
second-generation Latino Christians became more a part of the dominant
culture and often embraced the fervor of the white evangelical church,
she said.</p>
<p>“Latino churches, in order to gain a sense of power and acceptance,
began to align with (white conservative) evangelical churches in the
U.S., moving away from their ‘evangelico’ roots,” Conde-Frazier said.
Now, she added, some Latino evangelicals find themselves increasingly at
odds with their white counterparts because they are pro-immigration.</p>
<p>Quiles says in white evangelical churches where Latinos, including
undocumented immigrants, are growing in numbers, there is palpable
dissonance between what is said in the pulpit and how those in the pews
perceive it.</p>
<p>“Just because a pastor pushes anti-immigrant agenda, that does not
mean members are receiving it,” he said. “They selectively take what
they want from the teaching.”</p>
<p>The Rev. Juan Garcia, who leads a 100-strong Hispanic ministry at the
First Baptist Church in Newport News, Virginia, said the word
“evangelico” represents the Gospel to him. He says the “evangelical”
label feels tainted because of its affiliation with one political
party.</p>
<p>“Jesus is not Democrat or Republican,” he said. “Some see their
Christian values being represented by the Republican party and others
see some of their values represented by the Democrats. But neither party
is Christian in essence.”</p>
<p>Garcia feels that sense of political homelessness, too.</p>
<p>“I have a candidate I may vote for, but no political party I’d like
to belong to,” he said. “The most important value we as Christians must
live by is love — love our neighbors, the poor, those fleeing
persecution.”</p>
<p>Garcia said he has his “opinions and inclinations” but doesn’t view
the candidate he favors as flawless. He warns his flock: “If one is the
anti-Christ, the other is not Christ.”</p>
<p>The Rev. Jacqueline Tavarez, pastor of the Pentecostal Church of God
in Raleigh, North Carolina, says her diverse congregation cares more
about the values a political party represents rather than the face or
the voice of the party.</p>
<p>“Our community doesn’t care about the politics,” she said. “They care
about laws that affect our communities in terms of jobs, opportunities,
education. And they view abortion and transgender laws as an attack on
family values. When they see the ballot, they don’t see Trump or
(Harris). They see what the party supports and how the community is
going to fare under a candidate.”</p>
<p>The Rev. Lori Tapia, the Arizona-based national pastor and president
of the Obra Hispana, Disciples of Christ, said politics is not typically
integrated into the life of the Latino evangelical church. Unlike white
evangelical congregations, political engagement happens more
organically, she said.</p>
<p>“Here, the compassion piece is always stronger and there is a desire
to see leaders who will prioritize compassionate politics,” Tapia said.
“There is also frustration at how slow progress is on critical issues.
Anyone can pitch a story or a political campaign. But where is it being
manifested in the lives of people who are struggling?”</p>
<p>Bishop Angel Marcial, who leads the Church of God that oversees more
than 15,000 churches, says some of the main issues for his congregants
are healthcare education, public safety and housing.</p>
<p>“Voting gives you respect in this country and it brings opportunities
for marginalized communities,” he said. “As pastors, we don’t tell
people whom to vote for, but we do tell them about the platforms that
best align with the values of the church and needs of our
communities.”</p>
<p>John P. Tuman, professor of political science at the University of
Nevada, Las Vegas, observes that in Las Vegas, Latino evangelicals who
join larger evangelical churches that have English and Spanish services
tend to skew conservative. However, in communities that form their own
congregations and conduct services in Spanish and Otomi, an Indigenous
language in Mexico, are likely to have more diverse political views.</p>
<p>“They tend to be historically in favor of immigration reform with a
pathway to citizenship, along with other elements of a social justice
message that resonates more with Democratic candidates,” he said.</p>
<p>Nevada is also a key swing state.</p>
<p>Pastor Willie Pagan, who leads the 700-strong Iglesia de Dios in
North Las Vegas that falls under the Church of God, said the economy is
a top issue for his congregants.</p>
<p>“Yes, people are worried about immigration, but those who are here
already, they want the economy to be stable,” he said. “They see
homelessness and crime growing in Las Vegas. Our church was in a rough
neighborhood that has gotten rougher recently.”</p>
<p>Pagan says some in his congregation believe they were better off
financially and safer during the Trump administration, and wish to vote
Republican to uphold their conservative religious values. But there are
also those who fear they or their loved ones could get deported, he
said.</p>
<p>“The struggle is real.”</p>

id="indian-americans-show-shifting-political-loyalties-ahead-of-presidential-election">Indian
Americans show shifting political loyalties ahead of presidential
election</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — At a recent Diwali gathering in Denver, software
architect Salil Gaonkar asked his Indian American friends to raise their
hands: Would they vote for Trump or Harris in the presidential race?</p>
<p>The response — from about 45 tech professionals and business owners
who had overwhelmingly backed Joe Biden in 2020 — stunned him. Former
President Donald Trump edged out Vice President Kamala Harris, albeit by
a narrow margin.</p>
<p>“I was shocked,” Gaonkar, a progressive Democrat who is supporting
Harris, said. “Most of them voted for Biden, but now there was a
significant shift and that surprised me really.”</p>
<p>One dinner poll does not a trend make, but Gaonkar’s experience
appears to reflect a broader national pattern. Indian Americans, long a
reliable Democratic voting bloc, are showing signs of shifting
allegiance.</p>
<p>A Carnegie Endowment survey released this week showed the number of
Indian Americans identifying as Democrats dropped to 47% from 56% in
2020. Harris, despite her Indian heritage, commanded just 60% support
from a community that gave Biden nearly 70% of its votes four years ago.
Trump, meanwhile, improved his support to 31% from 22%.</p>
<p>The survey has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.7%. And while
other polls show stronger South Asian support for Harris, the shift in
loyalties is significant, said Milan Vaishnav, director of Carnegie
Endowment’s South Asia program and one of the co-authors of the
study.</p>
<p>“We are seeing some signs of a greater shift or movement or
acceptance of at least this Republican Party, led by Trump, and that to
us, was a big surprise,” Vaishnav said in an interview with VOA last
Friday.</p>
<p>The rightward drift isn’t unique to Indian Americans. In recent
years, Republicans have made surprising gains among Hispanic, Black,
Arab and Muslim voters – all once deemed reliable Democratic voting
blocs.</p>
<p>Polls show a razor-thin race between Harris and Trump, and whether
these shifts will propel the former president back to the White House
remains uncertain. But the findings shatter a core assumption of
American politics: that minority and immigrant communities are safely
Democratic, Vaishnav said, during an online presentation Thursday.</p>
<p>“There has been this idea of demography is destiny and that the
Democratic Party, which has been the natural home to ethnic and racial
minorities and many if not most immigrant communities … will have a
perpetual electoral advantage as the size of these groups increases,” he
said. “Clearly, there are many signs that that’s not true. Our survey is
one of them.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>More than 5 million strong, Indian Americans defy easy
categorization. They’re predominantly Hindus, with smaller numbers of
Muslims, Sikhs, Christians and others among them. While many
first-generation Indians lean conservative, plenty don’t.</p>
<p>Ahead of the Tuesday’s election, their concerns mirror those of other
Americans: Inflation, abortion, jobs, and immigration. U.S.-India
relations barely register.</p>
<p>“They vote like Americans because they are,” said Sumitra
Badrinathan, a professor at the American University and one of three
co-authors of the report, during the presentation.</p>
<p>Demolishing long-held assumptions about the community, the Carnegie
survey revealed that Harris’ Indian heritage hasn’t helped her top
Biden’s 2020 numbers. More surprisingly, it showed that Indian American
men under 40 — not their first-generation, supposedly “traditional”
elders — are driving the rightward shift.</p>
<p>“The Democrats don’t have a problem with the uncles,” Vaishnav said.
“They have a problem with males under 40.”</p>
<p>According to Pew Research, about two-thirds of Indian Americans are
immigrants. Many are politically split by era.</p>
<p>“People who came in 1990 or later are clinging to Trump, but people
[in] my dad’s generation are solidly Democratic,” said Angana Shah, a
Michigan-based social justice lobbyist and lawyer.</p>
<p>The divide between first- and second-generation Indians surfaces in
other ways. For many recent arrivals, illegal immigration has emerged as
a top concern. Gaonkar said his formerly Biden-supporting friends cite
illegal border crossings as the main reason for switching to Trump.</p>
<p>“Indians hate the illegal immigration that skyrocketed under Biden,”
Gaonkar said. “We know what hoops we have had to go through to get into
the country legally and stay here and to see some others come in like
that is not right.”</p>
<p>The sentiment cuts deep among first-generation immigrants. Take
Dharmendra Jaiswal, a Maryland tech executive whose path to citizenship
stretched nearly 20 years.</p>
<p>He voted for Biden in 2020, his first presidential election, but now
backs Trump.</p>
<p>“People are pissed off,” he said. “Illegal immigrants are getting
[education and health care] from our taxpayer money.”</p>
<p>Indians make up the third-largest group of undocumented immigrants in
the U.S. But Jaiswal said, “illegal immigrant is illegal immigrant.”</p>
<p>Suhag Shukla, co-founder of the Hindu American Foundation, said the
backlash against illegal immigration makes sense. Immigration backlogs
force many Indian immigrants to wait 10 to 20 years for green cards and
citizenship.</p>
<p>“People should not be in limbo for 20 years, but unfortunately that
is the state of the immigration program that we are dealing with today
and many are speaking out just like many other Americans about the need
to have stronger borders,” Shukla said in an interview with VOA this
week.</p>
<p>Criticized for being soft on unauthorized immigration, Harris has
defended her record, highlighting a drop in illegal border crossings due
to recent policy changes implemented by the Biden administration. For
his part, Trump has vowed to carry out the “largest deportation
operation in American history.”</p>
<p>Harris’ campaign, launched in July, electrified many progressive
Indian Americans, drawing thousands of eager volunteers.</p>
<p>But the enthusiasm masked a deeper reality: Her Indian heritage
proved a weak draw for many voters. The Carnegie survey found that fewer
than 1 in 10 Indian American supporters were motivated by her South
Asian heritage.</p>
<p>Towson University professor Pallavi Guha, an Indian American, said
many members of her community are “looking beyond identity
politics.”</p>
<p>“People who are supporting Vice President Harris are supporting Vice
President Harris because of the policies,” Guha, who lives in Howard
County, Maryland, said in an interview with VOA on Thursday.</p>
<p>A survey of South Asian voters by the Indian American Impact Fund, a
political group, found Harris leading Trump, 68% to 20%, in the
battleground states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina and
Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>With more than 400,000 eligible South Asian voters in these states,
the community is “poised to make the margin of difference in what will
likely be a razor-thin election,” the group said in a statement last
month.</p>
<p>But the enthusiasm isn’t uniform. Rupal Shah, an Atlanta-based
second-generation Indian American non-profit worker volunteering for
IAI, sees a generational divide.</p>
<p>“I’m second generation and I believe that my generation of folks are
very, very pro-Kamala, ready to vote for her, excited about her,” Shah
said. “And then when you talk to my parents or parents in general, you
get a sense of excitement and a sense of nervousness.”</p>
<p>“Their fiscal concerns always kind of rise to the top, but there’s
also a lot of excitement about Kamala and who she represents and how she
represents our community,” Shah said.</p>
<p>VOA reached out to both the Trump and Harris campaigns for comment
but did not receive a response from either group.</p>

lithium mine will crush rare plant habitat US said is critical to its
survival, lawsuit says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>RENO, Nevada — Conservationists and a Native American tribe are suing
the U.S. to try to block a Nevada lithium mine they say will drive an
endangered desert wildflower to extinction, disrupt groundwater flows
and threaten cultural resources.</p>
<p>The Center for Biological Diversity promised the court battle a week
ago when the U.S. Interior Department approved Ioneer Ltd.’s Rhyolite
Ridge lithium-boron mine at the only place Tiehm’s buckwheat is known to
exist in the world, near the California line halfway between Reno and
Las Vegas.</p>
<p>It is the latest in a series of legal fights over projects President
Joe Biden’s administration is pushing under his clean energy agenda
intended to cut reliance on fossil fuels, in part by increasing the
production of lithium to make electric vehicle batteries and solar
panels.</p>
<p>The new lawsuit says the Interior Department’s approval of the mine
marks a dramatic about-face by U.S. wildlife experts who warned nearly
two years ago that Tiehm’s buckwheat was “in danger of extinction now”
when they listed it as an endangered species in December 2022.</p>
<p>“One cannot save the planet from climate change while simultaneously
destroying biodiversity,” said Fermina Stevens, director of the Western
Shoshone Defense Project, which joined the center in the lawsuit filed
Thursday in federal court in Reno.</p>
<p>“The use of minerals, whether for EVs or solar panels, does not
justify this disregard for Indigenous cultural areas and keystone
environmental laws,” said John Hadder, director of the Great Basin
Resource Watch, another co-plaintiff.</p>
<p>Rita Henderson, spokesperson for Interior’s Bureau of Land Management
in Reno, said Friday the agency had no immediate comment.</p>
<p>Ioneer Vice President Chad Yeftich said the Australia-based mining
company intends to intervene on behalf of the U.S. and “vigorously
defend” approval of the project, “which was based on its careful and
thorough permitting process.”</p>
<p>“We are confident that the BLM will prevail,” Yeftich said. He added
that he doesn’t expect the lawsuit will postpone plans to begin
construction next year.</p>
<p>The lawsuit says the mine will harm sites sacred to the Western
Shoshone people. That includes Cave Spring, a natural spring less than
1.6 kilometers away described as “a site of intergenerational
transmission of cultural and spiritual knowledge.”</p>
<p>But it centers on alleged violations of the Endangered Species Act.
It details the Fish and Wildlife Service’s departure from the dire
picture it painted earlier of threats to the 15-centimeter-tall
wildflower with cream or yellow blooms bordering the open-pit mine
Ioneer plans to dig. </p>
<p>The mine’s permit anticipates up to one-fifth of the nearly 3.6
square kilometers the agency designated as critical habitat surrounding
the plants — home to various pollinators important to their survival —
would be lost for decades, some permanently.</p>
<p>When proposing protection of the 368 hectares of critical habitat,
the service said “this unit is essential to the conservation and
recovery of Tiehm’s buckwheat.” The agency formalized the designation
when it listed the plant in December 2022, dismissing the alternative of
less-stringent threatened status.</p>
<p>“We find that a threatened species status is not appropriate because
the threats are severe and imminent, and Tiehm’s buckwheat is in danger
of extinction now, as opposed to likely to become endangered in the
future,” the agency concluded.</p>
<p>The lawsuit also discloses for the first time that the plant’s
population, numbering fewer than 30,000 in the government’s latest
estimates, has suffered additional losses since August that were not
considered in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s biological
opinion.</p>
<p>The damage is similar to what the bureau concluded was caused by
rodents eating the plants in a 2020 incident that reduced the population
as much as 60%, the lawsuit says.</p>
<p>The Fish and Wildlife Service said in its August biological opinion
that while the project “will result in the long-term disturbance
(approximately 23 years) of 146 acres (59 hectares) of the plant
community … and the permanent loss of 45 acres (18 hectares), we do not
expect the adverse effects to appreciably diminish the value of critical
habitat as a whole.”</p>

separated by US-Mexico border reunite for a few precious minutes</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico — Nearly 200 families gathered Saturday along a
stretch of the U.S.-Mexico border for heartfelt but brief reunions with
loved ones they had not seen for years because they live in different
countries. </p>
<p>Tears flowed and people embraced as Mexican families were allowed to
reunite for a few minutes at the border with relatives who migrated to
the U.S. Adults and children passed over the Rio Grande to meet with
their loved ones. </p>
<p>This year, the annual “Hugs Not Walls” event organized by an
immigrant rights advocacy group happened three days before the U.S.
presidential election, whose monthslong campaigns have focused heavily
on immigration and border security. It also took place under decreased
security, according to the Network in Defense of the Rights of
Migrants. </p>
<p>“We did not have barbed wire, we did not have so many soldiers
deployed in our community,” said Fernando Garcia, the organization’s
director, highlighting the border security changes that the border has
seen since the reunions began last decade. “The barbed wire had to be
opened so that the families could have this event.” </p>
<p>Garcia said he expects migration into the U.S. to continue regardless
of who wins Tuesday’s election. Family reunions, he said, will continue,
too. </p>
<p>“Deportation policy, border policy, immigration policy, is separating
families in an extraordinary way and is deeply impacting these
families,” he said.</p>

<p>US border arrests remained lower in October amid Biden asylum
restrictions</p>
<p>U.S. border authorities apprehended about 54,000 migrants illegally
crossing the U.S.-Mexico border in October, according to preliminary
figures obtained by Reuters. They show a marginal rise from September
but continue the broader downward trend since June when new restrictions
were imposed under President Joe Biden. Vice President Kamala Harris,
the Democratic presidential candidate, has called for even tougher
border restrictions in the face of criticism by Republican candidate
Donald Trump over illegal immigration. Reuters reports.</p>
<p>Migrant families separated under Trump still feel fallout, fear his
return</p>
<p>With the United States on the verge of an election that could put
former President Donald Trump back in office, Billy wants people to know
that what happened to him and several thousand other children still
reverberates. Some families have not been reunited, and many of those
together in the U.S. have temporary status and fear a victorious Trump
carrying out promised mass deportations. The Associated Press
reports.</p>

<p>Canada-India tensions could escalate cyberthreats, hinder
immigration</p>
<p>Canada’s deepening dispute with India over its alleged campaign of
violence against Sikhs in Canada could intensify Indian-based cyber
espionage and hold back immigration, but analysts and experts see no
immediate impact on trade. Concern about a widening rift between the two
countries comes after a senior Canadian official told a parliamentary
national security committee Tuesday that Indian Minister of Home Affairs
Amit Shah, a close ally of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, was the
mastermind behind the alleged plots. Reported by Reuters.</p>
<p>Sudan displacement crisis worsens as fighting, hunger, sexual
violence escalates</p>
<p>The International Organization for Migration warned Tuesday that
Sudan’s displacement crisis is worsening as increasing numbers of people
flee fighting, hunger and sexual violence, thereby threatening “regional
instability.” “The scale of this displacement and the corresponding
humanitarian needs grows every day,” Amy Pope, IOM director general,
told journalists in Geneva on a video link from Port Sudan. Lisa Schlein
reports for VOA from Geneva.</p>
<p>Uganda struggles to feed 1.7 million refugees as international
support dwindles</p>
