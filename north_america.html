</li>
</ul>
<p>Brown University students were told that all remaining classes and exams for the semester would be delayed after the shooting that killed two people and left several others injured.</p>
<p>In a note to students, the university’s provost, <strong>Francis J Doyle III</strong>, said the decision was made “out of our profound concern for all students, faculty and staff on our campus”. He encouraged students and staff to focus on their safety and wellbeing.</p>
<p>In the immediate aftermath of these devastating events, we recognize that learning and assessment are significantly hindered in the short term and that many students and others will wish to depart campus. Students are free to leave if they are able. Students who remain will have access to on-campus services and support.</p>
<p>At this time, it is essential that we focus our efforts on providing care and support to the members of our community as we grapple with the sorrow, fear and anxiety that is impacting all of us right now. University leaders are committed to providing care and mobilizing resources to assist our community members through this difficult time.</p>

      <p>End of subsidies after failed legislation will have serious and damaging impact on entire sector, policy experts say</p>
<p>With subsidies for Affordable Care Act (ACA) health insurance set to expire, Americans who rely on them will probably switch to plans with lower monthly premiums and high deductibles or decide not to purchase any coverage, which will have a serious and damaging impact on the entire sector, according to healthcare policy experts.</p>
<p>The average amount ACA plan enrollees pay annually for premiums is estimated to more than double, from an average of <span class="math inline">\(888 this year to \)</span>1,904 in 2026, according to a <a href="https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/aca-marketplace-premium-payments-would-more-than-double-on-average-next-year-if-enhanced-premium-tax-credits-expire/">KFF analysis</a>.</p>

<p>Founded by Jimmy Glenn, a former boxer turned trainer, in 1971, Jimmy’s Corner has stood, defiantly unchanged, as Times Square has boomed around it.</p>
<p>The neighborhood bar, a New York City institution which attracts locals and tourists alike, has had the same pictures on the walls for decades – some of the bar’s regulars have been coming almost as long – kept the same furniture, and maintained remarkably low pricing. In a perhaps unintentional nod to its history, there is also several years’ accumulation of dust in some areas.</p>

</ul>
<p>Two people have been killed and several more critically injured in a shooting at Brown University, in Providence, Rhode Island. Here’s what we know so far:</p>
<p><strong>A shooter dressed in black <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/13/brown-university-shooting">killed at least two people and wounded nine others at Brown University</a> during final exams</strong> on the Ivy League campus.</p>
<p><strong>On Sunday morning, police said a person of interest was in custody.</strong> Providence police chief Col Oscar Perez said the person was in their 30s but declined to say where the arrest was made and whether the person was connected to the university.</p>
<p><strong>Brown University president Christina Paxson confirmed that the two people killed were students</strong>. Providence Mayor Brett Smiley said a shelter-in-place was in effect for the area and encouraged people living near the campus to stay inside and not to return home until it was lifted. The shelter in place order was lifted on Sunday morning.</p>
<p><strong>Eight people with gunshot wounds were taken to Rhode Island hospital</strong>, where seven were in critical but stable condition, Brown University president Christina Paxson said on Sunday. One person remains in a critical condition, she added. One student was discharged from hospital on Saturday night and left with their parents.</p>
<p><strong>Police released footage of the man they suspected to be behind the shooting late on Saturday</strong>, adding that some witnesses reported that the man, who could be in his 30s, may have been wearing a camouflage mask. The shooting happened inside a classroom.</p>
<p><strong>Law enforcement officers were seen at a hotel a short drive away from Brown University on Sunday morning.</strong> An FBI agent told the Associated Press that the person of interest was detained at a Hampton Inn hotel in Coventry, about 20 miles (32 km) from Providence. Officers remained on the scene there, with police tape blocking off a hallway.</p>
<p><strong>University officials initially told students and staff that a suspect was in custody, before later saying that was not the case and that police were still searching for a suspect or suspects</strong>. The mayor said a person preliminarily thought to be involved was detained but was later determined to have no involvement.</p>

      <p>As LA’s mayor touted a developer’s model home, residents of Altadena and Pacific Palisades wrangle for insurance payouts</p>
<p>Nearly a year after a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california-wildfires">mammoth wildfire</a> tore through Pacific Palisades, leveling 7,000 structures and leaving many displaced, some residents watched as the mayor of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/los-angeles">Los Angeles</a> hailed a “major milestone” in the effort to recover.</p>
<p>A new home had been built, the first since the firestorms that killed at least 12 people in the Pacific Palisades and 19 people in Altadena, and the Los Angeles department of building and safety had issued a certificate saying it had passed inspection and was ready for people to move in.</p>

      <h1>‘It’s not a coincidence’: journalists of color on being laid off amid Trump’s anti-DEI push</h1>

(date: 2025-12-14)
      <p>
      <p>Black and brown former employees from CBS, NBC and Teen Vogue talk about the effects of being let go</p>
<p>Trey Sherman was traveling to work on the New York subway when he received an email from <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/11/07/bari-weiss-cbs-news-remake/">David Reiter</a>, a CBS News executive, about an imminent meeting on 29 October. Sherman, an associate producer of CBS Evening News Plus at the time, suspected that he would be laid off. CBS News’s parent company, Paramount, had closed a merger with the Hollywood studio Skydance in August, and planned to slash <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/29/business/media/paramount-layoffs-skydance.html">more than 2,000 jobs</a> as part of corporate restructuring.</p>
<p>Sherman, who is Black, and Reiter, who is white, had an amicable conversation, according to Sherman. Reiter told Sherman that he was being laid off because his show was being eliminated, Sherman said, and that Reiter was unable to assign the team to other positions. Sherman accepted the news and the two men wished each other good luck.</p>

      <p>Analysts say benefits could be felt in under-resourced rural hospitals but warn against AI as a cost-cutting measure</p>
<p>For states to receive certain funding stipulated in the Trump administration’s “big, beautiful” bill, they must meet three of 10 criteria – including integrating more artificial intelligence ( <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/artificialintelligenceai">AI</a>) technology in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/healthcare">healthcare</a> settings – which experts say could have major benefits and liabilities for under-resourced hospitals, depending on how it’s implemented.</p>
<p>The Rural Health Transformation Fund is a carveout that will provide $50bn over a period of five years to states <a href="https://www.cms.gov/priorities/rural-health-transformation-rht-program/overview">who meet certain application criteria</a>, including “consumer-facing, technology-driven solutions for the prevention and management of chronic diseases,” and “providing training and technical assistance for the development and adoption of technology-enabled solutions that improve care delivery in rural hospitals, including remote monitoring, robotics, artificial intelligence, and other advanced technologies”.</p>

At 36, when she was pregnant with her second child, she was diagnosed with a rare genetic mutation called familial partial lipodystrophy.

<p>A Native American tribe in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/kansas">Kansas</a> is facing criticism from other tribal groups after its economic development subsidiary secured a $29.9m federal contract from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to design potential <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ice-us-immigration-and-customs-enforcement">Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)</a> detention facilities.</p>
<p>The development entity of <a href="https://www.pbpindiantribe.com/">the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation</a> signed the contract to design the detention facilities in October, leading to criticism that the tribal group, which was uprooted from the Great Lakes region to reservation lands north of Topeka, Kansas, in the 1830s, was itself benefiting from forced removals under the Trump administration.</p>

<p>Just as record-level flood waters that triggered widespread evacuations begin to recede in western <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/washington-state">Washington state</a>, residents of the Pacific north-west are bracing themselves for another strong weather system that is likely to swell rivers back to dangerous levels – again.</p>

As a result of the nonstop rain, mudslides tore through communities, washing away homes and stranding families on rooftops as they waited for rescue.</p>

<p>New Nasa satellite images reveal the scope of central California’s dreary December, caused by an enormous fog formation that has been haunting the Central Valley for weeks, trapping residents in colder-than-usual temperatures.</p>
<p>The low cloud formation, known as tule fog, first formed over central California in November and persisted into early December. The Central Valley typically sees this type of fog during the colder months of the year, when the air near the ground is cold and moist, and the winds are calmer, allowing moisture in the air to transform into a thick layer of fog.</p>

      <h1>‘Not a gift-giving year’: student loan debt upends US borrowers’ holiday spending</h1>

(date: 2025-12-13)
      <p>
      <p>After Trump ended key repayment plan, 40% of borrowers say their student loans make it harder to cover essentials</p>
<p>A recent <a href="https://ticas.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DFP-Topline-Polling-Results_12.3.25.pdf">survey</a> found that a whopping 40% of student loan borrowers say that their loans have negatively affected their ability to cover their basic needs, such as food, housing and transportation – a financial burden that becomes even more apparent around the holiday season.</p>
<p>At first glance, someone like Ben L should not be struggling financially. He attended Georgetown University and Columbia University for his undergraduate and graduate degrees, respectively, and now earns a six-figure salary working at a biotech company. Still, the 36-year-old is drowning in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/student-debt-us">student debt</a>.</p>

<p>The Minnesota Wild made an all-in move for one of the NHL’s best players in his prime, acquiring defenseman Quinn Hughes from the Vancouver Canucks in a blockbuster trade – their boldest action yet toward ending a decade-long skid of playoff series defeats.</p>
<p>The teams announced the seismic move on Friday night, after the 2024 Norris Trophy winner as the league’s top defenseman had been the most talked-about trade candidate over the past couple of weeks. Minnesota sent center Marco Rossi, defenseman Zeev Buium, winger Liam Ohgren and a first-round pick in the 2026 draft to suddenly rebuilding Vancouver to complete the deal.</p>

<p>Less than 24 hours after rewriting the World Cup age record, Vonn briefly looked on course for another victory as she surged ahead of Italy’s Sofia Goggia on the sunlit Corviglia course. But Aicher, skiing immediately after her, attacked the increasingly rutted track and edged Vonn by 0.24 seconds to deny her a rare opening-weekend double.</p>

<p>Instead, when Hegseth and his wife, Jennifer Rauchet, appeared on the Katie Miller Podcast, the titular host asked questions like: “If you could write one Hegseth family rule on that whiteboard, what is that?”</p>

<p>Exulting in Biden’s drowsiness, the US president and his supporters seemed blissfully ignorant of a rich irony: that 79-year-old Trump himself has recently been spotted apparently dozing off at various meetings.</p>

(date: 2025-12-13)
      <p>
      <p>By using music from SZA, Sabrina Carpenter and Olivia Rodrigo in ICE videos, the government is playing a game of rage-bait</p>
<p>Last week, as the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> was engulfed in controversy over its illegal military strikes near Venezuela (among numerous other crises), a Department of Homeland Security employee – I picture the worst sniveling, self-satisfied, hateful loser – got to work on the official X account. The state-employed memelord posted a video depicting Immigration Customs and Enforcement (ICE) officials arresting people in what appeared to be Chicago, celebrating the humiliation and incarceration of undocumented immigrants as some sort of patriotic achievement. The vile video borrowed, as they often do, from mainstream pop culture; in this case, a viral lyric from Sabrina Carpenter’s song Juno – “Have you ever tried this one?”, referring to sex positions – overlaid on clips of agents chasing, tackling and handcuffing people, cheekily nodding to all the methods in ICE’s terror toolbox.</p>
<p>Carpenter, as a pre-eminent pop star, was caught in an impossible position. Say nothing, as her friend and collaborator Taylor Swift did weeks earlier when the White House used her music in a Trump hype video, and risk <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/nov/15/taylor-swift-silence-trump-administration-speaks-volumes">appearing as if you condone</a> the administration’s use of your art for a domestic terror campaign (the administration hasn’t yet used Swift for an ICE video, but I’m sure it’s coming); or engage, even if to honestly express your utter disgust, and risk bringing more attention to objectionable propaganda designed to provoke a response.</p>

<p>Lionel Messi's tour of India kicked off chaotically on Saturday as fans threw objects, ripped up seats and invaded the pitch at Kolkata's Salt Lake Stadium after the Argentine soccer great made only a brief appearance at a ticketed event.</p>

      <h1>Trump loomed over baseball’s Hall of Fame. But voters still said no to Bonds and Clemens</h1>

(date: 2025-12-13)
      <p>
      <p>With Trump championing Pete Rose and pressuring MLB’s commissioner, the Hall of Fame vote became a referendum on power, memory and whether integrity still matters</p>
<p>Since mid-May, when Major League Baseball commissioner Rob Manfred announced Pete Rose <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/may/15/pete-rose-hall-of-fame-baseball">would be eligible for Hall of Fame consideration</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jun/05/mlb-commissioner-manfred-admits-he-paid-attention-to-trump-when-overturning-pete-rose-ban">explained his specious reasonings behind it</a>, last week’s Hall of Fame vote by the 16-member Classic Era committee carried with it a certain air of inevitability for Roger Clemens and Barry Bonds, the two greatest players currently not enshrined in Cooperstown.</p>
<p>Rose was championed by Donald Trump, who used his populism to demand the Hit King finally be allowed into the Hall, an honor denied Rose since 1989 when baseball placed him on the permanently ineligible list for betting on games when he managed the Cincinnati Reds. After Rose <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/sep/30/pete-rose-dies-mlb-baseball">died in September 2024</a>, Trump then won the presidency five weeks later and immediately increased the pressure on Manfred to end Rose’s 36-year banishment – despite the absence of any evidence suggesting Rose was any less guilty in death of gambling on the sport than he had been alive. Nevertheless, Manfred acquiesced to Trump, and in 2027, for the first time, Pete Rose will be eligible for induction into the Hall of Fame.</p>

<p>Democrats on the House judiciary committee on Friday will ask Aileen Cannon, the judge who presided over the case against Donald Trump for allegedly hiding classified documents, to release the portion of special counsel Jack Smith’s report concerning his prosecution.</p>
<p>Smith is scheduled to appear next week for a behind-closed-door deposition with the Republican-led committee, where he may discuss his investigation into allegations that Trump took classified materials to his properties and then hid them from federal authorities. The special counsel dropped that case against Trump, as well as another concerning his meddling in the 2020 election, in the aftermath of his re-election victory last year.</p>

      <h1>Hunger’s whip: why connecting US food stamps to work is outdated and ineffective</h1>

(date: 2025-12-12)
      <p>
      <p>In many parts of the country, there are new work requirements to get food aid. But starving people doesn’t motivate them – despite centuries of this rhetoric</p>
<p>For more than 200 years, common wisdom and policymakers have assumed that to get people to work, you had to make them hungry. New work requirements for Snap food benefits, which went into effect in most of the US on 1 December, are only the latest in a long line of policies based on this idea. The new rules cut off benefits for any non-disabled adult up to age 65 who cannot prove that they are working or seeking work at least 80 hours every month (that includes homeless people, veterans and former foster youth). The Congressional Budget Office estimates that <a href="https://civileats.com/2025/11/03/food-insecurity-predicted-to-rise-as-new-snap-work-requirements-take-effect/">2.7 million people will lose their benefits</a>.</p>
<p>You’ve heard this reasoning before: people are motivated to work because they and their families have to survive. If you give someone welfare – especially food aid – they become dependent and lazy. The Florida-based Foundation for Government Accountability, a conservative thinktank that has been campaigning for years to cut welfare, calls this “ <a href="https://thefga.org/research/universal-work-requirements/">the dependency trap</a>”. Starving people by taking away their food stamps is supposed to “incentivize individuals to better themselves and transition from dependency to work and self-reliance”.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Defeat complicates the picture for Republicans across the US as they seek to redraw districts in an increasingly messy battle</p>
<p>The Indiana legislature’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/11/indiana-republicans-redistricting">rejection</a> of a new map that would have added two Republican seats in Congress marked one of the biggest political defeats for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> so far in his second term and significantly damaged the Republican effort to reconfigure congressional districts ahead of next year’s midterm elections.</p>
<p>The defeat showed that Trump’s political might is not unlimited. For months, the president waged an aggressive effort to twist the arms of Indiana lawmakers into supporting a new congressional map, sending JD Vance to meet in person with lawmakers. Trump allies also set up outside groups to pressure state lawmakers.</p>

<p>For six months, she managed the Journey Service Center, a “psilocybin service center” where adults 21 and older take supervised mushroom trips. She watched elderly clients with terminal illnesses able to enjoy life again. She saw one individual with obsessive compulsive disorder so severe they spent hours washing their hands who could casually eat food that fell on the floor.</p>

      <h1>‘There’s power in numbers’: New Yorkers are banding together to protect street vendors from ICE</h1>

(date: 2025-12-12)
      <p>
      <p>With ICE targeting vendors and fear rising, community groups are organising fast to keep New Yorkers working on the streets safe</p>
<p>On a December day when temperatures dipped below 20 degrees, Street Vendor Project staff walked along a busy commercial street in the Bronx, handing out “know your rights” information to vendors selling fruits and vegetables. Several vendors mentioned they were scared after watching videos of immigration raids across the city.</p>
<p>“We used to go around helping vendors apply for permits so they wouldn’t get fined,” said Eric Nava-Pérez, Street Vendor Project’s Spanish-speaking member organizer. “But now, we’re out here distributing immigration rights information.”</p>

      <p>It’s the most wonderful time of the year — and with that, the obligatory office holiday party. Thing is, some choices around holiday parties can tell a story of how a company is doing. Who's there? Who's chatting together or sticking to a corner? What food and drink are being served? Today, we'll help you read the room. But first, most regional Federal Reserve bank presidents have been reappointed, despite some Trump administration proposals to exert greater control over the Fed's regional banks.</p>

      <p>Lawyers say people ‘don’t feel safe to leave their home’ as officials target recent arrivals and those awaiting hearings</p>
<p>Immigration agents appear to be increasingly arresting and detaining Afghan asylum seekers, especially men, who have arrived in the US recently and are awaiting court hearings to decide their cases.</p>
<p>Amir – an asylum seeker who came to the US via Mexico in 2024 – was driving home from his English class in Bloomington, Indiana just after noon on Monday, when he was pulled over by an unmarked police vehicle. Minutes later, the asylum seeker from Afghanistan was cuffed and driven to a detention center.</p>

      <h1>First Thing: Indiana Republicans reject effort to redraw voting maps in rebuke to Trump</h1>

      <p>
      <p>Measure to add two GOP-friendly seats failed 19-31 after 21 Republicans joined 10 Democrats. Plus, how the Paris climate treaty changed the world</p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>Indiana Republicans <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/11/indiana-republicans-redistricting">rejected an effort to redraw the state’s lines</a> on Thursday in a rebuke to Donald Trump and Republican efforts to add two more Republican-friendly seats to Indiana’s congressional districts.</p>
<p><strong>How might the administration react to the vote?</strong> Heritage Action, the advocacy branch of the conservative Heritage Foundation, posted on social media: “President Trump has made it clear to Indiana leaders: if the Indiana senate fails to pass the map, all federal funding will be stripped from the state. Roads will not be paved. Guard bases will close. Major projects will stop. These are the stakes and every NO vote will be to blame.”</p>
<p><strong>What are Democrats doing on redistricting?</strong> They’ve retaliated to the initial push by Texas to add five more likely Republican seats by redrawing maps in California.</p>
<p><strong>Has there been pushback to Trump’s escalation?</strong> Yes – after the US seized a tanker named the Skipper off the coast of Venezuela, some US lawmakers expressed concern that Trump was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/11/lawmakers-venezuela-oil-tanker">“sleepwalking us into a war with Venezuela”.</a></p>

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Reddit has filed a lawsuit calling for Australia's social media ban for children under 16 to be declared invalid. The text-based forum is one of 10 online platforms covered by the ban, which came into force this week. And later in the program, we head to Peru, where conflicts are brewing over how money from Machu Picchu tickets is being spent and whether it's benefiting tourists and locals.</p>

      <h1>Trinity Rodman: why US soccer could lose its most compelling star to Europe</h1>

(date: 2025-12-12)
      <p>
      <p>The forward’s blocked contract and a growing talent drain to Europe have nudged the NWSL into crisis mode. Here’s what’s happening and why it matters</p>
<p>The Trinity Rodman contract saga has exposed a fundamental tension at the heart of the National Women’s Soccer League: a salary-cap model built for stability and measured growth coming in collision with a global market that has accelerated far beyond it.</p>
<p>Rodman is one of the most important young players in US soccer, arguably its most marketable female star and a centerpiece of the NWSL’s future. Yet European giants have offered her salaries that America’s top women’s domestic league cannot legally match, prompting the NWSL <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-04/trinity-rodman-s-multimillion-dollar-contract-rejected-by-nwsl">to veto a record-breaking Washington Spirit deal</a> (and the players’ union <a href="https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/Articles/2025/12/05/nwslpa-files-grievance-for-trinity-rodman-due-to-leagues-veto-of-spirit-contract-extension/">to file a grievance</a> in response).</p>

      <h1>NFL playoff race: Patriots and Bills battle in AFC East as Rivers runs it back</h1>

(date: 2025-12-12)
      <p>
      <p>The AFC East rivals face off in a game that could decide their conference’s top seed, while a familiar face may return for the Colts</p>
<p>There is some serious debate that could run over this week’s top-shelf matchup. The Rams, the NFC’s current No 1 seeds, are welcoming the Lions, who claimed top seed in the conference last season. The Denver Broncos, the AFC leaders, host the Green Bay Packers who still have a shot at a first-round bye in the NFC. Either way you go you won’t be disappointed. Only there is a third way: Buffalo v New England. The emphasis is on the bounty that winning brings rather than the perils of defeat on Sunday. The Patriots can wrestle back the AFC’s No 1 seed while Buffalo can give themselves a shot at snatching the AFC East title from New England. Oh, and two MVP candidates in Drake Maye and Josh Allen are running the show. It could be a classic.</p>

<p>In a book about LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers, it’s only fitting that one memorable scene involves a Hollywood star: Will Smith.</p>

<p>More than 50 members of Congress are demanding answers from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and homeland security officials after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/03/us-veterans-affairs-database-immigration">the Guardian revealed</a> the VA is compiling a report on all non-US citizens “employed by or affiliated with” the government agency that will then be shared with other federal agencies, including immigration authorities.</p>
<p>The lawmakers, led by Illinois congresswoman Delia Ramirez – along with congressman Mark Takano of California and US senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, the top Democrats on the House and Senate veterans affairs committees – have written a group letter to be sent to the VA secretary, Doug Collins, and the secretary of homeland security, Kristi Noem, on Friday.</p>

<p>Every U.S. president releases a national security strategy document about a year into their term, but few have made as big a splash as Donald Trump's, earlier this month.
The document formally spells out much of what we've come to expect from Trump's approach to foreign policy in his second term: political relationships are transactional, and American interests take priority above all else. The document also takes particular aim at Europe, and pledges explicit support for right-wing movements abroad.
Bob Rae was, until recently, Canada's ambassador to the UN, following decades of political office including premier of Ontario. He reads between the document's lines and explains what it means for Canada — and asks how much of it is actually worth taking seriously.</p>

The treasury department <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sb0332">alleged</a> the vessels “engaged in deceptive and unsafe shipping practices and continue to provide financial resources that fuel Maduro’s corrupt narco-terrorist regime”.</p>

<p><strong>Chris Van Hollen</strong>, the Democratic senator from Maryland, was among the lawmakers speaking out against <strong>the Trump administration</strong> and its actions around <strong>Venezuela</strong>, taking to the senate floor on Wednesday to call on Congress to block Donald Trump from “using taxpayer dollars to launch a <strong>regime change war</strong>” <strong>.</strong></p>
<p>“Last time I checked, the <strong>constitution</strong> of the United States gives <strong>Congress</strong> – this body – the power to decide questions of war or peace,” he said.</p>

<p>The US’s sharpening ideological polarization is affecting a wider and much more junior cross-section of the country’s armed forces and challenging the military’s ability to remain above the political fray, a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff has said.</p>
<p>Retired Adm Mike Mullen, who was the US’s top military commander under presidents George W Bush and Barack Obama, called the political environment facing currently serving officers “challenging” and “the most dangerous time” in his memory.</p>

Rainfall from the storm could reach 5-10cm (2-4 inches) across lower elevations and 25cm higher up in the Cascades, alongside 45mph gusts of wind</p>

<p>If you want to know what kind of winter to expect across much of Canada this winter, you’re out of luck — Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) is predicting above-seasonal temperatures in the eastern Arctic region, but elsewhere, the forecast is pretty up in the air. That’s partly because of climate change and La Niña, experts say.</p>

Those include inflation and Trump's tariffs that are making fertilizer and farm equipment more expensive, and the President's trade war with China which closed a huge market for American soybean exports.</p>

<p>There is growing, at least somewhat bipartisan unease in Washington over the administration’s escalating military posture in the region. Trump has accused Venezuela of facilitating drug trafficking, and increased the US military presence in the Caribbean to a level not seen in decades. The administration has also conducted a campaign of bombings of alleged drug boats, killing more than 80 people so far.</p>

      <p>Some warn proposal will decimate US tourism industry as free speech advocates say it will lead to people self-censoring</p>
<p>Free speech advocates have accused Donald Trump of “shredding civil liberties” and “censorship pure and simple” after the White House said it planned to require visa applicants from dozens of countries to provide social media, phone and email histories for vetting before being allowed into the US.</p>
<p>In a move that some commentators compared to China and others warned would decimate tourism to the US, including the 2026 Fifa World Cup, the Department for Homeland Security said it was planning to apply the rules to visitors from 42 countries, including the UK, Ireland, Australia, France, Germany and Japan, if they want to enter the US on the commonly used Esta visa waiver.</p>

      <h1>ICE raids harken back to COVID-era hardship</h1>

(date: 2025-12-11)
      <p>
      <p>The COVID-19 pandemic changed the economic circumstances of many, creating demand for direct aid, interrupting consumer spending, and altering the nature of work. Today, there are people across the country in lockdown again — mixed-status immigrant families, who are experiencing disruptive economic pressures that mirror the pandemic. Today, we'll draw parallels. Plus, more people admit to stealing at self-checkouts. And, what can we expect from the Federal Reserve in 2026?</p>

      <h1>Can a nepo baby be an underdog? The remarkable rise of Shedeur Sanders</h1>

(date: 2025-12-11)
      <p>
      <p>The quarterback was seen as living off his father’s name when he entered the NFL. But he has slowly started to prove himself at the Cleveland Browns</p>
<p>It seems the goalposts are always moving on Shedeur Sanders, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cleveland-browns">Cleveland Browns</a>’ rookie quarterback who keeps throwing people off.</p>
<p>He excelled at <em>two</em> colleges to establish himself as a top NFL prospect, only to wind up getting picked in the fifth round of this year’s NFL draft in one of the most <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/apr/25/shedeur-sanderss-first-round-nfl-draft">dramatic stock crashes</a> in league history. He then distinguished himself in training camp, only to wind up as the back-up to the back-up. When Sanders was finally pressed into injury relief duty last month and led the Browns to just their third win of the season, the caveat was that his breakthrough had come at the expense of the even-worse Las Vegas Raiders. Last week against the struggling Tennessee Titans, Sanders became the first Browns quarterback to throw for more than 300 yards and three touchdowns and rush for another score in the same game since 1950. But for many, the bigger headline was that he lost. Again.</p>

<p>US forces have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/10/us-forces-reportedly-seize-oil-tanker-off-venezuela-coast">seized an oil tanker</a> off the coast of Venezuela, in a major escalation of Donald Trump’s four-month pressure campaign against the South American country’s dictator, Nicolás Maduro, whose government called the seizure “an act of international piracy”.</p>
<p><strong>Where is Venezuela’s opposition leader,</strong> <strong>María Corina Machado</strong> <strong>, in all this?</strong> The Nobel peace prize winner <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/11/maria-corina-machado-venezuela-nobel-peace-prize-winner-oslo-norway">greeted crowds in Oslo</a> after secretly traveling to Norway following 11 months in hiding in Caracas. She said she backs the US oil tanker seizure, calling it a crucial step to tackle what she says is Maduro’s criminal regime.</p>

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Mexico’s parliament has voted in favor of a bill imposing tariffs of between 5% and 50% on more than 1,400 products from Asian nations, including China. Mexico states that the aim is to boost jobs and domestic production. Then, survivors of a deadly typhoon in the Philippines have filed a legal claim in Britain against the oil and gas giant Shell. And later, we'll hear about the lucrative business of making drones and developing the technology to thwart them.</p>

<p>Lionel Messi is a MLS Cup winner. That might rank lowly on the GOAT’s list of career achievements, but it was clear in the Argentine’s celebrations after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/dec/06/inter-miami-vancouver-mls-cup-final-messi-de-paul">the 3-1 win over the Vancouver Whitecaps</a> in Saturday’s championship game just how much this meant.

      <p>The AI boom is propelling a once-obscure group of state regulators into key decision-making roles for the economy. AI needs data centers, data centers need power and power is generally regulated in some way — depending on the state — by public utilities commissions.</p>
<p>That's the topic of a new report from the Center on Technology Policy at NYU. Scott Brennen, CTP director and author of the report, said these commissions often make decisions on planning and permitting for new infrastructure and decide the rates utilities charge consumers.</p>

      <p>Legislation includes pay increase for troops and a demand for more information about boat strikes in the Caribbean</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/house-of-representatives">US House</a> voted 312-112 to pass a sweeping defense policy bill on Wednesday that authorizes $900bn in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-military">military</a> programs, including a pay raise for troops and an overhaul of how the Department of Defense purchases weapons.</p>
<p>The 3,000-page bill also includes a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/military-strikes-boats-drugs-caribbean-hegseth-congress-93c513e28f38688f5582150c7675c072">demand</a> for more information about nearly two dozen lethal <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/24/visual-guide-us-military-presence-caribbean">boat strikes</a> in the Caribbean targeting suspected drug smugglers.

      <h1>US House passes bill to bolster Europe’s defence, in apparent rebuke to Trump’s foreign policy strategy</h1>

(date: 2025-12-11)
      <p>
      <p>The 2026 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) carries $8bn more than the funding Trump requested in May</p>
<p>The US House has approved a sweeping defence bill that bolsters Europe’s security, in what appears to be sharp rebuke to Donald Trump’s mounting threats to downgrade Washington’s ties to traditional allies and Nato.</p>
<p>The bipartisan vote came just days after the publication of a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/05/civilisational-erasure-us-strategy-document-appears-to-echo-far-right-conspiracy-theories-about-europe">White House national security strategy</a> that said Europe faced “civilisational erasure” and made explicit Washington’s support for Europe’s nationalist far-right parties – rattling EU leaders and opening up a seismic shift in transatlantic relations.</p>

(date: 2025-12-10)
      <p>
      <p>The Federal Reserve cut its key interest rate Wednesday by a quarter point. That’s pretty much what analysts expected. But in other parts of the world, central banks have been signaling that they plan to hold rates steady or even hike them. In this global economy, why is the U.S. out of step? Also in this episode, we hear the pros and cons of quarterly earnings reports, check in on a union-run pipefitting apprenticeship and dig into why wage growth has slowed.</p>

<p>Donald Trump may not have won a Nobel peace prize, but last weekend he was at least given something: the inaugural <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/dec/05/fifa-peace-prize-trump-world-cup-infantino">Fifa peace prize</a>.</p>
<p>TheFifa prize’s existence was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/dec/05/fifa-peace-prize-trump-world-cup-infantino">announced</a> remarkably soon after the Nobel went to Venezuelan opposition leader, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/maria-corina-machado">María Corina Machado</a>. Gianni Infantino, the controversial Fifa president, has been toadying to Trump for years, so after he introduced the prize – in response to zero demand – it was little surprise that Trump got the trophy.</p>

      <p>Divisive vote to lower rates highlights uncertainty in the Fed as economy absorbs major shakeups, including tariffs</p>
<p>The US Federal Reserve announced on Wednesday that it was cutting interest rates by a quarter point for the third time this year, as the embattled central bank appeared split over how best to manage the US economy.</p>
<p>The Fed chair, Jerome Powell, has emphasized unity within the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the board of Fed leaders that sets interest rates. But the nine-to-three vote to lower rates to a range of 3.5% to 3.75%was divisive among the committee that tends to vote in unanimity.</p>

      <h1>Keir’s performance in PMQs panto sets bar low enough for Kemi to stay as Tory leader | John Crace</h1>

(date: 2025-12-10)
      <p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Lib Dems’ Gentleman Ed rips into Starmer for staying silent on The Donald’s US security strategy</p>
<p>With little more than a week to go until the Christmas recess, the Commons is in festive overdrive. Demob happy. A few minutes in to the year’s penultimate prime minister’s questions with MPs from both sides shouting and cheering, the speaker interrupted proceedings to say: “We don’t need the panto auditions any more.” To which the natural response was: “Ooh yes we do.” Because that’s pretty much the whole purpose of PMQs at the best of times. A feelgood experience for some. A feelbad experience for others. Noise with no substance.</p>
<p>No one embraces the panto spirit more than Kemi Badenoch. Kemi has come to realise that the bar is actually quite low for her to remain as Tory leader. All she has to do is be a little bit better than Keir Starmer at PMQs. Which is turning out to be a lot less difficult than she imagined. Sometimes just standing up is enough.</p>

<p>Philadelphia Eagles coach Nick Sirianni moved quickly on Wednesday to shut down the rising speculation around Jalen Hurts’ job security, calling talk of a potential quarterback change “ridiculous” despite his team’s three-game losing streak and their franchise star’s sudden dip in form.</p>
<p>Hurts committed five turnovers – four interceptions and a lost fumble – in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/09/eagles-chargers-monday-night-football-nfl">Monday night’s 22-19 defeat</a> to the Los Angeles Chargers, punctuating one of the ugliest outings of his career. The final mistake, an interception near the goalline in overtime, sealed another deflating loss for an Eagles side that has averaged just 16 points across the past five games. The 8-5 Eagles have not won since 10 November.</p>

<p>Shares in German automotive and arms manufacturer <strong>Rheinmetall</strong> are down 3.3%, UK weapons maker <strong>BAE</strong> <strong>System</strong> has dropped by 1.27%, and Italian defence firm Leonardo has lost 2.2%.</p>
<p>Mainland European equity markets are heading lower in a day that will be dominated by monetary policy out of the Americas.</p>
<p>Notably, the defence sector has particularly suffered this morning, with the likes of BAE Systems, Rheinmetall, and Thales lose traction as the end of the Russia-Ukraine war comes into sight. Unfortunately for Europe, the peace agreement appears to be a deal Trump has formed with Russia behind the back of European leaders whom the President has labelled “weak”.</p>

<p>In reality, the result is more of a seismic shifting of sands given the magnitude of her victory over the Donald Trump-backed Republican candidate, Emilio González, in the most populous city in Miami-Dade county, which the president won in 2024 by 12%.</p>

      <p>Dynamic pricing is here. Several consumer groups designed a shopping experiment with hundreds of volunteers who shopped on Instacart for the same products at the same time from the same stores. The conclusion? 75% of products were offered at different prices to different customers. Plus, we'll chat about what's next for interest rates today and on into the new year.

<p>Almost half of EU citizens regard Donald Trump <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/04/europeans-trump-enemy-of-europe-russia-war-poll">as an enemy of Europe</a>, a new survey across nine countries revealed last week. The poll, conducted for the French debate platform Le Grand Continent, found that across Europe, Trumpism is considered “a hostile force”.</p>
<p>The new US foreign policy doctrine published by the White House on Friday will have heightened these respondents’ worst fears. The 30-page National Security Strategy landed like a bombshell in Europe. And citizens may have been out in front of their political leaders in figuring out what Trump’s worldview could mean for Europeans.</p>

      <h1>Amazon announces mega investment in India</h1>

(date: 2025-12-10)
      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Amazon has announced plans to double its investment in India by 2030 — to the tune of around $35 billion — with a focus on artificial intelligence and e-commerce. It comes after Microsoft and Google also laid out multibillion-dollar spending plans for AI in India. Also, the U.K.'s Royal Navy is developing ways to counter an increasingly serious threat from Russia to cut its critical undersea infrastructure.</p>

<p>US regulatory officials are re-examining the safety of RSV shots despite no published reports of safety issues – a move that could lead to the removal or limitation of shots that have dramatically lowered hospitalizations among babies.</p>
<p>It’s the latest move from US health officials under Robert F Kennedy Jr, the secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and a longtime anti-vaccine activist, to limit access to shots and to undermine public trust in the safe and effective products.</p>

      <p>Zines have made a resurgence as communities seek to share information on everything from ICE raids to local elections</p>
<p>On a cloudy Saturday afternoon, the Los Angeles central public library bustled with nearly 100 people making zines, small, DIY magazines made out of a single piece of paper. There was folding, laughing and helping with cuts. Titles like “Narcan 101,” “Free Palestine,” and “An American Zine,” filled with illustrations and tips, lined a table down the hall.</p>
<p>While this may sound like a scene from the 1980s or 1990s – when zines were popular as a countercultural form of expression – this was a workshop in modern-day Los Angeles, where immigration raids and federal threats have left residents restless and scared.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Ukraine’s president to look at holding wartime vote. Plus, the hidden life of Matthew Perry</p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said he is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/09/zelenskyy-ready-for-elections-after-trump-questions-ukrainian-democracy">ready to hold a wartime election within the next three months</a>, if Ukraine’s parliament and foreign allies will allow it, after Donald Trump accused him of clinging on to power.</p>
<p><strong>Why hasn’t there been an election?</strong> Zelenskyy’s five-year term expired in May last year, but the Ukrainian constitution prohibits elections during wartime, and even his political opponents have said repeatedly that the security and political considerations do not allow for holding a vote while the war continued.</p>
<p><strong>What else did he talk about?</strong> There were familiar rally staples such as a mocking impression of Joe Biden, as well as a repeat of a racist falsehood about the Democratic congresswoman Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, a Muslim woman born in Somalia: “We ought to get her the hell out! She married her brother … Therefore she’s here illegally.” The crowd chanted: “Send her back!” Omar has called the claims about her brother “ridiculous”.</p>

<p>Kamala Harris lost last year’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/06/donald-trump-wins-us-presidential-election">US presidential election</a> because she chased the wrong voters with the wrong message, ultimately demobilising the very base that she needed to win, according to an autopsy by a progressive grassroots advocacy group.</p>
<p>The vice-president focused on courting moderate Republicans over motivating core Democratic working-class, young and progressive voters, a misstep compounded by her failure to break from Joe Biden on Gaza, says the report by <a href="https://rootsaction.org/">RootsAction</a>.</p>

      <h1>‘A different type of game’: USMNT veterans on how to handle World Cup pressure</h1>

(date: 2025-12-10)
      <p>
      <p>In 2010 and 2022, the US faced heightened emotions from the lead-in to the tournament itself. As hosts next year, little will change</p>
<p>The draw is done. The schedule is set. For the US men’s national team, all that’s left, aside from playing the games, are the emotional highs and lows. After the draw, US head coach Mauricio Pochettino referenced a “competitive stress” factor triggered by the World Cup. He said the friendlies against Belgium and Portugal in March are intended to simulate that stress so that it doesn’t surprise his players when the spotlight of the World Cup arrives.</p>
<p>With the margins always thin at a World Cup, earning results that mitigate that pressure could prove to be the difference between the USMNT crashing out just when they capture the undivided attention of the nation, or enduring and soaring to a best-ever finish.</p>

<p>The “premium” that the UK pays to borrow money compared with its international peers may be coming to an end as markets grow more confident about the government’s plans, a thinktank has suggested.</p>
<p>The Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) said that the chancellor Rachel Reeves’s announcement in the autumn budget that she would be more than doubling the UK’s financial headroom by 2030 from £9.9bn to £22bn had begun to assure bond markets about Labour’s fiscal approach.</p>

      <p>Rare-earth elements help power our everyday electrical devices, and that’s because most batteries are made with minerals like lithium, nickel, cobalt and graphite. As of now, China has the largest reserve of these minerals. But some mining companies are eyeing the deep sea’s floor, says Marketplace contributor Dan Ackerman, because such rare earths form organically way down there. Plus, the ethical concerns that come with this deep-sea mining.</p>

<p>A Bronx man has been charged with attempted murder in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/nov/16/kris-boyd-new-york-jets-shot-nfl">the shooting of New York Jets player Kris Boyd</a>, police announced Tuesday.</p>
<p>The New York police department said Frederick Green, 20, was charged late Monday night. Police had revealed Monday that a “person of interest” was in custody but didn’t name them. It was not immediately clear if Green has an attorney. He also faces additional charges of assault and criminal possession of a weapon, police said.</p>
<p>Boyd was shot in the abdomen just after 2am on 16 November in midtown Manhattan. Boyd, his friend and two other Jets’ players, Irvin Charles and Jamien Sherwood, had left a club and were approached by a group of men who made fun of their clothing, police told reporters at a news briefing.</p>

<li>
<p>Crews-Dezurn moving up to heavyweight for bout</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Claressa Shields will defend her undisputed heavyweight championship in Detroit on 22 February, returning home for a rematch with Franchon Crews-Dezurn in her first fight since signing a landmark $8m promotional deal. The bout will headline a Dazn card at Little Caesars Arena, the home of the NBA’s Pistons and NHL’s Red Wings where Shields attracted <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jul/27/claressa-shields-fight-heavyweight-title-detroit">a near-sellout crowd for her most recent fight</a> last July.</p>
<p>Shields (17-0, 3 KO) and Crews-Dezurn (10-2, 2 KO) first met nearly a decade ago when they <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/19/claressa-shields-boxing-olympics-professional-debut-kovalev-ward">made their professional debuts against each other</a> on the undercard of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/20/andre-ward-sergey-kovalev-boxing-points-decision-title-fight">Andre Ward’s victory over Sergey Kovalev</a> in 2016. Shields won a four-round unanimous decision that night in Las Vegas, a moment she still sees as formative. “I had just come off winning two Olympic gold medals, fresh out of the amateurs, and finding an opponent was tough,” she said in a press release announcing the fight. “Franchon stepped in. I’ve grown a lot since that first victory, but me and Franchon have unfinished business that needs to be settled.”</p>

      <p>President did same thing his administration is now calling ‘mortgage fraud’ in case against Fed governor Lisa Cook</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> signed mortgage documents in the 1990s claiming two separate Florida properties would each serve as his principal residence – the same thing his administration is calling “mortgage fraud” when done by political rivals, records show.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-mortgage-fraud-florida-principal-residences">ProPublica</a> unearthed documents demonstrating that within seven weeks of each other in late 1993 and early 1994, the president obtained loans for neighboring Palm Beach homes, pledging each would be his primary dwelling. Instead of living in them, though, he rented both out as investment properties.</p>

<p>More than 200 former employees in the justice department’s civil rights division <a href="https://www.thejusticeconnection.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Civil-Rights-Division-Sign-On-Letter.pdf">signed a letter</a> released on Tuesday decrying the “near destruction” of the agency that is supposed to enforce US civil rights laws and accused political leadership of waging a campaign to purge career experts from its ranks.</p>
<p>There was a mass exodus of lawyers earlier this year after political appointees removed career managers, detailed employees to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/01/civil-rights-division-doj-trump">menial work,</a> unilaterally dropped cases, and made it clear the division’s focus would be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/18/justice-department-civil-rights-division-trump">enforcing</a> Donald Trump’s priorities. By 1 May of this year, the department had lost about 70% of its attorneys – a staggering number. The letter was released on Tuesday to commemorate the 68th anniversary of the founding of the civil rights division.</p>

<p>Inter Miami star scored 29 goals with 19 assists</p>

<li>
<p>Messi won MLS Cup MVP in South Florida on Saturday</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After a season in which he led Inter Miami to the club’s first MLS Cup, Lionel Messi has been named the Landon Donovan MLS Most Valuable Player for the 2025 season. League commissioner Don Garber made the announcement on Tuesday, capping a season in which Messi scored 29 goals with 19 assists in 28 appearances, one short of Carlos Vela’s record for goal contributions in a single season (though Vela’s was done in 31 games).</p>
<p>Messi joins Kansas City Wizards legend Preki as the only players to win the MVP award twice, with Messi being the first to win two such awards consecutively. At 38, Messi is not the oldest MVP in MLS history – that distinction also goes to Preki, who was the oldest MVP in the history of North American professional sports when he won the award at age 40 in 2003.</p>

(date: 2025-12-09)

      <p>Three proposed casinos approved as researchers say they take money from businesses and increase addiction</p>
<p>New York City will probably soon see three new casinos, whose owners could rake in profits because of a recent surge in gambling in the United States that has some campaigners worried.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york">New York</a> gaming facility location board last week approved three proposed casinos in the US’s largest city – two in Queens and one in the Bronx – after determining the businesses would create new jobs and generate billions in tax revenue, according to the <a href="https://nycasinos.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2025/12/12.01.25.gflbselectiondocument.pdf">group’s report</a>.</p>
<p>This article was amended on 9 December 2025 to correct that the New York gaming facility location board approved the casinos last week, not this week as previously stated.</p>

</ul>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>A coalition of global civil society organizations has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/09/us-civic-health-rating-trump">downgraded the civic health rating of the US</a> from “narrowed” to “obstructed”.</p>
<p><strong>What</strong> <strong>does it mean by “obstructed”?</strong> Countries where civic space is heavily contested – where civil society organizations still exist but state authorities undermine them, including through illegal surveillance, bureaucratic harassment and demeaning public statements.</p>
<p><strong>What’s holding up</strong> <strong>the European plan?</strong> Though a majority of EU countries support the plan, it has met strong resistance from Belgium. About £160bn ($213bn) of Russian assets are immobilised at Euroclear, a central securities depository in Brussels, and the Belgian government is concerned that it will bear liability for any seizure and face retaliation from Moscow.</p>

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> A new law comes into force in Australia today, banning children under 16 from some of their favorite social media platforms, including Snapchat, TikTok, and Instagram. And as you'd expect, most teens aren’t happy about it, though many parents see it as the government standing up to American Big Tech. Also, Nvidia is now authorized to sell advanced AI chips to China, and President Donald Trump says the U.S. government will be taking a 25% cut of sales.</p>

      <h1>3D printing was supposed to disrupt prosthetic costs. It hasn’t.</h1>

(date: 2025-12-09)
      <p>
      <p>Prosthetic limbs can be expensive, costing thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars. So the industry seemed ripe for disruption when 3D printing came along. The technology requires little labor and uses economical materials. But the reality of 3D printing prosthetic limbs isn’t that straightforward, according to writer and University of California, Berkeley, lecturer Britt Young, who uses a prosthetic arm.</p>
<p>Marketplace’s Meghan McCarty Carino spoke with Young about why 3D printing has yet to bring down prosthesis costs.</p>

The group cited a “sharp deterioration of fundamental freedoms in the country … following a year of sweeping executive actions, restrictive laws and aggressive crackdowns on free speech and dissent.”</p>

<p>Twelve former FBI agents fired after kneeling during a 2020 racial justice protest in Washington have sued to get their jobs back, saying their action had been intended to de-escalate a volatile situation and was not meant as a political gesture.</p>
<p>The agents say in their lawsuit that they were fired in September by Kash Patel, the FBI director, because they were perceived as not being politically affiliated with Donald Trump. But they say their decision to take a knee on 4 June 2020, days after the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police, has been misinterpreted as political expression.</p>

      <p>President says farmers are ‘the backbone of our country’ and says China has committed to buying $40bn in American soybeans</p>
<p><a href="http://mpdc.dc.gov/release/statement-chief-police-pamela-smith">In a statement</a>, <strong>Pamela Smith</strong> said she was “deeply humbled, grateful and deeply appreciative” of her time in her role, which she described as the “greatest honor” of her career. She gave thanks to the mayor for appointing her in 2023 and supporting her throughout her tenure, which she acknowledged had been both “challenging and rewarding”.</p>
<p>Smith adds that “tremendous progress” has been made but the city is not at “zero percent crime” yet.</p>
<p><em>I am confident that the department is in a strong position and that the great work will continue, moving in a positive trajectory to combat crime and enhance public safety. Washington, DC is an extraordinary place to live, visit, and work, and I remain inspired by the resilience and spirit of this community.</em></p>
<p><em>I am profoundly grateful for the opportunity to serve in this capacity as Chief of Police. It has been an honor to lead the men and women of the Metropolitan Police Department, and I will always carry with the me the pride of having served this city.</em></p>
<p><em>When Chief Smith stepped up to lead the Metropolitan Police Department, we had no time to waste. She came in at a very challenging time for our community, when there was significant urgency to reverse the crime trends our city was facing post pandemic. Within a year of her tenure, we opened the Real-Time Crime Center.</em></p>
<p><em>We deployed newer and better technology. We worked with the Council to pass comprehensive legislation that prioritizes accountability. And Chief Smith got all of this done while also navigating unprecedented challenges and attacks on our city’s autonomy.</em></p>

<p>Democratic representative Jasmine Crockett launched a bid for US Senate in Texas on Monday, bringing a high-profile official to a race that may be critical to Democrats’ bold ambition to reclaim a Senate majority in next year’s midterm elections.</p>

The two-term representative of Dallas is seeking to flip the seat held by Republican John Cornyn, who is running for re-election in the GOP-dominated state.</p>

      <p>Bruna Ferreira, who was released from ICE custody Monday on bond, denies claims that she’s an absentee parent</p>

<p>Bruna Ferreira, who was detained by US <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ice-us-immigration-and-customs-enforcement">Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)</a> in November during a traffic stop in Massachusetts and was being held at a Louisiana detention center, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/12/07/trump-immigration-karoline-leavitt-brother-bruna/">said in an interview with the Washington Post</a> that the White House’s statements that she had never lived with her son or spoken with Leavitt <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/26/karoline-leavitt-nephew-mother-detained-ice">“in many years”</a> were incorrect.</p>

      <p>Donald Trump has loomed large over Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s meeting with European leaders, after the US president took aim at the Ukrainian leader once again. It comes in the wake of a new White House national security strategy that has caused fear in Europe, but drawn praise from the Kremlin. Lucy Hough speaks to our Europe correspondent Jon Henley.</p>

But that feeling of &quot;doing well&quot; isn't even across the board, and those on the lower end of the income spectrum are feeling pinched. We'll discuss, and later we’ll explore how this is playing out in the restaurant scene, too.</p>

      <p>US president’s efforts under harsh spotlight as Rwanda-DRC deal and Thailand-Cambodia mediations waver</p>
<p>For the sake of anyone confused by Donald Trump’s apparently supernatural abilities as a global peacemaker – for which he was given <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/dec/05/fifa-peace-prize-trump-world-cup-infantino">the inaugural (and perhaps only) Fifa “peace prize”</a> – current events have intervened to offer some clarification.</p>
<p>Trump has claimed a number of dubious diplomatic successes on the international peace front, among them a freshly signed deal between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, mediating in Thailand and Cambodia’s deadly border dispute, and the Gaza “ceasefire”.</p>

(date: 2025-12-08)
      <p>
      <p>Siembra in North Carolina gives owners fourth amendment rights trainings should federal agents show up at their door</p>
<p>When Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection agents descended on North Carolina last month, many local businesses were ready to push back. Posted on store- and restaurant-front windows across the state were signs reading: “private area”, “fourth amendment workplace” and “There’s always room at our table, but to enter past this point, we’ll need to see a warrant signed by a judge.”</p>
<p>The signs are part of a new fourth amendment strategy launched by the North Carolina immigrant rights group Siembra, to teach business owners their rights if federal agents show up at their door. While most Americans can name the rights protected by the first and second amendments, far fewer are familiar with the fourth, which prohibits unreasonable government searches and seizures. Siembra is working to change that, seeing the fourth amendment as a vital tool in fighting against the Trump administration’s brutal immigration crackdowns.</p>

      <h1>The once formidable Kansas City Chiefs look old, tired and out of ideas</h1>

(date: 2025-12-08)
      <p>
      <p>Patrick Mahomes has led his team to seven straight AFC Championship Games, winning three Super Bowls on the way. That run appears to be over</p>
<p>This is how great runs end. Not with a single catastrophic collapse, but with a slow drift towards the finish, looking old, tired and out of ideas. For the Chiefs, that sense of finality arrived on Sunday night, delivered by the Texans in a 20-10 defeat at home that felt more lopsided than the score.</p>
<p>For much of this season, there had been a gnawing sense of inevitability about the Chiefs. Whether judging by the eye test or the advanced data, this year’s group has been <em>slightly</em> better than the 15-win team who trudged through one-score victories last season, got hot in the playoffs and then were crushed by the Eagles in the Super Bowl. Even as the losses mounted this year, it felt like the Chiefs still had a run in them. If they could figure out their disjointed offense and find any juice on defense, they could sneak into the playoffs. And in a one-off game, with everything on the line, it would still be hard to look past the Andy Reid-Patrick Mahomes axis.</p>

(date: 2025-12-08)
      <p>
      <p>A new report from Stanford and Common Sense Media finds that more than half of U.S. teens use AI chatbots for companionship. But, according to Dr. Darja Djordjevic, an adolescent and adult psychiatrist who co-authored the research, the bots aren't equipped to provide the kind of emotional support young people need when dealing with a mental health issue.</p>
<p>Dr. Djordjevic and her team simulated conversations involving various mental health concerns with four of the most popular consumer chatbots and identified several risks; chiefly, their tendency to be sycophantic. A note, this conversation mentions suicide and self-harm.</p>

(date: 2025-12-08)
      <p>
      <p>Speaking at the Kennedy Center on Sunday night, Donald Trump said the Ukrainian president 'hasn’t yet read' the latest US-authored peace proposal for the war in Ukraine. Trump added: 'Russia is, I believe, fine with [the deal], but I'm not sure that Zelenskyy's fine with it. His people love it but he hasn't read it.' The US president's comments come after days of negotiations between US and Ukrainian officials ended on Saturday without an apparent breakthrough. Zelenskyy will be received in London by the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, along with the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, to discuss the negotiations</p>

Benford and defensive end AJ Epenesa intercepted Joe Burrow on consecutive plays from scrimmage, leading to the Bills scoring three touchdowns in a span of 4:20 in the fourth quarter.</p>

<p>“These are Americans that he is calling ‘garbage,’” Omar, a Somalia-born Democrat, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpJFEHFDmS8">said</a> while responding to the president’s remarks on CBS’s Face the Nation. “I think it is also really important for us to remember that this kind of hateful rhetoric – and this level of dehumanizing – can lead to dangerous actions by people who listen to the president.”</p>

      <p>Jamaican-born US army veteran faces deportation as more non-US citizen military members are swept up by ICE raids</p>
<p>The fiancee of a Jamaican-born, decorated US army veteran who is now facing deportation under the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> says she hopes his story might inspire legislative action to restore immigration protections for former military members.</p>
<p>“If you served this country, you deserve a chance to stay in this country,” said April Watkins, who is engaged to Godfrey Wade, one of tens of thousands who have been put in immigration detention under Donald Trump’s second presidency. “That is the hope for not only him but for any veteran who sits in a detention center. Look at their service that they gave this country and take that into consideration.”</p>

      <p>‘Make America healthy again’ leaders call for Lee Zeldin to quit for favoring chemical companies over US families</p>
<p>“Make America healthy again” (Maha) movement leaders have <a href="https://www.change.org/p/petition-to-remove-epa-administrator-lee-zeldin">put out a petition</a> calling for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> to fire Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) administrator Lee Zeldin, who, since being appointed in late January, has quickly moved to undo toxic chemical regulations and fast-track pesticide approvals.</p>
<p>The petition represents the latest salvo in a growing <a href="https://apnews.com/article/rfk-jr-maha-trump-health-care-vaccines-75df844c9995aaa92645393321eecd8c">Maha-Maga feud</a> over the Trump administration’s policies around toxic chemicals and pesticides.

      <p>
      <p>For young Americans, not being able to buy a house is more than a sob story. It’s the symbol of a broken social contract and a generational betrayal</p>
<p>Almost every couple that I know in their 20s, 30s or even 40s has had the same argument with their parents before getting married.</p>
<p>The parents say to open a wedding registry. The couple responds that they do not want one. They don’t expect gifts from wedding guests (their “presence is enough”), and they have been <a href="https://www.bgsu.edu/content/dam/BGSU/college-of-arts-and-sciences/NCFMR/documents/FP/lamidi-cohab-prev-and-never-married-fp-15-21.pdf">cohabiting</a> for years and already have plates, bedsheets and a blender. In fact, since they live in a small rented apartment, they barely have room for the plates that they do have – let alone a set of china.</p>

      <p>Conservatives warned of a mass exodus if the democratic socialist won, but experts, and property data, paint a very different picture</p>
<p>The warnings were stark. If Zohran Mamdani were to win the New York City mayoral election, his plans to raise taxes – slightly – on the city’s wealthiest residents would cause millionaires to bolt en masse, decamping to lower-tax states such as Florida and Texas.</p>
<p>The New York Post, a conservative tabloid owned by Rupert Murdoch, told readers on <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=nypost+people+flee+new+york+mamdani+october&amp;oq=nypost+people+flee+new+york+mamdani+october&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIHCAEQIRiPAjIHCAIQIRiPAtIBCTEwNjE0ajBqN6gCALACAA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">an almost daily basis</a> through October that New York would effectively become a ghost town under Mamdani’s mayoralty, a propaganda campaign that concluded the day before the election with the bombastic claim that <a href="https://nypost.com/2025/11/03/us-news/nearly-a-million-new-yorkers-ready-to-flee-nyc-if-mamdani-becomes-mayor-poll/">“nearly a million”</a> people were planning to “flee”.</p>

<p>The woman who publicly alleged that she was 17 when a longtime Roman Catholic priest in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/alabama">Alabama</a> successfully offered her financial support in exchange for sex and other forms of private companionship – recently prompting him to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/28/robert-sullivan-alabama-catholic-priest">resign</a> from the clergy – says “there is no real winner in this situation”.</p>
<p>In her first remarks since Robert “Bob” Sullivan’s self-imposed removal from the priesthood was announced by his church superiors, Heather Jones wrote in a statement that the only thing she gained was “truth finally coming to light after years of gaslighting myself into thinking it wasn’t a big deal”.</p>

      <p>A soaring stock market rewards the already well-off but Trump’s handling of the economy has caused his approval ratings to plunge</p>
<p>Entering Printemps in downtown New York City feels like an escape. A slight smell of musk hangs in the air as shoppers weave carefully around racks of coats and shelves of handbags and shoes. For the holidays, the store set up a small ice rink on its second floor where skaters perform on weekends.</p>
<p>The French luxury retail emporium opened its first <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york">New York</a> outlet earlier this year and has said it wants shoppers to feel so comfortable that it feels like their own chic “French apartment”. The store has a bar upstairs, along with a roving champagne cart, and encourages shoppers to sip on their drinks while they browse. Plush carpeting in the dressing room, full of orange and reds, is reminiscent of a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/wes-anderson">Wes Anderson</a> movie set.</p>

      <h1>Double-post salvation gives Busquets and Alba a fitting farewell in MLS Cup final</h1>

(date: 2025-12-07)
      <p>
      <p>Inter Miami survived a remarkable double-post escape before Messi and friends sealed the club’s first MLS Cup, giving Busquets and Alba a storybook farewell</p>
<p>The ball was going over the line. Surely. Definitely. Inter Miami would be behind. Lionel Messi’s chance at capturing the trophy he most wanted to win would be teetering on a knife’s edge. And perhaps most distressingly to Inter Miami, two retiring legends, Sergi Busquets and Jordi Alba, would be closing in on ignominious ends. They would have come to MLS to accompany Messi, their friend, but would end their time on the field as losers of a final, the type of game they so often won at club and international level.</p>
<p>All that ball had to do was cross the line. The Vancouver Whitecaps’ Emmanuel Sabbi had imbued it with a seeming destiny after a virtuoso run into the heart of the Inter Miami defense. His left-footed effort wrapped around the outstretched hand of Miami goalkeeper Rocco Ríos Novo. It smacked the inside of the far post. It bounced on the line.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>As the confetti flew, the Philip F Anschutz trophy was lifted into the air, and a player commonly thought to be the greatest ever to kick a ball celebrated the 48th title of his professional career, it was nearly impossible to believe that at several points, there were doubts. Serious doubts. Questions, large and small, about this Inter Miami squad, their manager, and nearly every player on the roster other than Lionel Messi.</p>
<p>Consider them answered. The Herons are MLS Cup champions after a 3-1 win over the Vancouver Whitecaps in the last game at their temporary home, Chase Stadium in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Next year, they will open their new stadium, Miami Freedom Park, as champions, and will face a high bar to clear to top a turbulent 2025 that saw them play 58 games – an all-time MLS record for games played by a team in a calendar year – for five separate trophies.</p>

      <h1>‘Mouthpieces for Trump’: inside the rightwing takeover of the Pentagon press corps</h1>

(date: 2025-12-06)
      <p>
      <p>Pentagon press passes once held by credentialed journalists are now in the hands of rightwing pundits and Trump allies</p>
<p>Being a member of the Pentagon press corps was once one of the more prestigious assignments in US journalism, a position reserved for heavy hitters from venerable newspapers and news channels, reporters at the peak of their powers.</p>
<p>Not any more. A press conference last week – held at a crucial time for a Pentagon embroiled in scandal – was instead attended by more than a dozen rightwing activists, with the government being held to account by a close ally of Donald Trump, an employee at Turning Point USA and someone from a pillow salesman’s nascent media company.</p>

      <h1>‘My legacy is not Charlie Kirk’: the university president building a culture of peace after violence</h1>

(date: 2025-12-06)
      <p>
      <p>Astrid Tuminez, Utah Valley University’s first female leader, had to pivot from personal tragedy to address ‘a wounding that happened to all of us’</p>
<p>Astrid Tuminez was on her way to Rome, the trip a kind of pilgrimage after months of grief. Her husband, Jeffrey Tolk, had died suddenly earlier in the year, and the loss had left her carrying a weight she couldn’t set down. “I felt darkness and a rage I’d never known before. It was like a tectonic shift in my reality,” she said.</p>
<p>Tuminez imagined quiet days walking through old churches, sitting in dim chapels in Rome. As part of her spiritual healing, she hoped her schedule held a meeting with Pope Leo. But as her flight landed in Atlanta for a short connection, her phone lit up. One sentence, again and again: “ <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/charlie-kirk-shooting">Charlie has been shot.</a>”</p>

      <h1>Pressure grows on ‘reckless’ Hegseth as twin scandals engulf Pentagon chief</h1>

(date: 2025-12-06)
      <p>
      <p>Defense secretary defiant but allegations of war crimes and blistering watchdog report increase calls for him to go</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pete-hegseth">Pete Hegseth</a> is facing the most serious crisis of his tenure as defense secretary, engulfed by allegations of war crimes in the Caribbean and a blistering <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/documents/1ba8ad2c-5e41-4c54-ba1d-78e5feb66a2e.pdf">inspector general report</a> accusing him of mishandling classified military intelligence. Yet despite the long list of trouble and as lawmakers from both parties call for his resignation, Hegseth shows no signs of stepping down and still holds Donald Trump’s support.</p>
<p>The twin crises have engulfed the former Fox News personality in separate but overlapping allegations that lawmakers, policy experts and former officials say reveal a pattern of dangerous recklessness at the helm of the Pentagon. Democratic legislators have reignited calls for his ouster after revelations that survivors clinging to wreckage from a September boat strike were deliberately killed in a “double-tap” attack, while a defense department investigation released on Thursday concluded he violated Pentagon policies by sharing sensitive details via the Signal messaging app hours before airstrikes in Yemen.</p>

      <p>Pediatricians say panel’s decision will create confusion and access issues, and condemn ‘parody of public health’</p>
<p>The entire US childhood vaccine schedule is now open for scrutiny, experts say, after government vaccine advisers took up discussions of the safety and efficacy of the vaccines and their components and changed its recommendations on one crucial prevention.</p>
<p>Several of the vaccine advisers are longtime anti-vaccine activists, and they were all chosen by Donald Trump’s controversial health secretary Robert F. Kennedy after he fired the previous advisers in an unprecedented move to enact dramatic changes to US vaccination policy. Kennedy has been a frequent critic of vaccines.</p>

      <p>
      <p>England will face a rematch of their 2018 semi-final in the opening fixture of their World Cup campaign next summer, after they were drawn alongside Croatia in Group L. England will also play Panama, another side they faced at the Russia World Cup, and Ghana.</p>
<p>At the draw in Washington DC, which lasted more than two hours after 90 minutes of preamble, there were a number of strong groups selected. Scotland will also face a partial repeat of their last World Cup campaign in 1998 after they were drawn alongside Brazil and Morocco, as well as Haiti, in Group C.</p>
<p>The most prominent candidate for the title of 'Group of Death' is Group I, where the seeds France are joined by Senegal and Erling Haaland’s Norway alongside the winner of an international playoff. USA face Australia, Paraguay and a European playoff winner.</p>
<p>Here is our Nick Ames with his takeaways from the draw.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Each nation’s World Cup is defined, for good or bad, by huge, indelible moments. With a favorable draw, the onus is now on the US to create them</p>
<p>Christian Pulisic vividly remembers watching it with his family. So does Tyler Adams, who saw it with his friends from soccer camp. Memories of Tim Howard catching an Algerian header in Pretoria, and hurling it upfield to ignite the counterattack that would lead to Landon Donovan’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbn3rOPmR9w&amp;t=56s">instantly iconic</a> goal. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wm7ievQ2bHo">The goal</a> that spared the United States men’s national team’s blushes at the 2010 World Cup, sneaking them out of the group stage at Algeria’s expense. One of the most iconic moments in US socer history.</p>
<p>Pulisic was a few months from turning 12. Adams had just turned 10. Matt Turner would be 16 the next day, and Howard’s heroics made him wonder if he ought to devote himself fully to becoming a goalkeeper.</p>

      <p>Text signed by president seems to echo ‘great replacement’ theory, saying Europe faces ‘civilisational erasure’</p>
<p>Donald Trump’s administration has said Europe faces “civilisational erasure” within the next two decades as a result of migration and EU integration, arguing in a policy document that the US must “cultivate resistance” within the continent to “Europe’s current trajectory”.</p>
<p>Billed as “a roadmap to ensure America remains the greatest and most successful nation in human history and the home of freedom on earth”, the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-National-Security-Strategy.pdf">US National Security Strategy</a> makes explicit Washington’s support for Europe’s nationalist far-right parties.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Judge seems skeptical of administration’s case and whether any crisis justifying deployment still exists in Los Angeles</p>
<p>The judge presiding over California’s lawsuit against the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> challenged the federal government’s authority and rationale for continuing to maintain command over the national guard troops it deployed to Los Angeles earlier this year.</p>
<p>The Trump administration federalized the state’s national guard in June, dispatching about 4,000 troops in response to protests in the city over immigration raids, despite opposition from the state’s governor, Gavin Newsom. The state quickly filed a lawsuit, with Newsom calling the move unprecedented and illegal, and the case has been unfolding in the courts for months.</p>

<p>Brian Cole Jr, 30, of Woodbridge, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/virginia">Virginia</a>, appeared before Magistrate Judge Moxila Upadhyaya Friday afternoon in Washington DC to face two explosives-related charges on the day after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/04/dc-pipe-bomb-attack-arrest-january-6">his arrest</a>.

      <h1>DoJ moves to eliminate sexual abuse protections for LGBTQ+ people in prisons</h1>

(date: 2025-12-05)
      <p>
      <p>Memo says the policy shift, which advocates call ‘reckless’, was designed to align with one of Trump’s anti-trans orders</p>
<p>The US Department of Justice has moved to eliminate rules protecting LGBTQ+ people from sexual abuse in prisons, a shift advocates say is “reckless and dangerous” and will lead to increased assaults behind bars.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://prismreports.org/2025/12/04/prison-rape-elimination-act-trans-intersex-trump-doj/">justice department memo</a> issued on Tuesday said “effective immediately”, prisons and jails will no longer be held responsible for violations of standards meant to shield LGBTQ+ people from harassment, abuse and rape. It also directed inspectors to stop auditing facilities for compliance with those protections. The justice department is in the process of seeking formal updates to the rules, the memo said.</p>

<p>B.C. Premier David Eby says he is open to revising the province's Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act (DRIPA). His comments come after B.C.'s Court of Appeal found that the legislation is incompatible with the province's current system used to grant mineral rights because it fails to ensure First Nations are notified when claims are made in their territory.</p>

(date: 2025-12-05)
      <p>
      <p>Reform UK leader’s legal threats, denials and attacks on the media are tactics often deployed by US president</p>
<p>When Nigel Farage angrily denounced the BBC and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/dec/04/farage-turns-on-broadcasters-racism-allegations-bbc">insulted one of its presenters</a> for raising questions about his alleged schoolboy racism, those who have been studying the tactics of the right noted that his behaviour felt familiar.</p>
<p>“Is it out of the Trump playbook? I think that’s exactly what’s going on,” said Steven Barnett, a professor of communications at the University of Westminster. “This is becoming his new modus operandi, turning defence into attack. It’s exactly the tactics White House press secretary, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/28/karoline-leavitt-white-house-press-conference">Karoline Leavitt</a>, uses. There are a lot of journalists in this country who just aren’t used to it.”</p>

      <h1>Science journal retracts study on safety of Monsanto’s Roundup: ‘serious ethical concerns’</h1>

(date: 2025-12-05)
      <p>
      <p>Paper published in 2000 found glyphosate was not harmful, while internal emails later revealed company’s influence</p>
<p>The journal Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273230099913715">has formally retracted</a> a sweeping scientific paper published in 2000 that became a key defense for Monsanto’s claim that Roundup herbicide and its active ingredient glyphosate don’t cause cancer.</p>
<p>Martin van den Berg, the journal’s editor in chief, said in a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273230099913715">note</a> accompanying the retraction that he had taken the step because of “serious ethical concerns regarding the independence and accountability of the authors of this article and the academic integrity of the carcinogenicity studies presented”.</p>
<p>The paper, titled Safety Evaluation and Risk Assessment of the Herbicide Roundup and Its Active Ingredient, Glyphosate, for Humans, concluded that Monsanto’s glyphosate-based weed killers posed no health risks to humans – no cancer risks, no reproductive risks, no adverse effects on development of endocrine systems in people or animals.</p>

<p>The Trump administration has moved to formalize a crackdown on the issuance of visas for people who it deems to have engaged in censoring the free speech of US citizens.</p>
<p>The action, detailed in a state department memo sent to overseas missions this week, first <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-administration-orders-enhanced-vetting-applicants-h-1b-visa-2025-12-04/">reported by Reuters</a> and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/12/04/nx-s1-5633444/trump-content-moderation-visas-censorship">then NPR</a>, directs consular officials to deny visas to any applicant “responsible for, or complicit in, censorship or attempted censorship of protected expression in the US”.</p>

      <h1>Spotify Wrapped, user data, and FOMO</h1>

(date: 2025-12-05)
      <p>
      <p>How wired into your brain are tech companies? Spotify offers us a clue. The streaming company runs its Spotify Wrapped marketing campaign every December, taking user data and AI to create a personalized year-in-review for every listener — and it's an incredibly effective marketing move that consumers want to be a part of. Also: a preview of the last Fed meeting of the year and a manufacturing CEO's thoughts on tariffs and factory activity.</p>

      <h1>Pam Bondi tells law enforcement agencies to investigate antifa groups for ‘tax crimes’</h1>

(date: 2025-12-05)
      <p>
      <p>Move is part of Trump’s broader crackdown on leftwing groups, including designation of antifa as ‘domestic terrorism’ group</p>

</ul>
<p>The US attorney general, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pam-bondi">Pam Bondi</a>, instructed law enforcement officials on Thursday to investigate <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/25/us-antifa-groups-terror-list">antifa</a> and other supposeddomestic terror groups, and specifically directed them to search for “tax crimes” the groups may have committed, according to a memo obtained by the Guardian.</p>
<p>The document signals how the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> and Bondi are ramping up efforts to crack down on leftwing groups. Antifa, short for antifascist, is not a clearly defined organization, but rather a loose network of activists. Trump <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/22/trump-executive-order-antifa-terrorist-organization">signed an executive order</a> in September declaring it a domestic terrorism organization – something legal experts say he does not have the authority to do.</p>

<p>Tashante McCoy was celebrating her grandson’s fifth birthday in Stockton, California, on Saturday, when she learned that masked men had opened fire at another child’s birthday party on the other side of town.</p>
<p>Armed men had walked into the banquet hall where at least 100 people had gathered to celebrate a toddler’s birthday, a friend of McCoy’s who was at the event would later tell her. At least one man opened fire just as partygoers were preparing to cut the cake.</p>

      <p>Defenders rally to Olivia Nuzzi amid book mockery, while rakish David Dimbleby channels his inner Dickens</p>
<p>It’s publication week for American Canto, the hastily turned around memoir by the former New York magazine journalist Olivia Nuzzi, who took on the challenge of explaining what it was about Robert F Kennedy Jr she found so alluring, a task for which no upper word limit is adequate. Nuzzi, if you’ve fallen behind, developed romantic feelings for the then presidential candidate, now Trump health minister, while profiling him for the magazine and since I’ve had to read this sentence, you do too: “He was exhausted, and he threw himself onto the bed, his pink shirt unbuttoned, revealing my favorite parts of his chest.” If you have a favourite part of RFK Jr’s chest, or consider chests in general subject to preference by localised area, this may be the book for you.</p>

      <h1>Netflix is buying Warner Bros. Discovery</h1>

(date: 2025-12-05)
      <p>
      <p>Following a fierce bidding war, Netflix announced this morning that it’s buying Warner Bros. Discovery in a deal worth more than $82 billion. The deal still has to be approved by regulators, and some lawmakers are already raising antitrust concerns. We learn more. Then, as part of our lunar economy mini-series, we hear what a lack of private interest oversight could mean for an economy beyond the clouds.</p>

      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Major airports in India have descended into chaos after the airline IndiGo either canceled or delayed hundreds of flights for the fourth consecutive day. IndiGo says there have been technical issues with aircraft or winter schedules that have delayed some flights, but the biggest reason is a pilot shortage. Also, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda have signed a peace deal, and some countries are boycotting Eurovision over Israel's involvement.</p>

      <h1>Bytes: Week in Review -  Amazon scales back AI anime dubs</h1>

(date: 2025-12-05)
      <p>
      <p>The Trump administration has been trying for months to ban AI regulations at the state level. And its latest gambit to roll such a measure into the congressional National Defense Authorization Act appears to have failed. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise said Tuesday that GOP leadership is now <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/03/another-bid-to-block-state-ai-regulation-has-failedfor-now/">“looking at other places”</a> to include that measure after reportedly facing pushback from both parties.</p>
<p>Plus, New York recently became the first state to enforce an AI law designed to protect consumers from &quot;algorithmic pricing.&quot; And Amazon pulled back on AI dubbing for some international content after anime fans complained.</p>

      <h1>Inter Miami’s journey to MLS Cup has been methodical, and Messi-centered</h1>

(date: 2025-12-05)
      <p>
      <p>Ever since the club’s very beginning, David Beckham and Jorge Mas have had moments like this Saturday in mind</p>
<p>Back on 27 February 2020, days before Inter Miami’s first-ever fixture in MLS, I stood next to the club’s managing owner, Jorge Mas, and co-owner David Beckham as part of an MLS press junket in New York City. I was there for Sports Illustrated and my show Planet Fútbol TV, which I co-hosted with my friend, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/10/grant-wahl-death-world-cup-qatar-2022-tribute-soccer">the late, great Grant Wahl</a>. We were adamant that the Inter Miami story was riveting, not just because of Beckham’s influence in MLS, but also because his new club was about to introduce the unique culture of Miami and south Florida – the Latin American capital of the world – to the league.</p>
<p>The conversation in 2020 was my second meeting with Mas and my first with Beckham. I remember the sense of excitement from both men, knowing that this Inter Miami project – seven years in the making before their debut in the league – was about to come to fruition after a long, arduous journey. From legal battles with Internazionale over the trademark of the word “Inter” to political and structural problems as they tried to make a stadium, Miami Freedom Park, a reality. Now, the club was finally starting life in MLS.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/17/who-is-maurene-comey-fired-federal-prosector">Maurene Comey</a>, the federal prosecutor who helmed criminal cases against Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, appeared at Manhattan federal court on Thursday, in a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/15/epstein-prosecutor-maurene-comey-lawsuit">lawsuit</a> claiming she was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/16/maurene-comey-fired-sources">fired</a> as political retaliation against her father, James Comey.</p>
<p>Comey was terminated in July, shortly after the federal trial of Sean “Diddy” Combs, whose prosecution she led; he was found guilty of prostitution-related crimes. Comey’s lawsuit contends that Donald Trump’s justice department axed her without explanation or cause, and instead simply cited “article 2 of the United States constitution and the laws of the United States” in an email.</p>

      <h1>US supreme court approves redrawn Texas congressional maps</h1>

(date: 2025-12-04)
      <p>
      <p>Major win for Trump as justices reject lower-court ruling that found maps had been racially gerrymandered</p>
<p>Texas can use a redrawn congressional map that adds as many as five Republican-friendly seats, the supreme court has ruled, giving Donald Trump and the GOP a major win in their push to add Republican congressional seats ahead of next year’s midterm elections.</p>
<p>The supreme court’s decision came after a 2-1 ruling from a three-judge panel striking down Texas’s new map in November. The majority found the state had likely sorted voters based on their race – an unlawful practice called racial gerrymandering – when they adopted the new maps. The majority ordered the state to use the maps it had adopted after the 2020 census for next year’s election.</p>

<p>The city’s immigrant communities remain terrified and traumatized, advocates said, with many in hiding as people have been arrested in public spaces including parking lots outside Home Depots and Lowe’s hardware stores, at bus stops, shopping malls and in residential areas around the city.</p>

<p>Odermatt finished in 1min 29.84sec to surpass Cochran-Siegle by .30sec. Norway’s Adrian Smiseth Sejersted finished third. The finish line was moved up the hill – and just barely visible by fans in the stands – due to a lack of snow to properly place the safety netting.</p>

<p>A California student has been sentenced to 90 days in jail after breaking into a Petaluma poultry and taking four chickens in an effort she called a “rescue”.</p>
<p>Zoe Rosenberg, a 23-year-old student at the University of California, Berkeley, was convicted of felony conspiracy and three misdemeanor counts in October. On Wednesday, a jury sentenced her to 90 days – 60 of which may involve jail alternates, such as house arrest – far less than the four and a half year maximum sentence she could have faced. The jury also ordered Rosenberg to pay more than $100,000 to Petaluma Poultry, the Perdue Farms facility from which she took four chickens in 2023. Rosenberg has been ordered to report to the Sonoma county jail on 10 December.</p>

On Thursday, US navy admiral Frank Bradley, who commanded the attack, and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Dan Caine, appeared before the House and Senate’s armed services and intelligence committees for a closed briefing in which they showed video and discussed the attack with lawmakers.</p>

<p>New York City’s mayor, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/eric-adams">Eric Adams</a>, has issued two executive orders he says are meant to combat antisemitism, less than a month before he hands over the keys to the mayoralty to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/zohran-mamdani">Zohran Mamdani</a>, an outspoken critic of Israel.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nyc.gov/content/dam/nycgov/mayors-office/downloads/pdf/executive-orders/2025/eo-60.pdf?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_name=&amp;utm_source=govdelivery">The first order</a> prohibits city agency heads and staff from engaging in “any policy that discriminates against the state of Israel, Israeli citizens based on their national origin, or individuals or entities based on their association with Israel”. It also prohibits officials overseeing the city pension system from making decisions in line with the boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) movement, which Mamdani has said he supports.</p>

      <p>An investigation found defense secretary put US forces at risk, triggering fresh demands for his resignation</p>
<p>The Department of Defense’s inspector general released the much-anticipated unclassified <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2025/Dec/04/2003834916/-1/-1/1/DODIG_2026_021.PDF">report</a> on Thursday about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pete-hegseth">Pete Hegseth</a>’s disclosure of plans for military airstrikes in Yemen in a Signal group chat earlier this year.</p>
<p>It found that Hegseth violated departmental policies when he shared information in the chat, and that if a foreign enemy force intercepted that information it could have endangered the lives of US troops, as the Guardian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/03/hegseth-yemen-signal-group-chat">reported on Wednesday</a>. “Using a personal cell phone to conduct official business and send nonpublic DoD information through Signal risks potential compromise of sensitive DoD information, which could cause harm to DoD personnel and mission objectives,” the report said.</p>

<p>The meeting of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) turned confrontational at times before one member introduced a motion to delay the vote, which passed by six to three, to give advisers time to examine the wording before taking a vote.</p>

<p>As Donald Trump went on another extended racist tirade against Somalis on Wednesday, Minneapolis activists prepared for more targeting of the community by conducting trainings on their rights and planning how they would protect their neighbors.</p>
<p>In the White House on Wednesday, a reporter asked the president about Minneapolis’s mayor, Jacob Frey, who has defended the Somali community. Trump responded: “I wouldn’t be proud to have the largest Somalian – look at their nation. Look how bad their nation is. It’s not even a nation. It’s just people walking around killing each other. Look, these Somalians have taken billions of dollars out of our country. Billions and billions.”</p>

<p>Croatia are the highest-ranked potential Pot 2 opponents (10th) and reached the final and the semi-finalis at the past two World Cups respectively but, with a maximum of two European teams in each group, drawing them would eliminate for England the possibility of facing Erling Haaland’s Norway, who are in Pot 3, or Italy, who are in Pot 4, if the four-time champions <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/nov/20/world-cup-playoff-draw-wales-bosnia-northern-ireland-italy-ireland-czech-republic">get through the playoffs in March</a>.</p>

      <h1>California wine grapes rot on the vine</h1>

(date: 2025-12-04)
      <p>
      <p>These days, Americans are drinking less alcohol. While that may be a positive from a health perspective, it’s not great news for California grape growers. Industry groups predict that 2025 will be the smallest harvest since the mid-’90s. These changing consumption habits are changing the landscape of California vineyards. Also, the Trump administration is reducing fuel efficiency standards, and layoffs are running high ahead of the next Federal Reserve meeting.</p>

<p>With a president who has called <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-crisis">climate change</a> a “ <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/fact-checking-trump-climate-change-general-assembly/story?id=125855451">hoax</a>”, refused to send a delegation to international climate talks, and packed the federal government with former fossil fuel industry employees, this can feel like a dark moment for climate action in the US.

<p>Analysts have <a href="https://assets.bbhub.io/dotorg/sites/28/2019/12/Accelerating-Americas-Pledge.pdf">estimated</a> that 75% of the commitments that the US made at the Paris climate agreement – which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> pulled the nation out of as soon as he took office – can be reached entirely without federal support.</p>

<p>It was the kind of cold, damp morning that makes it hard to get out of bed, much less get a child out the door. The sun had not even risen when five-year-old Thomas Cooper and his mother, Annie Cooper, arrived for an appointment on 31 January at the Oxford Center in Troy, a northern suburb of Detroit, Michigan.</p>
<p>Thomas was an exuberant child with a button nose and pinchable cheeks – a little kid who loved running fast, playing Minecraft and watching Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, according to a GoFundMe set up by his family. He had just received money in a special red envelope for lunar new year, and he planned to spend it later that day with his little brother. But first, he was going to receive hyperbaric oxygen therapy for his attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and sleep apnea.</p>

      <h1>Trump’s sweeping changes to US immigration policy – here’s what to know</h1>

(date: 2025-12-04)
      <p>
      <p>President orders pause on asylum claims and extra scrutiny of migrants from 19 countries after Washington shooting</p>
<p>Donald Trump is seizing on the shooting of two national guard members, allegedly by an Afghan man, to press his immigration crackdown still farther. In the aftermath of the attack, which left guard member Sarah Beckstrom dead and colleague Andrew Wolfe in critical condition, Trump directed US Citizenship and Immigration Services to pause all pending asylum applications.</p>
<p>USCIS followed up that announcement with more seismic shifts to immigration policy. This is how the White House is reshaping the process for requesting asylum, green cards and citizenship.</p>

<p>During his first term, Trump issued 237 acts of clemency – including to someone who was a predatory lender and drug smuggler and to another who ran a Ponzi scheme. Since taking office again, Trump has issued more than 1,600, most for people involved in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/20/trump-executive-orders-jan-6-pardons">January 6 attack</a> on Congress.</p>

      <p>Amnesty finds detainees at Florida facility were shackled and left outside in metal cage. Plus, how the dollar-store industry overcharges consumers</p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>Detainees at the notorious Florida immigration jail known as “Alligator Alcatraz” were shackled inside a 2ft-high metal cage and left outside without water for up to a day at a time, a shocking report published on Thursday by Amnesty International alleges.</p>
<p><strong>Didn’t a judge order the facility to shut down?</strong> A federal judge in August <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/21/trump-alligator-alcatraz-judge-ruling">ordered it to close</a> after a wave of criticism and a lawsuit by environmental groups. However, by October, the facility was operating again with hundreds of detainees after two Trump-appointed appellate court judges – one whose husband <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/02/alligator-alcatraz-ron-desantis-paul-huck">has close ties</a> to the Republican governor Ron DeSantis – blocked the closure ruling.</p>
<p><strong>Has the state of Florida responded to the allegations?</strong> The press secretary to DeSantis told the Guardian the allegations were “fabrications” and part of a “politically motivated attack”.</p>
<p><strong>Why have they released these photos now?</strong> It’s unclear. Even though the images do not reveal anything new, they keep the pressure on the Trump administration ahead of a 19 December deadline for the justice department to release files, as per the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/18/house-vote-epstein-documents">Epstein Files Transparency Act</a>, signed 19 November.</p>

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> European antitrust regulators have just launched an investigation into Meta over its rollout of artificial intelligence features on WhatsApp for European users. This move marks the latest action by European regulators against large technology firms, as the trade bloc seeks to balance support for the sector with efforts to curb its expanding influence. Then, air travelers in India face continued disruptions, and Japan tries to regain a stronghold in semiconductor chip manufacturing.</p>

<p>Graphic depictions of two survivors being killed by a second US military strike on an alleged Venezuelan drug ferrying boat have provoked outrage where previously there was none – or at least relatively little.</p>
<p>A firestorm of controversy has greeted a recent Washington Post report which suggested that a deadly attack on a vessel carrying 11 people in the Caribbean was followed with a second assault after the initial strike failed to kill everybody onboard.</p>

      <h1>RFK Jr’s vaccine advisory panel to weigh delaying hepatitis B shots to newborns</h1>

(date: 2025-12-04)
      <p>
      <p>Experts say any change to the hepatitis B schedule could have significant and far-reaching consequences</p>
<p>Robert F Kennedy Jr’s vaccine advisory committee convenes on Thursday to consider a reversal of a decades-long program of childhood immunizations, including a recommendation to delay hepatitis B shots for newborn babies.</p>
<p>For decades, federal health recommendations have suggested that all newborns be vaccinated against the virus that can lead to serious liver disease. Kennedy, the US health secretary and a prominent anti-vaccine activist, has long pushed for delaying the shot.</p>

      <h1>Have we given up on data privacy?</h1>

(date: 2025-12-04)
      <p>
      <p>Every day, consumers are confronted with the fragility of our personal data privacy — another data breach, another government agency accessing databases they didn't previously have access to, another consent form popping up to get permission to gather more data.</p>
<p>It's almost too much for any one person to keep a handle on, according to Rohan Grover, professor of artificial intelligence and media at American University. He recently co-authored a piece for The Conversation about why data privacy seems to have largely fallen out of the public discourse, even though he says the topic is more urgent than ever.</p>

      <h1>Wilfried Nancy’s move to Celtic means as much for MLS as it does for him</h1>

(date: 2025-12-04)
      <p>
      <p>New Celtic manager may not be a big name but he won over the US league with leadership style and attractive football</p>
<p>Other managers won more in Major League Soccer than Wilfried Nancy. Bruce Arena, say, certainly has a fuller trophy cabinet. Nancy, however, lifted more than just trophies. He lifted standards. At Columbus Crew, he set a benchmark for the rest, showing what was possible even with limited resources. Columbus <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/nov/29/mls-cup-inter-miami-vancouver-whitecaps-san-diego-nycfc">didn’t have Lionel Messi</a> or Son Heung-min, but they had Nancy as head coach, and that was often enough.</p>
<p>For the past three seasons, the Crew have been the most dynamic, boundary-pushing team in MLS. Nancy’s CF Montreal team weren’t bad either, establishing the style of play that would come to be known as Nancyball. He changed MLS’s managerial landscape for ever. It was only a matter of time until a call came from Europe.</p>

      <h1>Jaxson Dart says the NFL ‘isn’t soccer’. The Giants need him to start acting like a quarterback</h1>

(date: 2025-12-04)
      <p>
      <p>The rookie plays like a linebacker at quarterback. His reckless style is costing his teammates and coaches as well as himself</p>
<p>Jaxson Dart wants you to know something: <em>this is real football</em>. It’s not soccer or flag. It’s tackle football, the kind where quarterbacks go airborne. After <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/01/patriots-giants-monday-night-football">taking the latest</a> in a growing compilation of bone-crushing hits, Dart brushed himself off and delivered a post-game sermon on toughness. “We’re not playing soccer,” he said. “You’re going to get hit. Things happen.”</p>
<p>Yet these “things” continue to happen to Dart at an alarming rate. In his eight NFL starts, he has absorbed as many unnecessary hits as any rookie quarterback in recent memory. On Monday night, Dart <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/01/patriots-giants-monday-night-football">took another heavy hit</a> near the sideline in the first quarter of the Giants’ 33-15 loss to the Patriots. Dart scrambled out of the pocket on second-and-13 and ran for a first down. As he approached the sideline, Dart could have stepped out and gained fewer yards while still moving the chains. Instead, he braced, lowered his shoulder and <a href="https://x.com/OmahaProd/status/1995670356674412922">was sent soaring through the air</a> by Patriots linebacker Christian Elliss.</p>

      <h1>Pentagon watchdog finds Hegseth’s use of Signal posed risk to US personnel, AP sources say</h1>

(date: 2025-12-04)
      <p>
      <p>The Pentagon’s watchdog has found that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth put U.S. personnel and their mission at risk when he used the Signal messaging app to convey sensitive information about a military strike against Houthi militants in Yemen. That's according to two people familiar with the findings on Wednesday. One of the people says Hegseth, however, has the ability to declassify material and the report did not find he did so improperly. Hegseth denied posting classified information regarding plans for a military strike against Houthi militants in Yemen in March. The review by the Pentagon inspector general’s office was delivered to lawmakers, who were able to review the report in a classified facility at the Capitol.</p>

<p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced it had <strong>started its immigration enforcement operation in New Orleans today</strong>.</p>
<p>In a statement, the department said <strong>Operation Catahoula Crunch</strong> would target “criminal illegal aliens roaming free thanks to sanctuary policies”. New Orleans is the latest Democratic-run city (albeit in a Republican-led state) to see federal immigration agents on its streets. Most recently, the Trump administration targeted Charlotte, North Carolina, and touted the arrest of more than 300 undocumented immigrants.</p>

      <h1>Small businesses pull back on hiring</h1>

(date: 2025-12-03)
      <p>
      <p>Small business owners’ economic moods remain mixed. But, as is so often the case, how folks feel is different from how they act. And hard data tells us small business owners are pulling back on hiring — one ADP report shows businesses with fewer than 50 employees cut a net 120,000 jobs in November. Should we be worried? Plus: Retailers benefit from buy now, pay later offerings, import prices sans fuel rose in September, and cap-and-trade carbon emissions programs have changed since their inception.</p>

      <h1>The Clippers’ chaotic unravelling leaves Chris Paul as its most painful casualty</h1>

(date: 2025-12-03)
      <p>
      <p>Los Angeles have turned a feelgood reunion into a late-career humiliation for one of their greatest players – and exposed a franchise stumbling into a darker new era</p>
<p>Pull out your Los Angeles Clippers bingo cards. Anyone have the square marked “owner and star player <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/03/clippers-deny-claims-star-forward-kawhi-leonard-was-paid-28m-for-job-that-didnt-exist">accused of skirting the salary cap</a> through improper means”? Go ahead and stamp that one. How about “losing 14 of 16 after a hopeful 3-2 start”? Mark it. And yes, you can fill in “other star averaging nearly 27 a night at age 36 – including a 50-piece against the Detroit Pistons, one of the league’s best teams”. The box reading “Clippers fans tearing out their hair at alarming rates and contemplating shameful, fairweather defections” is probably safe to cross off, pending review. And after the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/03/clippers-chris-paul-sent-home-stunning-late-night-move">wee-hours media cycle on Wednesday morning</a>, everyone gets to tick the most dispiriting square of all: “beloved, decorated veteran unceremoniously kicked to the curb in his final season”.</p>
<p>The Clippers had posted a winning record every year since 2010-11, building a reputation as one of the NBA’s most reliable playoff fixtures. Twenty-one games into this young season, that identity has dissolved into something hazy around the edges – and unmistakably sinister.</p>

      <p>Report says defense secretary violated policies in sharing secret information in March on planned airstrike in Yemen</p>
<p>A widely awaited Department of Defense report concluded that the defense secretary, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pete-hegseth">Pete Hegseth</a>, violated departmental policies when he shared secret information in a Signal messaging chat in March that included details of a planned airstrike in Yemen against Houthi fighters, said a source familiar with the report.</p>
<p>The Signal chat was disclosed after a reporter for the Atlantic was added as a member. It also included <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jd-vance">JD Vance</a>, the CIA director, John Ratcliffe, and the then-national security adviser, Mike Waltz. The report did not examine the conduct of those officials, since they do not work at the Department of Defense.</p>

<p>As the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> continues military strikes on alleged drug-trafficking boats in the Caribbean, several Republican lawmakers are ramping up scrutiny on the administration over a double strike in early September.</p>
<p>The strikes on suspected drug boats from Venezuela have drawn pushback from both parties – in particular, the second strike on a single boat to kill remaining survivors.

</ul>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>A family in Colombia has filed a petition with the Washington DC-based Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR), alleging that the Colombian citizen Alejandro Carranza Medina was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/02/trump-caribbean-drug-boat-attack-complaint">subject to an “extrajudicial killing”</a> in a US airstrike.</p>
<p><strong>What is the IACHR?</strong> A monitoring body designed to “promote and protect human rights in the western hemisphere”. The US is a member, and the state department said in March it was a “strong supporter of the IACHR”.</p>
<p><strong>H</strong> <strong>ow has the Trump administration responded?</strong> A White House spokesperson, Anna Kelly, did not respond directly to questions about the complaint or about Carranza’s death, but wrote in an email that the media were “now running cover for foreign terrorists smuggling deadly narcotics intended to murder Americans”.</p>
<p><strong>What’s the latest on the front</strong> <strong>lines?</strong> Buoyed up by recent gains, Putin has indicated in recent weeks that the Russian military was prepared to keep fighting if diplomacy faltered, repeatedly emphasising that his forces remained on the offensive on the battlefield.</p>

<p>On a cloudy winter day, a state government inspector named Ryan Coffield walked into a Family Dollar store in Windsor, North Carolina, carrying a scanner gun and a laptop.</p>
<p>Inside the store, which sits along a three-lane road in a county of peanut growers and poultry workers, Coffield scanned 300 items and recorded their shelf prices. He carried the scanned bar codes to the cashier and watched as item after item rang up at a higher price.</p>

<p>Trump administration officials have defended carrying out a follow-up strike on a drug boat that killed survivors on 2 September by arguing that its objective was to ensure the complete destruction of the boat, an action the Pentagon had internal legal approval to conduct.</p>
<p>The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said in a briefing on Monday that Adm Frank Bradley, who oversaw the operation and gave the order for the second strike, directed it to sink the boat.</p>

<p>The Edmonton Police Service will test the use of bodycams that employ facial recognition, a form of artificial intelligence. Starting Wednesday, up to 50 police officers will use the cameras for the remainder of the month. However some academics warn that the technology is still not well-understood or reliable.</p>

      <h1>A Fed divided against itself</h1>

(date: 2025-12-02)
      <p>
      <p>The Federal Reserve’s quantitative approach to monetary policy decisions means its governors tend to reach consensus. But in the past few meetings, some FOMC members have disagreed on whether to prioritize jobs or inflation. In this episode, “Marketplace” host Kai Ryssdal and former FOMC member Daniel Tarullo discuss why the Fed is divided right now. Plus: Dollar stores weather an uncertain economy, companies use return-to-office policies as a workforce reduction mechanism, and electricity demand grows as data centers pop up nationwide.</p>

      <p>Donation of $6.25bn for children’s investment accounts prompts wave of questions – but details remain scarce</p>
<p>A tech billionaire and his wife said on Tuesday they would pour $6.25bn into individual investment accounts for 25 million children under 10, prompting a wave of new questions about how these so-called “Trump accounts” will work.</p>
<p>The creation of these accounts was included as part of Donald Trump’s sprawling tax and spending bill, which he signed into law in July. Every child born between 1 January 2025 and 31 December 2028, can receive a Trump account that includes a $1,000 initial deposit from the administration. The money will then be invested.</p>

<p>The Pentagon on Tuesday scapegoated a navy admiral for the extrajudicial double-tap strike that killed survivors of a 2 September attack on an alleged drug boat and vowed to continue operations, even as lawmakers investigate whether the attack constituted a war crime.</p>
<p>At a Pentagon briefing on Tuesday, Kingsley Wilson, the Pentagon press secretary said that the decision to re-strike the “narco terrorist vessel” was made by Adm Frank M Bradley, “operating under clear and long standing authorities to ensure the boat was destroyed and the threat to the United States was eliminated”. Wilson added that Pete Hegseth, the Pentagon secretary, “stands behind Admiral Bradley, 100%”.</p>

<p>The US men’s national team have lined up a parade of top-tier European opposition to serve as warm-up opponents ahead of their opening game in the 2026 World Cup.</p>
<p>The US Soccer Federation announced on Tuesday that the national team will play Belgium and Portugal in the March Fifa window, with both matches taking place at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta on 28 and 31 March, respectively. Those matches will be followed by two friendlies in the window immediately preceding the World Cup, with the second one coming against Germany in Chicago on 6 June. The first game of the pre-World Cup series is against an opponent to be determined in Charlotte, North Carolina, on 31 May. Multiple reports have indicated that the opponent will be announced after the World Cup draw. (Fifa rules forbid group opponents from playing each other in a friendly ahead of the tournament.)</p>

(date: 2025-12-02)
      <p>
      <p>Two-day meeting under new, RFK Jr-appointed chair could see radical overhaul of US childhood immunizations policy</p>
<p>A reversal of a decades-long program of childhood immunizations, including a recommendation to scrap hepatitis B shots for newborn babies, could come as early as this week in a vote by an advisory committee of allies convened by the US health secretary, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr">Robert F Kennedy Jr</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/12/02/acip-hepatitis-b-childhood-immunization-schedule/">to the Washington Post</a>, Kirk Milhoan, the new chair of the federal advisory panel on immunization practices, said members would vote whether to push for the axing of the hepatitis B requirement during its two-day meeting ending Friday.</p>

</ul>
<p>Serena Williams has taken the procedural move required of any player contemplating a competitive comeback, after the 23-time grand slam singles champion re-entered the International Tennis Integrity Agency’s (ITIA) registered testing pool for the first time since 2022.</p>
<p>Williams, 44, has not played an official match since <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/sep/02/serena-williams-ajla-tomljanovi-us-open-tennis-third-round-retirement">her run to the third round of the US Open</a> more than three years ago. Although she described her departure at the time as “evolving away” from the sport rather than a hard retirement, she filed the paperwork with the ITIA that September that exempted her from the sport’s stringent whereabouts requirements. To return to competition, however, players must make themselves available for out-of-competition testing for six months before they are allowed to enter an event.</p>

<p>A post on social media by US defense secretary <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pete-hegseth">Pete Hegseth</a>, depicting a beloved children’s character aiming a rocket launcher at a cluster of boats, has elicited condemnation from the book’s Canadian publisher.</p>
<p>Hegseth’s post of the mocked cover of a Franklin the Turtle book titled Franklin Targets Narco Terrorists prompted disbelief and outrage. The image shows a smiling anthropomorphic turtle in military helmet and vest, with a US flag on his arm and a drug-laden boat exploding in the background. “For your Christmas wish list,” Hegseth wrote as the caption.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> has ordered a “pause” on asylum claims after last week’s shooting of two national guard members in Washington. The suspect in the shooting, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, is a 29-year-old Afghani national who assisted US forces during the two-decade war there and was paroled into the United States in 2021. US citizenship and immigration services awarded him asylum earlier this year.</p>
<p>It is not clear how long the president’s asylum pause will last. <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/11/30/donald-trump-pause-asylum-applications/87544306007/">Trump told reporters Sunday</a> that the directive “has no time limit, but it could be a long time”.</p>

      <p>Corporate bond spreads, extra compensation that corporate bonds pay out compared to government bonds, have been narrowing this year, which means investors aren’t demanding much additional money to account for additional credit risk. That could indicate that investors think economic growth could pick up in the near term. Also on the program: a trade deal regarding U.K. pharmaceuticals and OPEC's plans to keep oil production flat to start the new year.</p>

      <p>Robots are commonplace in factories, and increasingly in warehouses like those run by Amazon. But what about robots to help with household chores — so-called humanoids to load the dishwasher or fold the laundry?</p>
<p>To find out, we checked in with Ken Goldberg, professor of engineering at UC Berkeley and co-founder of the AI and robotics company Ambi Robotics. He spoke to Marketplace’s Nova Safo en route from a robotics conference in China.</p>

<p>The revelation that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/trinidad-and-tobago">Trinidad and Tobago</a> has approved the installation of a US military radar facility has stoked fears that the Caribbean could be drawn into the escalating crisis between the US and Venezuela.</p>
<p>Trinidad and Tobago’s prime minister, Kamla Persad-Bissessar, had attempted to allay concerns about a US C-17 aircraft that had landed in the country, claiming it was carrying marines to assist with a road construction project. She also claimed she was told that no marines remained in the country.</p>

      <p>Your essential guide to Friday’s draw in Washington DC, including where to watch it, who to watch out for and a look at Fifa’s peace prize</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/world-cup-football">World Cup</a> draw will start at Washington DC’s Kennedy Center at 12pm local time on Friday 5 December (5pm GMT/4am Saturday AEST). Although don’t worry if you tune in late: based on previous draws there will be a few speeches about Fifa being on the verge of bringing about world peace via the medium of football, some interpretive dance about Fifa being on the verge of bringing about world peace via the medium of football, some videos with kids kicking a ball about to show that Fifa is on the verge of bringing about world peace via the medium of football, and then, hopefully, Fifa actually bringing about world peace via the medium of football. And if you miss any of that, don’t worry Fifa will also be awarding a peace prize to the person most likely to bring about world peace in the next few months (more on that zinger later). At some point in all of that, they’ll place teams into groups and at long last give this expanded tournament an actual schedule.</p>

      <h1>Fuzzy Zoeller obituary</h1>

(date: 2025-12-01)
      <p>
      <p>Popular American golfer hailed for winning the US Masters and the US Open</p>
<p>The golfer Fuzzy Zoeller, who has died aged 74, won two majors – the US Masters in 1979 and the US Open in 1984, both by virtue of a playoff. His Masters success was especially notable for the fact that it was Zoeller’s debut in the competition, making him the first golfer since 1935 (and still only the third) to win on his first appearance. He won the sudden-death playoff against Tom Watson and Ed Sneed with a par and a birdie, sinking a six-foot putt on the second extra hole and hurling his putter <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BC-pC_S6aTs">high into the air</a> as the ball disappeared into the cup.</p>
<p>Zoeller’s US Open victory at Winged Foot five years later was remembered for his light-hearted interaction with his play-off rival, Greg Norman. When Norman holed a lengthy putt on the last of the 72 holes, Zoeller, who was behind him on the fairway, mistakenly thought the Australian had gone into the lead, and waved a white towel in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye6_Mx9YmgU">mock surrender</a>. But Norman’s putt had only drawn him level, and Zoeller was able to secure a par on the last to maintain parity. During the subsequent 18-hole playoff, which Zoeller won by eight strokes, Norman returned the gesture by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qq6SG_Qzpxg">flapping</a> his own white towel at the 18th.</p>

<p>Voters on Tuesday will cast ballots in a special election to replace Mark Green, a Republican representing a middle Tennessee district who resigned from Congress in July. Drawn by the state’s Republican leaders to ensure its voters favored their party, the district last year backed Trump and Green by 22-point margins.</p>

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Factories in China have long been an engine of economic growth, so it's worrying for leaders in Beijing that a new survey shows activity unexpectedly contracted in November. It's the eighth straight month that production has shrunk. What's it telling us about the world's second biggest economy? And later, Iran is experiencing an unprecedented drought, with rainfall at record lows and reservoirs nearly empty. Officials are pleading with citizens to conserve water.</p>

      <p>
      <p>In MLS and NWSL alike, edge-of-your-seat contests have delivered indelible moments that even the best title race run-in can’t match</p>
<p>There’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAx6vDNKVAo">a TV commercial</a> that’s been running on Apple TV during MLS games for Lowe’s hardware stores. Lionel Messi carefully places a soccer ball on a field, ready to take a free kick. He is flanked by Lionel Messi and Lionel Messi. On the sideline, manager Lionel Messi, assisted by Lionel Messi, gesticulates. Lionel Messi lays off the ball for Lionel Messi, who crosses it to Lionel Messi. Lionel Messi chests and volleys it into the net and is mobbed by another half dozen Lionel Messis (or is it Lionels Messi?).</p>
<p>Facing Inter Miami in the ongoing MLS playoffs must feel more or less like living inside this ad. Before Saturday’s Eastern Conference final against New York City FC, Messi had either scored or assisted on all 12 goals Miami had scored in the postseason. Messi has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/24/lionel-messi-mls-viewership-attendance-apple-tv">smashed up the league</a> this year, but he has saved the real savagery for the playoffs.</p>

      <h1>In the NFL’s season of meh, even the battered 49ers are Super Bowl contenders</h1>

(date: 2025-12-01)
      <p>
      <p>San Francisco are a flawed team with serious injuries. But with no great teams in the league this year, the playoffs are wide open</p>
<p>The 49ers’ season felt over after <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401772749/49ers-buccaneers">Week 6’s loss to Tampa Bay</a>. Yes, they were 4-2. Yes, they were tied with the Seahawks and Rams and had already won head-to-head games against both. But that’s when they hit rock bottom. All Pro linebacker Fred Warner <a href="https://ninerswire.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/niners/2025/11/28/49ers-fred-warner-injury-update/87510140007/">was the latest casualty</a>, following <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/49ers/article/49ers-star-nick-bosa-spotted-walking-no-crutches-21165974.php">in the footsteps</a> of All Pro edge rusher Nick Bosa with a season-ending injury. Brock Purdy had also struggled with injuries. George Kittle was hurt in Week 1. Both were not expected to return for several games. Brandon Aiyuk had no plans to play any time soon, at least not for San Francisco. By Week 7, the only big names in action were Christian McCaffrey and Trent Williams.</p>
<p>Dire as the 49ers appeared on paper, they hung in. It helped that the Cardinals, Falcons, Giants, and Panthers featured in their upcoming schedule. They beat all four of them, losing only to the Texans and Rams in the next few weeks. None of the wins inspired much confidence, though. The Cardinals outgained the 49ers by 200 yards. Purdy threw three interceptions against the Panthers.</p>

<p>Over the weekend, Donald Trump declared on Truth Social that the airspace around Venezuela should be considered closed. Venezuela’s foreign ministry responded by calling the comments &quot;another extravagant, illegal and unjustified aggression against the Venezuelan people&quot;.
Late last week, Trump also said that land action against alleged drug trafficking networks in the country could start very soon.
All of this is happening amidst a serious military buildup in the Caribbean and escalating threats to remove Venezuela’s president Nicolas Maduro from power.
Is this the buildup to an invasion? And is it really about drugs? Or do Venezuela's massive oil reserves have something to do with it?

<p>CBC News spoke with five paramedics who say they’ve been sent out to respond to 911 calls unnecessarily — either because the call had already been handled by another team and reappeared in the system, or because several ambulances were dispatched to the same call. Urgences-santé, meanwhile, insists there’s been no impact on patient care since the system was implemented.</p>

Carolina’s defense intercepted Stafford twice with Mike Jackson returning one for a 48-yard touchdown and ended the 37-year-old’s NFL record of 28 straight TD passes without an interception.

Stafford completed 18 of 28 passes for 243 yards with two touchdown passes to Davante Adams, his 13th and 14th of the season.</p>

<p>The decision stunned “DD” – an 18-year-old freshman at the University of Alabama named Daniel DiDonato – who learned his map had been selected as he was preparing to leave for his 9.30am introduction to political science class.</p>

      <h1>Expect a tale of two holiday seasons as the well-off spend and the rest pull back | Gene Marks</h1>

      <p>
      <p>Parts of the US economy are doing just fine but many are struggling to make rent, let alone splurging on gifts</p>
<p>Will retailers and merchants have a strong holiday season? That depends. This year, more than most, the 2025 holiday season will actually be two holiday seasons.</p>
<p>If your business caters to higher-income individuals or if you’re located in a wealthier part of the country, you’ll probably have a decent holiday season. True, even the wealthy are cutting back. But according to the HR firm ADP average salaries have risen between 4.5% and 6.7% depending on whether workers stayed or switched jobs. The stock markets, though increasingly volatile, are up over 13% since the beginning of the year. And in <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/rankings/opportunity/economic-opportunity/household-income">some parts of the country</a>, notably New York, Boston, DC and San Francisco, the average household income is over <span class="math inline">\(125,000 - almost \)</span>41,000 higher than the national average. People in this demographic may be a little more cautious but they’ll spend.</p>

<p>The 18-year-old went 13 for 22 from the field in his 20th career game. The top pick in this year’s draft also grabbed eight rebounds. The only other 18-year-old to score 35 points in an NBA game is LeBron James, who did so twice in his rookie season. His first came when he was 18 years and 348 days old, five days older than Flagg was on Saturday.</p>

<p>Marjorie Taylor Greene for president. Randy Bone rolled the idea around in his hands for a second as he stood inside his wife’s antique shop in Ringgold, Georgia. He’s heard the talk.

<p>“I don’t know. I don’t see her as one that is very attractive … You’ve got to focus on those that are kind of in the middle, and I don’t think that she’s unifying enough,” he said.</p>

      <h1>Gutting of key US watchdog could pave way for grave immigration abuses, experts warn</h1>

(date: 2025-11-30)

      <p>Former oversight officials alarmed by dismantling of DHS system that oversees complaints about civil rights harms</p>
<p>The federal watchdog system at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that oversees complaints about civil rights violations, including in immigration detention, has been gutted so thoroughly that it could be laying the groundwork for the Trump administration to “abuse people with impunity”, experts warn.</p>
<p>Former federal oversight officials have sounded the alarm at the rapid dismantling of guardrails against human rights failures – at the same time as the government <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/21/deportations-us-government-shutdown-ice-data">pushes</a> aggressive <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usimmigration">immigration</a> enforcement operations.</p>
<p>Border Patrol agents in Arizona forcibly removed a detained man from a cell, handcuffed him and then injected him with ketamine to sedate him in 2023, according to a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26301388-cbp-ketamine-memo/">CRCL document</a> confirming the watchdog’s investigation into the allegation. A Guardian reporter had saved that document just weeks before it was scrubbed from the DHS’s website.</p>
<p>Guards at a privately owned Louisiana detention center systematically mistreated detained immigrants, according to a CRCL <a href="https://rfkhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/assets/Pepper-spray-Incident-CRCL-Complaint-Winn_3.27.24.pdf">document</a>.This included an investigation into a <a href="https://theappeal.org/biden-admin-extended-contract-abusive-ice-detention-center/">2024 incident</a> during which correctional staff pepper sprayed around 200 detained immigrants who were staging a hunger strike in protest of detention conditions. Guards then allegedly locked the men in the unit and cut the power and water for hours. A majority of the men were allegedly denied medical care, the original <a href="https://rfkhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/assets/Pepper-spray-Incident-CRCL-Complaint-Winn_3.27.24.pdf">complaint</a>, submitted to the CRCL by RFK Human Rights, said.</p>
<p>In a Florida jail, a 33-year-old immigrant woman with mental health problems was forcibly stripped naked, strapped to a restraint chair and mocked by male guards, according to a CRCL <a href="https://www.aclufl.org/app/uploads/2024/11/anas_crcl_final_version.pdf">complaint</a> submitted by the ACLU of Florida and RFK Human Rights. The woman was allegedly left with “contusions and marks on her body” after hours in the restraint chair. The whistleblower declaration said the CRCL had launched an investigation into the case.</p>
<p>Agents violated due process during the arrest and detention of Palestinian student and Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil, according to the whistleblower <a href="https://whistleblower.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/05-15-2025-GovAcctProj-Whistleblower-Disclosures-to-Congress-re-CRCL.pdf">complaint</a>.</p>

(date: 2025-11-30)
      <p>
      <p>From Vietnam to the Balkans, Donald Trump’s family has launched a global dealmaking blitz since his re-election</p>
<p>A crusading prosecutor in the Balkans comes under pressure to drop a big case. Vietnamese villagers learn they are to be evicted. A convicted crypto kingpin in the Gulf receives a pardon.</p>
<p>All have one thing in common: they appear to be connected to the Trump family’s campaign to amass riches around the world. Since Donald Trump’s re-election a year ago, warnings that his use of presidential power to advance personal interests is corroding American democracy have grown ever louder. What is less understood – and perhaps even more dangerous – is the damage this is doing everywhere else.</p>

<p>Hegseth lambasted reports about his role in the strike as “fabricated, inflammatory and derogatory reporting to discredit our incredible warriors fighting to protect the homeland”.</p>

<p>The leading vaccine regulator at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has announced a far stricter course for federal vaccine approvals, following claims from his team that Covid vaccines were linked to the deaths of at least 10 children.</p>
<p>Experts suggest the announcement will make the vaccine approval process significantly more difficult.</p>

<p>U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday said that the airspace &quot;above and surrounding&quot; Venezuela should be considered as &quot;closed in its entirety,&quot; an assertion that raised more questions about the U.S. pressure on Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro. His government accused Trump of making a &quot;colonial threat&quot; and seeking to undermine the South American country's sovereignty.</p>

<p>Northwestern University has agreed to pay $75m to the US government in a deal with the Trump administration to end a series of investigations and restore hundreds of millions of dollars in federal research funding.</p>
<p>Donald Trump’s administration had cut off $790m in grants in a standoff that contributed to university layoffs and the resignation in September of Northwestern’s president, Michael Schill. The administration argued the school had not done enough to fight antisemitism.</p>

      <p>People implicated in the late sex offender’s crimes could face criminal charges or, at the least, social ostracism</p>
<p>As the clock ticks toward the congressionally mandated deadline of 19 December by which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s justice department must release its files related to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a>, there is intense speculation about the contents of these documents – but also questions as to what happens when they are released.</p>
<p>The US president on 19 November signed a bipartisan bill requiring that the US attorney general, Pam Bondi, disclose these documents to the US public within 30 days. Given that other tranches of materials related to the disgraced financier included damning correspondence with high-profile individuals, many expect that still more names of the rich, famous and powerful will be named.</p>

      <p>In the wake of the deadly Washington DC shooting, Trump claimed immigrants are ‘destroying everything America stands for’. Here’s what the data shows</p>
<p>Donald Trump’s hateful, falsehood-filled rant on Thursday blaming immigrants for crime, “social dysfunction” and economic hardship is refuted by a wide range of immigration statistics, which show clearly that immigrants dramatically <a href="https://www.migrationpolicy.org/content/explainer-immigrants-and-us-economy">bolster the US economy</a> and commit crimes at far <a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/curiosity/blog/do-immigrants-get-incarcerated-more">lower rates</a> than people born in the US.</p>
<p>On Thursday evening, Trump condemned immigrants in <a href="https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1994262111145365516">a broad and vicious invective</a>, painting them as “illegal and disruptive populations” and attacking “those that hate, steal, murder and destroy everything that America stands for”. He vowed to block all migration from “third world countries” to allow the “US system to fully recover”.</p>

      <p>Shaped by lockdown and two Trump presidencies, gen Z are grappling with a lot in love, dating and the bedroom</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/the-sex-lives-of-gen-z">The sex lives of gen Z</a> are of great interest – to politicians, to parents, to influencers and dating app executives and to you, apparently. Are gen Z so lonely they are falling in love with AI robots? Are they forming polycules across the US? Are they having enough sex? Are they having sex at all?</p>
<p>Gen Z is defined roughly as young Americans aged 13 to 28. This generation came of age with information about sex readily available to them, for better (the internet provides both sex education and community) and arguably for worse, too (in 2022, 54% of US teens <a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/sites/default/files/research/report/2022-teens-and-pornography-final-web.pdf">reported</a> first seeing online pornography at age 13 or younger). They are more likely to embrace non-traditional identities and are progressive on issues such as abortion rights and same-sex marriage – especially gen Z women.</p>

      <p>Black Friday still brings more shoppers into stores than any other day of the year. For many, it’s the official kick-off to the holiday shopping season. And while Black Friday may be dominated by the Targets and Walmarts of the world, millions of shoppers will go to mom-and-pop retailers on Small Business Saturday. We'll preview this weekend's retail extravaganza. Also, Social Security benefits can act as a financial buoy for the children and spouses of deceased individuals.</p>

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney has struck a deal for a 700-mile pipeline carrying 1 million barrels of oil a day to Canada's West Coast in an attempt to pivot away from reliance on the U.S. economy. The project is likely to face multiple legal challenges, however. Plus, Kenyan farmers have won a case over food sovereignty and a Russian &quot;shadow fleet&quot; is suspected of covertly generating billions for Moscow.</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>Donald Trump has said he will <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/28/trump-says-he-will-permanently-pause-migration-from-third-world-countries-after-national-guard-shooting">“permanently pause migration from all third world countries”</a>, a day after two national guard members were shot in Washington DC in an attack that authorities suspect was carried out by an Afghan national.</p>
<p><strong>What do we know about the other guard member?</strong> Andrew Wolfe, 24, is still fighting for his life, according to the president.</p>
<p><strong>What does Trump mean by</strong> <strong>‘third world</strong> <strong>’?</strong> He did not identify the countries he intended to target or specify what he meant by the phrase.</p>
<p><strong>What has Warren said about Staley?</strong> She said he allegedly protected Epstein’s access to the banking system while working at JP Morgan in the early 2000s.</p>

<p>The Coachella valley typically brings a few things to mind: hot desert sun, the most Instagrammable music festival in the country, and even more sun. What it doesn’t bring to mind, however, is the family-friendly, Mickey Mouse-eared nostalgia associated with all things Disney. But that may be changing.</p>
<p>In 2022, Disney <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/17/disney-california-storyliving-community-rancho-mirage">announced plans to build a first-of-its-kind branded residential community</a>, which they have named “Storyliving by Disney”. The first of the Storyliving communities, Cotino, is officially welcoming residents into model homes in Rancho Mirage, a city nestled in Coachella valley. When all plans are finished, the 618-acre community will feature almost 2,000 residential units, including single-family homes and condos.</p>

<p>From the moment the Fugees shot to fame in the mid-90s, Prakazrel “Pras” Michél was discounted as an incidental member of the hip-hop superstars. He was the unremarkable New Jersey rhyme spitter by way of Brooklyn who was lucky enough to be a high school classmate of the mesmerizing Lauryn Hill and a cousin to mercurial Wyclef Jean. On the group’s breakout album The Score, Michel’s eight-bar features were minor contributions, relative to Hill’s adroitness as an emcee and balladeer and Jean’s compositional polymathy.</p>
<p>“From Hawaii to Hawthorne, I run marathons, like / Buju Banton, I’m a true champion, like / Farrakhan reads his daily Qur’an / It’s a phenomenon, lyrics fast like Ramadan,” Michél raps on the band’s breakout single Fu-Gee-La, in one of his more pedestrian efforts.</p>

      <h1>Amid ‘instability and fear’ in Trump’s economy, Americans are cutting holiday spending</h1>

      <p>
      <p>In addition to rising prices and tariffs, readers cite growing unemployment as a reason not to exchange gifts this year</p>
<p>Americans are feeling rattled about the state of the economy. Donald Trump has <a href="https://x.com/Acyn/status/1986601008714424812">batted away</a> question after question from reporters on concerns over higher prices, just a year after he won an election promising to bring down costs.</p>
<p>While the White House has tried to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/nov/23/affordability-crisis-inflation-costs">reduce concern</a>, floating tariff-funded $2,000 stimulus checks and removing import levies on certain agricultural imports, many consumers remain anxious.</p>

      <h1>AI's role in improving accessibility</h1>

(date: 2025-11-28)
      <p>
      <p>Accessibility has long been aided by the advancement of technology. When it comes to artificial intelligence, accessibility is top of mind for Taylor Arndt, Chief Operations Officer at Techopolis Online Solutions. Arndt has been blind since birth, and so accessibility has been a lifelong battle. When she was in school, she often received physical materials she was unable to read. So, she bought her own hand-held scanner and downloaded a screen reader. At 14, Arndt taught herself to code. Now as a coder working on AI, Arndt says in order for it to help others, the AI models need to be trained on data that has already incorporated accessibility measures.</p>

      <h1>From value-adds to networking superconductor: how the weird language of tech dulled sport | Aaron Timms</h1>

(date: 2025-11-28)
      <p>
      <p>Tech investors promise to disrupt everything from padel to basketball, but their pitch-deck jargon is slowly draining the humanity from sport itself</p>
<p>Finally, a sector more ludicrously hyped than AI. Speaking to Yahoo Sports recently about the launch of Project B, a startup global women’s basketball league, co-founder Grady Burnett <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/wnba/article/project-bs-ambitious-plans-to-reshape-womens-basketball--and-mens-too-154515719.html?guccounter=1">declared</a> that “women’s basketball is growing right now as fast as AI”. Come again? There’s no question that women’s basketball is growing nicely, a development that we should all cheer: this year’s WNBA season <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6723196/2025/10/16/wnba-ratings-viewers-2025-espn/">was the most watched ever</a>. But it is testing credulity to suggest that the sport is growing at anything like the same speed as AI, which since 2022 has gone from the technological margins to the very center of the US economy: by some reports, AI spending <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/how-the-u-s-economy-became-hooked-on-ai-spending-4b6bc7ff?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqfMMCxS4r_ieg846SmpYKXhi83N1_tT61NOcsbRXULw8ktKqwDjOYP2H1wttBw%3D&amp;gaa_ts=69250fa1&amp;gaa_sig=Xrvi-BHzE-4FtB6LgCkDcmZt9F_poOWghzsRHaRyHY7Bwc9pNrLgQZGEA4YxpLdkr7dqDpeqztjVKMWqdgEQ0w%3D%3D">accounted for</a> half of the growth in US GDP in the first half of this year. Perhaps I’m missing the real story here and the Federal Reserve is actively keeping tabs on attendance figures at Washington Mystics v Golden State Valkyries games for signs of potential overheating in the US economy. But it seems unlikely.</p>
<p>Claims like Burnett’s are par for the course in the hyperventilating world of sports investment, in which new leagues intent on world domination are launched seemingly every week and the pitches, delivered at investment conferences by slick men with gleaming teeth and spotless sneakers, grow more and more clammily self-satisfied by the hour. Burnett’s league, which he co-founded with former Skype co-founder Geoff Prentice, was briefly associated with Maverick Carter and LeBron James over the summer but that pair now seems <a href="https://www.thebiglead.com/lebron-james-partner-maverick-carter-reportedly-leaves-5-billion-nba-rival-project/">to have been removed</a> from the picture, and the league is emerging from “stealth mode”, to use a wormy bit of tech jargon, as the pure, uncut essence of bored Silicon Valley rich guy calculation. In a crowded field, Project B may be the most insanely overcaffeinated, tech bro-addled pitch for a new sports league yet.</p>

<p>US regulators say they are taking allegations that top banks may have facilitated Jeffrey Epstein’s criminal activity “very seriously”, as they faced calls to investigate executives including the former Barclays boss Jes Staley.</p>
<p>In correspondence seen by the Guardian, bosses from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) said they <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/28/elizabeth-warren-urges-us-regulators-to-investigate-jes-staley-ties-to-epstein">had reviewed a letter from the Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren</a>, which raised concerns over bankers’ alleged support for the convicted child sex offender Epstein.</p>

<p>Flying drones used during the Ukraine war have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/06/drones-evolving-technology-at-ukraine-conflict-heart">changed land battle tactics</a> for ever. Now the same thing appears to be happening under the sea.</p>
<p>Navies around the world are racing to add autonomous submarines. The UK’s Royal Navy is planning a fleet of underwater uncrewed vehicles (UUVs) which will, for the first time, take a leading role in tracking submarines and protecting undersea cables and pipelines. Australia has committed to spending $1.7bn (£1.3bn) <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/sep/10/ghost-shark-submarine-drone-australian-navy-explainer">on “Ghost Shark” submarines</a> to counter Chinese submarines. The huge US Navy is spending billions on several UUV projects, including one already in use that can be launched from nuclear submarines.</p>

<p>The suspected shooter of two national guard members in Washington DC on Wednesday worked with CIA-backed military units during the US war in Afghanistan, the agency has confirmed.</p>
<p>The alleged gunman, identified as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, 29, came to the US in September 2021 under an Operation Allies Welcome program that gave some Afghans who had worked for the US government entry visas to the US. He was granted asylum in April this year, under the Trump administration, Reuters reported.</p>

      <p>Hey Smarties! Happy Thanksgiving. Today we’re sharing an episode from the latest season of Marketplace’s climate podcast, <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/episode/2025/11/05/the-dry-line">“How We Survive,”</a> that has to do with the future of what’s on your dinner table. As the planet heats up, the climate of the Midwest is changing. It’s pushing the invisible line separating the humid East and arid West eastward which has major implications for our food supply. In this episode, Amy Scott drives across Kansas to find out how farmers are adapting.</p>

<p>A groundbreaking experiment to gauge the potency of Elon Musk’s social platform to increase political division found that when posts expressing anti-democratic attitudes and partisan animosity were boosted, even barely perceptibly, in the feeds of Democrat and Republican supporters there was a large change in their unfavourable feelings towards the other side.</p>

<p>Ontario’s court of appeal has set aside a conviction and ordered a new trial for a man who spent 23 years in prison for the murder of a 10-year-old girl in 1989 — but by all accounts, it’s unlikely that trial will ever happen.</p>

      <h1>Washington DC national guard shooting: what we know so far</h1>

(date: 2025-11-27)
      <p>
      <p>On Wednesday, Rahmanullah Lakanwal shot troop members Sarah Beckstrom and Andrew Wolfe</p>
<p>Two national guard members shot on Wednesday in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/washington-dc">Washington DC</a> are in critical condition. Here’s what we know so far:</p>
<p>At 2.15pm on Wednesday, a man is alleged to have launched what Jeanine Pirro, the US attorney for the District of Columbia, has called an “ambush-style” gun attack two blocks north-west of the White House on two members of the West Virginia national guard.</p>
<p>The guard members – named as Sarah Beckstrom, 20, and Andrew Wolfe, 24, both newly sworn-in – are currently <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/26/national-guard-soldiers-shot-washington-dc">hospitalized in critical condition</a>.</p>
<p>The suspect, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/27/washington-dc-national-guard-shooting-suspect">Rahmanullah Lakanwal</a>, 29, was shot at the scene by a third guard member and is being treated in hospital after being arrested. His wounds are not believed to be life-threatening.</p>
<p>Lakanwal faces charges of assault with intent to kill while armed and possession of a firearm during a crime of violence, though if the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/26/white-house-washington-national-guard">national guard members</a> die, the charges could be upgraded to first-degree murder.</p>
<p>His motives remain unclear: Pirro has said that “it’s too soon to say” and Jeffery Carroll, an executive assistant DC police chief, said that investigators had no information on a motive and the suspect “came around the corner” and immediately started firing at the troops.</p>
<p>He had driven across the US from the home he shares with his wife and five children in Bellingham, Washington state, allegedly to conduct the attack.</p>
<p>He is believed to have acted alone.</p>
<p>Lakanwal worked with the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/27/washington-dc-national-guard-shooting-suspect">CIA in Afghanistan</a>, and came to the US in 2021 as part of a program to resettle Afghans who had aided US operations there. The CIA director, John Ratcliffe, said Lakanwal was “a member of a partner force in Kandahar”.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> has responded to the shooting by ordering 500 more national guard members to Washington, and calling for the reinvestigation of all Afghan refugees who entered under the Biden administration.</p>
<p>US citizenship and immigration services also <a href="https://x.com/USCIS/status/1993882694640415163">said</a> it has stopped processing all immigration requests for Afghan nationals “pending further review of security and vetting protocols”.</p>

      <p>It's been almost three years since ChatGPT went live to the world, and it quickly became a helper or shortcut for students. (Ora tool to cheat.) Like it or not, artificial intelligence is with us. Today, we hear the story of one educator who's trying to prepare her students to use AI responsibly. Plus, professional soccer in Britain has long attracted foreign investment — increasingly from folks Stateside. We'll learn how Americans' involvement is shaping the game.</p>

      <p>Maher Tarabishi was arrested at a routine visit despite decades in the US, leaving his son with Pompe disease</p>
<p>A 62-year-old father named Maher Tarabishi visited the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ice-us-immigration-and-customs-enforcement">ICE</a> field office in Dallas, Texas, on 28 October as he has done each year for 17 years. Tarabishi, originally from Jordan, is in the US on a supervision order. Even though his asylum claim was denied, the US government allowed him to remain in the country because he is the primary caretaker for his son, Wael, who was diagnosed at four years old with a progressive muscle disorder called Pompe disease.</p>
<p>Tarabishi’s mandatory annual visits to ICE were never eventful; he’d arrive, an official might ask about Wael’s condition, and then he would leave. This time was different.</p>

      <h1>Meet the NFL outsiders: the players and coaches not born in the USA</h1>

(date: 2025-11-27)
      <p>
      <p>A few years ago James Cook worked in a Surrey cinema and Max Pircher played in Austria. Now they’re in the NFL</p>
<p>By <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nohelmetsrequiredbook">No Helmets Required</a></p>
<p>The United States is a country of immigrants but the NFL remains dominated by players born in the USA. Only 5% of players are born abroad and the majority of them make the step into the sport by going to college in the US. True outsiders are unusual and foreign coaches are especially rare, which makes James Cook’s story remarkable.</p>
<p>Cook has been in charge of player development at Cleveland Browns for the past six months. That’s an achievement in itself but it’s extraordinary considering he grew up in Surrey, is in his late 20s and never played professional sport. Cook discovered the NFL as a 12-year-old when he was channel-flicking with his dad and came across “this weird and wonderful” sport. He started playing locally and soon wanted to become the first NFL quarterback born in Europe. He got as far as playing for Great Britain but his plans to go to college in the US proved financially prohibitive.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Mark Carney and Alberta Premier Danielle Smith have jointly agreed on a path forward for a new bitumen pipeline to the B.C. coast — a hugely significant development that the federal government is framing as a chance to further develop Alberta's energy sector, diversify Canada's economy and lessen dependence on the U.S.</p>

      <h1>The Super Bowl Shuffle at 40: how a goofy rap classic boosted the Bears’ title run</h1>

(date: 2025-11-27)
      <p>
      <p>A new documentary charts how a song that featured a 335lb rapper and bad dancing went viral in the pre-internet era</p>
<p>The Chicago Bears are 8-3 and soaring in <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/standings">this season’s NFL standings</a>. For a fanbase that’s grown accustomed to looking up at the division rival Green Bay Packers and looking ahead to the next season’s prospects, it’s reason to smell the roses and indulge in some light strutting. But even as fans find themselves looking forward to the Bears’ first playoff berth in five years, something that once seemed unthinkable with a second-year quarterback and a rookie head coaching helming a squad that managed only five wins last year, no fan is thinking the 2025 Bears have a Super Bowl run in them – not without a rap song to lay the marker down.</p>
<p>Before the 1985 edition of the Bears romped to victory in Super Bowl XX, they tempted fate by recording The Super Bowl Shuffle. Although the song only peaked at 41 on the Billboard Hot 100 charts, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooT_uz--O2A&amp;t=3s">the accompanying video</a> came to rival Michael Jackson’s Thriller for popularity as it popped up endlessly on TV during the Bears’ title run. “The Super Bowl Shuffle went viral in an age where there was no viral existence like we know it today,” the song’s recording engineer, Fred Breitberg, says. “It was a phenomenal entity as well as being a good record.”</p>

<p>The scene around Washington’s Farragut Square on Wednesday afternoon seemed to fit Donald Trump’s most lurid stereotypes of a crime-ridden capital in need of federal troops to bring a firm smack of law and order.</p>
<p>An area normally the preserve of professional office workers, coffee shops and lunch venues instead bore the hallmarks of a major crime scene as news spread that two national guard troops had been shot. Authorities <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/26/washington-national-guard-shooting-suspect">later said the shooting suspect had been identified</a> as an Afghan man.</p>

<p>A federal three-judge panel on Wednesday allowed North Carolina to use a redrawn congressional map aimed at flipping a seat to Republicans as part of Donald Trump’s multi-state redistricting campaign ahead of the 2026 elections.</p>
<p>The new map takes aim at North Carolina’s only swing seat, currently held by Democrat Don Davis, an African American who represents more than 20 counties in the state’s north-east. The first district has been represented by Black members of Congress continuously for more than 30 years.</p>

<p>The Trump administration’s ICE raids across southern California have had disastrous effects on the region’s immigrants and swept up US citizens in the process, community leaders and residents said at a congressional hearing in Los Angeles on Monday.</p>
<p>Andrea Velez, an American arrested by US immigration officials over the summer, described how she was accosted by masked agents while on her way to work. She said she was charged with assaulting an officer and held for two days in a federal detention center, where detainees had to pay for a cup in order to have water. The charges against her were ultimately dismissed due to what <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/05/us-citizens-jailed-ice-los-angeles">her attorney described</a> as a lack of evidence.</p>

      <h1>Noem made decision to continue deportation flights to El Salvador, justice department says</h1>

(date: 2025-11-26)
      <p>
      <p>Justice department maintains that Trump administration didn’t violate judge’s order to return flights to US</p>
<p>The Department of Justice said in a statement that Kristi Noem, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, was the one who made the decision to continue with the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/16/deportation-alleged-gang-members-el-salvador">deportation flights</a> of Venezuelan immigrants to El Salvador in March, despite a federal judge’s directive that the flights must be returned to the United States.</p>
<p>In a court <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.278436/gov.uscourts.dcd.278436.195.0.pdf">filing</a> on Tuesday, the justice department said that “Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche and Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove provided DHS with legal advice regarding the court’s order as to flights that had left the United States before the order issued, through DHS Acting General Counsel Joseph Mazzara” and that “after receiving that legal advice, Secretary Noem directed that the AEA detainees who had been removed from the United States before the Court’s order could be transferred to the custody of El Salvador”.</p>

      <h1>A tricky time to be a recent college grad</h1>

(date: 2025-11-26)
      <p>
      <p>New research from the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland finds that earning a college degree can still help you keep a job and get higher wages, but it’s less of an advantage than it used to be. ​The unemployment gap between college graduates and those with just a high school diploma is narrowing. Also: a handful of stocks driving economic growth, a potential trade agreement between the U.S. and Taiwan, and life as a 67-year-old retiree.</p>

      <p>Katie Wilson’s rise from transit campaigner to city hall shows how trust, volunteers and years of organizing overcame big-money politics</p>
<p>While a blue wave was sweeping key races in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york">New York</a> City, Virginia, and New Jersey on 4 November, Seattle progressives were biting their nails down to a quick. At 8pm, only the first round of ballots had been counted in Seattle, and Katie Wilson, a longtime community organizer and the progressive challenger in the mayoral race, was behind by seven points.</p>
<p>But it was far from over. Because Washington tate votes almost entirely by mail, that first ballot count was less than a quarter of the vote. As the week wore on, and progressives’ fingernails disappeared, Wilson’s share of the vote crept up, slowly but steadily. Eight days after the election, Seattle declared that Wilson would be the next mayor of Seattle.</p>

<p>Bloomberg’s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-25/witkoff-advised-russia-on-how-to-pitch-ukraine-plan-to-trump">scoop</a> showing how Trump aide Steve Witkoff coached the Kremlin on the best way to get into Trump’s good graces is extraordinary for what it tells us about Witkoff’s dubious loyalties and the Kremlin’s potential influence over US negotiation efforts. But equally interesting is the leaked material itself and where it may have come from.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/25/trump-envoy-on-russia-ukraine-peace-deal">story covers two intercepted phone calls</a>: one between Witkoff and top Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov, and another between Ushakov and Kirill Dmitriev, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/21/who-is-kirill-dmitriev-draft-plan-ukraine-war-russia">who has been deeply involved in negotiations</a> with the Trump White House.</p>

<p>Stranger Things fans will finally get some answers when Season 5 drops today — but that's not stopping them from speculating about who might die or how the show’s villains might be defeated. They say whether they’re right or wrong, it's fun to predict how the beloved series will come to a close.</p>

      <p>Witkoff also offered tactical guidance on how Putin should raise subject with Trump, audio recording suggests. Plus, the female pilots on Ukraine’s frontline</p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>Donald Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, told a senior Kremlin official last month that achieving peace in Ukraine <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/25/trump-envoy-on-russia-ukraine-peace-deal">would require Russia gaining control of Donetsk</a> and potentially a separate territorial exchange, according to a recording of their conversation.</p>
<p><strong>What did Witkoff say?</strong> “Now, me to you, I know what it’s going to take to get a peace deal done: Donetsk and maybe a land swap somewhere,” Witkoff told Ushakov during the five-minute conversation, according to a transcript of the recording obtained by Bloomberg. “But I’m saying instead of talking like that, let’s talk more hopefully because I think we’re going to get to a deal here.”</p>

<p><strong>What has changed?</strong> It marks a sharp departure from Donald Trump’s narrative to the public every time he has discussed the 21 strikes that have killed more than 80 people, which he has portrayed as an effort to stop overdose deaths.</p>
<p><strong>What have the White House said?</strong> A White House official responded that Trump had not been making a legal argument. Still, the president’s remarks remain the only public reason for why the US is firing missiles – when the legal justification is in fact very different.</p>

<p>White nationalist and rightwing agitators recently descended on Dearborn, Michigan, to hold an anti-Islam rally at which they attempted to burn a Qur’an and manufacture controversy over the city’s large Arab-American population. But the protest has been dismissed by local leaders as a cheap publicity stunt aimed at generating money and clicks for far-right influencers.</p>
<p>But there is little doubt the Michigan city has become a repeated target for the publicity-hungry far-right because it holds the US’s highest percentage of Arab-American residents. Similar provocateurs have <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2015/03/03/christian-evangelists-free-speech-dearborn-court-case/24347331/">marched with a pig’s head</a> on a pole at an Arab-American fair.

<p>This time last season, Liverpool had just registered their 10th win in 12 games to go nine points clear at the top of the Premier League. It was around this time the narrative around Slot’s team shifted from questioning if they could win the title in their first season post-Jürgen Klopp to predicting just how far ahead of the chasing pack they would finish. A year on, the narrative has shifted tremendously.</p>

(date: 2025-11-26)
      <p>
      <p>Democratic lawmakers who appeared in a social media video urging U.S. troops to defy “illegal orders” say the FBI has contacted them to begin scheduling interviews. It comes a day after the Pentagon announced it is investigating Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona over potential violations of military law. Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin told reporters Tuesday that Trump “is attempting to use the FBI to scare us.” The inquiries mark an extraordinary escalation for federal law enforcement and military institutions that traditionally steer clear of partisan clashes.</p>

<p>US district judge Sunshine Sykes in Riverside, California, certified a nationwide class of individuals who were already living in the United States when they were detained and are legally entitled to a hearing to determine whether they can be released on bond while their deportation cases proceed.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> is framing its boat strikes against drug cartels in the Caribbean in part as a collective self-defense effort on behalf of US allies in the region, according to three people directly familiar with the administration’s internal legal argument.</p>
<p>The legal analysis rests on a premise – for which there is no immediate public evidence – that the cartels are waging armed violence against the security forces of allies like Mexico, and that the violence is financed by cocaine shipments.</p>

      <p>“Affordability” — it’s a hot-button issue across the political spectrum. But how does one define or quantify a subjective idea? We called up a linguist and a few economists to hear their thoughts. Plus: Flat wholesale inflation is a warning sign for higher overall inflation, September retail sales merely inched up, and the U.S. dollar is showing signs of recovery after a troubling first half of the year.</p>

<p>Don’t give up the day job. On Tuesday, Donald Trump came to the <a href="https://www.c-span.org/liveEvent/?thanksgiving">annual Thanksgiving turkey pardoning</a> ceremony at the White House ready to serve up some political satire. It went about as well as you would expect.</p>
<p>Like a startled turkey flapping in zigzags, the US president’s speech ricocheted bafflingly from topic to topic. He told jokes in the worst possible taste and watched them arc through the Rose Garden sky before landing with a thud. And on a day intended for charity and good cheer, he described a state governor as “a big, fat slob”.</p>

<p>The lawsuit was filed last Thursday in Wayne county circuit court in Michigan by Robert Garza, who had joined Campbell’s New Jersey headquarters remotely in September 2024 as a security analyst. Garza alleges he was fired in January after he raised concerns about comments made by Martin Bally, Campbell’s vice-president of information technology – including referring to one of the company’s ingredients as “bioengineered meat” while going off on a racist tirade.</p>

      <p>National spotlight, after video of violent fight went viral, has led residents to question just how safe their city is or isn’t – and who is responsible for sparking the debate</p>
<p>It took only a few days for footage of a violent brawl in downtown Cincinnati in July to catch the attention of some of the country’s most high-profile figures.</p>
<p>The fight, which saw a white woman punched in the face from behind by an African American man, among other incidents, took place when around 150,000 people were attending events in the city’s urban core.</p>

<p>San Francisco receiver Jauan Jennings said he threw a punch at Tre’Von Moehrig at the end of Monday night’s game after a “cheap shot” from the Carolina safety.</p>
<p>Television cameras caught Moehrig <a href="https://x.com/Jordan_Woodson/status/1993169475777282291">delivering a punch to Jennings’ groin</a> late in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/nov/24/49ers-panthers-monday-night-football">49ers’ 20-9 victory</a>. Jennings did not immediately retaliate but once the game was over he approached Moehrig and hit him in the helmet before giving him a shove. Jennings then needed to be held back as the teams left the field.</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>A federal judge <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/24/james-comey-letitia-james-charges-case-dismissed">threw out the criminal cases against James Comey and Letitia James</a> yesterday, concluding that the prosecutor handling the cases was unlawfully appointed.</p>
<p><strong>What did the judge say?</strong> “I conclude that the attorney general’s attempt to install Ms Halligan as interim US attorney for the eastern district of Virginia was invalid and that Ms Halligan has been unlawfully serving in that role since 22 September 2025,” wrote Currie, who was appointed to the bench by Bill Clinton.</p>
<p><strong>When did the talks begin?</strong> Reports emerged that a fresh round of US-brokered peace talks had begun last night in the capital of the United Arab Emirates, with Dan Driscoll, the US army secretary, flying in to meet a Russian delegation and a Ukrainian team led by Kyrylo Budanov.</p>

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> The world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, and its founder, Changpeng Zhao, are being sued by victims and family members of victims in the October 2023 attack in Israel. They're accusing Binance of knowingly enabling terrorist groups like Hamas to move more than $1 billion through its platform. Also: a slowdown at Serbia's Russian-owned oil refinery, growing risks to European undersea cables, and rerouted flights after an Ethiopian volcano eruption.</p>

The suspensions would take effect on 1 January, and because the list is not finalized, the school’s have not yet been informed.</p>

<p>The president was online early today, and fired off a Truth Social post at 5:38am touting the economic impact that his sweeping tariffs will soon have on the country. He also noted that countries’ efforts to stockpile US goods ahead of the levies kicking in was “wearing thin”.</p>
<p>“These payments will be RECORD SETTING, and put our Nation on a new and unprecedented course,” he wrote. “This Tariff POWER will bring America National Security and Wealth the likes of which has never been seen before.”</p>
<p>Those opposing us are serving hostile foreign interests that are not aligned with the success, safety and prosperity of the USA. They couldn’t care less about us. I look so much forward to the United States Supreme Court’s decision on this urgent and time sensitive matter,” he added.</p>

(date: 2025-11-24)
      <p>
      <p>The delayed-by-the-shutdown September jobs report showed a stronger-than-expected monthly gain of 119,000 jobs, seasonally adjusted. But dig into the data, and signs point to many of those jobs being second or third jobs. In this episode, more people are working multiple gigs to get by. Plus: China’s got a different AI investment approach than the U.S., the housing market got a boost in October, and your online return probably ended up on the secondary market.</p>

<p>The justice department has renewed its request to unseal grand jury materials from the Jeffrey Epstein investigation that led to the disgraced financier’s federal indictment on sex-trafficking charges in 2019.</p>
<p>The submission, signed by US attorney Jay Clayton for the southern district in New York, says that Congress made clear in approving the release of investigative materials last week that the court records should be released.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> announced it will cancel temporary asylum for about 10,000 Myanmar nationals living in the US, despite the country being ruled by a military dictatorship that has a record of executing dissidents.</p>
<p>On Monday the Department of Homeland Security said it was terminating the designation of Burma (Myanmar) for Temporary Protected Status relief. It claimed that after reviewing conditions in Myanmar and consulting with appropriate US government agencies, “the secretary [Kristi Noem] determined that Burma no longer continues to meet the conditions” for TPS designation.</p>

      <p>President’s comment implies hostility to Venezuela may be based on unfounded election-rigging conspiracy theory</p>
<p>Donald Trump on Sunday appeared to endorse the discredited conspiracy theory that Venezuela’s leadership controls electronic voting software worldwide and caused his 2020 election defeat to Joe Biden.</p>
<p>White House officials have previously said that Trump’s increasingly bellicose policy toward Venezuela is driven by concerns about migration and the drug trade. But the president’s new comment, made on <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115600167812342707">Truth Social</a>, hints that his hostility to Venezuela may also be based on an outlandish, implausible theory ruled to be false by a judge in 2023.</p>

<p>Authorities in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california">California</a> are searching for the body of a man who was swept into the ocean at a beach in the Big Sur area, one week after a girl and her father died after being pulled into the water in the same state park.</p>
<p>Three people were pulled into the water from the rocks at the Soberanes Point area of Garrapata state park on Saturday afternoon just after 3pm and began yelling for help, according to a statement from the Monterey county sheriff’s office. Two women who had been dragged into the ocean were able to pull themselves out of the water.</p>

      <p>The U.S. economy is often buoyed by consumer spending. In China, however, consumer spending is a much smaller part of economic output. And while the government there tries to stimulate spending, young people there are grappling with high unemployment and stalling wage growth. Plus, we'll discuss expectations for inflation and economic growth, as well as consumer shopping figures for this upcoming Black Friday.</p>

      <h1>What is the latest Black Friday boycott – and will it work?</h1>

      <p>While others scramble for deals on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, activists hope to leverage shopping behavior for societal change</p>

</ul>
<p>Building on the momentum of consumer boycotts against Target and other companies earlier this year, grassroots organizers want American consumers to use their economic power this <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/thanksgiving">Thanksgiving</a> weekend to protest the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a>’s anti-immigration and anti-DEI crackdowns – and the big corporations that won’t oppose them.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://indivisible.org/campaign/we-aint-buying-it">We Ain’t Buying It</a> campaign – organized by many of the groups behind the No Kings protests – is asking Americans to stop shopping at Target, Home Depot and Amazon on Black Friday, one of the busiest retail days of the year, while also encouraging people to shop local and support community businesses.</p>

<p>So it turns out those who had already handed the title to Arsenal were right after all.</p>
<p>It’s absurd, of course, to start handing out the title in November but a feature of modern football is how obsessed it becomes so early with title races. It’s perhaps a legacy of the Pep Guardiola-Jürgen Klopp rivalry’s peak, when being champion meant amassing more than 95 points. It made sense then to scan the track far ahead for any potential hurdles because there were so few. But less than a third of the way through this season, Manchester City, who remain probably the biggest danger to Arsenal, have already dropped as many points as they did in the entirety of 2017-18, their 100-point campaign.</p>

<p>The Wisconsin woman who admitted to repeatedly stabbing a sixth-grade classmate to delight the fictional online horror character Slender Man in 2014 has been caught after authorities said she cut off a monitoring bracelet and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/23/wisconsin-woman-missing-slender-man-stabbing">left her group home</a>.</p>
<p>Morgan Geyser, 23, was found in Posen, Illinois, on Sunday evening, authorities said. Police in Madison, Wisconsin, had issued an alert for Geyser earlier in the day, saying she had last been seen with an adult acquaintance on Saturday evening.</p>

(date: 2025-11-24)
      <p>
      <p>Americans don’t often have a direct say in how their tax dollars get spent; those decisions are generally left to elected officials. But some places have engaged in “participatory budgeting,” where residents propose projects, then vote on which ones get public funding. Today, we head to Nashville to learn how the process played out. But first: economics at the center of G20 discussions and what Thanksgiving travel plans are looking like.</p>

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> A gathering in South Africa of major economies has ended with a joint declaration committing to &quot;multilateral cooperation.&quot; We'll hear more. Plus, India and Canada have agreed to resume discussions on a bilateral trade deal, a three-day national strike is getting underway in Belgium, and the Chinese government is urging young people to spend more to boost the economy — but that’s proving difficult at a time of record youth unemployment.</p>

(date: 2025-11-24)
      <p>
      <p>Disqualifications of Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri bring unnecessary stress for McLaren in the final two F1 races of the season</p>
<p>As misjudgments go, McLaren’s error in calculations that led <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/nov/23/max-verstappen-wins-f1-las-vegas-gp-lando-norris-second">to the disqualification of Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri</a> from the Las Vegas Grand Prix on Sunday could barely have been more cataclysmic nor more poorly timed. Quite how they got it wrong just when they wanted to close out the drivers’ championship with as little fuss as possible will take no little explanation.</p>
<p>Norris and Piastri, second and fourth respectively to Max Verstappen’s win in Nevada, had been solid enough results until the FIA discovered the skid blocks on their cars had been worn beyond the 9mm limit. In one fell swoop, Verstappen was right back in the fight, alongside Piastri, 24 points back from Norris.</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>Senator Mark Kelly yesterday urged congressional Republicans to publicly reject Trump’s threats against him and five other Democratic lawmakers who have said that military personnel are not obliged to follow illegal commands.</p>
<p><strong>What did Kelly say?</strong> “His words carry tremendous weight, more so than anybody else in the country, and he should be aware of that, and because of what he says, there is now increased threats against us,” Kelly said of Trump’s accusations.</p>
<p><strong>What does the original plan say?</strong> The original <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/20/us-russia-reportedly-draft-plan-end-ukraine-war-zelenskyy">28-point US document</a> leaked last week demanded that Ukraine should hand over territory to Russia, limit the size of its army and agree not to pursue the Kremlin for alleged war crimes.</p>

      <p>Exodus of lawyers under Trump weakens department’s capacity in civil rights, national security and other areas</p>
<p>Donald Trump’s weaponization of the US department of justice to focus on retribution against political foes, on fulfilling Maga goals and on granting pardons for allies has seen thousands of lawyers depart or be fired and weakened investigations in civil rights, national security and other areas, say ex-prosecutors and legal experts.</p>
<p>Data compiled by the nonpartisan Justice Connection showed that overall DoJ employment has dropped by about 5,500 lawyers and non-lawyers who have left since Trump took office. That included people who were fired, quit or took a deferred resignation program, underscoring a sharp drop in DoJ resources. By contrast, the department last year employed about 10,000 attorneys, according to DoJ data.</p>

      <h1>Doctors respond to ‘data-free’ decision over menopause hormone therapy: ‘It’s not true’</h1>

(date: 2025-11-24)
      <p>
      <p>Physicians say FDA panel conflated two issues and made baseless claims about unproven health benefits</p>
<p>Estrogen-related medications for menopause will no longer carry broad black-box warnings, Marty Makary, commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), announced last week, bypassing the regulatory agency’s typical process and, according to experts, overstating the science behind the medications – with troubling implications for future drug decisions.</p>
<p>The decision to remove an ominous warning from 2003 about the risks of cardiovascular disease, breast cancer and dementia makes sense for local vaginal estrogen products, but systemic estrogen is more complicated, menopause experts said – and more than these nuances, they worried about the scientific process, or lack thereof, in making the decision.</p>

      <p>Expecting to be financial advisers at the Fortune 500 firm, some hires say they were ‘gaslit’ into peddling ‘terrible’ life insurance to all their contacts</p>
<p>Northwestern Mutual likes to think of itself as a storied American institution offering specialized financial advice. The 168-year-old financial giant, ranked 109 on the Fortune 500, and regularly anointed one of the World’s Most Admired Companies by the magazine, <a href="https://www.northwesternmutual.com/who-we-are/">describes</a> its financial advisers as “expert listeners” or a “trusted partner who helps you continue to reach goal after goal”.</p>
<p>It also tops Forbes’s list of Best Employers for New Grads, a title that makes it attractive to hundreds of college students desperate for an internship that could launch them into a career in financial services. Each year they file into Northwestern’s glassy offices across the country for a three-month internship that they hope could change their lives. There, they are slotted in beside thousands of full-time “financial representatives”, many of them recent graduates themselves.</p>

(date: 2025-11-24)
      <p>
      <p>Dr. Carlos Chaccour, physician scientist at the University of Navarra, noticed something fishy about a letter to the editor the New England Journal of Medicine received shortly after it published a paper of his on malaria treatment in July.</p>
<p>The letter was riddled with strange errors such as critiques supposedly based on other research Chaccour himself had written. So he and his co-author Matthew Rudd decided to dig deeper.</p>
<p>They analyzed patterns of letters to the editor over the last decade and found a remarkable increase in what they call &quot;prolific debutantes&quot; — new authors who suddenly had dozens, even hundreds of letters published, starting right around the time OpenAI’s ChatGPT came out.</p>
<p>Why would academics want to do this? Marketplace’s Meghan McCarty Carino spoke with Chaccour to find out.</p>

      <p>
      <p>The most successful quarterback of all-time approached his playing career with ruthless focus. He could do with the same intensity in his retirement projects</p>
<p>Tom Brady played for 23 NFL seasons with a single, maniacal goal: to become the greatest quarterback who ever lived. He achieved it. Now, in retirement, Brady has dabbled in everything. He <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/18/tom-bradys-raiders-coaching-booth-fox">calls games for Fox</a>. He’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/nov/20/birmingham-city-unveil-62000-capacity-stadium-plans-12-chimney-towers">building chimneys in Birmingham</a>. He’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/mar/27/where-did-ftx-money-go">flogged crypto</a>. He’s spreading <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/15/nfl-tom-brady-flag-football-saudi-arabia-olympics">America’s Game to Riyadh</a>. He has a thriving YouTube account. He <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/nov/04/tom-brady-dog-clone-colossal-biotech-viagen">cloned his dog</a>. Brady’s post-playing portfolio has been diverse, or aimless, depending on your perspective.</p>
<p>Side hustles are one thing. But running a pro franchise is not a part-time job. Along with his other roles, Brady is also the de facto football czar of the Raiders, the most hapless team in the league.</p>

<p>When an Ontario woman made a $4,300 hotel reservation on Booking.com, she never expected the website would cancel it, then offer her the same accommodations for quadruple the price.

<p>At a press conference last week U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi laid out fresh allegations against Ryan Wedding, a 44-year-old Canadian and former Olympian who has been on the FBI’s most wanted list since March.
Wedding is already accused of orchestrating multiple murders, and these new charges add to the drug and conspiracy allegations he’s facing.
We speak to Calvi Leon, a reporter at the Toronto Star who’s been covering this case extensively.

<p>Advocates say the Manitoba government's plan to detain people intoxicated with long-lasting drugs like methamphetamine at a Winnipeg detox facility for up to 72 hours could put marginalized people at greater risk.</p>

<p>The “department of government efficiency” (Doge) has apparently been dissolved with eight months still remaining on its contract, ending a drawn-out campaign of invading federal agencies and firing thousands of federal workers.</p>
<p>“That doesn’t exist,” office of personnel management (OPM) director Scott Kupor told Reuters earlier this month when asked about Doge’s status, adding that it was no longer a “centralized entity”.</p>

<p>So when gun violence came for longtime Oakland football coach John Beam, whose mentorship had changed the lives of generations of students, the devastation reverberated around the city.</p>

<p>Chkhikvishvili appeared in a Brooklyn court last week as one might find an office IT tech: close-cropped hair and black-rimmed glasses, attentive, clear-spoken and cooperative as he was questioned about his understanding of a plea that could see him imprisoned for up to 18 years at his March sentencing.</p>

      <h1>They’re doing to America what they did to Christianity | Bill McKibben</h1>

(date: 2025-11-23)
      <p>
      <p>Trump’s wrecking-ball approach to America has a precedent: the Maga evangelical perversion of Jesus’s message of radical love to one of hate and aggression</p>
<p>Trumpism’s most revealing and defining moments – not its most important, nor cruelest, nor most dangerous, nor stupidest, but perhaps its most illuminating – came earlier this autumn. In the course of a few weeks, the US president started showing everyone his plans for a gilded ballroom twice the size of the White House and then began unilaterally ripping down the East Wing to build it. Then, after nationwide protests against his rule, he posted on social media an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/20/trump-ai-video-no-kings">AI video</a> of himself wearing a crown and piloting a fighter jet labeled “King Trump”, which proceeded to bomb American cities and Americans with a graphically vivid load of human poop.</p>
<p>He has done things 10,000 times as bad – the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-documentary/the-shutdown-of-usaid-has-already-killed-hundreds-of-thousands">current estimate</a> of deaths from his cuts to USAID is 600,000 and rising, and this week a <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-climate-rollbacks-heat-deaths">study</a> predicted his fossil fuel policies would kill another 1.3 million. But nothing as definitional. No other president would have dared – really, no other president would have imagined – unilaterally destroying large sections of the White House in order to erect a Versailles-style party room, with the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/23/trump-white-house-ballroom-donors">active collaboration</a> of some of the richest Americans, almost all of whom have business with the government. And no one – not Richard Nixon, not Andrew Jackson, not Warren Harding, not anyone – would have imagined boasting about defecating on the American citizenry. Even the worst American leaders were willing to maintain the notion that they represented all the people; Trump has managed to turn America’s idea of itself entirely upside down. And he has done it with the active consent of an entire political party. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, when asked about the poop video, for once did not bother lying that he had not seen it. Instead he said: “The president uses social media to make the point. You can argue he’s probably the most effective person who’s ever used social media.”</p>

      <h1>‘Eating Indigenously’: award-winning chef celebrates Native American cuisine in new cookbook</h1>

(date: 2025-11-23)
      <p>
      <p>James Beard-winning chef Sean Sherman’s cookbook Turtle Island pushes readers to view food systems through an Indigenous lens</p>
<p>As a child growing up on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota in the 1970s and 80s, Sean Sherman, an Oglala Lakota member and a James Beard award-winning chef, recalls pounding dried bison and mixing it with chokeberry to create a snack called wasná. He and his cousins would often hunt for pheasants and grouse, or harvest wild berries and Thíŋpsiŋla, a wild prairie turnip that’s a staple Lakota food. Sherman’s earliest memories of food were full of history, culture and spiritualism.</p>
<p>His idealistic experiences of harvesting and hunting for food on the reservation were juxtaposed with the legacy of colonialism. Most of the time, Sherman and his family ate government-issued food such as canned beef, or blocks of cow cheese, which diverged from their traditional diet. It’s a tale that Sherman, co-founder of the Minneapolis-based Indigenous restaurant <a href="https://owamni.com/">Owamni</a>, shares along with other stories in a new cookbook that highlights Indigenous cuisines throughout North America.</p>

      <p>The costs of groceries, housing, childcare, education and healthcare have become intolerable to many</p>

Under <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>, she worries it may get even harder. “With this administration, it doesn’t appear to be stabilising,” she adds. “It’s hard to think about how exactly we are going to ride this out.”</p>

      <p>The army secretary has little in his résumé to suggest he can end the war between Russia and Ukraine</p>
<p>Little in Dan Driscoll’s résumé – past or present – suggests he has the qualifications to understand the often-tortured and bloody history of relations between <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia">Russia</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a>.</p>
<p>A former investment banker with a degree in business administration, the current US army secretary’s main calling card for a prominent role in the Trump administration may be a friendship with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jd-vance">JD Vance</a> dating from when they were at Yale Law School together.</p>

<p>One morning in October, Donna DesRuisseaux headed to a local bridge near her home in Goffstown, New Hampshire, armed with a sign that said: “Honk for democracy.” The 62-year-old business manager was taking part in a new tradition of protesting on various bridges and overpasses throughout the state.</p>
<p>“I’m very worried about our democracy, freedom of speech, social security and health insurance,” said DesRuisseaux, who attended a No Kings protest in Manchester, New Hampshire, later that day, where she ran into some of her “bridge friends”. DesRuisseaux had never protested anything prior to 2025, in part because she was a busy working mom. But after discovering the <a href="https://www.nhbbd.org">NH Bridge Brigade for Democracy</a> group on Facebook, she knew she had to do something to express her outrage.</p>

      <h1>China has brought millions out of poverty. The US has not – by choice</h1>

(date: 2025-11-23)
      <p>
      <p>Despite the US’s economic success, income inequality remains breathtaking. But this is no glitch – it’s the system</p>
<p>The Chinese did rather well in the age of globalization. In 1990, 943 million people there lived on less than <span class="math inline">\(3 a day measured in 2021 dollars – 83% of the population, according to the World Bank. By 2019, the [number was brought down to zero](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.DDAY?locations=CN). Unfortunately, the United States was [not as successful](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.DDAY?locations=US). More than 4 million Americans – 1.25% of the population – must make ends meet with less than \)</span>3 a day, more than three times as many as 35 years ago.</p>
<p>The data is not super consistent with the narrative of the US’s inexorable success. Sure, American productivity has zoomed ahead of that of its European peers. Only a handful of countries manage to produce more stuff per hour of work. And artificial intelligence now promises to put the United States that much further ahead.</p>

<p>With trade uncertainty, tariffs and rising prices, Canadian shoppers are expected to pull back this holiday season. Retailers are offering weeks-long discounts —and for some, their first Black Friday deals ever — in the hope of enticing people to spend.</p>

<p>As Canada starts to diversify its ties with other countries amidst an increasingly unpredictable and unreliable relationship with the U.S., its pivot toward China, in particular, will need to be strategic: the work must be done while balancing the risks and strengthening the country internally.</p>

<p>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, first released 125 years ago, is a seemingly simple story of friendship, self reliance and longing for home continues to speak to us. But another theme shimmers a bit deeper below the surface: feminism, in a world powered by its women, witches and queens.</p>

<p>Laws about greenwashing — making a false or misleading statement about the environmental benefits of a product — will remain on the books, but the Liberal government has said it will be making changes aimed at offering businesses more certainty about what runs afoul of the law.</p>

      <p>Federal appeals court declines to put hold on lower court’s finding that administration violated migrants’ due process</p>
<p>A federal appeals court on Saturday declined to clear the way for Donald Trump’s administration to expand a fast-track deportation process to allow for the expedited removal of immigrants who are living far away from the border.</p>
<p>A 2-1 panel of the US court of appeals for the District of Columbia circuit declined to put on hold the central part of a ruling by a lower-court judge who had found that the administration’s policies violated the due process rights of immigrants who could be apprehended anywhere in the US.</p>
