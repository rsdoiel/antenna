(date: 2025-10-08)
      <p>
      <p>Just two months ago, the World Trade Organization predicted global trade would grow by nearly 2% next year. Now, it’s revised that forecast down to just 0.5% as the impact of the Trump administration’s sweeping tariffs sinks in. We'll hear what's been propping up trade so far and what's on the road ahead. Then, &quot;Marketplace Tech&quot; shares tips for spotting job scams. And later, we'll hear how other countries' &quot;gold card&quot; visa programs fared.</p>

      <h1>Using tariffs to help farmers ... harmed by tariffs</h1>

(date: 2025-10-08)
      <p>
      <p>When President Donald Trump slapped tariffs on Chinese goods earlier this year, China ceased crop purchases from U.S. farmers. That hurt American agriculture, so the government hopes to help those farmers out with aid using tariff revenue. Trump did this during his last trade war. Today, we'll outline how it all played out. Plus, the price of gold keeps climbing, and we check in with a tea shop owner about how tariffs are affecting business.</p>

(date: 2025-10-08)
      <p>
      <p>AI slop is pointless content shared online like fake images and videos. A new study in the Harvard Business Review wants us to consider a variant: “workslop,” or AI-generated reports, emails and more that are sloppily crafted.</p>
<p>The authors of the study say 40% of workers they surveyed have encountered workslop. And that's costing time and money.</p>
<p>Marketplace’s Nova Safo spoke with social psychologist and vice president of BetterUp Labs Kate Niederhoffer, who co-authored the study. She said workslop harms interpersonal work relationships, such as when one employee receives an AI written report from another.</p>

(date: 2025-10-07)
      <p>
      <p>The federal government shutdown drags on this week, leaving a labor data vacuum. Private firms are hoping to fill the gap with their own data sets — some are even offering ‘em for free. Unfortunately, that private data is narrower and less comprehensive than typical BLS reports. Also in this episode: The popularity of all-cash home sales, the unique risks and boons AI presents for Indian Country, and the vital role of equipment auctions for small contractors.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Health care is a major sticking point between Republicans and Democrats in the government shutdown standoff. Congressional Democrats are refusing to endorse a temporary spending bill that allows Affordable Care Act health insurance subsidies to expire. Today, we look at what an end to subsidies could mean for your insurance — even if you don't get your health care through the ACA. Also: trade talks between the U.S. and Canada, and a comparison of the AI boom and the dot-com bubble.</p>

      <p>The number of scams involving job postings and offers nearly tripled between 2020 and 2024, according to the Federal Trade Commission. The change translates to more than $500 million in reported losses.</p>
<p>These scams have proliferated on legitimate job boards and you might have even received some via email or text message — fake recruiters reach out with “enticing” offers which are too good to be true.

      <p>The gap between how high-income and low-income Americans are faring in this economy is growing. One example? Fast food restaurants are struggling while sit-down joints that cater to wealthier customers are A-OK. Also in this episode: “Every Screen on the Planet” author Emily Baker-White talks geopolitics behind the U.S.-China TikTok deal and a Wyoming solar panel company preps for the end of federal subsidies for residential installation.</p>

      <p>Federal worker layoffs are near, according to Trump administration officials. Earlier this week, the president said he would use the government shutdown to target &quot;Democrat things.&quot; And a shutdown with layoffs may have more serious economic consequences than your average shutdown. For more on that we turn to Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG. Also on today's show: China launches a new visa to attract more international STEM talent.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Unemployment remains relatively low, but the labor market is slowing down. Private payroll company ADP estimates the private sector lost 32,000 jobs last month. Hiring has slowed, and it's taking longer for jobseekers to find work. And where there are people with anxiety and fear, there are scammers to prey on them. The Federal Trade Commission says reports of job scams tripled over the past four years. But first, why the Trump administration is sending memos to universities and what Democrats are demanding to reopen the government.</p>

Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, a self-described “data dog,” tells us how central bank officials plan to pivot. He also discusses Fed independence, transitory inflation, and rate cut pacing. After that: fiscal calendars vary by sector, synthetic dye removal will ripple through the food chain, and ADP reports more sour employment data.</p>

(date: 2025-10-01)
      <p>
      <p>The Supreme Court has temporarily blocked President Trump's attempt to fire Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook, a move that critics say would have compromised the central bank's independence</p>

      <h1>How the government shutdown will affect federal workers</h1>

(date: 2025-10-01)
      <p>
      <p>The slow-moving train wreck we've been watching unfold for a week, has indeed wrecked: the government officially shutdown at midnight. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers will be furloughed, and the Trump administration is threatening to fire others. Later in the show, Marketplace's Sabri Ben-Achour sits down with Susan M. Collins, president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. They'll discuss tariffs, a cooling labor market and how the central bank is affected by a government shutdown.</p>

      <p>
      <p>The role of artificial intelligence in mental health care is an unsettled issue. States including Illinois, Utah, and Nevada limit or ban the use of AI for therapy. And researchers say such conversations can sometimes veer off course and even be dangerous.</p>

(date: 2025-09-30)
      <p>
      <p>While the stock market appears unconcerned about potential red flags in this economy, the bond market's a bit more cautious. As Washington nears a shutdown and the labor market flags, Treasury yields are ticking down. But demand for those safer, long-term bonds hasn’t been uniform. Plus: Trump adds to existing tariffs on Canadian lumber, OpenAI wades into e-commerce waters, and Abha Bhattarai at the Washington Post talks about the “stuck economy.”</p>

(date: 2025-09-30)
      <p>
      <p>The Trump administration’s new $100,000 fee on new H-1B visas for foreign workers threatens to upend hiring in tech. But the fee goes far beyond just that industry. Higher education also uses the H-1B visa, and that fee could be a big problem there. Brendan Cantwell, a professor at Michigan State University, unpacks what these changes mean for universities. But first, Dr. David Kelly, chief global strategist at J.P. Morgan Funds joins us to discuss President Trump's latest tariffs.</p>

Overall, though, the market remains sluggish — owners don't want to give up their locked-in low rates and buyers are waiting to see if rates and other costs will cool. Also in this episode: Banks respond to the Fed rate cut, retailers prepare for holiday hiring, and tech companies hope nuclear is the answer to data center energy demand.</p>

      <h1>Consumer spending outpaced income — again</h1>

(date: 2025-09-26)
      <p>
      <p>In August, Americans spent more than they made for the third month in a row. Thanks to tariff-induced price bumps, consumers are dipping into savings and using credit cards to keep up with their typical spending. In this episode, how long can consumers stay resilient? Plus: LA businesses prepare for ongoing ICE raids, a ski group vies to manage U.S. surfing at the 2028 Olympics, and an artist’s work changes in the age of e-commerce.</p>

      <p>President Trump has ordered steep new tariffs on imported drugs, home furnishings, and trucks. The president's import taxes are pushing inflation higher. But that's not slowing consumer spending.</p>

      <p>
      <p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order yesterday that paves the way for TikTok to be controlled by U.S. interests, avoiding a Congressional ban. TikTok's owner, ByteDance, has not acknowledged that this transaction is taking place. We'll parse the details we know of the plan, including who's purchasing, what it means for the app's algorithm, and more. And later, we'll learn why so much foreign investment is still flowing to the U.S.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Earlier this month, a company called Tricolor abruptly filed for bankruptcy. The Texas-based firm offered auto loans to buyers with poor (or no) credit ratings. That so-called “subprime” auto market has grown to $80 billion. But Tricolor's collapse could make it harder for some buyers to get car loans. We hear more.

Thing is, station groups Nexstar and Sinclair — which control ABC affiliates that reach about 20% of the country — opted out. Nexstar is working on a $6 billion merger with Tegna, awaiting Trump administration approval. All of this highlights a widening gap between big TV networks and local station owners.

      <h1>Rate cut? So what?</h1>

(date: 2025-09-23)
      <p>
      <p>Newly appointed Fed governor Stephen Miran has argued the federal funds rate should be a full two percentage points lower than its current level. A major cut like that could lower bond yields and reduce borrowing costs, spurring spending. But longer-term, inflation would likely balloon. After that: Auto dealers face new obstacles as EV tax credits end, a traveling nurse navigates frequent moves, and U.S. economic growth is “more resilient than expected,&quot; according to an OECD report.</p>

      <h1>What happened to American soft power?</h1>

(date: 2025-09-23)
      <p>
      <p>President Trump is not a fan of the United Nations—he made that clear in his speech to the United Nations General Assembly today. Under Trump, the United States has pulled back from several efforts, including U.N. organizations, that have contributed to the country’s so-called soft power goals. On the show today, Joshua Eisenman, professor of politics in the Keough School of Global Affairs at the University of Notre Dame, joins Kimberly to discuss the changing role of the U.S. in global politics and how China is seizing this moment to gain more influence.</p>

Miran wants steeper rate cuts, arguing that stricter controls at the borders and deportations will free up housing, make it less expensive, and keep a lid on inflation at a time of tariffs. We'll discuss what the data says about his claims. Also: growing threats to undersea data cables and an update on the cyberattack affecting Jaguar and Land Rover production.</p>

(date: 2025-09-23)
      <p>
      <p>The newest member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors — close ally of President Donald Trump, Stephen Miran — made his case for more (and larger) interest rate cuts in a speech yesterday at the Economic Club of New York. He argued that the president's policies will push prices down, so the Fed doesn’t have to worry that lowering interest rates will spark inflation. Plus, entrepreneurship could suffer following the Trump administration's new $100,000 fee for H-1B visas.</p>

Then, would you move back to your hometown for a 25% tax cut? Cyprus is hoping this proposal will tempt some of its diaspora to return.

      <h1>A golden opportunity for tech defense firms</h1>

(date: 2025-09-23)
      <p>
      <p>There’s a race going on among tech firms — big and small — to join in the construction of what President Trump has dubbed the Golden Dome, a missile defense system similar to Israel’s Iron Dome. Tens of billions of dollars in military contracts are at stake. In fact, the total cost might be in the trillions and the project could stretch a decade.</p>
<p>The technology and scale needed to make this all happen is, so far, largely unproven. And a whole host of tech firms are trying to show that they can help with the very complex undertaking. Marketplace’s Nova Safo spoke with Sheera Frenkel, reporter at the New York Times, about some of the tech that would make this whole system work.</p>

Also in this episode: GOP-led changes to the H-1B visa program could hurt U.S. businesses long-term, home sellers are cautious as supply dwindles, and the new farm bill faces familiar obstacles.</p>

      <p>The Trump administration is working to tamp down alarm over a new, $100,000 visa fee it announced on Friday. Technology, finance, and other major companies that depend on employees holding H-1B visas had initially thought the fee would be applied to existing visa holders, and those with H-1B workers who were temporarily abroad panicked. The fee only applies to new visa applicants, though, the White House later clarified. Also: an AI industry political action network and dark clouds for Broadway productions.</p>

There have been well-publicized instances of people seeking companionship from chatbots and it leading to tragedy. In this instance, it caused heartbreak. The story involves the Chinese AI firm Deepseek which, earlier this year, launched a chatbot that's almost as good as its American rivals. Soon after the launch, a young woman began a conversation with that chatbot. Marketplace’s China correspondent Jennifer Pak takes the story from there.</p>

      <h1>Get got by Insta-scammers?</h1>

(date: 2025-09-19)
      <p>
      <p>If you have, you're not alone. American consumers lost more than $1 billion to fraud on social media in the first six months of this year, according to the Federal Trade Commission. That’s almost ten times what it was five years ago. Today, we'll hear how consumers can protect themselves. But first, we know what the Federal Reserve did with short-term interest rates this week. What's driving long-term interest rates right now?</p>

      <p>Zillow reports that new listings fell to a record low in August, with sellers putting about 7% fewer homes up for sale than in July. Meanwhile, homes are staying on the market longer than a year ago, and home prices are barely growing in most markets. What's going on? Plus, Harvard economist Jason Furman cautions that we could get stuck in slow monthly job growth as a result of immigration policy.</p>

      <p>During the 2024 election, the cryptocurrency industry, including political action committees, accounted for nearly half of all of the corporate money going into the election, according to the watchdog group Public Citizen.
