Amazon’s Big Nuclear Deal Different</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-16, from: Heatmap News</p>

First it was Microsoft and Constellation

<a href="https://kairospower.com/external_updates/google-and-kairos-power-partner-to-deploy-500-mw-of-clean-electricity-generation/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>buy
power from small modular reactors built by Kairos</u></a>. Now today,
<a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/sustainability/amazon-nuclear-small-modular-reactor-net-carbon-zero" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Amazon
has said</u></a> it’s investing in X-energy, the small modular reactor
and fuel company, and supporting a joint project by X-energy and Energy
Northwest, the Washington state public utility.
</p>
<p>
So what makes this deal different from all other nuclear tech deals?
</p>
<p>
“What makes this significantly different is the investment,” Brett
Rampal, a senior director at Veriten, an energy advisory company, told
me. Amazon is not just buying the power that a nuclear reactor will
produce after it’s completed. It’s getting involved in the projects
themselves.
</p>
<p>
This has not typically been how big tech companies with commitments to
reduce emissions and rapidly expanding energy needs to
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/iea-world-energy-outlook-2024" target="_self"><u>power
more data centers</u></a> get involved with nuclear power.
</p>
<p>
The
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/microsoft-three-mile-island-nuclear-constellation" target="_self"><u>Microsoft/Constellation
deal to restart Three Mile Island</u></a> did not entail Microsoft
taking on the financial and logistical burden of upgrading the plant so
that it could be up and running again in a few years — for that,
Constellation will be putting $1.6 billion of its own money into the
plant. Instead, Microsoft signed a 20-year deal for the plant’s output,
known as a power purchase agreement, which
<a href="https://x.com/ArnabDatta321/status/1846539077056688503" target="_blank"><u>guarantees
a price</u></a> for the plant’s product. These types of deals were
pioneered by Google to support renewables projects by giving them a
guaranteed income independent of how electricity prices might fluctuate
in whatever market they were selling into.
</p>
<p>
Amazon’s deal, on the other hand, is a “direct investment in the Energy
Northwest project,” an X-energy spokesperson told me. According to an
Amazon spokesperson, that means a “capital commitment to fund
development, licensing and construction of an SMR project with Energy
Northwest in Washington State,” a spokesperson told me. The project
would be sited near the existing Columbia Generating Station in
Richland.
</p>
<p>
“This is Amazon saying, <em><em>We’re in, and we need this, and we’re
putting skin in the game directly</em></em>,” Rampal said. By contrast,
other nuclear deals like Microsoft’s and Google’s “send demand signals
and are, <em><em>Hey, we’ll be there when you’re done</em></em>.”
</p>
<p>
Energy Northwest and X-energy signed a joint development agreement for
the project last year. If all goes as planned, the finished facility
could be as large as 960 megawatts from 12 X-energy 80-megawatt
“modules.” Amazon could buy the electricity from up to four of the
modules, totaling 320 megawatts. Amazon said that the project “will help
meet the forecasted energy needs of the Pacific Northwest beginning in
the early 2030s.” (Last year X-energy and Energy Northwest
<a href="https://x-energy.com/media/news-releases/energy-northwest-x-energy-joint-development-agreement-xe-100" target="_blank"><u>said
the project would be online</u></a> “by 2030.”)
</p>
<p>
“We’ve been working for years to develop this project at the urging of
our members, and have found that taking this first, bold step is
difficult for utilities, especially those that provide electricity to
ratepayers at the cost of production,” Greg Cullen, Energy Northwest’s
vice president for energy services and development, said in a release.
“We applaud Amazon for being willing to use their financial strength,
need for power, and know-how to lead the way to a reliable, carbon-free
power future for the region.”
</p>
<p>
That “first, bold” step is difficult because nuclear development is
notoriously risky even with proven technologies, let alone novel designs
like X-energy’s. The only other small modular reactor deal in the United
States, between NuScale (which has the only approved small modular
reactor design) and a coalition of Mountain West utilities,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/nuscale-small-modular-reactor-nuclear-costs-inflation" target="_self"><u>fell
through due to escalating costs</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Amazon is also anchoring an equity investment in X-energy itself,
alongside Citadel founder Ken Griffin and other investors. Amazon said
its investment in X-energy “includes manufacturing capacity to develop
the SMR equipment to support more than 5 gigawatts of new nuclear energy
projects utilizing X-energy’s technology.”
</p>
<p>
The reactor design that Energy Northwest and X-energy plan to deploy,
the Xe-100, is in the
<a href="https://www.nrc.gov/reactors/new-reactors/advanced/who-were-working-with/licensing-activities/pre-application-activities/xe-100.html" target="_blank"><u>“pre-application”
process</u></a> with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. X-energy and the
NRC have been engaging with each other since 2018, according to the
docket for the project.
</p>
<p>
Amazon also announced that it had signed a memorandum of understanding
with Virginia utility Dominion Energy to look into SMR projects. Earlier
this year, Dominion
<a href="https://news.dominionenergy.com/2024-07-10-Dominion-Energy-takes-important-step-to-determine-feasibility-of-Small-Modular-Reactor-SMR-technology-to-support-customers-needs" target="_blank"><u>put
out a request for proposals for SMRs</u></a> at its existing North Anna
site near Richmond, whose two reactors have a capacity of around 1,800
megawatts.
</p>
<p>
The Department of Energy has estimated that existing nuclear sites could
host an additional 60 to 95 gigawatts of new nuclear power, which means
the United States’ nuclear output could double without having to set up
a new site for a reactor. The North Anna site has an “early site permit”
from the NRC, which approves a particular site for nuclear reactors.

<p>date: 2024-10-16, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
The Small Business Administration’s disaster loan program has run dry,
meaning the feds can’t make new, low-interest loans to help people
rebuild after Hurricanes Helene and Milton. The SBA says it won’t be
able to make any new disaster loans until Congress appropriates more
money, but members of Congress aren’t scheduled to be back in session
until November. And later: Canada’s tourism industry recovery and
California’s gasoline reserve.

id="nebraskas-high-court-says-people-with-felony-records-can-register-to-vote">Nebraska’s
high court says people with felony records can register to vote</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>OMAHA, Neb. — Nebraska’s top election official had no authority to
declare unconstitutional a state law that restored the voting rights of
those who have been convicted of a felony, the state Supreme Court ruled
Wednesday in a decision with implications for the approaching
election.</p>
<p>In July, Secretary of State Bob Evnen ordered county election
officials to reject the voter registrations of those with felony
convictions, citing an opinion issued by Attorney General Mike Hilgers.
That opinion, which Evnen had requested, deemed as unconstitutional a
law passed this year by the Legislature immediately restoring the voting
rights of people who have completed the terms of their felony
sentences.</p>
<p>Evnen’s order could have kept 7,000 or more Nebraska residents from
voting in the upcoming election, the American Civil Liberties Union
said. Many of them reside in Nebraska’s Omaha-centered 2nd Congressional
District, where both the race for president and Congress could be in
play.</p>
<p>In an otherwise reliably Republican state that, unlike most others,
splits its electoral votes, the district has twice awarded an electoral
vote to Democratic presidential candidates — once to Barack Obama in
2008 and again to Joe Biden in 2020. In a presidential race shown by
polling to be a dead heat, a single electoral vote could determine who
wins.</p>
<p>Given the Omaha district’s history, Democratic presidential nominee
Kamala Harris and Democratic groups have spent millions in the district
in the hopes of securing the electoral vote — far more than former
President Donald Trump and Republican groups.</p>
<p>The last day to register to vote for the 2024 general election in
Nebraska is Oct. 25 and must be done in person at a voter’s county
election commission office. Election Day is Nov. 5.</p>
<p>Hilgers’ opinion had said the new law violates the state
constitution’s separation of powers, saying only the state Board of
Pardons under the control of the executive branch can restore voting
rights through pardons.</p>
<p>Pardons are exceedingly rare in Nebraska. Evnen, Hilgers and Gov. Jim
Pillen make up the three-member Board of Pardons. All three are
Republicans.</p>
<p>The opinion also found unconstitutional a 2005 state law that
restored the voting rights of people with felony convictions two years
after they complete the terms of their sentences. </p>
<p>The ACLU is representing advocacy group Civic Nebraska and two
Nebraska residents, a Republican and an independent, who would be denied
the right to vote under Evnen’s directive. Because Evnen’s move came
only weeks ahead of the November election, the ACLU asked to take the
lawsuit directly to the Nebraska Supreme Court, and the high court
agreed. </p>
<p>Restoring the voting rights of former felons has drawn national
attention in recent years. In Florida, lawmakers weakened a 2018
voter-approved constitutional amendment to restore the voting rights of
most convicted felons. Following that, an election police unit
championed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis arrested 20 former felons.
Several of them said they were confused by the arrests because they had
been allowed to register to vote. </p>
<p>In Tennessee, lawmakers killed a bipartisan bill this year that would
have let residents convicted of felonies apply to vote again without
also restoring their gun rights. </p>
<p>Dozens of states allow people living with felony convictions to vote,
either for those not currently in prison or upon completion of their
sentences. Two states, Maine and Vermont, allow everyone, even those in
prison, to vote. But despite a recent trend toward restoration of
rights, felony disenfranchisement laws prevent around 5.85 million
people across the country from voting, according to the ACLU. </p>
<p>Felony disenfranchisement laws date to the Jim Crow era and mainly
targeted Black people, according to experts. Black registered voters
have an overwhelmingly positive view of Harris, according to a recent
poll from the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.</p>

The world is entering the “Age of Electricity,” with low-emission energy

Energy Outlook</a>. The report examines how the energy transition would
look in three different scenarios: following current energy and climate
policies, fulfilling all announced climate commitments, and achieving
net zero emissions by 2050. “The energy outlook is complex, multifaceted
and defies a single view on how the future might unfold,” the report
says. Some facts and figures:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>2</strong> – percent by which global energy demand rose in 2023.
Two-thirds of that was met by fossil fuels. But under current policies,
the energy demand growth rate would slow by about half by 2030.
</li>
<li>
<strong>2 trillion</strong> – dollars being invested in clean energy
projects annually, “almost double the combined amount spent on new oil,
gas, and coal supply.”
</li>
<li>
<strong>560</strong> – gigawatts of new renewable power capacity that
came online in 2023, a record high.
</li>
<li>
<strong>60</strong> – percent of the world’s new renewables capacity
that China accounted for last year.
</li>
<li>
<strong>200</strong> – clean energy trade measures introduced since
2020, up from 40 in the five years prior.
</li>
<li>
<strong>60</strong> – cents currently spent on grids and energy storage
per $1 spent on renewables. Parity is expected in the 2040s.
</li>
<li>
<strong>750 million</strong> – people lacking access to electricity,
mostly in sub-Saharan Africa. “Lack of access to energy remains the most
fundamental inequity in today’s energy system.”

<li>IEA report puts data center power demand into context
</h3>
<p>
The IEA’s report says the world should certainly be concerned about
rising electricity demand overall, but it also conveys that perhaps we
should all just calm down when it comes to data center load growth
driven by the rise of generative artificial intelligence,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/iea-world-energy-outlook-2024?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9uk4HFGH46TS8eG6EMttpYjKoW_lSGf-eEZJ1zD49a8hEuleFN0HV0KiUg6yOprhsHskkB" rel="noopener" target="_self">wrote
Heatmap’s Katie Brigham</a>. The report demonstrates that on a global
scale, data centers are pretty trivial compared to, say, the uptick in
electric vehicle adoption or increased demand for cooling. By 2030 in
the base case scenario, the IEA projects that data centers will account
for less than 10% of global electricity demand growth, which is roughly
equal to demand growth from desalination technologies, which we see much
less hand-wringing about. By comparison, the combination of rising
temperatures and rising incomes could create over 1,200 terawatt-hours
of additional cooling demand by 2035, more than the entire Middle East’s
electricity use.

<h2
id="us-police-urged-to-embrace-prevention-to-head-off-mass-shootings-attacks">US
police urged to embrace prevention to head off mass shootings,
attacks</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The U.S. agency charged with protecting the life of the
president of the United States and other high-ranking officials wants
state and local law enforcement to do more to stop potential threats
from escalating into violence.</p>
<p>And it is trying to show police agencies across the country exactly
how to do it.</p>
<p>The U.S. Secret Service’s National Threat Assessment Center (NTAC) on
Wednesday issued a new guide, encouraging law enforcement agencies to
create specific units to address threatening behavior in cases where
there are significant concerns, even though no laws have been
broken.</p>
<p>The guide specifically calls for police agencies to set up what NTAC
calls behavioral threat assessment units that can assess potential
dangers and then provide resources to make sure individuals get help
before they resort to violence.</p>
<p>“What our research has continuously found is that in many cases of
mass violence or other forms of targeted violence, the attacker’s
behavior was witnessed by community bystanders, some of whom sought to
report their concerns to public safety officials,” said Lina Alathari,
NTAC director, briefing reporters ahead of the guide’s release.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, many communities lack the structured systems to
receive, evaluate and respond to these reports in a way that would
reduce the likelihood of a violent or tragic outcome,” she said.</p>
<p>NTAC’s plea for law enforcement agencies to find ways to be more
proactive is not new.</p>
<p>A January 2023 report that analyzed 173 mass attacks carried out over
a five-year period urged communities to make it easier for witnesses to
report concerns and allow for earlier intervention from crisis
counselors and social services.</p>
<p>But the latest guidance comes as national security officials are
bracing for potential violence.</p>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security’s 2025 annual threat assessment,
issued last month, warned, “The terrorism threat environment in the
United States over the next year will remain high.</p>
<p>“The threat will continue to be characterized primarily by lone
offenders or small cells motivated to violence by a combination of
racial, religious, gender, or anti-government grievances; conspiracy
theories; and personalized factors,” it added.</p>
<p>The Secret Service has itself responded to two unrelated attempts to
assassinate former president and Republican presidential candidate
Donald Trump, coming under criticism for its failure to prevent one of
the would-be assassins from firing eight shots and injuring Trump before
he was stopped. </p>
<p>Investigators in that case have said the now dead 20-year-old gunman
had spent months researching assassinations and saw the former president
as a “target of opportunity.” </p>
<p>The new guide, issued Wednesday, aims to show police agencies how to
spot warning signs more quickly and find ways to intervene.</p>
<p>“We have seen historically that law enforcement in the United States
may at times feel limited in what they can do when responding to reports
of threats or other concerning behavior, particularly when that behavior
does not involve criminal activity,” said NTAC Assistant Chief Steven
Driscoll.</p>
<p>“This publication represents the most comprehensive guidance ever
produced on how to adapt and operationalize the Secret Services
Behavioral Threat Assessment model for use by state and local law
enforcement agencies,” he said.</p>
<p>Some state law enforcement agencies have already adopted the Secret
Service model.</p>
<p>North Carolina’s State Bureau of Investigation set up a behavioral
analysis threat assessment unit following a 2018 shooting that killed 17
people in Parkland, Florida.</p>
<p>The unit works with other state agencies and the state’s university
system to prevent potential attacks.</p>
<p>The state of Hawaii has likewise created a team to intervene in cases
of potential violence. And there is a similar program in Washington, the
U.S. capital.</p>
<p>“Behavioral threat assessment methodology has been proven effective
in safeguarding community time and again,” Driscoll said. “Prevention
happens successfully every day, and thankfully, these are stories that
we never hear about, when everybody goes home safely.”</p>
<p>As an example, Driscoll pointed to a 2021 NTAC study that looked at
67 incidents in which attacks on schools were averted due to students
and community members reporting warning signs so authorities could
intervene before anyone got hurt.</p>
<p>Despite such successes, NTAC said it does not have any data on how
many communities have behavioral threat assessment units. And officials
worry that too many state and local law enforcement agencies lack access
to programs that allow them to step in when a threat has been identified
but no law has been broken.</p>
<p>Some federal funding, though, is available.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said it has awarded almost
$90 million through its Targeted Violence and Terrorism Prevention Grant
Program since 2020.</p>
<p>And NTAC’s Alathari said the specialized units can be effective, even
when people and resources are scarce.</p>
<p>“Behavioral assessment units are able to vary in size,” she said in
response to a question from VOA. “An agency with limited resources to
establish this kind of unit could begin with just a single designated
violence prevention officer who maintains the responsibility of
gathering information, information to manage situations that might
revolve around potential violence.”</p>

cyber association calls for review of Intel products sold in China</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BEIJING — Intel products sold in China should be subject to a
security review, the Cybersecurity Association of China (CSAC) said on
Wednesday, alleging the U.S. chipmaker has “constantly harmed” the
country’s national security and interests. </p>
<p>While CSAC is an industry group rather than a government body, it has
close ties to the Chinese state and the raft of accusations against
Intel, published in a long post on its official WeChat group, could
trigger a security review from China’s powerful cyberspace regulator,
the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC). </p>
<p>“It is recommended that a network security review is initiated on the
products Intel sells in China, so as to effectively safeguard China’s
national security and the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese
consumers,” CSAC said. </p>
<p>Last year, the CAC barred domestic operators of key infrastructure
from buying products made by U.S. memory chipmaker Micron Technology Inc
after deeming the company’s products had failed its network security
review. </p>
<p>Intel did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The
company’s shares were down 2.7% in U.S. premarket trading.</p>

Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Ali Zaidi: </strong>The conversation in Congress right now makes
it seem like transmission is a Democratic policy priority when it boosts
reliability and lowers rates. I thought Republicans and Democrats both
agreed we need to boost reliability and lower rates. So I don’t know why
that needs to be offset by any measure.<br/> <br/> That’s thing number
one. Thing number two is … <br/> <br/> <strong>Robinson Meyer:
</strong>This is the challenge of talking about things, is that if
Democrats say, <em><em>oh, we really value this</em></em>, then suddenly
it’s a Democratic priority.<br/> <br/> <strong>Zaidi: </strong>Yeah. And
then the second is, how do we accelerate the siting and permitting of
things and then there is a how do we shift more power to the oil and gas
industry. The conversation around leasing, happening against a backdrop
where the industry itself is moving away from long-cycle investment to
short-cycle investment, it’s tough. So I would hope that more of the
permitting conversation were a permitting conversation.<br/> <br/>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>Well, one way this sometimes gets reflected is
that you’ll hear environmentalists say, any policy that makes the oil
and gas industry happy or bigger, we should not take. And that makes
making a compromise …<br/> <br/> <strong>Zaidi: </strong>And I reject
that. Yeah, look, if ExxonMobil wants to pay for a pipeline that will
help us deliver what was once solar and wind, as a fuel, to help us
decarbonize a steel plant, they can be for it and I can be for it. If
there is a — Blackstone, for example, has a
<a href="https://tallgrass.com/newsroom/press-releases/blackstone-infrastructure-partners-enters-into-definitive-agreement-to-acquire-controlling-interest-in-tallgrass-energy" target="_blank">Project
Tallgrass</a> that has converted a pipeline that used to pull
hydrocarbons out of the ground. It’s now flipped the pipeline around,
and is putting CO2 into the ground.<br/> <br/> They can be for that. I
can be for that — not speaking to the specific project, but
conceptually. So I don’t think … It’s not the actor. It’s the question
of whether this is directionally consistent with trying to chase down a
1.5 degree future or not. <br/> <br/> We are behind as a world, and we
need to run faster in that direction. If it’s not directionally
consistent, that’s a problem.

<h2 id="xi-says-china-willing-to-be-a-partner-friend-with-the-us">Xi
says China willing to be a partner, friend with the US</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BEIJING — Chinese President Xi Jinping said a successful partnership
between China and the United States is an opportunity for the two
countries to be enablers for each other’s development rather than an
obstacle, according to state media on Wednesday.</p>
<p>“China is willing to be a partner and friend with the United States.
This will benefit not only the two countries, but the world,” Xi said in
remarks from a letter to the 2024 annual awards dinner of the National
Committee on U.S.-China Relations, according to a CCTV news report.</p>
<p>Xi pointed out that China-U.S. relations are among the most important
bilateral relations in the world, which have a bearing on the future and
destiny of mankind, according to the letter.</p>
<p>The two countries have been at odds over national security concerns,
ongoing trade spats as well as China’s actions in the South China Sea
and intensified military drills around Taiwan.</p>
<p>Trade relations soured over the past year and have centered around
issues including restrictions on electric vehicles and advanced
semiconductors.</p>
<p>“China has always handled China-U.S. relations in accordance with the
principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win
cooperation, and has always believed that the success of China and the
United States is an opportunity for each other,” Xi said.</p>

<h2 id="the-iea-isnt-sweating-data-center-electricity-demand">The IEA
Isn’t Sweating Data Center Electricity Demand</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-16, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzgxOTk3My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4ODIxNjU4Mn0.81ypNBWpjIi_-b-Si6Hy_5tP3bTGD32cB1TCHr4AhdY/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Early this morning, the International Energy Agency released its annual
<a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-outlook-2024" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>World
Energy Outlook</u></a>. And while the Paris-based agency says the world
should certainly be concerned about rising electricity demand overall,
it also conveys (not quite in so many words) that perhaps we should all
just calm down when it comes to data center load growth driven by the
rise of generative artificial intelligence.
</p>
<p>
The report demonstrates that on a global scale, data centers are pretty
trivial compared to, say, the uptick in electric vehicle adoption or
increased demand for cooling. By 2030 in the base case scenario, the IEA
projects that data centers will account for less than 10% of global
electricity demand growth, which is roughly equal to demand growth from
desalination technologies, which we see much less hand-wringing about.
By comparison, the combination of rising temperatures and rising incomes
could create over 1,200 terawatt-hours of additional cooling demand by
2035, more than the entire Middle East’s electricity use.

<small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">IEA</small>
</p>
<p>
The IEA emphasized that when it comes to data centers, “plausible high
and low sensitivities do not change the outlook fundamentally,” meaning
that regardless of factors such as how quickly renewables and other
low-emission energy sources are able to ramp up or the rate at which
computing efficiency improves, data centers are poised to be a small
piece of the overall pie.
</p>
<p>
The authors even sound an optimistic note as they urge readers to
consider the positive impacts that artificial intelligence could have on
the energy sector at large, writing that “the potential implications of
AI for energy are broader [than just their data center electricity use]
and include improved systems coordination in the power sector and
shorter innovation cycles.” As of now,
<a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2024/07/generative-ai-energy-emissions/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>folks
can only guess</u></a> as to whether the net benefits of AI will be
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/ai-climate-week-clean-energy" target="_self"><u>positive
or negative</u></a> from an emissions standpoint. But the report again
sounded relatively cheery as it noted that there is “a set of
low-emissions options available to meet this [data center] demand,” as
cleaner electricity sources are growing much faster than data center
electricity use.
</p>
<p>
The unbothered tone might seem surprising, given the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/biden-ai-electricity-demand" target="_self"><u>general
freakout</u></a> over demand growth as well as
<a href="https://heatmap.news/ideas/ai-additionality-framework" target="_self"><u>dueling</u></a>
<a href="https://heatmap.news/ideas/abundance-additionality-permitting-reform" target="_self"><u>perspectives</u></a>
over how to meet it. But while it’s important to put these numbers in
perspective, that task shouldn’t be an excuse not to act. After all,
even “a small percent of the pie” still leads to some pretty big
figures. For example, say data centers comprise a conservative 5% of
global electricity demand growth between now and 2030. That would mean
an additional 338 terawatt-hours of electricity demand by the end of the
decade, an estimate the IEA says could vary by as much as 170
terawatt-hours. So on the high end, global growth in data center
electricity demand could reach around 500 terawatt-hours by 2030, nearly
a quarter of
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/monthly/pdf/sec7_5.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>total
U.S. electricity generation last year</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
So while this might not level up to a crisis on a global scale, it’s
still very much a problem worth mitigating — all the more so because
data centers are heavily geographically concentrated, meaning local grid
impacts will be felt acutely. Back in April,
<a href="https://www.koomey.com/about.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Jonathan
Koomey</u></a>, an independent researcher, lecturer, and entrepreneur
who studies the energy and environmental impacts of information
technology,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-episode-10-ai-data-centers" target="_self"><u>discussed
this very issue</u></a> with Heatmap’s own Shift Key co-hosts, Robinson
Meyer and Jesse Jenkins. As Koomey put it, “A place like Ireland that
has, I think at last count 17%, 18% of its load from data centers, if
that grows, that could give them real challenges. Same thing with
Loudoun County in Virginia.”
</p>
<p>
The IEA also acknowledges this reality, noting that even if, globally,
there’s enough clean energy to go around, local constraints on
generation and grid capacity could be severe. But as Koomey told Heatmap
— and as, perhaps, the IEA is trying to tell us all — “it is not a
national story. It is a local story.”

id="georgia-judge-blocks-ballot-counting-rule-and-says-county-officials-must-certify-election-results">Georgia
judge blocks ballot counting rule and says county officials must certify
election results</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ATLANTA — A judge has blocked a new rule that requires Georgia
Election Day ballots to be counted by hand after the close of voting.
The ruling came a day after the same judge ruled that county election
officials must certify election results by the deadline set in law.</p>
<p>The State Election Board last month passed the rule requiring that
three poll workers each count the paper ballots — not votes — by hand
after the polls close.</p>
<p>The county election board in Cobb County, in Atlanta’s suburbs, had
filed a lawsuit seeking to have a judge declare that rule and five
others recently passed by the state board invalid, saying they exceed
the state board’s authority, weren’t adopted in compliance with the law
and are unreasonable.</p>
<p>In a ruling late Tuesday, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert
McBurney wrote, that the so-called hand count rule “is too much, too
late” and blocked its enforcement while he considers the merits of the
case.</p>
<p>McBurney on Monday had ruled in a separate case that “no election
superintendent (or member of a board of elections and registration) may
refuse to certify or abstain from certifying election results under any
circumstance.” While they are entitled to inspect the conduct of an
election and to review related documents, he wrote, “any delay in
receiving such information is not a basis for refusing to certify the
election results or abstaining from doing so.”</p>
<p>Georgia law says county election superintendents — generally
multimember boards — “shall” certify election results by 5 p.m. on the
Monday after an election, or the Tuesday if Monday is a holiday as it is
this year.</p>
<p>The two rulings came as early in-person voting began Tuesday in
Georgia.</p>
<p>They are victories for Democrats, liberal voting rights groups and
some legal experts who have raised concerns that Donald Trump’s allies
could refuse to certify the results if the former president loses to
Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris in next month’s presidential
election. They have also argued that new rules enacted by the
Trump-endorsed majority on the State Election Board could be used to
stop or delay certification and to undermine public confidence in the
results.</p>
<p>In blocking the hand count rule, McBurney noted that there are no
guidelines or training tools for its implementation and that the
secretary of state had said the rule was passed too late for his office
to provide meaningful training or support. The judge also wrote that no
allowances have been made in county election budgets to provide for
additional personnel or expenses associated with the rule.</p>
<p>“The administrative chaos that will — not may — ensue is entirely
inconsistent with the obligations of our boards of elections (and the
SEB) to ensure that our elections are fair legal, and orderly,” he
wrote.</p>
<p>The state board may be right that the rule is smart policy, McBurney
wrote, but the timing of its passage makes implementing it now “quite
wrong.” He invoked the memory of the riot at the U.S. Capitol by people
seeking to stop the certification of Democrat Joe Biden’s presidential
victory on Jan. 6, 2021, writing, “Anything that adds uncertainty and
disorder to the electoral process disserves the public.”</p>
<p>During a hearing earlier Tuesday, Robert Thomas, a lawyer for the
State Election Board, argued that the process isn’t complicated and that
estimates show that it would take extra minutes, not hours, to complete.
He also said memory cards from the scanners, which are used to tally the
votes, could be sent to the tabulation center while the hand count is
happening so reporting of results wouldn’t be delayed.</p>
<p>State and national Democratic groups that had joined the suit on the
side of the Cobb election board, along with the Harris campaign,
celebrated McBurney’s ruling in a joint statement: “From the beginning,
this rule was an effort to delay election results to sow doubt in the
outcome, and our democracy is stronger thanks to this decision to block
it.”</p>
<p>The certification ruling stemmed from a lawsuit filed by Julie Adams,
a Republican member of the election board in Fulton County, which
includes most of the city of Atlanta and is a Democratic stronghold.
Adams sought a declaration that her duties as an election board member
were discretionary and that she is entitled to “full access” to
“election materials.”</p>
<p>Long an administrative task that attracted little attention,
certification of election results has become politicized since Trump
tried to overturn his loss to Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 general
election. Republicans in several swing states, including Adams, refused
to certify results earlier this year and some have sued to keep from
being forced to sign off on election results.</p>
<p>Adams’ suit, backed by the Trump-aligned America First Policy
Institute, argued county election board members have the discretion to
reject certification. In court earlier this month, her lawyers also
argued county election officials could certify results without including
certain ballots if they suspect problems.</p>
<p>Judge McBurney wrote that nothing in Georgia law gives county
election officials the authority to determine that fraud has occurred or
what should be done about it. Instead, he wrote, state law says a county
election official’s “concerns about fraud or systemic error are to be
noted and shared with the appropriate authorities but they are not a
basis for a superintendent to decline to certify.”</p>
<p>The Democratic National Committee and Democratic Party of Georgia had
joined the lawsuit as defendants with the support of Harris’ campaign.
The campaign called the ruling a “major legal win.”</p>
<p>Adams said in a statement that McBurney’s ruling has made it clear
that she and other county election officials “cannot be barred from
access to elections in their counties.”</p>
<p>A flurry of election rules passed by the State Election Board since
August has generated a crush of lawsuits. McBurney earlier this month
heard a challenge to two rules having to do with certification brought
by the state and national Democratic parties. Another Fulton County
judge is set to hear arguments in two challenges to rules tomorrow — one
brought by the Democratic groups and another filed by a group headed by
a former Republican lawmaker. And separate challenges are also pending
in at least two other counties.</p>

id="troops-kicked-out-under-dont-ask-dont-tell-upgraded-to-honorable-discharges">Troops
kicked out under ‘don’t ask, don’t tell’ upgraded to honorable
discharges</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Pentagon announced Tuesday that more than 800
military personnel have seen their service records upgraded to honorable
discharges after previously being kicked out of the military under its
former “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy.</p>
<p>It is the latest development over the decades to undo past
discrimination against LGBTQ service members.</p>
<p>The 1951 Uniform Code of Military Justice’s Article 125 had
criminalized consensual gay sex. In 1993, former President Bill Clinton
modified the military’s policy to “don’t ask, don’t tell,” which allowed
LGBTQ troops to serve in the armed forces if they did not disclose their
sexual orientation.</p>
<p>That policy was repealed in 2011, when Congress allowed for their
open service in the military. The 1951 UCMJ code was modified in 2013 to
be limited to nonconsensual gay sex.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden in June announced he was issuing pardons to
service members convicted under repealed military policies.</p>
<p>Under “don’t ask, don’t tell,” thousands of service members still saw
their military service ended without an honorable discharge, meaning
they did not receive the military benefits they would have otherwise,
such as education benefits, and it also could have affected their
ability to apply for jobs or loans.</p>
<p>Last year, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered a review of cases
of former service members who might have been affected by the
policy.</p>
<p>The Pentagon estimates about 13,500 service members were released
from military service under “don’t ask, don’t tell.” With the review and
upgrades of the more than 800 troops announced Tuesday, the Pentagon
said that about 96% of the 13,500 personnel affected by the policy had
received an honorable discharge.</p>
<p>Not every case of the 13,500 needed review. Some of those personnel
did not serve long enough to qualify for benefits, were released with an
honorable discharge at the time, already had their discharges upgraded
through other means, or did not qualify for an upgrade due to other
violations.</p>
<p>“We will continue to honor the service and the sacrifice of all our
troops — including the brave Americans who raised their hands to serve
but were turned away because of whom they love. We will continue to
strive to do right by every American patriot who has honorably served
their country,” Austin said in a statement.</p>

rights groups seek investigation into Wisconsin text messages</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>madison, wisconsin — Voting rights advocates on Tuesday asked state
and federal authorities to investigate anonymous text messages
apparently targeting young Wisconsin voters, warning them not to vote in
a state where they are ineligible.</p>
<p>Free Speech for People, on behalf of the League of Women Voters of
Wisconsin, made the request to the U.S. Department of Justice as well as
the Wisconsin Department of Justice. The letter says that “thousands of
young voters across Wisconsin” received the text message last week,
including staff members at the League of Women Voters and students at
the University of Wisconsin.</p>
<p>The text in question cites Wisconsin state law prohibiting voting in
more than one place and says that violating the law can result in fines
of up to $10,000 and 3.5 years in prison.</p>
<p>“Don’t vote in a state where you’re not eligible,” the text said.</p>
<p>Wisconsin is known for having razor-thin presidential elections. Four
of the last six were decided by less than a percentage point. President
Joe Biden won in 2020 by less than 21,000 votes.</p>
<p>At least one person who received the text posted it on the social
media platform X.</p>
<p>The League of Women Voters, in its request for investigation, said
that without prompt action “the sender may continue its efforts to
frighten eligible young voters into not voting.”</p>
<p>Students attending college in Wisconsin can register to vote either
at their home address or their one at school.</p>
<p>“But now, many students and other young voters are fearful that they
will face criminal prosecution if they register and exercise their right
to vote — because of a malicious, inaccurate text sent by an anonymous
party,” the letter said.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Justice declined to comment.</p>
<p>Wisconsin Department of Justice spokesperson Gillian Drummond said
the department takes allegations of potential violations of election law
seriously. She said the agency was reviewing the information in the
request for an investigation and would assess “what, if any, follow-up
is appropriate based on the facts and the law.”</p>
<p>University of Wisconsin System spokesperson Mark Pitsch said in an
email that system officials were unaware of any security breach that may
have resulted in leaked student contact information. He added that
nothing has been reported to system officials about the text, and there
was no indication how many students may have received it.</p>
<p>Riley Vetterkind, a spokesperson for the Wisconsin Elections
Commission, said in an email to The Associated Press that the commission
can’t determine whether the text message violates state law because the
commission hasn’t received a formal complaint about it.</p>
<p>However, he called the message “concerning” and said it certainly
could leave recipients feeling intimidated. He urged recipients to
contact law enforcement directly if they are worried about the
message.</p>
<p>“We understand that these third-party text messages can be very
frustrating for voters,” Vetterkind said. “We recommend voters rely upon
official sources of election information, such as from state or local
election officials. Voters are free to ignore these text messages since
they are not sent or associated with an official source.”</p>
<p>The text message was sent as thousands of voters in Wisconsin are
casting absentee ballots. As of Monday, nearly 240,000 absentee ballots
had already been returned statewide.</p>
<p>Starting October 22, voters can start casting absentee ballots in
person.</p>
<p>Wisconsin is one of the “blue wall” states along with Michigan and
Pennsylvania that is key to winning for either Democratic Vice President
Kamala Harris or Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.</p>

id="tech-firms-increasingly-look-to-nuclear-power-for-data-center">Tech
firms increasingly look to nuclear power for data center</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>As energy-hungry computer data centers and artificial intelligence
programs place ever greater demands on the U.S. power grid, tech
companies are looking to a technology that just a few years ago appeared
ready to be phased out: nuclear energy. </p>
<p>After several decades in which investment in new nuclear facilities
in the U.S. had slowed to a crawl, tech giants Microsoft and Google have
recently announced investments in the technology, aimed at securing a
reliable source of emissions-free power for years into the future.  </p>
<p>Earlier this year, online retailer Amazon, which has an expansive
cloud computing business, announced it had reached an agreement to
purchase a nuclear energy-fueled data center in Pennsylvania and that it
had plans to buy more in the future. </p>
<p>However, the three companies’ strategies rely on somewhat different
approaches to the problem of harnessing nuclear energy, and it remains
unclear which, if any, will be successful. </p>
<p>Energy demand </p>
<p>Data centers, which concentrate thousands of powerful computers in
one location, consume prodigious amounts of power, both to run the
computers themselves and to operate the elaborate systems put in place
to dissipate the large amount of heat they generate.  </p>
<p>A recent study by Goldman Sachs estimated that data centers currently
consume between 1% and 2% of all available power generation. That
percentage is expected to at least double by the end of the decade, even
accounting for new power sources coming online. The study projected a
160% increase in data center power consumption by 2030. </p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Energy has estimated that the largest data
centers can consume more than 100 megawatts of electricity, or enough to
power about 80,000 homes. </p>
<p>Small, modular reactors </p>
<p>Google’s plan is, in some ways, the most radical departure — both
from the current structure of the energy grid and from traditional means
of generating nuclear power. The internet search giant announced on
Monday that it has partnered with Kairos Power to fund the construction
of up to seven small-scale nuclear reactors that, across several
locations, would combine to generate 500 megawatts of power. </p>
<p>The small modular reactors (SMRs) are a new, and largely untested,
technology. Unlike sprawling nuclear plants, SMRs are compact, requiring
much less infrastructure to keep them operational and safe. </p>
<p>“The smaller size and modular design can reduce construction
timelines, allow deployment in more places, and make the final project
delivery more predictable,” Google and Kairos said in a press release.
 </p>
<p>The companies said they intend to have the first of the SMRs online
by 2030, with the rest to follow by 2035. </p>
<p>Great promise </p>
<p>Sola Talabi, president of Pittsburgh Technical, a nuclear consulting
firm, told VOA that SMR technology holds great promise for the future.
He said that the plants’ small size will eliminate many of the safety
concerns that larger reactors present. </p>
<p>For example, some smaller reactors generate so much less heat than
larger reactors that they can utilize “passive” cooling systems that are
not susceptible to the kind of mechanical failures that caused disaster
at Japan’s Fukushima plant in 2011 and the Soviet Union’s Chernobyl
plant in 1986.  </p>
<p>Talabi, who is also an adjunct faculty member in nuclear engineering
at the University of Pittsburgh and University of Michigan, said that
SMRs’ modular nature will allow for rapid deployment and substantial
cost savings as time goes on. </p>
<p>“Pretty much every reactor that has been built [so far] has been
built like it’s the first one,” he said. “But with these reactors,
because we will be able to use the same processes, the same facilities,
to produce them, we actually expect that we will be able to … achieve
deployment scale relatively quickly.” </p>
<p>Raising doubts </p>
<p>Not all experts are convinced that SMRs are going to live up to
expectations. </p>
<p>Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety for the Union of
Concerned Scientists, told VOA that the Kairos reactors Google is hoping
to install use a new technology that has never been tested under
real-world conditions.</p>
<p>“At this point, it’s just hope without any real basis in experimental
fact to believe that this is going to be a productive and reliable
solution for the need to power data centers over the medium term,” he
said. </p>
<p>He pointed out that the large-scale deployment of new nuclear
reactors will also result in the creation of a new source of nuclear
waste, which the U.S. is still struggling to find a way to dispose of at
scale.  </p>
<p>“I think what we’re seeing is really a bubble — a nuclear bubble —
which I suspect is going to be deflated once these optimistic, hopeful
agreements turn out to be much harder to execute,” Lyman said. </p>
<p>Three Mile Island </p>
<p>Microsoft and Amazon have plotted a more conventional path toward
powering their data centers with nuclear energy. </p>
<p>In its announcement last month, Microsoft revealed that it has
reached an agreement with Constellation Energy to restart a mothballed
nuclear reactor at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania and to use the
power it produces for its data operations. </p>
<p>Three Mile Island is best known as the site of the worst nuclear
disaster in U.S. history. In 1979, the site’s Unit 2 reactor suffered a
malfunction that resulted in radioactive gases and iodine being released
into the local environment.  </p>
<p>However, the facility’s Unit 1 reactor did not fail, and it operated
safely for several decades. It was shut down in 2019, after cheap shale
gas drove the price of energy down so far that it made further
operations economically unfeasible. </p>
<p>It is expected to cost $1.6 billion to bring the reactor back online,
and Microsoft has agreed to fund that investment. It has also signed an
agreement to purchase power from the facility for 20 years. The
companies say they believe that they can bring the facility back online
by 2028. </p>
<p>Amazon’s plan, by contrast, does not require either new technology or
the resurrection of an older nuclear facility. </p>
<p>The data center that the company purchased from Talen Energy is
located on the same site as the fully operational Susquehanna nuclear
plant in Salem, Pennsylvania, and draws power directly from it. </p>
<p>Amazon characterized the $650 million investment as part of a larger
effort to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2040.</p>

paradox</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-15, from: Market Place, Make me Smart</p>

<p>
Today we’re talking about a key piece of the global transition to
renewable energy: metals. Specifically, metals like copper, lithium and
cobalt that we need to build wind turbines, electric vehicles and to
improve our energy grid. Vince Beiser, author of the forthcoming book
“Power Metal: The Race for the Resources That Will Shape the Future,”
said we’ll need hundreds of millions more tons of these metals. But
mining them comes at a cost. On the show today, Beiser explains the
environmental and social consequences of mining for these metals,
China’s dominance over the supply chain, and ways to make the transition
to renewables more fair. Plus, why mining in space is a pipe dream, at
least for now.

id="fema-resumes-door-to-door-visits-in-north-carolina-after-threats-tied-to-disinformation">FEMA
resumes door-to-door visits in North Carolina after threats tied to
disinformation</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Federal disaster personnel have resumed door-to-door visits as part
of their hurricane-recovery work in North Carolina, an effort
temporarily suspended amid threats that prompted officials to condemn
the spread of disinformation. </p>
<p>Over the weekend, reports emerged that workers with the Federal
Emergency Management Agency could be targeted by militia as the
government responds to Hurricane Helene. A sheriff’s office said Monday
that one man was arrested during an investigation, but that the suspect
acted alone. </p>
<p>FEMA made operational changes to keep personnel safe “out of an
abundance of caution,” agency Administrator Deanne Criswell said at a
briefing Tuesday. FEMA workers were back in the field Monday,
accompanied by Criswell, and she said disaster-assistance teams helping
survivors apply for FEMA aid as well as state and local assistance will
continue to go door-to-door. She emphasized that the agency isn’t going
anywhere. </p>
<p>“The federal family has been here working side by side with the state
since Day One. These are people who put their lives on hold to help
those who have lost everything,” Criswell said. “So let me be clear: I
take these threats seriously.” </p>
<p>North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper said he directed the state’s
Department of Public Safety to coordinate law enforcement assistance for
FEMA and other responders. He stressed the damage that internet rumors
and falsehoods were causing and said officials may never know how many
people won’t apply for assistance because of bad information. </p>
<p>“There’s still a persistent and dangerous flow of misinformation
about recovery efforts in western North Carolina that can lead to
threats and intimidation, breeds confusion and demoralizes storm
survivors and response workers alike,” Cooper said at the briefing. “If
you’re participating in spreading this stuff, stop it. Whatever your aim
is, the people you are really hurting are those in western North
Carolina who need help.” </p>
<p>The Rutherford County Sheriff’s Office said it received a call
Saturday about a man with an assault rifle who made a comment “about
possibly harming” FEMA employees working in the hard-hit areas of Lake
Lure and Chimney Rock in the North Carolina mountains. A man was charged
with “going armed to the terror of the public,” a misdemeanor, and was
released after posting bond. </p>
<p>The sheriff’s office said it received initial reports that a
“truckload of militia” was involved in the threat, but further
investigation determined the man acted alone. </p>
<p>FEMA has faced rampant disinformation about its response to Helene,
which hit Florida on September 26 before heading north and leaving a
trail of destruction across six states. </p>
<p>Asked what might be fueling disinformation, Cooper said social media
has become more extreme, but he also pointed to politics. </p>
<p>“This is happening in the middle of an election where candidates are
using people’s misery to sow chaos for their own political objectives —
and it’s wrong,” he said. </p>
<p>Former President Donald Trump and his allies have seized on the
storm’s aftermath to spread false information about the Biden
administration’s response in the final weeks before the election. Their
debunked claims include false statements that victims can only receive
$750 in aid, that emergency response funds were diverted to immigrants,
that people accepting federal relief money could see their land seized
and that FEMA is halting trucks full of supplies. </p>
<p>Helene decimated remote towns throughout Appalachia, left millions
without power, knocked out cellular service and killed at least 246
people. It was the deadliest hurricane to hit the U.S. mainland since
Katrina in 2005. </p>
<p>Terrie Daughtry, a volunteer handling therapy dogs Tuesday at a FEMA
Disaster Recovery Center in Asheville, said threats and misinformation —
including the militia rumors — made her feel unsafe for the first time
in several trips to volunteer at disaster sites. </p>
<p>“I’m not coming to risk my life with it all, to be shot or hurt or
trampled because of lunacy,” said Daughtry, who volunteers with Therapy
Dogs International. She said she previously traveled to help in the
aftermath of the Pulse Nightclub shooting in Orlando, Florida, floods in
Virginia and tornadoes in Texas, Oklahoma and Alabama. </p>
<p>She and another volunteer have been using their therapy dogs to calm
people waiting in line to make FEMA claims. They hand out candy, let
people pet the dogs and talk to people about their experiences. </p>
<p>Despite the extra stress from the “absolutely ridiculous” threats and
misinformation, Daughtry said she’s seen some amazing moments of human
spirit. At one point on Monday, someone in line started playing a guitar
and singing about having no water, she said. Eventually, the whole line
sang along. </p>
<p>“These are special people. They’re singing in horrible adversity,”
she said. “It made me tear up being there, and it’s making me tear up
now.”</p>

id="georgia-judge-rules-county-election-officials-must-certify-election-results">Georgia
judge rules county election officials must certify election results</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ATLANTA, georgia — A Georgia judge has ruled county election
officials must certify election results by the deadline set in law and
cannot exclude any group of votes from certification even if they
suspect error or fraud. </p>
<p>Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney ruled that “no
election superintendent (or member of a board of elections and
registration) may refuse to certify or abstain from certifying election
results under any circumstance.”</p>
<p>While they have the right to inspect the conduct of an election and
to review related documents, he wrote, “any delay in receiving such
information is not a basis for refusing to certify the election results
or abstaining from doing so.” </p>
<p>Georgia law says county election superintendents, which are
multimember boards in most counties, “shall” certify election results by
5 p.m. on the Monday after an election — or the Tuesday if Monday is a
holiday as it is this year. </p>
<p>The ruling comes as early voting began Tuesday in Georgia. </p>
<p>Julie Adams, a Republican member of the Fulton County election board,
had asked the judge to declare that her duties as an election board
member were discretionary and that she is entitled to “full access” to
“election materials.” </p>
<p>Long an administrative task that attracted little attention,
certification of election results has become politicized since
then-President Donald Trump tried to overturn his loss to Democrat Joe
Biden in the 2020 general election. Republicans in several swing states,
including Adams, refused to certify election results earlier this year
and some have sued to keep from being forced to sign off on election
results. </p>
<p>Adams’ suit, backed by the Trump-aligned America First Policy
Institute, argues that county election board members have the discretion
to reject certification. In court earlier this month, her lawyers also
argued that county election officials could certify results without
including ballots that appear to have problems, allaying concerns of a
board member who might otherwise vote not to certify. </p>
<p>Judge McBurney wrote that nothing in Georgia law gives county
election officials the authority to determine that fraud has occurred or
what should be done about it. Instead, he wrote, the law says a county
election official’s “concerns about fraud or systemic error are to be
noted and shared with the appropriate authorities but they are not a
basis for a superintendent to decline to certify.” </p>
<p>Both sides in the fight over certification claimed McBurney’s ruling
as a victory. </p>
<p>The Democratic National Committee and Democratic Party of Georgia,
with the support of Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign,
had joined the lawsuit as defendants and called the ruling a “major
legal win.” </p>
<p>Adams has said she was not given access to county election documents
with enough time to consider them before the certification vote for
elections earlier this year. She said in a statement that McBurney’s
ruling has made it clear that she and other county election board
members “cannot be barred from access to elections in their
counties.”</p>

id="desantis-praises-milton-recovery-efforts-as-rising-floodwaters-persist-in-florida">DeSantis
praises Milton recovery efforts as rising floodwaters persist in
Florida</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>TALLAHASSEE, Florida — While there’s still more work to do, Florida
Governor Ron DeSantis on Tuesday praised Hurricane Milton recovery
efforts, saying power has never been restored to so many so quickly
after a major storm.</p>
<p>“President (Ronald) Reagan used to say the most terrifying words in
the English language are, ‘I’m from the government and I’m here to
help.’ There’s a lot of wisdom in that, but I don’t think The Gipper
ever saw Florida respond to a natural disaster, because we get after it
and we do make a difference,” DeSantis said at a news conference in
front of a flooded road in Zephyrhills.</p>
<p>There were still about 170,000 customers without electricity, rivers
continued to rise in some flooded areas and the state was still
providing free gas to residents struggling to top off their tanks. But
DeSantis pointed out that more than 4 million customers had power
restored less than a week after the Category 3 storm.</p>
<p>At least 11 people died less than two weeks after Hurricane Helene
inflicted major damage in Florida and other Southeastern states. The
death toll from Helene is more than 240. While most gas stations were
back up and running, the state still has 10 active fuel distribution
centers providing free gas to residents. DeSantis said more than 2
million gallons had been distributed so far.</p>
<p>As happened two years ago during Hurricane Ian, parts of central
Florida on Tuesday were flooding almost a week after Milton made
landfall due to the rising St. Johns River.</p>
<p>In Seminole County, north of Orlando, crews closed roads along the
shores of Lake Harney and Lake Jesup after several homes were flooded by
the river. Since last Thursday, at least 15 people have been evacuated
from homes in nearby Geneva and a neighborhood in Altamonte Springs
located in a crook of the Little Wekiva River.</p>
<p>Water levels along the St. Johns River were expected to crest later
in the week.</p>
<p>In Sumter County, home to the sprawling retirement community, The
Villages, residents along the Little Withlacoochee River were being
encouraged to evacuate as river levels rose. Residents who decided to
evacuate were offered shelter at the Sumter County Fairgrounds.</p>

id="us-slaps-sanctions-on-sham-charity-fundraising-for-popular-front-for-liberation-of-palestine">US
slaps sanctions on ‘sham charity’ fundraising for Popular Front for
Liberation of Palestine</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The United States on Tuesday imposed sanctions on what
it said was a key international fundraiser for the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), which Washington has designated a
terrorist organization.</p>
<p>The U.S. Treasury Department, in action taken with Canada, said in a
statement it imposed sanctions on the Samidoun Palestinian Prisoner
Solidarity Network, accusing it of being “a sham charity that serves as
an international fundraiser” for the PFLP. </p>
<p>The PFLP, which has also taken part in the fight against Israel in
Gaza, was designated a Foreign Terrorist Organization and a Specially
Designated Global Terrorist by the U.S. in October 1997 and October
2001, respectively. </p>
<p>The Treasury said PFLP uses Samidoun to fundraise in Europe and North
America. The group’s activities were banned by Germany last year. </p>
<p>“Organizations like Samidoun masquerade as charitable actors that
claim to provide humanitarian support to those in need, yet in reality
divert funds for much-needed assistance to support terrorist groups,”
Treasury’s acting under secretary for terrorism and financial
intelligence, Bradley Smith, said in the statement. </p>
<p>The Samidoun Palestinian Prisoner Solidarity Network did not respond
immediately to a Reuters request for comment. </p>
<p>A member of the PFLP’s leadership abroad was also targeted with
sanctions on Tuesday. </p>
<p>Canada announced the listing of Samidoun as a terrorist entity on
Tuesday. “Violent extremism, acts of terrorism or terrorist financing
have no place in Canadian society or abroad,” Canadian Public Safety
Minister Dominic LeBlanc said in a statement announcing the
listing. </p>
<p>The Treasury said the PFLP remained active in the conflict between
Israel and Hamas, including participating in the Oct. 7 attack on
Israel, in which 1,200 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage
to Gaza, by Israeli tallies. </p>
<p>More than 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in the offensive so
far, according to Gaza’s health authorities.</p>

id="as-us-presidential-vote-looms-newsrooms-focus-on-how-to-stay-safe">As
US presidential vote looms, newsrooms focus on how to stay safe</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington/New York — On a rainy day in September, a group of
journalists gathered in a nondescript office building outside
Washington. Some were seasoned reporters, others still students. But
they were all there to learn how to stay safe while covering elections
and unrest.</p>
<p>Organized by the International Women’s Media Foundation, or IWMF, the
training session was part of a national campaign to teach journalists
based in the United States how to stay safe on assignment, including
while reporting on the presidential campaign.</p>
<p>Over the past year, the IWMF has trained more than 620 journalists
across 13 states.</p>
<p>“This safety tour has really been illuminating. Unfortunately, what
we are hearing is quite alarming, and it’s not just about election
reporting,” IWMF executive director Elisa Lees Munoz told VOA. “What
we’re understanding more and more is that literally every beat in
America has become a polarizing beat, and therefore has become a
dangerous beat.”</p>
<p>Three times as many journalists have been arrested in the U.S. this
year compared to last year, according to the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker.
More journalists have been assaulted too, according to the group’s
data.</p>
<p>“We’re seeing journalists still struggling every day to uphold that
basic right of freedom of the press,” Kirstin McCudden, the Tracker’s
managing editor, told VOA at the group’s office in Brooklyn. “It’s a
little alarming.”</p>
<p>Many of the incidents took place during pro-Palestine protests. In
one case, three photojournalists were arrested in Chicago in August
while covering a protest on the outskirts of the Democratic National
Convention.</p>
<p>“Police departments feel that they have the power to violate the
rights of journalists. Then what ends up happening is it turns into a
snowball effect. More police agencies crack down even harder,” said
Trevor Timm, executive director of the Freedom of the Press Foundation,
which publishes the Tracker.</p>
<p>While press freedom is often a local issue, it also matters what
presidential candidates are saying and how they treat the press,
multiple analysts said.</p>
<p>The campaign of former President Donald Trump has been punctuated by
the same kinds of attacks against the media that characterized his
presidency, the analysts who spoke with VOA said.</p>
<p>Leading up to and during Trump’s presidency, Stephanie Sugars, a
senior reporter at the Tracker, documented more than 2,000 anti-media
posts by Trump on the social media platform X, then known as Twitter.
The tenor of those posts evolved from targeting individual journalists
to targeting specific news outlets to targeting the media industry writ
large.</p>
<p>“A lot of that rhetoric is still in play and is part of his
playbook,” Sugars said. She added that the Tracker would monitor
anti-media posts from President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala
Harris if those kinds of posts existed.</p>
<p>Sugars cautioned against solely blaming Trump for the increased
hostility facing journalists in the U.S. But, she said, he hasn’t helped
the situation either.</p>
<p>“If you sow distrust in these sorts of external sources and really
encourage your followers, those who support you, to only believe what
you specifically say, that’s a great way to maintain firm control over
what the narrative is, what truth is understood to be, and that’s an
incredible amount of power to have,” Sugars said.</p>
<p>McCudden agreed. “Rhetoric does matter, and it’s fuel to the fire,”
she said.</p>
<p>In response to VOA’s request for comment, Trump’s presidential
campaign shared a statement that Republican National Committee
spokesperson Taylor Rogers originally provided to the conservative news
site the Daily Caller.</p>
<p>In it, Rogers described Trump as a “champion for free speech” and
said that “everyone was safer under President Trump, including
journalists.”</p>
<p>Mitigating risk</p>
<p>The hostile environment for journalists comes at a time when trust in
media is already at a record low in the U.S., according to Gallup.
Attacks or hostile rhetoric against the press only make the situation
worse.</p>
<p>So far, the Tracker has documented only a few violations directly
related to the election. But, McCudden said, “History tells us that we
should be worried and aware.”</p>
<p>She cited the January 6 insurrection on the Capitol, where 18
journalists were assaulted.</p>
<p>It may take a few days for the election results to be confirmed,
McCudden said. “And in that time, tensions will be high. And journalists
whose job it is to cover these tense times are also often in harm’s
way,” she said.</p>
<p>The IWMF’s safety training originally was directed at journalists in
combat zones and dangerous regions. But following the 2016 U.S.
presidential election, when attacks on the media began to rise, the IWMF
realized U.S. based journalists would benefit from them, too, according
to Munoz.</p>
<p>For Jennifer Thomas, a journalism professor at Howard University in
Washington, the training offered her the tools to better help her
students to stay safe.</p>
<p>“Back when I was reporting locally and then nationally and covering
news, we didn’t have to really be that concerned when we went out to
cover an event,” said Thomas, who previously worked at CNN. “Well, times
have changed.”</p>
<p>During the training, Thomas and the others were introduced to a range
of resources on issues including covering riots and dealing with an
arrest. Munoz thinks this information will become all the more important
for journalists in the U.S. in years to come.</p>

pandas arrive at Washington’s National Zoo; public debut set for
January</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The National Zoo’s long dark panda drought has come to
an end.</p>
<p>Eleven months after the zoo sent its three wildly popular pandas —
Mei Xiang, Tian Tian and their cub Xiao Qi Ji — back to China, a new
pair of bears arrived late Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>The three-year old giant pandas, named Bao Li and Qing Bao, were
flown from China to Dulles International Airport in suburban Virginia,
with a refueling stop in Alaska. They were loaded into special FedEx
trucks and arrived at the zoo just before noon.</p>
<p>“Our team has worked tirelessly to prepare for the pandas’ arrival,
and we’re thrilled to welcome Bao Li and Qing Bao to Washington, D.C.,
the only place you can see giant pandas for free in the nation,” said
Brandie Smith, the national zoo director who travelled to China to take
part in farewell ceremonies for the bears there. “As a result of our
collective efforts, today we joyfully celebrate a new chapter of our
52-year-long giant panda breeding and conservation program.”</p>
<p>The zoo was closed Tuesday to facilitate the arrivals. The bears will
be quarantined from the public for at least 30 days. A statement from
the zoo set the date for the bears’ official public debut and the
reopening of the renovated panda house as Jan. 24, 2025.</p>
<p>Bao Li (precious vigor) and Qing Bao (green treasure) arrive in
Washington as part of a new 10-year agreement with Chinese authorities.
The previous deal expired last year, leading to some concern among
American panda-lovers that Beijing was gradually pulling its furry
friendship ambassadors from American zoos amid rising diplomatic
tensions.</p>
<p>Breeding pairs in zoos in Memphis and San Diego had already returned
to China earlier and the four pandas in the Atlanta zoo left for China
last week.</p>
<p>That anxiety turned to optimism last November when Chinese President
Xi Jinping publicly stated a desire to continue the panda exchange
programs. This year, a new pair of bears has been delivered to the San
Diego Zoo, while another pair has been promised to San Francisco.</p>
<p>In Washington, National Zoo officials remained conspicuously silent
about negotiations for a new panda agreement, but they expressed
optimism about striking a new deal and launched a multimillion-dollar
renovation of its panda enclosure in anticipation. Then in late May,
Smith teamed up with first lady Jill Biden to announce that Bao Li and
Qing Bao would be arriving by the end of this year.</p>
<p>Pandas have become one of the unofficial symbols of the nation’s
capital, dating back to 1972 when the first pair — Ling Ling and Hsing
Hsing — were sent as a gift from Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai following
President Richard Nixon’s historic diplomatic visit to China. Later, a
rolling series of 10-year cooperation agreements was struck.</p>
<p>“The giant pandas are an iconic part of the Washington, D.C., story,
both for locals and incoming travelers alike,” said Elliott L. Ferguson,
II, president and CEO of Destination DC. “The interest and excitement
associated with their return directly benefits the entire city, bringing
further interest and visitors to our hotels, restaurants and other
attractions.”</p>
<p>The exact terms of the deal are still unclear; under previous 10-year
agreements the Chinese government receives $1 million per year, per
bear. Any cubs born in overseas zoos are typically returned to China
before they reach age four.</p>
<p>Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington,
credited the decades of cooperation with advancing research into panda
preservation and breeding. During the lifespan of these agreements,
giant pandas have been reclassified from an endangered species to merely
vulnerable.</p>
<p>“The current round of cooperation will focus on prevention and
treatment of major diseases, and protection of habitats and wild giant
panda populations,” Liu said in an email. “We hope the arrival of the
pandas will inject fresh impetus into exchanges between China and the
U.S., and help to stabilize the broader bilateral relationship as
well.”</p>

id="microsoft-cybercriminals-increasingly-help-russia-china-iran-target-us-allies">Microsoft:
Cybercriminals increasingly help Russia, China, Iran target US,
allies</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Russia, China and Iran are increasingly relying on
criminal networks to lead cyberespionage and hacking operations against
adversaries such as the United States, according to a report on digital
threats published Tuesday by Microsoft.</p>
<p>The growing collaboration between authoritarian governments and
criminal hackers has alarmed national security officials and
cybersecurity experts. They say it represents the increasingly blurred
lines between actions directed by Beijing or the Kremlin aimed at
undermining rivals and the illicit activities of groups typically more
interested in financial gain.</p>
<p>In one example, Microsoft’s analysts found that a criminal hacking
group with links to Iran infiltrated an Israeli dating site and then
tried to sell or ransom the personal information it obtained. Microsoft
concluded the hackers had two motives: to embarrass Israelis and make
money.</p>
<p>In another, investigators identified a Russian criminal network that
infiltrated more than 50 electronic devices used by the Ukrainian
military in June, apparently seeking access and information that could
aid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. There was no obvious financial motive
for the group, aside from any payment they may have received from
Russia.</p>
<p>Marriage of convenience</p>
<p>For nations such as Russia, China, Iran and North Korea, teaming up
with cybercriminals offers a marriage of convenience with benefits for
both sides. Governments can boost the volume and effectiveness of cyber
activities without added cost. For the criminals, it offers new avenues
for profit and the promise of government protection.</p>
<p>“We’re seeing in each of these countries this trend toward combining
nation-state and cybercriminal activities,” said Tom Burt, Microsoft’s
vice president of customer security and trust.</p>
<p>So far there is no evidence suggesting that Russia, China and Iran
are sharing resources with each other or working with the same criminal
networks, Burt said. But he said the growing use of private cyber
“mercenaries” shows how far America’s adversaries will go to weaponize
the internet.</p>
<p>Microsoft’s report analyzed cyber threats between July 2023 and June
2024, looking at how criminals and foreign nations use hacking, spear
phishing, malware and other techniques to gain access and control over a
target’s system. The company says its customers face more than 600
million such incidents every day.</p>
<p>Russia focused much of its cyber operations on Ukraine, trying to
enter military and government systems and spreading disinformation
designed to undermine support for the war among its allies.</p>
<p>Ukraine has responded with its own cyber efforts, including one last
week that knocked some Russian state media outlets offline.</p>
<p>US elections targeted</p>
<p>Networks tied to Russia, China and Iran have also targeted American
voters, using fake websites and social media accounts to spread false
and misleading claims about the 2024 election. Analysts at Microsoft
agree with the assessment of U.S. intelligence officials who say Russia
is targeting the campaign of Vice President Kamala Harris, while Iran is
working to oppose former President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Iran has also hacked into Trump’s campaign and sought,
unsuccessfully, to interest Democrats in the material. Federal officials
have also accused Iran of covertly supporting American protests over the
war in Gaza.</p>
<p>Russia and Iran will likely accelerate the pace of their cyber
operations targeting the U.S. as election day approaches, Burt said.</p>
<p>China, meanwhile, has largely stayed out of the presidential race,
focusing its disinformation on down-ballot races for Congress or state
and local office. Microsoft found networks tied to Beijing also continue
to target Taiwan and other countries in the region.</p>
<p>Denials from all parties</p>
<p>In response, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington
said allegations that China partners with cybercriminals are groundless
and accused the U.S. of spreading its own “disinformation about the
so-called Chinese hacking threats.”</p>
<p>In a statement, spokesperson Liu Pengyu said that “our position is
consistent and clear. China firmly opposes and combats cyberattacks and
cybertheft in all forms.”</p>
<p>Russia and Iran have also rejected accusations that they’re using
cyber operations to target Americans. Messages left with representatives
of those three nations and North Korea were not returned Monday.</p>
<p>Efforts to disrupt foreign disinformation and cyber capabilities have
escalated along with the threat, but the anonymous, porous nature of the
internet sometimes undercuts the effectiveness of the response.</p>
<p>Federal authorities recently announced plans to seize hundreds of
website domains used by Russia to spread election disinformation and to
support efforts to hack former U.S. military and intelligence figures.
But investigators at the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research
Lab found that sites seized by the government can easily and quickly be
replaced.</p>
<p>Within one day of the Department of Justice seizing several domains
in September, for example, researchers spotted 12 new websites created
to take their place. One month later, they continue to operate.</p>

American electricity consumption is growing for the first time in
generations. And though low-carbon technologies such as solar and wind
have scaled impressively over the past decade, many observers are
concerned that all this new demand will provide “a lifeline for more
fossil fuel production,” as Senator Martin Heinrich
<a href="https://www.heinrich.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/heinrich-welcomes-strong-treasury-guidance-on-45v-clean-hydrogen-tax-credit" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>put
it</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
In response, a few policy entrepreneurs have proposed novel regulations
known as “additionality” requirements to handle new sources of electric
load. First suggested for
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/hydrogen-tax-credit-rules" target="_self"><u>electrolytic
hydrogen</u></a>, additionality standards would require that subsidized
hydrogen producers source their electricity directly from newly built
low-carbon power plants; in a Heatmap piece from September, Brian Deese
and Lisa Hansmann
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/ai-additionality-framework" target="_self"><u>proposed
similar requirements</u></a> for new artificial intelligence. And while
AI data centers were their focus, the two argued that additionality “is
a model that can be extended to address other sectors facing growing
energy demand.”
</p>
<p>
There is some merit to additionality standards, particularly for
commercial customers seeking to reduce their emissions profile. But we
should be skeptical of writing these requirements into policy. Strict
federal additionality regulations will dampen investment in new
industries and electrification, reduce the efficiency of the electrical
grid through the balkanization of supply and demand, and could become
weapons as rotating government officials impose their views on which
sources of demand or supply are eligible for the standards. The grid and
the nation need a regulatory framework for energy abundance, not
burdensome additionality rules.
</p>
<p>

<p class="drop-caps">
After decades of end-use efficiency improvements, offshoring of
manufacturing, and shifts toward
<a href="https://www.newsweek.com/how-we-can-have-green-growth-increasing-human-population-prosperity-while-taking-better-care-1486342" target="_blank"><u>less
material-intensive</u></a> economies, a confluence of emerging factors
are pushing electricity demand back up again. For one, the nation is
electrifying personal vehicles, home heating, and may do the same for
industrial processes like steel production in the not-too-distant
future, sparked by a combination of policy and commercial investment.
Hydrogen, which has long been a marginal fuel, is
attracting<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/hydrogen-demand-is-set-to-boom-but-growth-faces-big-hurdles-91954056" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
<u>substantial interest</u></a>. And technological innovation is leading
to whole new sources of electric load — compute-hungry artificial
intelligence
being<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-energy-demands-water-impact-internet-hyper-consumption-era/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
<u>the most immediate example</u></a>, but also large-scale critical
minerals refining, indoor agriculture like alternative protein
cultivation and aquaculture, and so on.
</p>
<p>
In recent years, clean energy has seemed to be on an unstoppable path
toward dominating the power sector. Coal-fired generation has been in
terminal decline in the United States as natural gas power plants and
solar and wind farms have become more competitive. Flexible gas
generation, likewise, is increasingly crowded out by renewables when the
wind is blowing and the sun shining. These trends persisted in the
context of stable electricity load. But even as deployment accelerates,
low-carbon electricity supply may not be able to keep up with the
surprisingly robust growth in demand. The most obvious — though not the
exclusive — way for utilities and large corporates to meet that demand
is often with
<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/05/ai-could-drive-natural-gas-boom-as-utilities-face-surging-electric-demand.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>new
or existing natural gas capacity</u></a>. Even a few coal plants have
delayed retirement,
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/interactive/2024/data-centers-internet-power-source-coal/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reportedly</u></a>
in response to rising demand and reliability concerns.
</p>
<p>
Given the durable competitiveness of coal and especially natural gas,
some form of additionality requirement might make sense for hydrogen
production in particular, since hydrogen is not just a nascent form of
electric load but a novel fuel in its own right. Simply installing an
electrolyzer at an existing coal or natural gas plant could produce
hydrogen that, from a lifecycle perspective, would result in higher
carbon emissions, even if it displaces fossil fuels like gas or oil in
final consumption. Even so, many experts caution that
<a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/ai-additionality-wrong-solution-real-problem" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>overly
strict additionality standards</u></a> for hydrogen at this stage are
overkill, and
<a href="https://thebreakthrough.org/journal/no-20-spring-2024/two-pillars-not-three" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>may
smother the industry in its crib</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Likewise, large corporate entities and electricity customers adopting
additionality requirements for their own operations can bolster
investment in so-called “clean firm” generation like nuclear,
geothermal, and fossil fuels with carbon capture. In just the past
month, Google
<a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/energy-oil/google-nuclear-power-artificial-intelligence-87966624" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>announced
plans</u></a> to back the construction of new small nuclear reactors,
and Microsoft
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/microsoft-three-mile-island-nuclear-constellation" target="_self"><u>announced</u></a>
plans to purchase electricity for new data centers from the shuttered
Three Mile Island power plant, the plant made famous by the 1979
meltdown but which only closed down in 2019. Three Mile Island’s

price tag</u></a> would have been unthinkable just a few years ago but
is newly attractive.
</p>
<p>
Notice the problem Microsoft is trying to solve here: a lack of
abundant, reliable electricity generation.
<a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/download/?file=/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/BPC_Nuclear-Permit-License-Reform-Issue-Brief.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Outdated
technology licensing</u></a>,
<a href="https://www.thecgo.org/benchmark/much-more-than-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-nepa/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>onerous
environmental permitting processes</u></a>, and
<a href="https://www.employamerica.org/researchreports/hot-rocks-part-iii-barriers-to-next-gen-geothermal/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>other
regulatory barriers</u></a> are obstructing the deployment of
renewables, advanced nuclear energy, new enhanced geothermal
technologies, and low-carbon sources. Additionality fixes none of these
issues. Of course, Deese and Hansmann propose “a dedicated fast-track
approval process” for verifiably additional low-carbon generation
supplying new sources of AI load. Yet this should be the central effort,
not the after-the-fact add-on. The back and forth over
<a href="http://heatmap.news/economy/final-hydrogen-tax-credit-45v" target="_self"><u>additionality
rules for the clean hydrogen tax credit</u></a> is a case in point. The
rules for the tax credit will (likely) be finalized by January, but
lawsuits already loom over them. Expanding this contentious
additionality requirement to apply to broad use cases will be even more
contentious without solving the actual shortage data center companies
care about. Conversations about additionality are a distraction and
misplace the energies of policymakers and staff.
</p>
<p>
Substituting one regulatory thicket for another is a recipe for stasis.
Instead of adding more red tape, we should be working to cut through it,
fast-tracking the energy transition and fostering abundance.
</p>
<p>
With such broad requirements, what’s to stop future administrations from
expanding them to cover electric vehicle charging, electric arc furnace
steelmaking, alternative protein production, or any politically
disfavored source of new demand? Could a second Trump Administration use
additionality to punish political enemies in the tech industry? Could a
Harris Administration do the same? What if a future administration
maintained additionality standards for new sources of load, but required
that the electricity come from fossil fuels instead of low-carbon
sources?
</p>
<p>
Zero-sum regulatory contracts between sources of electricity supply and
demand are not simply at risk of becoming a tool for handing out favors
on a partisan basis — they already are one.
<a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cqsBA7RdxT2PF0ac-WMFRzJjioYe3v04" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Two
pieces of model legislation</u></a> proposed at the July meeting of the
American Legislative Exchange Council, an organization of conservative
state legislators that collaborate to write off-the-shelf legislative
measures, would require public utility commissions to prioritize
dispatchable generation and formally discourage intermittent renewable
sources like solar and wind. One of the proposals suggests leaning on
state attorneys general to extend the lifespans of coal plants
threatened with retirement.
</p>
<p>
These proposals did not move forward this year, but it is unlikely that
the motivating force behind them is exhausted. And whatever one thinks
of the relative merits of intermittent versus firm generation, ALEC’s
proposals demonstrate just how easily gamed regulations like
additionality could be and the risks of relying on administrative
discretion instead of universal, pragmatic rules.
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p class="drop-caps">
This is not how the electric grid is supposed to work. The grid is, if
not an according-to-Hoyle public good, a shared public resource,
providing essential services to customers large and small. Homeowners
don’t have to sign additionality contracts with suppliers when they buy
an electric car or replace their gas furnace with an electric heat pump.
Everyone understands that such requirements would slow the pace of
electrification and investment in new industries. The same holds for
corporate customers and novel sources of load.
</p>
<p>
The real problem facing the AI, hydrogen, nuclear, geothermal, and
renewables industries is an inability to build. There are more than
enough clean generators queueing to enter the system — 2.6 terawatts
<a href="https://emp.lbl.gov/queues" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>at
last count</u></a>, according to the Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory. The unfortunate reality, however, is that just one in five
of these projects will make it through — and those represent just 14% of
the capacity waiting to connect. Still, this totals about 360 gigawatts
of new energy generation over the next few years, much more than the
predicted demand from AI data centers. Obstacles to technology
licensing, permitting, interconnection, and transmission are the key
bottlenecks here.
</p>
<p>
Would foregoing additionality requirements and loosening regulatory
strictures on technology licensing and permitting increase the
commercial viability of new or existing fossil fuel capacity, as Deese
and Hansmann warn? Perhaps, on some margin. But for the foreseeable
future, the energy projects and infrastructure most burdened by
regulatory requirements will be low-carbon ones. Batteries, solar, and
wind projects make up more than 80% of the queue added in 2023.
Meanwhile, oil and gas benefit from categorical exclusions under the
<a href="https://ifp.org/how-nepa-will-tax-clean-energy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>National
Environmental Policy Act</u></a>, while low-carbon technologies are
subject to stricter standards (although three permitting bills recently
<a href="https://www.axios.com/pro/energy-policy/2024/09/25/drill-baby-drill-for-steam" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>passed
the House</u></a>, including one that waives these requirements for new
geothermal projects).
</p>
<p>
Consider that
<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/afb729b9-9641-42b2-97ca-93974c461c4c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>40%
of projects</u></a> supported by the Inflation Reduction Act are caught
up in delays. That is $84 billion of economic activity just waiting for
the paperwork to be figured out, according to the <em><em>Financial
Times</em></em>. Additionality requirements are additional boxes to
check that almost necessarily imply additional delays. Permitting reform
makes them redundant and unnecessary for a cleaner future.
</p>
<p>
This underscores perhaps the most essential conflict between strict
additionality requirements and clean energy abundance. Ensuring that
every new policy and every new source of demand allows for absolutely
zero additional fossil fuel consumption or emissions will prove
counterproductive to global decarbonization in the long run. Natural gas
is still reducing emissions on the margin in the United States. Over the
past decade, in years with higher natural gas prices, coal generation
has
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/coal/use-of-coal.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ticked
up</u></a>, indicating that the so-called “natural gas bridge” has not
yet reached its terminus. Even aggressive decarbonization scenarios now
expect a
<a href="https://zenodo.org/records/13345138" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>substantial
role for natural gas</u></a> over the coming decades. And in the long
term, natural gas plants may prove wholly compatible with abundant,
low-carbon electricity systems if next-generation carbon capture
technologies prove scalable.
</p>
<p>
The United States is the world’s energy technology R&amp;D and
demonstration laboratory. If policies to prune marginal fossil fuel
consumption here stall domestic investment and scaling of low-carbon
technologies — as current permitting regulations already do, and
proposed additionality requirements would do — then we will not only
slow U.S. decarbonization, but also inhibit our ability to export
affordable and scalable low-carbon technologies abroad.
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p class="drop-caps">
Environmental progress’s surest path is in speeding up. For that to
happen, we need processes that allow for rapid deployment of clean
energy solutions. Expediting technology licensing, fast-tracking federal
infrastructure permitting, and finding opportunities for quicker and
more rational interconnections should be first and foremost.
</p>
<p>
The real solution lies in building a regulatory environment where energy
abundance can flourish. Clearing the path for clean energy development,
we can achieve a future where energy is affordable, reliable, and
abundant—a future where the United States leads in both decarbonization
and economic growth. It’s time to stop adding barriers and start
speeding up progress.

id="leaf-peepers-are-flocking-to-see-new-englands-brilliant-fall-colors">Leaf-peepers
are flocking to see New England’s brilliant fall colors</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MEREDITH, N.H. — New England leaf-watching season is in full swing,
as people from as far as Florida and Berlin flock to the region for
scenic drives, train rides and bus tours to soak in the splendid hues of
red, orange and bronze. With quaint towns and covered bridges scattered
through swaths of changing forest, the rural Northeast provides an ideal
setting to view nature’s annual show.</p>
<p>“Leaf-peeping is one of the most accessible tourism things that you
can do,” said Teddy Willey, the general manager of the Frog Rock Tavern
in Meredith, New Hampshire. “You don’t have to have the athleticism to
be a hiker, you don’t have to have the money to own a boat.”</p>
<p>You just need to be able to jump in a car and head north, he
said.</p>
<p>“Once you’re there, you just take it in,” Willey said.</p>
<p>He spoke just after his tavern was flooded with tourists from Indiana
who had stepped off a sightseeing bus.</p>
<p>Among them was Vicky Boesch, of Fort Wayne, who had made the trip
with her sisters.</p>
<p>“We came out to the Northeast to see the beautiful foliage and the
colorful leaves,” she said, adding the she was impressed with
Vermont.</p>
<p>“The leaves were very pretty on the mountains because the sun was out
yesterday, and so that makes them pop more,” she said.</p>
<p>It wasn’t only the fall colors that provided a contrast with Indiana,
she said, but also the region’s distinctive architecture, lakes and
towns.</p>
<p>Gordon Cochran, of Lake View, Iowa, said he was in New Hampshire to
visit his daughter and had a “beautiful ride” on the slow-moving
Winnipesaukee Scenic Railroad.</p>
<p>Weather conditions associated with climate change have disrupted some
recent leaf-peeping seasons. One problem is that global warming has
brought drought that causes leaves to turn brown and wither before they
can reach their colorful peak.</p>
<p>Willey acknowledges that he’s not a leaf guy.</p>
<p>“Personally, no. I grew up here, so I think it loses its luster a
little bit,” he said with a chuckle, adding that the season still has
its moments.</p>
<p>“I’ll be driving somewhere around the Lakes Region, and all of a
sudden, you’re like, ‘You know what, there’s a reason why people come
here and there’s a reason I live here. It really is quite beautiful,’”
he said, referring to a scenic part of eastern New Hampshire.</p>

<h2 id="acting-us-labor-secretary-intervenes-in-boeing-strike">Acting US
labor secretary intervenes in Boeing strike</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. Acting Labor Secretary Julie Su flew to Seattle on Monday to try
to ease a Boeing machinists strike, as thousands of employees face
layoffs, and a major airline reacted with alarm to the plane maker’s
deepening turmoil. </p>
<p>Su’s first in-person intervention, reported by Reuters and confirmed
by the Labor Department, comes days after Boeing — dealing with a
crippling strike now in its fifth week — unveiled plans to cut 17,000
jobs and take $5 billion in charges, continuing a year of tumult for the
company. </p>
<p>“Acting Secretary Su is meeting with both parties today to assess the
situation and encourage both parties to move forward in the bargaining
process,” a spokesperson said. </p>
<p>While Su has previously spoken with Boeing and the union, it is her
first time in Seattle meeting both sides in person, the spokesperson
said. </p>
<p>Roughly 33,000 workers have been on strike since September 13,
seeking a 40% wage increase and the restoration of a defined-benefit
pension they agreed to give up in 2014.   </p>
<p>The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers was
not immediately available for comment. Boeing and a White House
spokesperson declined to comment. </p>
<p>Shares of the aerospace giant fell 1.3% to close Monday at $148.99,
following the company’s surprise after-hours announcement Friday, which
also included a new delay to the 777X jetliner and the ending of civil
767 freighter production. </p>
<p>Boeing will hold meetings this week to lay out detailed plans, having
given few specifics in Friday’s announcement, industry sources said. The
company also expects a quarterly cash burn of about $1.3 billion, better
than anticipated, but still the third consecutive quarter it has burned
through cash. </p>
<p>Boeing will next month send out 60-day notices to thousands of
workers in its commercial aviation division, meaning those staff will
leave the company in mid-January, one source familiar with the matter
said. </p>
<p>A second phase of notices, if more redundancies are required, would
be rolled out in December, the source said. </p>
<p>A spokesperson for the Society of Professional Engineering Employees
in Aerospace, which represents engineers at Boeing, said the company
informed the union Monday that 60-day notices to their members would be
issued on November 15. </p>
<p>Boeing is expected to refrain from asking for voluntary departures to
limit severance cash and avoid an exodus of skills, sources said, adding
the company will rely mainly on involuntary layoffs. Rivals are scooping
up scarce labor to relieve pressure on aerospace supply chains. </p>
<p>“The trick will be not losing the 10% of people you want to keep,
which is even more important than usual in the post-pandemic skill
shortage environment,” said Agency Partners analyst Nick
Cunningham. </p>
<p>Industry alarm </p>
<p>The one-year delay in 777X deliveries to 2026 was widely expected in
the industry and brings the lag in delivery of the 777 mini-jumbo
successor to six years amid certification and testing delays. </p>
<p>Emirates Airline President Tim Clark, whose initial order for 150
jets helped launch the world’s largest twin-engine jet more than a
decade ago, hinted at commercial repercussions.   </p>
<p>“We will be having a serious conversation with them over the next
couple of months,” he said in a statement. “I fail to see how Boeing can
make any meaningful forecasts of delivery dates.” </p>
<p>He also became the first senior industry figure to articulate fears,
whispered privately by some industry leaders in recent weeks, over
Boeing’s ability to tackle its worst-ever crisis intact. </p>
<p>“Unless the company is able to raise funds through a rights issue, I
see an imminent investment downgrade with Chapter 11 looming on the
horizon,” Clark told the Air Current aviation news service. </p>
<p>Emirates is the largest user of the 777 jet family, a long-distance
workhorse whose original success has been clouded by delays to its
successor and the crisis engulfing Boeing’s smaller 737 cash cow over
safety and quality issues. </p>
<p>Friday’s package of announcements showed Boeing has just over $10
billion of gross cash, a much-touted level that analysts said would ease
some near-term pressure, though the company still needs to raise money
by year’s end, they said. </p>
<p>Most analysts expect Boeing to be able to raise up to $15 billion
through a share issue. But major airlines’ perception of Boeing’s
financial risk remains a sensitive topic, as many have billions of
dollars of deposits sitting with the plane maker — an exposure some
already want to limit because of delays, industry sources say. </p>
<p>Boeing declined to comment on Clark’s remarks. </p>
<p>Ratings agency S&amp;P has warned Boeing risks losing its prized
investment-grade credit rating. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of the Army Christine Wormuth said Monday
that recent layoff announcements were not expected to disrupt its
programs, which include helicopters and munitions.</p>

of pro-Palestinian protesters arrested outside New York Stock
Exchange</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — About 200 demonstrators protesting Israel’s war in Gaza
were arrested in a sit-in outside the New York Stock Exchange on Monday,
police said. </p>
<p>The protesters chanted “Let Gaza live!” And “Up up with liberation,
down down with occupation!” in front of the stock exchange’s landmark
building in lower Manhattan. </p>
<p>“The reason we’re here is to demand that the U.S. government stop
sending bombs to Israel and stop profiting off of Israel’s genocide
against Palestinians in Gaza,” said Beth Miller, political director of
Jewish Voice for Peace, the group that organized the demonstration.
“Because what’s been happening for the last year is that Israel is using
U.S. bombs to massacre communities in Gaza while simultaneously weapons
manufacturers on Wall Street are seeing their stock prices
skyrocket.” </p>
<p>A handful of counter protesters waved Israeli flags and tried to
shout down the pro-Palestinian chants. </p>
<p>None of the pro-Palestinian protesters got inside the exchange, but
at least 200 made it inside a security fence on Broad Street, where they
sat down and waited to be taken into custody. </p>
<p>A spokesperson for the exchange declined to comment on the
protest. </p>
<p>Police arrested the protesters one by one, cuffing their hands behind
their backs with plastic ties and leading them to vans. Some
demonstrators went limp and were carried by three or four officers. </p>
<p>A police spokesperson said there were about 200 arrests. She did not
have details on the charges they faced. </p>
<p>The protest happened a week after the world marked the anniversary of
Hamas’ surprise Oct. 7 attack on Israel and the start of Israel’s
retaliatory campaign in Gaza, which has since spread to Lebanon and
beyond. </p>
<p>The Lebanese Red Cross said an Israeli airstrike hit an apartment
building in northern Lebanon on Monday, killing at least 21 people. </p>
<p>There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, and it was
not clear what the target was.</p>

campaign crowdfunded millions online in untraditional approach to
emergency relief</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Former President Donald Trump’s campaign is using GoFundMe
to rally its network of deep-pocketed backers and everyday donors around
the survivors of his July assassination attempt and Hurricane Helene’s
destruction, bucking more traditional avenues of emergency relief. </p>
<p>The two high-profile fundraisers — organized by the Republican
nominee’s national finance director — have drawn more than $14 million.
They do not violate campaign finance laws, according to legal experts.
Nor is the campaign allowed to pocket any proceeds for its own political
ends; a GoFundMe spokesperson told The Associated Press that the
majority of the Butler, Pennsylvania, funds have been disbursed. </p>
<p>But the use of a crowdfunding platform marks an unorthodox response
to crises from a political campaign. Never before has a major party’s
presidential candidate turned to the for-profit company — which usually
features desperate appeals for help covering tuition costs or medical
bills — to mobilize their base toward outside charitable causes. </p>
<p>“It’s pretty unusual and actually quite odd,” said Brett Kappel, a
longtime campaign finance attorney with Harmon Curran who has advised
both Republicans and Democrats. </p>
<p>It’s more typical to see candidates contribute campaign funds to
IRS-approved nonprofits during natural disasters, Kappel said. He
pointed to Federal Election Commission filings that show U.S. Senator
Tim Scott’s 2022 campaign gave to the American Red Cross after Hurricane
Ian hit South Carolina. </p>
<p>Trump campaign spokesperson Brian Hughes said the motivation arose
from “the president wanting to help find a way for his supporters to
give as much direct support as they can.” </p>
<p>The finance team only got involved because of their “great expertise
in working with large accounts,” according to Hughes, and “not one penny
of this funding is going anywhere but to those impacted.” Hughes said
more than $6.5 million of the $7.7 million raised for organizations
helping with Hurricane Helene recovery had been disbursed as of
Oct. 11. </p>
<p>“The president has an amazing movement of supporters,” Hughes told
AP. “With the experience in Butler generating millions of dollars of
support, he saw the same opportunity to be a direct conduit for a
philanthropic effort from his supporters.” </p>
<p>Longtime Trump associates, conservative celebrities and right-wing
groups gave tens of thousands of dollars. Bill Ackman, the CEO of the
Pershing Square investment firm who endorsed Trump shortly after the
assassination attempt, donated $100,000 for hurricane relief. UFC
President Dana White also pitched in $100,000. Republican U.S. Senator
Rick Scott said on X that he donated $50,000 from his congressional
salary for the Butler, Pennsylvania victims. Also contributing was The
Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank behind Project
2025. </p>
<p>GoFundMe collects a transaction fee of 2.9% plus 30 cents for every
donation to cover credit and debit charges. Its global Trust &amp;
Safety team has been communicating closely with organizer Meredith
O’Rourke to ensure the safe distribution of donations from the Butler,
Pennsylvania, page, according to a company spokesperson. O’Rourke also
provided a verified distribution plan, the GoFundMe spokesperson told
AP, which the company routinely requires in cases where organizers are
withdrawing money on behalf of other recipients. </p>
<p>Lawyer advises against </p>
<p>It’s not advisable for campaign finance officials to run crowdfunding
pages “at the same time they were writing your money for your camp,”
said Andrew Herman, a Washington lawyer specializing in campaign
finance. Because online crowdfunding is less regulated, he said, it
would’ve been “more palatable” to direct supporters toward a recognized
nonprofit. </p>
<p>“But people get into trouble when they try to ascribe rationality or
any degree of what we would generally consider best financial practices
to campaigns,” Herman said. </p>
<p>“There’s no black letter law that says they can’t do this,” he added.
“Should they? Of course not.” </p>
<p>The bulk of the Pennsylvania disbursements were made earlier this
month, and more payouts will come while the page remains active,
according to Hughes. The “vast majority” has gone to the families of the
three people shot, he said. Some funds also compensated a local crane
rental company after the owner said he lost business when the ensuing
police investigation left him unable to retrieve equipment he’d donated
for the rally. </p>
<p>Money raised for Hurricane Helene victims has gone to four
nonprofits. Samaritan’s Purse spokesperson Gabrielle Bouquet said the
Christian humanitarian aid organization is grateful for Trump’s
“steadfast support of the work we do in Jesus’ name.” Bouquet declined
to share the exact amount of the donation. </p>
<p>Water Mission, a Christian engineering nonprofit that builds safe
water solutions in disaster areas, confirmed that the South
Carolina-based ministry had also received funds. Public relations
director Gregg Dinino did not specify the total. </p>
<p>Mtn2Sea Ministries, which delivers generators and supplies in the
immediate aftermath of weather events, said on Facebook that it received
$25,000 on Monday. The disaster relief group posted that the proceeds
were used to buy South Georgia businesses’ gift cards because “the best
way to help those in need is to get resources directly into their
hands.” </p>
<p>‘Combustible dynamic’ </p>
<p>It makes sense that Trump’s team gravitated toward crowdfunding, said
Benjamin Soskis of the Urban Institute’s Center on Nonprofits and
Philanthropy. The campaign “has often been premised on a suspicion of
institutions,” he said, and GoFundMe “drew some of its attraction by
serving as an alternative to institutional charitable giving.” </p>
<p>But crowdfunding also brings less accountability, Soskis said.
Crowdfunding pages don’t have the same disclosure requirements as public
charities that must divulge their finances in annual tax filings. </p>
<p>Soskis said Trump’s checkered philanthropic ventures have likely
brought increased levels of scrutiny. A judge fined Trump $2 million in
2019 for using his since-dissolved charitable foundation to advance his
interests. </p>
<p>“It is a combustible dynamic when you combine campaigning and
charitable giving,” Soskis said. “The extra dynamics of crowdfunding and
Trump’s own history with philanthropy itself adds more fuel to that
fire.”</p>

Latest Nobel Winner Has a Different Approach to Solving Climate
Change</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-14, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzgxMzg2OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2NDY1OTA3NH0.SIQRUwklku7chDrVyRMYxIbq_hT-3f5TxfUig1CFhWQ/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
This year’s Economics Nobel is not a climate prize — that happened in
2018, when Yale economist William Nordhaus won the prize for his work on
modeling the effects of climate change and economic growth together,
providing the intellectual basis for carbon taxation and more generally
for regulating greenhouse gas emissions because of the “social cost”
they impose on everyone.
</p>
<p>
Instead, this year’s prize, awarded to MIT’s Daron Acemoglu and Simon
Johnson and University of Chicago’s James Robinson is for their work
demonstrating “the importance of societal institutions for a country’s
prosperity,” i.e. why some countries are rich and others are poor. To do
so, the trio looked at the history of those countries’ institutions —
laws, modes of government, relationship between the state and
individuals — and drew out which are conducive to wealth and which lead
to poverty.
</p>
<p>
Long story short, “extractive” institutions set up to reward a narrow
elite tend to hurt economic development over time, as in
<a href="https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/publications/colonial-origins-of-comparative-development.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>much
of Africa</u></a>, which was colonized by Europeans who didn’t actually
live there. “Inclusive” institutions, by contrast, arose in the United
States and Canada, where there was significantly more European
migration, thus incentivizing the ruling elite to set up institutions
that benefitted a broader range of (again, European) residents.
</p>
<p>
While this research rests heavily on <em><em>the climate</em></em> (the
reason Europeans avoided African colonies was because of the high rate
of disease in tropical climates), it does not touch on <em><em>climate
change</em></em> specifically. But Acemoglu especially is an incredibly
wide-ranging scholar and has devoted some time to the specific questions
of climate change — and in so doing has been a direct critic of
Nordhaus, Stockholm’s preferred climate economist.
</p>
<p>
“Existing approaches in economics still do not provide the right
framework for managing the problems that will confront us over the next
several decades,”
<a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/magazine/what-climate-change-requires-of-economics-by-daron-acemoglu-2021-09" target="_blank"><u>Acemoglu
wrote</u></a> in a 2021 essay titled “What Climate Change Requires of
Economics,” referring directly to Nordhaus’s Nobel-winning work.
“Although the economics discipline has evolved over time to acknowledge
environmental risks and costs, it has yet to rise to the challenge of
climate change. A problem as massive as this one will require a
fundamental reconsideration of some of the field’s most deeply held
assumptions.”
</p>
<p>
His criticisms included that Nordhaus’s more gradualistic approach —
<a href="https://economics.yale.edu/sites/default/files/2024-03/barrage-nordhaus-2024-policies-projections-and-the-social-cost-of-carbon-results-from-the-dice-2023-model.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
latest version of his model</u></a> spits out that a 1.5 degree Celsius
warming target is “infeasible,” and the “cost vs. benefit optimal”
amount of warming as 2.6 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels with
a carbon price that rises to $115 per ton by 2050 — ignores both the
best way to reduce emissions and the risk of not doing so fast enough.
</p>
<p>
Acemoglu is far more optimistic about how policy can direct
technological development and less sanguine about additional warming
over and above the Paris Agreement limits. He argues that the
possibility of theoretical
“<a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-nine-tipping-points-that-could-be-triggered-by-climate-change/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>tipping
points</u></a>,” where exceeding
<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0Eb4u07ljUreXRyc2NnRXQ5RkE/view?resourcekey=0-LT7b_pQG5krLrO6DU5yKlg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>certain
climate thresholds</u></a> by even a small amount may cause dramatic
damages, make the risk of such overshoot far too great.
</p>
<p>
He also took issue with the discount rate applied to spending later
vs. spending now in Nordhaus’s models. The basic idea is that a dollar
spent today to mitigate the effects of climate change is more valuable
than one spent in 2050. But the rates Nordhaus uses — which he derives
from real-world investment returns — implies that in order for spending
now to be worth it later, the benefits in 2050 or 2100 must be very,
very large.
</p>
<p>
“There is a plausible economic (and philosophical) case to be made for
why future essential public goods should be valued differently than
private goods or other types of public consumption,” Acemoglu wrote in
2021, arguing that discount rates derived from investment returns,
<a href="https://eplanning.blm.gov/public_projects/nepa/119017/175400/213681/Exhibit_20_Nordhaus_PNAS_2017-1518-23.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>like
the ones Nordhaus uses</u></a>, might not be the best guide to public
policy.
</p>
<p>
So what does the latest Nobel laureate want instead? Well, something
like what the United States has been doing the past few
years.<br/><br/>Accounting for the economic benefits of domestic or
“endogenous” technological development, Acemoglu’s research finds that
“the transition to cleaner energy is much more important than simply
reducing energy consumption, and that technological interventions need
to be redirected far more aggressively than they have been.” He explored
how this process could work in papers he wrote over more than a decade,
developing a model for this kind of directed technological change and
applying it to the United States, starting as far back as 2012.
</p>
<p>
Across all his work on climate change, Acemoglu argues that a focus on
pricing the “externalities” of carbon emissions — the harm emissions
impose on everyone that isn’t reflected in the prices of fossil fuels —
is myopic. Instead, the challenge is both restricting emissions
<em><em>and</em></em> fostering clean technologies that can take the
place of dirty ones, which have had a remarkable head start in
investment.
</p>
<p>
In
“<a href="https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/publications/The%20Environment%20and%20Directed%20Technical%20Change.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>The
Environment and Directed Technical Change</u></a>,” published in 2012
and co-written with Philippe Aghion, Leonardo Bursztyn, and David
Hemous, Acemoglu argues that a mixture of carbon taxes and research
subsides could “redirect technical change and avoid an environmental
disaster” by imposing a cost on dirty technology and boosting clean
technology.<br/><br/>Such an approach would probably rest heavily on
positive subsidies and encouraging clean technology and less on a carbon
tax, the four write (although a carbon tax would still help to
“discourage research” into polluting technologies). It would also need
to happen soon.
</p>
<p>
“Directed technical change also calls for immediate and decisive action
in contrast to the implications of several exogenous technology models
used in previous economic analyses.”
</p>
<p>
This framework does not precisely match United States policy — we have
no carbon tax — but it does somewhat approximate it. The Biden
administration’s approach to climate policy centers on large-scale
investments in clean technologies, whether they’re tax credits for
non-carbon-emitting electricity production or financing for clean energy
projects from the Loan Programs Office, combined with a suite of
Environmental Protection Agency rules that are intended to reduce
pollution from fossil fuel power plants (along with an actual direct fee
on methane emissions).
</p>
<p>
This approach is embedded within an overall industrial policy that’s
supposed to make the economy more productive — a counter-argument to the
idea that climate spending is an economic drag that trades off with
environmental harms in the future. Acemoglu, too, questions the idea
that there’s a tradeoff between economic growth and spending to combat
climate change. Not only could renewables be cheaper than fossil fuels,
“an energy transition can improve productive capacity and thus lead to
an expansion of output, because transition to cleaner technologies can
boost investment and the rate of technological progress,” he and his
co-authors write.
</p>
<p>
Acemoglu has also weighed in on one the more controversial questions in
climate policy and economics: the shale gas boom.
<a href="https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/2023-08/Climate%20Change%2C%20Directed%20Innovation%2C%20and%20Energy%20Transistion%20-%20The%20Long-run%20Consequences%20of%20the%20Shale%20Gas%20Revolution.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>In
a 2023 paper</u></a> written, again with Aghion, Hemous, and Lint
Barrage, he weighed the effects of dramatic increase of domestically
extracted natural gas, focusing on the importance of technological
development. The Environmental Protection Agency attributes the decline
in US greenhouse gas emissions since 2010
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>in
part to</u></a> “the growing use of natural gas and renewables to
generate electricity in place of more carbon-intensive fuels,” due to
natural gas replacing coal electricity generation. While this logic has
come under fire from
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/lng-exports-pause-biden-emissions" target="_self"><u>some
activists and researchers</u></a> who say the government’s models
underestimate methane leakage from natural gas operations, Acemoglu took
a different tack.
</p>
<p>
Yes, natural gas substituting for coal reduces short-run emissions, he
and his co-authors concluded, but also, “the natural gas boom
discourages innovation directed at clean energy, which delays and can
even permanently prevent the energy transition to zero carbon.” They
backed up this assertion by pointing to a decline in the total share of
patents rewarded to renewable energy innovation between 2009 and 2016.
</p>
<p>
The way out is that same mix of carbon prices and technology subsidies
Acemoglu has been recommending in some form since
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn676-fLq7I" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Kelly
Clarkson was last on top of the charts</u></a>, which “enables emission
reductions in the short run, while optimal policy would ensure that the
long-run green transition is not disrupted.”
</p>
<p>
If the Biden Administration’s climate policy works out, it will look
something like that, and the prize will be far greater than anything
given out in Stockholm.

National Zoo set to welcome new pair of pandas from China</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The National Zoo’s long dark panda drought seems to be coming to an
end. </p>
<p>Eleven months after the zoo sent its three wildly popular pandas —
Mei Xiang, Tian Tian and their cub Xiao Qi Ji — back to China, a new
pair of bears is set to arrive. </p>
<p>A pair of 3-year-old giant pandas, named Bao Li and Qing Bao, have
left a research facility in the southwestern Chinese city of Dujiangyan
and will soon be flown to Washington, according to a statement by the
China Wildlife Conservation Association. </p>
<p>“Food prepared for the trip includes corn bread, bamboo and carrots,
as well as water and medicine,” the statement said, adding that the
partnership will “make new contributions in protecting global
biodiversity and enhance the friendship of the people from the two
countries.” </p>
<p>It’s unclear exactly when the bears will arrive in Washington, but
there will likely be an extended quarantine and acclimation period
before they are introduced to the public. </p>
<p>Bao Li (precious vigor) and Qing Bao (green treasure) arrive in
Washington as part of a new 10-year exchange agreement with Chinese
authorities. The previous agreement expired last year, leading to some
concern among American panda lovers that Beijing was gradually pulling
its iconic furry friendship ambassadors from American zoos amid rising
diplomatic tensions.</p>

id="lilly-ledbetter-american-icon-of-the-fight-for-equal-pay-dies-at-86">Lilly
Ledbetter, American icon of the fight for equal pay, dies at 86</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — Lilly Ledbetter, an former Alabama factory manager whose
lawsuit against her employer made her an icon of the equal pay movement
and led to landmark wage discrimination legislation, has died at 86.</p>
<p>Ledbetter’s discovery that she was earning less than her male
counterparts for doing the same job at a Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber
Co. plant in Alabama led to her lawsuit, which ultimately failed when
the Supreme Court ruled in 2007 that she had filed her complaint too
late. The court ruled that workers must file lawsuits within six months
of first receiving a discriminatory paycheck — in Ledbetter’s case,
years before she learned about the disparity through an anonymous
letter.</p>
<p>Two years later, former President Barack Obama signed into the law
the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which gave workers the right to sue
within 180 days of receiving each discrimination paycheck, not just the
first one.</p>
<p>“Lilly Ledbetter never set out to be a trailblazer or a household
name. She just wanted to be paid the same as a man for her hard work,”
Obama said in a statement Monday. “Lilly did what so many Americans
before her have done: setting her sights high for herself and even
higher for her children and grandchildren.”</p>
<p>Ledbetter died Saturday of respiratory failure, according to a
statement from her family cited by the Alabama news site AL.com.</p>
<p>Ledbetter continued campaigning for equal pay for decades after
winning the law named after her. A film about her life starring Patricia
Clarkson premiered last week at the Hamptons International Film
Festival.</p>
<p>The team behind the film, “LILLY,” issued a statement of condolence
on social media.</p>
<p>“Lilly was an ordinary woman who achieved extraordinary things, and
her story continues to motivate us all. We will miss her,” the team
said.</p>
<p>In January, President Joe Biden marked the 15th anniversary of the
law named after Ledbetter with new measures to help close the gender
wage gap, including a new rule barring the federal government from
considering a person’s current or past pay when determining their
salary.</p>
<p>Ledbetter had advocated for the measure in a January opinion piece
for Ms. Magazine penned with Deborah Vagins, director of the Equal Pay
Today advocacy group. But Ledbetter and other advocates for years have
been frustrated that more comprehensive initiatives have stalled,
including the Paycheck Fairness Act, which would strengthen the Equal
Pay Act of 1963.</p>
<p>The sense of urgency among advocates deepened after an annual report
from the Census Bureau last month found that the gender wage gap between
men and women widened for the first time 20 years. In 2023, women
working full time earned 83 cents on the dollar compared with men, down
from 84 cents in 2022.</p>
<p>Even before then, advocates had been frustrated that wage gap
improvement had mostly stalled for the last 20 years despite women
making gains in the C-suite and earning college degrees at a faster rate
than men. Experts say the reasons for the enduring gap are multifaceted,
including the overrepresentation of women in lower-paying industries and
weak childcare system that pushes many women to step back from their
careers in their peak earnings years.</p>
<p>In 2018, at the height of the #MeToo movement, Ledbetter wrote a
opinion piece in The New York Times detailing the harassment she faced
as a manager at the Goodyear factory and drawing a link between
workplace sexual harassment and pay discrimination.</p>
<p>“She was indefatigable,” said Emily Martin, chief program officer at
the National Women’s Law Center, which worked closely with Ledbetter.
“She was always ready to lend her voice, to show up to do a video, to
write an op-ed. She was always ready to go.”</p>
<p>Ledbetter was a manager at the Goodyear plant in Gadsden, Alabama,
and had worked there 19 years when she received an anonymous note saying
she was being paid significantly less than three male colleagues.</p>
<p>She filed a lawsuit in 1999 and initially won $3.8 million in backpay
and damages from a federal court. She never received the money after

Zillow’s Climate Risk Data?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-14, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzgwNjEyOC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczMzg2NzA0MX0.IuTgnZtC9B-bQRjBXhSdkhjA_3RtXxsbltebzvPLUkc/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Starting this month, the tens of millions of Americans who browse the
real-estate listings website Zillow will encounter a new type of
information.
</p>
<p>
In addition to disclosing a home’s square footage, school district, and
walkability score, Zillow will begin to tell users about its
<em><em>climate risk </em></em>— the chance that a major weather or
climate event will strike in the next 30 years. It will focus on the
risk from five types of dangers: floods, wildfires, high winds, heat,
and air quality.
</p>
<p>
The data has the potential to transform how Americans think about buying
a home, especially because climate change will likely worsen many of
those dangers. About 70% of Americans look at Zillow at some point
during the process of buying a home,
<a href="https://www.zillow.com/z/corp/about/#:~:text=Zillow's%20ecosystem%20of%20products%20and,some%20point%20in%20their%20transaction." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>according
to the company</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
“Climate risks are now a critical factor in home-buying decisions,”
Skylar Olsen, Zillow’s chief economist, said in a statement. “Healthy
markets are ones where buyers and sellers have access to all relevant
data for their decisions.”
</p>
<p>
That’s true — if the information is accurate. But can homebuyers
actually trust Zillow’s climate risk data? When climate experts have
looked closely at the underlying data Zillow uses to assess climate
risk, they have walked away unconvinced.
</p>
<p>
Zillow’s climate risk data comes from
<a href="https://firststreet.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>First
Street Technology</u></a>, a New York-based company that uses computer
models to estimate the risk that weather and climate change pose to
homes and buildings. It is far and away the most prominent company
focused on modeling the physical risks of climate change. (Although it
was initially established as a nonprofit foundation,
<a href="https://firststreet.org/press/first-street-announces-new-structure-investment-partners-and-advisor" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">First
Street <u>reorganized</u></a> as a for-profit company and
<a href="https://firststreet.org/press/first-street-finalizes-a-46-million-series-a-to-scale-breakthrough-advancements-in-physical-climate-risk-modeling" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>accepted</u></a>
$46 million in investment earlier this year.)
</p>
<p>
But few experts believe that tools like First Street’s are capable of
actually modeling the dangers of climate change at a
property-by-property level. A report from a team of White House
scientific advisors
<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/PCAST_Extreme-Weather-Report_April2023.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>concluded</u></a>
last year that these models are of “questionable quality,” and a
<em><em>Bloomberg </em></em>investigation
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2024-flood-fire-climate-risk-analytics/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>found</u></a>
that different climate risk models could return wildly different
catastrophe estimates for the same property.

</p>
<p>
Not all of First Street’s data is seen as equally suspect. Its estimates
of heat and air pollution risk have generally attracted less criticism
from experts. But its estimates of flooding and wildfire risk — which
are the most catastrophic events for homeowners — are generally thought
to be inadequate at best.
</p>
<p>
So while Zillow will soon tell you with seeming precision that a certain
home has a 1.1% chance of facing a wildfire in the next 30 years,
potential homebuyers should take that kind of estimate with “a lot of
grains of salt,” Michael Wara, a senior research scholar at the Stanford
Woods Institute for the Environment, told me.
</p>
<p>
Here’s a short guide for how to think through Zillow’s estimates of
climate risk.
</p>
<p>
Neither First Street nor Zillow immediately responded to requests for
comment.
</p>
<h3>
If Zillow tells you a property has flooded recently, take it seriously.
</h3>
<p>
Zillow has said that, when the data is available, it will tell users
whether a given home has flooded or burned in a wildfire recently. (It
will also say whether a home is near a source of air pollution.)
</p>
<p>
Homebuyers should take that information seriously,
<a href="https://www.bu.edu/law/profile/madison-condon/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Madison
Condon</u></a>, a Boston University School of Law professor who studies
climate change and financial markets, told me.
</p>
<p>
“If the house flooded in the recent past, then that should be a major
red flag to you,” she said. Houses that have flooded recently are very
likely to flood again, she said.
<a href="https://www.nrdc.org/bio/joel-scata/growing-nationwide-trend-states-requiring-flood-disclosure#:~:text=Since%202018%2C%2010%20states%20(Florida,their%20flood%20risk%20disclosure%20laws." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Only
10 states</u></a> require a home seller to disclose a flood to a
potential buyer.
</p>
<h3>
Use Zillow’s flood risk assessment as a starting place — but contact the
local government to learn more.
</h3>
<p>
First Street claims that its physics-based models can identify the risk
that any individual property will flood. But the ability to determine
whether a given house will flood depends on having an intricate
knowledge of local infrastructure, including stormwater drains and what
exists on other properties, and that data does not seem to exist in
anyone’s model at the moment, Condon said.
</p>
<p>
When <em><em>Bloomberg</em></em>
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2024-flood-fire-climate-risk-analytics/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>compared</u></a>
the output of three different flooding models, including First Street’s,
they agreed on results for only 5% of properties.
</p>
<p>
If you’re worried about a home’s flood risk, then contact the local
government and see if you can look at a flood map or even talk to a
flood manager, Condon said. Many towns and cities keep flood maps in
their records or on their website that are more granular than what First
Street is capable of, she said.
</p>
<p>
“The local flood manager who has walked the property will almost always
have a better grasp of flood risk than the big, top-down national
model,” she said.
</p>
<h3>
Don’t hesitate to buy flood insurance.
</h3>
<p>
In some cases, Zillow will recommend that a home buyer purchase federal
flood insurance. That’s generally not a bad idea, Condon said, even if
Zillow reaches that conclusion using national model data that has errors
or mistakes.
</p>
<p>
“It simply is true that way more people should be buying flood insurance
than generally think they should,” she said. “So a general
overcorrection on that would be good.”
</p>
<h3>
Zillow probably underestimates a home’s wildfire risk, especially out
west.
</h3>
<p>
If you’re looking at buying a home in a wildfire-prone area, especially
in the American West, then you should generally assume that Zillow is
underestimating its wildfire risk, Wara, the Stanford researcher, told
me.
</p>
<p>
That’s because computer models that estimate wildfire risk are in a
fairly early stage of development and improving rapidly. Even the best
academic simulations lack the kind of granular, structure-level data
that would allow them to predict a property’s forward-looking wildfire
risk.
</p>
<p>
That is actually a bigger problem for homebuyers than for insurance
companies, he said. A home insurance company gets to decide whether to
insure a property every year. If it looks at new science and concludes
that a given town or structure is too risky, then it can raise its
premiums or even simply decline to cover a property at all. (State Farm
<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/state-farm-halts-home-insurance-sales-in-california-5748c771" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>stopped</u></a>
selling home insurance policies in California last year, partly because
of wildfire risk.)
</p>
<p>
But when homeowners buy a house, their lives and their wealth get locked
into that property for 30 years. “Maybe your kids are going to the
school district,” he said. It’s much harder to sell a home when you
can’t get it covered. “You have an illiquid asset, and it’s a lot harder
to move.”
</p>
<p>
That means First Street’s wildfire risk data should be taken as
“absolute minimum estimate,” Wara said. In a wildfire-prone area, “the
real risk is most likely much higher” than its models say.
</p>
<h3>
Wildfire models are especially bad at predicting the most destructive
types of fires.
</h3>
<p>
Over the past several years, runaway wildland fires have killed dozens
of people or destroyed tens of thousands of homes in
<a href="https://lahainatown.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Lahaina,
Hawaii</u></a>;
<a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/11/09/777801169/the-camp-fire-destroyed-11-000-homes-a-year-later-only-11-have-been-rebuilt" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Paradise,
California</u></a>; and
<a href="https://research.noaa.gov/2024/01/08/looking-back-at-colorados-marshall-fire/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Marshall,
Colorado</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
But in those cases, once the fire began incinerating homes, it ceased to
be a wildland fire and became a structure-to-structure fire. The fire
began to leap from house to house like a book of matches, condemning
entire neighborhoods to burn within minutes.
</p>
<p>
Modern computer models do an especially poor job of simulating that
transition — the moment when a wildland fire becomes an urban
conflagration, Wara said. Although it only happens in perhaps 0.5% of
the most intense fires, those fires are responsible for destroying the
most homes.
</p>
<p>
But “how that happens and how to prevent that is not well understood
yet,” he said. “And if they’re not well understood yet from a scientific
perspective, that means it’s not in the [First Street] model.”
</p>
<p>
Nor do the best university wildfire models have good data on every
individual property’s structural-level details — such as what material
its walls or roof
<a href="https://www.nifc.gov/fire-information/fire-prevention-education-mitigation/wildfire-mitigation/home" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>are
made of</u></a> — that would make it susceptible to fire.
</p>
<h3>
Your whole neighborhood matters when assessing flood or wildfire risk.
</h3>
<p>
When assessing whether your home faces wildfire risk, its structure is
very important. But “you have to know what your neighbor’s houses look
like, too, within about a 250-yard radius. So that’s your whole
neighborhood,” Wara said. “I don’t think anyone has that data.”
</p>
<p>
A similar principle goes for thinking about flood risk, Condon said.
Your home might not flood, she said, but it also matters whether the
roads to your house are still driveable or whether the power lines fail.
“It’s not particularly useful to have a flood-resilient home if your
whole neighborhood gets washed out,” she said.
</p>
<p>
Experts agree that the most important interventions to discourage
wildfire — or, for that matter, floods — have to happen at the community
level. Although few communities are doing prescribed burns or fuel
reduction programs right now, some are, Wara said.
</p>
<p>
But because nobody is collecting data about those programs, national
risk models like First Street’s would not factor those programs into an
area’s wildfire risk, he said. (In the rare case that a government
is<em> </em>clearing fuel or doing a prescribed burn around a town,
wildfire risk there might actually be lower than Zillow says, Wara
added.)
</p>
<p>
Going forward, figuring out a property’s climate risk — much like
pushing for community-level resilience investment — shouldn’t be left up
to individuals, Condon said.
</p>
<p>
The state of California
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/california-to-explore-first-in-nation-public-wildfire-catastrophe-model/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>is
investing</u></a> in a public wildfire catastrophe model so that it can
figure out which homes and towns face the highest risk. She said that
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the federal entities that buy home
mortgages, could invest in their own internal climate-risk assessments
to build the public’s capacity to understand climate risk.
</p>
<p>
“I would advocate for this not to be an every-man-for-himself,
every-consumer-has-to-make-a-decision situation,” Condon said.

Trump campaigning in battleground Pennsylvania Monday</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Harrisburg, Pennsylvania — Vice President Kamala Harris and former
President Donald Trump will take their fight for Pennsylvania to
opposite ends of the state on Monday, with Harris speaking in the
northwest corner in Erie and Trump in the southeastern suburbs of
Philadelphia.</p>
<p>Democrat Harris and Republican Trump have been making regular
appearances in what is the country’s largest battleground state — it
will be Harris’ 10th visit to Pennsylvania this campaign season, and
just last week Trump made stops in both Scranton and Reading.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania’s energy industry and natural gas fracking are likely
topics as they compete for the fraction of the state’s voters who have
not made up their minds. Mail-in voting is well underway in the state
where some 7 million people are likely to cast votes in the presidential
race.</p>
<p>Trump beat Hillary Clinton by more than 40,000 votes in Pennsylvania
on his way to winning the presidency in 2016, but native Scrantonian Joe
Biden beat Trump by about 80,000 votes in the state four years ago.</p>
<p>Harris will be holding a rally in Erie, a Democratic majority city of
about 94,000 people bordered by suburbs and rural areas with significant
numbers of Republicans. Erie County is often cited as one of the state’s
reliable bellwether regions, where the electorate has a decidedly
moderate voting record. Trump visited Erie on Sept. 29.</p>
<p>Harris plans to talk up early voting during her rally. And she’ll
stop by a Black-owned small business in Erie in advance of the rally to
promote her proposals to give Black men more economic opportunities and
other chances to thrive as Democrats try to energize the voting
bloc.</p>
<p>Trump plans a town hall Monday at the Greater Philadelphia Expo
Center and Fairgrounds in suburban Oaks, hoping to drive up turnout
among his supporters.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania and its 19 electoral votes, the most of any swing state,
have generated the most attention by far from the Democratic and
Republican presidential campaigns. Including Monday’s scheduled events,
they will have made 46 stops in the state, according to Associated Press
tracking of the campaigns’ public events.</p>
<p>Michigan, with 33 visits, and Wisconsin, with 29, are the next
most-visited states, illustrating how both campaigns are focusing on
winning states that had been part of the Democrats’ so-called “blue
wall” until Trump emerged as the Republican standard-bearer.</p>
<p>Democrats have won three straight elections for governor, and both
current U.S. senators are Democrats, but the state’s legislature is
closely divided.</p>

id="nasa-spacecraft-rockets-toward-jupiters-moon-europa-searching-for-keys-to-life">NASA
spacecraft rockets toward Jupiter’s moon Europa, searching for keys to
life</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida — A NASA spacecraft rocketed away Monday on a
quest to explore Jupiter’s tantalizing moon Europa and reveal whether
its vast hidden ocean might hold the keys to life.</p>
<p>It will take Europa Clipper 5 1/2 years to reach Jupiter, where it
will slip into orbit around the giant gas planet and sneak close to
Europa during dozens of radiation-drenched flybys.</p>
<p>Scientists are almost certain a deep, global ocean exists beneath
Europa’s icy crust. And where there is water, there could be life,
making the moon one of the most promising places out there to hunt for
it.</p>
<p>Europa Clipper won’t look for life; it has no life detectors.
Instead, the spacecraft will zero in on the ingredients necessary to
sustain life, searching for organic compounds and other clues as it
peers beneath the ice for suitable conditions.</p>
<p>SpaceX started Clipper on its 3 billion-kilometer (1.8 million-mile)
journey, launching the spacecraft on a Falcon Heavy rocket from
Florida’s Kennedy Space Center. An hour later, the spacecraft separated
from the upper stage, floated off and called home.</p>
<p>“Please say goodbye to Clipper on its way to Europa,” NASA’s Jet
Propulsion Laboratory’s flight director Pranay Mishra announced from
Southern California.</p>
<p>“The science on this is really captivating,” NASA Associate
Administrator Jim Free told The Associated Press back at the launch
site. Scientists are still learning about the depths of our own ocean,
“and here we are looking that far out.”</p>
<p>The $5.2 billion mission almost got derailed by transistors.</p>
<p>NASA didn’t learn until spring that Clipper’s transistors might be
more vulnerable to Jupiter’s intense radiation field than anticipated.
Clipper will endure the equivalent of several million chest X-rays
during each of the 49 Europa flybys. The space agency spent months
reviewing everything before concluding in September that the mission
could proceed as planned.</p>
<p>Hurricane Milton added to the anxiety, delaying the launch by several
days.</p>
<p>“What a great day. We’re so excited,” JPL Director Laurie Leshin said
after liftoff.</p>
<p>About the size of a basketball court with its solar wings unfurled,
Clipper will swing past Mars and then Earth on its way to Jupiter for
gravity assists. The nearly 5,700-kilogram (13,000-pound) probe should
reach the solar system’s biggest planet in 2030.</p>
<p>Clipper will circle Jupiter every 21 days. One of those days will
bring it close to Europa, among 95 known moons at Jupiter and close to
our own moon in size.</p>
<p>The spacecraft will skim as low as 25 kilometers (16 miles) above
Europa — much closer than the few previous visitors. Onboard radar will
attempt to penetrate the moon’s ice sheet, believed to be 15 kilometers
to 24 kilometers (10 miles to 15 miles or more) thick. The ocean below
could be 120 kilometers (80 miles) or more deep.</p>
<p>The spacecraft holds nine instruments, with its sensitive electronics
stored in a vault with dense zinc and aluminum walls for protection
against radiation. Exploration will last until 2034.</p>
<p>“Ocean worlds like Europa are not only unique because they might be
habitable, but they might be habitable today,” NASA’s Gina DiBraccio
said on the eve of launch.</p>
<p>If conditions are found to be favorable for life at Europa, then that
opens up the possibility of life at other ocean worlds in our solar
system and beyond, according to scientists. With an underground ocean
and geysers, Saturn’s moon Enceladus is another top candidate.</p>

Bigger in Texas, Including Hydrogen Emissions</h2>

<p class="drop-caps">
Oil giants Exxon and Chevron are among a
<a href="https://www.hyvelocityhub.com/support/hyvelocity-selected-to-develop-gulf-coast-hydrogen-hub/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>group
of energy companies</u></a> that could receive up to $1.2 billion in
federal grants to make so-called “clean” hydrogen in Texas. Their
proposal to produce the clean-burning fuel using natural gas and carbon
capture, in addition to other methods, was selected by the Biden
administration a year ago to become one of the country’s seven clean
hydrogen hubs. But a trio of researchers at the University of Texas at
Austin just showed that there’s a dirty paradox at the heart of the
plan.
</p>
<p>
In a
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41560-024-01653-0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>study</u></a>
published in the journal <em><em>Nature Energy</em></em> on Monday, the
researchers show that upstream emissions in the natural gas supply chain
in Texas are so high that it’s essentially impossible to make hydrogen
from it that would meet federal standards for “clean” hydrogen. But, the
authors warn, the government’s proposed method for measuring the carbon
intensity of hydrogen overlooks these emissions. That means these Texas
hydrogen projects could get millions in public funding in the name of
tackling climate change, all while making the problem worse.
</p>
<p>
“You’re investing so much in developing a hydrogen economy, and then it
turns out, 10 years later, half of them are not even low carbon,” Arvind
Ravikumar, an associate professor at the University of Texas at Austin
and one of the authors of the new paper, told me. “I think that’s a real
risk.”
</p>
<p>
This story might sound familiar. I’ve written extensively about the
emissions accounting challenges plaguing another method for making clean
hydrogen that requires only water and carbon-free electricity, known as
electrolysis. The problem there is that the electric grid still runs
largely on fossil fuels, and so plugging in a hydrogen plant will
produce indirect emissions, even if the production process itself is
clean.
</p>
<p>
The new study highlights a similar issue with hydrogen made from natural
gas. Of course, since this method uses fossil fuels, it’s already
substantially more difficult to prove it has any climate benefits at
all. In theory, the emissions can be greatly reduced, although likely
not entirely eliminated, by capturing the carbon emitted from the plant.
The authors show, however, that the more important factor is where the
natural gas comes from.
</p>
<p>
Natural gas is mostly methane, a greenhouse gas more than 80 times more
potent than carbon dioxide in the short term, and leaks are notoriously
underestimated. But any assessment of the benefits of hydrogen made from
methane must take leakage into account, and some natural gas fields are
leakier than others.
</p>
<p>
The paper analyzes a range of scenarios for two hypothetical hydrogen
plants — one on the Gulf Coast that sources natural gas from the Permian
Basin, and one in Ohio that gets gas from the Marcellus Shale. The
Treasury Department’s draft rules for calculating the carbon intensity
of hydrogen for the clean hydrogen tax credit say these two plants
should assume that a national average of 1% of the natural gas extracted
from the ground is leaked into the atmosphere where it warms the planet.
But more than a decade of on-the-ground measurements, combined with more
recent satellite data, has shown that methane leaks vary widely from
well to well and basin to basin.
</p>
<p>
Using the more accurate, though still approximate, leakage rates of 5.2%
in the Permian and 1.25% in the Marcellus, the authors calculated the
carbon intensity of hydrogen produced at the two plants under various
assumptions. What if the carbon capture system is more effective? Or
less effective? What if the capture equipment is powered by renewables?
What if we measure the warming effects of methane over 20 years versus
over 100 years?
</p>
<p>
No matter which variable they changed, one result stayed the same:
Hydrogen made from Permian Basin gas greatly exceeded the government’s
definition of clean hydrogen, i.e. 4 kilograms of CO2 released per
kilogram of hydrogen produced. In fact, the emissions from natural gas
production in the Permian Basin alone pushed it over that standard.
Hydrogen made from Marcellus Shale gas, on the other hand, has the
potential to qualify as clean if at least 90% of the carbon at the plant
is captured.
</p>
<p>
The findings suggest that without enormous efforts to reduce those
upstream emissions, which come from leaks, venting, and flaring at the
wellhead and along the pipeline system, natural gas-based hydrogen
projects on the Gulf Coast should not qualify for federal subsidies.
</p>
<p>
The authors advocate for the Treasury’s final guidelines for calculating
the carbon intensity of hydrogen to account for these regional
differences. “I think that, to begin with, will make a huge difference
in accurately estimating the emissions intensity of these projects,”
Ravikumar said. As new methane regulations from the Environmental
Protection Agency go into effect, it’s possible that projects that are
not eligible today could become eligible in the future. “But the point
is, you’ll only know that if you do your carbon accounting accurately
across supply chains,” he said.
</p>
<p>
One problem with this solution is that hydrogen producers have access to
another federal tax credit that doesn’t require any analysis of how
clean the hydrogen is — up to $85 for every ton of carbon they capture
and sequester underground. Indeed, at least one project developer has
<a href="https://www.hydrogeninsight.com/production/exclusive-we-will-not-claim-the-us-hydrogen-production-tax-credit-on-our-4-5bn-blue-h2-plant-in-louisiana-air-products/2-1-1646412" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>already
said they will go after that subsidy</u></a> instead of the one for
clean hydrogen.
</p>
<p>
Ravikumar thinks those developers are facing a major risk. “At the end
of the day, you’re going to buy hydrogen from these companies explicitly
for its low-carbon attributes,” he said. “Right now we did this
analysis, but very soon, you’re going to have satellites that are going
to look at all these regions and be able to make emissions information
publicly available. And once you’re able to do that, you can’t make up
numbers on paper.”

Jersey Shore amusement park closes after generations of family
thrills</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>OCEAN CITY, N.J. — For generations of vacationers heading to Ocean
City, the towering “Giant Wheel” was the first thing they saw from miles
away.</p>
<p>The sight of the 140-foot-tall (42-meter) ride let them know they
were getting close to the Jersey Shore town that calls itself “America’s
Greatest Family Resort,” with its promise of kid-friendly beaches,
seagulls and sea shells, and a bustling boardwalk full of pizza, ice
cream and cotton candy.</p>
<p>And in the heart of it was Gillian’s Wonderland Pier, an amusement
park that was the latest in nearly a century-long line of
family-friendly amusement attractions operated by the family of Ocean
City’s mayor.</p>
<p>But the rides were to fall silent and still Sunday night, as the park
run by Ocean City’s mayor and nurtured by generations of his ancestors,
closed down, the victim of financial woes made worse by the lingering
aftereffects of the COVID-19 pandemic and Superstorm Sandy.</p>
<p>Gillian and his family have operated amusement rides and attractions
on the Ocean City Boardwalk for 94 years. The latest iteration of the
park, Wonderland, opened in 1965.</p>
<p>“I tried my best to sustain Wonderland for as long as possible,
through increasingly difficult challenges each year,” Mayor Jay Gillian
wrote in August when he announced the park would close. “It’s been my
life, my legacy and my family. But it’s no longer a viable
business.”</p>
<p>Gillian did not respond to numerous requests for comment over the
past week.</p>
<p>Sheryl Gross was at the park for its final day with her two children
and five grandchildren, enjoying it one last time.</p>
<p>“I’ve been coming here forever,” she said. “My daughter is 43 and
I’ve been coming here since she was 2 years old in a stroller. Now I’m
here with my grandchildren.”</p>
<p>She remembers decades of bringing her family from Gloucester Township
in the southern New Jersey suburbs of Philadelphia to create happy
family memories at Wonderland.</p>
<p>“Just the excitement on their faces when they get on the rides,” she
said. “It really made it feel family-friendly. A lot of that is going to
be lost now.”</p>
<p>There were long lines Sunday for the Giant Wheel, the log flume and
other popular rides as people used the last of ride tickets many had
bought earlier in the year, thinking Wonderland would go on forever.</p>
<p>A local non-profit group, Friends of OCNJ History and Culture, is
raising money to try and save the amusement park, possibly under a new
owner who might be more amenable to buying it with some financial
assistance. Bill Merritt, one of the non-profit’s leaders, said the
group has raised over $1 million to help meet what could be a
$20-million price tag for the property.</p>
<p>“Ocean City will be fundamentally different without this attraction,”
he said. “This town relies on being family-friendly. The park has rides
targeted at kids; it’s called ‘Wonderland’ for a reason.”</p>
<p>The property’s current owner, Icona Resorts, previously proposed a
$150-million, 325-room luxury hotel elsewhere on Ocean City’s boardwalk,
but the city rejected those plans.</p>
<p>The company’s CEO, Eustace Mita, said earlier this year he would take
at least until the end of the year to propose a use for the amusement
park property.</p>
<p>He bought it in 2021 after Gillian’s family was in danger of
defaulting on bank loans for the property.</p>
<p>At a community meeting last month, Gillian said Wonderland could not
bounce back from Superstorm Sandy in 2012, the pandemic in 2020 and an
increase in New Jersey’s minimum wage that doubled his payroll costs,
leaving him $4 million in debt.</p>
<p>Mita put up funds to stave off a sheriff’s sale of the property, and
gave the mayor three years to turn the business around. That deadline
expired this year.</p>
<p>Mita did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p>Merritt said he and others can’t imagine Ocean City without
Wonderland.</p>
<p>“You look at it with your heart, and you say ‘You’re losing all the
cherished memories and all the history; how can you let that go?’” he
said. “And then you look at it with your head and you say, ‘They are the
reason this town is profitable; how can you let that go?’”</p>

Seen Taylor Krause on ‘Love Is Blind.’ Now Read Her Policy Paper.</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-14, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzgwMzQ5Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3NzE2MzUyNX0.SyIVuFIFFT1rBzM-MPuN1wuPTVo_SCqSQANZiIY22A4/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Millions of Americans first met Washington, D.C., resident Taylor Krause
when she appeared on Netflix’s dating show “Love Is Blind.” The series
frames getting engaged as a type of matching problem, where contestants
talk to each other, fall in love, and get engaged before they meet each
other in person.
</p>
<p>
But here at Heatmap, we know Krause’s work because of a different type
of matching problem: how to match clean hydrogen makers with new sources
of clean electricity.
</p>
<p>
Krause works on the problem of decarbonizing heavy industry for the
climate policy think tank RMI. Her team is wrapped up in
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/green-hydrogen-tax-credit-treasury" target="_self"><u>a
sprawling fight</u></a> over how to regulate the clean hydrogen
industry, a fight Heatmap followed keenly. The battle could determine
how the government spends up to an estimated $100 billion in tax credits
to incentivize the production of green hydrogen.
</p>
<p>
Treasury recently told Heatmap those regulations will be finalized by
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/final-hydrogen-tax-credit-45v" target="_self"><u>the
end of the year</u></a>. Meanwhile, the newest salvo in that fight —
this being D.C., it took the form of a policy memo — was released on
Monday by RMI.
<a href="https://rmi.org/a-roadmap-for-designing-hydrogen-projects-for-45v-compliance/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>The
white paper</u></a>, coauthored by Krause, explains how developers could
actually build clean hydrogen projects that are connected to the power
grid while meeting the government’s stringent proposed standards.
</p>
<p>
It emerged in part from RMI’s collaboration with a “working group
spanning developers, registries, and electricity forecasting experts,”
according to the paper, and it proposes a series of ways hydrogen
developers can meet the stringent
“<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/hydrogen-tax-credit-rules" target="_self"><u>three
pillars</u></a>” standards the government has proposed. These rules
would require that any electricity used to electrolyze water and extract
hydrogen itself be produced by new zero-carbon sources during the same
time period it’s used, and on the same power grid as the electrolyzer.
</p>
<p>
This three-step approach aims to keep the generous hydrogen tax credit
from creating higher electricity prices across the power grid and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/hydrogen-rule-biden-clean-energy#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%E2%80%99ve%20developed%20a%20structure%20that%20will%20drive%20innovation%20and%20create%20good%2Dpaying%20jobs%20in%20this%20emerging%20industry%20while%20strengthening%20our%20energy%20security%20and%20reducing%20emissions%20in%20hard%2Dto%2Dtransition%20sectors%20of%20the%20economy%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20said." target="_self"><u>generating
more emissions</u></a> than the hydrogen produced will mitigate, but it
has been criticized by some companies for being too arduous and
complicated to comply with. (Some hydrogen makers, such as the
industrial gas-making giant Air Products,
<a href="https://www.airproducts.com/energy-transition/air-products-response-to-45v" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>support</u></a>
the three pillars approach.)
</p>
<p>
One of the biggest topics the new memo tackles is the problem of buying
clean electricity. If America regulates the clean hydrogen industry as
the Biden administration has proposed, then eventually hydrogen
companies will need to buy electricity credits from a “registry” — a
company that can guarantee the power the hydrogen companies bought
actually complies with the rules.
</p>
<p>
Those registries don’t exist right now. Until they do, the new memo
argues, hydrogen makers should go straight to the source and solve the
“matching problem” by contracting directly with a newly built solar,
wind, or zero-carbon power source, using a two-way deal like a power
purchase agreement,
<a href="https://rmi.org/people/nathan-iyer/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Nathan
Iyer</u></a>, a senior associate at RMI and co-author of the paper, told
me. (Krause didn’t have time to talk.)
</p>
<p>
In other words: If you’re a clean hydrogen maker trying to buy
electricity to power your electrolyzer, then love — or at least your
procurement budget — should <em><em>not </em></em>be blind. Good to
know. The memo ticks through a few other myths about the new standards
that Krause and Iyer want to debunk. It’s a good reminder that while
there might be no rules in love and war, there are
<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/12/26/2023-28359/section-45v-credit-for-production-of-clean-hydrogen-section-48a15-election-to-treat-clean-hydrogen#h-7" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more
than 100 pages of proposed rules</u></a> for taking advantage of the
Inflation Reduction Act’s clean hydrogen production tax credit.

researchers found that selecting parent colonies for high heat increased

it has built a new offshore wind turbine with a power-producing capacity
(26 megawatts) that is 31% bigger than its nearest competitor (18 MW),
and “surpasses even the largest models announced but not yet
constructed,” <em><em>Bloomberg</em></em>

Big turbines that generate lots of power can reduce the costs of
offshore wind operations by limiting the amount of equipment needed.
China is a leader in both offshore wind installations and large
turbines. Last week another Chinese company, CRRC Corp., said it had
made the

<em>From the BBC World Service:</em> All roads lead to Paris as the City
of Light hosts its major motor show, with French and ­Chinese car
manufacturers dominating the event with new reveals. Then, South America
has exceeded its record for wildfires this year. The Amazon rainforest
is seeing its worst fires in two decades; an area bigger than Sri Lanka
has burned in the Brazilian Amazon alone.
