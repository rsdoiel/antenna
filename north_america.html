America Hate Again: The Rise of White Supremacy in the Trump Era</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-28, from: Capital and Main</p>
<p>
Donald Trump’s administration marked a turning point. His rhetoric and
policies emboldened far-right groups, and according to the Southern
Poverty Law Center gave rise to new levels of white supremacist
influence in mainstream American government and politics.

Pollutants from gas stoves shorten people’s lives by an average of two
years, according to a new study by scientists at Jaume I University in

attributed 40,000 deaths per year in Europe to gas stoves, which leak
pollutants linked to heart and lung diseases. “Way back in 1978, we

Quarter Pounder returns after E. coli testing rules out beef</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — McDonald’s announced Sunday that Quarter Pounders will
again be on its menu at hundreds of its restaurants after testing ruled
out beef patties as the source of the outbreak of E. coli poisoning tied
to the popular burgers that killed one person and sickened at least 75
others across 13 states.</p>
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration continues to believe that
slivered onions from a single supplier are the likely source of
contamination, McDonald’s said in a statement. It said it will resume
selling the Quarter Pounder at affected restaurants — without slivered
onions — in the coming week.</p>
<p>As of Friday, the outbreak had expanded to at least 75 people sick in
13 states, federal health officials said. A total of 22 people had been
hospitalized, and two developed a dangerous kidney disease complication,
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. One person has died
in Colorado.</p>
<p>Early information analyzed by the FDA showed that uncooked slivered
onions used on the burgers “are a likely source of contamination,” the
agency said. McDonald’s has confirmed that Taylor Farms, a
California-based produce company, was the supplier of the fresh onions
used in the restaurants involved in the outbreak, and that they had come
from a facility in Colorado Springs, Colorado.</p>
<p>McDonald’s pulled the Quarter Pounder burger from menus in several
states — mostly in the Midwest and Mountain states — when the outbreak
was announced Tuesday. McDonald’s said Friday that slivered onions from
the Colorado Springs facility were distributed to approximately 900 of
its restaurants, including some in transportation hubs like
airports.</p>
<p>The company said it removed slivered onions sourced from that
facility from its supply chain on Tuesday. McDonald’s said it has
decided to stop sourcing onions from Taylor Farms’ Colorado Springs
facility “indefinitely.”</p>
<p>The 900 McDonald’s restaurants that normally received slivered onions
from Taylor Farms’ Colorado Springs facility will resume sales of
Quarter Pounders without slivered onions, McDonald’s said.</p>
<p>Testing by the Colorado Department of Agriculture ruled out beef
patties as the source of the outbreak, McDonald’s said.</p>
<p>The Department of Agriculture received multiple lots of fresh and
frozen beef patties collected from various Colorado McDonald’s locations
associated with the E. coli investigation. All samples were found to be
negative for E. coli, the department said.</p>
<p>Taylor Farms said Friday that it had preemptively recalled yellow
onions sent to its customers from its Colorado facility and continues to
work with the CDC and the FDA as they investigate.</p>
<p>While it remains unclear if the recalled onions were the source of
the outbreak, several other fast-food restaurants — including Taco Bell,
Pizza Hut, KFC and Burger King — pulled onions from some menus in
certain areas this week.</p>
<p>Colorado had the most illnesses reported as of Friday, with 26 cases.
At least 13 people were sickened in Montana, 11 in Nebraska, 5 each in
New Mexico and Utah, 4 each in Missouri and Wyoming, two in Michigan and
one each in Iowa, Kansas, Oregon, Wisconsin and Washington, the CDC
reported.</p>
<p>McDonald’s said Friday it didn’t pull the Quarter Pounder from any
additional restaurants and noted that some cases in states outside the
original region were tied to travel.</p>
<p>The CDC said some people who got sick reported traveling to other
states before their symptoms started. At least three people said they
ate at McDonald’s during their travel. Illnesses were reported between
Sept. 27 and Oct. 11.</p>
<p>The outbreak involves infections with E. coli 0157:H7, a type of
bacteria that produces a dangerous toxin. It causes about 74,000
infections in the U.S. annually, leading to more than 2,000
hospitalizations and 61 deaths each year, according to CDC.</p>
<p>Symptoms of E. coli poisoning can occur quickly, within a day or two
of eating contaminated food. They typically include fever, vomiting,
diarrhea or bloody diarrhea and signs of dehydration — little or no
peeing, increased thirst and dizziness. The infection is especially
dangerous for children younger than 5, people who are elderly, pregnant
or who have weakened immune systems.</p>

European countries match US in startup-friendly laws, report says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>STOCKHOLM — Seven European countries have changed their laws to
increase employee ownership in startups to rival the U.S. in attracting
talent and investment, while other countries are lagging, a report by
venture capital firm Index Ventures found.</p>
<p>While stock options were integral to Silicon Valley’s success, Europe
has been hampered by bureaucracy and by taxing employees too early,
among other restrictions.</p>
<p>The European Union needs a coordinated industrial policy, rapid
decisions and massive investment if it wants to keep pace with the U.S.
and China economically, Mario Draghi said in a long awaited report last
month.</p>
<p>Over 500 startup CEOs and founders joined a campaign called “Not
Optional” in 2019 to change rules that govern employee ownership — the
practice of giving staff options to acquire a slice of the company, as
European-based companies compete for talent with U.S. firms.</p>
<p>Germany, France, Portugal and the UK lead European countries in
making changes that match or exceed those of the U.S., while Finland,
Switzerland, Norway and Sweden got lower ratings in the Index
report.</p>
<p>When companies such as Revolut and others go public, that ownership
translates into real money for employees, said Martin Mignot, a partner
at Index and an investor at fintech Revolut, which is valued at $45
billion.</p>

id="missouri-sports-betting-ballot-measure-highlights-national-debate-about-tax-rates">Missouri
sports betting ballot measure highlights national debate about tax
rates</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. — The ads promoting a November ballot measure to
legalize sports betting in Missouri tout the potential for millions of
new tax dollars devoted to schools. If voters approve the measure, it’s
a good bet they will see even more ads offering special promotions for
bettors. </p>
<p>Many of those promotional costs — in which sportsbooks provide
cash-like credits for customers to place bets — will be exempt from
state taxes, effectively limiting the new revenue for education. </p>
<p>The Missouri ballot measure highlights an emerging debate among
policymakers over how to tax the rapidly growing industry, which has
spread from one state — Nevada — to 38 states and Washington, D.C.,
since the U.S. Supreme Court opened the door to legalized sports
wagering in 2018. </p>
<p>“It’s a fledging industry,” said Brent Evans, an assistant finance
professor at Georgia College &amp; State University who has taught
classes on gambling. “So nobody really knows what is a reasonable
tax.” </p>
<p>Since authorizing sports betting, Illinois, Ohio, Tennessee and
Washington, D.C., all have already raised or restructured their tax
rates. And Colorado and Virginia have pared back the tax deductions they
originally allowed. </p>
<p>Tax rates range from a low of 6.75% in states such Iowa to 51% in
states such as New York. That tax gap is even wider, because Iowa allows
promotional bets to be deducted from taxable revenue while New York does
not. </p>
<p>About half the states allow tax deductions for promotional costs.
It’s a common way of enticing people to start — or continue — making
bets. But in the short-term, it also can decrease the tax revenue
available for governments and schools. </p>
<p>Missouri’s proposed 10% tax rate on sports betting revenue is below
the national average of 19% that sportsbooks paid to states last year.
Because of deductions for “free play,” there could be some months in
which sportsbooks owe nothing to the state. Missouri’s proposed
constitutional amendment acknowledges that possibility, stating that
negative balances can be carried over from one month to the next until
revenue rises enough to owe taxes. </p>
<p>Unlike in some states, Missouri’s amendment caps the amount of
promotional credits that can be deducted from taxable revenue, at 25% of
all wagers. But it appears unlikely that cap would come into play. An
analysis conducted by consultant Eilers &amp; Krejcik Gaming for
amendment supporters projects promotional bets will comprise around 8%
of total wagers in Missouri’s first year of sports betting, declining
after that. </p>
<p>The Missouri proposal “is very much in line with what has worked and
been effective in other states,” said Jack Cardetti, a spokesman for
Winning for Missouri Education, the group backing the measure. </p>
<p>After voters narrowly approved it, Colorado launched sports betting
in 2020 with a 10% tax rate and full deductions for promotional bets. It
logged $2.7 billion of total bets during its first full fiscal year,
yielding $8.1 million in taxes, just slightly below legislative
projections. But Colorado changed its law starting in 2023 to cap
promotional tax deductions at 2.5% of total bets, gradually declining to
1 .75% by July 2026. </p>
<p>Colorado’s sports betting tax revenue has since risen to over $30
million in its most recent fiscal year. That growth led lawmakers to
place a proposal on the November ballot seeking permission for the state
to keep more than the original $29 million limit on sports betting tax
revenue. </p>
<p>Capping tax deductions for promotional bets is a good step, said
Richard Auxier, a principal policy associate at the nonprofit Tax Policy
Center. But he questions why some states exempt them from taxes in the
first place. </p>
<p>“We don’t give out free samples of cannabis when a state legalizes
cannabis,” Auxier said. “Is this something you want to be subsidizing
through your state tax policy — to encourage people to gamble?” </p>
<p>The Missouri amendment was placed on the November ballot by
initiative petition after legislation to legalize sports betting
repeatedly stalled in the state Senate. The $43 million campaign — a
record for a Missouri ballot measure — has been been funded entirely by
DraftKings and FanDuel, which dominate the nationwide sports betting
marketplace. If the measure passes, the companies could apply for two
statewide licenses to conduct online sports betting. The amendment
authorizes additional sports betting licenses for Missouri casinos and
professional sports teams. </p>
<p>The $14 million opposition campaign has been funded entirely by
Caesars Entertainment, which operates three of Missouri’s 13 casinos.
Although Caesars generally supports sports betting, it opposes “the way
this measure is written,” said Brooke Foster, a spokesperson for the
opposition group Missourians Against the Deceptive Online Gambling
Amendment. </p>
<p>In some other states, sports betting is run through casinos. Though
research is limited, a study of seven states released last year found
that casino gambling revenue declined as online sports betting
increased. </p>
<p>“There will definitely be a shift from placing bets in a physical
space with a Missouri incorporated casino versus hopping on an app in
your living room,” Foster said. </p>
<p>The effect of different tax rates can be seen in Illinois and New
Jersey, which spearheaded the court challenge leading to widespread
legal sports betting. People in each state placed between $11.5 billion
and $12 billion of sports bets last year, resulting in $1 billion of
revenue for sportsbooks after winnings were paid to customers, according
to figures from the American Gaming Association. </p>
<p>New Jersey took in $129 million in tax revenue, based on a 14.25% tax
rate for online sports bets and a 9.75% tax rate with some promotional
deductions for sports bets at casinos and racetracks. Illinois took in
$162 million of tax revenue — one-quarter more than New Jersey — with a
15% tax rate in most places and no promotional deductions. </p>
<p>But Illinois officials weren’t satisfied with those results.
Beginning in July, Illinois imposed a progressive tax scale, starting
with a 20% tax on sports betting revenue of less than $30 million and
rising to a 40% rate on revenue exceeding $200 million. </p>
<p>Some sportsbooks representatives had raised the possibility of
leaving Illinois if tax rates rose. But that hasn’t happened. </p>
<p>There’s also not much evidence that sportsbooks worsen the odds for
wagers in states where they pay higher taxes, said Joe Weinert,
executive vice president of Spectrum Gaming Group, a consulting
firm. </p>
<p>“The sports betting operators compete vigorously for bettors,” he
said, “and how you compete vigorously is to offer attractive odds and
good promotions.”</p>

id="how-to-prepare-for-potential-health-effects-of-upcoming-end-to-daylight-saving-time">How
to prepare for potential health effects of upcoming end to daylight
saving time</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The good news: You will get a glorious extra hour of sleep. The bad:
It’ll be dark as a pocket by late afternoon for the next few months in
the U.S. </p>
<p>Daylight saving time ends at 2 a.m. local time next Sunday, Nov. 3,
which means you should set your clock back an hour before you go to bed.
Standard time will last until March 9 when we will again “spring
forward” with the return of daylight saving time. </p>
<p>That spring time change can be tougher on your body. Darker mornings
and lighter evenings can knock your internal body clock out of whack,
making it harder to fall asleep on time for weeks or longer. Studies
have even found an uptick in heart attacks and strokes right after the
March time change. </p>
<p>“Fall back” should be easier. But it still may take a while to adjust
your sleep habits, not to mention the downsides of leaving work in the
dark or trying exercise while there’s still enough light. Some people
with seasonal affective disorder, a type of depression usually linked to
the shorter days and less sunlight of fall and winter, may struggle,
too. </p>
<p>Some health groups, including the American Medical Association and
American Academy of Sleep Medicine, have said it’s time to do away with
time switches and that sticking with standard time aligns better with
the sun — and human biology. </p>
<p>Most countries do not observe daylight saving time. For those that do
— mostly in Europe and North America — the date that clocks are changed
varies. </p>
<p>Two states — Arizona and Hawaii — don’t change and stay on standard
time. </p>
<p>Here’s what to know about the twice yearly ritual. </p>
<p>How the body reacts to light </p>
<p>The brain has a master clock that is set by exposure to sunlight and
darkness. This circadian rhythm is a roughly 24-hour cycle that
determines when we become sleepy and when we’re more alert. The patterns
change with age, one reason that early-to-rise youngsters evolve into
hard-to-wake teens. </p>
<p>Morning light resets the rhythm. By evening, levels of a hormone
called melatonin begin to surge, triggering drowsiness. Too much light
in the evening — that extra hour from daylight saving time — delays that
surge and the cycle gets out of sync. </p>
<p>And that circadian clock affects more than sleep, also influencing
things like heart rate, blood pressure, stress hormones and
metabolism. </p>
<p>How do time changes affect sleep? </p>
<p>Even an hour change on the clock can throw off sleep schedules —
because even though the clocks change, work and school start times stay
the same. </p>
<p>That’s a problem because so many people are already sleep deprived.
About 1 in 3 U.S. adults sleep less than the recommended seven-plus
hours nightly, and more than half of U.S. teens don’t get the
recommended eight-plus hours on weeknights. </p>
<p>Sleep deprivation is linked to heart disease, cognitive decline,
obesity and numerous other problems. </p>
<p>How to prepare for the time change </p>
<p>Some people try to prepare for a time change jolt by changing their
bed times little by little in the days before the change. There are ways
to ease the adjustment, including getting more sunshine to help reset
your circadian rhythm for healthful sleep. </p>
<p>Will the U.S. ever get rid of the time change? </p>
<p>Lawmakers occasionally propose getting rid of the time change
altogether. The most prominent recent attempt, a now-stalled bipartisan
bill named the Sunshine Protection Act, proposes making daylight saving
time permanent. Health experts say the lawmakers have it backward —
standard time should be made permanent.</p>

id="biden-marks-anniversary-of-pittsburgh-synagogue-attack-that-killed-11">Biden
marks anniversary of Pittsburgh synagogue attack that killed 11</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PITTSBURGH — President Joe Biden on Sunday marked the sixth
anniversary of a gunman’s deadly attack on a Pittsburgh synagogue and
called out what he called an “appalling surge of antisemitism” amid the
war in Gaza. </p>
<p>The 2018 attack claimed the lives of 11 worshippers from Dor Hadash,
New Light and Tree of Life congregations, which shared space in the
synagogue in Squirrel Hill, the heart of Pittsburgh’s Jewish community.
Two worshippers and five responding police officers were also injured in
the attack, the deadliest act of antisemitism in U.S. history. </p>
<p>Biden said in a statement that the attack “shattered families,
pierced the heart of the Jewish community, and struck the soul of our
nation.” But he said that in the years since, the Jewish community “has
also shown the country how to courageously turn pain into purpose”
launching “a global initiative to counter hate and hate-fueled
violence.” </p>
<p>Biden noted that the remembrance of the Pittsburgh synagogue attack
comes weeks after the anniversary of the Oct. 7 attack in Israel “during
which Hamas killed more than 1,200 people, took another 250 hostage and
committed horrific acts of sexual assault.” </p>
<p>He said the trauma and losses of Oct. 7 are made worse by “the
appalling surge of antisemitism against Jews in America and around the
world.” </p>
<p>The attack sparked a war between Israel and the militant group Hamas
and has resulted in widespread destruction and civilian deaths in
Gaza. </p>
<p>Biden said his administration was implementing a national strategy to
counter antisemitism, including securing $1.2 billion for security of
nonprofits such as synagogues and Jewish community centers and day
schools. He also cited the Justice Department’s investigation and
prosecution of antisemitic hate crimes and said his administration had
“put colleges on notice that antisemitism is discrimination” and barred
under laws protecting civil rights. </p>
<p>Vice President Kamala Harris also cited a rise in antisemitism in a
statement marking the anniversary of the Pittsburgh attack. </p>
<p>“I will always work to ensure the safety and security of Jewish
people in the United States and around the world and will always call
out antisemitism whenever and wherever we see it,” she said. </p>
<p>The Pittsburgh attacker was sentenced to death last year after being
convicted on 63 counts, including hate crimes resulting in death. </p>
<p>In June, ground was broken for a new complex on the Pittsburgh site
that is to include a cultural center, sanctuary, educational center and
museum along with a memorial to the slain worshipers from three
congregations.</p>

id="on-navajo-nation-push-to-electrify-more-homes-on-vast-reservation">On
Navajo Nation, push to electrify more homes on vast reservation</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>HALCHITA, Utah — After a five-year wait, Lorraine Black and Ricky
Gillis heard the rumblings of an electrical crew reach their home on the
sprawling Navajo Nation. </p>
<p>In five days’ time, their home would be connected to the power grid,
replacing their reliance on a few solar panels and propane lanterns. No
longer would the CPAP machine Gillis uses for sleep apnea or his home
heart monitor transmitting information to doctors 400 miles away face
interruptions due to intermittent power. It also means Black and Gillis
can now use more than a few appliances — such as a fridge, a TV, and an
evaporative cooling unit — at the same time. </p>
<p>“We’re one of the luckiest people who get to get electric,” Gillis
said. </p>
<p>Many Navajo families still live without running water and
electricity, a product of historic neglect and the struggle to get
services to far-flung homes on the 70,000-square-kilometer
(27,000-square-mile) Native American reservation that lies in parts of
Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. Some rely on solar panels or generators,
which can be patchy, and others have no electricity whatsoever. </p>
<p>Gillis and Black filed an application to connect their home back in
2019. But when the coronavirus pandemic started ravaging the tribe and
everything besides essential services was shut down on the reservation,
it further stalled the process. </p>
<p>Their wait highlights the persistent challenges in electrifying every
Navajo home, even with recent injections of federal money for tribal
infrastructure and services and as extreme heat in the Southwest
intensified by climate change adds to the urgency. </p>
<p>“We are a part of America that a lot of the time feels kind of left
out,” said Vircynthia Charley, district manager at the Navajo Tribal
Utility Authority, a non-for-profit utility that provides electric,
water, wastewater, natural gas and solar energy services. </p>
<p>For years, the Navajo Tribal Utility Authority has worked to get more
Navajo homes connected to the grid faster. Under a program called Light
Up Navajo, which uses a mix of private and public funding, outside
utilities from across the U.S. send electric crews to help connect homes
and extend power lines. </p>
<p>But installing power on the reservation roughly the size of West
Virginia is time-consuming and expensive due to its rugged geography and
the vast distances between homes. Drilling for power poles there can
take several hours because of underground rock deposits while some homes
near Monument Valley must have power lines installed underground to meet
strict regulations around development in the area. </p>
<p>About 32% of Navajo homes still have no electricity. Connecting the
remaining 10,400 homes on the reservation would cost $416 million, said
Deenise Becenti, government and public affairs manager at the
utility. </p>
<p>This year, Light Up Navajo connected 170 more families to the grid.
Since the program started in 2019, 882 Navajo families have had their
homes electrified. If the program stays funded, Becenti said it could
take another 26 years to connect every home on the reservation. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Those that get connected immediately reap the benefits. </p>
<p>Until this month, Black and Gillis’ solar panels that the utility
installed a few years ago would last about two to three days before
their battery drained in cloudy weather. It would take another two days
to recharge. </p>
<p>“You had to really watch the watts and whatever you’re using on a
cloudy day,” Gillis said. </p>
<p>Then a volunteer power crew from Colorado helped install 14 power
poles while the tribal utility authority drilled holes six feet deep in
which the poles would sit. The crew then ran a wire about a mile down a
red sand road from the main power line to the couple’s home. </p>
<p>“The lights are brighter,” Black remarked after her home was
connected. </p>
<p>In recent years, significantly more federal money has been allocated
for tribes to improve infrastructure on reservations, including $32
billion from the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 — of which Navajo
Nation received $112 million for electric connections. The Navajo tribal
utility also received $17 million through the Biden administration’s
climate law, known as the Inflation Reduction Act, to connect families
to the electric grid. But it can be slow to see the effects of that
money on the ground due to bureaucracy and logistics. </p>
<p>Next spring, the tribal utility authority hopes to connect another
150 homes, including the home of Priscilla and Leo Dan. </p>
<p>For the couple, having grid electricity at their home near Navajo
Mountain in Arizona would end a nearly 12-year wait. They currently live
in a recreational vehicle elsewhere closer to their jobs but have worked
on their home on the reservation for years. With power there, they could
spend more time where Priscilla grew up and where her dad still
lives. </p>
<p>It would make life simpler, Priscilla said. “Because otherwise,
everything, it seems like, takes twice as long to do.”</p>

id="venom-the-last-dance-misses-projections-as-superhero-films-grip-on-theaters-loosens">‘Venom:
The Last Dance’ misses projections as superhero films’ grip on theaters
loosens</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — “Venom: The Last Dance” showed less bite than expected at
the box office, collecting $51 million in its opening weekend, according
to studio estimates Sunday, significantly down from the alien symbiote
franchise’s previous entries.</p>
<p>Projections for the third “Venom” film from Sony Pictures had been
closer to $65 million. More concerning, though, was the drop off from
the first two “Venom” films. The 2018 original debuted with $80.2
million, while the 2021 follow-up, “Venom: Let There Be Carnage,” opened
with $90 million even as theaters were still in recovery mode during the
pandemic.</p>
<p>“The Last Dance,” starring Tom Hardy as a journalist who shares his
body with an alien entity also voiced by Hardy, could still turn a
profit for Sony. Its production budget, not accounting for promotion and
marketing, was about $120 million — significantly less than most
comic-book films.</p>
<p>But “The Last Dance” is also performing better overseas.
Internationally, “Venom: The Last Dance” collected $124 million over the
weekend, including $46 million over five days of release in China.
That’s good enough for one of the best international weekends of the
year for a Hollywood release.</p>
<p>Still, neither reviews (36% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) nor audience
scores (a franchise-low “B-” CinemaScore) have been good for the film
scripted by Kelly Marcel and Hardy, and directed by Marcel.</p>
<p>The low weekend for “Venom: The Last Dance” also likely insures that
superhero films will see their lowest-grossing year in a dozen years,
not counting the pandemic year of 2020, according to David A. Gross, a
film consultant who publishes a newsletter for Franchise
Entertainment.</p>
<p>Following on the heels of the “Joker: Folie à Deux” flop, Gross
estimates that 2024 superhero films will gross about $2.25 billion
worldwide. The only upcoming entry is Marvel’s “Kraven the Hunter,” due
out Dec. 13. Even with the $1.3 billion of “Deadpool &amp; Wolverine,”
the genre hasn’t, overall, been dominating the way it once did. In 2018,
for example, superhero films accounted for more than $7 billion in
global ticket sales.</p>
<p>Last week’s top film, the Paramount Pictures horror sequel “Smile 2,”
dropped to second place with $9.4 million. That brings its two-week
total to $83.7 million worldwide.</p>
<p>The weekend’s biggest success story might have been “Conclave,” the
papal thriller starring Ralph Fiennes and directed by Edward Berger
(“All Quiet on the Western Front”). The Focus Features release, a major
Oscar contender, launched with $6.5 million in 1,753 theaters.</p>
<p>That put “Conclave” into third place, making it the rare
adult-oriented drama to make a mark theatrically. Some 77% of ticket
buyers were over the age of 35, Focus said. With a strong opening and
stellar reviews, “Conclave” could continue to gather momentum both with
moviegoers and Oscar voters.</p>

theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released
Monday.</p>

is GivingTuesday? Annual day of charitable giving approaches</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Since it started as a hashtag in 2012, GivingTuesday, the Tuesday
after Thanksgiving, has become one of the biggest fundraising days of
the year for nonprofits in the U.S.</p>
<p>In 2022 and 2023, GivingTuesday raised $3.1 billion for charitable
organizations, according to estimates from GivingTuesday.</p>
<p>This year, GivingTuesday is on December 3.</p>
<p>How did GivingTuesday start?</p>
<p>The #GivingTuesday hashtag started as a project of the 92nd Street Y
in New York in 2012 and became an independent organization in 2020. It’s
grown into a worldwide network of local organizations that promote
giving in their communities, often on different dates that have local
relevance, such as holidays.</p>
<p>Now, GivingTuesday, the nonprofit, also convenes researchers working
on topics about everyday giving. It collects data from a wide range of
sources such as payment processors, crowdfunding sites, employee giving
software and institutions that offer donor-advised funds, a kind of
charitable-giving account.</p>
<p>What is the purpose of GivingTuesday?</p>
<p>The hashtag was started to promote generosity, and the nonprofit
continues to promote giving in the broadest sense.</p>
<p>For nonprofits, the point of GivingTuesday is to raise money and
engage their supporters. Many will be familiar with the barrage of email
and mail appeals that coincide on the Tuesday after Thanksgiving.
Essentially all major American nonprofits will organize fundraising
campaigns, and many smaller, local groups also participate.</p>
<p>Nonprofits don’t have to be affiliated in any way with GivingTuesday,
the organization, to run a fundraising campaign. They can just do it,
although GivingTuesday does provide graphics and advice. In that way, it
remains a grassroots effort with groups and donors participating however
they like.</p>
<p>Has GivingTuesday been successful?</p>
<p>That depends on how success is measured, but it certainly has grown
far beyond the initial effort to promote giving on social media. The day
has become an enduring and well-known event that seeks to center
charitable giving, volunteering and civic participation in the United
States and around the world.</p>
<p>For years, GivingTuesday has been a major focus of fundraising for
nonprofits, with many seeking to organize matching donations from major
donors and leverage their networks of supporters to contribute. It is
the beginning of the end-of-year fundraising rush, as nonprofits seek to
reach their budget targets for the following year.</p>
<p>Donations on GivingTuesday in 2022 and 2023 reached $3.1 billion, an
increase from $2.7 billion in 2021. While that’s a lot to raise in a
single day, the trend last year was flat and with fewer donors giving,
which the organization said is a worrying sign.</p>

urban-rural divide</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The divide between urban and rural voters is a key indicator in U.S.
electoral politics. Cities favoring Democrats and rural areas favoring
Republicans isn’t new. But since 2000, the gap has grown dramatically.
What is behind this trend, and why is it so important? The answer is
partly economic — but there are also complex cultural factors involved.

astronaut released from hospital after return from space station</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — A NASA astronaut who was hospitalized upon return from
the International Space Station for an unspecified medical condition was
released Saturday in “good health,” the U.S. space agency said. </p>
<p>The four-member Crew-8 mission splashed down off the coast of Florida
early Friday after nearly eight months aboard the orbital
laboratory.   </p>
<p>NASA did not reveal which of the astronauts was hospitalized nor the
reason, citing medical privacy.   </p>
<p>However, it said in a blog post that the crew member has returned to
the Johnson Space Center in Houston “in good health and will resume
normal post-flight reconditioning with other crew members.”   </p>
<p>On its way back to Earth, the SpaceX Dragon executed a normal
re-entry and splashdown, and recovery of the crew and spacecraft was
without incident, NASA said.   </p>
<p>But during routine medical assessments on the recovery ship, an
“additional evaluation of the crew members was requested out of an
abundance of caution,” it added, without elaborating. </p>
<p>NASA astronauts Matthew Dominick, Michael Barratt and Jeanette Epps,
and Roscosmos cosmonaut Alexander Grebenkin were all flown to Ascension
Sacred Heart Pensacola.   </p>
<p>Three were subsequently released, while one remained at the hospital
“under observation as a precautionary measure.”</p>
