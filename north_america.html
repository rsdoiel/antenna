(date: 2025-12-05)
      <p>
      <p>Reform UK leader’s legal threats, denials and attacks on the media are tactics often deployed by US president</p>
<p>When Nigel Farage angrily denounced the BBC and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/dec/04/farage-turns-on-broadcasters-racism-allegations-bbc">insulted one of its presenters</a> for raising questions about his alleged schoolboy racism, those who have been studying the tactics of the right noted that his behaviour felt familiar.</p>
<p>“Is it out of the Trump playbook? I think that’s exactly what’s going on,” said Steven Barnett, a professor of communications at the University of Westminster. “This is becoming his new modus operandi, turning defence into attack. It’s exactly the tactics White House press secretary, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/28/karoline-leavitt-white-house-press-conference">Karoline Leavitt</a>, uses. There are a lot of journalists in this country who just aren’t used to it.”</p>

      <h1>Science journal retracts study on safety of Monsanto’s Roundup: ‘serious ethical concerns’</h1>

(date: 2025-12-05)
      <p>
      <p>Paper published in 2000 found glyphosate was not harmful, while internal emails later revealed company’s influence</p>
<p>The journal Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273230099913715">has formally retracted</a> a sweeping scientific paper published in 2000 that became a key defense for Monsanto’s claim that Roundup herbicide and its active ingredient glyphosate don’t cause cancer.</p>
<p>Martin van den Berg, the journal’s editor in chief, said in a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273230099913715">note</a> accompanying the retraction that he had taken the step because of “serious ethical concerns regarding the independence and accountability of the authors of this article and the academic integrity of the carcinogenicity studies presented”.</p>
<p>The paper, titled Safety Evaluation and Risk Assessment of the Herbicide Roundup and Its Active Ingredient, Glyphosate, for Humans, concluded that Monsanto’s glyphosate-based weed killers posed no health risks to humans – no cancer risks, no reproductive risks, no adverse effects on development of endocrine systems in people or animals.</p>

(date: 2025-12-05)
      <p>
      <p>How wired into your brain are tech companies? Spotify offers us a clue. The streaming company runs its Spotify Wrapped marketing campaign every December, taking user data and AI to create a personalized year-in-review for every listener — and it's an incredibly effective marketing move that consumers want to be a part of. Also: a preview of the last Fed meeting of the year and a manufacturing CEO's thoughts on tariffs and factory activity.</p>

      <h1>Pam Bondi tells law enforcement agencies to investigate antifa groups for ‘tax crimes’</h1>

(date: 2025-12-05)
      <p>
      <p>Move is part of Trump’s broader crackdown on leftwing groups, including designation of antifa as ‘domestic terrorism’ group</p>

</ul>
<p>The US attorney general, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pam-bondi">Pam Bondi</a>, instructed law enforcement officials on Thursday to investigate <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/25/us-antifa-groups-terror-list">antifa</a> and other supposeddomestic terror groups, and specifically directed them to search for “tax crimes” the groups may have committed, according to a memo obtained by the Guardian.</p>
<p>The document signals how the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> and Bondi are ramping up efforts to crack down on leftwing groups. Antifa, short for antifascist, is not a clearly defined organization, but rather a loose network of activists. Trump <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/22/trump-executive-order-antifa-terrorist-organization">signed an executive order</a> in September declaring it a domestic terrorism organization – something legal experts say he does not have the authority to do.</p>

      <p>Defenders rally to Olivia Nuzzi amid book mockery, while rakish David Dimbleby channels his inner Dickens</p>
<p>It’s publication week for American Canto, the hastily turned around memoir by the former New York magazine journalist Olivia Nuzzi, who took on the challenge of explaining what it was about Robert F Kennedy Jr she found so alluring, a task for which no upper word limit is adequate. Nuzzi, if you’ve fallen behind, developed romantic feelings for the then presidential candidate, now Trump health minister, while profiling him for the magazine and since I’ve had to read this sentence, you do too: “He was exhausted, and he threw himself onto the bed, his pink shirt unbuttoned, revealing my favorite parts of his chest.” If you have a favourite part of RFK Jr’s chest, or consider chests in general subject to preference by localised area, this may be the book for you.</p>

      <h1>Netflix is buying Warner Bros. Discovery</h1>

(date: 2025-12-05)
      <p>
      <p>Following a fierce bidding war, Netflix announced this morning that it’s buying Warner Bros. Discovery in a deal worth more than $82 billion. The deal still has to be approved by regulators, and some lawmakers are already raising antitrust concerns. We learn more. Then, as part of our lunar economy mini-series, we hear what a lack of private interest oversight could mean for an economy beyond the clouds.</p>

<p>Two men who survived a US airstrike on a suspected drug smuggling boat in the Caribbean clung to the wreckage for an hour before they were killed in a second attack, according to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/04/video-second-boat-strike-military-caribbean">a video of the episode shown to senators</a> in Washington.</p>
<p>The men were shirtless, unarmed and carried no visible radio or other communications equipment. They also appeared to have no idea what had just hit them, or that the US military was weighing whether to finish them off, two sources familiar with the recording told Reuters.</p>

(date: 2025-12-05)
      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Major airports in India have descended into chaos after the airline IndiGo either canceled or delayed hundreds of flights for the fourth consecutive day. IndiGo says there have been technical issues with aircraft or winter schedules that have delayed some flights, but the biggest reason is a pilot shortage. Also, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda have signed a peace deal, and some countries are boycotting Eurovision over Israel's involvement.</p>

      <p>
      <p>The Trump administration has been trying for months to ban AI regulations at the state level. And its latest gambit to roll such a measure into the congressional National Defense Authorization Act appears to have failed. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise said Tuesday that GOP leadership is now <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/03/another-bid-to-block-state-ai-regulation-has-failedfor-now/">“looking at other places”</a> to include that measure after reportedly facing pushback from both parties.</p>
<p>Plus, New York recently became the first state to enforce an AI law designed to protect consumers from &quot;algorithmic pricing.&quot; And Amazon pulled back on AI dubbing for some international content after anime fans complained.</p>

      <h1>Inter Miami’s journey to MLS Cup has been methodical, and Messi-centered</h1>

(date: 2025-12-05)
      <p>
      <p>Ever since the club’s very beginning, David Beckham and Jorge Mas have had moments like this Saturday in mind</p>
<p>Back on 27 February 2020, days before Inter Miami’s first-ever fixture in MLS, I stood next to the club’s managing owner, Jorge Mas, and co-owner David Beckham as part of an MLS press junket in New York City. I was there for Sports Illustrated and my show Planet Fútbol TV, which I co-hosted with my friend, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/10/grant-wahl-death-world-cup-qatar-2022-tribute-soccer">the late, great Grant Wahl</a>. We were adamant that the Inter Miami story was riveting, not just because of Beckham’s influence in MLS, but also because his new club was about to introduce the unique culture of Miami and south Florida – the Latin American capital of the world – to the league.</p>
<p>The conversation in 2020 was my second meeting with Mas and my first with Beckham. I remember the sense of excitement from both men, knowing that this Inter Miami project – seven years in the making before their debut in the league – was about to come to fruition after a long, arduous journey. From legal battles with Internazionale over the trademark of the word “Inter” to political and structural problems as they tried to make a stadium, Miami Freedom Park, a reality. Now, the club was finally starting life in MLS.</p>

      <p>Daughter of James Comey was dismissed by Trump justice department from job as prosecutor in New York</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/17/who-is-maurene-comey-fired-federal-prosector">Maurene Comey</a>, the federal prosecutor who helmed criminal cases against Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, appeared at Manhattan federal court on Thursday, in a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/15/epstein-prosecutor-maurene-comey-lawsuit">lawsuit</a> claiming she was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/16/maurene-comey-fired-sources">fired</a> as political retaliation against her father, James Comey.</p>
<p>Comey was terminated in July, shortly after the federal trial of Sean “Diddy” Combs, whose prosecution she led; he was found guilty of prostitution-related crimes. Comey’s lawsuit contends that Donald Trump’s justice department axed her without explanation or cause, and instead simply cited “article 2 of the United States constitution and the laws of the United States” in an email.</p>

      <p>Major win for Trump as justices reject lower-court ruling that found maps had been racially gerrymandered</p>
<p>Texas can use a redrawn congressional map that adds as many as five Republican-friendly seats, the supreme court has ruled, giving Donald Trump and the GOP a major win in their push to add Republican congressional seats ahead of next year’s midterm elections.</p>
<p>The supreme court’s decision came after a 2-1 ruling from a three-judge panel striking down Texas’s new map in November. The majority found the state had likely sorted voters based on their race – an unlawful practice called racial gerrymandering – when they adopted the new maps. The majority ordered the state to use the maps it had adopted after the 2020 census for next year’s election.</p>

</ul>
<p>Marco Odermatt of Switzerland won the downhill season-opener Thursday, beating American Ryan Cochran-Siegle in a World Cup race on a tricky but shorter Birds of Prey course.</p>
<p>Odermatt finished in 1min 29.84sec to surpass Cochran-Siegle by .30sec. Norway’s Adrian Smiseth Sejersted finished third. The finish line was moved up the hill – and just barely visible by fans in the stands – due to a lack of snow to properly place the safety netting.</p>

      <p>Zoe Rosenberg, 23, studying at UC Berkeley, had said it was a ‘rescue’ and ‘will not apologize’ for her actions</p>
<p>A California student has been sentenced to 90 days in jail after breaking into a Petaluma poultry and taking four chickens in an effort she called a “rescue”.</p>
<p>Zoe Rosenberg, a 23-year-old student at the University of California, Berkeley, was convicted of felony conspiracy and three misdemeanor counts in October. On Wednesday, a jury sentenced her to 90 days – 60 of which may involve jail alternates, such as house arrest – far less than the four and a half year maximum sentence she could have faced. The jury also ordered Rosenberg to pay more than $100,000 to Petaluma Poultry, the Perdue Farms facility from which she took four chickens in 2023. Rosenberg has been ordered to report to the Sonoma county jail on 10 December.</p>

<p>Top Democratic and Republican lawmakers in Congress on Thursday said that the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, had not ordered the military to kill surviving members of a deadly attack on a boat alleged to be carrying drugs in the Caribbean, but differed over whether the double strike was appropriate.</p>
<p>The allegation that Hegseth ordered the killing of survivors sparked <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/04/venezuela-boat-strikes-legality-hegseth">bipartisan concern</a> in Washington that he or others involved may have committed a war crime. On Thursday, US navy admiral Frank Bradley, who commanded the attack, and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Dan Caine, appeared before the House and Senate’s armed services and intelligence committees for a closed briefing in which they showed video and discussed the attack with lawmakers.</p>

      <p>
      <p>An investigation found defense secretary put US forces at risk, triggering fresh demands for his resignation</p>
<p>The Department of Defense’s inspector general released the much-anticipated unclassified <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2025/Dec/04/2003834916/-1/-1/1/DODIG_2026_021.PDF">report</a> on Thursday about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pete-hegseth">Pete Hegseth</a>’s disclosure of plans for military airstrikes in Yemen in a Signal group chat earlier this year.</p>
<p>It found that Hegseth violated departmental policies when he shared information in the chat, and that if a foreign enemy force intercepted that information it could have endangered the lives of US troops, as the Guardian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/03/hegseth-yemen-signal-group-chat">reported on Wednesday</a>. “Using a personal cell phone to conduct official business and send nonpublic DoD information through Signal risks potential compromise of sensitive DoD information, which could cause harm to DoD personnel and mission objectives,” the report said.</p>

<p>The meeting of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) turned confrontational at times before one member introduced a motion to delay the vote, which passed by six to three, to give advisers time to examine the wording before taking a vote.</p>

<p>As Donald Trump went on another extended racist tirade against Somalis on Wednesday, Minneapolis activists prepared for more targeting of the community by conducting trainings on their rights and planning how they would protect their neighbors.</p>
<p>In the White House on Wednesday, a reporter asked the president about Minneapolis’s mayor, Jacob Frey, who has defended the Somali community. Trump responded: “I wouldn’t be proud to have the largest Somalian – look at their nation. Look how bad their nation is. It’s not even a nation. It’s just people walking around killing each other. Look, these Somalians have taken billions of dollars out of our country. Billions and billions.”</p>

      <p>These days, Americans are drinking less alcohol. While that may be a positive from a health perspective, it’s not great news for California grape growers. Industry groups predict that 2025 will be the smallest harvest since the mid-’90s. These changing consumption habits are changing the landscape of California vineyards. Also, the Trump administration is reducing fuel efficiency standards, and layoffs are running high ahead of the next Federal Reserve meeting.</p>

As a result, many leading outlets <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/13/defense-department-media-news-rules">turned in their credentials in protest</a>.</p>

<p>Donald Trump is seizing on the shooting of two national guard members, allegedly by an Afghan man, to press his immigration crackdown still farther. In the aftermath of the attack, which left guard member Sarah Beckstrom dead and colleague Andrew Wolfe in critical condition, Trump directed US Citizenship and Immigration Services to pause all pending asylum applications.</p>
<p>USCIS followed up that announcement with more seismic shifts to immigration policy. This is how the White House is reshaping the process for requesting asylum, green cards and citizenship.</p>

<p>Detainees at the notorious Florida immigration jail known as “Alligator Alcatraz” were shackled inside a 2ft-high metal cage and left outside without water for up to a day at a time, a shocking report published on Thursday by Amnesty International alleges.</p>
<p><strong>Didn’t a judge order the facility to shut down?</strong> A federal judge in August <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/21/trump-alligator-alcatraz-judge-ruling">ordered it to close</a> after a wave of criticism and a lawsuit by environmental groups. However, by October, the facility was operating again with hundreds of detainees after two Trump-appointed appellate court judges – one whose husband <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/02/alligator-alcatraz-ron-desantis-paul-huck">has close ties</a> to the Republican governor Ron DeSantis – blocked the closure ruling.</p>
<p><strong>Has the state of Florida responded to the allegations?</strong> The press secretary to DeSantis told the Guardian the allegations were “fabrications” and part of a “politically motivated attack”.</p>
<p><strong>Why have they released these photos now?</strong> It’s unclear. Even though the images do not reveal anything new, they keep the pressure on the Trump administration ahead of a 19 December deadline for the justice department to release files, as per the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/18/house-vote-epstein-documents">Epstein Files Transparency Act</a>, signed 19 November.</p>

      <h1>Meta faces an investigation over AI in WhatsApp</h1>

(date: 2025-12-04)
      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> European antitrust regulators have just launched an investigation into Meta over its rollout of artificial intelligence features on WhatsApp for European users. This move marks the latest action by European regulators against large technology firms, as the trade bloc seeks to balance support for the sector with efforts to curb its expanding influence. Then, air travelers in India face continued disruptions, and Japan tries to regain a stronghold in semiconductor chip manufacturing.</p>

(date: 2025-12-04)
      <p>
      <p>Pentagon’s Law of War manual clearly prohibits attack, but justification for whole campaign also faces tough questions</p>
<p>Graphic depictions of two survivors being killed by a second US military strike on an alleged Venezuelan drug ferrying boat have provoked outrage where previously there was none – or at least relatively little.</p>
<p>A firestorm of controversy has greeted a recent Washington Post report which suggested that a deadly attack on a vessel carrying 11 people in the Caribbean was followed with a second assault after the initial strike failed to kill everybody onboard.</p>

      <p>Experts say any change to the hepatitis B schedule could have significant and far-reaching consequences</p>
<p>Robert F Kennedy Jr’s vaccine advisory committee convenes on Thursday to consider a reversal of a decades-long program of childhood immunizations, including a recommendation to delay hepatitis B shots for newborn babies.</p>
<p>For decades, federal health recommendations have suggested that all newborns be vaccinated against the virus that can lead to serious liver disease. Kennedy, the US health secretary and a prominent anti-vaccine activist, has long pushed for delaying the shot.</p>

      <h1>Have we given up on data privacy?</h1>

(date: 2025-12-04)
      <p>
      <p>Every day, consumers are confronted with the fragility of our personal data privacy — another data breach, another government agency accessing databases they didn't previously have access to, another consent form popping up to get permission to gather more data.</p>
<p>It's almost too much for any one person to keep a handle on, according to Rohan Grover, professor of artificial intelligence and media at American University. He recently co-authored a piece for The Conversation about why data privacy seems to have largely fallen out of the public discourse, even though he says the topic is more urgent than ever.</p>

      <h1>Wilfried Nancy’s move to Celtic means as much for MLS as it does for him</h1>

(date: 2025-12-04)
      <p>
      <p>New Celtic manager may not be a big name but he won over the US league with leadership style and attractive football</p>
<p>Other managers won more in Major League Soccer than Wilfried Nancy. Bruce Arena, say, certainly has a fuller trophy cabinet. Nancy, however, lifted more than just trophies. He lifted standards. At Columbus Crew, he set a benchmark for the rest, showing what was possible even with limited resources. Columbus <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/nov/29/mls-cup-inter-miami-vancouver-whitecaps-san-diego-nycfc">didn’t have Lionel Messi</a> or Son Heung-min, but they had Nancy as head coach, and that was often enough.</p>
<p>For the past three seasons, the Crew have been the most dynamic, boundary-pushing team in MLS. Nancy’s CF Montreal team weren’t bad either, establishing the style of play that would come to be known as Nancyball. He changed MLS’s managerial landscape for ever. It was only a matter of time until a call came from Europe.</p>

      <h1>Jaxson Dart says the NFL ‘isn’t soccer’. The Giants need him to start acting like a quarterback</h1>

(date: 2025-12-04)
      <p>
      <p>The rookie plays like a linebacker at quarterback. His reckless style is costing his teammates and coaches as well as himself</p>
<p>Jaxson Dart wants you to know something: <em>this is real football</em>. It’s not soccer or flag. It’s tackle football, the kind where quarterbacks go airborne. After <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/01/patriots-giants-monday-night-football">taking the latest</a> in a growing compilation of bone-crushing hits, Dart brushed himself off and delivered a post-game sermon on toughness. “We’re not playing soccer,” he said. “You’re going to get hit. Things happen.”</p>
<p>Yet these “things” continue to happen to Dart at an alarming rate. In his eight NFL starts, he has absorbed as many unnecessary hits as any rookie quarterback in recent memory. On Monday night, Dart <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/01/patriots-giants-monday-night-football">took another heavy hit</a> near the sideline in the first quarter of the Giants’ 33-15 loss to the Patriots. Dart scrambled out of the pocket on second-and-13 and ran for a first down. As he approached the sideline, Dart could have stepped out and gained fewer yards while still moving the chains. Instead, he braced, lowered his shoulder and <a href="https://x.com/OmahaProd/status/1995670356674412922">was sent soaring through the air</a> by Patriots linebacker Christian Elliss.</p>

Critics are speaking out about the use of stock footage in the ads, saying it doesn’t actually show the Ring of Fire. Here's what we found out.</p>

<p>From hit dramas like Stranger Things and The Summer I Turned Pretty, to attention grabbing reality shows, many shows on streaming platforms that made their name on binge watching are now releasing episodes weekly or in bite-sized chunks. Experts say the format and social factors are driving some fans to catch episodes when they air, though with more flexibility than broadcast TV allows.</p>

      <h1>Pentagon watchdog finds Hegseth’s use of Signal posed risk to US personnel, AP sources say</h1>

(date: 2025-12-04)
      <p>
      <p>The Pentagon’s watchdog has found that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth put U.S. personnel and their mission at risk when he used the Signal messaging app to convey sensitive information about a military strike against Houthi militants in Yemen. That's according to two people familiar with the findings on Wednesday. One of the people says Hegseth, however, has the ability to declassify material and the report did not find he did so improperly. Hegseth denied posting classified information regarding plans for a military strike against Houthi militants in Yemen in March. The review by the Pentagon inspector general’s office was delivered to lawmakers, who were able to review the report in a classified facility at the Capitol.</p>

<p>In a statement, the department said <strong>Operation Catahoula Crunch</strong> would target “criminal illegal aliens roaming free thanks to sanctuary policies”. New Orleans is the latest Democratic-run city (albeit in a Republican-led state) to see federal immigration agents on its streets. Most recently, the Trump administration targeted Charlotte, North Carolina, and touted the arrest of more than 300 undocumented immigrants.</p>

(date: 2025-12-03)
      <p>
      <p>Small business owners’ economic moods remain mixed. But, as is so often the case, how folks feel is different from how they act. And hard data tells us small business owners are pulling back on hiring — one ADP report shows businesses with fewer than 50 employees cut a net 120,000 jobs in November. Should we be worried? Plus: Retailers benefit from buy now, pay later offerings, import prices sans fuel rose in September, and cap-and-trade carbon emissions programs have changed since their inception.</p>

      <h1>The Clippers’ chaotic unravelling leaves Chris Paul as its most painful casualty</h1>

(date: 2025-12-03)
      <p>
      <p>Los Angeles have turned a feelgood reunion into a late-career humiliation for one of their greatest players – and exposed a franchise stumbling into a darker new era</p>
<p>Pull out your Los Angeles Clippers bingo cards. Anyone have the square marked “owner and star player <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/03/clippers-deny-claims-star-forward-kawhi-leonard-was-paid-28m-for-job-that-didnt-exist">accused of skirting the salary cap</a> through improper means”? Go ahead and stamp that one. How about “losing 14 of 16 after a hopeful 3-2 start”? Mark it. And yes, you can fill in “other star averaging nearly 27 a night at age 36 – including a 50-piece against the Detroit Pistons, one of the league’s best teams”. The box reading “Clippers fans tearing out their hair at alarming rates and contemplating shameful, fairweather defections” is probably safe to cross off, pending review. And after the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/03/clippers-chris-paul-sent-home-stunning-late-night-move">wee-hours media cycle on Wednesday morning</a>, everyone gets to tick the most dispiriting square of all: “beloved, decorated veteran unceremoniously kicked to the curb in his final season”.</p>
<p>The Clippers had posted a winning record every year since 2010-11, building a reputation as one of the NBA’s most reliable playoff fixtures. Twenty-one games into this young season, that identity has dissolved into something hazy around the edges – and unmistakably sinister.</p>

Several photos show a room with a dentist chair and masks hanging on the wall. The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/28/business/jeffrey-epstein-island.html">reported</a> that Epstein’s last girlfriend was a dentist who shared an office with one of his shell companies.

      <h1>A fuel efficiency rollback</h1>

(date: 2025-12-03)
      <p>
      <p>President Donald Trump plans to announce weaker fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks at a White House event today. The move will likely reverse a Biden-era rule requiring automakers to reach an average of 50 miles per gallon for new vehicles by 2031. Plus, as part of <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/lunar-economy">our lunar economy series</a>, we hear how one company is recycling space debris into more useful products for the space industry.</p>

      <h1>Family of victim of Trump boat airstrikes files complaint against ‘extrajudicial killing’ | First Thing</h1>

(date: 2025-12-03)
      <p>
      <p>Alejandro Carranza Medina’s relatives say he was a fisher, not a drug trafficker. Plus, Putin says Russia ‘ready’ for war with Europe as Ukraine talks stall</p>

</ul>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>A family in Colombia has filed a petition with the Washington DC-based Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR), alleging that the Colombian citizen Alejandro Carranza Medina was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/02/trump-caribbean-drug-boat-attack-complaint">subject to an “extrajudicial killing”</a> in a US airstrike.</p>
<p><strong>What is the IACHR?</strong> A monitoring body designed to “promote and protect human rights in the western hemisphere”. The US is a member, and the state department said in March it was a “strong supporter of the IACHR”.</p>
<p><strong>H</strong> <strong>ow has the Trump administration responded?</strong> A White House spokesperson, Anna Kelly, did not respond directly to questions about the complaint or about Carranza’s death, but wrote in an email that the media were “now running cover for foreign terrorists smuggling deadly narcotics intended to murder Americans”.</p>
<p><strong>What’s the latest on the front</strong> <strong>lines?</strong> Buoyed up by recent gains, Putin has indicated in recent weeks that the Russian military was prepared to keep fighting if diplomacy faltered, repeatedly emphasising that his forces remained on the offensive on the battlefield.</p>

(date: 2025-12-03)
      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> European politicians have reached a provisional agreement to phase out imports of Russian gas by 2027. Exports of oil and gas have been crucial for Russia to fund its military campaign in Ukraine. Russia says Europe will be less competitive and that consumers will have to pay higher prices. Then, we'll check in on Japan's work-life balance and hear about a diamond-studded Faberge egg, which just sold at auction for $30 million.</p>

<p>Judge Thomas Schroeder is deliberating over the future of provisions in Senate bill 747, which increased registration requirements for voters who cast ballots on the same day they register to vote during North Carolina’s early voting period.

<p>Inside the store, which sits along a three-lane road in a county of peanut growers and poultry workers, Coffield scanned 300 items and recorded their shelf prices. He carried the scanned bar codes to the cashier and watched as item after item rang up at a higher price.</p>

<p>The Edmonton Police Service will test the use of bodycams that employ facial recognition, a form of artificial intelligence. Starting Wednesday, up to 50 police officers will use the cameras for the remainder of the month. However some academics warn that the technology is still not well-understood or reliable.</p>

(date: 2025-12-02)
      <p>
      <p>The Federal Reserve’s quantitative approach to monetary policy decisions means its governors tend to reach consensus. But in the past few meetings, some FOMC members have disagreed on whether to prioritize jobs or inflation. In this episode, “Marketplace” host Kai Ryssdal and former FOMC member Daniel Tarullo discuss why the Fed is divided right now. Plus: Dollar stores weather an uncertain economy, companies use return-to-office policies as a workforce reduction mechanism, and electricity demand grows as data centers pop up nationwide.</p>

<p>A tech billionaire and his wife said on Tuesday they would pour $6.25bn into individual investment accounts for 25 million children under 10, prompting a wave of new questions about how these so-called “Trump accounts” will work.</p>
<p>The creation of these accounts was included as part of Donald Trump’s sprawling tax and spending bill, which he signed into law in July. Every child born between 1 January 2025 and 31 December 2028, can receive a Trump account that includes a $1,000 initial deposit from the administration. The money will then be invested.</p>

<p>The Pentagon on Tuesday scapegoated a navy admiral for the extrajudicial double-tap strike that killed survivors of a 2 September attack on an alleged drug boat and vowed to continue operations, even as lawmakers investigate whether the attack constituted a war crime.</p>
<p>At a Pentagon briefing on Tuesday, Kingsley Wilson, the Pentagon press secretary said that the decision to re-strike the “narco terrorist vessel” was made by Adm Frank M Bradley, “operating under clear and long standing authorities to ensure the boat was destroyed and the threat to the United States was eliminated”. Wilson added that Pete Hegseth, the Pentagon secretary, “stands behind Admiral Bradley, 100%”.</p>

<p>The US Soccer Federation announced on Tuesday that the national team will play Belgium and Portugal in the March Fifa window, with both matches taking place at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta on 28 and 31 March, respectively. Those matches will be followed by two friendlies in the window immediately preceding the World Cup, with the second one coming against Germany in Chicago on 6 June. The first game of the pre-World Cup series is against an opponent to be determined in Charlotte, North Carolina, on 31 May. Multiple reports have indicated that the opponent will be announced after the World Cup draw. (Fifa rules forbid group opponents from playing each other in a friendly ahead of the tournament.)</p>

<p>The Pentagon said on Tuesday that every national guard member deployed in Washington DC would now be armed with live weapons, and that they had begun conducting joint patrols with the local police department.</p>
<p>“I can confirm that everybody in DC is now armed, and a lot of our DC national guardsmen are now also doing joint patrols with members of the police department here in DC,” said Kingsley Wilson, the defense department’s press secretary, at a press conference.</p>

<p>Serena Williams has taken the procedural move required of any player contemplating a competitive comeback, after the 23-time grand slam singles champion re-entered the International Tennis Integrity Agency’s (ITIA) registered testing pool for the first time since 2022.</p>
<p>Williams, 44, has not played an official match since <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/sep/02/serena-williams-ajla-tomljanovi-us-open-tennis-third-round-retirement">her run to the third round of the US Open</a> more than three years ago. Although she described her departure at the time as “evolving away” from the sport rather than a hard retirement, she filed the paperwork with the ITIA that September that exempted her from the sport’s stringent whereabouts requirements. To return to competition, however, players must make themselves available for out-of-competition testing for six months before they are allowed to enter an event.</p>

US citizenship and immigration services awarded him asylum earlier this year.</p>

      <p>Corporate bond spreads, extra compensation that corporate bonds pay out compared to government bonds, have been narrowing this year, which means investors aren’t demanding much additional money to account for additional credit risk. That could indicate that investors think economic growth could pick up in the near term.

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> The U.K. government has hailed a deal with the United States to keep tariffs on U.K. pharmaceutical shipments into the U.S. at zero, but the agreement comes with a cost. Then, Hong Kong's leader said serious problems in the city's construction industry, as well as oversight, were exposed in last week’s deadly high-rise fire. And, what's behind recruitment problems at Europe's air traffic control?</p>

<p>Police across Canada have seized hundreds of kilos of fentanyl and charged thousands of people over the course of a five-month bust the RCMP is describing as &quot;significant.&quot; But officials detailing the results of the blitz on Tuesday stressed that Canada is still not a major exporter of the drug, despite concerns raised by the U.S. administration.</p>

      <p>Your essential guide to Friday’s draw in Washington DC, including where to watch it, who to watch out for and a look at Fifa’s peace prize</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/world-cup-football">World Cup</a> draw will start at Washington DC’s Kennedy Center at 12pm local time on Friday 5 December (5pm GMT/4am Saturday AEST). Although don’t worry if you tune in late: based on previous draws there will be a few speeches about Fifa being on the verge of bringing about world peace via the medium of football, some interpretive dance about Fifa being on the verge of bringing about world peace via the medium of football, some videos with kids kicking a ball about to show that Fifa is on the verge of bringing about world peace via the medium of football, and then, hopefully, Fifa actually bringing about world peace via the medium of football. And if you miss any of that, don’t worry Fifa will also be awarding a peace prize to the person most likely to bring about world peace in the next few months (more on that zinger later). At some point in all of that, they’ll place teams into groups and at long last give this expanded tournament an actual schedule.</p>

(date: 2025-12-01)
      <p>
      <p>Michael Bohacek, an Indiana state senator, says US president’s ‘choices of words have consequences’</p>
<p>An <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/indiana">Indiana</a> Republican lawmaker whose child has Down syndrome has promised to oppose efforts to redraw the state’s congressional map to favor his party after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> aimed a slur for people with intellectual disabilities at a political opponent.</p>
<p>Michael Bohacek, a member of Indiana’s state senate, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MikeBohacekinSenate/posts/pfbid02JvGA2rTw6eXFre7SqwJZrMMxVpHXp8ShRdk2JAo2WUptNZrtCvW61Z1BVKeFBd3cl">wrote</a> Friday on Facebook that he has been “an unapologetic advocate for people with intellectual disabilities” since one of his daughters was born with Down. Referring to how the president used an ableist slur to insult Tim Walz, the Democratic Minnesota governor, a day earlier, Bohacek’s post added, “His choices of words have consequences.”</p>

      <h1>Fuzzy Zoeller obituary</h1>

(date: 2025-12-01)
      <p>
      <p>Popular American golfer hailed for winning the US Masters and the US Open</p>
<p>The golfer Fuzzy Zoeller, who has died aged 74, won two majors – the US Masters in 1979 and the US Open in 1984, both by virtue of a playoff. His Masters success was especially notable for the fact that it was Zoeller’s debut in the competition, making him the first golfer since 1935 (and still only the third) to win on his first appearance. He won the sudden-death playoff against Tom Watson and Ed Sneed with a par and a birdie, sinking a six-foot putt on the second extra hole and hurling his putter <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BC-pC_S6aTs">high into the air</a> as the ball disappeared into the cup.</p>
<p>Zoeller’s US Open victory at Winged Foot five years later was remembered for his light-hearted interaction with his play-off rival, Greg Norman. When Norman holed a lengthy putt on the last of the 72 holes, Zoeller, who was behind him on the fairway, mistakenly thought the Australian had gone into the lead, and waved a white towel in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye6_Mx9YmgU">mock surrender</a>. But Norman’s putt had only drawn him level, and Zoeller was able to secure a par on the last to maintain parity. During the subsequent 18-hole playoff, which Zoeller won by eight strokes, Norman returned the gesture by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qq6SG_Qzpxg">flapping</a> his own white towel at the 18th.</p>

<p>Residents have been staying in hotels since being evacuated Thursday afternoon, waiting to hear when they might be able to return home. Toronto's fire chief said Monday it is one of the most complex fires he's seen in his career, with crews struggling to access slow-burning material inside the walls between two buildings.</p>

      <h1>Purists be damned: why title-deciding playoffs make soccer sing | Leander Schaerlaeckens</h1>

(date: 2025-12-01)
      <p>
      <p>In MLS and NWSL alike, edge-of-your-seat contests have delivered indelible moments that even the best title race run-in can’t match</p>
<p>There’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAx6vDNKVAo">a TV commercial</a> that’s been running on Apple TV during MLS games for Lowe’s hardware stores. Lionel Messi carefully places a soccer ball on a field, ready to take a free kick. He is flanked by Lionel Messi and Lionel Messi. On the sideline, manager Lionel Messi, assisted by Lionel Messi, gesticulates. Lionel Messi lays off the ball for Lionel Messi, who crosses it to Lionel Messi. Lionel Messi chests and volleys it into the net and is mobbed by another half dozen Lionel Messis (or is it Lionels Messi?).</p>
<p>Facing Inter Miami in the ongoing MLS playoffs must feel more or less like living inside this ad. Before Saturday’s Eastern Conference final against New York City FC, Messi had either scored or assisted on all 12 goals Miami had scored in the postseason. Messi has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/24/lionel-messi-mls-viewership-attendance-apple-tv">smashed up the league</a> this year, but he has saved the real savagery for the playoffs.</p>

      <h1>In the NFL’s season of meh, even the battered 49ers are Super Bowl contenders</h1>

(date: 2025-12-01)
      <p>
      <p>San Francisco are a flawed team with serious injuries. But with no great teams in the league this year, the playoffs are wide open</p>
<p>The 49ers’ season felt over after <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401772749/49ers-buccaneers">Week 6’s loss to Tampa Bay</a>. Yes, they were 4-2. Yes, they were tied with the Seahawks and Rams and had already won head-to-head games against both. But that’s when they hit rock bottom. All Pro linebacker Fred Warner <a href="https://ninerswire.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/niners/2025/11/28/49ers-fred-warner-injury-update/87510140007/">was the latest casualty</a>, following <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/49ers/article/49ers-star-nick-bosa-spotted-walking-no-crutches-21165974.php">in the footsteps</a> of All Pro edge rusher Nick Bosa with a season-ending injury. Brock Purdy had also struggled with injuries. George Kittle was hurt in Week 1. Both were not expected to return for several games. Brandon Aiyuk had no plans to play any time soon, at least not for San Francisco. By Week 7, the only big names in action were Christian McCaffrey and Trent Williams.</p>
<p>Dire as the 49ers appeared on paper, they hung in. It helped that the Cardinals, Falcons, Giants, and Panthers featured in their upcoming schedule. They beat all four of them, losing only to the Texans and Rams in the next few weeks. None of the wins inspired much confidence, though. The Cardinals outgained the 49ers by 200 yards. Purdy threw three interceptions against the Panthers.</p>

<p>Over the weekend, Donald Trump declared on Truth Social that the airspace around Venezuela should be considered closed. Venezuela’s foreign ministry responded by calling the comments &quot;another extravagant, illegal and unjustified aggression against the Venezuelan people&quot;.
Late last week, Trump also said that land action against alleged drug trafficking networks in the country could start very soon.
All of this is happening amidst a serious military buildup in the Caribbean and escalating threats to remove Venezuela’s president Nicolas Maduro from power.
Is this the buildup to an invasion? And is it really about drugs? Or do Venezuela's massive oil reserves have something to do with it?
Jon Lee Anderson is our guest. He’s a staff writer with The New Yorker, and has written extensively about U.S.-Venezuela relations and U.S. interference in Latin America.

Urgences-santé, meanwhile, insists there’s been no impact on patient care since the system was implemented.</p>

<p>Bryce Young excels in Carolina victory</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bills QB scores record 76th rushing touchdown</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Bryce Young completed 15 of 20 passes for 206 yards and three touchdowns – two of them coming on fourth down – and the Carolina Panthers (7-6) forced three turnovers by Matthew Stafford to beat Los Angeles (9-3) and snap the Rams’ six-game winning streak. Carolina’s defense intercepted Stafford twice with Mike Jackson returning one for a 48-yard touchdown and ended the 37-year-old’s NFL record of 28 straight TD passes without an interception. Derrick Brown, who tipped a ball resulting in one of Stafford’s first pick, came up with a key strip-sack with 2:25 left in the game to preserve the win. Stafford completed 18 of 28 passes for 243 yards with two touchdown passes to Davante Adams, his 13th and 14th of the season.</p>

      <h1>A teenager redrew the Alabama voting map – and it’s now state law</h1>

(date: 2025-11-30)
      <p>
      <p>Daniel DiDonato, 18, drafted new state senate districts at home on free software – and a judge picked his map ahead of professionals’ efforts to remedy voting rights violations</p>
<p>Earlier this month, after years of litigation, a federal judge in Alabama ordered a new state senate map. In a surprising decision, the map she chose wasn’t one drafted by a court-appointed special master and his expert cartographer, but rather one that had been submitted by an anonymous member of the public, known only by their initials, “DD”.</p>
<p>The decision stunned “DD” – an 18-year-old freshman at the University of Alabama named Daniel DiDonato – who learned his map had been selected as he was preparing to leave for his 9.30am introduction to political science class.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Parts of the US economy are doing just fine but many are struggling to make rent, let alone splurging on gifts</p>
<p>Will retailers and merchants have a strong holiday season? That depends. This year, more than most, the 2025 holiday season will actually be two holiday seasons.</p>
<p>If your business caters to higher-income individuals or if you’re located in a wealthier part of the country, you’ll probably have a decent holiday season. True, even the wealthy are cutting back. But according to the HR firm ADP average salaries have risen between 4.5% and 6.7% depending on whether workers stayed or switched jobs. The stock markets, though increasingly volatile, are up over 13% since the beginning of the year. And in <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/rankings/opportunity/economic-opportunity/household-income">some parts of the country</a>, notably New York, Boston, DC and San Francisco, the average household income is over <span class="math inline">\(125,000 - almost \)</span>41,000 higher than the national average. People in this demographic may be a little more cautious but they’ll spend.</p>

      <p>Former oversight officials alarmed by dismantling of DHS system that oversees complaints about civil rights harms</p>
<p>The federal watchdog system at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that oversees complaints about civil rights violations, including in immigration detention, has been gutted so thoroughly that it could be laying the groundwork for the Trump administration to “abuse people with impunity”, experts warn.</p>
<p>Former federal oversight officials have sounded the alarm at the rapid dismantling of guardrails against human rights failures – at the same time as the government <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/21/deportations-us-government-shutdown-ice-data">pushes</a> aggressive <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usimmigration">immigration</a> enforcement operations.</p>
<p>Border Patrol agents in Arizona forcibly removed a detained man from a cell, handcuffed him and then injected him with ketamine to sedate him in 2023, according to a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26301388-cbp-ketamine-memo/">CRCL document</a> confirming the watchdog’s investigation into the allegation. A Guardian reporter had saved that document just weeks before it was scrubbed from the DHS’s website.</p>
<p>Guards at a privately owned Louisiana detention center systematically mistreated detained immigrants, according to a CRCL <a href="https://rfkhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/assets/Pepper-spray-Incident-CRCL-Complaint-Winn_3.27.24.pdf">document</a>.This included an investigation into a <a href="https://theappeal.org/biden-admin-extended-contract-abusive-ice-detention-center/">2024 incident</a> during which correctional staff pepper sprayed around 200 detained immigrants who were staging a hunger strike in protest of detention conditions. Guards then allegedly locked the men in the unit and cut the power and water for hours. A majority of the men were allegedly denied medical care, the original <a href="https://rfkhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/assets/Pepper-spray-Incident-CRCL-Complaint-Winn_3.27.24.pdf">complaint</a>, submitted to the CRCL by RFK Human Rights, said.</p>
<p>In a Florida jail, a 33-year-old immigrant woman with mental health problems was forcibly stripped naked, strapped to a restraint chair and mocked by male guards, according to a CRCL <a href="https://www.aclufl.org/app/uploads/2024/11/anas_crcl_final_version.pdf">complaint</a> submitted by the ACLU of Florida and RFK Human Rights. The woman was allegedly left with “contusions and marks on her body” after hours in the restraint chair. The whistleblower declaration said the CRCL had launched an investigation into the case.</p>
<p>Agents violated due process during the arrest and detention of Palestinian student and Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil, according to the whistleblower <a href="https://whistleblower.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/05-15-2025-GovAcctProj-Whistleblower-Disclosures-to-Congress-re-CRCL.pdf">complaint</a>.</p>

(date: 2025-11-30)
      <p>
      <p>From Vietnam to the Balkans, Donald Trump’s family has launched a global dealmaking blitz since his re-election</p>
<p>A crusading prosecutor in the Balkans comes under pressure to drop a big case. Vietnamese villagers learn they are to be evicted. A convicted crypto kingpin in the Gulf receives a pardon.</p>
<p>All have one thing in common: they appear to be connected to the Trump family’s campaign to amass riches around the world. Since Donald Trump’s re-election a year ago, warnings that his use of presidential power to advance personal interests is corroding American democracy have grown ever louder. What is less understood – and perhaps even more dangerous – is the damage this is doing everywhere else.</p>

So this week, the EU announced plans to ban social media platforms from providing financial or material incentives for kidfluencing. Experts says Canada needs to come up with its own law.</p>

      <p>President made declaration in a social media post, after FAA last week warned airlines of ‘worsening security situation’</p>
<p>The Venezuelan government has responded defiantly to the heightened pressure by the US government, including Donald Trump’s recent statements on Saturday that the airspace above and surrounding Venezuela is to be closed in its entirety.</p>
<p>In a statement, the Venezuelan government said Trump’s comments are a “colonialist threat” against their sovereignty and violate international law. The government also said it demanded respect for its airspace and would not accept foreign orders or threats.</p>

<p>Donald Trump’s administration had cut off $790m in grants in a standoff that contributed to university layoffs and the resignation in September of Northwestern’s president, Michael Schill. The administration argued the school had not done enough to fight antisemitism.</p>

      <p>People implicated in the late sex offender’s crimes could face criminal charges or, at the least, social ostracism</p>
<p>As the clock ticks toward the congressionally mandated deadline of 19 December by which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s justice department must release its files related to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a>, there is intense speculation about the contents of these documents – but also questions as to what happens when they are released.</p>
<p>The US president on 19 November signed a bipartisan bill requiring that the US attorney general, Pam Bondi, disclose these documents to the US public within 30 days. Given that other tranches of materials related to the disgraced financier included damning correspondence with high-profile individuals, many expect that still more names of the rich, famous and powerful will be named.</p>

      <h1>Trump’s hate-filled rant ignores facts on immigrant crime and economic benefits</h1>

(date: 2025-11-29)
      <p>
      <p>In the wake of the deadly Washington DC shooting, Trump claimed immigrants are ‘destroying everything America stands for’. Here’s what the data shows</p>
<p>Donald Trump’s hateful, falsehood-filled rant on Thursday blaming immigrants for crime, “social dysfunction” and economic hardship is refuted by a wide range of immigration statistics, which show clearly that immigrants dramatically <a href="https://www.migrationpolicy.org/content/explainer-immigrants-and-us-economy">bolster the US economy</a> and commit crimes at far <a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/curiosity/blog/do-immigrants-get-incarcerated-more">lower rates</a> than people born in the US.</p>
<p>On Thursday evening, Trump condemned immigrants in <a href="https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1994262111145365516">a broad and vicious invective</a>, painting them as “illegal and disruptive populations” and attacking “those that hate, steal, murder and destroy everything that America stands for”. He vowed to block all migration from “third world countries” to allow the “US system to fully recover”.</p>

      <p>Some small business owners doubt that even strong holiday sales will ease impact of tough year plagued by uncertainty</p>
<p>Donald Trump’s tariffs have increased prices on an array of popular holiday goods and driven a “massive” number of small firms out of business, industry leaders have warned.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://www.sba.gov/about-sba/organization/observances/small-business-saturday">Small Business Saturday</a>, firms have their fingers crossed that strong holiday sales will ease the impact of a tough year. But many aren’t holding their breath.</p>

      <p>Next nominee faces enormous task of leading a party that has been entirely reoriented around Trump</p>
<p>Donald Trump hasn’t stopped joking about running again for the White House in 2028, even as he acknowledges it is “pretty clear” he is constitutionally ineligible for a third term. Whether intended as a taunt or a threat, his musings are a reminder that, even barred from the ballot, Trump is likely to remain a central figure in the campaign to succeed him.</p>
<p>The next Republican nominee faces the potentially enormous task of leading a party that has been entirely reoriented around Trump into a post-Trump era. Here’s a look at the Republicans best positioned for a White House run.</p>

<p>Four million people pour into Banff National Park each year — a level of visitation the park’s first wardens could never have imagined in 1885. As Banff turns 140, Parks Canada is rethinking what it means to welcome so many people while still protecting the landscape for future generations.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> has declared he intends to cancel most of the executive orders signed by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden">Joe Biden</a>, his predecessor as president of the United States.</p>
<p>In a post on social media, Trump claimed baselessly that Biden had not signed off on the orders himself, saying that “the radical left lunatics circling Biden around the beautiful Resolute Desk in the Oval Office took the Presidency away from him” by signing his name using an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/28/republicans-biden-autopen">autopen</a> – a signature machine that has commonly been used by US presidents since the device’s invention.</p>

      <h1>Fewer one night stands, more AI lovers: the data behind generation Z’s sex lives</h1>

(date: 2025-11-28)
      <p>
      <p>Shaped by lockdown and two Trump presidencies, gen Z are grappling with a lot in love, dating and the bedroom</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/the-sex-lives-of-gen-z">The sex lives of gen Z</a> are of great interest – to politicians, to parents, to influencers and dating app executives and to you, apparently. Are gen Z so lonely they are falling in love with AI robots? Are they forming polycules across the US? Are they having enough sex? Are they having sex at all?</p>
<p>Gen Z is defined roughly as young Americans aged 13 to 28. This generation came of age with information about sex readily available to them, for better (the internet provides both sex education and community) and arguably for worse, too (in 2022, 54% of US teens <a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/sites/default/files/research/report/2022-teens-and-pornography-final-web.pdf">reported</a> first seeing online pornography at age 13 or younger). They are more likely to embrace non-traditional identities and are progressive on issues such as abortion rights and same-sex marriage – especially gen Z women.</p>

<p>Some Liberal MPs are insisting their caucus remains united despite Steven Guilbeault’s decision to quit cabinet over Prime Minister Mark Carney’s deal with Alberta that could lead to a pipeline to the B.C. coast.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Mark Carney and Alberta Premier Danielle Smith on Thursday signed a memorandum of understanding for a new pipeline agreement. Several B.C. chiefs say their 'answer is still no,' and vow to use 'every tool in our toolbox' to stop the project. We speak with Riley Yesno, a University of Toronto lecturer and Indigenous rights activist, about the reaction from Indigenous communities and what the deal could mean for negotiations going forward.</p>

And while Black Friday may be dominated by the Targets and Walmarts of the world, millions of shoppers will go to mom-and-pop retailers on Small Business Saturday. We'll preview this weekend's retail extravaganza. Also, Social Security benefits can act as a financial buoy for the children and spouses of deceased individuals.</p>

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney has struck a deal for a 700-mile pipeline carrying 1 million barrels of oil a day to Canada's West Coast in an attempt to pivot away from reliance on the U.S. economy. The project is likely to face multiple legal challenges, however. Plus, Kenyan farmers have won a case over food sovereignty and a Russian &quot;shadow fleet&quot; is suspected of covertly generating billions for Moscow.</p>

<p>Donald Trump has said he will <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/28/trump-says-he-will-permanently-pause-migration-from-third-world-countries-after-national-guard-shooting">“permanently pause migration from all third world countries”</a>, a day after two national guard members were shot in Washington DC in an attack that authorities suspect was carried out by an Afghan national.</p>
<p><strong>What do we know about the other guard member?</strong> Andrew Wolfe, 24, is still fighting for his life, according to the president.</p>
<p><strong>What does Trump mean by</strong> <strong>‘third world</strong> <strong>’?</strong> He did not identify the countries he intended to target or specify what he meant by the phrase.</p>
<p><strong>What has Warren said about Staley?</strong> She said he allegedly protected Epstein’s access to the banking system while working at JP Morgan in the early 2000s.</p>

<p>In 2022, Disney <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/17/disney-california-storyliving-community-rancho-mirage">announced plans to build a first-of-its-kind branded residential community</a>, which they have named “Storyliving by Disney”. The first of the Storyliving communities, Cotino, is officially welcoming residents into model homes in Rancho Mirage, a city nestled in Coachella valley. When all plans are finished, the 618-acre community will feature almost 2,000 residential units, including single-family homes and condos.</p>

      <p>The one-act play Oh, Mary! – ‘the stupidest, funniest thing possible’ – to open after blockbuster run in New York</p>
<p>What if, in the final weeks before Abraham Lincoln’s assassination, the first lady could not care less about the American civil war and was instead hell-bent on becoming a cabaret star?</p>
<p>That is the question posed by Oh, Mary!, the smash-hit show that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/article/2024/jul/11/oh-mary-review-cole-escola-broadway">reimagines Mary Todd Lincoln as a gloriously unhinged alcoholic</a> who despises her closeted husband.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Ex-member of the hip-hop group was convicted of money laundering and campaign finance violations after funneling money from a rich Malaysian</p>
<p>From the moment the Fugees shot to fame in the mid-90s, Prakazrel “Pras” Michél was discounted as an incidental member of the hip-hop superstars. He was the unremarkable New Jersey rhyme spitter by way of Brooklyn who was lucky enough to be a high school classmate of the mesmerizing Lauryn Hill and a cousin to mercurial Wyclef Jean. On the group’s breakout album The Score, Michel’s eight-bar features were minor contributions, relative to Hill’s adroitness as an emcee and balladeer and Jean’s compositional polymathy.</p>
<p>“From Hawaii to Hawthorne, I run marathons, like / Buju Banton, I’m a true champion, like / Farrakhan reads his daily Qur’an / It’s a phenomenon, lyrics fast like Ramadan,” Michél raps on the band’s breakout single Fu-Gee-La, in one of his more pedestrian efforts.</p>

      <h1>AI's role in improving accessibility</h1>

(date: 2025-11-28)
      <p>
      <p>Accessibility has long been aided by the advancement of technology. When it comes to artificial intelligence, accessibility is top of mind for Taylor Arndt, Chief Operations Officer at Techopolis Online Solutions. Arndt has been blind since birth, and so accessibility has been a lifelong battle. When she was in school, she often received physical materials she was unable to read. So, she bought her own hand-held scanner and downloaded a screen reader. At 14, Arndt taught herself to code. Now as a coder working on AI, Arndt says in order for it to help others, the AI models need to be trained on data that has already incorporated accessibility measures.</p>

      <h1>From value-adds to networking superconductor: how the weird language of tech dulled sport | Aaron Timms</h1>

(date: 2025-11-28)
      <p>
      <p>Tech investors promise to disrupt everything from padel to basketball, but their pitch-deck jargon is slowly draining the humanity from sport itself</p>
<p>Finally, a sector more ludicrously hyped than AI. Speaking to Yahoo Sports recently about the launch of Project B, a startup global women’s basketball league, co-founder Grady Burnett <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/wnba/article/project-bs-ambitious-plans-to-reshape-womens-basketball--and-mens-too-154515719.html?guccounter=1">declared</a> that “women’s basketball is growing right now as fast as AI”. Come again? There’s no question that women’s basketball is growing nicely, a development that we should all cheer: this year’s WNBA season <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6723196/2025/10/16/wnba-ratings-viewers-2025-espn/">was the most watched ever</a>. But it is testing credulity to suggest that the sport is growing at anything like the same speed as AI, which since 2022 has gone from the technological margins to the very center of the US economy: by some reports, AI spending <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/how-the-u-s-economy-became-hooked-on-ai-spending-4b6bc7ff?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqfMMCxS4r_ieg846SmpYKXhi83N1_tT61NOcsbRXULw8ktKqwDjOYP2H1wttBw%3D&amp;gaa_ts=69250fa1&amp;gaa_sig=Xrvi-BHzE-4FtB6LgCkDcmZt9F_poOWghzsRHaRyHY7Bwc9pNrLgQZGEA4YxpLdkr7dqDpeqztjVKMWqdgEQ0w%3D%3D">accounted for</a> half of the growth in US GDP in the first half of this year. Perhaps I’m missing the real story here and the Federal Reserve is actively keeping tabs on attendance figures at Washington Mystics v Golden State Valkyries games for signs of potential overheating in the US economy. But it seems unlikely.</p>
<p>Claims like Burnett’s are par for the course in the hyperventilating world of sports investment, in which new leagues intent on world domination are launched seemingly every week and the pitches, delivered at investment conferences by slick men with gleaming teeth and spotless sneakers, grow more and more clammily self-satisfied by the hour. Burnett’s league, which he co-founded with former Skype co-founder Geoff Prentice, was briefly associated with Maverick Carter and LeBron James over the summer but that pair now seems <a href="https://www.thebiglead.com/lebron-james-partner-maverick-carter-reportedly-leaves-5-billion-nba-rival-project/">to have been removed</a> from the picture, and the league is emerging from “stealth mode”, to use a wormy bit of tech jargon, as the pure, uncut essence of bored Silicon Valley rich guy calculation. In a crowded field, Project B may be the most insanely overcaffeinated, tech bro-addled pitch for a new sports league yet.</p>

      <p>
      <p>As navies seek to counter submarines and protect cables, startups and big defence companies fight to lead market</p>
<p>Flying drones used during the Ukraine war have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/06/drones-evolving-technology-at-ukraine-conflict-heart">changed land battle tactics</a> for ever. Now the same thing appears to be happening under the sea.</p>
<p>Navies around the world are racing to add autonomous submarines. The UK’s Royal Navy is planning a fleet of underwater uncrewed vehicles (UUVs) which will, for the first time, take a leading role in tracking submarines and protecting undersea cables and pipelines. Australia has committed to spending $1.7bn (£1.3bn) <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/sep/10/ghost-shark-submarine-drone-australian-navy-explainer">on “Ghost Shark” submarines</a> to counter Chinese submarines. The huge US Navy is spending billions on several UUV projects, including one already in use that can be launched from nuclear submarines.</p>

      <p>Study finds that a week of political content can bring about a shift in views that previously would have taken three years</p>
<p>Small changes to the tone of posts fed to users of X can increase feelings of political polarisation as much in a week as would have historically taken at least three years, research has found.</p>
<p>A groundbreaking experiment to gauge the potency of Elon Musk’s social platform to increase political division found that when posts expressing anti-democratic attitudes and partisan animosity were boosted, even barely perceptibly, in the feeds of Democrat and Republican supporters there was a large change in their unfavourable feelings towards the other side.</p>

      <h1>Washington DC national guard shooting: what we know so far</h1>

(date: 2025-11-27)
      <p>
      <p>On Wednesday, Rahmanullah Lakanwal shot troop members Sarah Beckstrom and Andrew Wolfe</p>
<p>Two national guard members shot on Wednesday in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/washington-dc">Washington DC</a> are in critical condition. Here’s what we know so far:</p>
<p>At 2.15pm on Wednesday, a man is alleged to have launched what Jeanine Pirro, the US attorney for the District of Columbia, has called an “ambush-style” gun attack two blocks north-west of the White House on two members of the West Virginia national guard.</p>
<p>The guard members – named as Sarah Beckstrom, 20, and Andrew Wolfe, 24, both newly sworn-in – are currently <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/26/national-guard-soldiers-shot-washington-dc">hospitalized in critical condition</a>.</p>
<p>The suspect, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/27/washington-dc-national-guard-shooting-suspect">Rahmanullah Lakanwal</a>, 29, was shot at the scene by a third guard member and is being treated in hospital after being arrested. His wounds are not believed to be life-threatening.</p>
<p>Lakanwal faces charges of assault with intent to kill while armed and possession of a firearm during a crime of violence, though if the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/26/white-house-washington-national-guard">national guard members</a> die, the charges could be upgraded to first-degree murder.</p>
<p>His motives remain unclear: Pirro has said that “it’s too soon to say” and Jeffery Carroll, an executive assistant DC police chief, said that investigators had no information on a motive and the suspect “came around the corner” and immediately started firing at the troops.</p>
<p>He had driven across the US from the home he shares with his wife and five children in Bellingham, Washington state, allegedly to conduct the attack.</p>
<p>He is believed to have acted alone.</p>
<p>Lakanwal worked with the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/27/washington-dc-national-guard-shooting-suspect">CIA in Afghanistan</a>, and came to the US in 2021 as part of a program to resettle Afghans who had aided US operations there. The CIA director, John Ratcliffe, said Lakanwal was “a member of a partner force in Kandahar”.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> has responded to the shooting by ordering 500 more national guard members to Washington, and calling for the reinvestigation of all Afghan refugees who entered under the Biden administration.</p>
<p>US citizenship and immigration services also <a href="https://x.com/USCIS/status/1993882694640415163">said</a> it has stopped processing all immigration requests for Afghan nationals “pending further review of security and vetting protocols”.</p>

      <p>It's been almost three years since ChatGPT went live to the world, and it quickly became a helper or shortcut for students. (Ora tool to cheat.) Like it or not, artificial intelligence is with us. Today, we hear the story of one educator who's trying to prepare her students to use AI responsibly. Plus, professional soccer in Britain has long attracted foreign investment — increasingly from folks Stateside. We'll learn how Americans' involvement is shaping the game.</p>

<p>'The prices at which you’re allowing tickets to be re-sold is vile and completely against our wishes,' U.K. musician and breakout star Olivia Dean said of Ticketmaster on Instagram last week. Ticketmaster and parent company Live Nation said they’ll limit the ability to resell tickets above face value going forward, and will refund fans the difference.</p>

(date: 2025-11-27)
      <p>
      <p>Maher Tarabishi was arrested at a routine visit despite decades in the US, leaving his son with Pompe disease</p>
<p>A 62-year-old father named Maher Tarabishi visited the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ice-us-immigration-and-customs-enforcement">ICE</a> field office in Dallas, Texas, on 28 October as he has done each year for 17 years. Tarabishi, originally from Jordan, is in the US on a supervision order. Even though his asylum claim was denied, the US government allowed him to remain in the country because he is the primary caretaker for his son, Wael, who was diagnosed at four years old with a progressive muscle disorder called Pompe disease.</p>
<p>Tarabishi’s mandatory annual visits to ICE were never eventful; he’d arrive, an official might ask about Wael’s condition, and then he would leave. This time was different.</p>

Six Flags is hoping new CEO John Reilly, a veteran theme park operator, will help boost ticket sales and revenue.

      <h1>A tax-raising budget for the U.K.</h1>

(date: 2025-11-27)
      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> The U.K. government's economic outlook response document was accidentally published a half hour early on Wednesday, before Finance Minister Rachel Reeves began her 2025 budget speech. Reeves set out a string of tax hikes, which will bring the country's tax take to an all-time high of 38% of GDP in the coming years. Plus, we take a look at why U.S. investors have soccer in their sights.</p>

      <h1>Meet the NFL outsiders: the players and coaches not born in the USA</h1>

(date: 2025-11-27)
      <p>
      <p>A few years ago James Cook worked in a Surrey cinema and Max Pircher played in Austria. Now they’re in the NFL</p>
<p>By <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nohelmetsrequiredbook">No Helmets Required</a></p>
<p>The United States is a country of immigrants but the NFL remains dominated by players born in the USA. Only 5% of players are born abroad and the majority of them make the step into the sport by going to college in the US. True outsiders are unusual and foreign coaches are especially rare, which makes James Cook’s story remarkable.</p>
<p>Cook has been in charge of player development at Cleveland Browns for the past six months. That’s an achievement in itself but it’s extraordinary considering he grew up in Surrey, is in his late 20s and never played professional sport. Cook discovered the NFL as a 12-year-old when he was channel-flicking with his dad and came across “this weird and wonderful” sport. He started playing locally and soon wanted to become the first NFL quarterback born in Europe. He got as far as playing for Great Britain but his plans to go to college in the US proved financially prohibitive.</p>

      <h1>The Super Bowl Shuffle at 40: how a goofy rap classic boosted the Bears’ title run</h1>

(date: 2025-11-27)
      <p>
      <p>A new documentary charts how a song that featured a 335lb rapper and bad dancing went viral in the pre-internet era</p>
<p>The Chicago Bears are 8-3 and soaring in <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/standings">this season’s NFL standings</a>. For a fanbase that’s grown accustomed to looking up at the division rival Green Bay Packers and looking ahead to the next season’s prospects, it’s reason to smell the roses and indulge in some light strutting. But even as fans find themselves looking forward to the Bears’ first playoff berth in five years, something that once seemed unthinkable with a second-year quarterback and a rookie head coaching helming a squad that managed only five wins last year, no fan is thinking the 2025 Bears have a Super Bowl run in them – not without a rap song to lay the marker down.</p>
<p>Before the 1985 edition of the Bears romped to victory in Super Bowl XX, they tempted fate by recording The Super Bowl Shuffle. Although the song only peaked at 41 on the Billboard Hot 100 charts, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooT_uz--O2A&amp;t=3s">the accompanying video</a> came to rival Michael Jackson’s Thriller for popularity as it popped up endlessly on TV during the Bears’ title run. “The Super Bowl Shuffle went viral in an age where there was no viral existence like we know it today,” the song’s recording engineer, Fred Breitberg, says. “It was a phenomenal entity as well as being a good record.”</p>

<p>The new map takes aim at North Carolina’s only swing seat, currently held by Democrat Don Davis, an African American who represents more than 20 counties in the state’s north-east. The first district has been represented by Black members of Congress continuously for more than 30 years.</p>

<p>The Trump administration’s ICE raids across southern California have had disastrous effects on the region’s immigrants and swept up US citizens in the process, community leaders and residents said at a congressional hearing in Los Angeles on Monday.</p>

She said she was charged with assaulting an officer and held for two days in a federal detention center, where detainees had to pay for a cup in order to have water. The charges against her were ultimately dismissed due to what <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/05/us-citizens-jailed-ice-los-angeles">her attorney described</a> as a lack of evidence.</p>

      <h1>‘Traitor’: US representatives call for Trump envoy Witkoff to be fired after leaked Kremlin call</h1>

(date: 2025-11-26)
      <p>
      <p>Republicans and Democrats warn Witkoff ‘cannot be trusted’ after reportedly advising officials on peace plan</p>
<p>A handful of US representatives have reacted furiously to a leaked recording in which the special envoy to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a> reportedly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/25/trump-envoy-on-russia-ukraine-peace-deal">coached</a> Moscow on how to handle <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>, but most have so far remained mute on the revelation that American officials were advising a US adversary.</p>
<p>Don Bacon, a Republican representative, called for Steve Witkoff’s immediate dismissal. “For those who oppose the Russian invasion and want to see Ukraine prevail as a sovereign &amp; democratic country, it is clear that Witkoff fully favors the Russians,” the Nebraska lawmaker <a href="https://x.com/RepDonBacon/status/1993446393076498714?s=20">wrote on X</a>.</p>

      <h1>Noem made decision to continue deportation flights to El Salvador, justice department says</h1>

(date: 2025-11-26)
      <p>
      <p>Justice department maintains that Trump administration didn’t violate judge’s order to return flights to US</p>
<p>The Department of Justice said in a statement that Kristi Noem, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, was the one who made the decision to continue with the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/16/deportation-alleged-gang-members-el-salvador">deportation flights</a> of Venezuelan immigrants to El Salvador in March, despite a federal judge’s directive that the flights must be returned to the United States.</p>
<p>In a court <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.278436/gov.uscourts.dcd.278436.195.0.pdf">filing</a> on Tuesday, the justice department said that “Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche and Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove provided DHS with legal advice regarding the court’s order as to flights that had left the United States before the order issued, through DHS Acting General Counsel Joseph Mazzara” and that “after receiving that legal advice, Secretary Noem directed that the AEA detainees who had been removed from the United States before the Court’s order could be transferred to the custody of El Salvador”.</p>

      <h1>A tricky time to be a recent college grad</h1>

(date: 2025-11-26)
      <p>
      <p>New research from the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland finds that earning a college degree can still help you keep a job and get higher wages, but it’s less of an advantage than it used to be. ​The unemployment gap between college graduates and those with just a high school diploma is narrowing. Also: a handful of stocks driving economic growth, a potential trade agreement between the U.S. and Taiwan, and life as a 67-year-old retiree.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Katie Wilson’s rise from transit campaigner to city hall shows how trust, volunteers and years of organizing overcame big-money politics</p>
<p>While a blue wave was sweeping key races in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york">New York</a> City, Virginia, and New Jersey on 4 November, Seattle progressives were biting their nails down to a quick. At 8pm, only the first round of ballots had been counted in Seattle, and Katie Wilson, a longtime community organizer and the progressive challenger in the mayoral race, was behind by seven points.</p>
<p>But it was far from over. Because Washington tate votes almost entirely by mail, that first ballot count was less than a quarter of the vote. As the week wore on, and progressives’ fingernails disappeared, Wilson’s share of the vote crept up, slowly but steadily. Eight days after the election, Seattle declared that Wilson would be the next mayor of Seattle.</p>

<p>“Open Society Foundations supports the right of free speech, supports the constitutional rights of organizations to be able to organize themselves, including through peaceful protest and is willing to actually ensure that those rights are upheld, including by going to court if need be,” she said.</p>

<p>Stranger Things fans will finally get some answers when Season 5 drops today — but that's not stopping them from speculating about who might die or how the show’s villains might be defeated. They say whether they’re right or wrong, it's fun to predict how the beloved series will come to a close.</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>Donald Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, told a senior Kremlin official last month that achieving peace in Ukraine <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/25/trump-envoy-on-russia-ukraine-peace-deal">would require Russia gaining control of Donetsk</a> and potentially a separate territorial exchange, according to a recording of their conversation.</p>
<p><strong>What did Witkoff say?</strong> “Now, me to you, I know what it’s going to take to get a peace deal done: Donetsk and maybe a land swap somewhere,” Witkoff told Ushakov during the five-minute conversation, according to a transcript of the recording obtained by Bloomberg. “But I’m saying instead of talking like that, let’s talk more hopefully because I think we’re going to get to a deal here.”</p>

<p><strong>What has changed?</strong> It marks a sharp departure from Donald Trump’s narrative to the public every time he has discussed the 21 strikes that have killed more than 80 people, which he has portrayed as an effort to stop overdose deaths.</p>
<p><strong>What have the White House said?</strong> A White House official responded that Trump had not been making a legal argument. Still, the president’s remarks remain the only public reason for why the US is firing missiles – when the legal justification is in fact very different.</p>

<p>Newfoundland and Labrador's sea urchin fishery is on the verge of collapse, as the fish harvesters and divers are confined to certain overfished areas, says Jerry and Alisha Hodder, owners of one of the province's last urchin plants. They say DFO could fix the problem with the stroke of a pen.</p>

      <p>Democratic lawmakers who appeared in a social media video urging U.S. troops to defy “illegal orders” say the FBI has contacted them to begin scheduling interviews. It comes a day after the Pentagon announced it is investigating Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona over potential violations of military law. Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin told reporters Tuesday that Trump “is attempting to use the FBI to scare us.” The inquiries mark an extraordinary escalation for federal law enforcement and military institutions that traditionally steer clear of partisan clashes.</p>

<p>The legal analysis rests on a premise – for which there is no immediate public evidence – that the cartels are waging armed violence against the security forces of allies like Mexico, and that the violence is financed by cocaine shipments.</p>

<p>Like a startled turkey flapping in zigzags, the US president’s speech ricocheted bafflingly from topic to topic. He told jokes in the worst possible taste and watched them arc through the Rose Garden sky before landing with a thud. And on a day intended for charity and good cheer, he described a state governor as “a big, fat slob”.</p>

      <p>Executive Martin Bally put on leave after alleged remarks were purportedly recorded and attributed to him in lawsuit</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/sep/11/campbells-to-drop-soup-from-company-name-after-102-years">Campbell’s Soup Company</a> executive has been put on temporary leave after he allegedly referred to the firm’s offerings as “shit for fucking poor people” – a remark purportedly caught on an audio recording and attributed to him in a former employee’s wrongful termination lawsuit.</p>
<p>The lawsuit was filed last Thursday in Wayne county circuit court in Michigan by Robert Garza, who had joined Campbell’s New Jersey headquarters remotely in September 2024 as a security analyst. Garza alleges he was fired in January after he raised concerns about comments made by Martin Bally, Campbell’s vice-president of information technology – including referring to one of the company’s ingredients as “bioengineered meat” while going off on a racist tirade.</p>

<p>Experts have told the Guardian the same anti-fascist groups the US state department recently named as foreign terrorist organizations and <a href="https://x.com/StateDept/status/1989034285819740531">accused</a> of “conspiring to undermine foundations of western civilization” barely qualify as groups, let alone terrorist organizations, and pose no active threat to Americans.</p>

<p>San Francisco receiver Jauan Jennings said he threw a punch at Tre’Von Moehrig at the end of Monday night’s game after a “cheap shot” from the Carolina safety.</p>
<p>Television cameras caught Moehrig <a href="https://x.com/Jordan_Woodson/status/1993169475777282291">delivering a punch to Jennings’ groin</a> late in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/nov/24/49ers-panthers-monday-night-football">49ers’ 20-9 victory</a>. Jennings did not immediately retaliate but once the game was over he approached Moehrig and hit him in the helmet before giving him a shove. Jennings then needed to be held back as the teams left the field.</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>A federal judge <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/24/james-comey-letitia-james-charges-case-dismissed">threw out the criminal cases against James Comey and Letitia James</a> yesterday, concluding that the prosecutor handling the cases was unlawfully appointed.</p>
<p><strong>What did the judge say?</strong> “I conclude that the attorney general’s attempt to install Ms Halligan as interim US attorney for the eastern district of Virginia was invalid and that Ms Halligan has been unlawfully serving in that role since 22 September 2025,” wrote Currie, who was appointed to the bench by Bill Clinton.</p>
<p><strong>When did the talks begin?</strong> Reports emerged that a fresh round of US-brokered peace talks had begun last night in the capital of the United Arab Emirates, with Dan Driscoll, the US army secretary, flying in to meet a Russian delegation and a Ukrainian team led by Kyrylo Budanov.</p>

      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> The world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, and its founder, Changpeng Zhao, are being sued by victims and family members of victims in the October 2023 attack in Israel. They're accusing Binance of knowingly enabling terrorist groups like Hamas to move more than $1 billion through its platform. Also: a slowdown at Serbia's Russian-owned oil refinery, growing risks to European undersea cables, and rerouted flights after an Ethiopian volcano eruption.</p>

<p>More than two decades ago, the US railed against the “axis of evil”. Now, after international climate talks spluttered to a meagre conclusion, the US finds itself grouped with unflattering company – an “axis of obstruction” that has stymied progress on the climate crisis.</p>
<p>Donald Trump’s administration opted to not send anyone to the UN climate summit in Brazil that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/nov/22/small-win-at-cop-on-finance-for-poor-countries-overshadowed-by-failure-on-fossil-fuels">culminated</a> over the weekend – a first for the US in 30 years of these annual gatherings and another representation of the president’s disdain for the climate crisis, which he has called a “hoax” and a “con job”.</p>

      <h1>The federal data and tools that "died" this year</h1>

(date: 2025-11-25)
      <p>
      <p>In the Trump administration's efforts to shrink and realign the federal government, datasets on climate, health and demographics <a href="https://fas.org/publication/deleted-federal-datasets/">have disappeared</a>. Some have been scrubbed from public view, others may not be collected anymore.</p>
<p>This data supported apps and interactive tools many researchers relied upon.</p>
<p>Marketplace’s Meghan McCarty Carino spoke with Denice Ross, senior advisor with the Federation of American Scientists and former chief data scientist for the U.S., who recently wrote a tribute to the data that's been lost.</p>

<p>Elina Svitolina simply could not go on. Her hopeful start to the 2025 season had given way to despair as the mental and emotional strain of constant competition, travelling and stress left its mark. The 31-year-old understood that competing would only make things worse and, in September, Svitolina decided to prematurely end her season, citing burnout.</p>
<p>The world No 14 is not alone in feeling suffocated by her sport. This has been another year filled with incredible performances and gripping matches, but the past 11 months have also been defined by the physical and mental ailments endured by many of the sport’s stars.</p>

<p>The president was online early today, and fired off a Truth Social post at 5:38am touting the economic impact that his sweeping tariffs will soon have on the country. He also noted that countries’ efforts to stockpile US goods ahead of the levies kicking in was “wearing thin”.</p>
<p>“These payments will be RECORD SETTING, and put our Nation on a new and unprecedented course,” he wrote. “This Tariff POWER will bring America National Security and Wealth the likes of which has never been seen before.”</p>
<p>Those opposing us are serving hostile foreign interests that are not aligned with the success, safety and prosperity of the USA. They couldn’t care less about us. I look so much forward to the United States Supreme Court’s decision on this urgent and time sensitive matter,” he added.</p>

      <p>The delayed-by-the-shutdown September jobs report showed a stronger-than-expected monthly gain of 119,000 jobs, seasonally adjusted. But dig into the data, and signs point to many of those jobs being second or third jobs. In this episode, more people are working multiple gigs to get by. Plus: China’s got a different AI investment approach than the U.S., the housing market got a boost in October, and your online return probably ended up on the secondary market.</p>

<p>The supreme court’s decision <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/12/north-dakota-abortion-ban-judge-strikes-down">reverses a lower-court ruling from last fall</a> that had frozen the ban, in part on the grounds that its exceptions were unconstitutionally vague. Although three of the court’s five justices agreed with the lower court, they fell short of the supermajority needed under state law to declare laws unconstitutional.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Investigation of Mark Kelly after Trump accused Democrats in video of ‘seditious behavior, punishable by death’</p>
<p>The Pentagon says it is investigating the Arizona senator Mark Kelly for possible breaches of military law after the federal lawmaker joined a handful of other <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats">Democrats</a> in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/20/democrats-condemn-trump-military-video-post">a video</a> calling for US troops to refuse unlawful orders.</p>
<p>It is extraordinary for the Pentagon to directly threaten a sitting member of Congress with investigation. Until <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s second presidency, the institution in charge of the US military had usually <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/17/trump-politicizing-military-report">strived to appear</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/22/trump-military-veterans">apolitical</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> announced it will cancel temporary asylum for about 10,000 Myanmar nationals living in the US, despite the country being ruled by a military dictatorship that has a record of executing dissidents.</p>
<p>On Monday the Department of Homeland Security said it was terminating the designation of Burma (Myanmar) for Temporary Protected Status relief. It claimed that after reviewing conditions in Myanmar and consulting with appropriate US government agencies, “the secretary [Kristi Noem] determined that Burma no longer continues to meet the conditions” for TPS designation.</p>

<p>Donald Trump on Sunday appeared to endorse the discredited conspiracy theory that Venezuela’s leadership controls electronic voting software worldwide and caused his 2020 election defeat to Joe Biden.</p>
<p>White House officials have previously said that Trump’s increasingly bellicose policy toward Venezuela is driven by concerns about migration and the drug trade. But the president’s new comment, made on <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115600167812342707">Truth Social</a>, hints that his hostility to Venezuela may also be based on an outlandish, implausible theory ruled to be false by a judge in 2023.</p>

<p>A photograph from a telegraphers union meeting. An Italian restaurant menu from Toronto. A newspaper clipping covering a graduating class of Royal Canadian Air Force engineers. What do all those have in common? That’s what researchers with the Alberta Family Histories Society are looking to uncover after receiving a mysterious box from a thrift store.</p>

      <h1>Can China spur consumer spending?</h1>

(date: 2025-11-24)
      <p>
      <p>The U.S. economy is often buoyed by consumer spending. In China, however, consumer spending is a much smaller part of economic output. And while the government there tries to stimulate spending, young people there are grappling with high unemployment and stalling wage growth. Plus, we'll discuss expectations for inflation and economic growth, as well as consumer shopping figures for this upcoming Black Friday.</p>

<p>Building on the momentum of consumer boycotts against Target and other companies earlier this year, grassroots organizers want American consumers to use their economic power this <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/thanksgiving">Thanksgiving</a> weekend to protest the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a>’s anti-immigration and anti-DEI crackdowns – and the big corporations that won’t oppose them.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://indivisible.org/campaign/we-aint-buying-it">We Ain’t Buying It</a> campaign – organized by many of the groups behind the No Kings protests – is asking Americans to stop shopping at Target, Home Depot and Amazon on Black Friday, one of the busiest retail days of the year, while also encouraging people to shop local and support community businesses.</p>

<p>So it turns out those who had already handed the title to Arsenal were right after all.</p>
<p>It’s absurd, of course, to start handing out the title in November but a feature of modern football is how obsessed it becomes so early with title races. It’s perhaps a legacy of the Pep Guardiola-Jürgen Klopp rivalry’s peak, when being champion meant amassing more than 95 points. It made sense then to scan the track far ahead for any potential hurdles because there were so few. But less than a third of the way through this season, Manchester City, who remain probably the biggest danger to Arsenal, have already dropped as many points as they did in the entirety of 2017-18, their 100-point campaign.</p>

<p>While reasoning varies, many of the newly approved petitioners said they were upset the UCP government used the Charter's notwithstanding clause last month to end a provincewide teachers strike. Another common reason given among applicants was that the MLAs being targeted aren't responsive to community concerns or aren't engaging with their constituents.</p>

      <p>He called one a ‘piggy’ after being questioned about the files, and reacted furiously to another during a meeting with the Saudi crown prince</p>
<p>Since the early days of his political career, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> has been critical of the media, but in recent days his hostility has reached a new peak – particularly when it comes to questions about his association with the pedophile <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a>.</p>
<p>Trump invoked the phrase “piggy” – a term he has used before – to describe a female reporter on Friday, and has aggressively responded to at least one other female reporter over the past week, including threatening to revoke ABC’s license.</p>

<p>US senators Josh Hawley and Richard Blumenthal have asked the heads of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to investigate revenue from ads on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/facebook">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/instagram">Instagram</a> that promote scams and banned goods.</p>
<p>“The FTC and SEC should immediately open investigations and, if the reporting is accurate, pursue vigorous enforcement action where appropriate” to force Meta to disgorge profits, pay penalties and agree to cease running such advertisements, Hawley and Blumenthal wrote in a letter to the federal agencies.</p>

(date: 2025-11-24)
      <p>
      <p>Americans don’t often have a direct say in how their tax dollars get spent; those decisions are generally left to elected officials. But some places have engaged in “participatory budgeting,” where residents propose projects, then vote on which ones get public funding. Today, we head to Nashville to learn how the process played out. But first: economics at the center of G20 discussions and what Thanksgiving travel plans are looking like.</p>

(date: 2025-11-24)
      <p>
      <p>Disqualifications of Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri bring unnecessary stress for McLaren in the final two F1 races of the season</p>
<p>As misjudgments go, McLaren’s error in calculations that led <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/nov/23/max-verstappen-wins-f1-las-vegas-gp-lando-norris-second">to the disqualification of Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri</a> from the Las Vegas Grand Prix on Sunday could barely have been more cataclysmic nor more poorly timed. Quite how they got it wrong just when they wanted to close out the drivers’ championship with as little fuss as possible will take no little explanation.</p>
<p>Norris and Piastri, second and fourth respectively to Max Verstappen’s win in Nevada, had been solid enough results until the FIA discovered the skid blocks on their cars had been worn beyond the 9mm limit. In one fell swoop, Verstappen was right back in the fight, alongside Piastri, 24 points back from Norris.</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>Senator Mark Kelly yesterday urged congressional Republicans to publicly reject Trump’s threats against him and five other Democratic lawmakers who have said that military personnel are not obliged to follow illegal commands.</p>
<p><strong>What did Kelly say?</strong> “His words carry tremendous weight, more so than anybody else in the country, and he should be aware of that, and because of what he says, there is now increased threats against us,” Kelly said of Trump’s accusations.</p>
<p><strong>What does the original plan say?</strong> The original <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/20/us-russia-reportedly-draft-plan-end-ukraine-war-zelenskyy">28-point US document</a> leaked last week demanded that Ukraine should hand over territory to Russia, limit the size of its army and agree not to pursue the Kremlin for alleged war crimes.</p>

      <p>Exodus of lawyers under Trump weakens department’s capacity in civil rights, national security and other areas</p>
<p>Donald Trump’s weaponization of the US department of justice to focus on retribution against political foes, on fulfilling Maga goals and on granting pardons for allies has seen thousands of lawyers depart or be fired and weakened investigations in civil rights, national security and other areas, say ex-prosecutors and legal experts.</p>
<p>Data compiled by the nonpartisan Justice Connection showed that overall DoJ employment has dropped by about 5,500 lawyers and non-lawyers who have left since Trump took office. That included people who were fired, quit or took a deferred resignation program, underscoring a sharp drop in DoJ resources. By contrast, the department last year employed about 10,000 attorneys, according to DoJ data.</p>

      <p>Physicians say FDA panel conflated two issues and made baseless claims about unproven health benefits</p>
<p>Estrogen-related medications for menopause will no longer carry broad black-box warnings, Marty Makary, commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), announced last week, bypassing the regulatory agency’s typical process and, according to experts, overstating the science behind the medications – with troubling implications for future drug decisions.</p>
<p>The decision to remove an ominous warning from 2003 about the risks of cardiovascular disease, breast cancer and dementia makes sense for local vaginal estrogen products, but systemic estrogen is more complicated, menopause experts said – and more than these nuances, they worried about the scientific process, or lack thereof, in making the decision.</p>

      <p>Expecting to be financial advisers at the Fortune 500 firm, some hires say they were ‘gaslit’ into peddling ‘terrible’ life insurance to all their contacts</p>
<p>Northwestern Mutual likes to think of itself as a storied American institution offering specialized financial advice. The 168-year-old financial giant, ranked 109 on the Fortune 500, and regularly anointed one of the World’s Most Admired Companies by the magazine, <a href="https://www.northwesternmutual.com/who-we-are/">describes</a> its financial advisers as “expert listeners” or a “trusted partner who helps you continue to reach goal after goal”.</p>
<p>It also tops Forbes’s list of Best Employers for New Grads, a title that makes it attractive to hundreds of college students desperate for an internship that could launch them into a career in financial services. Each year they file into Northwestern’s glassy offices across the country for a three-month internship that they hope could change their lives. There, they are slotted in beside thousands of full-time “financial representatives”, many of them recent graduates themselves.</p>

Amid widening concerns about the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/nov/23/affordability-crisis-inflation-costs">rising cost of living</a>, polls <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/16/inflation-economic-pessimism-poll">show</a> consumers are increasingly worried about inflation.</p>
<p>Economists say the picture for holiday food prices this year is more mixed – prices are volatile and depend largely on how families shop around for their feast.</p>

      <h1>AI-generated "letters to the editor" are flooding academic publications</h1>

(date: 2025-11-24)
      <p>
      <p>Dr. Carlos Chaccour, physician scientist at the University of Navarra, noticed something fishy about a letter to the editor the New England Journal of Medicine received shortly after it published a paper of his on malaria treatment in July.</p>
<p>The letter was riddled with strange errors such as critiques supposedly based on other research Chaccour himself had written. So he and his co-author Matthew Rudd decided to dig deeper.</p>
<p>They analyzed patterns of letters to the editor over the last decade and found a remarkable increase in what they call &quot;prolific debutantes&quot; — new authors who suddenly had dozens, even hundreds of letters published, starting right around the time OpenAI’s ChatGPT came out.</p>
<p>Why would academics want to do this? Marketplace’s Meghan McCarty Carino spoke with Chaccour to find out.</p>

      <p>The most successful quarterback of all-time approached his playing career with ruthless focus. He could do with the same intensity in his retirement projects</p>
<p>Tom Brady played for 23 NFL seasons with a single, maniacal goal: to become the greatest quarterback who ever lived. He achieved it. Now, in retirement, Brady has dabbled in everything. He <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/18/tom-bradys-raiders-coaching-booth-fox">calls games for Fox</a>. He’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/nov/20/birmingham-city-unveil-62000-capacity-stadium-plans-12-chimney-towers">building chimneys in Birmingham</a>. He’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/mar/27/where-did-ftx-money-go">flogged crypto</a>. He’s spreading <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/15/nfl-tom-brady-flag-football-saudi-arabia-olympics">America’s Game to Riyadh</a>. He has a thriving YouTube account. He <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/nov/04/tom-brady-dog-clone-colossal-biotech-viagen">cloned his dog</a>. Brady’s post-playing portfolio has been diverse, or aimless, depending on your perspective.</p>
<p>Side hustles are one thing. But running a pro franchise is not a part-time job. Along with his other roles, Brady is also the de facto football czar of the Raiders, the most hapless team in the league.</p>

<p>At a press conference last week U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi laid out fresh allegations against Ryan Wedding, a 44-year-old Canadian and former Olympian who has been on the FBI’s most wanted list since March.
Wedding is already accused of orchestrating multiple murders, and these new charges add to the drug and conspiracy allegations he’s facing.
We speak to Calvi Leon, a reporter at the Toronto Star who’s been covering this case extensively.

<p>Senator Mark Kelly on Sunday urged congressional <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans">Republicans</a> to publicly reject Trump’s threats against him and five other <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats">Democratic</a> lawmakers who stated that military personnel are not obligated to follow illegal commands.</p>
<p>“We’ve heard very little, basically crickets, from Republicans in the United States Congress about what the president has said about hanging members of Congress,” Kelly, of Arizona, said on CBS’s <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/face-the-nation-full-transcript-11-23-2025/">Face the Nation</a>.</p>

      <p>New York mayor-elect reaffirms past criticisms of president after agreeing to work with him on cost-of-living concerns</p>
<p>Zohran Mamdani has reiterated his view that Donald Trump is a “fascist” and a “despot” just days after the pair had a surprisingly cordial meeting at the White House.</p>
<p>Speaking to NBC’s Meet the Press on Sunday, the New York City mayor-elect was asked if he still considered Trump a threat to democracy. “Everything that I’ve said in the past I continue to believe,” Mamdani replied. “I think it is important in our politics that we don’t shy away from where we have disagreements.”</p>

<p>The “department of government efficiency” (Doge) has apparently been dissolved with eight months still remaining on its contract, ending a drawn-out campaign of invading federal agencies and firing thousands of federal workers.</p>
<p>“That doesn’t exist,” office of personnel management (OPM) director Scott Kupor told Reuters earlier this month when asked about Doge’s status, adding that it was no longer a “centralized entity”.</p>

      <h1>They’re doing to America what they did to Christianity | Bill McKibben</h1>

(date: 2025-11-23)
      <p>
      <p>Trump’s wrecking-ball approach to America has a precedent: the Maga evangelical perversion of Jesus’s message of radical love to one of hate and aggression</p>
<p>Trumpism’s most revealing and defining moments – not its most important, nor cruelest, nor most dangerous, nor stupidest, but perhaps its most illuminating – came earlier this autumn. In the course of a few weeks, the US president started showing everyone his plans for a gilded ballroom twice the size of the White House and then began unilaterally ripping down the East Wing to build it. Then, after nationwide protests against his rule, he posted on social media an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/20/trump-ai-video-no-kings">AI video</a> of himself wearing a crown and piloting a fighter jet labeled “King Trump”, which proceeded to bomb American cities and Americans with a graphically vivid load of human poop.</p>
<p>He has done things 10,000 times as bad – the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-documentary/the-shutdown-of-usaid-has-already-killed-hundreds-of-thousands">current estimate</a> of deaths from his cuts to USAID is 600,000 and rising, and this week a <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-climate-rollbacks-heat-deaths">study</a> predicted his fossil fuel policies would kill another 1.3 million. But nothing as definitional. No other president would have dared – really, no other president would have imagined – unilaterally destroying large sections of the White House in order to erect a Versailles-style party room, with the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/23/trump-white-house-ballroom-donors">active collaboration</a> of some of the richest Americans, almost all of whom have business with the government. And no one – not Richard Nixon, not Andrew Jackson, not Warren Harding, not anyone – would have imagined boasting about defecating on the American citizenry. Even the worst American leaders were willing to maintain the notion that they represented all the people; Trump has managed to turn America’s idea of itself entirely upside down. And he has done it with the active consent of an entire political party. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, when asked about the poop video, for once did not bother lying that he had not seen it. Instead he said: “The president uses social media to make the point. You can argue he’s probably the most effective person who’s ever used social media.”</p>

He and his cousins would often hunt for pheasants and grouse, or harvest wild berries and Thíŋpsiŋla, a wild prairie turnip that’s a staple Lakota food. Sherman’s earliest memories of food were full of history, culture and spiritualism.</p>
<p>His idealistic experiences of harvesting and hunting for food on the reservation were juxtaposed with the legacy of colonialism. Most of the time, Sherman and his family ate government-issued food such as canned beef, or blocks of cow cheese, which diverged from their traditional diet. It’s a tale that Sherman, co-founder of the Minneapolis-based Indigenous restaurant <a href="https://owamni.com/">Owamni</a>, shares along with other stories in a new cookbook that highlights Indigenous cuisines throughout North America.</p>

      <p>
      <p>The costs of groceries, housing, childcare, education and healthcare have become intolerable to many</p>
<p>Frozen dinners were useful when no one was home to cook. A fancy cheese or apple roll felt like a family treat. But not any more. “We can’t afford to do those little luxuries any more because they’re just too expensive to feed five with,” says Cat Hill. “There’s not any wiggle room.”</p>
<p>The 43-year-old from Hornby, New York, has been hit by both higher grocery prices and rising costs for her small business running a horse stable. Under <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>, she worries it may get even harder. “With this administration, it doesn’t appear to be stabilising,” she adds. “It’s hard to think about how exactly we are going to ride this out.”</p>

<p>One morning in October, Donna DesRuisseaux headed to a local bridge near her home in Goffstown, New Hampshire, armed with a sign that said: “Honk for democracy.” The 62-year-old business manager was taking part in a new tradition of protesting on various bridges and overpasses throughout the state.</p>
<p>“I’m very worried about our democracy, freedom of speech, social security and health insurance,” said DesRuisseaux, who attended a No Kings protest in Manchester, New Hampshire, later that day, where she ran into some of her “bridge friends”. DesRuisseaux had never protested anything prior to 2025, in part because she was a busy working mom. But after discovering the <a href="https://www.nhbbd.org">NH Bridge Brigade for Democracy</a> group on Facebook, she knew she had to do something to express her outrage.</p>

      <h1>China has brought millions out of poverty. The US has not – by choice</h1>

(date: 2025-11-23)
      <p>
      <p>Despite the US’s economic success, income inequality remains breathtaking. But this is no glitch – it’s the system</p>
<p>The Chinese did rather well in the age of globalization. In 1990, 943 million people there lived on less than <span class="math inline">\(3 a day measured in 2021 dollars – 83% of the population, according to the World Bank. By 2019, the [number was brought down to zero](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.DDAY?locations=CN). Unfortunately, the United States was [not as successful](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.DDAY?locations=US). More than 4 million Americans – 1.25% of the population – must make ends meet with less than \)</span>3 a day, more than three times as many as 35 years ago.</p>
<p>The data is not super consistent with the narrative of the US’s inexorable success. Sure, American productivity has zoomed ahead of that of its European peers. Only a handful of countries manage to produce more stuff per hour of work. And artificial intelligence now promises to put the United States that much further ahead.</p>

<p>He says he doesn’t watch every Bulls game these days – only about half of them. That he hasn’t spoken to Giddey much since his move to Illinois. That Longley’s life in Australia, where he part-owns the Sydney Kings and Flames, takes up most of his energies rather than what is happening on the shores of Lake Michigan.</p>

      <p>Anna Kepner, 18, from Titusville, was found dead of asphyxiation under a bed on a Carnival cruise ship</p>
<p>The 16-year-old stepbrother of a Florida teenager found dead aboard a Carnival cruise ship this month has been identified as a suspect in her death.</p>
<p>Anna Kepner, an 18-year-old from Titusville, was found dead under a bed on the Carnival Horizon on 8 November, wrapped in a blanket and covered by life vests, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/teen-found-dead-carnival-cruise-died-asphyxiation/story?id=127759360">ABC News</a> reported. Preliminary findings indicate she died of asphyxiation from a bar hold – an arm across the neck – with investigators noting two bruises on the side of her neck. A final autopsy and toxicology report are still pending.</p>

      <h1>‘This is not right’: grassroots campaign aims to repeal Missouri Republicans’ gerrymandering</h1>

(date: 2025-11-22)
      <p>
      <p>A new congressional map was abruptly passed by Republicans in mid-September – but voters have a chance to rebuke politicians and stop it from going into effect</p>
<p>When canvassers fan out across neighborhoods, they usually rely on sophisticated lists that will tell them things like a voter’s political party and how likely they are to support a given cause. Jill Imbler isn’t bothering with any of that.</p>
<p>The 69-year-old has lived in Moberly – a Missouri town of about 14,000 people – her entire life. She doesn’t use a GPS when she drives around, knows where people live, and what time they’re likely to be home. And there’s a pretty good chance that she,or one of her six siblings, knows them personally.</p>

(date: 2025-11-22)
      <p>
      <p>Years of hollowed out shops, safety worries and stalled leadership have left the famed coastal city searching for a way back</p>
<p>Santa Monica is a city that would seem to have everything. A glorious, wide sandy beach. A fabled pier framed by palm trees and views of the southern California mountains. An aura of Hollywood magic, with a native honor roll that runs from Shirley Temple to Sean Penn. Streets that smell like the Mediterranean, filled with restaurants, cafes and interesting one-off shops.</p>
<p>And yet, for the past several years, almost nothing has gone right for a beach resort known and envied in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/los-angeles">Los Angeles</a> area for its beauty, its excellent public schools, and a progressive political culture that has sought to keep the city accessible and affordable to people of all income levels.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Ban forbids all products that contain more than 0.4 milligrams of THC per package – a trace amount present in most CBD products</p>
<p>The US hemp industry is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/12/hemp-republican-spending-bill">preparing for a ban</a> on most hemp products that Senator Mitch McConnell slipped into the spending bill just before the Senate voted to pass it and end the government shutdown.</p>
<p>Many in the industry have criticized the last-minute change, arguing that it should have been subject to open hearings rather than added at the last minute to a bill whose passage was essential for the government reopening. The ban, which goes into effect 12 months after the law’s passage, forbids all products that contain more than 0.4 milligrams of THC per package – a trace amount that is present in most CBD products, not just those whose primary component is THC.</p>

      <p>For many people gathering around the table this holiday season, things feel a little different. Maybe it’s the cost of ingredients that’s on your mind, or cuts to USDA funding that have left your food bank running low. Or maybe it’s the simple reality of a packed schedule — there’s a lot to cook, and so little time.</p>
<p>In this special from Marketplace, we bring listeners a collection of stories on the business and economics of food. Our reporters take us across the country to farms, home kitchens, and restaurants. We visit a refugee farmer in Houston, a chocolate-making lab in California, and stop for a bite at an award-winning restaurant in Portland.</p>

      <p>A year and a half after his unstoppable rise was hijacked, the 26-year-old boxing star aims to become a three-weight champion against big-punching Brian Norman Jr</p>
<p>Rain falls in thin, needling lines over Hell’s Kitchen as Devin Haney walks into the Victory Boxing Gym. Somewhere along Ninth Avenue an ambulance threads through the congestion, its siren drawn out into a long, mournful ribbon that slips past the gym’s walls. He nods to a few familiar faces, peels off a Supreme Vanson leather jacket and begins to unwrap himself from the city. His father, Bill, arrives a step behind him, not so much entering the room as taking possession of it.</p>
<p>“The youngest undisputed champion!” Bill cries out, half to the gym, half to himself. “He’s done it on three continents! Twenty-six years old and still writing history! Let the sparks fly!”</p>

<p>The prominent linguist and philosopher <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/noam-chomsky">Noam Chomsky</a> called it a “most valuable experience” to have maintained “regular contact” with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a>, who by then had long been convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor, according to emails released earlier in November this month by US lawmakers.</p>
<p>Such comments from Chomsky, or attributed to him, suggest his association with Epstein – who officials concluded killed himself in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges – went deeper than the occasional political and academic discussions the former <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/17/jeffrey-epstein-noam-chomsky-bard-college-president">had previously claimed</a> to have with the latter.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Experts infuriated by president accusing Democrats of ‘sedition’ for urging soldiers to refuse illegal orders</p>
<p>Veterans have condemned the politicization of the military after Donald Trump <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/20/democrats-condemn-trump-military-video-post">accused Democratic</a> lawmakers of “sedition, punishable by death” after a small group of them released a video in which they urged US soldiers not to follow any “unlawful” orders.</p>
<p>The extraordinary exchange was sparked after Democratic lawmakers with military or national security backgrounds – the Congressional representatives Maggie Goodlander, Jason Crow, Chris DeLuzio and Chrissy Houlahan, and the senators Mark Kelly and Elissa Slotkin – posted a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2558895077819811">video</a> on Facebook addressed to US service members.</p>

      <p>A pension-pot World Cup looms and with Trump in the White House and a crown prince at his back, it is now a safe space</p>
<p>It was hard to choose one favourite photo from football’s double-header at the White House this week. In part this is because the pictures from Donald Trump’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/18/trump-bin-salman-visit-jamal-khashoggi">state dinner with Mohammed bin Salman</a> and his in-house hype men Cristiano Ronaldo and Gianni Infantino were everywhere, recycled feverishly across the internet, dusted with their own drool-stained commentary by the wider Ronaldo-verse.</p>
<p>Mainly there were just so many jaw-droppers. Perhaps you liked the one of Trump and Ronaldo strolling the halls of power, Ronaldo dressed all in black and laughing uproariously, like a really happy ninja. Or the one of Ronaldo and Georgina Rodríguez standing either side of a weirdly beaming Trump at his desk, holding up some kind of large heraldic key as though they’ve just been presented with their own wind-up wooden sex-grandad.</p>

<p>Norris beat the Red Bull of Max Verstappen into second and, with his closest title rival and teammate Oscar Piastri in fifth, he can further extend his advantage at the top of the standings on Sunday. Indeed, he had been so cool in advance that he took in spot of shut-eye before it began and then weathered the hazardous conditions with insouciance.</p>

      <p>
      <p>TJX, the parent company of off-price retailers T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, and HomeGoods, posted excellent earnings this week, while Target cut its sales forecast. “Off-price” means TJX sells excess inventory at a discount, which may be more attractive to increasingly stressed shoppers hunting for deals. Also in this episode: Political affiliation colors consumer sentiment, USDA cuts end a major revenue stream for small-scale farmers, and supply chains are unusually slow this holiday season.</p>

      <h1>‘I’ll stick up for you’: key moments from the cordial Trump-Mamdani meeting</h1>

(date: 2025-11-21)
      <p>
      <p>The president hosted the mayor-elect at the White House – and seemed enamoured of his fellow New Yorker</p>
<p>The highly anticipated Oval Office meeting between <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/zohran-mamdani">Zohran Mamdani</a> – the mayor-elect of New York City, the US president’s beloved home town – was hardly the combustible tête-à-tête many had predicted. For the moment at least, the two New Yorkers appeared friendly, smiling and cautiously optimistic about the work they might accomplish together.</p>
<p>Neither revived their hot campaign trail rhetoric, in which they cast each other as diametrically opposed political adversaries. Trump had labeled Mamdani a “ <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114745583467776157">100% Communist Lunatic</a>” and urged voters to back his opponent, the former New York governor Andrew Cuomo.

<p>In a call to 911, the unidentified driver on US Route 74 in Swain county, near Bryson City, told a dispatcher that a bald eagle dropped the cat. Bryson City is about 65 miles south-west of Asheville.</p>

      <h1>New Mexico now offers free childcare for all. Here’s how parents and teachers made it happen</h1>

(date: 2025-11-21)
      <p>
      <p>From marches and petitions to a constitutional amendment, a years-long campaign led to New Mexico becoming the first state in the US to offer universal childcare</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/21/people-in-the-us-have-you-gotten-involved-in-community-organizing-this-year">People in the US: Have you gotten involved in activism or community organizing this year?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>One crisp morning in 2018, Sandra Ibarra pulled on a pair of gloves to ward off the winter chill and picked up the first cardboard sign she had designed for a protest.</p>
<p>As a recent immigrant to the United States, Ibarra was wary of attending a demonstration. But since arriving in the United States from Mexico she had had to change careers – it was difficult to recertify her licensing as an accountant in a new country and easier to begin working in childcare – and was shocked by the poor pay. Although she taught, cooked, cleaned and did the books for a small childcare center, she was earning minimum wage. A classmate at the local community college had suggested Ibarra attend the rally, and stick around afterward for a meal with Olé, a grassroots non-profit committed to organizing working-class families.</p>

      <h1>The Disneyfication of F1: Goofy in the pitlane and Fantasia in Vegas underline sport’s US transformation</h1>

(date: 2025-11-21)
      <p>
      <p>As little as a decade ago it would have been unthinkable that an American institution such as Disney would have chosen to hitch its wagon to F1</p>
<p>The remarkable nature of the transformation in Formula One’s fortunes in the United States could not have been better illustrated than by the incongruous sight of Mickey Mouse and an assortment of his Disney pals leading a gang of enthusiastic fans on a walk down the pit lane at the Las Vegas Grand Prix.</p>
<p>F1 successfully hosting a race in Sin City and the US now boasting three sellout meetings is testament to the sport’s burgeoning prosperity. For all of the somewhat surreal edge of seeing Donald Duck and Goofy outside garages, the fact Disney has chosen F1 as a partner is indicative of the sea change the sport has brought about in a market it has long coveted.</p>

(date: 2025-11-21)
      <p>
      <p>The Trump administration has unveiled plans for a huge expansion of offshore oil drilling. Federal law requires the Interior Department to come up with five-year schedules of oil and gas lease sales. The most recent proposal includes as many as 34 potential offshore lease sales, near the coasts of Alaska, California, and Florida. Also on the show: why the Dutch government wanted to take over a Chinese-owned chip company.</p>

<p>Taylor, who has been detained for almost a year, told the Guardian he has now been diagnosed with bone spurs in his back, causing severe pain, while the silicone lining of one of his prosthetic legs has deteriorated, causing chafing and boils.</p>

      <p>Experts say files certain to contain revelations but warn disclosures could still leave critical questions unanswered</p>
<p>They are the files that America – and the world – has long waited to see: a huge cache of documents at the Department of Justice related to the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/judge-calls-jeffrey-epstein-most-infamous-pedophile-in-american-history-as-he-releases-transcripts/">whom a judge</a> once dubbed the “most infamous pedophile in American history”.</p>
<p>After a law passed by Congress and signed by Trump on Wednesday, those documents must now must be released to the American public and a waiting army of journalists. Just like previous Epstein caches they are certain to include damning communications between Epstein and many rich and powerful people in his social circle.</p>

<p>The Department of Justice has alleged that two <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/texas">Texas</a> men plotted a murderous coup d’etat on the island of Gonâve, the largest in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/haiti">Haiti</a>, “for the purpose of carrying out their rape fantasies”.</p>
<p>The two men, 21-year-old Gavin Rivers Weisenburg and 20-year-old Tanner Christopher Thomas, have been accused of plotting to take the island by force, utilizing the homeless population of Washington DC, then killing all the men on the island and “using the women and children as sex slaves”, according to an announcement by the US attorney’s office of the eastern district of Texas on Thursday.</p>

<p>A gold Rolex desk clock and a $130,000 engraved gold bar given to Donald Trump by a group of Swiss billionaires have raised questions in Europe and the US about the personalisation of US presidential power.</p>
<p>Pasquale Tridico, an Italian MEP and the former head of the country’s national institute for social security said he was “disgusted” by the golden charm offensive, made weeks before Trump <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/14/tariffs-swiss-goods-reduced">decided to slash 39% tariffs on Swiss imports</a> to 15%.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Plus Vanity Fair’s plucky decision to feature only men in its Hollywood Issue and the reporter fired after RFK Jr ‘sexting scandal’</p>
<p>We’ve all said things that didn’t come out right, and it’s my instinct – stand by for some counter-intuition! – that Donald Trump’s “quiet, piggy” admonishment of a female reporter on Air Force One this week was a very weird attempt at affection, or possibly flirtation. As with everything the man does, the effect was disastrous and totally inappropriate. But rewatching the video, I saw from the president less an example of his usual bigotry and more an attempt at what looked like “OK, kiddo” cuteness that, catastrophically, and before I could nip it in the bud, had triggered a tiny sprig of sympathy.</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>Democrats <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/20/democrats-condemn-trump-military-video-post">expressed outrage</a> after Donald Trump accused a group of Democratic lawmakers of engaging in “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH” and that they should be arrested after they posted a video in which they told active service members they should refuse illegal orders.</p>
<p><strong>What did the lawmakers say in the video?</strong> “Our laws are clear: you can refuse illegal orders, you must refuse illegal orders. No one has to carry out orders that violate the law or our constitution.”</p>
<p><strong>What did the report say?</strong> A “joint situational information report” from the FBI and the New York police department (NYPD), dated 28 August 2025, quoted from a chat on Signal, the encrypted messaging app, and also characterized the court watchers as “anarchist violent extremist actors”.</p>
<p><strong>Where did it come from?</strong> The two-page report was distributed to other law enforcement agencies across the US. The records were obtained by <a href="https://propertyofthepeople.org/">Property of the People</a>, a government transparency non-profit, through public records requests.</p>

      <p>After months of ICE raids on the nation’s capital, some construction workers are afraid to go into Washington, D.C. for work, fearing arrest and deportation. Meanwhile, the contractors who need them are struggling to adapt. We'll check in on some of the businesses that are being most affected. But first: why markets ended yesterday on a sour note, and why the housing affordability crisis is accelerating fastest in rural areas.</p>

It's the first major policy initiative of the new prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, and aims to help households and companies with measures like energy subsidies and tax cuts. Then, the global climate change conference COP30 is drawing to a close in Brazil, and so far, there’s been no agreement on key issues like the fossil fuel phaseout.</p>

      <p>‘Morale is completely lost,’ say workers as Trump administration strips some programs and transfers others</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s bid to gut the US Department of Education “makes no sense”, according to workers inside the federal agency, who accuse the administration of trying to make their lives “as difficult and traumatic as possible”.</p>
<p>Three employees inside the department spoke to the Guardian, with one warning that morale has been “completely lost”, 10 months after Trump returned to the White House. All requested to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Shawny Williams, who tried to reform Vallejo police department, says threats to his safety led him to resign</p>
<p>The embattled former police chief of Vallejo, a San Francisco Bay Area city that has attracted <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/11/23/how-a-deadly-police-force-ruled-a-city">national attention</a> over police violence, has said that he endured a steady procession of racist remarks from colleagues and online harassment and threats that ultimately led him to resign.</p>
<p>By the time Chief Shawny Williams tendered his resignation in 2022, he said he had received a slew of threats – at his office, at his home, and in his email inbox. Most demanded he step down. But even after resigning, the threats still came by mail to his home and a second property he owned outside the state.</p>

      <p>The holiday shopping season is here, and AI companies are pushing new chatbot retail partnerships. But, can these tools deliver on their promises to make shopping easier? Plus, the return of Vine, the beloved video app known for its ultra-short absurdist memes.</p>
<p>But first, Meta is not a monopoly, according to a federal judge’s ruling this week in the longstanding antitrust case against the social media giant, which claimed Meta had stifled competition by buying Instagram and WhatsApp.</p>
<p>Marketplace’s Meghan McCarty Carino spoke with Paresh Dave, senior writer at Wired, to discuss all of the above on this week’s “Marketplace Tech Bytes: Week in Review.”</p>

<p>Boosted by cultural phenomena like the hit series Yellowstone and Beyonce’s Cowboy Carter album and tour, rodeo and all things Western are enjoying a cultural resurgence. Attendance, broadcast and streaming viewership are at all time highs. So is the prize money, which is attracting more and more young athletes seeking a chance to make a name for themselves.</p>
<p>But while rodeo is booming, athlete development remains antiquated.</p>

<p>Allen took consecutive sacks on the Bills’ final possession, leading to a fourth-and-27, but Buffalo (7-4) gained 44 yards on a short pass from Allen to Josh Palmer, who tossed a lateral to Khalil Shakir. After a false-start penalty created a fourth-and-6 for Buffalo (7-4), Calen Bullock picked off Allen’s pass at the Houston 9 with 24 seconds left.</p>

      <p>Big-name drivers and cutting out the middle man a vital part of the strategy with just over 100 days to go before the 2026 season opener</p>
<p>Twelve months ago at the Las Vegas Grand Prix, Cadillac were finally given the green light as Formula One’s newest entry for 2026. Building the team from scratch has entailed a frenetic work rate that the team principal, Graeme Lowdon, has compared to the Apollo moon landing. As F1 descends on Vegas this weekend, Cadillac know time is getting tight.</p>
<p>At the final race of the season to be staged in the United Statess, with just over 100 days to go before they take to the track for the first time in Melbourne at the 2026 opener, Cadillac have come on in leaps and bounds but, in what must seem like a sisyphean task, they are aware there will never be enough hours in the day.</p>

</ul>
<p>Gracie Hunt, the daughter of Kansas City Chiefs owner Clark Hunt, is throwing her support behind Turning Point USA’s plan to stage an alternative Super Bowl half-time show, a direct counter to the NFL’s decision <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/sep/29/bad-bunny-to-headline-2026-super-bowl-halftime-show">to feature Bad Bunny at Super Bowl LX</a>.</p>
<p>Hunt said in an appearance on Fox News Channel’s The Will Cain Show on Tuesday that she “most definitely” backs Turning Point’s counter-programming effort, spearheaded by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/18/charlie-erika-kirk-turning-point-usa-tpusa">Erika Kirk</a>, the widow of Charlie Kirk. The NFL’s choice of Bad Bunny for the half-time show has attracted strong pushback from many on the right, who object to his <a href="https://time.com/5852446/bad-bunny-black-lives-matter/">criticism of Donald Trump</a> and US immigration enforcement.</p>

      <h1>Finally, clues about the job market</h1>

(date: 2025-11-20)
      <p>
      <p>After a month and a half delay due to the government shutdown, we are finally getting some official economic data. It is old (from September), but it's here. The economy gained 119,000 jobs, and the unemployment rate went up for the third month in a row. What's that mean for job seekers? Plus, declining consumer sentiment doesn't translate to declining consumer spending, Walmart's quarterly results beat expectations, and international student enrollment has dipped.</p>

      <p>As federal agents descend in North Carolina, businesses close as even an after-school program is targeted</p>
<p>On Central Avenue in Charlotte, North Carolina, Manolo’s Bakery has become a focal point for resistance to the expanded immigration raids since border patrol officers descended on the city over the weekend. The owner closed the bakery to prevent his staff from being targeted. Most of the other shops on Charlotte’s busy immigrant-centric street followed suit.</p>
<p>Dozens of people have taken up camp in the parking lot to wave signs of support for immigrants. Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ice-us-immigration-and-customs-enforcement">ICE</a>) has been active in the city for months as part of Donald Trump’s mass <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usimmigration">deportation agenda</a>, but things went up a level when the border patrol arrived. Agents swiftly began buzzing through the place to make an armed show of their presence, followed at times by Charlotteans honking their horns in warning.</p>

      <h1>AI to the rescue (for now)</h1>

(date: 2025-11-20)
      <p>
      <p>Nvidia reported earnings yesterday after markets closed, and it did not disappoint. Nvidia makes 90% of all chips used in AI. Tech stocks, including Nvidia, have been carrying a lot of weight in markets, and investors had started getting a little nervous about whether the AI boom was a bubble — but Nvidia's results have been pretty reassuring. Also: stale data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and Japan's tensions with China.</p>

      <h1>First Thing: US and Russian officials draft plan to end Ukraine war based on capitulation from Kyiv</h1>

(date: 2025-11-20)
      <p>
      <p>The plan, which is likely to be viewed as ‘surrender’ by Kyiv, is facing pushback from the EU. Plus, Trump signs bill to compel release of more Epstein documents</p>

</ul>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>US and Russian officials have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/19/us-and-russian-officials-draft-new-peace-plan-based-on-capitulation-from-ukraine">quietly drafted a new plan to end the war in Ukraine</a> that would require Kyiv to cede territory and severely cut the size of its military, it was reported on Wednesday, in a development that Kyiv will probably view as surrender.</p>
<p><strong>Is this plan formally backed by the Trump administration?</strong> That’s still unclear, as Witkoff and Dmitriev have created an informal backchannel.</p>
<p><strong>What has the EU said?</strong> Any peace plan needs Kyiv and Europe “on board”. Foreign ministers are meeting today to discuss this – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/nov/20/ukraine-russia-peace-plan-european-union-donald-trump-vladimir-putin-kaja-kallas-europe-live-news-updates?page=with%3Ablock-691ed2af8f084e05b1cbbf15#block-691ed2af8f084e05b1cbbf15">follow our live blog here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What will the justice department actually release?</strong> All files related to Epstein – including the investigation into his death by suicide in prison. While they can redact identifying information about victims, it specifically bars officials from declining to disclose information over concerns about “embarrassment, reputational harm or political sensitivity”.</p>

<p>Sergio Busquets didn’t expect to last this long. More than a decade ago, he predicted he’d retire by his early 30s. But when he finally announced in September that he’ll hang up his boots at the end of Inter Miami’s season, he did so as a 37-year-old defensive midfielder who still somehow never leaves the pitch for one of the best teams in MLS.</p>
<p>He could be playing his final game this weekend, if Miami lose their conference semi-final against FC Cincinnati on Sunday.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Tucker Carlson’s interview with the activist revealed the mainstream right is being flooded by extremism – and it’s now impossible to contain</p>
<p>Five days a week, thousands of fans gather online to watch Nick Fuentes hold court about the dangers of non-white immigration, feminism and “organized Jewry”. Usually dressed in a dark suit and tie, he lectures to his far-right followers, known as “Groypers”, about what he argues is the insufficient radicalism of Donald Trump’s Republican party and what he describes as the perfidies of the state of Israel and its American supporters.</p>
<p>Fuentes’s fixation with Israel is not rooted in concern about the war in Gaza but a belief, in his telling, that Jews are responsible for most of society’s problems. Fuentes, who is 27 and lives in Illinois, has called Adolf Hitler “really fucking cool” and compared the Holocaust to the baking of cookies.</p>

      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Wall Street was cheered last night by better-than-expected results from the chip giant Nvidia. But the AI boom continues to fuel fears of a market bubble. In the past few weeks, a growing number of the world’s leading figures in finance have suggested that AI stocks are unrealistically inflated in value. Plus, Meta says it's shutting down accounts for younger teenagers in Australia ahead of the country's social media ban for youths under 16.</p>

<p>Healthcare providers across the country have closed clinics and hospital wards in the four months since <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> signed into law the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the landmark tax-and-spending legislation that will lead an estimated <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61367">10 million people to lose their health insurance</a>.</p>
<p>The law is expected to slash federal funding by hundreds of billions of dollars over the coming years, as part of Trump’s campaign pledge to shrink government spending. Though the bill isn’t thought to be the only cause of the closures – it may have an impact on local healthcare settings that are financially struggling.</p>

<p>The discussions, according to people familiar with the matter, come as Paramount portrays itself as the best bid for Warner Bros Discovery, after the company announced last month it was open to offers, because it would have an easier time getting through regulatory review.</p>

      <h1>The difference between Grokipedia and Wikipedia</h1>

(date: 2025-11-20)
      <p>
      <p>Grokipedia, the AI-powered encyclopedia launched by Elon Musk's xAI last month, promises to be an ideological alternative to Wikipedia. But the tool doesn't just have a different political flavor, argues Ryan McGrady, senior fellow at the Initiative for Digital Public Infrastructure at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.</p>
<p>He recently wrote, for Tech Policy Press, that Grokipedia takes a more top-down approach to knowledge, one that harks back to less democratized eras.</p>

<p>Space is a harsh environment: it's a vacuum with freezing temperatures, super high ultraviolet radiation and, of course, almost no oxygen. But Japanese researchers have found a type of moss that doesn’t really care about much of that.</p>

      <p>Jerry Smith condemns opinion written by Jeffrey Brown and mentions Soros name 17 times in 104-page dissent</p>
<p>In a highly unusual opinion, a US federal judge berated his fellow judge with a series of personal attacks, and suggested that the billionaire George Soros had a role in an opinion striking down Texas’s congressional districts.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://electionlawblog.org/wp-content/uploads/gov.uscourts.txwd_.1150387.1439.0.pdf">104-page dissent</a> from US district judge Jerry Smith, a Reagan appointee, was issued a day after two of his colleagues on a three-judge panel said the new congressional map Texas adopted earlier this year <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/18/texas-congressional-redistricting-maps">was likely unlawful</a> because it discriminated against non-white voters.</p>

<p>“I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody,” Donald Trump claimed in 2016, “and I wouldn’t lose any voters.” Coming two weeks before the Iowa caucus, it was an unusual message from a politician, but the last nine years have served to underscore the point.</p>
<p>His “Make America great again” base, and the bulk of the Republican party, stood with him through (deep breath): two impeachments, children in cages, “very fine people on both sides”, 34 felony convictions, an insurrection, “shithole countries”, attempting to overturn an election, hush money payments to an adult film actor, “they’re rapists”, a brutal immigration crackdown, Four Seasons Total Landscaping, “grab ‘em by the pussy”, billions of dollars made by the Trump family, cosying up to dictators, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/trump-stares-into-the-sun-as-aide-screams-dont-look/#:~:text=Today%20President%20Trump%20stepped%20out,stared%20dumbly%20into%20the%20sun.">“don’t look!”</a>, mass pardons for his allies and friends, an unfinished wall, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/17/trump-liberation-day-tariff-walk-back">“liberation day”</a>, presenting himself <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/19/trump-backlash-social-media-king">as a king</a>, forcing <a href="https://cdn.britannica.com/76/233676-050-34726587/American-businessman-Donald-Trump-Jr-2018.jpg?w=300">Donald Trump Jr</a> into the public consciousness, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/nov/19/trump-emissions-policy-could-cause-climate-deaths">and more</a>.</p>

<p>Archaeologists have identified more than a dozen ancient canoes that Indigenous people apparently left behind in a sort of prehistoric parking lot along a Wisconsin lakeshore.</p>
<p>The Wisconsin Historical Society announced Wednesday that archaeologists have mapped the location of 16 canoes submerged in the lake bed of Lake Mendota in Madison. Tamara Thomsen, the state’s maritime archaeologist, said the site lies near a network of what were once Indigenous trails, suggesting ancient people left the canoes there for anyone to use as they traveled, much like a modern-day e-bike rack.</p>

<p>US officials are privately saying that they might not levy long-promised semiconductor tariffs soon, potentially delaying a centerpiece of Donald Trump’s economic agenda.</p>
<p>Officials relayed these messages over the last several days to stakeholders in the government and private industry, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter and a third person briefed on the conversations. A fourth person following the matter also said the administration was taking a more cautious approach to avoid provoking China. The discussions have not been previously reported.</p>

<p>The intensively discussed files related to the disgraced former financier and sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein passed a significant milestone on Tuesday when Congress voted overwhelmingly in favor of releasing them.</p>
<p>After months of deliberate delays and manoeuvres, the House of Representatives voted by 427 to one in favor of the Epstein Files Transparency Act, legislation which would, if enacted, require the justice department to release all unclassified materials on Epstein, who died in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges. The Senate has unanimously agreed to swiftly pass the bill, which would then head to the White House for Donald Trump’s signature.</p>

</ul>
<p>Major League Soccer announced on Wednesday that it is re-opening its investigation into Philadelphia Union sporting director Ernst Tanner. The Union said in a statement to the Guardian that they have placed Tanner on administrative leave. The move comes a day after the Guardian published <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/nov/18/philadelphia-union-ernst-tanner-mls-investigation">an investigation into Tanner’s conduct</a>.</p>
<p>Tanner had previously been under investigation by MLS after the league received a complaint from the MLS Players Association in late January. In it, the MLSPA outlined a wide range of alleged issues surrounding Tanner, which included the use of racist, sexist and homophobic language and instances of inappropriate physical contact with a staff member.</p>
<p>Made multiple misogynistic comments, including saying “women don’t belong in men’s soccer” about a female MLS referee and telling a gathering of academy players that they “should never worry about a referee, unless she’s a woman.”</p>
<p>Directed a homophobic slur at an MLS referee in 2023</p>
<p>Spoke about Black players “like they were subhuman” and suggested that Black referees “lack intelligence and capability.”</p>
<p>Touched a co-worker inappropriately “numerous times,” an allegation for which he was reported to the Union’s HR department.</p>
<p>Hired an underqualified coach who was allegedly abusive toward players on the Philadelphia Union II, the club’s reserve team that is used as a proving ground for young players from its thriving academy.</p>

(date: 2025-11-19)
      <p>
      <p>In a word: uncertainty. Retail chains like Target are pulling back on hiring temporary workers ahead of this year’s holiday shopping season as tariffs take their toll, consumer sentiment slumps, and little government data leaves them with little guidance. We’ll hear more. But first: there’s a lot riding on Nvidia results, and investors are split on predictions for the Fed’s next rate decision.</p>

      <p>Legislation would next go to Trump who indicated he would sign bill after he and his allies reversed course</p>
<p>The Senate approved legislation on Wednesday that would force the release of investigative files related to the late pedophile <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a>, the morning after a near-unanimous vote in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/house-of-representatives">US House</a>.</p>
<p>By unanimous consent, the Senate agreed to pass the measure as soon as it arrived in the chamber from the House on Tuesday, which had overwhelmingly approved the bill earlier that day in a 427-1 tally. Once the legislation is forwarded to the Senate, it will be automatically approved and cleared for Trump’s signature. The president, who dropped his opposition after it was clear it would pass, has said he would sign it.</p>

      <p>In August, Donald Trump started a campaign of aggression against Venezuela. The US president first launched airstrikes on alleged drug boats off the coast of the South American country – a move largely condemned as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/12/us-strikes-against-boats-in-caribbean-disregard-international-law-french-minister-says">extrajudicial killings</a> – then deployed US naval assets in the Caribbean.

      <p>In San Francisco, doctors say, a growing number of Latinos who work physically demanding jobs have turned to supplements that promise relief for joint and bone pain. FDA warnings are not filtering through</p>

<p>When Gloria Caballero, 52, started experiencing knee pain four years ago, her sister in Los Angeles suggested a natural remedy that a co-worker had sworn by: a supplement called Artri Ajo King. Following her advice, Caballero started buying the yellow-and-blue pills in Los Angeles and bringing them up to her home in San Francisco, where she started taking them twice a day, every day.</p>

(date: 2025-11-19)
      <p>
      <p>Some 24 million people buy health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. But subsidies and tax credits that have made these plans more affordable for the past few years are expiring, and the cost of health insurance is likely going to double, on average, for those losing subsidies. How do you plan for that? Plus, a Cloudflare outage took down sites yesterday, and tensions between China and Japan escalated.</p>

<p>Leo, the first US pontiff in the history of the Catholic church, made the remarks in response to questions about a statement adopted last week during a special assembly of US bishops that criticised the Trump administration’s mass deportations and lamented the fear and anxiety caused by immigration raids.</p>

More than 300 South Korean workers were detained and later sent back to South Korea, stoking tensions between the two nations. Plus, China has imposed a ban on all imports of Japanese seafood amid a growing dispute between Asia's two biggest economies</p>

<p>An owl found partially encased in concrete after it got inside a cement mixer in south-western Utah is expected to fly free again after it was painstakingly cleaned by animal sanctuary workers who described the bird as a “fighter”.</p>
<p>The great horned owl was found at the Black Desert Resort in the south-western part of the state and arrived at the Best Friends Animal Sanctuary in Kanab, Utah, earlier this month with its face, chest and right wing covered in dried concrete. After making sure the bird could breathe, sanctuary workers spent days cracking apart the concrete using forceps and cleaning its feathers using toothbrushes, dish soap and their fingers.</p>

      <h1>Senate agrees to pass Epstein files bill after near-unanimous House vote | First Thing</h1>

(date: 2025-11-19)
      <p>
      <p>The bill’s support in the House and Senate is a rare moment of bipartisan agreement. Plus, Trump shrugs off Khashoggi murder during Saudi prince’s visit</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/info/2018/sep/17/guardian-us-morning-briefing-sign-up-to-stay-informed"><strong>Don’t already get First Thing in your inbox? Sign up here</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>The Senate moved swiftly yesterday <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/18/house-vote-epstein-documents">to approve legislation</a> that would force the release of investigative files related to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, hours after a near-unanimous vote in the House, almost wrapping up a bipartisan effort Donald Trump had fought for months.</p>
<p><strong>How did we get here?</strong> The Epstein case returned dramatically to the public eye in July, when the justice department and FBI <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/07/jeffrey-epstein-suicide-justice-department-fbi-review-confirms">released a memo</a> saying they had nothing further to disclose about the investigation. That contradicted statements that the administration would release more information about Epstein in office.</p>
<p><strong>Why has Trump been unable to escape this</strong> <strong>case?</strong> The Epstein scandal is a core issue for a swathe of Trump’s rightwing base, some of whom believe in conspiracy theories that surround Epstein and his coterie of powerful friends. Unlike many other issues, the Epstein files have prompted rebellions from Trump’s supporters.</p>

<p>The state department is proposing to suspend 38 universities including Harvard and Yale from a federal research partnership program because they engage in diversity, equity and inclusion hiring practices, according to an internal memo and spreadsheet obtained by the Guardian.</p>
<p>The memo, dated 17 November, recommends excluding institutions from the Diplomacy Lab – a program that pairs university researchers with state department policy offices – if they “openly engage in DEI hiring practices” or set DEI objectives for candidate pools.</p>

      <h1>This school trains the workforce behind China's automated factories</h1>

(date: 2025-11-19)
      <p>
      <p>China recently came out with its latest five-year plan for growth, which will guide the world’s second largest economy through 2030. In it, top Communist Party leaders have pushed to boost the country's strength in manufacturing to the next level by upgrading older factories with advanced technologies for automation.</p>
<p>The challenge, according to the Chinese ministry of education, is that the sector has tens of millions of open jobs because there aren't enough skilled workers in the labor force to fill them.</p>
<p>One school is trying to bridge that gap. Marketplace China correspondent Jennifer Pak visited it in Nanjing city.</p>

      <h1>World Cup 2026: which countries have qualified and how did they do it?</h1>

(date: 2025-11-19)
      <p>
      <p>We now know 42 of the 48 of the teams that will play next year, but for a host of teams the race goes on via playoffs</p>
<p>All nine of the automatic places have been filled by the nine group winners, with the four best runners-up – DR Congo, Gabon, Cameroon and Nigeria – competing in November’s playoffs in Morocco. Nigeria beat Gabon 4-1 in the first semi-final, while Cameroon fell to a last-gasp 1-0 defeat by DR Congo in the second tie. <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/nov/17/nigeria-dr-congo-world-cup-2026-playoff-penalty-shootout-eric-chelle">DR Congo</a></strong> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/nov/17/nigeria-dr-congo-world-cup-2026-playoff-penalty-shootout-eric-chelle">upset Nigeria</a> after a gripping penalty shootout in the final, and go through to represent Africa in the intercontinental playoffs in March.</p>
<p><strong>Egypt</strong> Mohamed Salah scored twice as Hossam Hassan’s side beat Djibouti 3-0 in Casablanca in October and made up for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/30/sadio-mane-penalty-africa-day-of-world-cup-qualifying-joy-and-pain-senegal-egypt">missing out on Qatar 2022</a> by reaching the finals with a game in hand. This will be Egypt’s fourth finals, even though they have yet to win a game. Bizarrely, the Pharaohs did qualify for the first World Cup, in 1930, but missed their boat from Marseille to South America <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/may/13/world-cup-stunning-moments-25-conte-verde-uruguay">after a storm delayed them</a>.</p>

      <p>The White House’s $100,000 fee on new H-1B visa applications is adding extra pressure to health care systems in rural and low-income areas. Historically, the visa has been a critical pipeline for skilled health workers in hard-to-staff settings. Affected hospitals are already feeling the added strain.

      <h1>Trump administration takes major step toward dismantling the Education Department</h1>

(date: 2025-11-18)
      <p>
      <p>The U.S. Education Department is handing off some of its biggest grant programs to other federal agencies as the Trump administration accelerates its plan to shut down the department. It represents a major step forward for the administration’s dismantling of the department, which has mainly involved cutting jobs since President Donald Trump called for its elimination with an executive action in March. Six planned agreements to be signed by the Education Department will effectively move billions of dollars in grant programs to other agencies. Most notable is one that would put the Department of Labor over some of the largest federal funding streams for K-12 schools.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, the Guardian published an investigation into allegations against Philadelphia Union sporting director Ernst Tanner. The story reveals that, since his arrival at the Union in 2018, Tanner’s considerable success has come with multiple allegations of misbehavior, including alleged racist, sexist and homophobic commentary toward referees and opposition players, and an allegation of unwanted touching of a Union employee that was escalated to HR.</p>
<p>The bulk of the allegations the Guardian is reporting on are contained in a complaint filed by the MLS Players’ Association (MLSPA) to the league. The league launched its own investigation in January which recently concluded, having not corroborated the allegations.</p>
<p>Responded to a referee making contact with an opposition player by saying “why don’t you kiss him, you faggot” in a manner that could be heard by nearby fans.</p>
<p>Made multiple misogynistic comments, including saying “women don’t belong in men’s soccer” about a female MLS referee and telling a gathering of academy players that they “should never worry about a referee, unless she’s a woman.”</p>
<p>Spoke about Black players “like they were subhuman” and suggested that Black referees “lack intelligence and capability.”</p>
<p>Touched a co-worker inappropriately “numerous times,” an allegation for which he was reported to the Union’s HR department.</p>
<p>Hired an underqualified coach who was allegedly abusive toward players on the Philadelphia Union II, the club’s reserve team that is used as a proving ground for young players from its thriving academy.</p>

<p>From a box above the field at PayPal Park in San Jose, Ernst Tanner looked on. It was 10 June 2023, and his Union team were losing a physical match 2-1 to the San Jose Earthquakes. Jamiro Monteiro, a player Tanner had brought to the Union in 2019 before trading him to San Jose, was being substituted. Monteiro, clearly exhausted, trudged to the Earthquakes’ bench as referee Nima Saghafi extended his arm and ushered him along, briefly making contact.</p>
<p>It wasn’t the first time Saghafi had touched the midfielder. In the first half, with Monteiro on the ground after being sent flying by a tackle, Saghafi placed his hand on Monteiro’s back, a small gesture meant to show concern.</p>

<p>A group of survivors of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a>’s abuse gathered outside the US Capitol on Tuesday morning, demanding justice, accountability and the release of the justice department files related to the late convicted sex offender.</p>

<p>The US district judge Michael Shipp, sitting in Trenton, handed down a 37-year sentence on Friday to Eliyahu “Eli” Weinstein, 51, of Lakewood, who is also known as Mike Konig. Shipp also ruled that Weinstein must pay $44,294,803 in restitution, which is due immediately, according to court documents.</p>

      <p>Delivery company struggling to convince US chain Kroger, its most important customer, of the virtues of automation</p>
<p>That’s quite a stock market journey: from 180p <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jul/20/ocado-slash-shares-float-price">at listing 15 years ago</a> to the mighty heights of £29 during the locked-down Covid year of 2020 and now – oh dear – all the way back down to 180p. Welcome to Ocado, which looked like the future of grocery retailing once upon a time but now seems to be struggling to convince its most important customer of the virtues of robots and automation.</p>
<p>There is no positive gloss to put on news that Kroger, the US supermarket chain, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/nov/18/ocado-shares-drop-after-us-partner-announces-warehouse-closures-kroger">is closing three of its eight warehouses</a> that use Ocado’s technology.

If Ocado could prove the worth of its kit in the world’s largest consumer market, went the bulls’ argument, valuation doubts would disappear.</p>

      <p>Critics accuse the US president of trying to ‘shut women journalists up’ with ‘demeaning language’</p>
<p>Donald Trump, who has a history of making extremely personal attacks on female journalists, referred to a Bloomberg News correspondent as a “piggy” during a clash onboard Air Force One on Friday.</p>
<p>While the remark did not initially get much attention, it picked up some traction on Tuesday and has drawn backlash from fellow journalists, including some who have previously been attacked by Trump themselves.</p>

The aid is aimed at growers of fruits, vegetables, and tree nuts. As for aid from President Donald Trump's tariffs? The government's still busy crunching the numbers. Plus, we'll discuss what direction the U.S. economy is headed and hear how AI can help companies soften the blow from tariffs.</p>

<p>The archdiocese of New Orleans has begun a three-week confirmation trial that will determine whether a federal bankruptcy judge signs off on a $230m settlement meant to compensate 650 clergy abuse survivors and resolve one of the US’s longest-running and costliest church bankruptcies.</p>
<p>US bankruptcy judge Meredith Grabill will decide whether the plan – five and a half years in the making – is fair to the survivors and dozens of other creditors who have waited through repeated delays, contentious negotiations and a protracted legal fight over a 2021 state law giving survivors of decades-old child sexual abuse the right to sue.</p>

      <p>
      <p>After being expelled from his homeland in 1972, the academic has grappled with questions of political belonging – a major theme of his son’s mayoral campaign</p>
<p>The night before Mahmood Mamdani was expelled from Uganda in 1972, a senior professor from the university where he had been employed as a lowly teaching assistant wandered into his family home, looking for spoils. The rest of the family had already left – for the UK, the US and Tanzania – but 26-year-old Mamdani had decided to remain until the final day of the three-month period that Idi Amin, the Ugandan president, had designated for all Asians to leave the country. Passing over the furniture and other remnants of decades of family life, the professor hit upon a carton of Johnnie Walker Red, which Mamdani invited him to take home.</p>

(date: 2025-11-18)
      <p>
      <p>New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani swept the election on a campaign all about affordability. One pillar of that platform was the idea of city-owned grocery stores. The thinking: Prices at these city-owned stores would be lower because they’d operate in city-owned spaces, so they wouldn’t have to pay rent or property taxes. Other cities have tried this. How'd the experiment go? But first: the world's largest official creditor and rising utility costs.</p>

<p>But there could be in years hence more definitive sightings if Mighty Earth, a US-headquartered rewilding organization, convinces state and local authorities, along with Vermonters in general, that returning the top-level predator – known in various regions as the cougar, puma, panther and, in the north-east, catamount – to the region.</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>Violence has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/18/west-bank-surge-settler-violence-israel-palestine">increased across the occupied West Bank</a> as Palestinian farmers try to harvest their olive trees before the end of the season, in the face of a campaign of harassment by groups of armed and aggressive Israeli settlers.</p>
<p><strong>How many attacks were there last month?</strong> The UN logged more than 260 attacks resulting in Palestinian casualties or damage to property in the West Bank in October alone – the highest monthly count since they began monitoring in 2006.</p>
<p><strong>What’s the latest on the Gaza peace plan?</strong> Yesterday, the UN security council <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/18/un-security-council-votes-to-endorse-donald-trumps-gaza-plan">endorsed proposals</a> put forward by Donald Trump for a lasting peace in Gaza, including the deployment of an international stabilization force and a possible path to a sovereign Palestinian state. China and Russia abstained.</p>

      <p>
      <p>When I was a college basketball player, some believed we were treated differently from other Black and Brown people. An event last weekend suggests otherwise</p>
<p>It was 1996, my first day stepping foot on Syracuse University’s campus. I saw a big student protest was taking place so, with my freshman’s inquisitive mind, I ventured over to see what was going on.</p>
<p>I listened to a passionate sista named Kathy Ade, the president of Syracuse’s student African-American Society. She stood there with her Bantu knots and a megaphone addressing the crowd, discussing the fact that campus security was now going to be able to carry pepper spray. In the 90s – which my daughter Baby Sierra calls “the 1900s,” just to keep me humble – campus security carrying pepper spray was a big deal. Now, they all carry guns.</p>

      <h1>Trump’s focus on race backfires as voters punish economic failings</h1>

(date: 2025-11-18)
      <p>
      <p>The Maga base rallied on inflation and racial grievances, but stressing race over the economy is costing the US president</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s 2024 campaign strategy leaned heavily on two sources of grievance among the Maga base. The first was the rising cost of living, propelled by the sharp burst of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/inflation">inflation</a> that peaked at 9% a year in July 2022. Though inflation had receded to 2.7% by election day, frustration over prices convinced many voters that Trump would be a superior steward of the economy. The other theme was race.</p>
<p>The strategy won the presidency. Then Trump made a mistake: focusing relentlessly on hostility towards immigrants and the diverse citizens of urban America, the president pretty much ignored – nay, worsened – his supporters’ economic woes. In elections earlier this month, US economic grievances came back to bite him. Pummeled by voters, Trump is now <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/14/trump-tariffs-food">trying to recover</a> his economic narrative. But it may be too late.</p>

      <h1>The Luka Era begins: inside the transformation powering the post-LeBron Lakers</h1>

(date: 2025-11-18)
      <p>
      <p>Shipped out of Dallas and dropped into Hollywood, Dončić has responded with a leaner body, a louder voice and a growing command of the Lakers’ post-LeBron future</p>
<p>It’s been nine and a half months since the trade that rocked the sports world <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/feb/02/anthony-davis-luka-doncic-trade-mavericks-lakers-nba-basketball">was broken via a Shams Charania tweet</a>. It was such a shock that the majority of his followers assumed he’d been hacked. Fresh off of a trip to the NBA finals, the young Slovenian superstar Luka Dončić was shipped off in the middle of the night to the Los Angeles Lakers for Anthony Davis, and the NBA as we know it was changed for ever. The fallout from one of the most shocking trades in sports history is still evolving: disgraced Mavericks general manager Nico Harrison, who spearheaded the transaction, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/nov/11/dallas-mavericks-fire-nico-harrison-luka-doncic-trade">was let go by the team last week</a>, in a move Mavericks fans have been <a href="https://www.keranews.org/news/2025-02-08/hundreds-of-dallas-mavericks-fans-protest-luka-doncic-trade-to-lakers">loudly clamoring for</a> since news broke that their homegrown franchise player was being abruptly cast out to sea. But on the other side of the coin was a mixed blessing and a new beginning: Dončić, who had imagined spending his entire career in Dallas like his mentor Dirk Nowitzki, suddenly found himself recast as the face of the NBA’s most famous franchise under the bright lights of Hollywood. And, as it turns out, the future is now.</p>
<p>While Dončić’s breakup with the Mavericks was both <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/feb/27/luka-doncic-anthony-davis-trade-fallout-human-element">very public and very messy</a> (the Mavs were not shy about vocalizing their reasoning for the move, and painting the 26-year-old in an unflattering light in the process), the silver linings showed themselves quickly. Dončić might not have considered himself suited for the Los Angeles spotlight, but with his flair for the dramatic and a feel for the sport’s theater, playing for such a high-profile franchise has proved an unexpectedly good fit. And it couldn’t have worked out better for the Lakers: the team had been staring at an uncertain future, with the retirement of 40-year-old LeBron James looming, and Davis’s injury history creating a cloud of doubt around his ability to be the No 1 option in the eventual aftermath. Enter Luka stage right: a ticket to franchise salvation, equipped with the newfound motivation that can only be borne from being publicly and mercilessly dragged through the mud.</p>

      <h1>Money lured Anthony Joshua to circus fight but he could really hurt Jake Paul | Donald McRae</h1>

(date: 2025-11-17)
      <p>
      <p>The so-called Judgment Day will generate millions of dollars and attract huge ratings, but leave boxing a little more broken</p>
<p>The unsurprising confirmation of “a colossal global showdown” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/nov/12/anthony-joshua-jake-paul-december-miami-fight-netflix">between Jake Paul and Anthony Joshua</a> arrived on Monday morning with a dull thud. That grand description of an eight-round scrap between a former YouTuber and a former world heavyweight champion was supplied by Paul’s company, Most Valuable Promotions, which also announced that the contest will be screened live on Netflix on 19 December and called Judgment Day.</p>
<p>Boxing operates in a netherworld that appears to have sunk far beyond any fear of judgment, while Paul has always had delusions of grandeur as a novice pro. But even boxing may have to consider its own culpability should Paul be badly hurt and end up in hospital after this fully sanctioned bout with regulation 10oz gloves is held in Miami.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/us-supreme-court">US supreme court</a> agreed on Monday to hear a defense by the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> of the government’s authority to limit the processing of asylum claims at ports of entry along the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-mexico-border">US-Mexico border</a>.</p>
<p>The court took up the administration’s appeal of a lower court’s determination that the “metering” policy, under which US immigration officials could stop asylum seekers at the border and decline to process their claims, violated federal law.</p>

(date: 2025-11-17)
      <p>
      <p>After President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping met in South Korea late last month, some tariffs have been suspended or lowered, and China said it will restart purchases of U.S. soybeans and other agricultural goods. To hear about the mood among Chinese buyers and U.S. exporters, Marketplace's Jennifer Park recently attended a trade show in Shanghai. But first: an ethics violation by a former Fed and the impacts of delayed government data.</p>

(date: 2025-11-17)
      <p>
      <p>Experts believe decision is designed to pressure Venezuela’s leader into stepping down with threat of military force</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/12/us-venezuela-trump-maduro-drugs-regime-change">Is US preparing to attack Venezuela and how has Maduro regime responded?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The US has said it will designate a putative <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/venezuela">Venezuelan</a> drug cartel allegedly led by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/nicolas-maduro">Nicolás Maduro</a> as a foreign terrorist organization, as the Trump administration sent more mixed messages over its crusade against Venezuela’s authoritarian leader.</p>
<p>The move to target the already proscribed group, the Cartel de los Soles (Cartel of the Suns), was announced by Marco Rubio on Sunday. “Headed by the illegitimate Nicolás Maduro, the group has corrupted the institutions of government in Venezuela and is responsible for terrorist violence conducted by and with other designated FTOs as well as for trafficking drugs into the United States and Europe,” the US secretary of state tweeted, generating excitement among hardline adversaries of Maduro who interpreted the announcement as proof Washington was preparing to intensify its push to force the South American dictator from power.</p>

What might those numbers be able to tell us (whenever they do come out) about some of the impacts of the president’s tariffs? Plus, China has a glut of EVs, and that oversupply is starting to spill over into the rest of the world.</p>

      <h1>First Thing: Trump tells Republicans to vote to release Epstein files, in reversal of previous stance</h1>

(date: 2025-11-17)
      <p>
      <p>The US president says he backs lawmakers’ efforts to release the files before an expected House vote this week. Plus: is there a dark side to gratitude?</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/info/2018/sep/17/guardian-us-morning-briefing-sign-up-to-stay-informed"><strong>Don’t already get First Thing in your inbox? Sign up here</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>Donald Trump has urged his fellow Republicans in Congress to vote for the release of files related to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/17/trump-tells-republicans-to-vote-to-release-epstein-files-saying-we-have-nothing-to-hide">reversing his previous resistance to such a move</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Why the sudden U-turn?</strong> The House was expected to vote to release the files anyway, as early as tomorrow. There has been fervent suspicion within Trump’s usually loyal Maga base that the administration is hiding details of Epstein’s crimes to protect the rich elite with whom the financier associated – including Trump.</p>
<p><strong>Has Trump made up with Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has been calling for the files to be released?</strong> No, he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/nov/17/donald-trump-jeffrey-epstein-files-republicans-democrats-world-cup-us-politics-live-news-updates">doubled down on his attacks</a> against the Republican lawmaker, despite his reversal on resisting the release of the Epstein files. Greene, meanwhile, has said <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/16/marjorie-taylor-greene-trump-remarks">she hopes they can make it up</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What does Israel’s limited data tell us about the rate of detainee casualties?</strong> Israeli authorities only provided comprehensive data for the first eight months of the war. During this period, official figures show an unprecedented casualty rate among Palestinian detainees, on average one death every four days.</p>

      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> As COP30 in Brazil enters its second week, one of the key agreements protecting the Amazon rainforest is under threat from powerful Brazilian agri-business interests. Currently, a pact bans the sale of soy beans — Brazil’s largest agricultural export — grown on Amazon land deforested after 2008. Then, shares in Japanese retail and travel-related companies fell after China urged citizens not to visit the country over remarks made by Japan's prime minister about Taiwan.</p>

      <h1>Bridging the uncanny valley of lab-grown meat</h1>

(date: 2025-11-17)
      <p>
      <p>About a third of global greenhouse gas emissions come from our food systems, and livestock production is a big part of that. Experts largely agree that one of the biggest actions individuals can take to lower emissions is to eat less meat.</p>
<p>But that's a hard sell for a lot of consumers. Americans have actually been eating more meat in recent years, and sales of plant-based meat alternatives have dropped.</p>
<p>There are a lot of companies out there trying to innovate climate-friendly meat and alternatives for the future.</p>
<p>For our podcast &quot;How We Survive,&quot; Marketplace's Amy Scott visits a lab at Columbia University where researchers are figuring out how to make a more convincing and enjoyable fake meat.</p>

      <h1>Déjà boo: Sam Darnold didn’t think he’d see ghosts on the field again. Then he faced the Rams</h1>

(date: 2025-11-17)
      <p>
      <p>The Seahawks quarterback has looked like an MVP this season. But his old failings returned in Los Angeles on Sunday</p>
<p>The biggest game of Week 11 was undoubtedly the matchup between the Los Angeles Rams and the Seattle Seahawks. Both teams came in with 7-2 records, and were seemingly evenly matched on both sides of the ball, with dynamic offenses and stingy defenses. In the end, it was a defensive battle that the Rams won, 21-19, by the skin of their teeth.</p>
<p>Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold, who had played <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/nov/14/nfl-midseason-ish-awards-darnolds-rise-to-mvp-and-a-surprising-browns-rookie">at a near-MVP level this season</a> for the most part, did absolutely nothing to help his team – and plenty to hurt them. Darnold matched his career high with four interceptions, completing 29 of 44 passes for 279 yards, no touchdowns, those picks, and a passer rating of 45.5.</p>

<p>Josh Allen has become the first NFL player to have two games with three touchdowns passing and three rushing. He achieved the feat as he led the Buffalo Bills (7-3) to victory over Baker Mayfield and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (6-4). Allen’s last TD was a rugged nine-yard run with 2:35 left that put the game away. The Bills benched struggling receiver Keon Coleman in a bid to spark their passing game, and each of Allen’s three touchdown passes went for 25 yards or more. He finished 19 of 30 for 317 yards, and the Bills overcame his two first-half interceptions. The game featured nine lead changes.</p>

      <h1>Merchants’ ‘victory’ over credit card fees will just complicate things more for them</h1>

(date: 2025-11-16)
      <p>
      <p>Do small business owners think that Visa and Mastercard won’t just recoup their fees elsewhere?</p>
<p>Want to buy a new shirt from your friendly neighborhood small business? In some cases, be prepared to pay out 2.5% more as a “financing” fee because you’re using a credit card. Enjoying that meal at the local diner? Better have cash or you could be subject to the same fee. Grabbing a bag of chips and a soda at the local convenience store? Oops … Unless you’re prepared to spend a minimum of 10 bucks you can’t use your credit card, sorry.</p>
<p>I’ve always been irritated by these practices. And I know I’m not alone. Who carries cash anymore? Why are we, the customer, being shamed because we choose to buy something using what has become a standard form of payment over something that’s clearly a thing of the past?</p>

      <p>
      <p>Long after his conviction for sexual abuse, people in royalty, academia, business, journalism and politics sought his ear</p>
<p>He got by with a little help from his friends. From British royalty to White House alumni, from a Silicon Valley investor to a leftwing academic, connections and influence were the ultimate currency for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a>.</p>
<p>Yet none appeared to challenge Epstein over his horrific crimes. If silence is complicity, the casual disdain of the elite circles he moved in spoke volumes.</p>

<p>At first light in Massachusetts bay, a North Atlantic right whale threads the shallows with her calf tucked into her slipstream. She surfaces, and the V-shaped breath – two brief feathers of vapor – vanishes in the cold air.</p>
<p>The calf is roughly three months old, about the length of a small truck, still learning the rhythm: rise, breathe, tuck back into mother’s wake. They are doing what every mammal mother and baby do: moving toward food and a safer place.</p>

<p>Concerns over a small brush fire that reignited days later into the mammoth Palisades fire – the <a href="https://www.wildfirela.org/history/">most destructive</a> in Los Angeles history – have grown in recent weeks amid reports that firefighters were ordered to leave the original site of the smaller blaze despite their concerns the ground was still smoldering.</p>

      <p>Leona Tate has built a center at the former school she and her two six-year-old friends braved angry crowds to attend – the same day as Ruby Bridges’ better-known experience</p>
<p>Gail Etienne still remembers her first day at McDonogh 19 elementary school in New Orleans’ Lower Ninth Ward. As her family pulled up to the school in the car with the federal marshals, they saw crowds of angry people screaming. Some carried garbage cans and sticks. Others were holding picket signs against school integration.</p>
<p>“I’ll never forget it,” Etienne said. “I saw this one lady was pregnant and had a garbage can top in her hand. I’m wondering, at six years old, what could I have done at six years old to these people to make them act the way they were acting? I really thought that if they could get to me, they’d want to kill me. I didn’t know why. What had I done? I was just going to school.”</p>

<p>In a post on X, Greene said that “a hot bed of threats against me are being fueled and egged on by the most powerful man in the world”, without referring to Trump by name, adding it was “the man I supported and helped get elected”.</p>

<p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from withholding federal funding and threatening hefty fines against the University of California amid the administration’s attempts to coerce elite US universities into adopting and promoting conservative ideals.</p>

      <h1>Mamdani’s appointment of Lina Khan a warning to private equity, experts say</h1>

      <p>Ex-FTC chair was among first to go after practice of folding local firms into larger ones leading to higher prices</p>
<p>Experts say New York mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani’s selection of Lina Khan, the former Federal Trade Commission (FTC) chair, for his transition team acts as a warning to private equity firms in the state that have raised rents and monopolized local healthcare industries.</p>
<p>Throughout the US, private equity has increasingly monopolized industries through the practice of “roll-ups”, acquiring many small local firms and rolling them into one larger firm, giving them power to simultaneously raise prices and lower quality.</p>

<p>After the dramatic ousting of the top drug regulator at the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) two weeks ago, officials have scrambled to find a replacement in a process that has revealed the agency’s internal cracks and tensions.</p>
<p>It’s troubling news for a regulatory agency that has previously enjoyed a reputation for stability and consistency.</p>

      <h1>Taylor Swift’s silence on the Trump administration using her music speaks volumes | Alim Kheraj</h1>

(date: 2025-11-15)
      <p>
      <p>Official Trump social media accounts have been using The Life of a Showgirl snippets to promote his agenda. Why has Swift, who once wanted ‘to be on the right side of history’, said nothing?</p>
<p>In the last two weeks, the Trump administration has used music from Taylor Swift’s latest album, The Life of a Showgirl, in three posts on social media. The <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@whitehouse/video/7568317055292738830">first</a>, shared by the official White House account on TikTok, was a patriotic slide show of images set to lead single The Fate of Ophelia. As Swift sings “pledge allegiance to your hands, your team, your vibes”, the video cuts to pictures of the US flag, President Trump, the vice-president, JD Vance, and the first and second ladies. The second and third were posted by Team Trump, the official account for the Trump Campaign. <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@teamtrump/video/7569701713712631095?lang=en">One</a>, set to Father Figure, riffs on the lyric “this empire belongs to me” with the caption “this empire belongs to @President Donald J Trump”, while the <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@teamtrump/video/7569982996640501023?lang=en">other</a>, celebrating Melania Trump winning something called the Patriot of the year award, is soundtracked by Opalite.</p>
<p>The Trump administration has found itself in dicey waters for using popular music in the past. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/sep/09/white-stripes-trump-lawsuit-seven-nation-army">The White Stripes</a> and the estate of <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c89w28w13zxo">Isaac Hayes</a> have both attempted to sue the administration for using their music without permission, while artists including Celine Dion, Beyoncé, Rihanna, Abba and Foo Fighters have released statements demanding Trump stop using their songs at campaign rallies and public appearances. Most recently, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/nov/08/olivia-rodrigo-trump-video">Olivia Rodrigo condemned</a> the administration after the official Department of Homeland Security and White House Instagram account used her song All-American Bitch on a video promoting its controversial deportation efforts (the song was later removed by Instagram).</p>

<p>Before deciding to waive her anonymity in September, Lacerda was known for years as “Minor Victim-1” – unknown, unheard, another teenager groomed and abused by the paedophile financier.</p>

<p>The texts, released by the House oversight committee on Wednesday, show that as early as June 2018, the pair were devising responses to the gathering storm of public outrage about Epstein’s criminal history, his favorable treatment by the justice system, and his friendships with powerful figures in business, politics and academia.</p>

<p>Many services on Salt Spring Island are experiencing a labour shortage, driven by a lack of housing workers can afford.
It’s pushed businesses around the island to offer housing for workers in order to improve recruitment — and fierce debate on how to solve the island's affordable housing crisis.</p>

<p>A century-old Inuvialuit kayak once used for beluga and whale hunts, and 61 other cultural objects from First Nations, Métis and Inuit communities have long been held in Vatican Museums vaults.

The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/14/us/politics/trump-affordability-economy.html">reported on Friday</a> that the Trump administration is pivoting to an affordability message and considering lowering some tariffs rates.</p>
<p>The administration has floated policies that would lower prices for coffee and fruit, spoken about a 50-year mortgage proposal, and Trump has mused on social media about giving Americans $2,000 funded by tariff revenue.</p>

<p>Celtic are to accelerate talks with Wilfried Nancy over the weekend as the Columbus Crew manager edges closer to replacing Brendan Rodgers in Glasgow. Celtic are understood to have informed the Major League Soccer side on Friday of their plans, with any compensation required to coax the Frenchman not regarded as problematic. Nancy is believed to be keen on the switch.</p>
<p>Celtic hope to have Nancy in place by the time they visit St Mirren next weekend, which would bring an end to Martin O’Neill’s caretaker spell. O’Neill was due to meet Celtic’s main shareholder, Dermot Desmond, in London on Friday. The second tenure of Rodgers in Glasgow <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/27/brendan-rodgers-resigns-celtic-martin-oneill">ended in acrimony</a> in late October, with Desmond taking public aim at the former Liverpool manager.</p>

<p>The exchanges, from 2013 to early 2019, showed the two men sharing personal – and sometimes unseemly – views about politics and relationships.</p>

<p>It was a foggy October afternoon on the central California coast when the Marine Mammal Center got a call on their public hotline: there were distressed cries coming from the frigid waters in Morro Bay.</p>
<p>The center’s experts were able to determine that the calls – which sounded almost like a human baby screeching – were coming from a roughly two-week-old sea otter pup that had been separated from its mother.</p>

      <h1>Does the Fed now have a "dueling mandate"?</h1>

(date: 2025-11-14)
      <p>
      <p>Even though we haven’t gotten recent economic data because of the government shutdown, there’s still plenty of speculation that the next Fed meeting will be a contentious one. We hear from Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG, about how the slowing job market and creeping inflation may force the guardians of interest rates into uncomfortable compromises. Plus, a look at why the Trump administration is lowering some tariffs on imported food items from Latin America. And, a chat with McKinsey’s Michael Chui about how companies are utilizing AI and what that means for the workforce.</p>

      <p>Text messages released by US House show convicted sex offender coaching Maga influencer on political messaging. Plus, readers’ favourite photo booth moments 100 years after its invention</p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>The convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein apparently served as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/14/jeffrey-epstein-steve-bannon">a behind-the-scenes adviser to the former Trump official and Maga influencer Steve Bannon</a> during an August 2018 media campaign to defend Trump and his agenda, and to promote Bannon’s media ventures.</p>
<p><strong>What else has been released in the flood of recent Epstein emails?</strong> Among many, many other things, one email shows an exchange between him and an associate in which they discuss “girls” and travel. The justice department continues to downplay the possibility that other men were involved in Epstein’s abuse of teen girls.</p>
<p><strong>What’s happening with</strong> <strong>rest of the Epstein files?</strong> Trump is facing the prospect of a politically damaging congressional vote to release the files, after attempts to press two members of Congress to withdraw their backing for it appeared to have failed.</p>
<p><strong>What exactly is climate finance? Who pays it? And who gets it?</strong> Sixteen years ago, at the climate summit in Copenhagen, rich and polluting countries pledged to provide <span class="math inline">\(100bn (£76bn) each year by 2020 [so that poorer countries could cut their emissions and adapt to a hotter world](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/nov/14/what-exactly-is-climate-finance-who-pays-it-and-who-gets-it).

<p>Pep Guardiola has done a lot with his 1,000 matches as a manager.

(date: 2025-11-14)
      <p>
      <p>How optimistic are small business owners nowadays? According to a recent survey, the picture is downbeat — many owners have been dealing with tariffs and other stressors. We delve into the data. And, a chat with the co-founder of a non-profit restaurant in New York City that serves up economically inclusive meals priced with a sliding scale based on what diners can pay.</p>

<p>As the Trump administration and Texas’s governor, Greg Abbott, restrict free speech on college campuses, two professors at the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD) are suing the university for retaliation stemming from 2024 arrests at a peaceful campus protest.</p>
<p>History professors Ben Wright and Rosemary Admiral argue they should not have been arrested in the first place at the 1 May 2024 demonstration, where they were standing between their students and heavily armed law enforcement.</p>

<p>The development would be just the latest in a series of moves by Trump acolytes at the Department of Justice who are transforming the voting section of the agency from an office focused on protecting Americans’ voting rights to one that is in lockstep with an election denial movement that incessantly demands investigations and drastic reductions in access to the polls based on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s lies about elections.</p>

<p>The head of an antisemitism watchdog has come out against the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) and other groups for their “divisive, hyperbolic and aggressive response” to Zohran Mamdani’s election, warning that a combative stance towards the New York City mayor-elect is a gift to the far right.</p>
<p>“The instrumentalizers of antisemitism are cheering on the divisions being created in New York City, because that’s their goal: divide people, divide Jews from each other,” said Jonathan Jacoby, the director of the Nexus Project, which works to combat antisemitism and its political abuse.</p>

      <p>
      <p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Donald Trump is set to cut import taxes on products like coffee, bananas, and beef as part of trade agreements with four Latin American countries, aimed at easing food prices. A tariff of 10% will stay on most goods from Guatemala, Argentina, and El Salvador, as will a 15% tax on imports from Ecuador. But staples like coffee and bananas, which the U.S. can’t produce enough of, will be exempt.</p>

      <h1>From conscience to platforming Trump: inside the slow death of ‘woke’ ESPN</h1>

(date: 2025-11-14)
      <p>
      <p>The broadcaster was once attacked by critics for being too progressive. But that stance appears to have changed for good in Trump’s second term</p>
<p>“What happened to the Redskins, by the way?” Donald Trump asked in <a href="https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/Articles/2025/11/12/mcafee-defends-trump-interview-amid-backlash-over-veterans-day-appearance/">an interview on the Pat McAfee Show</a> that notably did not stick to sports. His call-in appearance on Tuesday’s program to mark Veterans Day was meant to be a major coup for ESPN, the first time Trump had been interviewed on the network as a sitting president. But viewers could have just as easily been mistaken into believing they were watching Fox News.</p>
<p>Trump took his usual shots at Joe Biden, claimed credit for the Department for Veteran Affairs’ high approval ratings and declared victory over the Democrats in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/13/government-shutdown-timeline">a government shut down</a> that dragged on for a depressing 43 days. Rather than push back against the political self-promotion, McAfee cheered Trump on before opening the floor to his lackeys to ask him which NFL coach would make a great president. It was all delivered live from South Carolina’s Parris Island, the US’s oldest Marine depot, which gave McAfee further excuse to goad the commander-in-chief into barking “oorah” – a Marine battle cry that the recruits present were duty bound to respond to in kind. The only thing missing from the jingoistic scene was a monument to ESPN’s fallen integrity.</p>

      <p>
      <p>This week we learned the Japanese investment firm Softbank sold all of its stake in the juggernaut chipmaker Nvidia. We'll get into why on today's “Marketplace Tech Bytes: Week in Review.” Plus, Apple is reportedly pushing back the release of its thinnest iPhone, the Air, and Wikipedia is asking AI companies, once again, to pay for scraping its data.</p>
<p>But first, back to that big move by Softbank and its CEO, Masayoshi Son. It cashed out its stake in Nvidia in October, the same month that the chipmaker hit a <span class="math inline">\(5 trillion valuation. The \)</span>5.8 billion it netted will be redirected to OpenAI, part of a promised $30 billion to be invested in the maker of ChatGPT.</p>
<p>Marketplace’s Meghan McCarty Carino spoke with Anita Ramaswamy, columnist at The Information, about what all this means.</p>

      <h1>10 Years Ago, Justin Bieber Confronted a Strange New Era On Purpose</h1>

(date: 2025-11-14)

      <h1>NFL midseason-ish awards: Darnold’s rise to MVP and a surprising Browns rookie</h1>

(date: 2025-11-14)
      <p>
      <p>With the season more than halfway done, we look at the outstanding figures from the 2025 campaign so far</p>
<p><strong>Sam Darnold, QB, Seahawks.</strong> With apologies to Jonathan Taylor, we know how this story goes. MVP doesn’t stand for Most Valuable Player anymore. It stands for Most Valuable Quarterback on a 12-win team with a nice storyline. That gives us three frontrunners: Matthew Stafford, Drake Maye and Darnold.</p>

      <p>Midfielder is preparing for NWSL semi-final on her latest loan and hopes road will lead her to Gunners’ first team</p>
<p>The headline on Arsenal’s website in early August 2023 was short and sweet. “Teenage trio to join Watford on dual agreement,” it read. That trio included Michelle Agyemang and Katie Reid, two players whose names were known to the keenest of fans then and who have since become part of mainstream conversation for hugely positive reasons. More recently they have hit the headlines for a more devastating reason, having both sustained anterior cruciate ligament injuries.</p>
<p>In any footballer’s career a bit of good fortune is needed, alongside a manager being brave enough to take a chance on you. The knee injury that led to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/21/leah-williamson-to-miss-start-of-arsenals-wsl-season-due-to-knee-injury#:~:text=Williamson%20ruptured%20an%20anterior%20cruciate,injuries%20are%20not%20directly%20linked.">Leah Williamson missing the start</a> of the Women’s Super League season created the space for Reid to be given an opportunity in the first team, while an AlessiaRusso ankle knock led to Agyemang’s first England call-up in April. Both subsequently shone, making the forced interruptions to their respective professional journeys <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/nov/11/katie-reid-arsenal-womens-football-acl-injuries">especially cruel</a>.</p>

<p>A British political commentator who was detained by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usimmigration">immigration</a> authorities in the US over his pro-Palestinian advocacy said shortly after returning to the UK on Thursday that his detention was “less an attack on me and more an attack on Americans and the rights of Americans themselves”.</p>
<p>Sami Hamdi arrived in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london">London</a> on Thursday , three weeks after he was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents at San Francisco international airport while on a speaking tour in the US. He agreed to leave the country after being guaranteed the right to apply for a new US visa, which he says he plans to do.</p>

      <h1>Seal seeks refuge on boat while fleeing killer whales - video</h1>

(date: 2025-11-14)
      <p>
      <p>A wildlife photographer out on a whale watching trip in waters off Seattle captured dramatic video and photos of a pod of killer whales hunting a seal that survived only by clambering onto the stern of her boat. Charvet Drucker was on a rented 20-foot (6-meter) boat near her home on an island in the Salish Sea about 40 miles northwest of Seattle when she spotted a pod of at least eight killer whales, also known as orcas. Drucker used the zoom lens on her camera to spot a harbor seal that was trying to flee from the pod</p>

      <p>Attempts to persuade two female members of Congress to withdraw backing for petition appear to have failed – key US politics stories from Thursday 13 November at a glance</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> is facing the prospect of a politically damaging congressional vote on releasing the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a> files after attempts to press two female members of Congress to withdraw their backing for it appeared to have failed.</p>
<p>The reported refusal of Lauren Boebert, a Republican representative from Colorado, and Nancy Mace, from South Carolina, to remove their names from a discharge petition to force a vote leaves Trump exposed on an issue that carries the possibility of turning segments of his Maga base against him.</p>

      <p>Move escalates legal battle over a redistricting effort designed to help Democrats flip House seats in 2026</p>
<p>The justice department on Thursday <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-governor-gavin-newsom-californias-race-based-redistricting-plan">joined a lawsuit</a> brought by California Republicans to block the state’s new congressional map, escalating a legal battle over a redistricting effort designed to give Democrats a better chance of retaking the House of Representatives next year.</p>
<p>The lawsuit, filed in federal court in California, challenges the congressional map championed by Gavin Newsom, the state’s Democratic governor, in response to a Republican gerrymander in Texas, sought by Donald Trump. The <a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025-11-13-United-States-complaint-in-intervention.pdf">justice department’s intervention</a> in the case sets up a high-profile showdown between the Trump administration and Newsom, one of the president’s chief antagonists and a possible 2028 contender.</p>
