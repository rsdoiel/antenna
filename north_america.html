<p>
President Donald Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on American imports,
with the levies coming in higher than expected. Do we need to be
stockpiling our carts to get in front of rising costs? We asked
economists how they’re personally preparing for higher prices. Plus,
Reema and Kimberly unpack international responses as countries buckle up
to negotiate — or take retaliatory measures. Also, why are we putting
tariffs on uninhabited islands near Antarctica?

Keyed to President Donald Trump’s tariff announcement today, Kimberly

speech and how Sabri fell victim to April Fools’ Day shenanigans! (Note:
This episode was recorded prior to Trump’s speech.)<em> </em>

hoped for a mergers and acquisitions comeback this year. Instead, deals
have tanked.</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-02, from: Market Place</p>
<p>The first quarter of 2025 was the slowest first quarter for M&amp;A
deals in more than a decade, according to Dealogic. That’s largely
thanks to uncertainty about the economy and the regulatory
environment.</p>

problem with running the government like a business</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-01, from: Market Place, Make me Smart</p>
<p>
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
</p>
<p>
The idea that the government should be run more like a business isn’t
new. But with two businessmen, Donald Trump and Elon Musk, now taking a
proverbial chainsaw to the federal bureaucracy all in the name
“efficiency,” this theory is being put to the test. While it’s an
appealing idea, Philip Joyce, professor of public policy at the
University of Maryland School of Public Policy, said governments can’t
afford to take risks the way businesses can. On the show today, Joyce
explains the origins of the idea that the government should be run like
a business, how we define “success” differently for the two entities,
and how the way Trump and Musk do business is showing up in the White
House.

Then, we’ll break down the high stakes of today’s special elections in
Wisconsin and Florida. Plus, reflections on serendipitous moments in
walkable communities and what we gain by admitting we were wrong.

<h2 id="the-tariff-countdown">The tariff countdown</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-01, from: Market Place, Make me Smart</p>
<p>
President Donald Trump has promised that a fresh wave of tariffs on
April 2 will usher in an era of growth in American manufacturing. But
does history bear that out? We’ll explain how steel tariffs under
President George W. Bush did more harm than good. And, in response to
Trump’s trade agenda, the “buy Canadian” movement is gaining steam.
American exporters are already feeling it. Plus, we’ll smile about
flowers, parties and the unspoken rules of texting.

The artificial intelligence cloud computing provider CoreWeave sold
shares to the public today with so-so results. Because it’s the first
major IPO of the current generative AI era, some argue that CoreWeave
could be a barometer of the AI boom. We’ll get into it. And, a federal
appeals court ruled in favor of President Donald Trump’s firings of
independent agency heads. The case will likely make its way to the
Supreme Court. Plus, we’ll play a round of Half Full/Half Empty!
