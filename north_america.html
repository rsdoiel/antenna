removes fake accounts in Moldova ahead of presidential election</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>STOCKHOLM — Meta Platforms said on Friday that it had removed a
network of group accounts targeting Russian speakers in Moldova ahead of
the country’s October 20 election, for violation of the company’s policy
on fake accounts.</p>
<p>Authorities in Moldova, an ex-Soviet state lying between Romania and
Ukraine, said they had blocked dozens of Telegram channels and chat bots
linked to a drive to pay voters to cast “no” ballots in a referendum on
European Union membership held alongside the presidential election.</p>
<p>Pro-European President Maia Sandu is seeking a second term in the
election and called the referendum on joining the 27-member bloc as the
cornerstone of her policies.</p>
<p>The fake Meta accounts posted criticism of Sandu, pro-EU politicians
and close ties between Moldova and Romania, and supported pro-Russia
parties in Moldova, the company said.</p>
<p>The company said its operation centered on about a dozen fictitious,
Russian-language news brands posing as independent entities with
presence on multiple internet services, including Meta-owned Facebook
and Instagram, as well as Telegram, OK.ru and TikTok.</p>
<p>Meta said it removed seven Facebook accounts, 23 pages, one group and
20 accounts on Instagram for violating its “coordinated inauthentic
behavior policy.”</p>
<p>About 4,200 accounts followed one or more of the 23 pages and about
335,000 accounts followed one or more of the Instagram accounts, Meta
said.</p>
<p>In Chisinau, the National Investigation Inspectorate said it had
blocked 15 channels of the popular Telegram messaging app and 95 chat
bots offering voters money. Users were told the channels “violated local
laws” on political party financing.</p>
<p>It had traced the accounts to supporters of fugitive businessman Ilan
Shor — members of the banned party bearing his name or the “Victory”
electoral bloc he had set up in its place from his base of exile in
Moscow.</p>
<p>Moldovan police said on Thursday that they searched homes of leaders
linked to Shor as part of a criminal investigation into
election-meddling. Police have said tens of thousands of voters were
paid off via accounts in a Russian bank to derail the vote.</p>
<p>Shor was sentenced to 15 years in jail in absentia last year in
connection with the 2014 disappearance of $1 billion from Moldovan
banks. He denies allegations of trying to bribe voters.</p>
<p>Sandu accuses Moscow of trying to topple her government while Moscow
has accused her of fomenting “Russophobia.”</p>

id="us-sues-virginia-over-alleged-violation-of-federal-election-law">US
sues Virginia over alleged violation of federal election law</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The U.S. Department of Justice said Friday that it had
sued the state of Virginia for violating the federal prohibition on
systematic efforts to remove voters within 90 days of an election.</p>
<p>On August 7, Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin signed an executive
order requiring the commissioner of the Department of Elections to
certify that the department was conducting “daily updates to the voter
list” to remove, among other groups, people who are unable to verify
that they are citizens to the Department of Motor Vehicles.</p>
<p>U.S. citizens who were identified and notified and did not affirm
their citizenship within 14 days would be removed from the list of
registered voters, the Justice Department said. It said this practice
has led to citizens having their voter registrations canceled ahead of
the November 5 election.</p>
<p>“By canceling voter registrations within 90 days of Election Day,
Virginia places qualified voters in jeopardy of being removed from the
rolls and creates the risk of confusion for the electorate,” said
Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke.</p>
<p>“Congress adopted the National Voter Registration Act’s quiet period
restriction to prevent error-prone, eleventh-hour efforts that all too
often disenfranchise qualified voters,” Clarke added.</p>
<p>The department said it was seeking injunctive relief that would
restore the ability of affected eligible voters to cast their votes
unimpeded on Election Day and would prohibit future violations.</p>
<p>Youngkin called the move politically motivated and an attempt to
interfere in the election.</p>
<p>“With the support of our attorney general, we will defend these
common sense steps that we are legally required to take with every
resource available to us,” he said in a statement on Friday.</p>
<p>Republicans across the U.S. have pushed against noncitizen voting,
which is already illegal, ahead of the November election. Some election
officials have warned that the move could penalize eligible voters.</p>

the 2024 presidential candidates compare on national debt</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-11, from: Market Place</p>
<p>
As Election Day grows closer, economic-minded voters wanna know: How
much do Harris and Trump plan on adding to the national debt? The
Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget reviewed the campaign
promises of both candidates and predicted a spending range for each. In
this episode, will Trump or Harris dig a deeper debt hole — and why
should voters care? Plus, thousands in North Carolina are still without
power, and why a mining company is paying billions for a lithium firm
when the metal’s prices are down.

id="experts-future-of-us-south-korea-defense-cost-sharing-deal-remains-uncertain">Experts:
Future of US-South Korea defense cost-sharing deal remains
uncertain</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — U.S. national security experts say it is unclear whether
a new cost-sharing agreement with South Korea, hailed by the State
Department as “a significant accomplishment,” will survive if former
President Donald Trump returns to the White House next year.</p>
<p>Concluded last week and effective from 2026, the five-year Special
Measures Agreement, or SMA, requires South Korea to raise its
contribution to the cost of stationing of U.S. troops in the country by
8.3% to $1.47 billion in the first year.</p>
<p>The two allies reached the agreement earlier than expected, a move
widely seen as key for Seoul and Washington to clinch before the U.S.
presidential election in November, in which Trump is the Republican
Party candidate.</p>
<p>The U.S. State Department hailed the agreement as a “a significant
accomplishment for both sides” in a statement released on October 4.</p>
<p>But Trump, both in office and as a candidate, has consistently
demanded that South Korea contribute significantly more to the cost of
supporting U.S. forces in Korea. Most recently in April, Trump told Time
magazine that “I want South Korea to treat us properly,” adding that
Seoul is “paying virtually nothing for” the U.S. troops stationed in
South Korea.</p>
<p>‘Trump factor’</p>
<p>John Bolton, a former White House national security adviser during
the Trump administration, told VOA Korean by phone on Friday that “it’s
very likely that Trump would ask to renegotiate it.”</p>
<p>“I know that the administration [of President Joe Biden] here tried
to rush the coming-to-an-agreement on it, so that Trump couldn’t meddle
with it, but that won’t slow him down at all,” said Bolton, who also
served as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations in 2005-06.</p>
<p>“He never thinks his predecessors make good enough deals, and in
part, it’s not just the question of economics, but he doesn’t understand
collective defense alliances,” Bolton said.</p>
<p>“He thinks that not just with respect to the Republic of Korea, but
also with NATO or Japan or whatever that we’re defending, these
countries don’t pay us enough money.” The Republic of Korea is South
Korea’s formal name.</p>
<p>Bruce Klingner, the senior research fellow for Northeast Asia at the
Heritage Foundation, pointed out the pact is “an executive agreement,”
which makes it easier for Trump to undo since it does not require
approval from Congress.</p>
<p>“We really don’t know whether he would just see it as a done deal, or
if he will seek to renegotiate it upward, where South Korea would pay
much more,” Klingner said.</p>
<p>“If you take a step back, it’s in our strategic interest to have
allies, it’s in our strategic interest to have our forces stationed
overseas, because actually, they’re less costly to the United States
when they’re stationed overseas than when they’re stationed
domestically.”</p>
<p>Robert Rapson, who served as charge d’affaires and deputy chief of
mission at the U.S. Embassy in Seoul from 2018 to 2021, told VOA Korean
last week that he was concerned that the agreement wouldn’t pass muster
with a Trump administration should the former president win a second
term in November.</p>
<p>“Given his demands and expectations of U.S. allies with respect to
security burden sharing, my strong fear is that he will seek to
renegotiate today’s agreement with a much higher number in mind,” said
Rapson, who was directly involved in the two sets of SMA negotiations in
2013-14 and in 2019-21.</p>
<p>Evans Revere, who served as acting U.S. assistant secretary of state
for East Asian and Pacific affairs, told VOA Korean on Thursday via
email that he suspected there was “considerable dissatisfaction with the
recently concluded SMA agreement in the Trump camp,” knowing how
strongly the former president feels about the burden-sharing issue.</p>
<p>Revere said he could not rule out the possibility that Trump will
come up with “a demand to reopen talks on the SMA issue, and toward that
end, he might make major new demands of Seoul” if he takes office
again.</p>
<p>‘It’s in our interest’</p>
<p>Other former government officials, like Klingner, believe it is too
early to predict whether Trump will try to revise the cost-sharing
agreement between the U.S. and South Korea.</p>
<p>Richard Armitage, who served as deputy secretary of state during the
George W. Bush administration, told VOA Korean on Wednesday on the
phone, “He might try, but let’s not get fearful about this too
soon.”</p>
<p>“If he comes to the White House, he will have a secretary of state,
defense, national security adviser, et cetera, who may have slightly
different views and can help moderate Mr. Trump.”</p>
<p>“Seoul and Washington understand that Trump is very transactional,”
Armitage said. “But American soldiers are not Hessians. We’re not for
rent. We’re in Korea because it’s in our interest.”</p>
<p>VOA Korean contacted the Trump campaign this week and asked what
Trump’s stance was on the newly reached agreement, but did not receive a
reply by the time this article was published.</p>
<p>Joeun Lee contributed to this report, which originated in VOA’s
Korean Service.</p>

soldier sentenced to 14 years in prison for trying to assist Islamic
State</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — A U.S. Army soldier was sentenced to 14 years in prison
for attempting to help the Islamic State conduct a deadly ambush of U.S.
troops, the Department of Justice said on Friday.</p>
<p>Cole Bridges, also known as Cole Gonzales, 24, will undergo
supervised release for 10 years following his release from prison, the
department said.</p>
<p>Bridges, who was a private first class at the time of his arrest, was
charged in 2021 with giving “military advice and guidance on how to kill
fellow soldiers to individuals he thought were part of ISIS,” the
department said.</p>
<p>Bridges pleaded guilty to terrorism charges in June 2023. He joined
the Army in 2019.</p>
<p>Before joining, according to the department, he began researching and
consuming online propaganda “promoting jihadists and their violent
ideology, and began to express his support for ISIS and jihad on social
media.”</p>

id="boeing-lawyers-argue-for-settlement-opposed-by-relatives-of-those-killed-in-737-max-crashes">Boeing
lawyers argue for settlement opposed by relatives of those killed in 737
Max crashes</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>fort worth, Texas — Relatives of passengers who died in two crashes
of Boeing 737 Max planes came to a federal court in Texas on Friday to
listen as their lawyers asked a judge to throw out a plea agreement that
the aircraft manufacturer struck with prosecutors and put the company on
trial.</p>
<p>Their lawyers argued that Boeing’s punishment — mainly a fine
amounting to about $244 million — would be too light for misleading
regulators about a flight-control system that malfunctioned before the
crashes. They accused Boeing and the Justice Department of airbrushing
facts and ignoring that 346 people died in the crashes.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor asked a Boeing lawyer why he should
accept the prepackaged plea deal and a sentence negotiated by a
defendant.</p>
<p>The Boeing lawyer, Ben Hatch, said Boeing “is a pillar of the
national economy and the national defense” and needs to know the
punishment before it agrees to plead guilty to conspiracy to commit
fraud, a felony. Otherwise, he said, the company could be disbarred from
federal contracting.</p>
<p>“All the employees of the company, the shareholders of the company
and a global and national supply chain … all of those are put into doubt
if the sentencing” isn’t known, possibly for months, Hatch said.</p>
<p>The answer stunned and angered relatives of the victims.</p>
<p>“Boeing is too important for the economy — they’re too big to jail.
That’s what he’s saying,” Michael Stumo, whose daughter Samya died in
the second crash, said after the hearing. “It allows them to kill people
with no consequences because they’re too big and because their
shareholders won’t like it.”</p>
<p>The government joined Boeing in asking the judge to accept the deal
that they struck in July.</p>
<p>Sean Tonolli, senior deputy chief of the Justice Department’s fraud
section, said the conspiracy count is the most serious crime prosecutors
can bring — they can’t prove that Boeing’s deception of regulators
caused the crashes. And, he said, going to trial is risky.</p>
<p>“We are confident in our case, but we don’t take for granted that we
might not win,” he said.</p>
<p>The judge, who had received written arguments from all sides before
the hearing in Fort Worth, asked questions but gave no indication if he
is leaning one way or the other. He has expressed sympathy for the
passengers’ families before, writing in a 2023 ruling about “Boeing’s
egregious criminal conduct.”</p>
<p>“You have given me a lot to think about,” O’Connor said to all the
lawyers as Friday’s hearing ended. “I’ll get a ruling out just as soon
as I can.”</p>
<p>In July, Boeing agreed to plead guilty to a single felony count of
conspiracy to commit fraud for allegedly deceiving Federal Aviation
Administration regulators who were writing pilot-training requirements
for the Max.</p>
<p>The FAA approved minimal, computer-based training for Boeing 737
pilots before they could fly the Max, the latest version of the 737.
That helped Boeing by avoiding the need for training in flight
simulators, which would have raised the cost for airlines to operate the
Max.</p>
<p>Airlines began flying the Max in 2017. The first crash occurred in
Indonesia in October 2018, followed in March 2019 by the second, in
Ethiopia.</p>
<p>The plea agreement calls for Boeing to pay a fine of up to $487.2
million, but the fine would be cut in half by giving the company credit
for $243.6 million it paid as part of a $2.5 billion settlement in 2021
to avoid prosecution. The Justice Department decided in May that Boeing
violated terms of that settlement, leading to the new plea deal.</p>
<p>Boeing, which is based in Arlington, Virginia, would also invest $455
million in compliance and safety programs, and be placed on probation
for three years.</p>
<p>The case is among a host of issues with which the manufacturer most
contend.</p>
<p>Talks broke down this week with striking factory workers who assemble
some of the company’s best-selling planes. The company withdrew its
offer and S&amp;P Global Ratings put it on its credit watch list, citing
increased financial risk because of the labor unrest.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the company filed a complaint over what it calls unfair
labor practices against the International Association of Machinists and
Aerospace Workers. Boeing in its complaint with the National Labor
Relations Board said that the union’s public narrative is misleading and
has made it difficult to reach a resolution.</p>

id="us-expands-sanctions-against-irans-oil-industry-after-attack-on-israel">US
expands sanctions against Iran’s oil industry after attack on
Israel</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The United States hit Iran’s oil and petrochemicals
sectors with fresh sanctions Friday in response to Tehran’s October 1
attack against Israel, designating dozens of new companies and firms.
 </p>
<p>In a statement Friday, the Treasury Department said it was going
after Iran’s so-called “shadow fleet” of ships involved in selling
Iranian oil in circumvention of existing sanctions, designating 10
companies and 17 vessels as “blocked property” over their involvement in
“shipments of Iranian petroleum and petrochemical products.” </p>
<p>The State Department announced it was sanctioning an additional six
firms and six ships for “knowingly engaging in a significant transaction
for the purchase, acquisition, sale, transport, or marketing of
petroleum or petroleum products from Iran.” </p>
<p>The sanctions form part of the U.S. response to Iran’s attack, in
which it launched some 200 ballistic missiles against Israel in
retaliation for the killing of Tehran-backed militant leaders and a
general from Iran’s Revolutionary Guards. </p>
<p>Israel has said its response to Iran’s second direct attack against
its territory this year would be “deadly, precise, and surprising.” </p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden told reporters last week that Israel should
consider “other alternatives than striking oil fields,” amid reports it
was planning to do so.  </p>
<p>“In response to Iran’s attack on Israel, the United States is taking
decisive action to further disrupt the Iranian regime’s ability to fund
and carry out its destabilizing activity,” Treasury Secretary Janet
Yellen said in a statement. </p>
<p>“Today’s sanctions target Iranian efforts to channel revenues from
its energy industry to finance deadly and disruptive activity —
including development of its nuclear program, the proliferation of
ballistic missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles,” she added.  </p>
<p>Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington had made clear
after the October 1 attack that Tehran would face consequences. </p>
<p>“To that end, we are taking steps today to disrupt the flow of
revenue the Iranian regime uses to fund its nuclear program and missile
development, support terrorist proxies and partners, and perpetuate
conflict throughout the Middle East,” he said in a statement.</p>

id="biden-again-blasts-disinformation-after-second-hurricane-batters-south">Biden
again blasts disinformation after second hurricane batters South</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WHITE HOUSE — During a briefing Friday on recovery efforts after
Hurricane Milton at the White House, U.S. President Joe Biden again
warned about the spread of “disgusting” and “dangerous” misinformation
and disinformation about the federal government’s response to recent
storms.</p>
<p>Responding to a reporter’s question, Biden said that misleading
information hurts people who need the most help. “Widowers, people in
hospitals, people who are by themselves and they don’t know, and they
lose contact, and they get scared to death,” he said.</p>
<p>“We’re breaking through with it. We’re breaking through with the
truth,” he said, noting that Republican governors and mayors have
supported his call to stop the spread of disinformation.</p>
<p>Former President Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee,
has been spreading disinformation about the government’s response,
including that the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, is
limiting payouts to disaster survivors to $750, and that funding for
Americans who are affected by the disaster was used up to provide
housing for undocumented immigrants.</p>
<p>“I think those who have been spreading these lies to try to undermine
the opposition are going to pay a price for it,” Biden said, adding that
Trump is not solely to blame but has the “biggest mouth.”</p>
<p>Biden provided an update on the federal government’s response to
hurricanes Milton and Helene flanked by his top aides, including
Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm and Secretary of Homeland Security
Alejandro Mayorkas. He was joined virtually by Vice President Kamala
Harris from her campaign stop in Arizona.</p>
<p>Harris again warned companies against taking advantage of the storms
to increase profit.</p>
<p>“Any company or individual that is using this crisis to jack up
prices through illegal fraud or price gouging, whether it be at the gas
pump, the airport or the hotel counter, we will be monitoring, and there
will be a consequence,” she said.</p>
<p>Milton deaths</p>
<p>Authorities in Florida said Friday that Hurricane Milton was
responsible for at least 16 deaths, and that more than 2 million people
remained without power as evacuees returned to their homes to assess the
damage and begin cleaning up from the storm.</p>
<p>As of midday Friday, the website poweroutage.us reported 2.3 million
people remained without power. Late Thursday, Biden said more than
50,000 line workers and 1,000 federal personnel were on the ground to
respond.</p>
<p>The storm made landfall late Wednesday near Siesta Key in Sarasota
County as a Category 3 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 205
kilometers per hour. It carved a path of destruction across central
Florida, affecting many communities still cleaning up from Hurricane
Helene two weeks earlier.</p>
<p>While the state’s western coast felt the direct hit from the storm,
Milton also spawned tornados that affected the southeastern part of the
state. Local media reported more than 19 tornadoes touched down even
before the hurricane made landfall. Tornadoes are believed responsible
for several deaths.</p>
<p>State government officials and the Florida National Guard reported
more than 1,000 people were rescued since the storm made landfall.</p>
<p>The U.S. Coast Guard reported one of its aircrews rescued a man
Wednesday clinging to a cooler floating in the Gulf of Mexico 48
kilometers off the Florida coast. It said the man was later taken to
Tampa General Hospital for medical treatment.</p>
<p>State officials said while total damage assessments are still being
made, the storm could have been much worse. The population center of
Tampa was spared a direct hit, and the predicted record-setting storm
surge did not materialize.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, scientists said climate change made Hurricane Milton
stronger and more dangerous.</p>
<p>In a report issued Friday, the nonprofit group Weather Attribution
said Milton went through an “explosive intensification” from a tropical
storm to a Category 5 hurricane in 24 hours.</p>
<p>The group said the rapid intensification was driven and sustained by
very high sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p>Some information for this report came from Reuters, The Associated
Press and Agence France-Presse.</p>

hurricanes reshape 2024 campaign’s final stretch</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — A pair of unwelcome and destructive guests named Helene
and Milton have stormed their way into this year’s U.S. presidential
election.</p>
<p>The back-to-back hurricanes have jumbled the schedules of Democrat
Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump, both of whom devoted part of
their recent days to tackling questions about the storm recovery
effort.</p>
<p>The two hurricanes are forcing basic questions about who as president
would best respond to deadly natural disasters, a once-overlooked issue
that has become an increasingly routine part of the job. And just weeks
before the November 5 election, the storms have disrupted the mechanics
of voting in several key counties.</p>
<p>Vice President Harris is trying to use this as an opportunity to
project leadership, appearing alongside President Joe Biden at briefings
and calling for bipartisan cooperation. Former President Trump is trying
to use the moment to attack the administration’s competence and question
whether it is withholding help from Republican areas, despite no
evidence of such behavior.</p>
<p>Adding to the pressure is the need to provide more money for the
Small Business Administration and the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, which would require House Republicans to work with the
Democratic administration. Biden said Thursday that lawmakers should
address the situation immediately.</p>
<p>Timothy Kneeland, a professor at Nazareth University in Rochester,
New York, who has studied the issue, said, “Dealing with back-to-back
crises will put FEMA under more scrutiny and, therefore, the Biden
administration will be under a microscope in the days leading up to the
election.</p>
<p>“Vice President Harris must empathize with the victims without
altering the campaign schedule and provide consistent messaging on the
widespread devastation that makes FEMA’s work even more challenging than
normal,” Kneeland said.</p>
<p>Already, Trump and Harris have separately gone to Georgia to assess
hurricane damage and pledge support, and Harris has visited North
Carolina, requiring the candidates to cancel campaign events elsewhere
and use up time that is a precious resource in the final weeks before
any election. Georgia and North Carolina are political battlegrounds,
raising the stakes.</p>
<p>Campaign language altered</p>
<p>The hurricane fallout is evident in the candidates’ campaign events
as well.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the first question Harris got at a Univision town hall
in Las Vegas came from a construction worker and undecided voter from
Tampa, Florida. Ramiro Gonzalez asked about talk that the administration
has not done enough to support people after Helene, and whether the
people in Milton’s path would have access to aid — a sign that Trump’s
messaging is breaking through with some potential voters.</p>
<p>Harris has called out the level of misinformation being circulated by
Republicans, but her fuller answer revealed the dynamics at play just a
few weeks before an election.</p>
<p>“I have to stress that this is not a time for people to play
politics,” she said.</p>
<p>On the same day, Trump opened his speech at the Detroit Economic Club
by praising Republican governors in the affected states and blasting the
Biden-Harris administration.</p>
<p>“They’ve let those people suffer unjustly,” he said about those
affected by Helene in North Carolina.</p>
<p>Voting systems affected</p>
<p>The storms have also scrambled the voting process in places. North
Carolina’s State Board of Elections has passed a resolution to help
people in the state’s affected counties vote. Florida will allow some
counties greater flexibility in distributing mail-in ballots and
changing polling sites for in-person voting. But a federal judge in
Georgia said Thursday the state doesn’t need to reopen voter
registration despite the disruptions by Helene.</p>
<p>Tension and controversy have begun to override the disaster response,
with Biden on Wednesday and Thursday saying that Trump has spread
falsehoods that are “un-American.”</p>
<p>Candace Bright Hall-Wurst, a sociology professor at East Tennessee
State University, said that natural disasters have become increasingly
politicized, often putting more of the focus on the politicians instead
of the people in need.</p>
<p>“Disasters are politicized when they have political value to the
candidate,” she said. “This does not mean that the politicization is
beneficial to victims.”</p>
<p>As the Democratic nominee, Harris has suddenly been a major part of
the response to hurricanes, a role that traditionally has not involved
vice presidents in prior administrations.</p>
<p>On Thursday, she participated virtually at a Situation Room briefing
on Milton while she was in Nevada for campaign activities. She has
huddled in meetings about response plans and on Wednesday phoned into
CNN live to discuss the administration’s efforts.</p>
<p>At a Wednesday appearance with Biden to discuss Milton ahead of it
making landfall, Harris subtly tied back the issues into her campaign
policies to stop price gouging on food and other products.</p>
<p>“To any company that — or individual that — might use this crisis to
exploit people who are desperate for help through illegal fraud or price
gouging — whether it be at the gas pump, the airport or the hotel
counter — know that we are monitoring these behaviors and the situation
on the ground very closely and anyone taking advantage of consumers will
be held accountable,” she said.</p>
<p>Harris warned that Milton “poses extreme danger.” It made landfall in
Florida late Wednesday and left more than 3 million without power. But
the storm surge never reached the same levels as Helene, which led to
roughly 230 fatalities and for a prolonged period left mountainous parts
of North Carolina without access to electricity, cell service and
roads.</p>
<p>Misinformation about Helene</p>
<p>Trump and his allies have seized on the aftermath of Helene to spread
misinformation about the administration’s response. Their debunked
claims include statements that victims can only receive $750 in aid, as
well as false charges that emergency response funds were diverted to
immigrants.</p>
<p>The former president said the administration’s response to Helene was
worse than the George W. Bush administration’s widely panned handling of
Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which led to nearly 1,400 deaths.</p>
<p>“This hurricane has been a bad one; Kamala Harris has left them
stranded,” Trump said at a recent rally in Juneau, Wisconsin. “This is
the worst response to a storm or a catastrophe or a hurricane that we’ve
ever seen ever. Probably worse than Katrina, and that’s hard to beat,
right?”</p>
<p>Asked about the Trump campaign’s strategic thinking on emphasizing
the hurricane response, campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt said
it reflects a pattern of “failed leadership” by the Biden administration
that also includes the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan and
security at the U.S. southern border.</p>
<p>John Gasper, a Carnegie Mellon University professor who has
researched government responses to natural disasters, said storm victims
generally want to ensure foremost that they get the aid they need.</p>
<p>“These disasters essentially end up being good tests of leadership
for local, state and federal officials in how they respond,” he
said.</p>
<p>But Gasper noted that U.S. politics have gotten so polarized and
other issues such as the economy are shaping the election, such that the
debate currently generating so much heat between Trump and the Biden
administration might not matter that much on Election Day.</p>

lawmakers seek answers from telecoms on Chinese hacking report</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers asked AT&amp;T,
Verizon Communications, and Lumen Technologies on Friday to answer
questions after a report that Chinese hackers accessed the networks of
U.S. broadband providers. </p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal reported Saturday hackers obtained
information from systems the federal government uses for
court-authorized wiretapping, and said the three companies were among
the telecoms whose networks were breached. </p>
<p>House Energy and Commerce Committee Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a
Republican, and the top Democrat on the committee Representative Frank
Pallone along with Representatives Bob Latta and Doris Matsui asked the
three companies to answer questions. They are seeking a briefing and
detailed answers by next Friday. </p>
<p>“There is a growing concern regarding the cybersecurity
vulnerabilities embedded in U.S. telecommunications networks,” the
lawmakers said. They are asking for details on what information was
seized and when the companies learned about the intrusion. </p>
<p>AT&amp;T and Lumen declined to comment, while Verizon did not
immediately comment. </p>
<p>It was unclear when the hack occurred. </p>
<p>Hackers might have held access for months to network infrastructure
used by the companies to cooperate with court-authorized U.S. requests
for communications data, the Journal said. It said the hackers had also
accessed other tranches of internet traffic. </p>
<p>China’s foreign ministry said on Sunday that it was not aware of the
attack described in the report but said the United States had “concocted
a false narrative” to “frame” China in the past.</p>

Stocks are increasingly an important source of household wealth. Thanks
to the booming stock market, U.S. household wealth surged to a record
high last year, per Federal Reserve data. But there are continued racial
differences in stock ownership, which has big implications for the
racial wealth gap. We’ll learn more. Also on the show: producer prices
remain tame, and business travel spending rebounds.

Later this morning, we’ll get the consumer price index for September.
While inflation is way down from its peak in June 2022, consumers are
frustrated with persistently high prices. We’ll hear more. Plus, how

As the Southeast assesses Hurricane Helene’s damage, Milton barrels
toward Florida’s west coast. The proximity of the storms will make it
harder for homeowners and insurers to estimate each one’s impact — and
likely drive up recovery costs. Also in this episode: Corporate bonds
shine after the Fed’s rate cut, the mortgage rate honeymoon is over and
Nebraska’s elections attract major campaign spending — along with some
odd yard signs.

Medicare does not pay for general, long-term care. Now, Kamala Harris,
the Democrat’s candidate for president, wants to expand Medicare to pay
for long-term care for older people in their home. That would need an
amenable new Congress, but many families are presently left trying to
piece together care for older relatives. Also on today’s show: potential
structure changes to Google and the rising value of the U.S. dollar.

monopoly when it comes to online searches. Plus, an agency enabling the

Natural disaster recovery is often expensive, but this season is shaping
up to be particularly costly and painful. The Southeast is reeling from
Hurricane Helene, and Hurricane Milton is expected to inflict more
damage starting tomorrow night. Disaster preparedness can reduce the
economic burden of recovery, but not all localities can afford to be
prepared. Also in this episode: The Fed’s interest rate cut raised
business owners’ optimism and China invites more young Americans to
visit.

<p>
Almost half of adults in the U.S. are single. But so many of our
economic policies and financial systems, from homeownership to
retirement planning, cater to couples. Today’s episode is an excerpt
from a Marketplace live show in Denver, hosted by “Make Me Smart”
co-host Kimberly Adams, on the economics of being single. Kimberly is
joined by a panel of experts who break down the financial challenges
(and perks) of living the single life, and the power of pushing back
against the societal pressures to pair up.

Microsoft finalized the largest video game deal ever: $68 billion for
Activision Blizzard.

Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, firms have taken some unprecedented
measures to balance out the effects of lockdown, inflation and supply
chain backups, leaving some economic predictors sorta … off. How can
forecasters do their jobs when so many economic patterns have changed?
Also in this episode: The Author’s Guild announces an anti-AI marketing
strategy, consumer credit climbs, and for some agents, the National
Association of Realtors settlement was the last straw.

worth $579 billion in 2000; today, it’s worth over $8 trillion. But is
there trouble ahead for private equity?

<h2 id="the-political-attacks-on-economic-data">The political attacks on
economic data</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-05, from: Market Place, Make me Smart</p>
<p>
The jobs report released today blew past economists’ forecasts,
estimating that employers added
<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/04/september-2024-us-jobs-report.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">about
250,000 jobs</a> to the U.S. economy in September. Republican Sen. Marco
Rubio is falsely claiming the jobs report is “fake.” We’ll get into how
big economic data is being politicized. And, what happens when October
surprises aren’t so surprising anymore? Plus, we’ll weigh in on “white
labeling” and flying taxis during a round of Half Full / Half Empty!
