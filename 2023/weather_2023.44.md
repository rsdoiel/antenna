## Tropical Storm Pilar Forecast Discussion Number 16

date: 2023-11-01, from: Eastern Pacific Basin Tropical Cyclones

<pre>

Tropical Storm Pilar Discussion Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP192023
1000 AM CDT Wed Nov 01 2023
 
Deep convection has continued to burst over the western portion of 
Pilar's circulation this morning.  However, the cloud tops have been 
warming during the past couple of hours, and recent visible imagery 
still indicates that the low-level circulation is located near the 
eastern edge of the convection.  The initial intensity is again held 
at 50 kt, which is a blend of the latest subjective Dvorak T- and 
CI-numbers from TAFB and SAB.
 
Recent satellite fixes show that Pilar is now moving westward or
270 degrees at 6 kt. A much faster westward to west-southwestward
motion is expected during the next few days as a narrow mid-level
ridge builds across southern Mexico.  The dynamical model guidance
continues to trend toward a faster solution, and the NHC track
forecast has again been sped up from the previous advisory.  The
new forecast track lies between the previous interpolated forecast
and the latest HCCA and TVCE consensus aids.
 
The moderate shear that has been plaguing Pilar is expected to
continue for another day or so.  Although the shear may decrease
somewhat after that time, the storm is likely to encounter a drier
and more stable airmass from an ongoing Gulf of Tehuantepec gap wind
event.  In addition, Pilar is expected to pass over an area of
slightly cooler upwelled waters to the south and southwest of the
Gulf of Tehuantepec.  As a result of these unfavorable conditions,
most of the dynamical model guidance shows gradual weakening
during the next few days, and the NHC intensity forecast follows
suit.  It should be noted that simulated satellite imagery from the
GFS suggests that Pilar could struggle to maintain organized deep
convection by the weekend.  The NHC forecast maintains Pilar as a
tropical cyclone for the entire 5-day period, but it is possible
that the system degenerates into a remnant low or trough before the
end of the period.  There is still a fair amount of uncertainty in 
the longer range status and intensity of the system.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Additional heavy rainfall from Pilar will produce flash and urban
flooding, along with mudslides in areas of higher terrain of the
Pacific coast of Central America from southern El Salvador, across
southern Honduras, western Nicaragua into northern Costa Rica
through today.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are possible along portions of the
Pacific coast of El Salvador where a Tropical Storm Watch remains
in effect.
 
3. Swells generated by Pilar will continue to affect the Pacific
coast of Central America during the next day or two.  These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.

Day 1 Convective Outlook

0648 AM CDT Wed Nov 01 2023

Valid 011300Z - 021200Z

...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
No overland thunderstorm areas are forecast today.

...Synopsis/Discussion...
In mid/upper levels, a longwave trough will persist over eastern
North America, though its amplitude will decrease somewhat, due to
the ejection/weakening of a strong shortwave trough now over Lake
Ontario and the central Appalachians.  Ridging aloft will prevail
over the Pacific Coast States, before a day-2 trough's moving
ashore.  Following a major low-level cold-frontal intrusion across 
the central/eastern CONUS and Gulf, and with a lack of moisture and
lift in the West as well, the air mass will be unfavorable for
thunderstorm areas across the CONUS.

## SPC Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0340 PM CDT Tue Oct 31 2023

Valid 021200Z - 081200Z

The mid/upper-level flow pattern over the CONUS is forecast to
become mostly zonal beginning Day 3/Thursday through much of the
extended forecast period as a weak ridge builds over portions of the
West. At the surface, a large area of high pressure across the
Southeast is forecast to gradually weaken from Day 3/Thursday into
the weekend. By late Day 4/Friday, developing surface cyclogenesis
to the lee of the Rockies is forecast to work in tandem with the
surface high across the Southeast to encourage the northward return
flow of moisture across the Plains (and eventually areas across the
Southeast). 

...Southern High Plains...
With mid-level zonal flow expected through most of the extended
forecast period, occasional gusty downslope winds are possible over
parts of eastern New Mexico and the southern High Plains. Despite
the increase in winds, a cold air mass and recent precipitation
suggest fuels are not overly receptive to fire spread. Thus, while
periods of localized dry and windy conditions are possible through
early next week, the threat for widespread Critical fire weather
conditions is low.

...Southern California...
Lingering weak offshore flow is likely to persist across portions of
southern California into this weekend. While wind speeds aren't
forecast to be very strong, at least occasional periods of gusty
winds amidst very dry air and increasingly receptive fuels may
support periodic locally elevated fire weather conditions -
especially in typically favored mountain and valley areas.

...Southeast...
A very dry air mass is forecast to remain across portions of the
Southeast Day 3/Thursday as the aforementioned surface high pressure
settles into the area. Although fuels are forecast to remain
critically receptive, sustained surface winds speeds are forecast to
be lighter (near 5 mph) than previous days which should keep
widespread Critical fire weather concerns low.

## Tropical Storm Pilar Forecast Discussion Number 13

date: 2023-10-31, from: Eastern Pacific Basin Tropical Cyclones

<pre>

WTPZ44 KNHC 312035
TCDEP4
 
Tropical Storm Pilar Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP192023
400 PM CDT Tue Oct 31 2023
 
Satellite imagery shows that Pilar's center remains exposed on the 
southeast side of the main convective plume. Earlier AMSR2 and 
SSMI/S microwave imagery depicts some partial banding features 
within the northern semi-circle. Scatterometer ASCAT-B and -C passes 
this afternoon shows satellite derived winds are around 40 to 45 
knots. These values are in good agreement with the latest Dvorak 
satellite intensity estimates from both TAFB and SAB, T/3.0 or 45 
knots. Therefore, given the combination of data this the 
initial intensity remains at 45 kt for this advisory.
 
Pilar is moving slowly east-northeastward or 060/3 kt. The storm is 
forecast to move very little tonight as the steering currents over 
the far eastern Pacific collapse. A mid-level ridge is then forecast 
to build to the north and northeast of Pilar, which should cause the 
storm to begin moving west-southwestward. As the mid-level ridge 
continues to build westward, Pilar will be steered on a 
west-southwestward to westward motion along the southern side of the 
ridge. The latest NHC track forecast is similar to the previous 
advisory and lies near the latest consensus aids. The threat of 
tropical-storm-force winds should begin to diminish as Pilar starts 
moving westward, but the risk of heavy rain and flash-flooding is 
expected to continue over portions of Central America over the next 
couple of days.
 
Some slight strengthening is possible during the next day or so as 
the storm is located over warm sea surface temperatures and moderate 
vertical wind shear. In about 2 to 3 days vertical wind shear is 
forecast to weaken, but dry air from a gap wind event from the Gulf 
of Tehuantepec may limit intensification.  Towards the end of the 
period, the environmental conditions may become a little more 
conducive and the official forecast depicts strengthening once 
again. The NHC intensity forecast lies near the corrected HCCA 
consensus aids.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rains from Pilar will produce flash and urban flooding, 
along with mudslides in areas of higher terrain of the Pacific coast 
of Central America from southern El Salvador, across southern 
Honduras, western Nicaragua into northern Costa Rica through 
Wednesday.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are possible along portions of the
Pacific coast of El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua, where a
Tropical Storm Watch remains in effect.
 
3. Swells generated by Pilar will continue to affect the Pacific
coast of Central America during the next few days.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0234 PM CDT Tue Oct 31 2023

Valid 312000Z - 011200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated thunderstorms are possible over parts of the Great Lakes
and immediate vicinity, as well as off the southeastern Florida
coast.

...20Z Update...
No changes have been made. See the previous discussion below for
more information.

..Dean.. 10/31/2023

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1103 AM CDT Tue Oct 31 2023/

...Synopsis...
Thunderstorm potential today is expected to remain largely over the
Great Lakes and off the southeastern Florida Coast. A compact upper
low is evident in mid-morning satellite imagery over southern
WI/northern IL. This feature is expected to begin tracking to the
east over the next 12 hours in tandem with the mean upper trough. 12
UTC soundings across the Midwest and Great Lakes sampled very cold
temperatures aloft associated with this feature (500 mb temperatures
between -30 to -40 C), which will overspread the warmer waters of
the Great Lakes through the afternoon and evening. While buoyancy
will be minimal, lapse rates should be sufficiently steep to support
occasional lightning flashes over the Lakes and along the lake
shores. Isolated thunderstorms are also possible along a residual
boundary off the southeastern FL coast; however, convection should
remain offshore.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0227 PM CDT Tue Oct 31 2023

Valid 011200Z - 021200Z

Elevated to locally critical fire weather conditions remain likely
for several hours tomorrow afternoon along portions of the Gulf
Coast in a cool, but very dry, post-frontal regime where RH values
near 20% (locally lower), temperatures in the mid/upper 50s,
sustained northerly surface winds of 10-15+ mph, and critically
receptive fuels (owing to ongoing Moderate to Exceptional drought)
are expected. Primary change with this forecast update was to expand
the Elevated fire weather area slightly in all directions based on
the latest ensemble guidance and fuel information. 

Elevated fire weather conditions may also extend farther northward
into portions of Georgia where very low RH values (15-25%) are
expected amidst receptive fuels. Though, the latest ensemble
forecasts keep sustained winds generally around 10 mph, which
precludes the expansion of the Elevated area into this region at
this time.

Locally Elevated fire weather conditions are possible for a few
hours tomorrow afternoon across portions of South/North Carolina,
where RH values of 25-30% will occur in conjunction with sustained
winds of 10-15 mph and at least modestly receptive fuels. At this
time, the forecast overlap of lowered minimum RH values and stronger
surface winds appears too brief/spotty to introduce an Elevated
area.

..Elliott.. 10/31/2023

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0116 AM CDT Tue Oct 31 2023/

...Synopsis...
A surface anticyclone will track toward the East Coast as a
mid-level trough ejects in the Atlantic tomorrow/Wednesday.
North-northeasterly surface flow to the south of the anticyclone
will promote dry, breezy conditions along portions of the Gulf
Coast, which is experiencing a severe to extreme drought. As such,
locally stressed vegetation may support some wildfire-spread
potential amid 20-30 percent RH and 10+ mph sustained northerly
surface winds, warranting the introduction of Elevated highlights.
Elevated meteorological surface conditions may also develop across
portions of northeast New Mexico into the northern Texas Panhandle.
However, fuels appear marginal at best for wildfire-spread
potential, with fire weather highlights withheld for now.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 PM CDT (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Pilar was
located near latitude 11.6 North, longitude 90.9 West.  Pilar is
moving toward the east-northeast near 5 mph (7 km/h) and this motion
is expected to continue through early Wednesday.  On the forecast
track, Pilar could be near the coast of El Salvador or Nicaragua
Tuesday through early Wednesday, though the core of the system is
expected to remain offshore.  The storm is forecast to move
west-southwestward away from land on Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Further strengthening is expected during the next day or so,
and Pilar could be near hurricane strength on Tuesday.  Weakening is
expected to begin on Wednesday and continue through Thursday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Pilar can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO header WTPZ44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP4.shtml
 
RAINFALL: Pilar is expected to produce storm total rainfall of 5 to
10 inches, with local amounts to 15 inches, over portions of Central
America from El Salvador southward to Costa Rica through Wednesday.
This rainfall will produce flash and urban flooding, along with
mudslides in areas of higher terrain.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Pilar are expected to continue affecting
the Pacific coast of Central America during the next few days. These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions could begin in the Tropical
Storm Watch area early Tuesday.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

## Tropical Storm Pilar Forecast Discussion Number 9

Tropical Storm Pilar Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP192023
400 PM CDT Mon Oct 30 2023
 
Pilar seems to have held somewhat steady this afternoon.  1-minute 
geostationary satellite visible imagery shows the low-level 
circulation beginning to be exposed just east of the deep convection 
as the central deep overcast gradually clears.  Recent microwave 
imagery revealed a decent curved band wrapping around the western 
and northern portions of the core.  Subjective and objective 
satellite intensity estimates range from 39-51 kt and the initial 
intensity is held at 45 kt, closest to the SAB T3.0/45 kt value.
 
The storm continues to move slowly east-northeastward.  Models 
generally agree on this motion, which should continue for the next 
day or so.  By Tuesday evening, Pilar is forecast to stall near the 
coast of El Salvador with the core of the storm offshore.  By 
Wednesday the storm is expected to turn west-southwestward, away 
from the coastline, in the flow of a building ridge over the western 
Caribbean and Central America.  The latest NHC track forecast is 
shifted slightly north of the previous prediction, largely due to 
the northward shift in the initial position.
 
Moderate east-southeasterly shear appears to be affecting Pilar.  
However, most of the model guidance indicates that the storm should 
steadily strengthen for the next day or so over the warm waters and 
in a moist airmass.  After 36 h, the deep-layer shear should 
increase which will likely induce a weakening trend. By days 3-5, 
the shear is expected to abate somewhat.  Once again, the long-range 
official intensity forecast has been increased slightly and is close 
to the various consensus aids.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rains from Pilar will produce flash and urban flooding,
along with mudslides in areas of higher terrain, near the Pacific
coast of Central America from El Salvador southward to Costa Rica
through Wednesday.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are possible beginning early Tuesday
along portions of the Pacific coast of El Salvador, Honduras, and
Nicaragua, where a Tropical Storm Watch remains in effect. Interests
elsewhere along the Pacific coast of Guatemala, and Nicaragua should
monitor the progress of this system as additional watches or
warnings could be needed later tonight.
 
3. Swells generated by Pilar will continue to affect the Pacific
coast of Central America during the next few days.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
