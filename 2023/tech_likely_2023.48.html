id="microsoft-soliciting-feedback-about-an-windows-advanced-settings-panel">Microsoft
soliciting feedback about an “Windows Advanced Settings” panel</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-01, from: OS News</p>
<p>Currently, there are many settings/registry keys that developers
desire to tweak that are either not accessible via the Windows Settings
app and/or are difficult to discover throughout the OS. Users may have
to resort to running scripts or manually changing registry keys to get
their machine into their ideal state. Furthermore, there is not a single
place for developers to discover and tweak new Windows features specific
to developer workflows that are in development and provide feedback on
them. This means that developers may not even be aware of features or
settings that they can tweak to improve their workflows and optimize
their productivity/machine performance. Finally, lots of developers have
to search the web to find the best settings to tweak to optimize their
machine for their specific use case — there isn’t a single place to find
what settings are recommended by fellow developers. Microsoft is
soliciting feedback on a possible new settings panel that would
centralise popular advanced settings in Windows that currently require
registry hacks or are otherwise difficult to find. The company wants to
know which features and settings are a good fit for such a panel, and
what such a panel should look like. This is an excellent idea, and
something I’m sure many of the Windows users here would love to see.</p>

practical set of principles to guide space exploration cooperation among
nations, including those participating in NASA’s Artemis program. NASA,

researchers’ attack prompts ChatGPT to reveal its training data</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-01, from: OS News</p>
<p>A team of researchers primarily from Google’s DeepMind systematically
convinced ChatGPT to reveal snippets of the data it was trained on using
a new type of attack prompt which asked a production model of the
chatbot to repeat specific words forever.  Using this tactic, the
researchers showed that there are large amounts of privately
identifiable information (PII) in OpenAI’s large language models. They
also showed that, on a public version of ChatGPT, the chatbot spit out
large passages of text scraped verbatim from other places on the
internet. So not only are these things cases of mass copyright
infringement, they also violate countless privacy laws. Cool.</p>

<h2 id="my-long-quest-to-revive-a-90s-windows-gaming-cult-classic">My
long quest to revive a ’90s Windows gaming cult classic</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-01, from: OS News</p>
<p>As 2023 draws to a close—and as we start to finalize our Game of the
Year contenders—I really should be catching up on the embarrassingly
long list of great recent releases that I haven’t put enough time into
this year. Instead, over the last few days, I’ve found myself once again
hooked on a simple, addictive, and utterly unique Japanese Windows
freeware game from the late ’90s that, until recently, I thought I had
lost forever. Pendulumania is a cult classic in the truest sense of the
word: Few people have heard of it, even in hardcore gaming circles, but
those who have experienced it tend to have very fond memories of it. And
while I shared those memories, it wasn’t until this week that I’ve been
able to share my effusive praise for a game whose name and playable
executable had eluded me for well over a decade. What a great story.</p>

</p>
<p>
But every time I’ve posted a video, blog post, tweet (<em>xeet?</em>),
or anything else on the topic of Pi clusters, a common sentiment is “you
can do that faster and cheaper with a set of VMs.”
</p>
<p>
Or, during the Pi shortage (which is
<a href="https://rpilocator.com">basically over</a>), when you could
only buy Pis from scalpers for insane markups, the sentiment was “you
can do that faster and for the same price with a bunch of used mini
PCs.”
</p>
<p>
Luckily, with Compute Modules coming back into general availability at
MSRP, and Pi 4s being available at most local retailers as well (at
least here in the US?), building hobby clusters of 3, 4, or 6 Raspberry
Pis is achievable again, for a few hundred bucks, all-in.

It fell off the air when Twitter blew up their API. I keep wanting it
back, because I keep watching shows that should be in its database. I
miss it. Then I realized it’s not that different from the
<a href="https://defaults.rknight.me/">group of explorers</a> who are
putting their app choices into feeds. The Bingeworthy database is
people, shows and ratings. The simplest relational database possible. It
would be easy to represent each user as a feed, where each item is a
rating. The link for each item would be a pointer to the Metacritic
page. And then give each feed a category of <i>bingeworthy. </i>From
there, we explore. BTW, this is the

Rare earth metals are essential for our modern life, whether in EV
motors, cell phones, or in electronics in general. Mining these metals
is notoriously difficult and dirty. How might a Solarpunk future address
this issue? How might we get there from where we are today? Through this

</p>
<hr />
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Let's start from the basics: can you introduce
yourself?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
My name is Nicolas Magand, and I was born in Saint-Étienne, France. At
first, I wasn’t very interested in the web. I preferred playing video
games and watching football on TV. I was studying sustainable
development and biology at university. However, once I got my first
computer at the age of 20, around 2004 when I was living abroad in
Scotland, I discovered a new passion for technology: Twitter, iPods,
software, blogs, computers, BlackBerry phones, podcasts, and so on. This
hobby eventually led me to a career, and I ended up working in content
marketing for companies like Microsoft and Xiaomi. I spent most of the
2010s in Paris, but the pandemic and my current employer (PrestaShop)
allowed me in 2020 to work remotely from the beautiful city of
Strasbourg, which is where I happily live now.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>What's the story behind your blog?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
The blog in its current form is ten years old, more or less. I had
numerous versions of it before, on (many) different platforms, and other
blogs before it. I think I started blogging on Windows Live Spaces, back
in 2005, then Blogger, I think. I then switched from writing in French
to English (the de facto language of the web, especially in my interest
circles), and ended up using Posterous, Tumblr, and Squarespace. I used
to share all the things I found interesting online and rant about
different topics. Unfortunately, this blogging habit ended up being
replaced by Twitter itself, and if you look at my archives, you’ll see
huge time gaps between some articles: blogging felt redundant at times,
and tweets were so much easier to write.
</p>
<p>
Once I finally managed to post more regularly, I felt that my blog
needed its own name and identity, instead of just being “my name dot
com.” The name The Jolly Teapot is loosely inspired by a
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/picture/2019/nov/08/tom-gauld-on-fake-his-dark-materials-books-cartoon" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">comic
strip from the excellent Tom Gauld</a>, and I found that it had a nice
“early 2000s” vibe.
</p>
<p>
The past couple of years were mostly focused on working on its barebones
design, during which I learned a lot about CSS and HTML. It also served
as a way for me to procrastinate any form of writing, which sometimes
feels too much like my day job.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>What does your creative process look like when it comes to
blogging?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I want to say that three quarters of my blog posts come from reading an
article I just read on a topic that I’m familiar with, on which I feel I
have something of value to add. I read a column or a blog post, and I
want to add something, comment, criticise, rant, approve, etc. These are
the cherished moments where I realise that blogging is part of my web
habits, and part of me. Without this blogging action, my experience of
the web would feel incomplete.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe
the physical space influences your creativity?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I love to read and write very early in the morning when it’s quiet and
dark. I just need my MacBook Air on my lap and a fresh cup of coffee. In
the evening my brain is too foggy to write anything interesting. What I
like to do is edit a draft on a different day than I wrote it: I find
that it improves the process quite a lot, even if it means publishing a
day or two later (my posts need a lot of editing).
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your
tech stack?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
My blog uses Blot as a CMS, which is absolutely fantastic and I couldn’t
think of something better for me: I just use my text editor app of
choice, and everything happens in the background via Dropbox, it’s
really great. My domain is registered on Cloudflare, where I have set up
a CDN for the blog to gain a few precious milliseconds of loading time,
which is both unnecessary and essential. I am currently trying to fit AI
into my workflow, and so far it can be pretty great for editing, which
is something at which I am really bad and hate doing. I’m less convinced
by transcription: I thought I could save a lot of time by dictating my
thoughts instead of typing them, but I quickly realised that typing is
what makes my thoughts work. Without writing my thoughts are just all
over the place and the transcripts are barely usable.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would
you do anything differently?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
If I were to start today, I would like to think that I’d use the exact
same tech stack and the same name. What I would definitely do
differently, though, is better define the topics I would write about
from the start. I think consistency is key in maintaining a good
publishing pace, and I also think readers like to know what they can
expect from a specific blogger. If I were to start today, I’d either
stick to one, two, or three specific topics and formats. I think these
artificial boundaries would have helped me find a voice sooner and
publish more posts.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Financial question since the web is obsessed with money: how
much does it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost or does it
generate some revenue? And what's your position on people monetising
personal blogs?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
Between Cloudflare, the domain name, and Blot, I think I spend around
100 euros per year for my blog, which is quite cheap considering the
amount of joy it’s giving me: after publishing an article I’m happy
with, I feel like a million bucks as the Americans would say. I would
definitely not consider this a cost, but an investment in myself.
</p>
<p>
If one has the opportunity to earn some money with their blog, I think
it’s fantastic, as long as it doesn’t ruin the website, or the content
itself. If I could make a living blogging, I would. I am happy to
support a few bloggers, either through subscriptions, or through
one-time contributions.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth
checking out? And also, who do you think I should be interviewing
next?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I have so many names in mind, but right now I’m thinking of
<a href="https://winnielim.org" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Winnie
Lim</a>, always great to read and her blog feels like the essence of
blogging, just like
<a href="https://maggieappleton.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Maggie
Appleton</a>. Another name I have in mind is
<a href="https://robinrendle.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Robin
Rendle</a>
(<em><a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/pb-robin-rendle">Robin's P&amp;B
interview is available here</a></em>). Robin’s blog has one of the best
designs around, even if it changes often. Then there’s
<a href="https://meanwhile.substack.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Daniel
Gray's Meanwhile</a>, which isn’t really a “blog” but could be. Also,
<a href="https://kevquirk.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Kev
Quirk</a> (<em><a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/pb-kev-quirk">Kev's
P&amp;B interview is available here</a></em>) and
<a href="https://bt.ht" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Bradley
Taunt</a>, who surely have something very interesting to say about
blogging.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Final question: is there anything you want to share with
us?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
If I were still on social media, I would probably share most of the
entries from
<a href="https://www.theonion.com/opinion/american-voices" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">The

<h2 id="first-bits-of-a-haiku-compatibility-layer-for-netbsd">First bits
of a Haiku compatibility layer for NetBSD</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-01, from: OS News</p>
<p>Does anyone here remember Cosmoe? Cosmoe was an attempt to combine
Haiku’s API with the Linux kernel and related tools, started in the
early 2000s. The project eventually fizzled out, now only an obscure
footnote for BeOS diehards such as myself. It seems, though, that the
idea of combining the Haiku API with a mature UNIX-like operating system
refuses to die, and a few days ago, on the NetBSD Users’s Discussion
List, a developer by the name of Stephan picked up the baton. Some years
ago I already started to work on a compatibility layer for NetBSD and
resumed working on it recently. I think a compatibility layer would
mostly consist of kernel components and a custom libroot.so. I have
created a libroot that provides functionality missing in libc and it
should behave like the original one. It makes use of libc and libpthread
at the moment as well as syscalls of the kernel components. The source
can be found on Github. This is clearly an experimental project, but
Stephan does note he has had success running the Haiku IPC test
programs, so it’s definitely more than scribbles on a napkin. The
attraction of this idea is clear, too – Haiku API, but on a stable
kernel with vastly superior hardware and device support. I’m not
entirely sure if it’s got life in it, but even if it doesn’t – it’s
amazing work, and that in an of itself makes it a success.</p>

<h2 id="cinnamon-6.0-arrives-with-initial-wayland-support">Cinnamon 6.0
arrives with initial Wayland support</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-01, from: OS News</p>
<p>Cinnamon, the desktop environment mostly associated with Linux Mint,
has released its sixth version. It also adds support for AVIF images, a
new option for notification screen selection, a new gesture for desktop
zoom, a new menu details option, color picker support in the screenshot
service, and an xdg-portal configuration file. Various improvements are
present as well to fix missing thumbnails for windows that are created
while the Menu applet is open, enable window resizing in the Cinnamon
Menu Editor, fix a bug causing the Menu applet to be partly behind the
panel, fix the Power applet’s battery status, fix reloading of desklets
after an update when multiple instances are running, and ensure the
Settings window fits the toolbar when expanded. Cinnamon 6.0’s biggest
new feature is an experimental Wayland session, marking the first steps
towards fully supporting Wayland in the near future.</p>

A year after Low-tech Magazine built and documented
<a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2022/03/how-to-build-a-practical-household-bike-generator/">a
domestic bicycle generator</a>, the <em>Pavillon d’Arsenal</em> in Paris
asked if they could borrow it for an exhibition. We agreed to build a
new one instead. The result of our work is now part of
<a href="https://www.pavillon-arsenal.com/fr/expositions/12805-energies-legeres.html">the
exhibition “Énergies légères”</a>, which runs until March 2024. The
installation gives visitors an idea of how much energy they can produce
as humans.

are based on spinning bikes and are more powerful than the first bike
generator we built.

<h2 id="efficient-elt-refreshes">Efficient ELT refreshes</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-01, from: Max Halford Blog</p>
<p>A tenant of the modern data stack is the use of ELT (Extract, Load,
Transform) over ETL (Extract, Transform, Load). In a nutshell, this
means that most of the data transformation is done in the data
warehouse. This has become the de facto standard for modern data teams,
and is epitomized by dbt and its ecosystem. It’s a great time to be a
data engineer! We at Carbonfact fully embrace the ELT paradigm.</p>

<p>
Remember Viv’s Move-ember challenge? So, even though Viv led the office
for the entire month up to the final hour, and even though he averaged
23,000 steps per day over the 30 days and did <strong>50,000
steps</strong> yesterday, he got pipped at the final hurdle by the
person who had been in no. 2 position. Apparently she did a 4½ hour
session on the exercise bike, finishing right at midnight 😂
</p>
<p>
In addition, even though technically the Victorian office beat the NSW
one, in my opinion they cheated because the NSW office had way more
average steps per person and the Vic office only won because it’s
larger. Believe me, as a born-and-raised Victorian this brings me no
pleasure to say.

Huawei made a cutting-edge chip in China and surprised the US</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-30, from: OS News</p>
<p>This ambition to escape dependence on foreign technology rests on the
shoulders of Huawei and SMIC. The successful launch of the Kirin 9000S
injected new vigor into the semiconductor industry, with executives
reporting that chip start-ups are seeing a surge in funding. But
Huawei’s long-term ambitions are not limited to the markets in China’s
orbit. The original nickname for the Kirin 9000S—Charlotte—is a symbol
of these hopes. It was named not for an individual, but for the city in
North Carolina. Other mobile semiconductors in development are also
named internally for US cities, insiders say. Using American names, says
one Huawei employee, reflects “our desire to one day reclaim our place
in the global supply chain.” It’s amazing how without any official
support and using cobbled-together outdated lithography machines, Huawei
and SMIC have managed to make a reasonably competitive smartphone SoC.
As I keep saying – Chinese chip makers have the full financial might of
the Chinese state behind them, and they’ll stop at nothing to reduce
their dependence on ASML, TSMC, Intel, AMD, and so on. And they’re
making progress.</p>

<h2 id="new-scripting-news-home-page">New Scripting News home page</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-30, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
It’s been five years since I re-did the Scripting News home page. It was
overdue. The new version isn’t all that different on the surface from
the previous version, here’s a list of things to look at.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Blog, the first tab, becomes
<a href="http://scripting.com/?tab=dave">Dave</a>.
</li>
<li>
The News tab now is named
<a href="http://scripting.com/?tab=bloggers">Bloggers</a> and it does
something different, more on that in a bit.
</li>
<li>
The tabs work better, the pages aren’t reloaded when you click on one of
the tabs, but the URL in your browser’s address bar changes, so you can
bookmark it and go directly to the page you’re interested in. And the
browser Back button works as you would expect.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The big change under the covers is that it hooks into
<a href="https://feedland.org/">FeedLand</a> on its own. When you’re
reading the <a href="http://scripting.com/?tab=bloggers">Bloggers
tab</a>, you’re reading content that came directly from the new
Automattic-hosted FeedLand server.
</p>
<p>
The
<a href="https://feedland.com/opml?screenname=davewiner&catname=bloggers">list
of feeds</a> behind the Bloggers tab right now are just placeholders.
We’re going to work with other sources, using reading lists, to create a
news flow from blogs that we think are interesting, along with what
other people think are interesting. How this will develop is not yet
clear, but we are going to work on this. When I say “we,” I mean
<a href="https://cagrimmett.com/">Chuck Grimmett</a> and myself and
others at Automattic. This is the kind of stuff they do for WordPress
users, so it fits right in imho with our respective skills.
</p>
<p>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/11/30/goodhumortruck.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Speaking
for myself, I want to engage with more bloggers. We used to have
something, and I think we can again.
</p>
<p>
We’re putting a lot of development behind this. FeedLand has been in
development for almost three freaking years. This last year has been
spent turning corners, and building out features so they can scale to
Automattic-level flow. And adding one major new kickass feature to the
world of feeds – reading lists. The ability to subscribe to lists of
feeds. We’re going to use that in a lot of places. I wanted to get that
in the product before we started using it. And it’s in, and it works.
There are still a few glitches to work out, you know – software can
always work better than it does. <span
class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>
</p>
<p>
All I can say is we’re getting there. Today’s FeedLand does a lot more
and works a lot better than last year’s.
</p>
<p>
And now Scripting News is part of that. So we’ll be able to make the new
stuff more visible, by using it here in this site.
</p>
<p>
<i>Still diggin!</i>
</p>
<p>
As they say.

<h2 id="this-month-in-servo-better-floats-has-color-mix-and-more">This
month in Servo: better floats, :has(), color-mix(), and more!</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-30, from: OS News</p>
<p>Our nightly example browser, servoshell, is now easier to navigate,
accepting URLs without http:// or https:// both in the location bar and
on the command line, and should no longer lock up when run with
–no-minibrowser. Local paths can also be given on the command line, and
are still preferred when the path points to a file that exists. Work is
now underway to improve our embedding story and prepare Servo for
integration with Tauri, starting with precompiled ANGLE for faster
initial builds, better support for offscreen rendering, and support for
multiple webviews. These changes haven’t landed yet, but once they do,
apps will be able to open, move, resize, and interleave Servo with other
widgets. I’m curious what the future will bring to Servo. It seems under
very active development, but it’s not part of any of the main browser
projects. Let’s hope they can keep up the momentum so that it can grow
into a viable alternative. Because lord do we need one.</p>

<h2 id="evaluating-m3-pro-cpu-cores-general-performance">Evaluating M3
Pro CPU cores: general performance</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-30, from: OS News</p>
<p>Evaluating the performance of CPUs with identical cores is relatively
straightforward, and they’re easy to compare using single- and
multi-core benchmarks. When there are two different types of core, one
designed primarily for energy efficiency (E), the other for maximum
performance (P), traditional benchmarks can readily mislead. Multi-core
results are dominated by the ratio of P to E cores, and variable
frequency confounds further. In this series of articles, I set out to
disentangle these when comparing core performance between Apple’s
original M1 Pro and its third-generation M3 Pro chips. This first
article explains why and how I am investigating this, and shows overall
results for performance and power use under a range of loads. Articles
like these will help you make an informed decision about whether or not
your workloads can benefit from moving from an M1/M2 to an M3.</p>

<h2 id="my-2023-spotify-wrapped">My 2023 Spotify Wrapped</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-30, from: Jessica Smith’s blog</p>
<p>
OK, I bothered opening up Spotify on my phone to check out my actual
Wrapped. Fun discoveries:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
“Permanent wave” is apparently a genre that exists. And it’s my 3rd most
listened to this year.
</li>
<li>
Apparently the city whose music taste most closely resembles mine is
Perth 😆
</li>
<li>
I am in the top 0.1% of The Twilight Sad listeneners 👑
</li>
<li>
Placebo/their management <abbr title="Couldn't Be Fucked">CBF</abbr>
uploading a proper “artist message” but didn’t <em>just not</em> either,
so they uploaded a soundless compilation of clips from their concerts
</li>
<li>
Spotify labelled my listening pattern as “Hypnotist” because I “like to
play albums the whole way through”
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Because I use Last.fm there were no surprises with regard to my top
artists or anything. I think my favourite feature was the artist
messages, at least the ones who seemed earnest and not totally phoning
it in. I was excited Alexandra Savior said she had new music coming
“very, very soon”, because the other day I read a 2021 interview with
her where she said much the same thing and was like, “…where did it go?”
</p>
<p>
I guess next year should be back to my Spotify Wrapped being a bit more
surprising (read: not identical to my Last.fm stats) because I’m trying
to go back to cultivating my own music collection and listening to it
via Plexamp (but still using Spotify somewhat for breadth and
discovery). That’ll be a fun journey.

<p>
So I’m doing the “let the Spotify DJ walk you through your 2023 Wrapped”
thing, and the very first song was… Interpol’s “Leif Erikson”, which I
think I would’ve listened to exactly two times all year (when I listened
to the whole album) if Spotify didn’t insist on cramming it into every
single “songs it goes on to when an album finishes” set.
</p>
<p>
Also, so far, every other one of my “top songs” this year has been by
Interpol too. But maybe that’s just the DJ organising my “top songs” by
artist or something. Interpol still isn’t exactly where I’d have
started, though (they rank 7th for my year up to 15 Nov, according to
Last.fm).

For comic relief, I asked my friend ChatGPT, to draw a rendering of my
new design, based on these instructions.
</p>
<p>
<i>i want you to draw me a picture of the user interface of my blog,
scripting news, as i describe it here. there are four tabs: blog, links,
bloggers and about. below the tabs is a display area, where the content
of the selected tab is displayed. above the tabs, across the whole width
of the window is an artistic picture, with the big letters SCRIPTING
NEWS overlaying it. Just below is the site slogan, “it’s even worse than
it appears.” In your drawing the picture behind the letters should be of
a hippie band playing in golden gate park. have fun!</i>

heard ActivityPub described as

RSS</a>. If so, there are imho more direct ways to arrive at that. I
think it’s possible to create a federation system that takes a few days
to implement. Maybe it doesn’t need all the features they’ve put into
ActivityPub. I’m pretty sure a lightweight social network is what’s
called for now. I know 20 different ventures have started up to do this,
but isn’t it weird that none of them have built on RSS. That’s the only
approach imho that has a chance of doing something unique here. I’d
rather work with other people, but I’m not into replacing simplicity
with something that’s not very simple.</p>

solved the puzzle every day for the last 36 days. It’s training my mind
– I see patterns I wouldn’t ordinarily see, because I spend as much as
an hour or two every day looking for patterns in letters, and finding
them, eventually. I wish at times my mind worked more like a computer.
When their bot says “there were only three possible solutions at that
point” – I wish I could see what they are at each point, or at least
know how many they are, if not what they are. The training has also
helped my mind debug software. I’m not as daunted as I often am when
there appears to be no solution to the problem I’m working on. I’m sure
I’ll find it eventually.</p>

<p>People who say Twitter is over aren’t considering how vast it is.
Same kind of situation as with Atom many years ago. It wasn’t obvious
how deeply installed RSS was, all the networks that had been created
with it. It was basically impossible at that time to displace RSS.
Anyway, same thing with Twitter today, no matter how vile
<a href="https://gizmodo.com/elon-musk-tweets-pizzagate-conspiracy-pedo-epstein-1851053448">the
owner</a> of the network is. It has been around since 2006, a time of
huge growth in networking, and it captured basically all of it. So if
there’s anyone you need to reach, and they’re hooked up to the net, you
almost certainly will be able to reach them on Twitter. This is another
situation like Napster. Never have you had all the music of our
civilization available so easily to so many people. We could have done
so much with that. The most prudent thing to do with Twitter is to
organize a buyout for Musk, and get him out of that position. We don’t
need to delete it, not that we could, we need to get Musk out of a
position of control.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Security researchers Jesse D’Aguanno and Timo Teräs write that, with
varying degrees of reverse-engineering and using some external hardware,
they were able to fool the Goodix fingerprint sensor in a Dell Inspiron
15, the Synaptic sensor in a Lenovo ThinkPad T14, and the ELAN sensor in
one of Microsoft’s own Surface Pro Type Covers. These are just three
laptop models from the wide universe of PCs, but one of these three
companies usually does make the fingerprint sensor in every laptop we’ve
reviewed in the last few years. It’s likely that most Windows PCs with
fingerprint readers will be vulnerable to similar exploits…

<h2 id="windows-nt-peeking-into-the-cradle">Windows NT: peeking into the
cradle</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-29, from: OS News</p>
<p>Reading the story of how Windows NT came to be was entertaining, as
it is a story of the system itself and the dynamics between Dave Cutler,
the original designer and lead for NT, and the other people involved in
the project. I was shy of being 10 years old when Windows NT launched
and I didn’t comprehend what was going on in the operating systems world
and why this release was such a big deal. Reading the book made me learn
various new things about the development process, the role of Microsoft
in that era, and allowed me to settle some questions I’ve had over the
years. This article is a mixture of a book review and a collection of
thoughts and reflections that the book evoked. Let’s begin because we
have a lot of ground to cover. Dave Cutler’s impact on the word of
computing really can’t be understated. I often wonder how he truly feels
about what his and his team’s creation turned into today – does he like
what Windows NT has become? Does he consider Windows 11 worthy of
carrying on the torch of NT? As Cutler still works at Microsoft, we
won’t get an answer any time soon, but I sure do hope he intends to
write down his memoirs in a tell-all book about his life and career,
because I’d be down for reading that.</p>

Chinese Loongsoon chip matches Intel’s 14600K in IPC tests</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-29, from: OS News</p>
<p>Chinese chip designer Loongson has finally launched its loong teased
“next-generation” 3A6000-series processors based on the LoongArch
microarchitecture. IPC tests showed the 3A6000 matching Intel’s Raptor
Lake i5-14600K in IPC (instructions per clock), with both chips clocked
at 2.5GHz. As well as the headlining x86 compatible processor came the
announcement of numerous partner desktop, laptop, and all-in-one
machines — plus a consumer-grade motherboard from Asus. It was also
entertaining to see a recorded overclocking session, which took an
LN2-cooled 3A6000 chip to the current maximum 3 GHz. Many of us are
being dismissive now, but give it a few more generations and Chinese PC
users won’t be depending on Intel or AMD anymore – and that’s pretty
impressive.</p>

the Monoprice Blackbird HDCP 2.2 to 1.4 down converter</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>I got my hands on a Monoprice Blackbird 4K Pro HDCP 2.2 to 1.4
Converter. According to the marketing copy it “is the definitive
solution for playback of new 4K HDCP 2.2 encoded content on 4K displays
with the old HDCP 1.4 standard.” Stuffed after a delicious Thanksgiving
meal, I decided to take it apart after the guests had left. It’s a
simple single-function device, so I didn’t expect much, but maybe
there’s some things to be learned? Turns out there’s a lot to learn, and
it’s also incredibly interesting. The note at the end about the legality
of this device is also interesting.</p>

<h2 id="red-hat-enterprise-linux-10-to-remove-x.org">Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 10 to remove X.org</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>With this, we’ve decided to remove Xorg server and other X servers
(except Xwayland) from RHEL 10 and the following releases. Xwayland
should be able to handle most X11 clients that won’t immediately be
ported to Wayland, and if needed, our customers will be able to stay on
RHEL 9 for its full life cycle while resolving the specifics needed for
transitioning to a Wayland ecosystem. It’s important to note that “Xorg
Server” and “X11” are not synonymous, X11 is a protocol that will
continue to be supported through Xwayland, while the Xorg Server is one
of the implementations of the X11 protocol. While we recognize the
energy behind some distributions and Fedora spins moving towards a
similar future, this decision is limited to RHEL 10—we recognize other
Linux distributions have different needs and decision structures, and
additionally we are not aware of plans for similar efforts in Fedora,
nor are we involved in similar efforts besides sharing our knowledge. A
sensible move, now that X.org is no longer really maintained and
considered legacy software by everyone who has the skillset and
knowledge to actually maintain it in the first place. I know a number of
people are very upset about the move to Wayland, but with nobody left
willing to work on X.org because it’s effectively unmaintainable,
there’s really no other way to go. If you really want X.org to continue
– perhaps you should channel the energy spent on writing angry online
comments towards contributing to X.org. However, with even the most
knowledgeable and capable X.org developers no longer wanting to have
anything to do with X.org, you’re going to be in for a rough ride.</p>

<h2 id="decentralized-finance-isnt">Decentralized Finance Isn’t</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-28, from: David Rosenthal’s blog</p>
A major theme of this blog since 2014’s
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/10/economies-of-scale-in-peer-to-peer.html"><i>Economies
of Scale in Peer-to-Peer Networks</i></a> has been that decentralized
systems aren’t, because economic forces overwhelm the technologies of
decentralization. Last year I noted that this rule applied to
Decentralized Finance (DeFi) in
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/03/shadow-banking-20.html"><i>Shadow
Banking 2.0</i></a> based on Prof. Hilary Allen’s
<a href="https://ssrn.com/abstract=4038788"><i>DeFi: Shadow Banking
2.0?</i></a> which she summarizes thus:<br />
<blockquote>
TL;DR: DeFi is neither decentralized, nor very good finance, so
regulators should have no qualms about clamping down on it to protect
the stability of our financial system and broader economy.
</blockquote>
And also <a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt2112b.htm"><i>
DeFi risks and the decentralisation illusion </i></a> by Sirio Aramonte,
Wenqian Huang and Andreas Schrimpf of the Bank for International
Settlements who write:<br />
<blockquote>
While the main vision of DeFi’s proponents is intermediation without
centralised entities, we argue that some form of centralisation is
inevitable. As such, there is a “decentralisation illusion”. First and
foremost, centralised governance is needed to take strategic and
operational decisions. In addition, some features in DeFi, notably the
consensus mechanism, favour a concentration of power.
</blockquote>
Below the fold I look at new evidence that the process of centralizing
DeFi is essentially complete.<br /> <span><a name='more'></a></span>

<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-16/defi-is-becoming-less-competitive-a-year-after-ftx-s-collapse-battered-crypto">research
from a “crypto-risk modeling company”</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Most categories in DeFi — from peer-to-peer lending to decentralized
exchanges — are seeing capital largely held in a few major projects,
according to data compiled by crypto-risk modeling company Gauntlet. The
firm used a popular measure of market concentration and competition
called the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index.
</blockquote>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herfindahl%E2%80%93Hirschman_index">Wikipedia</a>
explains the HHI thus:<br />
<blockquote>
HHI is calculated by squaring the market share of each competing firm in
the industry—expressed as either fractions, decimals, or whole
numbers—and then summing the resulting numbers … The result is
proportional to the average market share, weighted by market share. As
such, it can range from 0 to 1.0, moving from a huge number of very
small firms to a single monopolistic producer.

<blockquote>
Based on the metric, the most competition exists between decentralized
finance exchanges, with the top four venues holding about 54% of total
market share. Other categories including decentralized derivatives
exchanges, DeFi lenders, and liquid staking, are much less competitive.
For example, the top four liquid staking projects hold about 90% of
total market share in that category, according to Gauntlet.

<p></font> Shen provides a breakdown of the last 180 days revenue of
DeFi projects, which I reformatted into this table. It shows that the
top project, Lido, has 55% of the revenue, the top two have 2/3, and the
top four projects have 78%. This is clearly a highly concentrated
market, typical of cryptocurrency markets in general.<br /> <br /> Why
does the centralization of Defi matter? First, for all the bad things
concentration causes in general markets — see for example Matt Stoller’s
<a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/"><i>Big</i></a>. But more
importantly, because the technologies of decentralization impose massive
costs over and above those of equivalent centralized systems. The
incentive to pay these additional costs is to reap the profits
centralized systems sacrifice to regulation. If you are paying the costs
but not evading regulation, what is the point? I discussed this in
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2023/02/economic-incentives.html"><i>Economic
Incentives</i></a>.<br /> <br /> I’ve argued many times, most recently
to the
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2023/09/brief-remarks-to-iosco-defi-wg.html">IOSCO
DeFi Working Group</a>, that regulators should ignore the alleged
“decentralization” of cryptocurrency systems and
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/12/dominoes.html">go after the major
players</a> in each area. With lawsuits against
<a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/?id=sam-bankman-fried-convicted">FTX’
management</a>,
<a href="https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2023/06/07/the-sec-sues-coinbase-its-on/">Coinbase</a>,
<a href="https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2023/10/30/new-york-vs-dcg-genesis-and-gemini-kids-kids-youre-both-ugly/">DCG/Genesis
and Gemini</a>,
<a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/?id=kraken-sued-by-us-sec">Kraken</a>,
and
<a href="https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2023/07/15/crypto-collapse-alex-mashinsky-of-celsius-arrested-ripples-bizarre-xrp-win-gemini-sues-genesis-gisele-bundchen-knew-nothing/">Celsius
and Alex Mashinsky</a>, and now their
<a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/binance-and-ceo-plead-guilty-federal-charges-4b-resolution">$4.3B
criminal conviction of Binance and CZ</a>, the US regulators no longer
seem to be going after the small fry. Presumably, they used winning
against the small fry to build precedents they are now using against
bigger fish.<br /> <br /> If despite claims of “decentralization”
regulators can shut down the few big players in a market, the
decentralized systems will be paying the massive extra costs but not
reaping the unregulated profits. Of course, there is a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whac-A-Mole">Whac-A-Mole</a>
aspect; kill a big player and one or more smaller players will get
bigger enough to be worth taking out. But it won’t take many of these
cycles for the market to get the message.<br /> <br /></p>

Time for probably the final housekeeping post of 2023. I doubt I’ll make
a new one in December but we’ll see.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
This site now runs on Kirby 4! I absolutely love Kirby, been using it to
run this site since 2017 and I also used it for countless other
projects. The
<a href="https://getkirby.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">new V4
has officially been released</a> earlier today and the upgrade process
went super smoothly. Only had to update 2 lines of code inside 1 single
file and that was it. Stoked about that.
</p>
<p>
Next up, as mentioned in a previous post, Craig Mod has a new book out
and copies are moving FAST. Signed copies have sold out in I think 24
hours and unsigned copies are also selling quickly. So if you want one,
<a href="https://shop.specialprojects.jp/products/things-become-other-things-1st-ed/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">I
suggest you act now and don't wait too long</a>.
</p>
<p>
Carl is
<a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/099-supply" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">running
a campaign on Product Hunt</a> to spread the word about his 099. The
project itself is neat and Carl has put a lot of effort into it so if
you happen to be a PH user, just give it an upvote.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, an update from me: I’m busy as hell, working on way too many
things at once but also excited because it’s nice to have things to do,
plus Christmas is approaching fast and that puts me in a good mood 🎄

Israeli government has Haaretz newspaper in its sights as it tightens
the screws on media freedom</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-28, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>The Israeli government is putting pressure on the left-leaning
newspaper Haaretz to line up in support of the government in its conduct
of the war in Gaza. The communications minister, Shlomo Karhi, has
suggested financial penalties be applied to the paper, accusing it of
“lying, defeatist propaganda” and “sabotaging Israel in wartime.” The
proposal aims to cancel…</p>

from VM to Hierarchical Jails in FreeBSD</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>FreeBSD has supported nesting of jails natively since version 8.0,
which dates back to 2009. Looking at the jail(8) man page, there is an
entire paragraph named Hierarchical Jails that explains the concept of
jail hierarchy well. It’s one of the many gems of FreeBSD that, although
not widely known or used, is, in my opinion, extremely useful.
BastilleBSD plays a central role in this article, and that’s a project
I’ve been hearing a lot about recently. I feel like the various BSDs are
currently hitting a stride, and there seems to be a lot of movement from
Linux to BSD at the moment.</p>

<p>PipeWire 1.0 now has all the features that are expected to move media
streams inside a system. It takes advantage of advanced features of the
Linux kernel to provide low latency, low footprint, and high performance
while being secure. It is the perfect tool to build an embedded system
or to securely share streams between containers. Linux audio and video
has come a long way, and PipeWire is part of that. Excellent work.</p>

<h2 id="this-company-just-put-the-air-in-apples-macbook-air">This
company just put the air in Apple’s MacBook Air</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>Frore Systems is a startup with $116 million in funding, and I’ve
shown you its first product before: the AirJet Mini is a piezoelectric
cooling chip that weighs just nine grams and is thinner than two US
quarters stacked together. Each nominally consumes one watt and can
remove 4.25 additional watts of heat. Here’s the question: what would
happen if Frore used those AirJets to cool a laptop that normally
doesn’t have a fan at all? What the company discovered — and I saw
firsthand — is that Apple’s M2 chip can run faster, for longer, with
Frore’s tech on board. Without it, a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air was like a
runner that can’t sprint indefinitely without running out of breath. But
with three AirJet Minis, the same laptop got a permanent second wind.
Frore’s AirJet coolers have been featured on YouTube channels like LTT
as well, and there’s no doubt in my mind these will be the future of
laptop cooling, especially in the thinner segment of the laptop market.
At least in thin laptops, AirJets are better in virtually every way than
fans, and provide far superior cooling compared to fanless designs
without adding bulk or noise. The only thing that sucks as an enthusiast
is that you can’t really modify an existing laptop yourself. Either this
company gets gobbled up by an OEM, or their products will make their way
in almost every thin laptop.</p>

Play keeps banning the same web browser due to vague DMCA notices</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>App developer Elias Saba has had some bad luck with Digital
Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) takedowns. His Android TV app
Downloader, which combines a web browser with a file manager, was
suspended by Google Play in May after several Israeli TV companies
complained that the app could be used to load a pirate website. Google
reversed that suspension after three weeks. But Downloader has been
suspended by Google Play again, and this time the reason is even harder
to understand. Based on a vague DMCA notice, it appears that Downloader
was suspended simply because it can load the Warner Bros. website.
Application stores are basically random number generators. The worst
possible applications, from non-functional garbage to ad-ridden gambling
games designed to prey on children, make up the bulk of what’s on offer,
but functional, useful applications spiral into Kafkaesque bureaucratic
dark holes. Being a mobile developer in 2023 is a nightmare.</p>

Data</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-28, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<p>
<div style="float:right;margin:10px">
<p><a href="https://www.crossref.org/pdfs/stm-research-data-infographic-FINAL-4.pdf" title="Download PDF">
<img src="https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2023/stm-research-data-infographic-FINAL-4.jpg" width="400"/>
</a></p>
</div>
</p>
<p>
STM, DataCite, and Crossref are pleased to announce an updated joint
statement on research data.
</p>
<p>
In 2012, DataCite and STM drafted an
<a href="https://www.stm-assoc.org/2012_06_14_STM_DataCite_Joint_Statement.pdf" target="_blank">initial
joint statement</a> on the linkability and citability of research data.
With nearly 10 million data citations tracked, thousands of repositories
adopting data citation best practices, thousands of journals adopting
data policies, data availability statements and establishing persistent
links between articles and datasets, and the introduction of data
policies by an increasing number of funders, there has been significant
progress since. It now seems appropriate to focus on providing updated
recommendations for the various stakeholders involved in research data
sharing.
</p>
<p>
The premise of the original joint statement still stands: most
stakeholders across the spectrum of researchers, funders, librarians and
publishers agree about the benefits of making research data available
and findable for reuse by others. This improves utility and rigor of the
scholarly record. Still, research data sharing is not yet a self-evident
step in the research lifecycle. We now have sufficient scholarly
communication infrastructure in place to bring about widespread change
and believe momentum is building for collective action.
</p>
<p>
It is in this context that DataCite, a global membership community
working with over 2800 repositories around the world, and STM, whose
membership consists of over 140 scientific, technical, and medical
publishing organizations, are issuing this joint statement. Crossref, a
nonprofit open infrastructure with over 18,000 institutional members
from 150 countries, joins this call, recognising the need for an
amplified focus on data citation. The aim of this statement is to
accelerate adoption of best practices and policies, and encourage
further development of critical policies in collaboration with a wide
group of stakeholders.
</p>
<p>
Signatories of this statement recommend the following as best practice
in research data sharing:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
When publishing their results, researchers deposit related research data
and outputs in a trustworthy data repository that assigns persistent
identifiers (DOIs where available). Researchers link to research data
using persistent identifiers.
</li>
<li>
When using research data created by others, researchers provide
attribution by citing the datasets in the reference section using
persistent identifiers.
</li>
<li>
Data repositories enable sharing of research outputs in a FAIR way,
including support for metadata quality and completeness.
</li>
<li>
Publishers set appropriate journal data policies, describing the way in
which data is to be shared alongside the published article.
</li>
<li>
Publishers set instructions for authors to include Data Citations with
persistent identifiers in the references section of articles.
</li>
<li>
Publishers include Data Citations and links to data in Data Availability
Statements with persistent identifiers (DOIs where available) in the
article metadata registered with Crossref.
</li>
<li>
In addition to Data Citations, Data Availability Statements (human- and
machine-readable) are included in published articles where appropriate.
</li>
<li>
Repositories and publishers connect articles and datasets through
persistent identifier connections in the metadata and reference lists.
</li>
<li>
Funders and research organizations provide researchers with guidance on
open science practices, track compliance with open science policies
where possible, and promote and incentivize researchers to openly share,
cite and link research data.
</li>
<li>
Funders, policymaking institutions, publishers and research
organizations collaborate towards aligning FAIR research data policies
and guidelines.
</li>
<li>
All stakeholders collaborate in the development of tools, processes, and
incentives throughout the research cycle to enable sharing of
high-quality research data, making all steps in the process clear, easy
and efficient for researchers by providing support and guidance.
</li>
<li>
Stakeholders responsible for research assessment take into account data
sharing and data citation in their reward and recognition system
structures.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
We, the following signatories shall adopt and promote the relevant best
practices laid out above. We hope that our action inspires the
community, including researchers, research funders, research
institutions, data repositories and publishers, to join us in making it
easy for researchers to share, link and cite research data.

<h2 id="building-a-netbsd-ramdisk-kernel">Building a NetBSD ramdisk
kernel</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-27, from: OS News</p>
<p>When I used OpenBSD, I was a big fan of bsd.rd: a kernel that
includes a root file system with an installer and a few tools. When I
invariably did something bad to my root file system, I could use that to
repair things. bsd.rd is also helpful for OS updates. And there is only
a single file involved. On NetBSD however, there is usually no netbsd.rd
kernel installed, or even available by default. The facility is there,
it’s just not standard. To be fair, there are a number of architectures
that use kernels with a ramdisk for installation. Recently, I have been
toying with NetBSD on an Orange Pi 5. This is a 64-bit ARM board, using
the evbarm-aarch64 architecture. I am booting from an SD card (details
in a followup post) but once booted, the kernel does not see the card
any more, only the NVMe SSD. So my thoughts went back to bsd.rd and I
decided that I want one! Such a kernel seems like a very useful tool to
have, so if you’re running NetBSD – this guide will help you add it to
your toolbox.</p>

<h2 id="schatzkarten">Schatzkarten</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-27, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
Schatzkarten
</h1>
<p>
Schatzkarten als Teil der Schätze sind wichtig, weil sie kleine Aufgaben
darstellen. Wenn das Ziel in der Nähe ist, sei es im Nachbarhex bei der
Reise Überland oder in einem Raum in der Nähe im Megadungeon, der Effekt
ist immer gleich.
</p>
<p>
Die Spielerinnen und Spieler freuen sich! Das ist das wichtigste.
</p>
<p>
Es ist eine Ablenkung von was auch immer Spielerinnen und Spieler sonst
vor haben. Ablenkung ist für mich eine wichtige Herausforderung im
Spiel. Wie sehr will ich als Spieler etwas? Wenn ich mich ständig
ablenken lasse, dann war es mir vielleicht eben doch nicht so wichtig.
</p>
<p>
Es ist eine Einladung, ein grösseres Risiko einzugehen. Meistens zeigt
die Schatzkarte ja in das unbekannte Gebiet. Haben wir noch genug
Trefferpunkte, Zaubersprüche und andere Ressourcen? Wollen wir es wagen?
</p>
<p>
Deswegen dürfen Schatzkarten nicht auf Schätze verweisen, die zu weit
weg sind oder die erst in einem halben dutzend Spielabenden erreicht
werden können. Zudem sind Schatzkarten ja eine Belohnung, deswegen
sollten die Fundorte nicht nochmal speziell geschützt sein, denn sonst
wäre der Schatz ja den neuen Wächtern zuzurechnen. Nein, falls es am Ort
neue Wächter hat, dann haben diese ebenfalls Schätze.
</p>
<p>
Soviel zur Vorrede. Für <a href="Horte">Horte</a> habe ich im Moment

</p>
<ol>
<li>

Zepter, Ringe, Halskette, Armreif, Kelch)
</li>

Miniaturen, Kelche, Schüsseln, Ikonen, heilige Schriften)
</li>
<li>
Karte zu einem Versteck von Geflohenen: 1W6×1000 Gold

<p>
According to the letter, a surveillance program now known as Data
Analytical Services (DAS) has for more than a decade allowed federal,
state, and local law enforcement agencies to mine the details of
Americans’ calls, analyzing the phone records of countless people who
are not suspected of any crime, including victims. Using a technique
known as chain analysis, the program targets not only those in direct
phone contact with a criminal suspect but anyone with whom those
individuals have been in contact as well…

tiny Windows 11 OS gets a big update: Tiny11 2311 shrinks 20% and allows
cumulative updates</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-27, from: OS News</p>
<p>NTDEV, the developer behind Tiny11, has released a new update for its
miniature Windows 11 operating system, called Tiny11 2311, that adds
Microsoft’s latest feature update, 23H2, into the OS and introduces a
plethora of bug fixes addressing issues in the outgoing version of
Tiny11. On top of this, the new update also shrinks Tiny11’s install
size by a whopping 20%, making Tiny11’s renowned footprint even smaller.
There is absolutely no need for Windows 11 to be as big and invasive as
it is, and it feels like such a shame and missed opportunity to burden
an otherwise good and capable operating system with such cruft and
useless junk.</p>

<h2 id="human-connection">Human connection</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-26, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<p>
In a
<a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/on-creating-beautiful-things">recent
post</a> I mentioned that I am a <em>sucker for signed books and limited
editions</em>. The reason for that has nothing to do with the uniqueness
of a signed object or its potential extra monetary value. Those are all
aspects that have no meaning to me. The reason why I love signed books
it’s the same reason why I love handmade objects: the human connection.
Knowing that someone picked up that book and took a second to open it up
and sign it adds that extra something that makes my brain happy.
</p>
<p>
And in a world that’s more and more digital and artificial, I think
these small human touches are going to become increasingly more
valuable.

<h2 id="how-apples-developers-reflashed-mac-roms-in-the-90s">How Apple’s
developers reflashed Mac ROMs in the ’90s</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-26, from: OS News</p>
<p>After I wrote about the possibility of programmable Mac ROM SIMMs in
Quadras a couple of months ago, I suspected that there had been a way
for developers at Apple in the 68k Mac era to reflash the ROM in their
Macs during development, just like BIOS updates on PCs. The reason I
believed this is because the ROM SIMM socket in the Quadras brought out
pins for 12V (VPP) and write enable (/WE). I had verified that the write
enable pin was going into the memory controller chip in several Mac
models, so I was pretty confident that in-system programming was
possible. As luck would have it, multiple people pointed out to me that
an Apple internal utility used for ROM flashing had been uploaded to the
Macintosh Garden. It was recovered from a prototype PowerBook 520
purchased in 2020. Of course, I had to download this utility and figure
out how it works. I honestly cannot believe it’s taken this long for
such a tool to become available one way or the other. Classic Macs are
incredibly popular in the retro community, and being able to reflash the
ROMs like this is incredibly useful. It took some work and disassembly,
but Doug Brown got it working.</p>

MIPS64EL CPU port is at risk due to declining hardware access</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-26, from: OS News</p>
<p>Debian’s MIPS64EL that is a 64-bit little endian port using the N64
ABI is at risk due to declining access for building the Debian 64-bit
MIPS packages. MIPS64EL is now being treated as an “out of sync”
architecture due to lacking sufficient build daemon resources for timely
building new packages and if the situation doesn’t improve, it may not
be suitable as a release architecture for Debian 13 “Trixie”. Not all
architectures last forever, and as time goes on, more and more of these
once promising architectures will simply no longer be part of the modern
Linux world. It makes sense – but it’s still sad.</p>

quick look back at Microsoft’s first sports video game: Microsoft
Olympic Decathlon</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-26, from: OS News</p>
<p>Ironically, the second commercial game that Microsoft published,
after Microsoft Adventure in 1979, was an attempt at a sports game sim.
It was called Microsoft Olympic Decathlon, and like Microsoft Adventure,
it was first launched as a TRS-80 PC game, this time in 1980. Microsoft
has so many unexpected products in its long history.</p>

shot</a> of the latest prototype for the new Scripting News home page.
It does the job I wanted it to do, presents in one user interface the
content of my blog, linkblog, and several timelines from FeedLand. The
previous version had the tab links
<a href="http://scripting.com/2023/11/24/190107.html">down the left
edge</a>. I loved the way it looked on my desktop system, but then I
tried it on my iPad, and realized it didn’t work. Not enough horizonal
real estate to pull it off. So I went back to the tabs-across-the-top
format. I had to drop one of the tabs, and not use the nice Font-Awesome
icons I used previously on Scripting News when there was
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/11/26/currentScriptingHome.png">plenty
of room</a>. The page is entirely assembled when you load it, so it only
works with JavaScript turned on.</p>

<p><a href="https://colinwalker.blog/blog/?date=2023-11-26#p1">Colin
Walker wonders</a> if he should try
<a href="https://bsky.app/">Bluesky</a>. I say yes. At first I was
pretty negative, after the implosion of Twitter, here was another
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Dorsey">Jack Dorsey</a>
network. I wasn’t in the mood. But eventually I tried it, and I liked it
very much. The mood is civil and often artistic. There are some very
creative people there. And I think the API, while it’s
<a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/892d671e-1dc9-4ffc-9101-cadbca842adc">inscrutable</a>
to me, is understandable to developers who put their minds to it, and I
expect Colin is one who will figure it out. And I don’t think there’s
any hope of ActivityPub, it’s far too underspecified, and interop is
likely to be product-based, not based on the protocol, where the Bluesky
protocol appears to be overly-well-thought-out, or maybe the docs could
have more examples. I didn’t have the time to dive into it when I
looked.</p>

<a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/oppenheimer/">Oppenheimer</a>
last night. Very good movie. I like the artistic flourishes, reminds me
of another movie I watched recently and liked, a lot,
<a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/spencer/">Spencer</a>. I
wasn’t really interested in the life and death of Lady Di, but I also
got through the latest episodes of The Crown, which I had resisted when
the newest Queen was
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crown_(season_5)">introduced</a>.
I find it hard to make the adjustment to new actors playing the roles of
characters I had come to love, esp
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claire_Foy">Claire Foy</a> as
young Queen Elizabeth, a fantastic actress who played in one of the most
spectacular dramatic
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBwQICiGRmw">scenes</a>
anywhere anytime. The
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crown_(season_6)">latest
episodes</a> of The Crown were about Diana mostly, and were fantastic.
Back to Oppenheimer. I’ll try not to spoil it too much, but the drama is
puzzling, why are they going after Oppenheimer when he miraculously put
together the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Project">Manhattan
Project</a> which created, in a race with Germany and the USSR, the bomb
that ended World War II. The final scene, a flashback to an earlier
scene where we didn’t hear the dialog, between Oppenheimer and his
colleague at Princeton,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein">Albert
Einstein</a>, about what happens when you create something that changes
the direction of humanity. What happens is this – they push you aside.
I’m not comparing myself to these two giants, but I have had the same
question about how tech reacted to my contributions. My conclusion was
that our culture has reason to erase the accomplishments of outliers. We
prefer innovation to come in nice predictable packages, with a PR person
on top, and when that’s disturbed, we close ranks to make it all appear
very ordinary. Anyway, all of this is very good holiday entertainment
and thought provoking. My next adventure in video is
<a href="https://www.metacritic.com/tv/pachinko/">Pachinko</a> on Apple
TV, which is somewhat confusing, but keeps me coming back, it’s so
compelling. I still have the last seasons of
<a href="https://www.metacritic.com/tv/ted-lasso/">Ted Lasso</a> and
<a href="https://www.metacritic.com/tv/reservation-dogs/">Reservation
Dogs</a> in the queue. And of course there’s a new season of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fargo_(season_5)">Fargo</a>,
which I’m sure I’ll love. Right now my plan is to wait for the series to
end and watch it all in a binge.</p>
