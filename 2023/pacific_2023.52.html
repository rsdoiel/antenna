<p>(AP) — Director George Clooney both begins and ends “The Boys in the Boat” on a sun-dappled lake. It’s a seductive sight, calm and soothing, and aptly reflects the ethos of a film that often feels like one has walked into an oil painting: well-crafted, lovely to look at, and rather old-fashioned.</p>

<p>date: 2023-12-25, updated: 2023-12-25, from: Marianas Variety</p>
<p>THE TRUTH of the matter is every politician should strive to MAKE-SURE that she/he does some things that their constituents can see, feel for themselves or family or touch something like a structure like Rep. Thomas John Dela Cruz Manglona and his family did for Precinct 5 for Christmas. He passed out a lot of free lunches until they ran out. He even set up a place with tables so people could gather and eat together. When my wife came home I had to say something because this is at the very CORE of what our politicians should be doing, not putting more taxes on the people that they can feel but believe me they don’t like and will remember it when they get in the voting booth.</p>

<p>HISTORIANS and political scientists are growing more comfortable using the term Cold War Two when describing the international tension between China and the United States.  The first Cold War was between the United States and the Soviet Union from about 1945 through 1991 when the Soviet Union collapsed into pieces, the largest being Russia.  The similarities between that Cold War and the current situation are striking.</p>
