## Urinary microbiota signatures associated with different types of urinary diversion: a comparative study

date: 2024-01-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Background</title><p>Radical cystectomy and urinary diversion (UD) are gold standards for non-metastatic muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Orthotopic neobladder (or Studer), ileal conduit (or Bricker) and cutaneous ureterostomy (CU) are mainstream UD types. Little is known about urinary microbiological changes after UD. </p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In this study, urine samples were collected from healthy volunteers and patients with bladder cancer who had received aforementioned UD procedures. Microbiomes of samples were analyzed using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing, and microbial diversities, distributions and functions were investigated and compared across groups. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Highest urine microbial richness and diversity were observed in healthy controls, followed by Studer patients, especially those without hydronephrosis or residual urine, α-diversity indices of whom were remarkably higher than those of Bricker and CU groups. Studer UD type was the only independent factor favoring urine microbial diversity. The urine microflora structure of the Studer group was most similar to that of the healthy individuals while that of the CU group was least similar. Studer patients and healthy volunteers shared many similar urine microbial functions, while Bricker and CU groups exhibited opposite characteristics. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study first presented urinary microbial landscapes of UD patients and demonstrated the microbiological advantage of orthotopic neobladder. Microbiota might be a potential tool for optimization of UD management.</p></sec>

## Human and animal exposure to newly discovered sand fly viruses, China

date: 2024-01-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The Hedi virus (HEDV) and Wuxiang virus (WUXV) are newly discovered Bunyaviruses transmitted by sandflies. The geographical distribution of isolation of these two viruses continues to expand and it has been reported that WUXV causes neurological symptoms and even death in suckling mice. However, little is known about the prevalence of the two viruses in mammalian infections.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In order to understand the infection status of HEDV and WUXV in humans and animals from regions where the viruses have been isolated, this study used Western blotting to detect the positive rates of HEDV and WUXV IgG antibodies in serum samples from febrile patients, dogs, and chickens in the forementioned regions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The results showed that of the 29 human serum samples, 17.24% (5/29) tested positive for HEDV, while 68.96% (20/29) were positive for WUXV. In the 31 dog serum samples, 87.10% (27/31) were positive for HEDV and 70.97% (22/31) were positive for WUXV, while in the 36 chicken serum samples, 47.22% (17/36) were positive for HEDV, and 52.78% (19/36) were positive for WUXV.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>These findings suggest there are widespread infections of HEDV and WUXV in mammals (dogs, chickens) and humans from the regions where these viruses have been isolated. Moreover, the positive rate of HEDV infections was higher in local animals compared to that measured in human specimens. This is the first seroepidemiological study of these two sandfly-transmitted viruses. The findings of the study have practical implications for vector-borne viral infections and related zoonotic infections in China, as well as providing an important reference for studies on the relationship between sandfly-transmitted viruses and zoonotic infections outside of China.</p></sec>

## Transovarial transmission of mosquito-borne viruses: a systematic review

date: 2024-01-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Background</title><p>A number of mosquito-borne viruses (MBVs), such as dengue virus (DENV), zika virus (ZIKV), chikungunya (CHIKV), West Nile virus (WNV), and yellow fever virus (YFV) exert adverse health impacts on the global population. <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> are the prime vectors responsible for the transmission of these viruses. The viruses have acquired a number of routes for successful transmission, including horizontal and vertical transmission. Transovarial transmission is a subset/type of vertical transmission adopted by mosquitoes for the transmission of viruses from females to their offspring through eggs/ovaries. It provides a mechanism for these MBVs to persist and maintain their lineage during adverse climatic conditions of extremely hot and cold temperatures, during the dry season, or in the absence of susceptible vertebrate host when horizontal transmission is not possible.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The publications discussed in this systematic review were searched for using the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases, and websites such as those of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, using the search terms “transovarial transmission” and “mosquito-borne viruses” from 16 May 2023 to 20 September 2023.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 2,391 articles were searched, of which 123 were chosen for full text evaluation, and 60 were then included in the study after screening and removing duplicates.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present systematic review focuses on understanding the above diseases, their pathogenesis, epidemiology and host–parasite interactions. The factors affecting transovarial transmission, potential implications, mosquito antiviral defense mechanism, and the control strategies for these mosquito-borne viral diseases (MBVDs) are also be included in this review.</p></sec>

## The impact of Helicobacter pylori infection on low skeletal muscle mass risk in Chinese women over 40: a cross-sectional analysis

date: 2024-01-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Background</title><p>Sarcopenia can lead to significant personal, social, and economic burdens. The diagnosis of sarcopenia heavily relies on the identification of Low Skeletal Muscle Mass (LSMM), which is an independent predictor of frailty, disability, and increased risk of death among seniors. Women have physiologically lower levels of skeletal muscle mass than men, and female sarcopenia appears to be more influenced by menopause. They also tend to have higher body fat levels than man, which increases the risk of sarcopenia obesity. On another front, it’s also recognized that humans are largely prone to <italic>Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)</italic> infection, with global prevalence rates often surpassing 50%. Nevertheless, the interconnection between <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection and LSMM remains relatively unexplored. Hence, our study specifically targeted women as the research population and sought to explore several risk factors for LSMM. Additionally, we delved into the potential correlation between LSMM and <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection in women, hoping to gain insights into potential preventative measures or treatment options that may enhance the quality of life for women affected by sarcopenia.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We conducted a cross-sectional study among women aged over 18 years undergoing physical examination. We performed 13C-urea breath test (UBT) for diagnosis of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection and Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) for the assessment of LSMM. Logistic regression models were used to analyze the associations of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection with LSMM.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>This study enrolled 1984 Chinese women who were undergoing health check-ups. A univariate logistic regression analysis did not reveal a direct correlation between <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection and LSMM among this female population (OR=1.149, 95% CI 0.904-1.459, <italic>p</italic>=0.257). Yet, upon dividing the participants into age-based subgroups, an evident link was observed between <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection and LSMM in women aged 40 or above (OR=1.381, 95%CI 1.032-1.848, <italic>p</italic>= 0.030). After adjusting for variables including Age, BMI, TP, ALK, Cre, this relationship remained statistically relevant (OR=1.514, 95%CI 1.085-2.113, <italic>p</italic>= 0.015).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Women who are over 40 years old and currently infected with <italic>H. pylori</italic> have an increased risk of developing LSMM. Therefore, timely treatment for <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication is recommended for this group of women to reduce the occurrence of LSMM.</p></sec>

## The crosstalk of intratumor bacteria and the tumor

date: 2024-01-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<p>The in-depth studies reveal the interaction between the host and commensal microbiomes. Symbiotic bacteria influence in tumor initiation, progression, and response to treatment. Recently, intratumor bacteria have been a burgeoning research field. The tumor microenvironment is under vascular hyperplasia, aerobic glycolysis, hypoxia, and immunosuppression. It might be attractive for bacterial growth and proliferation. As a component of the tumor microenvironment, intratumor bacteria influence tumor growth and metastasis, as well as the efficacy of anti-tumor therapies. Therefore, understanding the intricate interplay of intratumoral bacteria and the host might contribute to better approaches to treat tumors. In this review, we summarize current evidence about roles of intratumor bacteria in tumor initiation and anti-tumor therapy, and what is remained to be solved in this field.</p>

## Effect of Lactobacillus plantarum ZFM4 in Helicobacter pylori-infected C57BL/6 mice: prevention is better than cure

date: 2024-01-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

<sec><title>Objectives</title><p>This study was performed to explore the preventive and therapeutic effects of <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> ZFM4 on H. pylori infections of the stomach tissue in C57BL/6 mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In this study, 40 specific-pathogen-free female C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into five groups, namely, the control, ZFM4 pretreatment) ZFM4 pretreatment before <italic>H. pylori</italic> infected), model (<italic>H. pylori</italic> infected), triple therapy (<italic>H. pylori</italic> infected and treated with triple therapy), and ZFM4 treatment groups (<italic>H. pylori</italic> infected and treated with ZFM4). The preventive and therapeutic effects of <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> ZFM4 were evaluated in <italic>H. pylori-</italic>infected C57BL/6 mice by assessing gastric tissue morphology, inflammatory cytokine levels, microbial composition, and microbial diversity.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p><italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> ZFM4 was able to survive in low gastric pH and play a role in preventing <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection. This was evident from a reduction in both, the gastric inflammatory response and expression of inflammatory factors caused by <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection. <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> ZFM4 could also inhibit the growth of <italic>H. pylori</italic> via its beneficial impact on the gastric microbiota.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our findings suggest that <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> ZFM4 offers superior preventive effects against <italic>H. pylori</italic> infections when used alone. However, the therapeutic effect on established infections is weaker. Further clinical trials are needed to confirm the specific dosage, duration, and other aspects of administration.</p></sec>
