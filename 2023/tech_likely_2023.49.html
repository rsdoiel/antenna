<p>date: 2023-12-08, from: OS News</p>
<p>Fvwm3, the successor to fvwm 2.6, has a new version, 1.0.9. This
highly customisable and lightweight window manager for X has been around
for a very long time, since 1993, and has been in development ever
since. This new release, as the version number suggests, does not have
the longest changelog. If you’re a user of fvwm, you already know
exactly what 1.0.9 will mean for you.</p>

misreads room, awkwardly brags about its “less hated” printers</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-08, from: OS News</p>
<p>HP knows people have grown to hate printers. It even knows that
people hate HP printers. But based on a new marketing campaign the
company launched, HP is OK with that—so long as it can convince people
that there are worse options out there. The marketing campaign hitting
parts of Europe aims to present HP as real and empathetic. The tagline
“Made to be less hated” seems to acknowledge people’s frustration with
printers. But HP’s a top proponent of the exact sort of money-grabbing,
disruptive practices that have turned people against printers. ↫ Scharon
Harding at Ars Technica I need to print something maybe a few times a
year, and I still hate dealing with my printer more than any other tech
item in my house. Everything about them is bad, and no cutesy marketing
campaign centrered on them being bad is going to change that.</p>

officially launches its PS5 Access Controller for disabled gamers</h2>

<p>The controller, which was created in collaboration with disabled
gaming groups such as AbleGamers, Stack-Up, and SpecialEffect, has a
unique circular design. The controller comes with a number of different
button caps, along with three stick caps that can be changed out to suit
the specific needs of the gamer. The controller itself is also designed
to rest on a flat surface for players that would require that kind of
feature. ↫ John Callaham at Neowin Microsoft has a similar product as
well, and it’s great that disabled people who want to play games are
being taken so much more seriously these days. Excellent work from both
console giants.</p>

<h2 id="why-we-want-feeds-in-bluesky">Why we want feeds in Bluesky</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-07, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
My old friend
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22chuck+shotton%22">Chuck
Shotton</a> just
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mrwheat.bsky.social">showed up</a> on
Bluesky.
</p>
<p>
I love Chuck. We’ve been through a lot together over a long time.
</p>
<p>
We had a ton of fun in the early days of the web on the Mac. Chuck wrote
the HTTP server we all used. And he loved Frontier, so we made our
products work incredibly well together.
</p>
<p>
Those were the days! <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>
</p>
<p>
Anyway, of course I immediately followed Chuck in Bluesky, but then I
realize, I can also follow him
<a href="https://feedland.com/?feedurl=https%3A%2F%2Frss.firesky.tv%2F%3Ffilter%3Dfrom%3Amrwheat.bsky.social">in
FeedLand</a> because thanks to John Spurlock,
<a href="https://rss.firesky.tv/?filter=from:mrwheat.bsky.social">we
have feeds</a> for every freaking Bluesky user.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+spurlock">Spurlock</a>
is a gifted programmer, like Chuck, who thinks creatively and doesn’t
mind priming the pump of a bootstrap, something Chuck and I have done
many times in the past. (Chuck is an largely uncredited contributor to
the bootstraps of RSS, XML-RPC, podcasting, object databases, content
management systems, hey pretty much everything I’ve worked on since 1994
or so.)
</p>
<p>
Okay, now I get to the point.
</p>
<p>
I want to build with confidence on the feed connection with Bluesky.
Today I know the ability to
<a href="https://feedland.com/?feedurl=https%3A%2F%2Frss.firesky.tv%2F%3Ffilter%3Dfrom%3Ascripting.com">subscribe</a>
to a <a href="https://rss.firesky.tv/?filter=from:scripting.com">Bluesky
RSS 2.0 feed</a> is there, but will it be there in the future? I would
feel better if the feed support were built-into Bluesky, part of its
basic feature set. Another very simple API that gets ideas out of
Bluesky and anywhere feeds go, which is, as you know, everywhere.
</p>
<p>
Feeds should be the baseline of compatibility between social media
platforms.
</p>
<p>
Working with Spurlock, we have given Bluesky a huge headstart, a lead in
what I hope will be a race to feed support in all the social media apps,
to hook them up to the worldwide feed bus. It’s a way to get interop
without having to concede that any comprehensive API is the winner.
Think of RSS 2.0 support at the TCP of social networking, offering a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_denominator">LCD</a>
compatibility to a world that desperately needs one.
</p>
<p>
And then after we have that, we can talk about the format of the data
we’re sending over this network. We have some work to do there too, but
luckily the capabilities and limits of RSS 2.0 are a perfect match here.
</p>
<p>
In summary, the reason we want it is so we can do more with confidence
with Bluesky, integrate it into more systems.
</p>
<p>
The reason the Bluesky people should want it is that it offers a way to
interop with all social nets, that will take almost no effort on their
part, and there’s no guesswork, we already know how to make feeds that
will work pretty much everywhere, and it lets them take the lead in what
will be an important way to communicate on the net.
</p>
<p>
And the reason it’s good for all of us is we can start viewing the web
once again as a fully supported writing environment, and let the writers
of the world get to work on solving all our problems (of which we have
many) and get the freaking technology out of their way.
</p>
<p>
Think of it as the feed-iverse, it’s easier and more low-level than the
fed-iverse, and can be implemented in a weekend. And it’s fun!

Scripting News</strong> (date: 2023-12-07, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting
News)</p>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corollary">corrollary</a> to
the <a href="http://textcasting.org/">textcasting</a> philosophy is that
I should be able to use any writing tool I like to post to the web, and
have it flow where ever I want. The idea of being forced to use a teeny
little edit box to write my wonderful prose is as silly as bunding a
word processor with a printer, and forcing you to use that editor if you
want to print it with that printer. If I sent you a document written for
my Brand X printer but you had Brand Y, sorry – you can’t read it. I’m
at the point in my life where I have to explain to young folk how great
things were when I was their age, but it’s true in this case, when I was
in my 20s and 30s, there were simple standards for text, and you could
print documents produced by any writing tool on any printer. And as a
result a wide variety of writing tools and editors were available, and
there was lots of innovation in a very short period of time because
everyone had competition they could learn from and had to keep up with.
Now there’s no reason for Twitter, Facebook, Threads, Instagram,
Bluesky, Mastodon or whatever to improve their editors because after all
you don’t have any choice. That’s another important facet of textcasting
that we borrow from podcasting – lots of ways to create and lots of ways
to listen mean things <i>can</i> get better. With lock-in, they
can’t.</p>

poisoned our minds with the idea that by taking away the basic features
of writing on the web they were encouraging people to write shorter,
better, more to-the-point posts and that would make communication on the
web like poetry. It was a very zen-like mystical idea, and imho totally
wrong. And it’s still repeated as if it were gospel – it’s a typical
response when I beg for a standard that is more realistic, that
incorporates the <a href="http://textcasting.org/">basic features of web
writing</a>: simple styles, links, optional titles, enclosures, the
ability to edit and unlimited length. The fallacy of this response is
that you are free to write however you want, if you feel your ideas are

<h2 id="the-personality-of-a-personal-website">The personality of a
personal website</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-07, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<p>
With his
“<a href="https://robinrendle.com/notes/i-am-a-poem-i-am-not-software/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">I
am a poem I am not software</a>” post
<a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/thoughts/pb-robin-rendle">Robin</a>
touched on an interesting problem related to personal websites. I’m not
going to summarise Robin’s post because his writing is great and you
should read his words on his blog.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
what should our personal websites do? Should we prioritize getting a new
gig or selling a service? Or can we be ourselves? Weird and fun and
peculiar? Should we talk about topic X but avoid topic Y?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
These are all very interesting questions but for me, the more pressing
question is a slightly different one: which <em>you</em> is your
personal site representing? We often don’t pay too much attention to
this but we all have different ways of being ourselves.
</p>
<p>
So which one of these should my site represent? Should my site be the
personal site of the Manu freelance web developer, with his interests in
digital typography, minimal design, and simple websites? Or should
represent the slightly competitive on the basketball court Manu, who
doesn’t really care all that much about winning but is concerned about
having fun? Or maybe it should represent Manu the romantic partner, with
all his worry about the practical aspects of life but also full of
affection for his partner? The list goes on and on.
</p>
<p>
All of these “me” have a different way of communicating because they all
live in different parts of my life. Which one should this site
represent? Hard to say.
</p>
<p>
Personal sites—and, more broadly, our digital lives—are a mirror of who
we are. Some of us will try to neatly organize everything under one
hyper-curated digital roof while others will scatter things around on 12
different domains and 24 services. Some will design a site for
themselves and not touch it again for a decade while others will feel
the need to redesign every 6 months. Those are all right answers to a
question that doesn’t have wrong answers.
</p>
<p>
A personal site is—or at least it should be—a reflection of whoever you
want to be. It could be the complete you, one of the many versions of
you, or even an aspirational you. Just be comfortable in your digital
home. It’s all that matters.

<p>date: 2023-12-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>systemd 255 has been released, and it contains one particular new
feature I want to highlight. A new component “systemd-bsod” has been
added to show logged error messages full-screen if they have a
“LOG_EMERG” log level. This is intended as a tool for displaying
emergency log messages full-screen on boot failures. Yes, BSOD in this
case short for “Blue Screen of Death”. This was worked on as part of
Outreachy 2023. The systemd-bsod will also display a QR code for getting
more information on the error causing the boot failure. ↫ Michael
Larabel at Phoronix I like this. Operating systems usually have
excellent logging capabilities, but getting to these logs and making
sense of them isn’t always easy, especially if you’re not elbow-deep in
the weeds of how your operating system of choice works. Giving a useful
error screen when things really hit a brick wall at 200 km/h is a good
thing, and will make at least some troubleshooting easier.</p>

government is using data from push notifications to track contacts</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>Government investigators in the United States have used push
notification data to pursue people of interest, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.)
said in a letter Wednesday to the Justice Department, revealing for the
first time a way in which Americans can be tracked through a basic
service provided by their smartphones. Wyden’s letter said the Justice
Department had prohibited Apple and Google from discussing the technique
and asked it to change the rule, noting that his office had received a
tip that foreign governments had also begun requesting the
push-notification data. ↫ Drew Harwell for The Washington Post Not
surprising, of course. The one nugget of good news here is that while
Apple’s policy is to hand over this data after a mere subpoena (“privacy
is a fundamental human right“, everybody), Google requires an actual
court order, meaning federal officials must convince a judge of the
validity of the request. Assuming this is not a nebulous secret backroom
deal but a proper judicial process, I’m actually okay with that – law
enforcement does need the ability to investigate potential criminals,
and as long as this happens within the boundaries of the law and
properly overseen and approved by the judiciary every step along the
way, I can support it.</p>

Gemini: Google’s largest and most capable AI model</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>This promise of a world responsibly empowered by AI continues to
drive our work at Google DeepMind. For a long time, we’ve wanted to
build a new generation of AI models, inspired by the way people
understand and interact with the world. AI that feels less like a smart
piece of software and more like something useful and intuitive — an
expert helper or assistant. Today, we’re a step closer to this vision as
we introduce Gemini, the most capable and general model we’ve ever
built. Gemini is the result of large-scale collaborative efforts by
teams across Google, including our colleagues at Google Research. It was
built from the ground up to be multimodal, which means it can generalize
and seamlessly understand, operate across and combine different types of
information including text, code, audio, image and video. ↫ Demis
Hassabis on Google’s official blog It’s no secret I’m not particularly
impressed by “AI”, not least because its ability to autocomplete
complete nonsense based on copyrighted works it’s drawing from without
permission and the dangers this might represent to our society. That
being said, Google’s new “AI” thing, as demonstrated in this video,
actually seems a tiny bit impressive. It still looks like to me like
it’s just blurting out random information using fairly mundane things
like object and speech recognition, but the fluidity of it all
definitely feels a lot more natural than whatever OpenAI and Microsoft
have shown so far. I’m still not even remotely interested in any of this
stuff, but this at least seems slightly more possibly useful than other
examples I’ve seen so far.</p>

<h2
id="discovering-relationships-between-preprints-and-journal-articles">Discovering
relationships between preprints and journal articles</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-07, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<p>
In the scholarly communications environment, the evolution of a journal
article can be traced by the relationships it has with its preprints.
Those preprint–journal article relationships are an important component
of <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/research-nexus/">the
research nexus</a>. Some of those relationships are provided by Crossref
members (including publishers, universities, research groups, funders,
etc.) when they deposit metadata with Crossref, but we know that a
significant number of them are missing. To fill this gap, we developed a
new automated strategy for discovering relationships between preprints
and journal articles and applied it to all the preprints in the Crossref
database. We made the resulting dataset, containing both
publisher-asserted and automatically discovered relationships,
<a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10144856" target="_blank">publicly
available</a> for anyone to analyse.
</p>
<h2 id="tldr">
TL;DR
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
We have developed a new, heuristic-based strategy for matching journal
articles to their preprints. It achieved the following results on the
evaluation dataset: precision 0.99, recall 0.95, F0.5 0.98. The code is
available
<a href="https://gitlab.com/crossref/labs/marple/-/blob/main/strategies_available/preprint_sbmv/strategy.py" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
We applied the strategy to all the preprints in the Crossref database.
It discovered 627K preprint–journal article relationships.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
We gathered all preprint–journal article relationships deposited by
Crossref members, merged them with those discovered by the new strategy,
and made everything available as
<a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10144856" target="_blank">a
dataset</a>. There are 642K relationships in the dataset, including:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
296K provided by the publisher and discovered by the strategy,
</li>
<li>
331K new relationships discovered by the strategy only,
</li>
<li>
15K provided by the publisher only.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>
In the future, we plan to replace our current matching strategy with the
new one and make all discovered relationships available through the
Crossref REST API.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="introduction">
Introduction
</h2>
<p>
Relationships between preprints and journal articles link different
versions of research outputs and allow one to follow the evolution of a
publication over time. The Crossref deposit schema allows Crossref
members to provide these relationships for new publications, either as a
<em>has-preprint</em> relationship deposited with a journal article, or
an <em>is-preprint-of</em> relationship deposited with a preprint.
</p>
<p>
To assist members who deposit preprints, we also try to connect
deposited journal articles with preprints. The current method looks for
an exact match between the title and first authors. We send possible
matches as suggestions to the preprint server, which decides whether to
update the metadata with the relationship.
</p>
<p>
At the time of writing, 137,837 journal articles in the Crossref
database have a <em>has-preprint</em>
relationship<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>,
and 562,225 works of type posted-content (preprints belong to this type)
have an <em>is-preprint-of</em>
relationship<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.
</p>
<p>
We suspected that many preprint–journal article relationships are
missing, as some members inevitably fail to deposit them, even after
suggestions from the current matching strategy. Another factor is that
the current strategy is fairly conservative, and probably misses a
significant number of relationships. For these reasons, we decided to
investigate whether we could improve on the current process. Doing so
would allow us to infer missing relationships on a large scale, similar
to how we automatically match bibliographic references to DOIs.
</p>
<p>
This preprint matching task can be defined in two directions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
We start with a journal article and we want to find all its preprints.
</li>
<li>
We start with a preprint and we want to find a subsequently published
journal article.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
On the one hand, matching from journal articles to preprints would allow
us to enrich the database continually with new relationships, either
periodically or every time new content is added. Since journal articles
tend to appear in the database later than their preprints, it makes
sense for a new journal article to trigger the matching and not the
other way round. This way we can expect the potential matches to be
already in the database at the time of matching.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, matching from preprints to journal articles can be
useful in a situation where we want to add relationships in an existing
database retrospectively. In our case, the database contains many more
journal articles than preprints, so for performance reasons it is better
to start with preprints.
</p>
<p>
In both cases we are dealing with structured matching, meaning that we
match a metadata record of a work (preprint or journal article), rather
than unstructured text.
</p>
<p>
As a result of matching a single preprint or a single journal article,
we should expect zero or more matched journal articles/preprints.
Multiple matches occur when:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
there are multiple versions of the matched preprint and/or
</li>
<li>
matched works have duplicates.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The image shows the result of matching a journal article to two versions
of a preprint:

<h2 id="matching-strategy">
Matching strategy
</h2>
<p>
Our matching strategy uses the following workflow:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Gathering a short list of candidates using the Crossref REST API.
</li>
<li>
Scoring the similarity between the input item and each candidate.
</li>
<li>
A final decision about which candidates, if any, should be returned as
matches.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Gathering candidates is done using the Crossref REST API’s
<em>query.bibliographic</em> parameter. The query is a concatenation of
the title and authors’ last names of the input item. We filter the
candidates based on their type, to leave only preprints or only journal
articles, depending on the direction of the matching. In the future,
instead of getting the candidates from the REST API, we will be using a
dedicated search engine, optimised for preprint matching.
</p>
<p>
Scoring candidates is heuristic-based. Similarities between titles,
authors, and years are scored independently, and the final score is
their average. Titles are compared in a fuzzy way using the
<a href="https://pypi.org/project/rapidfuzz/" target="_blank">rapidfuzz
library</a>. Authors are compared pairwise using the ORCID ID, or
first/last names if ORCID ID is not available. The similarity score
between issued years is 1 if the article was published no earlier than
one year before the preprint and no later than three years after the
preprint, or 0 otherwise.
</p>
<p>
The final decision is made based on two parameters: minimum score and
maximum score difference, both chosen based on a validation dataset. The
following diagram depicts the results of applying these two parameters
in all possible scenarios. First, any candidate scoring below the
minimum score is rejected (grey area in the diagram). Second, the scores
of the remaining candidates are compared with the score of the top
candidate. If the score of a candidate is close enough to the score of
the top candidate, it is returned as a match (blue area).
</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2023/preprint-matching-scenarios.png"
alt="Preprint matching scenarios" width="70%"/>
</figure>
<br/>
<p>
This process can result in the following scenarios:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Scenario A: there is no candidate above the minimum score. This means
nothing matches sufficiently, so nothing is returned.
</li>
<li>
Scenario B: there is only one candidate above the minimum score. This
means it is the best match and we don’t have much of a choice, so it is
returned.
</li>
<li>
Scenario C: there are multiple candidates above the minimum score, and
they all have similar scores. This means they all are similarly good
matches, so all are returned.
</li>
<li>
Scenario D: there are multiple candidates above the minimum score, but
their scores differ a lot. In this case, we don’t want to return all of
them, but only those that are close to the top match. Intuitively, we
don’t want to return less-than-great matches if we have really great
ones. This is when the maximum score difference comes into play: we
return the candidates with the “score distance” to the top candidate
lower than the maximum score difference.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
We evaluated this strategy on a test set sampled from the Crossref
metadata records. The test set contains 3,000 pairs (journal article,
set of corresponding preprints). Half of the journal articles have known
preprints and the other half don’t. The test set can be accessed
<a href="https://gitlab.com/crossref/labs/marple/-/blob/main/data/datasets/preprints-rest-api-2023-06-23.json" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
We used precision, recall, and F0.5 as evaluation metrics:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Precision measures the fraction of the matched relationships that are
correct.
</li>
<li>
Recall measures the fraction of the true relationships that were
matched.
</li>
<li>
F0.5 combines precision and recall in a way that favours precision.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The strategy achieved the following results: precision 0.9921, recall
0.9474, F0.5 0.9828. The average processing time was 0.96s.
</p>
<p>
We have made this strategy (journal article -&gt; preprints) available
through the (experimental) API:
<a href="https://marple.research.crossref.org/match?task=preprint-matching&amp;strategy=preprint-sbmv&amp;input=10.1109/access.2022.3213707" target="_blank">https://marple.research.crossref.org/match?task=preprint-matching&amp;strategy=preprint-sbmv&amp;input=10.1109/access.2022.3213707</a>.
The input is the DOI of a journal article we want to match to preprints,
and the output is a list of matches found, along with the score for
each.
</p>
<p>
We have investigated other approaches to making decisions about which
candidates to return as matches (step 3 above), including using machine
learning. At present none have outperformed the heuristic approach
described above. The heuristic method is also preferred because of its
fast performance.
</p>
<h2 id="preprintjournal-article-relationship-dataset">
Preprint–journal article relationship dataset
</h2>
<p>
We applied the strategy to the entire Crossref database:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
We selected all preprints published until the end of August 2023. This
included only works with type <em>posted-content</em> and subtype
<em>preprint</em>, as reported by the REST API. There were 1,050,247 of
them.
</li>
<li>
We ran the matching strategy (preprint -&gt; journal article) on them.
This resulted in 627,011 preprint–journal article relationships.
</li>
<li>
The resulting relationships were combined with the relationships
deposited by the Crossref members. We included relationships of types
<em>has-preprint</em> or <em>is-preprint-of</em>, where both sides of
the relationship exist in our database, were published until the end of

(type=<em>journal-article</em> for the journal article and

The resulting dataset is a single CSV file with the following fields:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
preprint DOI (string)

journal article DOI (string)
</li>
<li>
whether the publisher of the journal article deposited this relationship

<li>
the confidence score returned by the strategy (float, empty if the
strategy did not discover this relationship)
</li>

<p>
The dataset contains:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
641,950 relationships in total, including 580,532 preprints and 565,129
journal articles,
</li>
<li>
14,939 of them were deposited by the Crossref members, but not
discovered by the strategy,

<li>
330,826 of them were discovered by the strategy, but not provided by any

Conclusions and what’s next
</h2>
<p>
Overall, based on the number of existing and newly discovered
preprint–journal article relationships, it seems that employing
automated matching strategies would approximately double the number of
these relationships in the Crossref database. In the future, we would
like to match new journal articles on an ongoing basis. We also plan to
make all discovered relationships available through the REST API.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, we will be publishing the discovered relationships in
the form of datasets, and we invite anyone interested to further analyse
this data. And if you find out something interesting about preprints and
their relationships, do let us know!

<h2 id="hot-take-on-googles-gemini-and-gpt-4">Hot take on Google’s
Gemini and GPT-4</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-06, from: Gary Marcus blog</p>
<p>Gemini was just announced. Here’s my hot take: Gemini seems to have
by many measures matched (or slightly exceeded) GPT-4, but not to have
blown it away. From a commercial standpoint GPT-4 is no longer unique.
That’s a huge problem for OpenAI, especially post drama, when many
customers are now seeking a backup plan. From a technical standpoint,
the key question is: are LLMs close to a plateau?</p>

<h2 id="one-a-month">One a Month</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-06, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<p>
Over the past 10+ years, I created countless side projects and tried all
sorts of monetization schemes. I tried to sell digital products, I tried
memberships, I tried affiliate links and none ever felt right. Not
saying those methods aren’t right, just saying they don’t feel right to
me.
</p>
<p>
When I started People and Blogs a few months ago I decided I didn’t want
to focus too much on the financial aspects of the project which is why I
set up a simple Ko-Fi account, created three tiers of
memberships/donations, and called it a day.
</p>
<p>
But I recently realized that tiers are the wrong approach. At least for
me. I believe in kindness. I believe that if you decide to support
something I do, you should get all the benefits, no matter how much you
pay.
</p>
<p>
I also realized that 1<span
class="math inline"> + /<em>m</em><em>o</em><em>n</em><em>t</em><em>h</em><em>i</em><em>s</em><em>t</em><em>h</em><em>e</em><em>b</em><em>e</em><em>s</em><em>t</em><em>p</em><em>r</em><em>i</em><em>c</em><em>e</em><em>p</em><em>o</em><em>s</em><em>s</em><em>i</em><em>b</em><em>l</em><em>e</em><em>w</em><em>h</em><em>e</em><em>n</em><em>i</em><em>t</em><em>c</em><em>o</em><em>m</em><em>e</em><em>s</em><em>t</em><em>o</em><em>s</em><em>u</em><em>p</em><em>p</em><em>o</em><em>r</em><em>t</em><em>i</em><em>n</em><em>g</em><em>o</em><em>n</em><em>l</em><em>i</em><em>n</em><em>e</em><em>c</em><em>r</em><em>e</em><em>a</em><em>t</em><em>o</em><em>r</em><em>s</em>.<em>T</em><em>h</em><em>e</em>1</span>
part means you can set it up and forget about it because it’s a low
enough amount that won’t make too much of a difference for the majority
of people who are considering supporting online creators. The + part
allows you to contribute more if you want to do so. And that’s just
perfect.
</p>
<p>
As a result of that I decided to
<a href="https://ko-fi.com/manuelmoreale" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">simplify
my Ko-Fi page</a>. If you like what I’m doing with my various online
projects—this blog,

others. </span></span><span
style="font-family: georgia; font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;">Look
at the web page for google.com. One text box. Type your query, get
useful results. That’s brilliantly simple design and a major reason for
Google’s success. Earlier search engines had much more complicated
interfaces. Today they have either mimicked ours, or feel really hard to
use.</span>

<span class="s1"
style="font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;"><span
style="font-family: georgia;">That’s google.com. But what about what’s
behind it? What about GWS? How you do you invoke it? I looked at the
argument list of a running GWS
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Web_Server" target="_blank">Google
Web Server</a>) instance. XX,XXX characters of configuration flags. XXX
arguments. A few name backend machines. Some configure backends. Some
enable or disable properties. Most of them are probably correct. I

style="font-family: georgia;">So, here’s my question: How can the
company that designed google.com be the same company that designed GWS?
The answer is that GWS configuration structure was not really designed.
It grew organically. Organic growth is not simple; it generates
fantastic complexity. Each piece, each change may be simple, but put
together the complexity becomes overwhelming.</span></span>

<span class="s1"
style="font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;"><span
style="font-family: georgia;">Complexity is multiplicative. In a system,
like Google, that is assembled from components, every time you make one
part more complex, some of the added complexity is reflected in the
other components. It’s complexity runaway.</span></span>

style="font-family: georgia;">Many years ago, Tom Cargill took a year
off from Bell Labs Research to work in development. He joined a group
where every subsystem’s code was printed in a separate binder and stored
on a shelf in each office. Tom discovered that one of those subsystems
was almost completely redundant; most of its services were implemented
elsewhere. So he spent a few months making it completely redundant. He
deleted 15,000 lines of code. When he was done, he removed an entire
binder from everybody’s shelf. He reduced the complexity of the system.
Less code, less to test, less to maintain. His coworkers loved
it.</span></span>

<span class="s1"
style="font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;"><span
style="font-family: georgia;">But there was a catch. During his
performance review, he learned that management had a metric for
productivity: lines of code. Tom had negative productivity. In fact,
because he was so successful, his entire group had negative
productivity. He returned to Research with his tail between his
legs.</span></span>

for all to see, to modify, to improve, to add to. But every time you add
something, you add complexity. Add a new library, you add complexity.
Add a new storage wrapper, you add complexity. Add an option to a
subsystem, you complicate the configuration. And when you complicate
something central, such as a networking library, you complicate
everything.</span></span>

logging system. It’s far from perfect but it was designed to be—and
still is—the only system at Google that solves the particular, central
problem it was designed to solve. Because it is the only one, it
guarantees stability, security, uniformity of use, and all the economies
of scale. There is no way Google would be where it is today if every
team rolled out its own logging infrastructure.</span></span>

<h2 id="nanowrimo-is-disintegrating">NaNoWriMo Is Disintegrating</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-06, from: Jessica Smith’s blog</p>
<p>
One of my guilty pleasures over the past few weeks has been frequenting
the NaNoWriMo forums and reading all the posts about what an unmitigated
clusterfuck that organisation has become.
</p>
<p>
For some background: I first did NaNoWriMo when I had <em>just</em>
turned 13, in 2005. I loved the experience, the encouragement to “just
get it written”, the creative experimentation (I didn’t have a well
thought-out idea going in, so I let the draft take its own direction –
it ended up messy and unsalvageable, but so much fun to write!), and of
course the forums, where I learnt so much about the craft of writing
along with enjoying the more “silly” posts. I did NaNoWriMo every year
up until I finished my bachelor’s degree. After that I got too busy to
do it every year, but I still did it a few times more, most recently
<a href="https://www.jayeless.net/2022/10/nanowrimo-idea.html" title="my blog post from last year where I announced what I planned to do for NaNoWriMo">last
year</a>. I’d chosen to sit this year out before the current storm
broke.
</p>
<p>
So, regardless of me not attempting the challenge this year, I did see

which made a bombshell allegation about the organisation. Specifically,
it’s alleged that an extremely active moderator may have been using her
position to funnel teenagers into an “age play” fetish website she was
heavily involved in, and was also allegedly inviting adults from that
website to interact with teens on the NaNoWriMo forums. The NaNoers who
uncovered this were infuriated by NaNoWriMo HQ’s reaction, which was to
<em>say</em> they’d investigate, and then… do absolutely nothing, at
least outwardly. The moderator was <em>later</em> de-modded, and a few
months later than that banned from the forums, but both those things had
nothing to do with the allegations. (The de-modding was for misusing
moderator powers and the banning was for making threats against HQ’s
hosting contract for their forums on Discourse, iirc.) On top of this,
the fetish website seemed to have caught wind of the allegations too,
because they went dark and started scrubbing <em>their</em> site of
submissions. Did HQ’s investigation amount to nothing more than asking
the moderator, “Hey, did you do this?” That would seem insane, but the
lack of satisfactory response had people
speculating.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In early November, unsatisfied NaNoers sent an email to the
organisation’s Board of Directors detailing the issue. The Board of
Directors moved in and largely shut down the forums, leaving only a
couple of threads open for the specific purpose of communicating with
challenge participants about the issues and the Board’s response. In
fact, as of a day or two ago the forums are now frozen entirely, with
the Board having decided it got too unwieldy to keep up with the two
threads they’d left. And, to be fair, having read
<em><strong>THOUSANDS</strong></em> of posts over the last few weeks
about everything that’s gone wrong… there are a <em>ton</em> of issues
with that organisation, to the point that I’m not sure shutting it all
down is the wrong decision, much as I’m filled with warm fuzzy feelings
for the NaNo I participated in as a teen.
</p>
<p>
The biggest issue, at least to me, is that NaNoWriMo has long had a
toxic attitude of “no one can be excluded” and “everyone has a story to
tell”. One haunting example of the way this played out in practice was
detailed by a former <abbr title="Municipal Liaison">ML</abbr> (that’s a
volunteer who, among other things, organises in-person meet-ups in their
local region) in

which I’m going to quote below because I believe that link requires you
to be logged in to view it:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
In 2012 (might have been 2011) I had an adult participant explain the
explicit omegaverse erotica that she was writing to a 14 year old. She
then left her laptop open to go and get a drink, with the instruction
“i’m not telling you to read it, but I’m not <em>not</em> telling you
that, and if I just leave my laptop open and you <em>happen</em> to see
it, there’s nothing wrong with that, is there?”
</p>
<p>
The teenager approached me before NaNo the next year and told me about
this. She said that it made her extremely uncomfortable and that the
adult participant had spent a lot of time telling her how clever she
(the teen) was, how she was more mature than other teens, and how other
adults just didn’t understand. Which is all classic grooming. The teen
asked if this person was going to be at events that year, because she
didn’t want to see her again.
</p>
<p>
I contacted HQ (I think it would have been Paige Knorr back then?) with
this, and asked if they would back me up if I told this person that they
were no longer welcome at our events.
</p>
<p>
The response I got was that not only would they not back me up, I was
<em>not allowed</em> to ban this person from our events because they had
to be held in a public space and be open to <em>anyone</em> who wanted
to come and write.
</p>
<p>
She came back, the teenager never came to another in-person event.
</p>
<p>
The adult in question came back, and that year groomed and sexually
assaulted a 17-year-old who she met at our events. I didn’t learn about
this until several months afterwards. I once again contacted HQ, and was
told that I still couldn’t ask her to stay away from our region because
the incident took place <em>after</em> our event and we weren’t allowed
to ban people based on behaviour outside the scope of our events (sound
familiar, anyone?).
</p>
<p>
I then posed the question:
</p>
<p>
If the abusive ex of one of our wrimos turned up at an event, with the
apparent intent to write with us, could I ask <em>them</em> to leave?
</p>
<p>
Once again the answer was no, unless there was evidence of a police
report, or the ex became abusive <em>during the event</em>. It was
heavily implied that the victim ought to leave if they were
uncomfortable.
</p>
<p>
I was 22, I had no training in how to handle this kind of thing, and I
received the <em>opposite</em> of support. Having heard stories from
other MLs I am convinced that the only reason I was not removed from the
position is that I chose not to fight them.
</p>
<p>
I still, and probably always will, regret trusting HQ in that matter
instead of my own instincts. <em>A teenager was abused</em> because I
trusted them, and not myself.

In the last few days before the forum closure, there had been <strong>so
many</strong> complaints about the way the
<abbr title="Municipal Liaison">ML</abbr> program had been run. A number
of <abbr title="Municipal Liaisons">MLs</abbr> said that NaNoWriMo HQ
gave them pretty much no support, basically just some free stickers. If
you believe the account of the volunteer I quoted, they admonished
<abbr title="Municipal Liaisons">MLs</abbr> to allow predators at
events. Others reported that HQ didn’t really care if
<abbr title="Municipal Liaisons">MLs</abbr> were themselves bullies or
harassers, either. My own region, Melbourne, had <strong>no</strong>
<abbr title="Municipal Liaisons">MLs</abbr> this year because one of the
three there had been alleged that another one bullied them, and rather
than trying to get to the bottom of the issue, NaNoWriMo HQ just removed
them both for being unable to get along. Then a few days before
November, they removed the last one left for taking sides in that
conflict. A number of other <abbr title="Municipal Liaisons">MLs</abbr>
and ex-<abbr title="Municipal Liaisons">MLs</abbr>, from different
regions, reported that this was HQ’s standard strategy for dealing with
reports of inter-<abbr title="Municipal Liaison">ML</abbr> bullying: to
tell the victim, “Just get along, and if you can’t, we’ll remove you.”
</p>
<p>
To be fair, the coordinator of the
<abbr title="Municipal Liaison">ML</abbr> program has something like 800
<abbr title="Municipal Liaisons">MLs</abbr> to try to manage, which is
probably beyond the ability of a single person. However, this is
<em>another</em> complaint: the organisation’s resources are laughably
inadequate for everything they want to do. They have something like
eight employees, many of which are not even full-time, and are
<em>absolutely dependent</em> on volunteer labour –
<abbr title="Municipal Liaisons">MLs</abbr> and forum moderators – for
their core programs. The Board hinted, in one of their posts in the last
few weeks, that they might just shut the forum and <em>only</em> have
the <abbr title="Municipal Liaison">ML</abbr> program, as a better use
of limited resources. This made quite a lot of NaNoers pretty mad,
because while the forum needs a lot more moderators than the 10 or so
that HQ has, from ~2019 till now, been willing to have, it probably
doesn’t need <em>eight hundred</em>. And if the concern is that the
forums are unsafe for minors, well, the reason why the
<abbr title="Municipal Liaison">ML</abbr> I quoted shared her story was
to point out that HQ can’t guarantee – and didn’t seem like they cared
too much about – minors’ safety at in-person gatherings either.
</p>
<p>
Another issue with the <abbr title="Municipal Liaison">ML</abbr> program
has been the “unofficially official” Discord that the NaNoWriMo HQ uses
to communicate with <abbr title="Municipal Liaisons">MLs</abbr>. Because
it’s “unofficial”, <abbr title="Municipal Liaisons">MLs</abbr> aren’t
actually required to be members of it, and the Discord admin (who is not
affiliated with HQ, because like I said, “unofficial”) is able to throw
her weight around and bully <abbr title="Municipal Liaisons">MLs</abbr>
who don’t adhere to the culture she’s decided she wants there, which is
one of toxic positivity, arse-kissing of HQ, and sharing screenshots to
mock ordinary NaNo participants who have criticisms of the way the
organisation’s been doing things. (Apparently open transphobia is
acceptable, though.) <strong>However</strong>, this Discord has become
literally the only place <abbr title="Municipal Liaisons">MLs</abbr> can
ask questions of the <abbr title="Municipal Liaison">ML</abbr> program
coordinator and have them answered in any kind of timely fashion.
Apparently she’s glacially slow replying to emails. She also forgets to
post updates in the dedicated subforum that’s supposed to be used to
share info with <abbr title="Municipal Liaisons">MLs</abbr>, so being a
member of the Discord is basically required for
<abbr title="Municipal Liaisons">MLs</abbr> who want to stay up-to-date
with wtf is going on.
</p>
<p>
But with all of that said, the bulk of the complaints have been to do
with the mismanagement and poor moderation of the forum. The NaNoWriMo
forums have one paid “lead moderator” – which is only a part-time
position – and a number of volunteer moderators. Apparently they lost a
huge number of volunteer moderators when they migrated from their own
bespoke software to Discourse in 2019, and they’ve just… not replaced
them. Or not at anywhere a 1:1 ratio. There was a comment somewhere that
they couldn’t take on more volunteer moderators because they give each
of them a $100 gift card each year as a thank-you, and the budget only
extends to ten gift cards, an explanation which
<strong>exasperated</strong> the people who were adamant they’d
volunteer to help moderate if it’d get the forums back on track, and
they didn’t care about damn gift cards. So anyway, because of the dire
shortage of moderators, what moderation there <em>has</em> been has been
inconsistent, heavy-handed against critics of the organisation, and way
too permissive of a certain contingent who’ve allegedly been posting
homophobic and transphobic bullshit, along with loads of Bible quotes
and “Christian only” threads to try to make non-Christian users feel
unwelcome.
</p>
<p>
Like I said, I’ve read thousands of posts, and there have been loads of
controversies. One of the biggest (aside from the current “moderator may
have been luring teens to a fetish site” one) involved an active,
high-profile moderator (and the former lead moderator) stepping down
after it was revealed she’d made a racist comment about the <em>new</em>
lead moderator. People were angry about the racism, but also angry that
the context indicated there was a broader culture of racism at NaNoWriMo
HQ that was going unaddressed in favour of offering up “the one who got
caught” as a sacrificial lamb. (btw, the Black lead moderator was
abruptly placed on “administrative leave” about a month later.) Another
huge incident occurred around the time of last year’s NaNoWriMo
challenge, when the organisation accepted a sponsorship from

NaNo participants tried to raise the alarm, and found their posts
heavily suppressed and hidden from public view. NaNo actually issued an
apology <em>to Inkitt</em> before the backlash became so huge that they
were forced into an about-face. A moderator was let go. While the
userbase “won” this time, this pretty much set the template for how HQ
would react to every controversy thereafter: with heavy-handed silencing
and, often, unprofessional arguing with users. This was also their
initial response to the current controversy over minors being groomed on
their site, before the Board stepped in.
</p>
<p>
I think the Inkitt deal is symptomatic of a broader shift in NaNoWriMo
the organisation’s sense of purpose: where once they saw it as their
primary mission to run an annual novel-writing challenge, now they see
it as their primary mission to solicit donations. I’m sure everyone else
who’s got NaNoWriMo emails in their inbox for years on end, like I have,
has noticed the transition over time. Where once HQ sent out whimsical
“pep talks”, now they just send out endless requests for me to give them
money. Sometimes this is under the guise of requesting me to buy merch
from their store (extremely <em>expensive</em> merch where the shipping
costs as much as the products themselves
somehow!)<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>,
and other times it’s tone-deaf demands for cash money. “A donation as
small as $25…” Like seriously, you think I’m giving AUD$42 to a silly
writing challenge? There was even a much-panned slideshow that got
leaked where NaNoWriMo HQ were strategising about how they could
convince people living below the poverty line to donate to their
organisation.
</p>
<p>
So how much money does NaNoWriMo bring in, and where does it all go?
Well, they’re a registered not-for-profit in the US, so a certain amount
is public knowledge.

in the last financial year, they took in US$1,158,793 in total revenue,
of which they spent $902,164 on employee compensation. <em>All</em>
their other expenses put together were less than half that, at $437,577.
Their “information technology” expenses – which I assume includes what I
think of as their core task, running the website and forums – were
$49,087. The vast majority of their revenue ($859,397) came from
donations, with most of the remainder ($255,749) coming from merchandise
sales, and a curious $36,646 from “affiliate fees”. The organisation
doesn’t seem to get any grants or anything, it’s mostly all just
donations and merch sales. Which I guess helps to explain the aggressive
email campaigns. I swear, over the first weekend of November
<em>alone</em>, I got more than a dozen emails from them begging for
money.
</p>
<p>
So: where to for NaNoWriMo next? The sad truth is, I find it hard to see
how <em>any</em> of this situation is salvageable. People were quipping
about how NaNoWriMo without the forums (which the Board seems to want to
dump) and the <abbr title="Municipal Liaison">ML</abbr> program (which
seems especially unsalvageable) is basically just “a hashtag and a
coupon”, and that’s about the sum of it. The Board of Directors has
stepped in now to save the organisation, but I’m just asking myself
what’s left that’s worth saving. The <em>organisation</em> doesn’t need
to exist for people to challenge themselves to write 50,000 words in
November, or track their word counts, or talk to other writers online,
or to meet with other writers in their local area. Dare I say that other
spaces where writers congregate are likely to have healthier cultures
and saner rules than “well, so long this person didn’t perpetrate their
sexual assault of a teen <em>actually at</em> the NaNoWriMo event, you
can’t ban them from any future ones”. Perhaps the collapse of NaNoWriMo
as a not-for-profit, and future existence as an idea (and a hashtag),
would actually be best for it. The whimsy and fun of the challenge
didn’t come from HQ (well, the founders might have set the tone, but
then they moved on); it was the participants who made that, and the
participants can again, with safe and encouraging spaces to congregate.
Volunteers were running such spaces on behalf of HQ anyway, and their
work might actually become <em>easier</em> without all the overhead of
HQ’s bad choices.
</p>
<p>
Now, you might well point out that if NaNoWriMo can’t guarantee minors’
safety on their own website (and the dedicated
<abbr title="Young Writers Program">YWP</abbr> website has its own
multitude of
issues<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>),
they’re not going to be any <em>better</em> at guaranteeing it if
participants scatter to the four winds. And I mean, this is true, but
the truth is that <em>no space</em> can be 100% guaranteed to be safe
for young people – not even with compulsory background checks for
volunteers, because so many creeps fly under the radar of the
authorities – and with all the stories coming out over the last few
weeks, you’d be hard-pressed to say NaNoWriMo has made an absolute
best-faith effort. There must be other writing communities on the
internet doing a better job. I also think, <em>along with</em> forum
admins &amp; moderators making those best-faith efforts, kids themselves
have to be educated about internet safety, and really should have
trusted adults IRL (preferably their parents) that they can use as a
sounding board when things feel off and they need guidance. I know not
all kids have parents who can be reasoned with, and I think this has
been a particular problem for the NaNoWriMo site – it seems to have a
relatively large contingent of teenage users who aren’t really allowed
on social media, but their parents let them go on NaNoWriMo because they
think it’s an educational site. I don’t think there are any easy answers
for those kids, unfortunately.
</p>
<p>
While no one – not even the Board at this stage – knows what NaNoWriMo’s
going to look like in 2024 and beyond, it really feels like this is the
end of the road for NaNoWriMo as we’ve known it. If the organisation
itself survives, it seems clear that there’ll be a lot of drastic
changes between this year and the next, and that’s a big “if” in the
first place. Of course, you can write and indulge your creativity
without a specific challenge to complete 50,000 words in November… but
there’s a reason so many of us <em>have</em> taken part in the challenge
and look back on it with fondness. It’s a crying shame that it’s come to
this. But we don’t <em>need</em> NaNoWriMo to be enthusiastic about our
writing and share in that creative joy together. And certainly, as far
as the official organisation behind the challenge is concerned, it seems
like time to let it go.

<p>Windows 10’s end-of-support date is October 14, 2025. That’s the day
that most Windows 10 PCs will receive their last security update and the
date when most people should find a way to move to Windows 11 to ensure
that they stay secure. As it has done for other stubbornly popular
versions of Windows, though, Microsoft is offering a reprieve for those
who want or need to stay on Windows 10: three additional years of
security updates, provided to those who can pay for the Extended
Security Updates (ESU) program. ↫ Andrew Cunningham for Ars Technica
Getting users to upgrade from Windows 10 to 11 at that point isn’t going
to be easy, because at this point Windows 10 users who can technically
upgrade are clearly not doing so for a reason. I also wonder what this
will mean for the large number of Windows 10 users who simply cannot
upgrade because they have a processor that’s artificially restricted
from running Windows 11.</p>

<p>date: 2023-12-06, from: OS News</p>
<p>A somewhat obscure guideline for developers of U.S. government
websites may be about to accelerate the long, sad decline of Mozilla’s
Firefox browser. There already are plenty of large entities, both public
and private, whose websites lack proper support for Firefox; and that
will get only worse in the near future, because the ’fox’s auburn paws
are perilously close to the lip of the proverbial slippery slope. ↫
Bryce Wray US government guidelines say that US government websites only
need to be tested on browsers with more than 2% market share – and
Firefox is getting perilously close to that threshold. While it won’t
kill Firefox overnight, it would definitely make Firefox progressively
more cumbersome to use for American users, and could have ripple effects
elsewhere.</p>

trademark actions that were taken by Fundación PostgreSQL.
</p>
<p>
On November 17, 2023, the PostgreSQL Community Association, PostgreSQL
Europe, and Fundación PostgreSQL reached a settlement on all outstanding
trademark issues. Fundación PostgreSQL has surrendered all trademarks
and entered into a trademark license with the PostgreSQL Community
Association.

All three organizations are pleased to have reached an amicable
resolution, and all will continue to work on activities to help grow the
PostgreSQL community.

<p>Intel’s Optane memory modules launched with a lot of fanfare in 2015,
and were recently discontinued, in 2022, with similar fanfare. It was a
sad day for me, a lover of abstraction-breaking technologies, but it was
forseeable and understandable. At the time of Optane’s launch, a lot of
us were excited about the idea of having a new storage tier, sitting
between DRAM and flash. It was announced as having DRAM endurance and
speed with the persistence and size of flash. It was a futuristic memory
technology, but the technology of the future met the full force of
Wright’s Law. ↫ Nima Badizadegan I definitely remember Optane being
presented as a huge deal, but it seems it fell between the cracks of
other technologies developing around it and their prices dropping
fast.</p>

<p>date: 2023-12-05, updated: 2023-12-05, from: Anthony Bucci blog</p>
<p>In the flurry of text that text-generating large language models
(LLMs) like ChatGPT have induced people to generate, a number of
analogies have arisen to help make sense of what exactly these things
do. Like most metaphors, some work better than others and none really
suffice. This post is about viewing LLMs as “word calculators”, in other
words tools that allow us to work with language in a way analogous to
how calculators allow us to work with math.</p>

<h2 id="the-hidden-secrets-of-the-fn-key-on-the-mac">The hidden secrets
of the Fn key on the Mac</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>Even if you’ve used the Mac for decades, I suspect you have never
fully understood the Fn key. Not helping is the fact that Apple
sometimes calls it the Function key, but all Mac keyboards already have
12 or more numbered F-for-Function keys! The Fn key first appeared in
1998 in the PowerBook G3 Series (Wallstreet) and has become a fixture in
the lower-left corner of laptop keyboards ever since. The Fn key
migrated to standalone keyboards only in 2007 with the release of the
Apple Keyboard with Numeric Keypad, where it occupies a spot between the
Delete key and the Home key. On Apple’s compact desktop keyboards, it
reverts to the lower-left corner. ↫ Adam Engst at TibBITS This article
made me wonder when the Fn key first appeared, but searching for it
leads to a lot of SEO spam that is clearly all wrong. As the article
notes, Apple first introduced it in 1998, and IBM already it in on the
monochrome ThinkPad 300 in 1992. It’s much older than that, though; the
IBM PC Convertible from 1986 also had one, as did the IBM PCjr from
1984. At this point I’m starting to think it was actually a fairly
common key, but with the explosion of IBM compatibles in the early ’80s
it’s basically impossible to check them all, and, of course, there’s the
possibility it may have existed on earlier systems, or third-party
keyboards long lost to time. This would be an interesting mystery to
solve.</p>

id="perspectives-madhura-amdekar-on-meeting-the-community-and-pursuing-passion-for-research-integrity">Perspectives:
Madhura Amdekar on meeting the community and pursuing passion for
research integrity</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-05, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<div style="float:left;margin:10px">
<p><img src="https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2022/perspectives.png" alt="sound bar logo" width="150px" class="img-responsive" /></p>
</div>
<p>
The second half of 2023 brought with itself a couple of big life changes
for me: not only did I move to the Netherlands from India, I also
started a new and exciting job at Crossref as the newest Community
Engagement Manager. In this role, I am a part of the Community
Engagement and Communications team, and my key responsibility is to
engage with the global community of scholarly editors, publishers, and
editorial organisations to develop sustained programs that help editors
to leverage rich metadata.
</p>
<p>
This represents an exciting phase in my professional journey, as I now
have the chance to learn and develop new skills, broaden my
understanding of the publishing landscape, and at the same time be able
to leverage the experience I gained so far. I originally trained as an
ecologist, obtaining a PhD studying colour change in a tropical agamid
lizard in India at the
<a href="https://iisc.ac.in/" target="_blank">Indian Institute of
Science</a> (Bengaluru, India). Having immensely enjoyed the process of
writing manuscripts based on the data that resulted from my PhD thesis,
I was drawn to working in the scholarly publishing industry. I worked
for 3.5 years as a Senior Associate at Wiley, overseeing an editor
support service by devising strategic scale-up planning and process
improvement initiatives.
</p>
<p>
I then moved countries as well as jobs and joined Crossref. The world of
scholarly communications is a rapidly changing ecosystem, that is ably
supported by scholarly infrastructure - the sets of tools and services
that support this industry. Being a part of Crossref, a global
organisation that provides open scholarly infrastructure, allows me to
work with and make an impact on the broad scholarly community that
ranges from publishers of all shapes and sizes, funders, to academic
institutions, and researchers.
</p>
<p>
So far, the
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/categories/research-integrity/">integrity
of the scholarly record (ISR)</a> has been the focus of my work. Now
more than ever, the community is cognizant of the need to uphold the
integrity of the scholarly output. Metadata and relationships between
research outputs can support this endeavour in a substantial manner
because information such as who contributed to a research output, who
funded it, who cites it, whether it was updated after publication, aids
provenance and provides signals about whether the output is trustworthy.
</p>
<p>
Most of Crossref’s tools and services play a key role here: be it
reference linking to allow researchers to increase discoverability of
their work, tracking post-publication updates to research outputs via
Crossmark, or detecting text plagiarism via Similarity Check. We noticed
that not all editors and editorial teams associate metadata as signals
of integrity, and might be unaware of the benefits of rich metadata.
Therefore, my priority is to utilise opportunities to engage with
editors about how metadata can provide trust indicators about a research
output. I aim to empower editors to collect and leverage rich metadata.
</p>
<p>
While I am no stranger to the world of scholarly communications,
engaging with the broader Crossref community has been a new experience
for me. In my day to day work, I employ a range of different skills such
as program design and management, content planning and outreach,
networking, and meeting facilitation. I have also been participating in
trainings to enhance my skill set – I recently completed a training
course on
<a href="https://www.cscce.org/trainings/cef/" target="_blank">Community
Engagement Fundamentals</a>, which has equipped me with a better
understanding of the concepts and strategies that I will need as a
community manager. Additionally, I also underwent the Group Facilitation
Methods training course led by the Institute of Cultural Affairs (ICA)
where I learnt a couple of effective methods for group facilitation and
leading workshops.
</p>
<p>
Equipped with these skills, I have moderated a few community events
already – most prominently
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5VBUWz8KZY" target="_blank">the
community call about Crossref and Retraction Watch</a> to discuss
Crossref’s acquisition and opening up of the Retraction Watch database.
It was a valuable experience to contribute to the planning of an online
event and host a panel of distinguished guests.
</p>
<p>
I was also fortunate to be able to meet our community members in-person:
I supported the organisation of the Frankfurt roundtable event that was
held as part of Crossref’s Integrity of the Scholarly Record (ISR)
program, where we engaged with community members to get their
perspectives on how to work together towards preserving the integrity of
the scholarly record (keep watching this space for a forthcoming blog
summarising the outcomes from this event!). Additionally, I attended the
Frankfurt Book Fair – the experience of getting to meet our members and
to hear from them first-hand about all things Crossref, was
unparalleled! I used this opportunity to meet several of our publisher
members and discuss their view points about engaging with editors on
ISR. The idea was received positively: we heard specific suggestions of
metadata that would be of interest to readers of scientific manuscripts,
and our members also expressed interest in finding out more about how
metadata can act as markers of trust for a research output. I plan to
use the insights from these meetings for the development of the ISR
editor engagement program.
</p>
<p>
As I reflect on the past three months, there are a few things that have
stood out to me. In terms of work, no two days are the same. My work
plan for the day can range from making presentations for outreach
activities, creating content such as this blogpost, working on an
engagement strategy, to planning events, attending online or offline
community meetings, facilitating or moderating some of those events, and
networking with community members. This variety in work keeps me
motivated to give my best each day. I am also grateful that I have the
ability to make an impact with my work in an area that I am passionate
about. In my previous job, I had developed a good understanding of
research integrity and publication ethics. As a community manager now,
I’m looking to work with editorial teams on the integrity of the
scholarly record. This role gives me an opportunity to further nurture
this interest of mine.
</p>
<p>
At times, working from home remotely has been a challenge. However, I
have enjoyed attending in-person events as they are not just a chance to
meet our community members, but also a chance to meet my colleagues and
connect with them.
</p>
<p>
I feel privileged to be able to connect with research communities all
over the world and make a meaningful contribution towards supporting the
discoverability and impact of their work. I am particularly excited to
work at the forefront of shaping the future of preserving the integrity
of the scholarly record, in tandem with our community. If this is a
topic that excites you as well, I am keen to hear from you. It has been
a wonderful three months at Crossref so far and I look forward to future
collaborations with our community to develop effective ways of
supporting and empowering editors to make the most of metadata for their
publications.

<h2 id="pg_dbms_lock-v1.0-released">pg_dbms_lock v1.0 released</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-05, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
Toronto, Canada - December 03, 2023
</p>
<h2>
PostgreSQL pg_dbms_lock extension
</h2>
<p>
This PostgreSQL extension provided compatibility with the DBMS_LOCK
Oracle package except the <code>DBMS_LOCK.CONVERT()</code> function and
some unsupported lock modes who anyway are rarely found in the Oracle
PL/SQL stored procedures.
</p>
<p>
The following stored procedures are implemented:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>ALLOCATE_UNIQUE()</code>: Allocates a unique lock ID to a named
lock.
</li>
<li>
<code>REQUEST()</code>: Requests a lock of a specific mode.
</li>
<li>
<code>RELEASE()</code>: Releases a lock.
</li>
<li>
<code>SLEEP()</code>: Puts a procedure to sleep for a specific time.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
For instance, user locks can be used to do the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Provide exclusive access to an external device or service (like a
printer).
</li>
<li>
Coordinate or synchronize parallelized applications.
</li>
<li>
Disable or enable execution of programs at specific times.
</li>
<li>
Detect whether a session has ended a transaction using COMMIT or
ROLLBACK.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is the initial release of this exention.

<h2 id="stateless-postgres-query-router-1.0.0-released">Stateless
Postgres Query Router 1.0.0 released</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-05, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
The SPQR team is proud to release the first production-ready version of
the SPQR (Stateless Postgres Query Router).
</p>
<p>
SPQR is a query router for horizontal scaling of PostgreSQL via
sharding. SPQR is designed to be as lightweight as a connection pooler,
reducing knowledge of the data schema to the necessary minimum.
</p>
<h2>
Main features
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Sharding</strong>. If possible, the router determines a shard
from the first statement of a transaction and keeps client bound to that
shard until transaction ends. But you can explicitly specify a shard or
a
<a href="https://github.com/pg-sharding/spqr/blob/master/test/regress/tests/router/expected/routing_hint.out#L30">sharding
key</a> in a comment request.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Transaction and session pooling</strong>. Just as in your
favorite connection pooler (Odyssey or PgBouncer).
</li>
<li>
<strong>Multiple routers for fault tolerance</strong>. The router stores
the sharding rules only for cache purposes. Information about the entire
installation is stored inside the QDB service, so the number of routers
running simultaneously is unlimited.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Shard rebalancing</strong>. Data migration between shards aims
to balance the workload across shards proportionally. The main idea is
to minimize any locking impact during these migrations, which is
accomplished by reducing the size of the data ranges being transferred.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Multiple servers and failover</strong>. In the router
configuration, it is possible to specify multiple servers for one shard.
Then the router will distribute read-only queries among the replicas.
However, in addition to the automatic routing, you also have the option
to explicitly define the destination for a specific query by using the
target-session-attr parameter within the query.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Minor overhead for query execution</strong>. See benchmarks
<a href="https://github.com/pg-sharding/spqr/blob/master/docs/Benchmarks.md">here</a>
and
<a href="https://gitlab.com/postgres-ai/postgresql-consulting/tests-and-benchmarks/-/issues/30">here</a>.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
Status of the project
</h2>
<p>
Essential set of features of the SPQR is used in production. But
automatic shard rebalancing is not production ready yet. Also, SPQR
supports some cross-shard queries, but they have inconsistent snapshot
and are not 2PC-locked to provide true cross-shard atomicity.
</p>
<p>
Currently, the project is being maintained by Yandex Cloud. However, we
are looking for new architects and contributors to broaden our technical
views. As always, any feedback is welcome.

<h2 id="macos-sonoma-is-setting-records-for-update-size">macOS Sonoma is
setting records for update size</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-04, from: OS News</p>
<p>It was Big Sur that focussed attention on the size of macOS updates.
In Mojave and earlier, updates had essentially been Installer packages
that brought a minimum of overhead. By the time that many had installed
Big Sur’s new Signed System Volume (SSV), we were starting to discover
just how large its updates were. Those were early days with its
completely new updating process that builds a new System volume, takes a
snapshot of it, and constructs a tree of hashes that verify the
integrity of every last bit within it. ↫ Howard Oakley I had no idea
macOS updates had become as big as they had, and good on Apple for
trying to bring this back down again, and speed up installation of
updates, too.</p>

with your wallet” is such an empty platitude, usually used by
corporatists trying to absolve corporations from misdeeds and shifting

<p>Early language acquisition students, at the elementary and middle
school levels, can see a problem with the language invisible to those of
us who are old, incurious, and set in our ways: The language contains
synonyms. These excess words which ancestors have failed to prune
represent the lack of insight and care that characterizes the older
generation which cares only about unscrutinized tradition with no regard
for the amount of labor that the legacy places, unwanted, upon the
people of today.</p>

back in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/">Wordle</a>
groove, having done the last 42 puzzles without missing one. I think I
understand the game much better now. I do sometimes make mistakes, and
always pay for them. The thing that keeps me coming back is the feeling
when you press Return to see the result of your first guess. It’s like
opening a present, only better. If you get two green tiles, you can bask
in the glow of being extremely lucky. If you guess well you usually can
solve the puzzle in three or at most four moves. I’ve never gotten it in
two, and I don’t usually try, and when I do it’s usually a mistake, I
would have done better to stick with the plan of eliminating a bunch of
letters and confirming others, and then go for solution in the third
round. But the thing that keeps me coming back is the feeling of getting
a really good present, and that feeling of fortune and a bit of love,
self-love, when you see the answer, decide to go for it, and see five
green tiles open up
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbK1SM_Qomg">one at a time</a>.
That’s the feeling that keeps me coming back day after day.</p>

<h2 id="running-a-macbook-pro-with-debian">Running a MacBook Pro with
Debian</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-04, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
Running a MacBook Pro with Debian
</h1>
<p>
Two days ago my
<a href="2018-06-08_Librem_13_by_Purism_Mini_Review">Purism laptop</a>
stopped working: As soon as the boot process tried to access the SDD, it
would shut down.
</p>
<p>
I started wondering about bringing the old MacBook Pro back to life. We
had stopped using it after my wife bought a new Mac. This seemed like
the best solution at the time. She only wanted a system where there was
at least a chance of getting decent support from friends or shops,
i.e. Windows or macOS. And we didn’t want to continue using the MacBook
Pro because Apple had decided to no longer support those machines with
macOS updates.
</p>
<p>
I always felt bad about having a perfectly usable laptop sitting around
that I had used myself for so long before buying the Purism laptop. But
now that the Purism laptop was out of order and my wife had moved to a
new laptop, I started wondering about installing Debian on the MacBook
Pro.
</p>
<p>
<a class="account" href="https://weirder.earth/@j12i" title="@j12i@weirder.earth"><span
class="citation" data-cites="j12i">@j12i</span></a> suggested that I
might just try to plug the USB stick with the Debian installer into the
Mac since the chip architecture was compatible. I tried that, and it
worked!
</p>
<p>
Then
<a class="account" href="https://weirder.earth/@j12i" title="@j12i@weirder.earth"><span
class="citation" data-cites="j12i">@j12i</span></a> had an even strange
idea:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
If it physically fits, you could even try the drive from the librem in
the macbook. Should only need fixing up the bootloader, if at all.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
And so it was!
</p>
<p>
The SDD plugged into the MacBook Pro was mounted correctly by the rescue
system on the stick. I reinstalled GRUB on /dev/sda and after a reboot I
was running Debian on the MacBook Pro!
</p>
<p>
Everything seems a bit slow, but this is definitely workable. What a
great idea!
</p>
<p>
I installed <code>firmware-b43-installer</code> in order to get the
wireless card to run. The wireless card is a BCM4322 802.11a/b/g/n
Wireless LAN Controller (rev 01). Broadcom is such a sadface.
</p>
<p>
I decided that perhaps Gnome was slow and I should go and try sway
again. I installed <code>gpomme</code> for the Apple hotkeys (change
display brightness, change volume) but then I couldn’t get the trackpad
to invert the y-axis and I’m back to Gnome…
</p>
<p>
A bit later, I figured that perhaps the input source detection wasn’t
working so I mashed it all together, and now it works!
</p>
<pre><code>input * {
    dwt enabled
    tap enabled
    natural_scroll enabled
    middle_emulation disabled
    xkb_layout us
    xkb_variant altgr-intl
    xkb_options compose:caps
}
</code></pre>
<p>
It’s still looking good. The camera seems to be working, too.
</p>

<a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Apple">#Apple</a>
<a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Mac">#Mac</a>
</p>
<p>
<strong>2023-12-03</strong> Fixed the Purism laptop issue, switched the
drives back, and things still work. So for the moment the MacBook Pro is
back on the shelf. It’s just nice to know that I have a working backup
laptop should the need arise.
</p>
<p>
And I noticed a few things, too:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
I like how the keyboard just works
</li>
<li>
I have a problem with the bottom left corner arrangement of fn ctrl alt
gui aka. Function Control Option and Command
</li>
<li>
I like that the laptop has an ethernet plug
</li>
<li>
I like that the laptop has a CD/DVD reader
</li>
</ul>

native English speakers, applying for a subject at a top university in

brand new BeOS, Mac OS X, and MS-DOS T-shirts in the OSNews Merch
Store!</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>The holidays are coming, there’s a chill in the air (literally for
me, I live in the Arctic), so it’s time for a few new additions to the
official OSNews Merch Store. Do you live in the terminal, breathe the
terminal? We’ve got new shirts just for you. The opening message of the
terminals of Mac OS X, BeOS, and MS-DOS (let’s be generous and call
MS-DOS a terminal), with a command to call an osnews directory on the
file system, printed on the front of the shirt. They sport the correct
fonts, background colours, and exact verbiage used in the operating
systems themselves. For the Mac OS X one, I had to choose a last login
date and a username, so I opted for the exact time and date of birth of
my oldest son, and a username that’s a bit of an Easter egg. These
shirts of the organic cotton variety, and all proceeds go to supporting
OSNews’ continued existence so we don’t have to resort to SEO crap,
“AI”-generated garbage, and malvertising. Every item sold on the store
generates around $10 for us, with the rest going to our partner Bonfire
for producing the items and running the store. You can also support
OSNews through individual donations on Ko-Fi, by becoming a Patreon, and
by supporting us through LiberaPay.</p>

<h2 id="finally-proper-attribution">Finally: proper attribution</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>You may have noticed that starting today, I’ve been adding a
dedicated link to the main story in every post on OSNews. Our
old-fashioned 2001 method of “biggest link is main story” simply doesn’t
hold up today as proper attribution, so from here on out every post will
have a link marked by ↫ crediting the name and/or publication of the
main linked article (or multiple where it makes sense). I’ve been
unhappy with our attribution for years, and finally got my act together
and settled on this solution. While I’ve had, in total, maybe no more
than 2-3 complaints about this since I started in 2006 – it’s taken too
long, and I apologise for that. Credit and attribution matter. For the
curious: ↫ is part of the arrows Unicode block as U+21AB, titled
“Leftwards arrow with loop”. I settled on it because the path of the
loop and the arrow evoked a feeling of being yoinked back somewhere
else, and that’s what a link does. Sure, I could’ve opted for a chain
link or whatever, but that’s boring.</p>

<p>date: 2023-12-03, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
“Fediverse” is another kind of silo.
</p>
<p>
Our social media apps should be rising up out of feeds to interop with
each other now, not sometime in the future.
</p>
<p>
By then Facebook (or Meta or Threads) will own us as much as Twitter
did.

<p>date: 2023-12-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>I was always very interested in OpenBSD and a few months ago, I
decided to give it a try. I’ve quickly fallen in love with it! There is,
however, a big problem: Hare does not fully support OpenBSD! So, I
decided to port it and I am happy to announce that my work was merged
yesterday and OpenBSD is now fully supported by Hare. Let me show you
some of the tricky stuff that was involved in the port. ↫ Lorenz (xha)
on the official Hare blog Hare is a relatively new programming language,
and originally only supported Linux and FreeBSD. This post details the
process of porting it over to OpenBSD.</p>

<p>date: 2023-12-03, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I wrote this as a
<a href="https://social.masto.land/@dave/111517322418415422">Mastodon
post</a> to a bunch of people who somehow I got cc’d to. I figured I
should share it here too.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Let’s start with feeds and build as much of a Mastodon as we can,
without inventing anything new and see what we come up with.
</li>
<li>
That way we know at every step we’re standing on a solid foundation of
interop.
</li>
<li>
At the same time invest in the feed support of every contender, no
matter what “verse” its part of.
</li>
<li>
John Spurlock has done an exemplary implementation of RSS 2.0 feeds for
Bluesky. That
<a href="https://rss.firesky.tv/?filter=from:scripting.com">format</a>
should be copied everywhere. He did it in about a week in July and it’s
great. We’re building all kinds of stuff on it. Wish it were in
Mastodon, and wish Bluesky would bake it in.
</li>
<li>
Forget about clubs, what we want is interop, maximally as widely as
possible to force the silos to get on board. They won’t unless they have
to.

<h2 id="doc-feedland-artcasting">Doc &amp; FeedLand &amp;
artcasting</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-03, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I pinged Doc the other day saying he should do an artcasting feed.
</p>
<p>
Doc is in addition to being a prodigious blogger, also is a photo taker
and story teller, so he is perfect for artcasting.
</p>
<p>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2017/07/29/doc.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I
was then going to think about what would be the easiest way to get him
going, and quickly realized the fastest way is Bluesky because
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+spurlock">John
Spurlock</a> did it right and his feeds coming out of Bluesky are
totally artcasting-compatible. Just like that. (Artcasting is one of
those cases where almost everyone was doing it the right way. Absolutely
no one invented it, it was just obvious how it should work, obvious to
enough people.)
</p>
<p>
But I wanted to talk about it with A8C people first, because it’s also
an opportunity to support it in WordPress, or to create a small app that
interfaces to WordPress, so it can lead here too. But Doc beat me to it,
he posted a
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dsearls.bsky.social/post/3kfnwb6dbf72b">beautiful
picture</a> of a building site his new hometown to Bluesky, and it
appeared in
<a href="https://rss.firesky.tv/?filter=from:dsearls.bsky.social">his
RSS 2.0 feed</a>, and of course it
<a href="https://feedland.com/?river=https%3A%2F%2Frss.firesky.tv%2F%3Ffilter%3Dfrom%3Adsearls.bsky.social">showed</a>
<a href="https://feedland.com/?item=594431">up</a>
<a href="https://feedland.com/?feedurl=https%3A%2F%2Frss.firesky.tv%2F%3Ffilter%3Dfrom%3Adsearls.bsky.social">in
FeedLand</a> when I subscribed to his feed.
</p>
<p>
So I added it to my collection of artcasting feeds, and the
<a href="https://lists.feedcorps.org/artshow.opml">new version</a> is
now
<a href="https://feedland.com/?readinglist=https%3A%2F%2Flists.feedcorps.org%2Fartshow.opml">available</a>
on <a href="https://feedland.com/?feedcorps=true">FeedCorps</a> and his
name shows up in the list in the
<a href="https://artshow2.scripting.com/">artshow app</a>.
</p>
<p>
This is how we do it, keep turning the wheel.
</p>
<p>
Interop my friends.

<h2 id="the-world-depends-on-60-year-old-code-no-one-knows-anymore">The
world depends on 60-year-old code no one knows anymore</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>The problem is that very few people are interested in learning COBOL
these days. Coding it is cumbersome, it reads like an English lesson
(too much typing), the coding format is meticulous and inflexible, and
it takes far longer to compile than its competitors. And since nobody’s
learning it anymore, programmers who can work with and maintain all that
code are a increasingly hard to find. Many of these “COBOL cowboys” are
aging out of the workforce, and replacements are in short supply. This
puts us in a tricky predicament. We need to maintain and modernize the
code that underpins so much of the business and finance worlds, but we
don’t have enough skilled workers we need to carry out those updates.
This is precisely the kind of problem that IBM thinks it can fix with
AI. ↫ JD Sartain for PCMag It seems like learning and getting good at
COBOL is a surefire way to ensure job security. I wonder if there’s a
way to make modern applications or software in COBOL? I mean, there are
COBOL compilers for modern platforms, of course, but are there any
bindings (I think that’s the correct term?) for modern GUI toolkits like
GTK, Qt, and so on? The headline’s probably a bit hyperbolic, but the
core of the issue stands.</p>

you ever wanted to know about HP’s 9000 Series 300</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>Hewlett-Packard’s 9000 Series 300 (HP300) was a range of technical
workstations based on Motorola 680×0 microprocessors. Superbly
engineered in modular form, and ahead of the curve in terms of
functionality, these workstations were used mainly as instrument
controllers and for desktop technical computing. The HP300 series
launched in 1985 with the models 310 (pictured below) and 320. It
evolved through numerous variants of increasing power, concluding with
the 38x models released in 1991. The series was officially obsolete as
of 1997. The definitive website dedicated to vintage Hewlett-Packard
computers is the wonderful HP Computer Museum, which has excellent and
wide-ranging archival resources. The present site is focused
specifically on the HP 9000 series 300 and is for anyone interested in
the history, conservation and restoration of these personal
workstations. ↫ hp-series300.net Everything you could possibly ever want
to know about the series 300, in one place. It’s incredibly detailed,
and if you have your eyes on buying one of these machines, I urge you to
keep this resource in a permanently open tab so you know what you’re
doing.</p>

<h2 id="the-unix-v6-shell-and-how-control-flow-worked-in-it">The Unix V6
shell and how control flow worked in it</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>On Unix, ‘test‘ and ‘[‘ are two names for (almost) the same program
and shell builtin. Although today people mostly use it under its ‘[‘
name, when it was introduced in V7 along side the Bourne shell, it only
was called ‘test‘; the ‘[‘ name was only nascent until years later. I
don’t know for sure why it was called ‘test‘, but there are interesting
hints about its potential genesis in the shell used in V6 Research Unix,
the predecessor to V7, and the control flow constructs that shell used.
↫ Chris Siebenmann I’m fairly sure if I read this about 12 more times,
I’ll start to maybe understand some of it.</p>
