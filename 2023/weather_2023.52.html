Mesoscale Discussion 2346
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0331 PM CST Mon Dec 25 2023

Areas affected...Portions of South-Central North Dakota...central
and eastern South Dakota...and North Central Nebraska

Concerning...Heavy snow 

Valid 252131Z - 260130Z

SUMMARY...Moderate to heavy snow possible this evening, with
blizzard conditions at times from south-central North Dakota
southward into central South Dakota and north-central Nebraska.

DISCUSSION...A deep surface low located across western Iowa has
begun to occlude this afternoon while bringing warm and moist air
across Iowa and Minnesota into the Dakotas. Aloft, a mid-level low
is stacked back to the southwest with very cold air being funneled
in by strong northwesterly flow across the High Plains into the
Central Plains. Areas of moderate to heavy snow have been ongoing
across eastern Nebraska and eastern South Dakota, with a transition
to accumulating ice/freezing rain to the northeast. 

Due to the strength of the surface low, background flow has
increased with the strong mass response with surface winds sustained
at 25-30 mph gusting as high as 40-50 mph. Blizzard conditions have
been observed across central South Dakota with visibility around 1/4
mi and sustained winds at 20-30 mph gusting up to 50 mph. As the
surface low shifts back westward through the evening, strengthening
mid-level flow around 40-50 kts will overspread portions of the
Dakotas into western Nebraska. Warm air overspreading eastern North
Dakota into northeastern South Dakota will lead to a transition from
snow to freezing rain with potential for ice accumulations. The
increased upper-level support  across the Dakotas into far northern
Nebraska will aid in formation of snow bands capable of 1"+/hr rates
along with potential for blowing snow and reduced visibility below
1/4 mi with continued strong surface winds. These conditions will
continue to spread westward as the low shifts west through the late
evening and overnight.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0300 PM CST Mon Dec 25 2023

Valid 271200Z - 021200Z

The potential for critical fire-weather conditions is low through
the extended forecast period. 

An expansive midlevel low will move gradually eastward from the
Middle MS Valley to the central/southern Appalachians from
D3/Wednesday through D5/Friday. Along the southern periphery of this
feature, strong deep-layer flow will overspread the Lower MS Valley,
Gulf Coast, and Southeast. This will promote locally breezy/gusty
offshore flow across these areas, though generally cool surface
temperatures will limit RH reductions. While ongoing
extreme/exceptional drought suggests fuels may be locally receptive
to carrying fires across the region, recent rainfall and the
marginal wind/RH combination should limit most fire-weather
concerns.

Elsewhere across the CONUS, a limited overlap of warm/dry/breezy
conditions will mitigate fire-weather potential.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0158 PM CST Mon Dec 25 2023

Valid 252000Z - 261200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected through tonight.

...20Z Update...
Thunderstorms have largely been relegated to the Dry Tortugas
vicinity this afternoon and may remain west to south of the FL Keys
into this evening. Thunder potential over most of the FL Peninsula
appears rather limited. Some uptick in weak, elevated convection
should occur farther north in the southern Appalachians to Savannah
Valley vicinity, with sporadic embedded thunderstorms possible after
dusk. Poor near-surface lapse rates in conjunction with the trailing
portion of 40+ kt 850-mb flow shifting northeast while shrinking in
areal extent, all suggest that severe potential remains negligible.

..Grams.. 12/25/2023

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1021 AM CST Mon Dec 25 2023/

A large upper low dominates the weather across the CONUS today,
while the primary weather-making shortwave rotates across the
Southeast states and Mid-Atlantic region.  Scattered thunderstorms
are possible from the central Appalachians southward into FL today,
with relatively cool/stable near-surface conditions limiting any
risk of severe weather.

...FL Keys...
The only area of some minor concern is over the middle and lower FL
Keys.  Radar/satellite imagery show a cluster of strong
thunderstorms about 120nm west of Key West.  This activity is moving
slowly eastward, and will likely affect the Keys late this afternoon
and early evening.  However, low-level winds are weakening with
time, and CAPE values are strong over the open waters compared to
farther east near the Keys.  Therefore, the risk of severe storms
moving inland appears low.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1118 AM CST Sun Dec 24 2023

Valid 251200Z - 261200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected on Monday.

...Southeast...
While no severe area is currently highlighted, conditional brief
tornado/localized damaging wind potential may become apparent from
the FL Panhandle/southeast AL to the GA/SC border area on Monday.

A gradually weakening shortwave impulse will move northeast from the
Lower MS Valley to the OH Valley, pivoting around a deepening
mid/upper low over the central Great Plains. Primary surface cyclone
will occlude across parts of the Lower to Mid-MO Valley via a
northwest arc through IA. A minor, southern-stream surface wave near
the AL/FL Panhandle coast at 12Z Monday should decay with
convergence along the cold front waning through the day. The
trailing portion of an initially strong low-level jet within the
warm conveyor will likewise pivot northeast from AL/western GA/FL
Panhandle across the TN Valley and southern Appalachians. 

Potential for surface-based destabilization within the warm conveyor
should be quite limited inland of the Gulf Coast, with widespread
cloudiness and ongoing showers/thunderstorms amid initially poor low
to mid-level lapse rates. Meager destabilization should occur during
the day between the weakening cold front and the pivoting warm
conveyor as the mid-level dry slot overspreads in the wake of the
departing shortwave impulse, but this will be accompanied by
substantial diminishing of low-level shear. While the most likely
scenario is for a nil severe threat, favorable low-level hodographs
within the warm conveyor suggests that potential may not be
negligible if this can overlap adequate surface-based instability.

..Weinman.. 12/24/2023

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0139 AM CST Sun Dec 24 2023/

...Synopsis...
On Tuesday, a surface low will occlude in the central/northern
Plains and shift into the Upper Midwest. This will bring some breezy
conditions from the Great Lakes to the Midwest and northern Plains.
However, much of this area will either be moist with recent wetting
rainfall or too cold to support significant fire spread. Elsewhere,
fire-weather concerns will also remain minimal with a strong Arctic
high in the Intermountain West and mostly wet fuels across the
CONUS.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0137 AM CST Sun Dec 24 2023/

...Synopsis...
A upper-level trough will amplify today and eventually develop into
a closed low across the central Plains by Monday morning. During
this period, a surface low will slowly strengthen as it shifts east
along a front in the central/southern Plains. A strengthening
pressure gradient will result in breezy conditions across much of
the central CONUS. However, wetting rain has occurred or will occur
during the day today across most of the region where the strongest
winds are expected. Therefore, fire-weather concerns will be
minimal.

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not forecast through tonight across the
contiguous United States.

...East TX/LA...
A negatively tilted upper trough is moving across the Southern
Plains into the Gulf Coast region during this forecast period. 
Scattered showers and thunderstorms will occur ahead of the trough,
from TX into AL and the FL panhandle.  Surface trajectories will
limit the influx of Gulf moisture northward/inland today, making
surface-based thunderstorm development unlikely.

A strong storm or two might occur from the upper TX gulf coast to
coastal LA this afternoon, but any severe activity is expected to
remain offshore.
