**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-01-03, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

On Friday I asked ChatGPT for <a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/5bb3c392-c9bc-40eb-81c1-e3520ebffe3d">1000 words on RSS</a>. The bot sorted through all the nonsense, got the story, where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">Wikipedia</a> got <a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/be930ca9-f345-4aee-9305-b7dfc79dda10">mired</a>.  They left out almost all of the interesting stuff relating to the way it was adopted by the publishing and blogging worlds. The format isn't all that important, see the <a href="https://this.how/standards/">rules for standards-makers</a>, what matters is the interop it delivers. The RSS 0.91 to 2.0 thread was what the market built around, because it was promoted to the market and held steady for it. The other thread got bogged down in an academic theory of how the web should evolve. Content syndication was a real application. That's the story, imho. There was no mention of the NYT in the piece, or Salon, Red Herring, Wired and Motley Fool. Or NPR in re podcasting.

## Is your Instagram feed “news”? Depends on how you feel.

date: 2024-01-03, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

We’ve become quite used to the notion that social media platforms’ endless stream of flattened, homogenized “content” has blurred the line between news and other forms of media and information (though, of course, that line was never perfectly clear to begin with). That blurring has allowed new and innovative voices into the news ecosystem, but it has also made news...

## Conservatives’ “anti-woke” alternative to Disney has arrived

As fanfare blares, female sprinters at the starting line suspiciously eye a man in a wig. A hulking, goateed wrestler slams a woman half his size to the mat. An ominous voiceover intones that women’s sports are being “trans-formed.” No, this isn’t the beginning of a classic cross-dressing comedy. It’s the trailer for “Lady Ballers,” a...

## Answers to my analytics inquiry

date: 2024-01-03, from: Manu - I write blog

<p>I’m aware it’s not Saturday but I realised I didn’t need to collect a full week worth of data to get <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/analytics-inquiry">an answer to my question</a> and so I decided that three full days were enough. I have data for December 30th and 31st and January 1st. That’s more that enough. So let’s do some digging shall we.</p>
<h2>A quick acknowledgement</h2>
<p>Before I cruch the numbers I want to highlight two people who got in touch mentioning their similar experiments: <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2020/google-vs-netlify-analytics/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Jim Nielsen</a>—who's also a <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/pb-jim-nielsen">P&amp;B guest</a>—and <a href="https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/analytics-for-sites-with-tech-savvy-audiences/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Chris Krycho</a>.</p>
<h2>The metrics</h2>
<p>I think it’s important to first establish what these tools are measuring. I’m interested in one single data point: how many people have accessed my content. Should be simple enough in theory. That information is often referred to as Unique user or Unique visitor. But how are these tools determining what counts as unique?</p>
<p>Plausible doesn’t use cookies and to track unique visitors they do the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every single HTTP request sends the IP address and the User-Agent to the server so that’s what we use. We generate a daily changing identifier using the visitor’s IP address and User-Agent. To anonymize these datapoints and make them impossible to relate back to the user, we run them through a hash function with a rotating salt.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So a combination of IP and User Agent. So if someone if browsing from different devices they’d probably be counted multiple times. <a href="https://plausible.io/data-policy">More info are available on the Plausible website</a>.</p>
<p>Simple Analytics tracks a slightly different metric called “unique visits” which is based, according to their docs, on the referrer. <a href="https://docs.simpleanalytics.com/explained/unique-visits">More info at this page</a>.</p>
<p>Fathom tracks “Visitors” defined as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A visitor is a unique person who's visited your site.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not very helpful. I tried to poke around the docs but I couldn’t find how they track it so I’ll move on to the final platform, Pirsch. They do something similar to what Plausible is doing</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pirsch generates a unique number for each visitor calculated from the visitor's IP address, the User-Agent, and a random string that is set for each website. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, we have Goaccess, the tool I’m going to use to analyse my server logs. Goaccess defines a Unique Visitor as </p>
<blockquote>
<p>HTTP requests containing the same IP, the same date, and the same user agent are considered a unique visitor. By default, it includes web crawlers/spiders.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have our definitions, it’s time to get to some numbers.</p>
<h2>The numbers</h2>
<p>These are the (Unique) Visitors reported by the four online services and my server logs</p>
<ul>
<li>Plausible <code>358</code></li>
<li>Fathom <code>403</code></li>
<li>Pirsch <code>273</code></li>
<li>Simple Analytics <code>728</code></li>
<li>Server Logs <code>3894</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Already, the difference between logs and client analytics is HUGE. But we need to dig a bit deeper into the logs because the situation there is messy. To start, there’s the issue of bots, spiders and crawlers. Goaccess has an optional flag I turned on to ignore a huge number of those. That <code>3894</code> is already ignoring a good % of non-human traffic. But I am sure something is still slipping through. Another thing that is present in my server logs that is obviously not present in the other four tools is RSS traffic because the JS necessary to keep track of the traffic is not included in the RSS feed. If I remove all the entries in my logs mentioning either <code>rss</code> or <code>feed</code> the Unique Visitors go from <code>3894</code> to <code>2111</code>. Lower but still way higher than the client side data that was averaging around <code>440</code>.</p>
<p>Clearly more work is needed on these logs because they’re incredibly noisy. I removed all 404s, manually removed all the entries mentioning any type of bot, I also grabbed only entries matching this regex <code>(Gecko|Chrome|Firefox|AppleWebKit|Mac OS|Windows NT|Android)</code>. And that leaves us with <code>1821</code> unique visitors, according to my logs.</p>
<p>That number is still a lot higher than what I’m seeing in the online dashboard so what gives? Well, I think something obvious is happening here. I am a web developer with an indie blog that is followed by a lot of people who are also passionate about the web and are tech savvy. So I’d bet the % of people running one or multiple ad blockers between my readers is quite high. An article from the <a href="https://plausible.io/blog/google-analytics-adblockers-missing-data">Plausible blog</a> reports that a huge % of people is blocking google analytics for example but I’m sure modern ad blockers are also preventing these tools to work properly. Hell I had to disable mine just to access those dashboards. My visits to my site were not counted. Estimating the number of people running ad blockers is impossible and a quick online search tells me the numbers are anything between 30% to 65%.</p>
<p>If I were to adjust the numbers coming out of the four tools I used based on the 65% which is probably reasonable considering my type of audience we’d get</p>
<ul>
<li>Plausible <code>967</code></li>
<li>Fathom <code>1089</code></li>
<li>Pirsch <code>737</code></li>
<li>Simple Analytics <code>1967</code></li>
</ul>
<p>A lot closer to the <code>1821</code> coming out of my server logs. We can probably safely assume that some of those <code>1821</code> are bots cleverly disguised as genuine traffic and the true number has to be somewhere in the <code>~1200</code> range.</p>
<p>So, do I finally have an answer? Is <code>~1200</code> the answer I was looking for? Well, not quite. We excluded RSS earlier because it was not part of the data gathered by the four client side tools but RSS traffic is still traffic worth counting. Especially in 2024! Figuring out actual RSS traffic is close to impossible. Goaccess tells me there were <code>1973</code> unique IPs pinging the various feeds on my site. I’m going to follow <a href="https://darekkay.com/blog/rss-subscriber-count/">Darek</a> lead here and simply count exposed subscribers. According to my logs  we have:</p>
<ul>
<li>12 different Feedbin feeds with unique <code>feed-id</code> for a total of <code>439</code> subscribers;</li>
<li>3 instances of Inoreader with very distinct subscribers number for a total of <code>126</code></li>
<li>4 Feedly instances with very distinct subscribers number for a total of <code>391</code></li>
<li>NewsBlur, BazQux Reader, and The Old Reader are the other services exposing subscribers number and combined are other <code>70</code></li>
</ul>
<p>So the total, according to these services is <code>1026</code> subscribers, if my math is correct. Only thing missing to this weird roundup is the <code>110</code> people who are getting my posts directly in their inbox.</p>
<h2>The conclusion</h2>
<p>Is there even a lesson to be learn here? Don’t trust numbers blindly perhaps? Server logs are messy and can be over inflated while client based analytics can greatly under report your numbers if you have a very tech savvy audience. Also RSS is still doing fine and you should definitely have an RSS feed if you have a personal blog. And if you don’t have a personal blog I don’t know what you’re waiting for. Ditch social media and start blogging. You can thank me later. And if you don’t know where to start hit me up and I’ll be happy to help.</p>

## How I forked SteamOS for my living room PC

date: 2024-01-02, from: OS News

SteamOS 3 (“Holo”) is the Arch-based Linux distribution built for the Steam Deck, Valve Software’s portable PC gaming device. It’s a very interesting Linux distribution even when you only focus on how it updates itself: updates are performed atomically by downloading a new read-only root filesystem to an inactive partition, then rebooting into that partition. But consumers can also run steamos-devmode to unlock the root filesystem, put the pacman database in working order, and give them a working Linux distro with a normal package manager. This A/B atomic updates system is pretty standard for OSes these days, but there’s a lot going on in SteamOS that makes them work even with heavy customization by the end-user. I wanted to explore that while still being able to make changes to the root filesystem images. steamos-devmode is the easy way out; I wanted to make a proper fork. Here’s how I did it. ↫ iliana etaoin This article has sparked my interest to build a living room PC for Steam gaming for my wife and I, so we can play couch coop Steam games on an actual couch instead of behind our PC desk. Very detailed and in-depth, this article also teaches a lot about how SteamOS works under the hood.

## Oldest known version of DOS archived

## Steamboat Willie and ChatGPT

<p>I got this idea from <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mmasnick.bsky.social/post/3khzcijt7yp2b">Mike Masnick</a> on Bluesky. </p>
<p>I asked ChatGPT if Steamboat Willie is now public domain. It said yes.</p>
<p>I asked if it could draw me a picture of SW saying he's now public domain.</p>
<p><div class="divInlineImage"><center><img class="imgInline" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/01/02/publicDombat.png"></center>Not quite. Public dombat.</div></p>
<p>Was that intentional, I asked?</p>
<p>No. Apology. Let's try again.</p>
<p><div class="divInlineImage"><center><img class="imgInline" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/01/02/publicDomant.png"></center>Now he's public domant.</div></p>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-01-02, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2022/05/30/quickley.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Basketball is the best game to watch because you get to know the players. Only five players on the court at once, they play both offense and defense, and they aren't wearing armor like football players, you see their faces, whether they're cool or hot, emotional or stoic, up or down. So when your team trades two of its best-known players for three players you've never heard of, to a team that's rebuilding, first you feel sad, and then you wonder what the new teams will be like. One of the traded players, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Quickley">Immanuel Quickley</a>, is a young, happy warrior with a deadly offense, but he was a Knicks bench player because they already had an All-Star quality player at his position, point guard, the quarterback of a basketball team. He led the second unit, and probably had a lot to do with the Knicks' success last year. I watched the Raptors game last night, and while the joy seemed to be gone from his demeanor, he was their starting point guard, and now he gets a chance to prove himself. The Knicks got something they needed, desperately, now that their defensive leader, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Robinson">Mitchell Robinson</a>, is injured and out for the season -- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O.G._Anunoby">OG Anunoby</a> -- who fit in so well into the starting lineup, in place of the other player the Knicks traded, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RJ_Barrett">RJ Barrett</a>, who never became the producer we hoped he would. The new Knicks starting five are a much better team than they were before the trade, or so it seems after one game. I admit, I had gotten bored with Knicks this season, but yesterday's game was interesting and exciting, and even better <a href="https://www.si.com/nba/knicks/news/new-york-knicks-2024-game-recap-minnesota-timerwolves-julius-randle-og-anunoby">the Knicks won</a>, against one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves">best teams</a> in the NBA. Yet we will miss <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Quickley">IQ</a> in New York, and hope for him to have a great career in Toronto and beyond.

## Create more. Consume less.

date: 2024-01-02, from: Manu - I write blog

<p>I spend a lot of time online. One could argue it’s too much time. And in that time, I consume content. Mountains of content. Huge mountains of content. Maybe insurmountable mountains of content. No matter how much I try, there will always be another interesting blog post, YouTube video, or podcast episode. I consume a lot more than I create. I suspect I’m not alone in this. And I think there’s a good balance to be found here. Right now I feel the pendulum has swung too far in the direction of the consumption and I have to bring it back towards the middle.</p>
<p>I feel that is something I need to do for myself, for the sake of my mental sanity but I also think that’s something the internet as a whole would benefit from. Consuming content online is, for the most part, a mindless act. But creating content forces you to reflect, to introspect, to look at yourself and the world around you in different ways.</p>
<p>More people <a href="https://ma.tt/2024/01/birthday-gift">should follow Matt’s advice</a>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Publish a post. About anything! It can be long or short, a photo or a video, maybe a quote or a link to something you found interesting. Don’t sweat it. Just blog. Share something you created, or amplify something you enjoyed. It doesn’t take much. The act of publishing will be a gift for you and me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this is going to be my 2024 mantra: <em>Create more. Consume less.</em></p>

## Twenty Twenty-Three

date: 2024-01-02, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>2023 has been a memorable year and –at times– downright existential. Looking at the scorecard, it’s pretty clear there’s been more downs than ups. Despite everything, I maintain a positive outlook and am forward-looking.</p>
<p>I’m happy to report that I failed at all <a href="https://daverupert.com/2022/12/twenty-twenty-two/">my SMART goals from 2022</a>. Every. Single. One. Zero KPIs were harmed during the course of the last year. Running a quick postmortem, I think setting goals like this is stupid now. That said, I love data. So as I wrap up this year, I’ll start with the quantifiable outcomes and move into the less quantifiable aspects of 2023…</p>
<h2>Fell short in the books department</h2>
<p>I read or listened to 39 books this year which means I officially fell out of the “Book-A-Week” club and I’m glad about that outcome. Rather than powering through an endless backlog, I took a more one-in/one-out approach with the library. I feel like I got more enjoyment out of the books I picked up this year by taking it slower.</p>
<p>I had a goal of reading four Japanese language manga but failed at that. I started two (<em>Delicious in Dungeon</em> and <em>Mobile Suit Gundam: Cucuruz Doan’s Island</em>) but got hung up on cooking and military vocabulary. Japanese has always been like that for me, it takes a lot to load the “domain” into my Brain RAM. With some effort this may be something I can re-pick up in 2024.</p>
<p>I planned to read less in 2023, so I guess I succeeded there. I had another goal of watching more TV, but that didn’t happen. I watched some anime (Gundam) so perhaps I qualified but I didn’t keep track. I also switched from audiobooks to catching up on podcasts. No regrets.</p>
<h2>The year of the personal website</h2>
<p>I wrote ~70 blog posts this year between my blog and the Luro blog. That’s not a good year… that’s my best year yet! And I have 39 drafts in the hopper. My short term goal is to push publish on half of them. But let’s look back at some of the greatest hits from this year.</p>

</ul>
<p>And it’s not just a good year of blogging for me, I can feel the resurgence of blogging in my bones. <a href="https://daverupert.com/2023/07/one-friend-a-day/">I cleared out over 2000 items in my RSS queue</a> and there’s 500 more unreads in there again. If I were running a clandestine XML-based social network, then I bet the number of people in that club would have tripled this year. More people blogging on their personal sites makes the web feel small and <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-commentary/internet-future-about-to-get-weird-1234938403/">weird again</a>, like walking through a friendly neighborhood as opposed to being under the florescent lights of a giant shopping mall.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see what happens with websites in 2024 and beyond. We’re at a weird tipping point for the web where ChatGPT makes it trivial to flood the internet with disingenuous, cheaply generated content spam. What’s the point of writing if a machine can bullshit faster than I can? Why would I put effort into reading that which you didn’t put effort into writing? Did you hear that story about the male conference organizer who was also a fake dev influencer e-girl? Big yikes.</p>
<p>I wonder if the “personal” part of personal websites is the difference maker going forward. I’m more apt to share something written by someone I know than some AI content farm.</p>
<h2>A year of emergencies, loss, maladies, and stress</h2>
<p>We hit the deductible on our health insurance this year and I think that’s a perfect metaphor for 2023. A brief chronological recounting of this year’s trauma…</p>
<ul>
<li>(Feb) <a href="https://daverupert.com/2023/02/vibe-check-25/">Austin froze again</a> - 125 hours without power. Thankful for friends who housed us and helped us chainsaw branches.</li>
<li>(Apr) <a href="https://daverupert.com/2023/04/goodbye-rudy/">Goodbye, Rudy</a> - Our sweet dog crossed the rainbow bridge.</li>
<li>(Apr) An emergency appendectomy - As family boarded a plane to visit us, an appendix decided to leave town. Thanks to Mark, our friend, who performed the surgery.</li>
<li>(May) Back-to-back-to-back-to-back cases of strep - Thank you, public school system.</li>
<li>(May) Stress attack - Ack! Began <a href="https://daverupert.com/2023/10/the-plan-and-the-plateau/">dieting</a> and trying to relax.</li>
<li>(Sept) Root canal to kill a jaw-eating bacteria in tooth - No more purple tooth!</li>
<li>(Sept) Diagnosing a mysterious foot fungus - Not fungus, Disney rash.</li>
<li>(Oct) Physical therapy and an MRI for a herniated L4 - Back pain is the dumbest pain</li>
</ul>
<p>Managing stress and losing weight was my big personal focus this year. It feels good to lose 30 pounds, but it feels even better to lower my resting heart rate 10+ BPM. Being on a “no fun” diet for 7+ months is good for me but contributes to a feeling of a boring year. I’ll take that trade I guess or sell a kidney so I can afford Ozempic.</p>
<h2>The Good Parts</h2>
<p>2023 wasn’t all bad vibes! Some notable and good events happened this year…</p>
<ul>
<li>My wife and I celebrated 15 years of marriage.</li>
<li><a href="https://daverupert.com/2023/08/vibe-check-28/">Vacationed in San Diego</a> with friends and family.</li>
<li><a href="https://daverupert.com/2023/07/my-dad-recliner/">I got a recliner</a> that I use often, like a true dad.</li>
<li>Went to Figma’s Config as an “influencer”
<ul>
<li>Played dice for drinks in a bar in Chinatown, will never forget this night</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://daverupert.com/2023/09/luro-is-out-of-beta/">Got Luro out of Beta</a> ❤️ <a href="https://daverupert.com/2023/09/feedback-small-teams/">Thanks to everyone who has given feedback</a>.</li>
<li>Web components are having a moment and I like web components.</li>
<li><a href="https://shoptalkshow.com/596/">ShopTalk wrapped our 12th year</a> and we’ll hit Episode 600 in a few weeks.</li>
</ul>
<p>What made this year were the small moments that don’t make the “Year in Review” lists. Like watching my son play baseball, or my daughter master new cheer skills, the jokes and tickles, playing Christmas songs on the piano, building the occasional plastic model, or playing games with the family. Those are the moments that make up the majority of my days.</p>
<h2>🔮 What’s in store for 2024…</h2>
<p>2024 is gearing up to be a year of big changes, hopefully with less medical surprises… but it’s New Year’s Day and I already know that’s not the case. Ughck. Nevertheless, we persist. For me it’s a season of reassessing, reprioritizing, and rethinking my personal goals. What do I want for ol’ Dave Rupert and how do I get there? Not an easy question to ask myself, but worthwhile.</p>
<p>Since I failed at quantifiable goals, I’m not doing those again. Here’s what I have on my brain that would make for a successful 2024.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Activate an active lifestyle</strong> - I addressed a lot of stress and weight loss this past year, I’d like to layer in sustainable activity as well.</li>
<li><strong>Write more shitty sci-fi</strong> - I have about six stories on deck and I’d love to complete them.</li>
<li><strong>Draw more</strong> - I’d love to be someone who doodles all the time. I could be that guy.</li>
<li><strong>Write for other publications</strong> - I’m comfortable with self-publishing on my blog and I’d like to up the editorial challenge this year by writing for other sites or zines.</li>
<li><strong>Survive the 2024 US Election</strong> - This will occupy enough mental bandwidth that I am reserving space for it.</li>
<li><strong>Make a video game?</strong> - Always chasing this dream.</li>
</ul>
<p>That seems like a year’s worth of ambition right there and a good place to end this retrospective. Tired, weak, and worn; I hope this year is better for you than the last and that those around you are happy and healthy.</p>

## NetSurf 3.11 released

date: 2024-01-01, from: OS News

NetSurf, the small and efficient browser for RISC OS, Haiku, AmigaOS 4, and obscure platforms you&#8217;ve probably never heard of like &#8220;Linux&#8221; and &#8220;macOS&#8221; has seen a new release &#8211; version 3.11. NetSurf is written in C and has its own browser engine &#8211; it&#8217;s not based on Google&#8217;s browser engines, Chromium and Firefox&#8217; Gecko/Quantum. NetSurf 3.11 features improved page layout with CSS flex support. It also features many other optimisations and enhancements. ↫ NetSurf&#8217;s official website It&#8217;s an obvious upgrade for everyone who uses NetSurf, since if you&#8217;re using NetSurf, odds are the platform you&#8217;re using it on doesn&#8217;t really offer many alternatives.

## Looking back at 2023

<h1>Looking back at 2023</h1>

<p>We played at least 65 games <a href="https://campaignwiki.org/wiki/MontagInZ%c3%bcrich/2023">in 2023</a> on the <a href="https://campaignwiki.org/wiki/MontagInZ%c3%bcrich/Discord_Server">Grenzland Discord</a> server!

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-01-01, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

BTW, I wrote a wizzy writing tool for WordPress. Here's a <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/01/01/blogbrowserscreenshot.png">screen shot</a>. I wanted something simpler for posting to feedland.blog. I think it could work even more smoothly, it was a first effort. One thing I don't understand is why aren't there a dozen such writing tools for WordPress. It has a great API, really easy to work with. It's a very versatile product, yet people seem to stick with the built-in writing interface. Curious.

There's no reason an independent developer such as myself should have to implement an identity system, and no reason a user should want me to. Yet there is no service that provides storage for users that is accessible to apps that the user chooses. There are a bunch of companies that have all the pieces. There would be so many benefits of this, it would help drive open standards, and make it possible for multiple apps to work on the same data. I don't know why this product doesn't exist. It should.

## Yet another year of living without

date: 2024-01-01, from: Manu - I write blog

<p>Years ago, inspired by Leo Babauta, I did a <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/without">year of living without</a>. Each month I tried to live without something to see if it was actually something I needed in my life. It’s a fun experiment, one I personally recommend to anyone.</p>
<p>This year, I’m gonna do it again but with the same twist I tried—very unsucessfully—last year. Instead of doing twelve one-month long experiments, I’m just going to do two but for the entire year. The two things I’m going to live without are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coffee</li>
<li>YouTube</li>
</ul>
<p>Coffee is something I don’t think I need in my life and I can replace it with tea or with something else. I went months here and there without coffee but never an entire year so it’s going to be interesting to see if that has any effect on my body.</p>
<p>YouTube, I just think it does more harm than good to my mind and so I’m gonna try to the entire year without consuming content on the platform. Two exceptions:</p>
<ol>
<li>If someone is showing me a video on their device I’m going to watch it</li>
<li>If it’s a video embedded somewhere related to some actually important news that are relevant to me.</li>
</ol>
<p>Those are the two exceptions, everything else is banned in 2024. I’ll replace YouTube with more books and podcasts. And speaking of books...</p>
<h2>Resolutions</h2>
<p>Read more books is one of my new year resolutions. I might write about what I’m reading during the year. Will also try to keep my <a href="https://literal.club/manuelmoreale" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Literal</a> profile up to date. The other resolutions are to drink more water, no screens in the bedroom, and take more care of my body. I have plans for how to tackle all those items and I’ll blog about in the upcoming weeks.</p>
<p>Have a great new year everyone!</p>

## Who’s Counting?

date: 2024-01-01, from: Ayjay blog

I’m not doing an end-of-year roundup of what I’ve written this year, or what I’ve read, or what I’ve watched, or what I’ve listened to, or where I’ve traveled, or the museums I’ve visited, or the concerts I’ve attended – that last one because I didn’t attend any concerts in 2023, not even Taylor Swift’s [&#8230;]

## The IDEs we had 30 years ago… And we lost

date: 2023-12-31, from: OS News

I grew up learning to program in the late 1980s / early 1990s. Back then, I did not fully comprehend what I was doing and why the tools I used were impressive given the constraints of the hardware we had. Having gained more knowledge throughout the years, it is now really fun to pick up DOSBox to re-experience those programs and compare them with our current state of affairs. This time around, I want to look at the pure text-based IDEs that we had in that era before Windows eclipsed the PC industry. I want to do this because those IDEs had little to envy from the IDEs of today—yet it feels as if we went through a dark era where we lost most of those features for years and they are only resurfacing now. If anything, stay for a nostalgic ride back in time and a little rant on “bloat”. But, more importantly, read on to gain perspective on what existed before so that you can evaluate future feature launches more critically. ↫ Julio Merino Fast forward to today, and the most popular text editor among programmers is a website running in Chrome in a window. No wonder most popular applications are Electron trashfires now. Times sure have changed.

## Why are Apple silicon VMs so different?

date: 2023-12-31, from: OS News

Running macOS virtual machines (VMs) on Apple silicon Macs may not seem popular, but it has long been one of Apple’s important goals. Yet, if you do use a virtualiser on an M-series Mac, you’ll know how different it is from those that virtualise macOS and other operating systems on Intel Macs. This article explains why virtualisation is so important, and how it has become so different. ↫ Howard Oakley Excellent read, as always from Howard Oakley.

## Rust9x update: Rust 1.76.0-beta

date: 2023-12-31, from: OS News

20 months since the initial release, Rust9x is back, whether you like it or not! I&#8217;ve spent the last couple of days migrating the changes from Rust 1.61-beta to Rust 1.76-beta, and filling some of the holes in API support on the way. ↫ Dennis Duda Yes, this is Rust ported to Windows 9x, and this new releases comes with a lot of the benefits in 1.76, but also adds backtrace support, thread parking support, and initial work on adding 64bit support for 64bit Windows XP and newer.

## A Supply Problem

date: 2023-12-31, from: Doc Searls (at Harvard), New Old Blog

A while back, my gastroenterologist insisted that I get accustomed to eating high-fiber cereal in the morning. And so I have. It does work. He recommended Fiber One. I didn&#8217;t like it, but I put up with it until I found Trader Joe&#8217;s version, which tasted much better. Since Bloomington is more than an hour [&#8230;]

## Podcasts I still listen to

date: 2023-12-31, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1>Podcasts I still listen to</h1>

<p>It&rsquo;s been <a href="2021-07-27_Podcasts_I_listen_to">a while</a>. Time for an update!</p>

<ul>
<li>3d6 Down The Line, with Jon and friends.
There&rsquo;s an RPG podcast back in the list!
Mostly because they play in Arden Vul and I am running the same megadungeon.
I claim that listening to the podcast counts as prep! 😁</li>
<li>Into the Megadungeon, with Benjamin Laurence. Another RPG podcast.
What is happening‽</li>
<li>Daydreaming about Dragons, by Judd Karlmann.
I guess I do listen to RPG podcasts after all.</li>
<li>Zock Bock Radio, by <a class="account" href="https://rollenspiel.social/@settembrini" title="@settembrini@rollenspiel.social">@settembrini</a>. <a class="account" href="https://rollenspiel.social/@hasran" title="@hasran@rollenspiel.social">@hasran</a>, and others, mostly German, some English interviews.</li>
<li>99% Invisible, with Roman Mars.
I still love it. Design, architecture, urban planning…</li>
<li>What Roman Mars Can Learn About Con Law, with Professor Elizabeth Joh.
Still the only way I can bear hearing about Trump.</li>
<li>Articles of Interest, by Avery Trufelman.
Love hearing about fashion and history.</li>
<li>In Our Time. History, Science, Philosophy, with Melvin Bragg.
The best topics, clearly.</li>
<li>Thinking Allowed, with Laurie Taylor. Social science, an old classic.</li>
<li>Dan Carlin&rsquo;s Hardcore History. These episodes are long. But they&rsquo;re good.</li>
<li>Am Wegrand. A botanist explaining flowers to a journalist. In Swiss German.</li>
<li>Farm to Taber, with Sarah Taber. Agriculture!
I didn&rsquo;t even know that I cared, but I guess I do.</li>
</ul>

<p>Podcasts still in the list but it&rsquo;s been a while:</p>

<ul>
<li>Zoo Zürich Backstage. Still some episodes left unplayed.</li>
<li>Denkangebot Podcast. Political stuff, in German, by Katharina Nocun.</li>
<li>Hörkombinat: Politik, in German, by Elvira Isenring and Dominik Dusek.</li>
<li>Historisch. Schweizer Geschichte, in German, by Dr. Nicole Billeter.</li>
<li>History of Philosophy Without Any Gaps, by Peter Adamson.</li>
<li>History of Indian Philosophy, by Jonardon Ganeri and Peter Adamson.</li>
<li>History of Africana Philosophy, by Chike Jeffers and Peter Adamson.</li>
<li>History of Byzantium, by Robin Pierson.</li>
<li>History of the Crusades, by Sharyn Eastaugh.</li>
<li>The British History Podcast, by Jamie Jeffers.</li>
<li>Ten Very Big Books. I was reading through the Malazan Books of the Fallen again, and that podcast seemed perfect for the occasional summary.
But the book has been lying on the coffee table for a while, now…</li>
</ul>

<p>Done, but great:</p>

<ul>
<li>History of Rome, by Mike Duncan.</li>
<li>Revolutions, by Mike Duncan.</li>
<li>The Anthropocene Reviewed, by John Green.</li>
</ul>

<p>Heard about but not added:</p>

<ul>
<li>The German History Podcast.</li>
</ul>

<p>And there are a gazillion of podcasts in unsubscribed state, or in subscribed-but-no-downloads state. Yikes.</p>

<p>I guess I don&rsquo;t have to buy audiobooks.</p>

<p>Sadly, I listen to far less podcasts now that I work from home instead of walking to the office and back every day.</p>

## Good old SUSE: KDE3 on today’s openSUSE

date: 2023-12-31, from: OS News

Until some time, SUSE shipped with a default desktop environment called&#160;KDE3, and even today, openSUSE is the only distribution, for which&#160;KDE3&#160;packages are still available. In contrast to the fork&#160;TDE&#160;(Trinity Desktop Environment), these are the original KDE3 packages, which have also been used in earlier versions of SUSE Linux, and they were merely adapted to run under modern Linux systems. In the following tutorial, you are going to learn how to set up a current openSUSE system, with the look and feel of the original SUSE versions. ↫ Lioh Möller at SpaceFun An absolutely great idea, as it makes it much easier to see what the main desktop environments were like many moons ago. I hope similar tutorials spring up for GNOME and other desktop environments.

<h3>News</h3>

<p>Wiktopher was released on paperback! Our small collection of <a href="https://100r.co/media/content/inventory/wik_bdn.jpg" target="_blank">self-published books</a> is growing.</p>

<p>We finished the upholstery in the saloon, Pino feels like a new boat. We also published an article on this past summer's <a href="https://100r.co/site/solar_cooking_experiment.html" target="_blank">Solar Cooking Experiment</a>.</p>

We will now be using Sourcehut to send our monthly updates. With this new system our emails will be leaner than ever, using plain text(no html). We cannot transfer accounts to this new list ourselves, so <b>if you want to keep receiving updates by email please <a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~rabbits/newsletter" target="_blank">sign up again here</a></b>. Clicking on the subscribe button will open your email client, you can leave the body and subject of the email blank. We will keep sending newsletters with TinyLetter until the end of January 2024, so as to give people time to make the switch. If you sign up to this new list, unsuscribe from the old newsletter to avoid getting two emails with the same content for December and January. We hope you continue to follow our updates.</p>

<p>Note that since it's our first time sending updates with the new newsletter format, it may look a little wonky. We'll improve on it next month.</p>

<p>2023 was kind to us, we look forward to seeing what 2024 brings! We hope the coming year treats you all well.</p>

<h3>Pino book & movie club</h3>

<p>This month we are reading <b>The Tartar Steppe</b> by Dino Buzzati, and we went to see <b>君たちはどう生きるか(The Boy and the Heron)</b>.</p>
