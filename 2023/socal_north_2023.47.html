<p>A fun fact about me is that I cook everything I eat!  Due to allergy

own food.</p>

triumphs over USC in rivalry game, returning Victory Bell to
Westwood</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-19, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)</p>
<p><em>This post was updated on Nov. 19 at 9:35 p.m.</em> Ninety-three
yards of turf stood between the Trojans and the Bruins’ end zone. 
Buried deep in his own territory, coach Lincoln Riley called for a
MarShawn Lloyd rush on USC’s first offensive play of the third quarter. 
But instead of a four-yard run to set up second-and-6, the ball popped
out of Lloyd’s hands, landing right in front of defensive back Alex
Johnson.  Eleven yards of turf stood between the redshirt senior and the
Trojans’ end zone.  Johnson collected the ball and waltzed past the goal
line untouched, extending UCLA football’s (7-4, 4-4 Pac-12) lead over
USC (7-5, 5-4) to 18 after the Trojans’ third turnover of the day.</p>

review: Opulent aesthetics can’t save ‘Saltburn’ from narrative
vacuity</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-19, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)</p>
<p><em>This post was updated Nov. 19 at 7:12 p.m.</em> Warning: spoilers
ahead. Despite ceaseless stylistic brilliance, “Saltburn” is more fizzle
than flame. The sordid thriller ignited in theaters Friday, spotlighting
the tale of an outsider at Oxford University thrust into the staggering
aristocratic estate Saltburn for a summer with his magnetic
classmate.</p>
