<p>Anna Dodson’s performance on the court holds an emotional
undercurrent. “Anna has tremendous heart,” said coach Alfee Reft. “And
she’s OK wearing that heart on her sleeve.” Since the redshirt senior
middle blocker landed in Westwood in 2019, she has picked up two
All-Pac-12 honors and an AVCA Pacific South All-Region mention and was
named to the 2023 U.S.</p>

<p>The Bruins had the chance to relight the spark of their undefeated

Pauley Pavilion from what could be their last time playing at home in
2023.</p>

<p><em>This post was updated on Nov. 19 at 9:35 p.m.</em> Ninety-three
yards of turf stood between the Trojans and the Bruins’ end zone. 
Buried deep in his own territory, coach Lincoln Riley called for a
MarShawn Lloyd rush on USC’s first offensive play of the third quarter. 
But instead of a four-yard run to set up second-and-6, the ball popped
out of Lloyd’s hands, landing right in front of defensive back Alex
Johnson.  Eleven yards of turf stood between the redshirt senior and the
Trojans’ end zone.  Johnson collected the ball and waltzed past the goal
line untouched, extending UCLA football’s (7-4, 4-4 Pac-12) lead over
USC (7-5, 5-4) to 18 after the Trojans’ third turnover of the day.</p>
