<p>
This is an <em>introductory </em>workshop on using QGIS, an open-source
geographic information system (GIS) software program. In this basic
introduction, you’ll get an overview of QGIS’s interface, see where to
download spatial data, along with three examples of what you can do with
QGIS. This class is for beginners wishing to learn a GIS system, as no
previous knowledge of a GIS system is required. Highly recommended for
first-year geology students, but all are welcome. 
</p>
<p>
As part of <a href="https://www.gisday.com/" target="_blank">GIS
Day</a>, this class is being offered as a special in-person session in
the Geology Library, 201 N Mudd. Light snacks and refreshments will be

<strong>Library:</strong> Geology<br/>
<p>
ArcGIS Online is a geographic information system (GIS) that is used to
create, edit, visualize, and analyze spatial data—all in an online
cloud-based system, using only your browser. In this introduction,
you’ll get an overview of its features, how to access your organization
and how to connect to data sources, along with examples on how you can
create and share a map. Some basic knowledge of GIS concepts, such as
basemaps, layers and shapefiles is recommended, but not required. We
will not be performing any analysis. This class is only open to members
of the Caltech community that have a valid and current access credential
log-in. A log-in link to the Caltech GPS GIS organization will be
provided. Please note that we will not be covering ArcGIS Pro, ArcMap,
or other desktop versions.
