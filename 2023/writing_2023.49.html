What is life? That was the question that Carl Zimmer set out to answer
in his most recent book,
<a href="https://carlzimmer.com/books/lifes-edge/" target="_blank">Life’s
Edge: The Search For What It Means To Be Alive</a>. Most dictionary
definitions of the word "alive" define it as in opposition to being
dead. For example, "(of a person, animal, or plant) living, not dead."
This doesn't answer the question about the edge cases, such as viruses,
which "have long been a real puzzle for biologists about whether they're
alive or not. They have incredible screaming matches about whether these
things are alive or not. And they have been doing so for a century,
since they discovered viruses."
</p>
<p>
Scientists have attempted to define life, though they don't all agree.
"There are definitions of life, that actually have been published by
scientists and scientific journals. I say definitions, there are several
hundred definitions. And the number doesn't seem to be going down."
</p>
<p>
It seems obvious to most people what is alive or dead, but Carl looked
into this from a scientific perspective. "How do you know whether
something's alive or not? Are you relying on actual scientific
observation? Or is it more of an intuition? I would argue that we mostly
are just relying on intuition, whether things are alive or not, whether
people are alive or not. And sometimes, there are things that can
completely overturn our intuitions, things that are in a borderland
between life and death, between life and nonlife. The more that you
explore that gray zone, you start to realize that we really don't
understand life at all."
</p>
<p>
The question of defining life isn't that old; scientists and
philosophers only started exploring it in the 18th century. "What was
happening was that you had a scientific revolution that had changed how
we think about inanimate objects. Because we have physics, we can think
about matter in motion. This raised important questions about our own
bodies. What about ourselves? What about animals and plants? It seemed
like there was something that was fundamentally different between a rock
and a flower, and that something was life. But again, that doesn't
really tell you what life is. So in the 1700s, there were a lot of ideas
put forward about how life was all about some sort of vital force. There
were forces in the universe of gravity and so on, but there was some
other force, a vital force, and that vital force was inside living
things. And that allowed living things to do things that other objects
could not, to grow, to become complex, to reproduce, to make new copies
of themselves that are almost identical. All these things were made
possible by this vital force. And again, nobody could actually say what
the vital force was. But this whole view became known as vitalism."
</p>
<p>
Carl Zimmer is not a scientist, and got into science writing by the back
door. After an English major in college, he went to work at a science
magazine. "I just happened to get an entry-level job as an assistant
copy editor at a magazine that happened to be about science. I started
working on the stories, and I thought, this is really interesting, I'm
really enjoying this. Then I had the opportunity to grow in a position
to start fact-checking, writing, editing, and so on. Discover magazine
was a really great education, and I was there for 10 years in total. But
you certainly just don't wake up one day and become a science writer."
</p>
<p>
As we were chatting over Zoom, I noticed a table with several dozen
books piled up. Carl told me these were the remnants of the books he
researched for his current project. He enters all his research into his
Scrivener project. "Scrivener has been essential for me. I started
working seriously with Scrivener in 2016. I had written a number of
books already by that point, and there were a lot of things that were
painful about writing books. For example, you know, just organizing all
the reference material that you need for a book, and then organizing the
book itself. So I would make do largely with Microsoft Word. Word is
fine for shorter things, but it was a real hassle for working on big
projects like books. Once I figured out how Scrivener works, and how it
would work for me; I think I'm a visual person. So it really helps me to
be able to see the pieces of the book and scan up and down very quickly.
When I've been working with editors, often their best guidance has been
very structural, like saying this part doesn't belong here, these
chapters are out of order, these chapters should be split, or these
chapters should be fused, and so on. What I like with Scrivener is that
you can do that just by dragging around the different parts of the book.
And then you can look at it in terms of the sections and then just read
it in that new order. Just having that ability to move the pieces around
in Scrivener makes it incredibly valuable to me."

hide behind the safety of their laptops and the precious characters they
create. Actors, meanwhile, are extroverts who never sweat unless it’s
called for in the script, love being in front of people, and are happy
to vomit up all of their ugliest flaws for our close inspection.</span>
