Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1126 AM CST Thu Dec 21 2023

Valid 221200Z - 231200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
SOUTHERN ARIZONA AND FAR SOUTHWEST NEW MEXICO...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms will be possible Friday from southern California
across much of the Southwest. Some hail and strong/gusty winds may
occur over parts of southern Arizona and far southwest New Mexico
Friday afternoon and evening.

...Southwest...
A closed upper low initially centered off the coast of southern CA
will move eastward Friday across the northern Baja Peninsula and
lower CO River Valley. Large-scale ascent preceding this feature and
associated mid-level moisture will support showers and thunderstorms
from southern CA into much of the Southwest through the period.
Widespread cloudiness and limited low-level moisture should hinder
the development of much instability. But modest daytime heating and
cooling mid-level temperatures as the upper trough/low advances
eastward may aid weak buoyancy across parts of southern AZ and
vicinity by Friday afternoon.

Assuming this weak instability can develop, strengthening mid-level
southwesterly flow ahead of the upper trough/low will support
deep-layer shear increasing to 35-50 kt by late Friday afternoon and
early evening. Some guidance shows the potential for a supercell or
two to track northeastward from northern Mexico across parts of
southern AZ and perhaps into far southwest NM. If this occurs, then
isolated hail will be possible given cold mid-level temperatures and
favorable effective bulk shear. The potential for occasional
strong/gusty winds may also exist where the boundary layer can
become well mixed as low-level lapse rates steepen and modest
diurnal heating occurs. Overall confidence in severe potential
across parts of the Southwest Friday remains low, as instability is
expected to remain rather weak.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1041 AM CST Thu Dec 21 2023

Valid 211700Z - 221200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No changes. Increasing precipitation chances, combined with modest
winds and mild temperatures will keep fire-weather concerns minimal.

..Lyons.. 12/21/2023

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0101 AM CST Thu Dec 21 2023/

...Synopsis...
Multiple mid-level troughs will traverse the western and central
U.S. today, promoting appreciable precipitation accumulations over
California and the Southern Plains. Meanwhile, dry air will linger
over the Tennessee Valley into the Southeast. However, surface winds
are expected to be weak, limiting significant wildfire-spread
potential. Fire-weather conditions should also remain quiescent over
the rest of the CONUS as well.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1024 AM CST Thu Dec 21 2023

Valid 211630Z - 221200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated thunderstorms are possible today across parts of southern
California, southern Arizona and from north Texas into southeast
Kansas. Severe thunderstorms are not expected.

...Discussion...
Low-amplitude flow aloft will prevail across most of the U.S. today,
away from a developing closed low over the Canadian Maritimes, and a
second low that will remain just off the southern California/Baja
coast through the period.

Surface high pressure -- and associated cool/stable low-level
conditions -- will again encompass much of the country, limiting
convective potential over a majority of the CONUS. 

Two exceptions -- where isolated thunderstorms may occur -- include
southern portions of California and Arizona, ahead of the
aforementioned offshore upper low, and into portions of the
Kansas/Oklahoma/North Texas area, ahead of mid-level short-wave
troughing advancing eastward across this area through otherwise
weak/westerly flow.  In both areas, severe weather is not expected.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0631 AM CST Wed Dec 20 2023

Valid 201300Z - 211200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated thunderstorms will be possible across parts of
southern/central California and over portions of the Southwest. The
severe-thunderstorm threat appears low.

...CA to AZ/NM though tonight...
A midlevel low is expected to move slowly southward off the
central/southern CA coast through early Thursday, while a weak/lead
shortwave trough ejects northeastward over AZ/NM.  Some midlevel
convection occurred overnight across southern AZ in association with
the lead wave, where sufficient midlevel lapse rates/moisture
contributed to MUCAPE of 100-200 J/kg (rooted near 700 mb). 
Isolated thunderstorms will be possible through the day from
southeast AZ shifting eastward into NM.  Otherwise, the primary
baroclinic band will overspread the central CA coast today and
eventually reach the southern CA coast by tonight.  Isolated
thunderstorms will be possible near the coast through the period,
and across the San Joaquin Valley this afternoon.  Forecast wind
profiles suggest low potential for embedded organized/weakly
rotating storms just offshore, as observed south of San Francisco
this morning.  However, inland buoyancy should remain too marginal
to introduce any damaging wind and/or tornado probabilities.

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will meander along the West Coast as upper
ridging persists from the Interior West toward the Appalachians
tomorrow/Tuesday. While surface lee troughing is expected across the
High Plains, surface high pressure and associated cooler air should
dominate over the rest of the CONUS. Similar to Day 1, quiescent
fire weather conditions are expected over the U.S.

Mesoscale Discussion 2333
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1106 AM CST Sun Dec 17 2023

Areas affected...parts of the coastal Carolinas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 171706Z - 172100Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...A conditional risk of brief tornadoes or damaging gusts is
forecast today, from the South Carolina upper coast toward coastal
North Carolina. The risk is conditional on air mass recovery, and a
watch may be considered.

DISCUSSION...A surface low will deepen as it moves northeastward off
the SC Coast today, along an existing baroclinic zone which is
currently well offshore. Surface observations show cool air over
land with gusty northeast winds, and this will likely maintain a
decoupled boundary layer which should mitigate tornado and damaging
gust potential in the near term.

Later today, gradual warming is expected as the warm front shifts
north along the coast. As winds veer to east and then southeast, a
warmer and more unstable air mass will then support a risk of brief
tornadoes and damaging gusts, as shear will remain strong along the
warm front. Observational trends will continue to be monitored
closely, along with satellite imagery, to ascertain when a potential
watch may be needed later today.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 722
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
150 PM EST Sun Dec 17 2023

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  eastern North Carolina
  Coastal Waters

* Effective this Sunday afternoon and evening from 150 PM until
  800 PM EST.

* Primary threats include...
  A few tornadoes and a couple intense tornadoes possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 65 mph possible

SUMMARY...Potential for locally damaging winds and a couple of
tornadoes will gradually increase this afternoon and into this
evening, as locally intense thunderstorms shift north-northeastward
across the North Carolina Coastal Plain and Outer Banks area.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 45 statute miles
east and west of a line from 110 miles northeast of New Bern NC to
30 miles south of Wilmington NC. For a complete depiction of the
watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU2).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 0.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 55 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 400. Mean
storm motion vector 18040.
