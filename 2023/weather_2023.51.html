Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1254 PM CST Mon Dec 18 2023

Valid 191200Z - 201200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

Fire-weather concerns are minimal. See the previous discussion.

..Lyons.. 12/18/2023

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0147 AM CST Mon Dec 18 2023/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will meander along the West Coast as upper
ridging persists from the Interior West toward the Appalachians
tomorrow/Tuesday. While surface lee troughing is expected across the
High Plains, surface high pressure and associated cooler air should
dominate over the rest of the CONUS. Similar to Day 1, quiescent
fire weather conditions are expected over the U.S.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1106 AM CST Mon Dec 18 2023

Valid 191200Z - 201200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected on Tuesday.

...Synopsis...

An upper trough over the eastern U.S. will move offshore the
Atlantic coast on Tuesday. In its wake, upper ridging will envelop
much of the CONUS. Meanwhile, another upper trough/closed low over
the eastern Pacific will approach the CA coast by Wednesday morning.
Strong surface high pressure building over much of the eastern half
of the CONUS will result in stable conditions. Southwesterly flow
aloft ahead of the Pacific upper low will maintain a stream of
midlevel moisture into central/northern CA. A few deeper convective
elements may support isolated lightning flashes along the coast and
into the valleys of central/northern CA, especially during the
overnight into early Wednesday morning hours. Severe storms are not
expected.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1017 AM CST Mon Dec 18 2023

Valid 181700Z - 191200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No changes. Cool temperatures and abundant precipitation will keep
fire-weather conditions minimal over much of the CONUS.

..Lyons.. 12/18/2023

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0146 AM CST Mon Dec 18 2023/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will amplify along the East Coast as a second
mid-level trough impinges on California, with abundant rainfall
expected in both regions today. Meanwhile, surface high pressure and
associated cooler air will overspread the central CONUS. The net
result will be quiescent fire weather conditions across the U.S.,
especially considering that fuels will be poorly receptive to
wildfire spread for many locales.

1013 AM CST Mon Dec 18 2023

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS
SOUTHEASTERN NEW ENGLAND...

...SUMMARY...
Convectively enhanced wind gusts will affect southeastern New
England this afternoon.

...Southeastern New England..
A narrow/forced band of convection is moving quickly eastward across
southeastern Massachusetts and Rhode Island at this time,
immediately ahead of a strong, northeastward-moving mid-level vort
max depicted by water vapor imagery just south of Long Island.

While cool surface temperatures have prohibited surface-based
instability in most areas, a small area of warmer (low 60s) boundary
layer is indicated over far southeastern New England (southeast
Massachusetts).  As such, minor enhancement of the intensity of the
convective band may occur over the next couple of hours, possibly
resulting in some mechanical downward transport of intense low-level
flow observed across this area.  This could result in gusts slightly
above the already above-severe level gradient gusts that are
ongoing, until convection moves offshore later this afternoon.  For
additional short-term information, please refer to SWOMCD #2337.

...California...

Thunderstorms associated with an inland-moving eastern Pacific
short-wave trough have diminished across California, but a few
additional lightning flashes remain possible this afternoon/
evening.

Mesoscale Discussion 2333
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1106 AM CST Sun Dec 17 2023

Areas affected...parts of the coastal Carolinas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 171706Z - 172100Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...A conditional risk of brief tornadoes or damaging gusts is
forecast today, from the South Carolina upper coast toward coastal
North Carolina. The risk is conditional on air mass recovery, and a
watch may be considered.

DISCUSSION...A surface low will deepen as it moves northeastward off
the SC Coast today, along an existing baroclinic zone which is
currently well offshore. Surface observations show cool air over
land with gusty northeast winds, and this will likely maintain a
decoupled boundary layer which should mitigate tornado and damaging
gust potential in the near term.

Later today, gradual warming is expected as the warm front shifts
north along the coast. As winds veer to east and then southeast, a
warmer and more unstable air mass will then support a risk of brief
tornadoes and damaging gusts, as shear will remain strong along the
warm front. Observational trends will continue to be monitored
closely, along with satellite imagery, to ascertain when a potential
watch may be needed later today.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 722
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
150 PM EST Sun Dec 17 2023

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  eastern North Carolina
  Coastal Waters

* Effective this Sunday afternoon and evening from 150 PM until
  800 PM EST.

* Primary threats include...
  A few tornadoes and a couple intense tornadoes possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 65 mph possible

SUMMARY...Potential for locally damaging winds and a couple of
tornadoes will gradually increase this afternoon and into this
evening, as locally intense thunderstorms shift north-northeastward
across the North Carolina Coastal Plain and Outer Banks area.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 45 statute miles
east and west of a line from 110 miles northeast of New Bern NC to
30 miles south of Wilmington NC. For a complete depiction of the
watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU2).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 0.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 55 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 400. Mean
storm motion vector 18040.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0646 AM CST Sun Dec 17 2023

Valid 171300Z - 181200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THROUGH TONIGHT
ACROSS THE COASTAL CAROLINAS...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated damaging gusts and a tornado or two will be possible
through tonight across the coastal Carolinas.

...Coastal Carolinas through tonight...
A deepening cyclone will progress from north FL this morning to
eastern NC by 09-12z Monday, in response to gradual phasing of Gulf
of Mexico shortwave troughs with a larger-scale trough over the
eastern CONUS.  Midlevel drying with the passage of a lead shortwave
trough and diminished ascent have acted to limit deep convection
across FL overnight.  Any lingering severe threat will end across
southeast FL by mid-late morning as drying occurs from the west and
vertical shear continues to weaken.  The cyclone will skirt the GA
coast during the day and then approach SC this afternoon and NC
tonight.  A narrow portion of the surface warm sector could spread
far enough inland to support some threat for near-surface-based
convection across the coastal Carolinas, where vertical shear will
be strong.  However, poor lapse rates aloft will tend to limit
buoyancy in the zone of stronger forcing for ascent where vertical
shear will be strongest, and cool shelf waters will likely maintain
a shallow stable layer near the coast.  Will maintain the outlook
area given the conditional potential for isolated damaging gusts and
a tornado or two, but it is not clear how much of the potential will
be realized inland.

...Northern CA coast...
To the east of a closed low over the eastern Pacific, isolated
lightning flashes will be possible with embedded/elevated
convection.
