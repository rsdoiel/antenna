Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0631 AM CST Wed Dec 20 2023

Valid 201300Z - 211200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated thunderstorms will be possible across parts of
southern/central California and over portions of the Southwest. The
severe-thunderstorm threat appears low.

...CA to AZ/NM though tonight...
A midlevel low is expected to move slowly southward off the
central/southern CA coast through early Thursday, while a weak/lead
shortwave trough ejects northeastward over AZ/NM.  Some midlevel
convection occurred overnight across southern AZ in association with
the lead wave, where sufficient midlevel lapse rates/moisture
contributed to MUCAPE of 100-200 J/kg (rooted near 700 mb). 
Isolated thunderstorms will be possible through the day from
southeast AZ shifting eastward into NM.  Otherwise, the primary
baroclinic band will overspread the central CA coast today and
eventually reach the southern CA coast by tonight.  Isolated
thunderstorms will be possible near the coast through the period,
and across the San Joaquin Valley this afternoon.  Forecast wind
profiles suggest low potential for embedded organized/weakly
rotating storms just offshore, as observed south of San Francisco
this morning.  However, inland buoyancy should remain too marginal
to introduce any damaging wind and/or tornado probabilities.

Mesoscale Discussion 2333
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1106 AM CST Sun Dec 17 2023

Areas affected...parts of the coastal Carolinas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 171706Z - 172100Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...A conditional risk of brief tornadoes or damaging gusts is
forecast today, from the South Carolina upper coast toward coastal
North Carolina. The risk is conditional on air mass recovery, and a
watch may be considered.

DISCUSSION...A surface low will deepen as it moves northeastward off
the SC Coast today, along an existing baroclinic zone which is
currently well offshore. Surface observations show cool air over
land with gusty northeast winds, and this will likely maintain a
decoupled boundary layer which should mitigate tornado and damaging
gust potential in the near term.

Later today, gradual warming is expected as the warm front shifts
north along the coast. As winds veer to east and then southeast, a
warmer and more unstable air mass will then support a risk of brief
tornadoes and damaging gusts, as shear will remain strong along the
warm front. Observational trends will continue to be monitored
closely, along with satellite imagery, to ascertain when a potential
watch may be needed later today.

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  eastern North Carolina
  Coastal Waters

* Effective this Sunday afternoon and evening from 150 PM until
  800 PM EST.

* Primary threats include...
  A few tornadoes and a couple intense tornadoes possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 65 mph possible

SUMMARY...Potential for locally damaging winds and a couple of
tornadoes will gradually increase this afternoon and into this
evening, as locally intense thunderstorms shift north-northeastward
across the North Carolina Coastal Plain and Outer Banks area.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 45 statute miles
east and west of a line from 110 miles northeast of New Bern NC to
30 miles south of Wilmington NC. For a complete depiction of the
watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU2).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 0.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
