Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0724 PM CDT Sat Oct 14 2023

Valid 150100Z - 151200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe weather threat has ended over the eastern North Carolina
vicinty.  Severe storms are not expected across the U.S. through the
remainder of the period.

...Discussion...
A surface low now in the vicinity of southern portions of the
Chesapeake Bay will move offshore this evening, as mid-level
short-wave troughing continues to move eastward across the central
Appalachians.  Earlier warm-sector convection over far eastern North
Carolina and the Outer Banks has moved offshore, and with it, any
potential for stronger storms.  As such, MRGL risk is being removed
from the outlook at this time.  A few lightning strikes will remain
possible, however, across portions of the Mid-Atlantic region
through this evening.

Elsewhere, a few thunderstorms may persist this evening over South
Florida, while lightning is not expected across the remainder of the
CONUS through 15/12Z.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0458 PM CDT Sat Oct 14 2023

Valid 161200Z - 221200Z

The beginning of the extended forecast period will feature a large
high pressure center across the Plains. A mid-level shortwave trough
over the Pacific Northwest on Monday will traverse the top of the
ridge across the northern Rockies and amplify as it moves southeast
into the eastern CONUS. As this occurs, an area of surface
low-pressure will develop across the Plains and eventually move into
the eastern CONUS. Breezy conditions will accompany this surface
low, but relatively cool temperatures should keep relative humidity
somewhat higher. Fuels remain moist across much of the CONUS,
particularly where the dry and breezy conditions will be present.
Therefore, fire weather concerns should remain minimal for the
extended period.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THROUGH EARLY
EVENING ACROSS COASTAL NORTH CAROLINA AND FAR SOUTHEAST VIRGINIA...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated strong/damaging gusts and a brief tornado are possible
through early evening over portions of coastal North Carolina and
far southern Virginia.

...Coastal NC/southeast VA...

Only minor adjustments have been made to the Marginal (level 1 of 5)
risk area, mainly across NC, based on current location of the
surface low and cold front. Some modest cumulus development has
occurred along the front as weak destabilization occurs in a narrow
corridor behind early showers/convection. A few strong storms
producing locally strong gusts or a brief spin-up will remain
possible through early evening.

..Leitman.. 10/14/2023

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1117 AM CDT Sat Oct 14 2023/

Across the CONUS, moderate mid-level zonal flow, punctuated by
several shortwave troughs, will slowly amplify through the forecast
period. A broad upper low over the eastern Canadian Maritimes will
retrograde westward while the primary positive tilt shortwave trough
over the OH Valley deepens. A second vort max over the northern
Plains will impinge on the western flank of the OH Valley shortwave
further deepening the conglomerate into a broad upper low over the
eastern US by the end of the forecast period. Behind the amplifying
upper low, broad ridging will develop over the western US. At the
surface, a broad area of low pressure over the OH Valley was
trailing a cold front south toward the central Gulf Coast. A cool
and stable post-frontal air mass within high pressure over much of
the central and western CONUS will shunt thunderstorm probabilities
eastward toward the Atlantic Coast. A second coastal low near the
Carolinas will gradually move inland marking the effective edge of
the remaining warm sector and isolated severe thunderstorm chances
for today outside of the southern FL peninsula.

...Coastal North Carolina into far southern Virginia....
As the broad upper low over the eastern CONUS deepens, the primary
shortwave over southern OH will shift southeastward overspreading
much of the middle Atlantic Coast. Deep-layer ascent from the
shortwave and moderate westerly flow will allow the coastal low to
deepen slightly as it moves inland over portions of eastern NC and
southern VA. Warm and moist surface flow (dewpoints in the upper
60s-70s F) should support a narrow, weakly unstable warm sector
along the immediate coast through the afternoon. Ongoing cloud cover
and modest to poor mid-level lapse rates will continue to limit
buoyancy, but by early afternoon a few cloud brakes and inland warm
advection will allow for weak destabilization of (500-1000 J/kg
MUCAPE). This may support a few stronger updrafts as storms develop
near the surface triple point while it moves into eastern portions
of NC and eventually far southern VA. Despite limited buoyancy,
deep-layer shear is favorable for storm organization into short
linear segments and perhaps supercells. Strong lower tropospheric
flow and water loading atop neutral lapse rates may support a few
damaging wind gusts with the strongest storms. Clockwise curved, but
relatively modest sized low-level hodographs may also allow for
low-level updraft rotation and the potential for a brief tornado,
especially with any sustained supercell structures over coastal
parts of NC. While confidence in severe coverage is not overly high,
isolated severe storms are possible for a few hours this afternoon
as the low deepens before moving offshore this evening.

...OH Valley...
As the broad surface low slowly merges with the secondary coastal
low this afternoon, weak mid-level warm advection along and east of
an occluding front may support low-topped thunderstorms from eastern
OH into parts of the central Appalachians. With buoyancy generally
below 250 J/kg owing to cooler and drier surface conditions, storms
are not expected to be strong or organized. However, abundant
vertical vorticity beneath the upper low and along the wind
shift/frontal zone may support a few funnel clouds or small
hail/graupel with the more sustained updrafts. Given the lack of
greater severe potential owing to little buoyancy and shear, no
Marginal Risk will be introduced.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1250 AM CDT Sat Oct 14 2023/

...Synopsis...
High pressure will continue across the western and central US with
troughing across the eastern US on Sunday. An impulse rotating
through the eastern trough will increase northerly gradients across
the Great Plains into the Ohio and Mississippi River Valleys.
Northerly breezes will be possible, but generally cool temperatures,
higher relative humidity, and moist fuels will keep the risk of fire
spread low. Relative humidity across Louisiana may drop as low as
35-40 percent amid sustained winds around 15 mph. Brief pockets of
Elevated fire-weather concerns may be possible. Latest fuel guidance
suggests fuels within this region are moist from recent rainfall,
which precludes the need to add areas at this time.

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected on Sunday.

...Synopsis...

A deepening large-scale upper trough will pivot eastward across the
eastern U.S. on Sunday. An area of stronger mid/upper flow will
envelop the Gulf Coast and Southeast regions associated with the jet
max evolving through the base and eastern sides of the trough. A
surface low will be located offshore from the Mid-Atlantic/southern
New England coast, with an attendant cold front offshore the from
the Carolinas and southeast GA. The southern extent of the front
will arc southwest across central FL into the central/southern Gulf
of Mexico. As the front sags southward across the FL Peninsula,
ample boundary-layer moisture will be in place. Stronger
destabilization will be limited to the Keys and FL Straits, with
weaker instability possible across far southern portions of the
Peninsula, mainly due to warm temperatures aloft. A few
thunderstorms will be possible through the afternoon. However,
severe potential is not expected. Thunderstorm activity is not
expected elsewhere across the CONUS.

..Bentley.. 10/14/2023

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1248 AM CDT Sat Oct 14 2023/

...Synopsis...
Fire-weather concerns will remain low across the CONUS today.
Building high pressure across the western/central US will lead to
generally light winds where the driest conditions are progged to
continue. Pockets of breezy post-frontal northwesterly flow will be
possible across the central/southern Plains into the southeast, but
moist fuels and cool temperatures will mitigate the risk of fire
spread.

Across central/southern Louisiana, breezy northwest flow will bring
relative humidity reductions to around 30-35%. HREF conditional
probability of sustained Elevated/Critical conditions remains low,
with fuel data indicating fuels may not be receptive to fire spread
due to recent rainfall in the last 7-14 days. This region remains in
severe to exceptional drought, which leads to some uncertainty on
potential effect of drought stress on fuels. Given the low
probability of sustained Elevated to Critical conditions, no areas
were included with this outlook.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PORTIONS OF
EASTERN NORTH CAROLINA...

...SUMMARY...
Potential exists for damaging to marginally severe gusts and/or a
tornado today over portions of eastern North Carolina.

...Synopsis...
Over the CONUS, amplification of the mean mid/upper-level pattern is
expected through the period, as a ridge builds over the West, and a
series of shortwave troughs contributes to net height falls and
cyclonic flow over a broad area from the Gulf Coast to the Great
Lakes and Atlantic Seaboard.  The two strongest of those shortwave
troughs are apparent in moisture-channel imagery over:
1.  Portions of WI/IL/MO, with a weak 500-mb low over northern IL. 
This feature will continue to devolve to an open-wave trough and
lose amplitude, crossing the upper Ohio Valley and central
Appalachians early this evening, then the Mid-Atlantic Coast around
06-9Z.
2.  Western SD initially, with an at least intermittently closed
500-mb low moving southeastward to east-central NE by 00Z, then
southwestern MO around 12Z tomorrow.

Approach of the leading mid/upper perturbation will strengthen an
initially weak, frontal-wave surface low, analyzed at 11Z over
eastern SC between SSC-CHS at 11Z.  A cold front was analyzed from
that low south-southeastward across Atlantic waters then bending
southwestward over south-central FL to the central Gulf.  An
occluded front extended from the SC low into a broad area of low
pressure over OH/IN/IL, under and ahead of the midlevel circulation
center.  A warm front was drawn from the SC low northeastward along
or just south of the southern coast of NC and past HSE.  A shallow
stable layer in the 12Z MHX RAOB, with light southeast winds,
indicated the boundary was just south of there, near the immediate
beaches.  The warm front should spread inland through the afternoon,
but probably in a diffuse and erratic manner because of precip to
its north.  By 00Z the coastal low and warm front should move
northeastward to near Cape Charles/southernmost Delmarva region,
with cold front southward over easternmost NC.  This low and the
warm front should shift offshore thereafter. 

...Eastern NC...
Ongoing precip is apparent in irregularly sized patches over the
eastern Carolinas, especially NC.  Little or no thunder has occurred
in the last few hours, likely related to a layer of poor midlevel
lapse rates well-sampled by the 12Z CHS sounding.  This activity,
and associated areas of clouds/precip, will substantially limit
diabatic heating for much of the day across the outlook area.
However, the low-level airmass in the cloud/precip area, while
characterized by stable to neutral lapse rates initially, only needs
weak heating and warm/moist advection to yield enough theta-e for
surface-based effective-inflow parcels to overcome the weak midlevel
lapse rates.  That should occur, with upper 60s to low 70s F surface
dewpoints spreading northward/inland over eastern NC east through
southeast of the low.  500-1000 J/kg MLCAPE is possible in a narrow
plume ahead of the cold front, which also may support a conditional
second round of convection along the front, in a broken arc. 
Effective-shear magnitudes of 45-55 kt suggest some of the
convection may become supercellular -- especially whatever can
remain discrete through maturity.

In both cases (leading plume and possible frontal follow-up),
forecast soundings suggest hodographs will be well-curved but not
particularly large, leading to marginal SRH with values such as: 
effective and 0-3 km of 100-300 J/kg, and 0-1-km of 75-150 J/kg. 
Vorticity enhancement along favorably positioned outflow/
differential-heating boundaries may contribute to some local maxima
in storm-scale rotation and tornado potential, but this threat
appears quite conditional and isolated.  The most intense cells also
may produce damaging winds, and a severe gust cannot be ruled out.
