going strong after 50 years</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>The PARC facility also is known for the invention of Ethernet, a
networking technology that allows high-speed data transmission over
coaxial cables. Ethernet has become the standard wired local area
network around the world, and it is widely used in businesses and homes.
It was honored this year as an IEEE Milestone, a half century after it
was born. Truly one of the success stories of the technology world.
Sure, those first Ethernet cables and accessories have changed a lot
over the decades, but we’re still using it to this day, and we’ll be
using it for many more decades to come.</p>

deprecates even more Windows features, Steps Recorder gets the axe</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>Shortly after announcing the end of three services, one of which is
as old as MS-DOS, Microsoft deprecated the Tips app. Now, another
utility is about to get the axe: Microsoft has updated its Windows
documentation again, detailing the end of the story for Steps Recorder
(psr.exe). Steps Recorder is an old utility from the Windows 7 era that
lets you, as the name implies, record your steps while doing something
in Windows. Although long abandoned, Steps Recorder is a handy tool for
describing to your grandma how to perform specific actions in Windows,
troubleshoot apps, or report bugs. Steps Recorder is simple and very
effective, and you can launch it by pressing Win + R and typing psr.
With Windows being as massively popular as it is, even removals of
weird, obscure utilities and services that small percentages of Windows
users used, still means hundreds of thousands of people can be affected.
So, let’s pour one out for psr.</p>

<p>OpenAI (Hacker News): Sam Altman will depart as CEO and leave the

review process by the board, which concluded that he was not
consistently candid in his communications with the board, hindering its

starting to work with people on <i>artcasting.</i> The idea is we want
to send visual art over RSS 2.0 feeds. Photographs. Paintings. News. The
consensus seems to be that we should use the
<a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html#ltenclosuregtSubelementOfLtitemgt">enclosure</a>
element, as with podcasting. In this case, if the type begins with
“image/” then an <i>artcast</i> viewer should handle it, and others
should ignore it. We were at this place with podcasting in 2001, and
needed some examples, so we had a feed of
<a href="http://scripting.com/misc/fromDaveOfsCom/rss/gratefulDead.xml">Grateful
Dead music</a> to start using the technology. There’s a big difference
between an idea and something you can use. So anyway, here’s the
artcasting <a href="http://scripting.com/misc/artfeed.xml">test
feed</a>. Try subscribing to it in a feed reader you like. Hopefully it
either ignores the enclosure or it does the right thing with it,
displays it. Here’s a

<p>
In a rare squid/security post, here’s an
<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/10/13/squid_proxy_bugs_remain_unfixed/">article</a>
about unpatched vulnerabilities in the Squid caching proxy.

<p>date: 2023-11-17, from: NASA breaking news</p>
<p>Since launching 16 months ago, the EMIT imaging spectrometer aboard
the International Space Station has shown an ability to detect more than
just surface minerals. More than a year after first detecting methane
plumes from its perch aboard the International Space Station, data from
NASA’s EMIT instrument is now being used to identify point-source

Raspberry Pis are often integrated into small robotics and IoT products—or used to analyze live video feeds with &lt;a href=&quot;https://frigate.video&quot;&gt;Frigate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
Until today, nobody I know of has been able to get a PCI Express Coral
TPU working on the Raspberry Pi. The Compute Module 4, unfortunately,
had some quirks in its PCIe implementation, preventing the use of the
Coral over PCIe.

</p>
<p>
The Raspberry Pi 5 has a much improved PCIe bus—capable of reaching Gen
3 speeds even!—and I’ve already tested the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXWu4SUsaY8">first PCIe NVMe
HATs for Pi 5</a>.
</p>
<p>
So can the Pi 5 handle the Coral TPU natively over PCIe?
</p>
<p>
<em>Yes</em>. Though currently, you need to tweak a few things to get it
working.

<p>
And the Linux kernel uses a method called
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/devicetree/usage-model.html">Device

are stored as <code>.dtb</code> files inside the

major Raspberry Pi hardware model.

I’ve had to modify the <code>dtb</code> files in the past to

Complaint</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-17, updated: 2023-11-17, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
A ransomware gang, annoyed at not being paid,
<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-gang-files-sec-complaint-over-victims-undisclosed-breach/">filed
an SEC complaint</a> against its victim for not disclosing its security
breach within the required four days.
</p>
<p>
This is over the top, but is just another example of the extreme
pressure ransomware gangs put on companies after seizing their data.
Gangs are now going through the data, looking for particularly important
or embarrassing pieces of data to threaten executives with exposing. I
have heard stories of executives’ families being threatened, of
consensual porn being identified (people regularly mix work and personal
email) and exposed, and of victims’ customers and partners being
directly contacted. Ransoms are in the millions, and gangs do their best
to ensure that the pressure to pay is intense…

<p>A little more than a year ago, a NASA flight test article came
screaming back from space at more than 18,000 mph, reaching temperatures
of nearly 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit before gently splashing down in the

transition to Manifest V3</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>With these changes in place, we’ve seen support for Manifest V3
increase significantly among the extension developer community.
Specifically, we are encouraged by our ongoing dialogue with the
developers of content blocking extensions, who initially felt Manifest
V3 could impact their ability to provide users with the features they’ve
come to expect. Google has made several changes to Manifest V3
specifically to ease concerns among developers of content blocking
extensions, and it seems those changes have been positively received.
The maximum number of active rulesets has been increased, as well as the
number of dynamic rules, which are rules ad blocker developers can
change and update without having to update the extension as a whole.
Regardless of these changes, I would still advise everyone to get a
Raspberry Pi or whatever and run Pi-Hole – this will block ads for your
entire network, and all devices, regardless of browser or operating
system.</p>

<p>date: 2023-11-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>The rumors are true: Microsoft has built its own custom AI chip that
can be used to train large language models and potentially avoid a
costly reliance on Nvidia. Microsoft has also built its own Arm-based
CPU for cloud workloads. Both custom silicon chips are designed to power
its Azure data centers and ready the company and its enterprise
customers for a future full of AI. Microsoft’s Azure Maia AI chip and
Arm-powered Azure Cobalt CPU are arriving in 2024, on the back of a
surge in demand this year for Nvidia’s H100 GPUs that are widely used to
train and operate generative image tools and large language models.
There’s such high demand for these GPUs that some have even fetched more
than $40,000 on eBay. Amazon and Google, the two other major cloud
providers, are already using all kinds of custom, in-house silicon in
their datacentres, so it’s not exactly surprising Microsoft is following
in their footsteps.</p>

<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Let's start from the basics: can you introduce
yourself?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I’m Chris Coyier. Professionally, I’m the co-founder of CodePen, along
with Alex Vazquez. We’re over 10 years on that project and are hard at
work still today, evolving it. With my friend Dave Rupert, I co-host a
podcast called ShopTalk Show which is all about web design &amp;
development. I also used to run a blog called CSS-Tricks for 15 years,
which I sold a little over a year ago. So my professional life has been
very focused on the web. Outside of work, I hang out with my family in
Bend, Oregon. My main hobby is playing old-time music with local
friends.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>What's the story behind your blog?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I think I originally bought
<a href="http://chriscoyier.net/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">ChrisCoyier.net</a>
just out of the general obviousness that people should have a personal
website (I think most people should). A lot of my early website-building
experience involved WordPress, so I chucked that up on it. WordPress is
pretty capable for a variety of types of websites, but I do still think
the design of it encourages use as a blog. Blogging kinda clicked with
me anyway, so that was always a part of it. There is something
intoxicating about writing and publishing something anyone in the world
can see and read.
</p>
<p>
I have no idea how many times it’s been redesigned over the years! It’s
my 8th design since I’ve been properly versioning my WordPress theme,
but surely a few before that. And honestly: not enough. Redesigning your
personal website is one of life’s great pleasures.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>What does your creative process look like when it comes to
blogging?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
Ideally, I’m asking myself: what is interesting about this? Is there a
hook to this that makes this worthwhile? What can I say about this that
might make it click for someone? Can I share how it clicked for me? Can
I be helpful in some other way?
</p>
<p>
But sometimes I just don’t care. I remember one time a very popular
blogger posting to say that it was his wife’s birthday, and noting that
it was a good reminder that blogs are never that serious and you should
be able to post whatever you want whenever you want to. That’s what
makes a good blog, I think. That is to say, usually, I try to make
things interesting for everyone, but it’s good enough if it’s
interesting just to me.
</p>
<p>
My writing process has always been rather hot’n’fast. I might make a few
passes during writing to rejigger things, but usually, I get done with
things same-day and just hit the publish button. Back in the CSS-Tricks
days, I had a great editor in Geoff Graham, so I probably seemed a
little more polished than usual, but even then, it’s not like either of
us were super professional editors and spent weeks on things. I think
that might take the fun out of writing for me.
</p>
<p>
Tools-wise, I think the most important thing for me is
<a href="https://chriscoyier.net/2023/08/20/how-do-i-save-links-for-later/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">saving
links</a> and then being able to look over them and think about them and
see if any thoughts have formulated about them since saving/reading
them.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe
the physical space influences your creativity?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
Nah, not really. What I do think is helpful is scenery changes. I’ve got
a great desk and I can do the majority of my work there, but sometimes I
like to take a laptop over to a coffee shop just to switch it up a bit
and usually combine that with changing gears with what I’m working on.
</p>
<p>
But I’ve blogged just fine in my parent’s unfinished basement, in a tiny
room with a tilted floor and unreliable internet in a house of
questionably employed late twenty somethings, from a pool bar at a
resort in Costa Rica, in lonely second story flat with a creaky floor,
from the sunroom of a house in Florida that was a little too big for
just one dude and a puppy, from a coffeeshop I’d never find again in
Kraków, from a ferry on the inside passages of Southeast Alaska, and
from a glass-walled office with my hand-picked inspirational art
surrounding me. You just need a laptop, an idea, and a little desire to
press publish.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your
tech stack?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
GoDaddy gets a lot of flack for an ex-CEO and a story involving killing
an elephant and a purportedly objectifying advertising campaign. I think
those things are more complicated than they seem on the surface, and
never convinced me the company as a whole was evil. I find GoDaddy to be
a pretty good domain registrant product, actually. I think the UI is
fairly sensible, the pricing acceptable, and, well, it just works well.
I used MediaTemple hosting for a long time, and I even thought they did
pretty well running that post-acquisition for quite a while. Most
importantly to me, though, as a loyal guy, GoDaddy once went to bat for
me when, through a complex social engineering attack, I had a website
stolen from me. It was no small effort for them to get it back, they
did, and protected the heck out of it for all the years after. Anyway:
my domains are there.
</p>
<p>
As I mentioned, I like WordPress, and I’m using Flywheel hosting for
that at the moment. I find the hosting and the support pretty good. But
my favorite feature is that they make this product
<a href="https://localwp.com/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Local</a>
for great local development.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would
you do anything differently?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I think the most important thing anyone can do when setting up a
blogging tech stack is to make sure it’s very easy to write and publish.
For a lot of techy folks, that’s Markdown and committing a file, and
that’s great. I’m a big fan of the static-site-generator approach to
site building, as there is just tons of advantages there to being low
cost, secure, easy to move around, lots of control, etc.
</p>
<p>
But me, I’m still a big fan of WordPress. I just have so much muscle
memory for how it works. Now that the Block Editor is a thing in
WordPress, I’m an even bigger fan. It allows you to do just enough
customization inside of a blog post that makes it feel right. Too much
customization would make redesigns obnoxious. Too little feels stifling
and would lead to too much one-off fighting against it. The Block Editor
allows you to, for example, set up some side-by-side columns, or drop in
a photo gallery, or adjust some one-off colors just for one part.
</p>
<p>
Everybody’s gotta do what works for them, though. Building your own
stack of tech and learning it deeply is part of the journey. You’ll
never love every single aspect of it, so be ready to evolve.<br /> I
would say: be liberal in how you syndicate. Your blog on the web can be
home base, but meet any reader where they are. Push that content to
anywhere that will take it.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Financial question since the web is obsessed with money: how
much does it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost or does it
generate some revenue? And what's your position on people monetising
personal blogs?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I don’t monetize my personal blog at the moment aside from putting a big
obvious “Go PRO on CodePen” link in various spots. I don’t, like, pay
myself directly for that placement or even track its effectiveness, but
it’s an ad, and as a co-owner of CodePen, I profit from that.
</p>
<p>
I don’t mind what people choose to monetize, go nuts. I’ve always
thought it can be done tastefully and be the best monetization option
for tons of sites. The fact that it craps up a ton of websites is
unfortunate, so, don’t do that. I do think people, generally, will have
a hard time making meaningful money from a personal website. The scale
is generally just a little too small to make it work, and the fact that
it’s just some-persons-name.com might just be a bit too niche and weird
for a many direct advertisers to bother. I’m sure there are
counter-examples, like people that do self-help stuff and monetize with
memberships or downloads or something. CSS-Tricks did OK with
advertising revenue, but it was a real grind getting enough content
produced on a daily basis to keep traffic up to the point of supporting
just an editor and a few writers.
</p>
<p>
If you need a zero-dollar option, WordPress.com has a free plan that’s
easy to grow out of (I swear WordPress doesn’t pay me, uhm, anymore).
But also picking a static site generator and using Netlify’s free plan
is totally an option. If you have any budget at all, buy a domain and
keep it up over the years. I’m very sure you’ll never regret that.
</p>
</div>

<h3>
Citation
</h3>
2023 marks a significant date for the LOCKSS Program: It is the
twenty-fifth anniversary of the friendly hikes in Joseph Grant State
Park and Big Basin where Victoria Reich and Dr. David S.R.[sic]
Rosenthal first conceived of LOCKSS, “lots of copies keeps stuff safe,”
as a guiding principle for long-term access and preservation to digital
library resources. It is also the twentieth anniversary of the
transition of the LOCKSS project from beta testing in 2002 to full
production release. In the words of the duo’s nominator, “Even if you
don’t know David Rosenthal and Vicky Reich by name, you’ve almost
certainly heard their rallying cry for digital preservation: Lots Of
Copies Keep Stuff Safe. This ethos has informed digital preservation
best practices since its introduction, and has shaped the design and
implementation of the LOCKSS open-source software.”<br /> <br /> David
Rosenthal and Vicky Reich’s brainchild—and the enduring preservation
networks that it has made possible—was at the leading edge of a global
wave of digital preservation initiatives in the early 20th century. The
effectiveness and reliability of LOCKSS software has been validated
through rigorous third-party evaluation, including ongoing certification
of the CLOCKSS archive as a trustworthy digital repository under the
TRAC standard since 2014. The LOCKSS project has provided enduring proof
of the concept that large-scale digital preservation work can be
accomplished cost-effectively and with community benefits (not vendor
profits) as the primary driver.<br /> <br /> Rosenthal and Reich’s work
on LOCKSS stands as a benchmark against which other approaches to
digital preservation and persistent access to digital resources are
measured. <br />
<h3>
Response
</h3>
The LOCKSS Program was
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2023/10/lockss-program-turns-25.html">25
years old</a> last month. Vicky and David would like to thank:<br />
<ul>
<li>
The international user community and Stanford staff who are using,
evolving and improving the software.
</li>
<li>
Our far sighted funders who got the program up and running —
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Lesk">Michael Lesk</a> at
the NSF and then
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2019/08/a-tribute-to-don-waters.html">Don
Waters</a> at the Mellon Foundation.
</li>
<li>
And three brilliant Stanford Computer Science PhD students who provided
the <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/945445.945451">award winning
science</a> behind the technology — Mema Roussopoulos, Petros Maniatis
and TJ Giuli.
</li>
</ul>
We learned many lessons over the two decades we worked on the program,
none of them a surprise to anyone in the preservation business. Two that
are key. For a program to survive the long term it is critical to:<br />
<ul>
<li>
Build and nurture relationships, among the staff, among the user
community, and with the funders.
</li>
<li>
Document, document, document. Write it down, whatever it is. Over a
quarter-century it is easy to forget things such as “why was it done
this way?”.
</li>
</ul>
<p>We are honored by and grateful for this award, and happy that the
program we left for our new career as full-time grandparents is
flourishing in good hands.<br /> <br /></p>

<h2 id="personal-software">Personal software</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-16, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
Personal software
</h1>
<p>
A few days ago, I was wondering about people writing the software for
their personal site – a blog or a wiki or a digital garden or a
Zettelkasten – running software the authors wrote themselves or got from
a friend. As it turns out, a few people sent me their links and so I’ve
started a collection called
<a href="https://transjovian.org/view/web-sites/index">The text and the
code go hand in hand</a>.
</p>
<p>
The following is a copy of the intro to the collection.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes I hear of “opinionated” software. That is, software which has
a strong vision of how to do a thing. If you like it, use it. If you
don’t, then don’t. But what happens if the software turns out to be
something the author of a site wrote for themselves? It’s more than
opinionated. It’s personal.
</p>
<p>
This website presents a number of sites and the tools they use to create
and update them.
</p>
<p>
If you’re wondering why the list is small, the explanation is that
personal tools are not tidied up and yet we live in a world of software
that is written for being shared. In the corporate context, team
members, reviewers and successors need to understand the code. In the
private world, public code is polished in order to reflect well on
programmers and their abilities.
</p>
<p>
But <em>night software</em> is not like that. It’s not written for the
day job. It’s not written to see the light of day at all. It’s not
written to be looked at and scrutinized by anybody. It’s intimate and
personal, it’s messy and buggy. To take a look is to transgress.
</p>
<p>
And yet, this software offers the unique chance of being the kernel of
convivial software: a tool that we can not only learn how to use but
that we can disassemble and reassemble. We can imagine little computer
clubs discussing our tools, showing how we added this feature or that
feature. It is possible because the tools are small.
</p>
<p>
So if you’re thinking “that stuff is all a huge tangled mess” and “the
code generating my website is not for the public…” – then rest assured.
This is exactly what I’m trying to show. I remember my first system
being a collection of GNU M4 macros and a Makefile and I’d publish it in
a heartbeat, if I still had it. That’s how I wrote my GeoCities pages.
</p>
<p>
I’d love to show the world the unpolished, “just good enough with a
number of bugs I know of” solutions. Let me know if you have one.

From wood gas to plastic waste
</h2>
<p>
During the Second World War,
<a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2010/01/wood-gas-vehicles-firewood-in-the-fuel-tank/">many
motorized vehicles in continental Europe were converted to drive on
firewood</a>.
<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
That happened as a consequence of the rationing of fossil fuels. Wood
gas vehicles were a not-so-elegant alternative to their petrol cousins,
but their range was comparable to today’s electric vehicles. In Germany
alone, around 500,000 wood gas cars, buses, and trucks operated by the
end of WWII. An even more cumbersome alternative was the
<a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2011/11/gas-bag-vehicles/">gas
bag vehicle</a>.
<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Nowadays, there’s much less firewood available than in the 1940s,
especially in industrialized regions. So, what would be the solution to
the disruption of gasoline or electricity in the Third World War? Dutch
artist <a href="https://gijsschalkx.nl">Gijs Schalkx</a> found another
fuel supply, which is abundant: plastic waste. The production of
plastics only started in the 1950s, after the Second World War. Since
then, plastic has become an increasingly popular material, growing to a
global annual production of 460 million metric tons in 2019 – twice as
much as in 2000 and eight times as much as in 1976.
<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>

</div>
<p>
Plastics are made from fossil fuels, and the process can be turned
around. Gijs Schalkx converted an abandoned Volvo 240 to run on diesel
that he makes from the plastic waste he collects. The “de-refinery”
converts plastic waste back into fuel and is installed on the luggage
carrier of the car, making the vehicle independent of the fossil fuel
infrastructure. The plastic waste is heated in a boiler to about 700
degrees Celsius, after which it evaporates. The gas is then cooled down,
and turns into a diesel-like liquid one hour later. Gijs collects it in
plastic bottles – themselves the raw material for the diesel they
contain. The fuel looks like Coca-Cola – one of the largest producers of
plastic waste.
</p>
<h2 id="how-far-can-we-drive-on-plastic-waste">
How far can we drive on plastic waste?
</h2>
<p>
Making fuel can happen while the car drives, but Gijs has kept the two
activities separate for safety reasons. At a speed of 80 km/u, his Volvo
240 drives a distance of 7 kilometres per kilogram of plastic (which
corresponds to 14 kg of plastic per 100 km driven). That includes the
fuel used to heat up the plastic waste on the roof (1 kg of plastic
gives 0.5 liter of diesel). Plastic waste is a rather voluminous
material, and it takes several garbage bags full of plastic waste to
make one liter of fuel. Schalkx plans to use a small shredder to reduce
the volume of the plastic waste he collects, but for now he relies on a
supply of discarded plastic granulate from a neighbour, consisting of
PET and HDPE.

<p>
How far could we drive if we would convert all plastic waste into fuel?
The Netherlands produced roughly 1,650 kiloton of plastic waste in 2017
(1,650,000,000 kg), enough to drive 11.55 billion km (11,550,000,000
km).
<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>
That corresponds to about 1/10th of kilometers driven by all passenger
cars in the Netherlands in 2021 (114.3 billion km).
<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>
On a smaller scale, the average passenger vehicle in the Netherlands
drives 12,000 km per year, requiring each driver and their passengers to
collect 1,714 kg of plastic. On the other hand, even the current amount
of plastic waste per capita in the Netherlands (97 kg) would be enough
to drive 679 km – perhaps sufficient for those who use their automobile
wisely. The amount of plastic waste grows faster than the number of cars
so that we could drive increasingly longer distances in the future.
<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>
</p>
<h2 id="how-sustainable-is-driving-on-plastic-waste">
How sustainable is driving on plastic waste?
</h2>
<p>
Being able to drive a vehicle on plastic waste has benefits in terms of
resilience. For example, it could allow medics to operate ambulances
without a regular fuel supply in a war zone. However, how does a vehicle
driven on plastic waste performs in times of peace? After all, plastic
waste is a huge problem, and Gijs Schalkx’s car gets rid of it. With
less than 10% of plastic waste recycled worldwide, would it make sense
to encourage people to convert their vehicles to run on diesel oil made
of plastic waste? Sure, it would be a more affordable alternative to
electric cars, but what about the carbon emissions?
</p>
<p>
On the one hand, the embodied carbon emissions of the Volvo 240 are
almost zero: Gijs found most components – including the car itself – in
the dump, others on the second-hand market.
<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>
In contrast, manufacturing new vehicles – especially electric ones –
adds a significant carbon footprint before they drive their first
kilometer. They also need an extensive infrastructure to produce and
distribute fuel and electricity, adding more carbon emissions. In
contrast, the Volvo has its fuel infrastructure on the roof, built from
scrap.

<p>
On the other hand, the CO2-emissions from the fuel production and the
fuel combustion are not praiseworthy. First, there is the burning of
plastic on the roof of the car. Making 1 liter of diesel requires the
burning of 1 kg of plastic, which results in 2-2.7 kg carbon emissions.
<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>
Second, there is the combustion of the diesel fuel while driving, which
emits 2.7 kg of carbon dioxide per liter.
<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>
Together, that becomes 4.7 to 5.4 kg CO2 per liter. Consequently, with a
14:1 fuel economy, the Volvo emits 65.8 to 75.6 kg of greenhouse gases
per 100 km.
</p>
<p>
In contrast, the emissions of the average fossil fuel powered car in
Europe amount to 25.8 kg/100 km, including crude oil production, fuel
refining and vehicle manufacturing.
<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>
The emissions of a small electric car like the Nissan Leaf amount to
10.9 kg/100km in Europe, including the emissions of the fuel that is
burned to produce the electricity.
<sup id="fnref1:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>
The Volvo thus emits 2.5 times more CO2 than the average fossil fuel
powered car in Europe, and 7 times more than a small electric car. The
difference will be somewhat smaller, because the data for the other cars
do not include the emissions for building the oil and power
infrastructure. However, this is unlikely to tip the balance.
</p>
<p>
There are several reasons for the high carbon emissions. First, fuel
production by burning plastic on the roof is four times more carbon
intensive than producing fuel from crude oil in a refinery.
<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>
Second, the Volvo dates from 1980, when cars had lower fuel economy.
Gijs Schalkx: “Hypothetically, you could convert a newer car to drive on
plastic waste and have much lower carbon emissions. Likewise, the
de-refinery is one of the first of its kind and could be made more
efficient by real engineers. Oil refineries have been developped for
more than 100 years. However, newer cars have proprietary electronic
motor controls that prevent using alternative fuels.”
</p>
<h2 id="externalizing-pollution">
Externalizing pollution
</h2>
<p>
Carbon emissions are not the only worry. Because of the chemicals added
to plastic, burning it to make fuel creates a lot of nasty air
pollution. Nobody in their right mind will propose a switch to cars
fuelled by plastic waste. However, it is instructive to examine the
motives behind this unanimous conclusion. Much of the plastic waste that
the Volvo 240 burns burns anyways. Not in cars but incinerators. That is
the case for 44% of plastic waste in Europe.
<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>
That plastic waste burns to produce electricity, which can then charge
electric cars. How is that more sustainable than burning plastic on the
roof of your car?
</p>
<div class="article-img vertical">
<figure data-imgstate="dither">
<img src="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2023/11/plastic-waste-in-the-fuel-tank/images/dithers/derefinery-gijs-schalkx-portrait_dithered.png" alt='Image: Burning plastic. Image credit: Gijs Schalkx.' loading="lazy"/>
</figure>
<figcaption class="caption">

</div>
</div>
<p>
The carbon emissions are the same. So is the air pollution, although
it’s easier to put a flue gas scrubber on thousands of incinerators than
on millions of cars. The main difference is that burning plastic waste
in incinerators to power electric cars allows many of us to
<em>externalize</em> the side effects of car driving. An incinerator can
be (and always is) located in a poor neighbourhood, where it causes high
incidences of cancer and other health problems in spite of air pollution
control. Meanwhile, it produces electricity that charges electric cars
which drive around low emission zones in well-to-do neighbourhoods.
</p>
<h2 id="internalizing-pollution">
Internalizing pollution
</h2>
<p>
In contrast, Schalkx’s Volvo <em>internalizes</em> all the side effects
of driving automobiles. The car is not a pleasure to drive, at least not
regularly. It is dirty. Its interior stinks of plastic, which cannot be
healthy – Gijs keeps the car windows open no matter the weather.
Furthermore, he needs to spend a lot of time collecting plastic and
making fuel, and all these disadvantages make him think twice before he
gets behind the wheel. It’s unlikely that Schalkx will drive 12,000 km
per year, and so, ultimately, he will produce less pollution than the
drivers of more sustainable-looking cars that face none of these
problems.
</p>
<p>
Somehow, the Dutch authorities, who are not known for their
permissivity, officially approved the car after inspection. Schalkx
drives tax-free and – thanks to his car being an oldtimer – can enter
low-emission zones, where he parks alongside the latest electric SUV.
Justice is not yet out of this world.

to only 4% in 2012. By 2050, the share of the plastics industry is
forecasted to be 20% of oil production. Sources:

The company has now given itself more time to figure out how to charge
by extending free service through November 2025.

This is
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/11/hackers-can-steal-ssh-cryptographic-keys-in-new-cutting-edge-attack/">interesting</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
For the first time, researchers have demonstrated that a large portion
of cryptographic keys used to protect data in computer-to-server SSH
traffic are vulnerable to complete compromise when naturally occurring
computational errors occur while the connection is being established.
</p>
<p>
[…]
</p>
<p>
The vulnerability occurs when there are errors during the signature
generation that takes place when a client and server are establishing a
connection. It affects only keys using the RSA cryptographic algorithm,
which the researchers found in roughly a third of the SSH signatures
they examined. That translates to roughly 1 billion signatures out of
the 3.2 billion signatures examined. Of the roughly 1 billion RSA
signatures, about one in a million exposed the private key of the host…

Comparison: you see a lightweight sports motorcycle. It’s green. You buy
a Harley and paint it green and say "look mine is a lightweight sports
bike now!"
</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">
Devuan is just Debian with systemd removed and openrc or sysvinit in its
place. This is not a big sweeping change. It’s equivalent to looking at
the sports bike, seeing it has Bridgestone tyres instead of Dunlop, and
swapping the tyres on the Harley to Bridgestone tyres.
</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">
It is a trivial change compared to a libc change. It’s routine
maintenance to change your tyres. You need to do it regularly anyway. It
doesn’t need the bike to be rebuilt.
</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">
It’s not <em class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE">easy</em>. It takes hours
and skills and tools and so on but it’s not sweeping.
</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">
Devuan has rebuilt a tonne of packages to remove dependencies on systemd
and that’s not trivial but it’s still Debian. By and large you can
download any Debian package and install it and it’ll just work because
most things never interact with the init daemon and it won’t make a big
difference.
</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">
A Swiss Army knife with a different axle that pivots a bit more smoothly
and with less force is still a Swiss Army knife and only a knife expert
will be able to even tell the difference.
</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">
It doesn’t make it into a super-slim lightweight knife, like – I know
nothing about knives – something

<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">
You could disassemble a Victorinox and rebuild it into something like
that but it’s really hard and an amateur will end up with a broken pile
of bits.
</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">
So the fact that people build lightweight distros out of Debian doesn’t
mean Debian is lightweight or that you can do it yourself. Think about
it: if it was easy, lightweight remixes wouldn’t exist! There’d be no
point.
</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">
How do you tell if it’s lightweight or not?
</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">
Look at how big the ISO file you download is.

<h2 id="my-gravestone-visualized">My gravestone visualized</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-15, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I love that ChatGPT makes it possible to create visualizations for ideas
that previously I could only present in words.
</p>
<p>
For example, I like to say that when I die my gravestone should say
<i>He’s Done Digging</i> or something like that, to stand in contrast to
my long-lived motto –
<a href="http://scripting.com/2023/07/03/150022.html">Still diggin!</a>
I did some writing this morning about
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+Future-Safe+Archives">Future-Safe
Archives</a>, and thought to get that as a picture. The piece isn’t
ready to publish yet, but no reason not to share the illustration. So
here it is..

Uncle Davy, no longer diggin.

</p>
<p>
PS: No need for an actual gravestone. Online is fine. Hopefully we’ll
figure out how to make such things persist before it’s needed. <span

id="til-that-some-people-cant-remember-the-difference-between-the-386-486">TIL
that some people can’t remember the difference between the 386 &amp;
486</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-15, from: Liam on Linux</p>
I suppose it was a long time
ago.<br /><br />So…<br /><br /><span class="commtext c00">
<p>
The 80386DX was the first x86 CPU to be 32-bit and have an on-chip MMU.
And nothing else: no cache, no FPU.
</p>
<p>
The FPU was a discrete part, the 80387DX.
</p>
<p>
Because OS/2 1.x didn’t support the 80386, and so couldn’t run DOS apps
well, and so flopped, the 16-bit 80286 kept selling well. It ran DOS
fast and it could run Windows 2/286 and Windows 3 in Standard Mode which
was good enough. It could only address 16MB of RAM but that was
fantastically expensive <i>and</i> it was more than enough for DOS and
Windows 3.
</p>
<p>
So, because DOS still ruled, Intel made a cost-reduced version of the
80386DX, the 80386SX. This had a 16-bit data bus, so it could use
cheaper 16-bit motherboards and 16-bit wide RAM, still limited to a max
of 16MB. Still enough.
</p>
<p>
That needed a maths copro for hardware floating point, too: a different
part, the 80387SX.
</p>
<p>
Then Windows 3 came along, which was also good enough, and started a
move in PC apps to GUIs. Windows 3.1 (1992) was better still.
</p>
<p>
So Intel had a 2nd go at the 32-bit chip market with the 80486, marketed
as the "486". This integrated a better 386DX-compatible CPU core with a
few extra instructions, complete with MMU, <i>plus</i> a 387-style FPU,
plus a small amount of L1 cache, all onto one die.
</p>
<p>
But it was expensive, and didn’t sell well.
</p>
<p>
Also, all the 3rd party x86 makers leapt on the bandwagon and integrated
the extra instructions into 16-bit bus 386SX compatible chips and
branded them as 486s: the Cyrix and IBM "486slc" for instance. This ate
into sales of the real 486.
</p>
<p>
So Intel came up with an ethically very dodgy borderline scam: it
shipped 486s with the FPU disabled, calling them the "486DX" to reuse
the branding that distinguished the 32-bit-bus models of 386 from the
16-bit-bus.
</p>
<p>
People don’t understand stuff like bus widths or part numbers, as your
post demonstrates, and I mean no offense. They don’t.
</p>
<p>
So now there was a new model of 486, the 486SX with a disabled FPU, and
the 486DX with it still turned on.
</p>
<p>
The "SX" model needed a new motherboard with a 2nd CPU socket that
accepted a "floating point co-processor", called the "487", which was
nothing of the kind. The "SX" was a lie and so was the "487 copro". The
487 was a 2nd complete 486 chip that disabled the original and took
over.
</p>
<p>
But it reused the older branding, which is what you’ve remembered.
</p>
<p>
Later, briefly, Intel made a cheaper cost-reduced 486SX with a smaller
die with no FPU present, but not many of them. The clock-doubled 486DX2
took over quite quickly and killed the 486DX <i>and</i> 486SX market.
</p>
<p>
Some commentators speculated that the 486DX vs 486SX marketing thing
allowed Intel to sell defective 486s in which the FPU didn’t work but if
it did that was a tiny tiny number: a rounding error.

<p>date: 2023-11-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>With this release, .NET reshapes the way we build intelligent,
cloud-native applications and high-traffic services that scale on
demand. Whether you’re deploying to Linux or Windows, using containers
or a cloud app model of your choice, .NET 8 makes building these apps
easier. It includes a set of proven libraries that are used today by the
many high-scale services at Microsoft to help you with fundamental
challenges around observability, resiliency, scalability, manageability,
and more. Integrate large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI’s GPT
directly into your .NET app. Use a single powerful component model to
handle all your web UI needs with Blazor. Deploy your mobile
applications to the latest version of iOS and Android with .NET MAUI.
Discover new language enhancements that make your code more concise and
expressive with C# 12. It’s still wild to me to that Microsoft provides
detailed installation instructions for .NET for a variety of Linux
distributions, down to stuff like Alpine.</p>

id="google-play-tightens-up-rules-for-android-app-developers-to-require-testing-increased-app-review">Google
Play tightens up rules for Android app developers to require testing,
increased app review</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>Google today is announcing strengthened protections for Android
developers publishing apps to its Google Play store. The changes are a
part of Google’s broader efforts at keeping low-quality and unsafe apps
out of its app store and off consumers’ devices, which also recently
included the launch of a new real-time app scanning feature to combat
malicious apps. Today, the company says it will now require new Android
developers with personal accounts to test their app with a minimum of 20
people for at least 2 weeks prior to publication. It additionally plans
to increase its investment in the app review processes, warning of
potential slowdowns in approvals for a small number of apps as these
changes roll out. At first glance, this sounds like a good idea – more
testing leads to better applications, is the reasoning – but it’s going
to be a massive burden for many small indie developers to even find 20
testers. In my experience, it’s usually the small indie teams or
individual developers that make the best applications on Android, while
the large, well-known brands release steady streams of garbage. In other
words, this is going to disproportionately affect the wrong people.</p>

<p>
Years ago I wanted to do a deep dive on Japanese aesthetics and I needed
a list of good books to read on the subject. Rather than googling for
books, I sent an email to a fellow human being and asked for
recommendations.
</p>
<p>
I had to wait a few days but what I got in return was something that I
could have never google myself and more importantly a new human
connection was born, one I still treasure today.
</p>
<p>
It’s 2023 and I could probably ask the same question to some
AI-chat-thingy and it would probably spit out a very comprehensive list
of books—that may or may not exist—in 20 seconds. That’s fine but it’s
also a conversation ender.

How to add an index to your PDF

<blockquote>
<p>
I mean, it’s great if you want to write a bunch of Perl scripts. But
really… do you? Or indeed: Would you rather like to learn Perl or LaTeX?
🥶 ❓ 🤷‍♂️ ❓ 🥵
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I like my Markdown → HTML + CSS → PDF pipeline. For new PDFs of mine, I
try to use this setup rather than relying on LaTeX. It’s true, LaTeX
documents probably look better in the end. But I don’t write enough
LaTeX at the end of the day. Everything is always tricky to find.
Packages are hard to pick. I always end up on some StackExchange site
and nothing is ever simple.
</p>
<p>
Now, the Markdown → HTML + CSS → PDF pipeline isn’t simple, either. But
it uses HTML and CSS and I use those two more often. I can look at the
temporary HTML file using my browser. When I have questions, I end up on
the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) and it’s not too bad. It’s the kind
of bad that I’m used to.
</p>
<p>
I’m not sure I’m doing a great job selling this. Remember how many years
ago I tried to be objective about it all and concluded that using Libre
Office would be the most efficient tool. You can go back and read the
<a href="2010-06-30_LaTeX_vs._Docbook">blog post from 2010</a>. But I
guess I got burned back in the last millenium when Word 5.1 was new and
liked to crash, and Open Office was not great either, and Abi Word was
too limited.
</p>
<p>
I learned to love Emacs and LaTeX and I don’t want to go back to those
graphical user interfaces. Somehow they make it hard to use styles
correctly and consistenly. So text-based it is!
</p>
<p>
What follows is a short summary of how the Markdown → HTML + CSS → PDF
pipeline works.
</p>
<p>
There are a number of things you need:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
a bunch of Markdown files, which you write using your favourite text
editor
</li>
<li>
a program to turn Markdown into HTML; I use Python with the Markdown
module but any other command line tool would do
</li>
<li>
a CSS file to format the HTML generated
</li>
<li>
a program to turn HTML and CSS into PDF; the one I use is called
<code>weasyprint</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Weasyprint is also written in Python, which shouldn’t matter too much –
except that I have Debian installed and the weasyprint it comes with
doesn’t know how to hyphenate my text, which is bad news when you’re
writing a German text with long words. And what German text doesn’t have
long words? We love smashing words together!
</p>
<p>
This leads me to an immediate problem that LaTeX solves but that
weasyprint does not: In German, you can’t have ligatures connecting
parts of a word that are themselves smashed-together words. For example,
the word Auffahrt (up-drive, also known as Ascension Day) consists of
the prefix “auf” and the word “fahrt” so you can’t use the ﬀ ligature.
There’s a LaTeX package for that,
<a href="https://github.com/micoloretan/selnolig/">selnolig</a>.
</p>
<p>
A while ago I wrote a Perl script that takes this file and does the
right thing for HTML: it inserts ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER characters in all
those places. This Perl script is called
<a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/keine-ligaturen.git">keine-ligaturen</a>,
no ligatures.
</p>
<p>
So I need that.
</p>
<p>
Now, the Python’s Markdown module doesn’t generate a stand-alone HTML
file. I need to provide my own prefix and suffix.
</p>
<p>
<code>prefix</code> is where I define the language to use for
hyphenation and the CSS file to use for the formatting.
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html lang=de&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;link type=&quot;text/css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;Horte.css&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
<code>suffix</code> is the file where I close the <code>html</code> and
<code>body</code> tags I opened in the <code>prefix</code> file.
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
I tie all of this together in my <code>Makefile</code>. Here’s how it
might work.
</p>
<pre><code>SHELL=/bin/bash
KAPITEL=$(sort $(wildcard [0-9A-F]-*.md))

all: Horte.pdf

%.pdf: %.html %.css
    weasyprint $&lt; $@

%.html: %.html.tmp prefix suffix append-index
    cat prefix $&lt; suffix | perl append-index &gt; $@

%.html.tmp: %.md
    python3 -m markdown \n
        --extension=markdown.extensions.attr_list \
        --extension=markdown.extensions.tables \
        --extension markdown.extensions.smarty \
        $&lt; \
    | keine-ligaturen &gt; $@

Horte.md: Titelblatt.md Lizenz.md $(KAPITEL)
    date '+&lt;p class=&quot;timestamp&quot;&gt;%F&lt;/p&gt;' &gt; timestamp
    cat Titelblatt.md timestamp $(KAPITEL) Lizenz.md &gt; $@

clean:
    rm -f Horte.md Horte.html Horte.html.tmp \
          Horte.pdf
</code></pre>
<p>
So this is what happens:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
all the Markdown files are concatenated into <code>Horte.md</code> (and
a timestamp is added after the titlepage)
</li>
<li>
the Markdown file is turned into a temporary HTML file called
<code>Horte.html.tmp</code> using the Python Markdown module and the
German ligature breaks are added by the <code>keine-ligaturen</code>
Perl script
</li>
<li>
the temporary HTML file is concatenated with the <code>prefix</code> and
<code>sufix</code> files to form the real HTML file, called
<code>Horte.html</code> and here yet another Perl script is used:
<code>append-index</code> (more about that below)
</li>
<li>
finally, the HTML file is turned into PDF using <code>weasyprint</code>
resulting in <code>Horte.pdf</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Now we’re finally getting to the script I wanted to talk about this
entire time. What’s the role of <code>append-index</code>? It parses the
HTML file and determines which terms should be in the index using XPath.
And then it adds an index at the end.
</p>
<p>
There are two parts to the script. In the first part, the terms to index
are collected.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
the HMTL is parsed and an XPath expression is used to search for strings
to index (in this case: H3 headings and bold text in blockquotes if they
have the <code>ref</code> class)
</li>
<li>
if the term has no <code>id</code>, an <code>id</code> is computed based
on the term to index; a number is appended if the <code>id</code>
computed turns out to be a duplicate
</li>
<li>
every term is associated with a list of ids (in case a term appears
multiple times)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
In the second part, the HTML for the Index page is assembled. Every term
is printed, followed by a link for every <code>id</code> recorded above.
The text of the link is a ZERO WIDTH SPACE so that it doesn’t look weird
in the PDF. The actual page number to use is still unknown at this point
because only the PDF generator knows about the pages! See below for
more.
</p>
<pre><code>use Modern::Perl '2018';
use XML::LibXML;

undef $/;
my $doc = XML::LibXML-&gt;load_html(string =&gt; &lt;STDIN&gt;);

my @nodes = $doc-&gt;findnodes('//h3 | //blockquote/p/strong[@class=&quot;ref&quot;]'),

    $an-&gt;setAttribute('href', '#' . $id);

    $p-&gt;appendChild($an);
  }
  $div-&gt;appendTextNode(&quot;\n&quot;);
}

print $doc;
</code></pre>
<p>
Here is some example Markdown illustrating the functionality:
</p>
<pre><code>Elfen verwenden gerne grosse [Raubkatzen](#katze) zum Schutz ihrer Lager.

&gt; **Pumas**{: .ref ref=&quot;Puma&quot;} (1W6-3) TW 3 RK 14 1W6 RW +1 BW 24 ML 7
&gt; EP 300

### Raubkatzen {: #katze}

&gt; **Puma**{: .ref} TW 3 RK 14 1W6 RW +1 BW 24 ML 7 EP 300
</code></pre>
<p>
The XPath expression find the following terms:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
“Pumas” because of <code>class="ref"</code> and determines that the term
to use is “Puma” (singular) because of <code>ref="Puma"</code>
</li>
<li>
“Raubkatzen” because it’s a H3 heading
</li>
<li>
“Puma” because of <code>class="ref"</code> and this time the term is the
text content
</li>
</ul>
<p>
HTML generated for the Index:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div id=&quot;index&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Index&lt;/h2&gt;
…
&lt;p&gt;Puma&lt;a class=&quot;ref&quot; href=&quot;#puma&quot;&gt;​&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;ref&quot; href=&quot;#puma2&quot;&gt;​&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raubkatzen&lt;a class=&quot;ref&quot; href=&quot;#katze&quot;&gt;​&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
…
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
The magic for page numbers is in the CSS, namely in the last rule where
it says that the content of index links is a space and
<code>target-counter(attr(href), page)</code>.
</p>
<pre><code>/* index */
#index {
    columns: 3;
    column-gap: 2ex;
    font-size: 11pt;
    line-height: 13pt;
    text-align: left;
}
#index h2 {
    column-span: all;
}
#index p {
    margin: 0;
    padding-left: 1em;
    text-indent: -1em;
}
#index a {
    color: inherit;
    text-decoration: none;
}
#index a::after {
    content: ' ' target-counter(attr(href), page);
}

<h2 id="alamedas-on-ramp">Alameda’s On-Ramp</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-14, from: David Rosenthal’s blog</p>
Tether has been one of the major mysteries of the cryptosphere for a
long time. It has never been audited, and has been described as being
“<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-10-07/crypto-mystery-where-s-the-69-billion-backing-the-stablecoin-tether">practically
quilted out of red flags</a>”. Matt Levine
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-10-31/bad-passwords-are-securities-fraud">says</a>
“I feel like eventually Tether is going to be an incredibly interesting
story, but I still don’t know what it is.” He was commenting on Emily
Nicolle’s
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-30/bankman-fried-trial-renews-speculation-about-alameda-s-tether-usdt-pile"><i>Bankman-Fried
Trial Renews Conjecture About Alameda’s $40 Billion Tether Stablecoin
Pile</i></a> by Emily Nicolle. It includes a lot of interesting
information, starting with this:<br />
<blockquote>
Alameda was Tether’s largest non-exchange customer between 2020 and
2022, with blockchain data showing it received almost $40 billion in
transfers of its stablecoin USDT directly from the company — equal to
roughly 20% of all USDT tokens ever issued.<br />
</blockquote>
Below the fold, I discuss the questions Nicolle raises, and go on to ask
one she doesn’t<br /> <span><a name='more'></a></span> <br /> The
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-30/bankman-fried-trial-renews-speculation-about-alameda-s-tether-usdt-pile">obvious
question is</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The vast amount has raised questions about where Alameda got the money
to fund the issuance of the stablecoin, which is typically used as a
dollar proxy and is the world’s most traded cryptocurrency. That even
led to speculation Alameda might have used other means to help fund the
purchases, similar to its bets on startups or dealings with lenders.
</blockquote>
By “other means” Nicolle means using FTX’s FTT token. But, if you can
believe Tether, that
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-30/bankman-fried-trial-renews-speculation-about-alameda-s-tether-usdt-pile">isn’t
what happened</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Tether’s incoming chief executive Paolo Ardoino appeared to clear up the
mystery in a social media
<a href="https://x.com/paoloardoino/status/1715083160109683181?s=20">post</a>
this month, reiterating an earlier statement that the hedge fund wired
dollars to Tether in exchange for the cryptocurrency.
</blockquote>
An important part of the story is that most people and institutions
can’t buy USDT from, or sell USDT to, Tether directly. They have to go
via one of the small number of institutions that are Tether customers.
And those customers can only buy or sell in large amounts. Alameda was
one of these customers. Nicolle quotes
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-30/bankman-fried-trial-renews-speculation-about-alameda-s-tether-usdt-pile">Jonathan
Reiter</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
“This was one major on-ramp, maybe the major on-ramp” for traders
seeking access to USDT, said Jonathan Reiter, CEO of blockchain
analytics firm ChainArgos. “It is certainly peculiar that FTX, which is
now alleged to have run an essentially fraudulent exchange, still
somehow managed to intermediate tens of billions in one-way flow from
USD into USDT.”
</blockquote>
My oversimplified mental model of stablecoins like USDT is that they are
the chips in the casino. If you want to play the tables, you need to
hand dollars to the cashier and get chips in return, because the tables
only accept chips. The cashiers in the cryptocurrency casino need
accounts at banks, so they can receive dollars or other fiat, and
accounts at Tether, so they can receive USDT. Since the early days of
Tether, it has been increasingly difficult for cryptocurrency traders
and exchanges to maintain accounts at banks. For example, in this
interview of
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKeMfxLV8K8">Charles Yang by
John Riggins</a>, Yang (head trader of Genesis Block based in Hong Kong)
says:<br />
<blockquote>
bank acccounts are the absolute most valuable thing — you have to set up
a bunch of different companies, a lot of different bank accounts just to
facilitate trades that aren’t that big, maybe $50K. The moment you tell
them this is for a USDT trade, you’re basically asking them to shut your
bank account down.
</blockquote>
Alameda, run by ex-Wall Street whiz-kid US citizens, had the savvy and
credentials to have bank accounts through which
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-30/bankman-fried-trial-renews-speculation-about-alameda-s-tether-usdt-pile">billions
of dollars could be moved</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Alameda received around $39.6 billion in USDT tokens from Tether’s
treasury wallet, according to on-chain data tracking its wallets, as
labeled by the Arkham Intelligence platform.<br /> <br /> Meanwhile
wallets connected to FTX sent $3.9 billion in USDT tokens back to
Tether, all during the crash of TerraUSD and Luna in May 2022 — meaning
that Alameda largely transferred the tokens it received to other
entities, rather than cashing it out for dollars with Tether directly.
It’s worth noting that this may not record all of FTX or Alameda’s
redeemed tokens due to the way Tether swaps its coins between different
blockchains, according to Coinbase’s Conor Grogan, who updated Alameda’s
USDT total after most of its transactions were
<a href="https://protos.com/tether-papers-crypto-stablecoin-usdt-investigation-analysis/">first
reported</a> by Protos in 2021.
</blockquote>
Presumably, Alameda received dollars via their accounts at US banks such
as the late lamented Signature and Silvergate, aggregated them into
orders big enough for Tether,
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-30/bankman-fried-trial-renews-speculation-about-alameda-s-tether-usdt-pile">then</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
To mint or redeem USDT, FTX would transfer funds via its own accounts at
Tether’s Bahamas-based bank Deltec Bank or a US-based correspondent
bank, Bankman-Fried said in a series of social media posts in 2021. A
popular solution utilized by Tether and other crypto firms were banking
networks established by Signature Bank and Silvergate Bank, both of
which collapsed earlier this year.
</blockquote>
The mismatch between the minting and redeeming is why Reiter talks about
a “one-way flow from USD into USDT”. It seems clear that Alameda was
exploiting its access to both the banking system and Tether to
facilitate this flow. How big a player were they
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-30/bankman-fried-trial-renews-speculation-about-alameda-s-tether-usdt-pile">in
this flow?</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
A rough estimate using transactional data for USDT’s main two networks —
Ethereum and Tron, which support about 98% of USDT’s current circulation
— shows Tether has issued about $190 billion in USDT between its
inception and Oct. 20, according to analysis by ChainArgos.<br /> <br />
Conversely, Tether has redeemed about $108 billion in its lifetime. The
difference is about $82 billion, compared with around $84 billion in
circulation. The discrepancy can be attributed to the amount of USDT
trading on other blockchains, according to ChainArgos.
</blockquote>
Alameda bought $40B of USDT out of a total mint of $190B and sold $4B
out of total burn of $108B. They were ~21% of the on-ramp but only 4% of
the off-ramp.<br /> <br /> Nicolle again
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-30/bankman-fried-trial-renews-speculation-about-alameda-s-tether-usdt-pile">quotes
Reiter</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
“This does not really look like a market-maker or trading firm as those
terms are normally used. It looks more like a money changer,” said
Reiter.<br /> <br /> Inflows and outflows from Alameda’s main wallet
each month were almost equal, Reiter said, indicating that the main
purpose for the mints was most likely to facilitate USDT purchases on
behalf of FTX and its customers. This is supported by Bankman-Fried’s
statements that FTX would transfer funds via bank accounts to Tether, in
addition to evidence submitted to his trial which alleged that FTX often
relied on Alameda’s bank accounts for exchange purposes.<br /> <br />
“These guys were running a one-way USD to USDT bureau de change,” said
Reiter, adding that any USDT that Alameda actually held on to was never
in large size relative to its minting activity.
</blockquote>
This explains how a significant part of the $190B Tether minted was
funded. But it begs the question of where the $104B redeemed went that
didn’t go to Alameda? Who were the Tether customers who made the
redemptions and what did they do with the dollars?<br /> <br />

On the Chain Argos blog, Patrick Tan’s
<a href="https://medium.com/chainargos/a-tale-of-tether-on-tron-before-and-after-the-russian-invasion-of-ukraine-b9d4c63196b4"><i>A
Tale of Tether on TRON Before and After the Russian Invasion of
Ukraine</i></a> suggests one answer. Tan notes that:<br />
<blockquote>
Although most attention is focused on the use of Tether on the Ethereum
blockchain, the reality is the bulk of transactions occur on TRON for a
simple reason — low or zero transaction fees.<br /> …<br /> Using data
from ChainArgos, 50 so-called “whale wallets” for USDT on the TRON
blockchain were analyzed in the weeks leading up to, and following, the
Russian invasion of Ukraine.<br /> <br /> From the chart above, it’s
clear that the 50 biggest wallets that transact in Tether on TRON saw a
larger cluster of activity just before and after the Russian invasion of
Ukraine in February 2022.<br /> <br /> None of the wallets (as far as
has been identified) are wallets belonging to cryptocurrency exchanges.
</blockquote>
<a href="https://medium.com/chainargos/a-tale-of-tether-on-tron-before-and-after-the-russian-invasion-of-ukraine-b9d4c63196b4">But</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
one of those wallet addresses:<br /> <br />
TCTrwC2rxGFRS74XihgdMkp5mLYGezdrDL<br /> <br /> (the “Alameda Wallet”)
also happens to be the wallet used by Alameda Research (yes that one) to
deposit funds into cryptocurrency exchange FTX.com.<br /> <br /> Even as
the trial of FTX.com founder Sam Bankman-Fried proceeds in earnest, the
Alameda Wallet saw a massive $300 mm in Tether flow into it, occurring
just days before the Russian invasion.
</blockquote>
<a href="https://medium.com/chainargos/a-tale-of-tether-on-tron-before-and-after-the-russian-invasion-of-ukraine-b9d4c63196b4">And
then</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Of particular note was this wallet address:<br /> <br />
TYZseM53iSPB75aN1V5N762GgzAjBp7PcX<br /> <br /> which sent a whopping
$194 mm USDT in just two weeks around the time of the invasion.<br />
<br /> And a quick Google search of the address reveals Telegram (the
messaging service) posts by “The Ghost of New Russia” containing this
wallet address that appeared to be raising funds for Russia’s
invasion.<br /> <br /> On further analysis, this wallet, and others with
large USDT transactions in the run-up to the Russian invasion are part
of a massive Russian-Kazakh pyramid scheme that had already been
blacklisted by the Russian central bank in 2022.<br /> <br /> After the
USDT is collected into:<br /> <br />
TYZseM53iSPB75aN1V5N762GgzAjBp7PcX<br /> <br /> it’s then withdrawn into
a collection of wallets, but with two in particularly large sizes:<br />
<ol>
<li>
TXxU8LJ9wwQxUdg1YNP7LPz4YSXB5guhc5
</li>
<li>
TCtVdT6XSoWcQifTHbBzFcuaUDX9oo8Yr5
</li>
</ol>
Then there’s a few withdrawals for less than $2 mm, almost as if someone
is taking their “commission” or “fees” for facilitating the
transactions.<br /> <br /> What happens next is relatively predictable,
from these withdrawal wallets, the USDT was sent to cryptocurrency
exchange Binance, probably for the final cashing out into fiat currency.
</blockquote>
That
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2023/01/binances-time-in-barrel.html">Binance</a>
provided an off-ramp isn’t unexpected. What was unexpected was that the
spike in off-ramping started two weeks before the invasion. The Russians
maintained good enough operational secrecy that Ukraine was suprised and
the troops thought they were on exercise. Knowing two weeks ahead that
Ukraine would be invaded means the off-rampers were very close to Putin.
Tan speculates that the funds were destined for the
<a href="https://medium.com/chainargos/a-tale-of-tether-on-tron-before-and-after-the-russian-invasion-of-ukraine-b9d4c63196b4">Wagner
Group</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
One possible explanation is Russia’s heavy use of the Wagner Group —
mercenaries closely affiliated with the Kremlin, but disavowed when
convenient.<br /> <br /> And as is known, mercenaries, whether at the
Battle of Waterloo or the Donbas, need to be paid, whether in gold, or a
hard currency like the dollar, failing which Tether will do.<br />
<br /> This explanation becomes all the more plausible because the
shadowy Wagner Group has been operating in the Donbas since 2014.<br />
<br /> So if Russia wanted to wage an all-out invasion of Ukraine, and
the Wagner Group needed to recruit mercenaries in a hurry without an
audit trail linked to the Kremlin, what better way than using
stablecoins such as Tether?<br /> <br /> And if a Wagner Group mercenary
wanted to ensure he’d get paid no matter what, which would he prefer,
the ruble against a backdrop of soon-to-be sanctioned Russian banks, or
Tether on TRON?<br />
</blockquote>
It is very plausible that the uptick in USDT activity was related to the
invasion, but I am more skeptical about the far end of the off-ramp
being the Wagner Group. As I understand it, the Russians did not plan an
“all-out invasion of Ukraine”; they expected their armored thrusts and
airborne landings to swiftly capture Kyiv and its government, which
would be replaced by a puppet administration supported by the mass of
the Ukrainian population.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagner_Group#2022_invasion_of_Ukraine">Wikipedia
suggests</a> that Wagner’s initial involvement was limited to two of
three attempts to assassinate Zelenskyy.<br /> <br /> Doubtless,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yevgeny_Prigozhin">Yevgeny
Prigozhin</a> and Wagner’s leadership would have known of the invasion
plans, probably much more than two weeks ahead, and seen it as prudent
to accumulate fiat. But I doubt that this fiat was intended for
recruiting additional mercenaries, which wouldn’t have been needed had
the invasion plans worked out.<br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I agree with
Tan when
<a href="https://medium.com/chainargos/a-tale-of-tether-on-tron-before-and-after-the-russian-invasion-of-ukraine-b9d4c63196b4">he
argues</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
that’s why it’s so important to monitor stablecoin flows — because they
can provide an orthogonal data point that most fund and risk managers
may miss.<br /> <br /> Whether as an indicator of leverage or risk
appetite, or as a precursor to a potentially economically destabilizing
conflict, stablecoin flows are becoming an increasingly important metric
to monitor.

<p>date: 2023-11-14, from: OS News</p>
<p>It’s definitely clear that Huawei is pulling the plug on Android
apps, but it’s still rather hard to believe that the company is throwing
away Android (AOSP) entirely. For that, we’ll just have to wait and see,
as more digging can be done when “Next” hits the scene next year. The
Chinese market is big enough to sustain its own application ecosystem,
and many western services are banned in China anyway, so the Play Store
is of lesser value there. It makes sense for Huawei to not waste time
and resources on maintaining Android application compatibility.</p>

<p>date: 2023-11-14, from: OS News</p>
<p>I tried to launch BattleTech over and over and had zero success. I
couldn’t figure out why it was struggling on my model 80 board, where it
runs just great on 86Box. What is going on? One thing I had stumbled
upon was that if I launched an ancient Infocom game in a DOS box, and
then launched BattleTech it had a much higher chance of running. But
this did not always equate to it working. How is launching an old COM
file from the early 80’s excise the ‘devil’ of some 1988 EXE from
running? As the title suggests, it’s got to do with the math
coprocessor. I know I say this often, but I’m so glad people dive into
these sorts of things decades later to figure out what’s going on. It
makes for great reading.</p>

<h2 id="sanitize-html-and-svg">Sanitize HTML and SVG?</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-14, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
Sanitize HTML and SVG?
</h1>
<p>
Would you do it? Is “writing your own website” an activity that could be
described as “untrusted user generated content”? I get the feeling that
perhaps it is not! It is your site, you are writing the thing, so it’s
trusted. Your visitors need to trust you, too.
</p>
<p>
Now, in order for an attacker to hurt your visitors, they would need to
get access to the file system via the web server somehow.
</p>
<p>
Do you feel that the situation changes when there’s a service like
<a href="oddmu">Oddmu</a> that generates the HTML based on Markdown?
</p>
<p>
I guess the source remains the same, you’re writing the Markdown,
therefore the HTML, and so on. But now the attack surface is larger:
attackers can attack either the web server (the reverse proxy in front)
or the service itself (in the backend). I don’t run the service in a
“demilitarized zone” (DMZ) – what a word! – so there’s that.
</p>
<p>
The reason I’m wondering about all that is because I wonder whether I
need to sanitize the output of the Markdown to HTML conversion using a
library like
<a href="https://github.com/microcosm-cc/bluemonday">bluemonday</a>.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
bluemonday takes untrusted user generated content as an input, and will
return HTML that has been sanitised against an allowlist of approved
HTML elements and attributes so that you can safely include the content
in your web page.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Hm. Even if Oddmu is used by a group of people, I would still assume
that they trust each other. In such a context, there are no “untrusted
users”.
</p>
<p>
So why not take the easy route and just apply sanitization always? The
reason is that I sometimes (rarely!) include SVG in my Markdown, like in
<a href="2022-06-30_How_to_communicate_dungeon_maps_to_players">2022-06-30
How to communicate dungeon maps to players</a>.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday evening and this morning I spent a fair amount of time writing
code that adds SVG validation to a bluemonday policy. You can take a
look in
<a href="https://github.com/microcosm-cc/bluemonday/issues/196">issue
#196</a>. It’s awful. And I suspect that the specs will keep changing
over time and so I will keep running into issues. It would be much
easier to just drop it.

Democracy</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-13, updated: 2023-11-08, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Artificial intelligence will change so many aspects of society, largely
in ways that we cannot conceive of yet. Democracy, and the systems of
governance that surround it, will be no exception. In this short essay,
I want to move beyond the “AI-generated disinformation” trope and
speculate on some of the ways AI will change how democracy functions—in
both large and small ways.
</p>
<p>
When I survey how artificial intelligence might upend different aspects
of modern society, democracy included, I look at four different
dimensions of change: speed, scale, scope, and sophistication. Look for
places where changes in degree result in changes of kind. Those are
where the societal upheavals will happen…

<h2 id="the-apple-network-servers-all-too-secret-weapon-ppc-toolbox">The
Apple Network Server’s all-too-secret weapon: PPC Toolbox</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-13, from: OS News</p>
<p>However, there was a secret weapon hidden in ANS AIX most of us at
the time never knew about. Built-in to the operating system was a fully
Unix-native AppleTalk stack and support for receiving and sending Apple
Events, surfaced in the form of Apple’s disk administration tools and
AppleShare. But Apple had a much more expansive vision for this feature:
full server-client “symbiotic” applications that could do their
number-crunching on the ANS and present the results on a desktop Mac.
Using the Program-to-Program Communication Toolbox (“PPCToolbox”), and
because AIX’s throughput far exceeded anything the classic Mac OS ever
could ever handle, an ANS could augment a whole bunch of Macs at once
that didn’t have to stop to do the work themselves. Well, today we’re
going to write one of those “symbiotic” applications doing something
this little Mystic Color Classic could never efficiently do itself —
accessing and processing a JSON API over TLS 1.3 — and demonstrate not
only how such an client application looked on the Mac side, but also how
the server component worked on the AIX side. If you’re lucky enough to
have an ANS running AIX too, you can even compile and run it yourself.
But before we do that, it might be a little instructive to talk about
how the Apple Network Server came to run AIX in the first place. I had
no idea the ANS could do this. That’s an incredibly cool feature, and
clearly fits in the whole “the network is the computer” idea that
dominated the late ’90s.</p>

<p>date: 2023-11-13, from: OS News</p>
<p>Remember when we linked to David Revoy’s story about how his drawing
pen’s buttons stopped working properly due to a Linux kernel update?
Well, it turns out that Linux kernel developers took this one up, and a
fix is already being tested. This solution is still W.I.P. and I still
have some homework to send more data about my tablets after this blog
post, but in overall I’m already using a newer kernel (Linux workstation
6.5.10-200.fc38.x86_64) and I don’t have the problem with the eraser
mode on the top button of my XPPen Artist 24 Pro and XPPen Artist 16 Pro
Gen2 styluses. The buttons are also now perfectly customisable via
xsetwacom CLI tool. Yay! That’s why I wanted to share this blog-post as
soon as possible. Be sure to read the whole article for an in-depth
explanation of what’s being done to fix this.</p>

Progress on Godot on iPad.

<p>
Making Godot launch a game on the iPad was a lot more work than I
anticipated as you can't run separate processes on iOS. But I got it
working:

Outlook sends passwords, mails and other data to Microsoft</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-12, from: OS News</p>
<p>“Microsoft steals access data” – When the well-known German IT portal
“Heise Online” uses such drastic words in its headline, then something
is up. If Microsoft has its way, all Windows users will have to switch
to the latest version of Microsoft Outlook. But: Not only can the IMAP
and SMTP access data of your e-mail account be transferred to Microsoft,
but all e-mails in the INBOX can also be copied to the Microsoft
servers, even if you have your mailbox with a completely different
provider such as mailbox.org. They’re going to use it for AI, I’m
assuming. In any event, don’t use the new Outlook – it’s a web app
anyway and there’s better clients for Windows. I think. I’m not sure
people are still developing e-mail clients for Windows.</p>

Wayland by default</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-12, from: OS News</p>
<p>Yep you read that right, we’ve decided to throw the lever and go
Wayland by default! The three remaining showstoppers are in the process
of being fixed and we expect them to be done soon–certainly before the
final release of Plasma 6. So we wanted to make the change early to
gather as much feedback as possible. Excellent news. Of course,
distributions will still be able to opt for the unmaintained, deprecated
X.org if they want to, but most distributions will opt for Wayland, as
all the major ones have been doing for a while now.</p>

The FreeDOS Edlin project is the standard line editor in FreeDOS,
replacing the classic edlin program from original DOS. Gregory Pietsch
has released Edlin 2.23, which fixes a compile time warning when
compiling with OpenWatcom C. You can download the source from
<a class="" href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/freedos-edlin/">Edlin
on SourceForge</a>. We’ve also mirrored this version (plus a compiled
16-bit DOS executable, as EDLIN16.EXE) on the FreeDOS Files Archive at

<p>And a round-up of other show dates, whether known or likely! The time
is almost here to say goodbye to 2023 and welcome in a whole new year,
which we should probably call ‘2024’ – and if we’re looking at a new
year, we may as well start thinking about the RISC OS shows that we’ll
be attending, the first of which is usually the Southwest Show.
Organised by R-Comp‘s Andrew Rawnsley and Orpheus Internet‘s Richard
Brown – both also of RISC OS Developments – the show usually takes
place…</p>

<p>The RISC OS User Group of London (ROUGOL) usually holds its meetings
on the third Monday of each month, but it has been pushed back a week
for November – so if you have 20th November marked in your diaries,
scrub it out and add 27th November. With the meeting that far off, it
might seem unusual to see an announcement this early, but there’s a good
reason for that. The topic for the meeting will be repairing and
upgrading Archimedes and RISC OS machines. The group will be
looking…</p>

<p>The great thing about the private Facebook group is I have invited
friends from all stages of my life. People I knew in from high school,
New Orleans, Madison, Palo Alto, Cambridge and Berkeley, NYC and
Woodstock. Even people I knew as a child. People I only or mostly know
virtually. Imho, people who won’t use Facebook miss out. Its greatest
feature are the people who use it. It’s the kind of village we yearn
for, at a DNA level. People you will never stop loving. I don’t think
I’ve ever mentioned this group on the blog, but maybe I should do that
more, because it’s a uniquely civilized, friendly and soul-nourishing
online place, at least for me.</p>

<p>But first I need to be able to interact ChatGPT-style with the
archive I’ve already created. Yesterday I saw
<a href="https://www.kawasakigpt.com/">Guy Kawasaki’s chatbot</a>,

<p>Someday an author is going to construct a universe in a LLM and let
users interact with it. That sounds boring, but here’s the interesting
idea that led to it. Yesterday I asked
<a href="http://scripting.com/2023/11/11/013609.html">ChatGPT to
draw</a> me a image of an ancient band performing in the desert with
cacti as the audience. Then this morning I had the idea of moving the
concert into the pond behind my house, except this time
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/11/12/concertInThePond.png">the
audience are frogs</a>. I have a private Facebook group where I tell the
story of the pond, including the animals who come to visit. Some of them
I invent, they don’t actually exist. And they have relationships with
each other, at least in my mind. A natural thing to make part of this
private group would be the LLM of all the animals, and their stories and
relationships. And other people’s models could incorporate mine. This
was an idea I had for SimCity, and the
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+world+outline">web
of outlines</a>, neither of which happened. Maybe it’ll happen in
LLM-land.</p>
