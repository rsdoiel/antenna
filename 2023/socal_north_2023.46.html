<p>
As life returned to normal after the pandemic, I was excited to return
to movie theaters. All I could think about were the exciting new
stories, the smell of buttery popcorn and the anticipation before the
film as the lights went down. Emerging from quarantine, box office
movies like “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” in 2023, or […]

<p>date: 2023-11-15, from: The Occidental News (Occidental College

<p>
Since the fall of the Qing Dynasty, the Tibetan people have been
fighting for independence from China. My grandfather left Tibet in 1959,
and his children eventually made their way to the US. Although I’m a
member of the Tibetan diaspora, I grew up far from any Tibetan
communities. So in 2019, when my friend suggested I join […]

<p>
There aren’t many artists who can make their fans cause
an earthquake, break Ticketmaster, receive an eight minute standing
ovation or become mayor for a day in Santa Clara. But Taylor Swift has
done it all. I never had a whole Spotify playlist dedicated to Swift’s

My favorite Disney movie as a kid was “Cinderella.” If I said that to
you face to face, you might be a little surprised. The person I’ve grown
into does not look like the kind of person who enjoyed a swooning
romance, a rags-to-riches tale, a story where the girl gets swept off
her feet […]

In an article titled “37 professors sign pro-Palestine email, face
pushback from colleagues,” The Occidental quoted Comparative Studies in
Literature and Culture (CSLC) professor Jacob Mackey as saying that it
is “factually inaccurate and extremely dangerous” to call Israel a
“settler colonial” society. We are unsure what this claim is based on or
why Mackey […]

Occidental athletes follow a rigorous schedule to perform their best.
Often, they push their bodies with training that challenges the
strongest of them. The antidote is rest and recovery. For some, it’s a
simple team breakfast in the MP; for others, it’s listening to music and
stretching. Brandon Kim (first year), a member of the […]
