I'm much better at it this go-around than the last time. Generally I can get it done in three or four moves. If it takes five it's because I made a mistake or took a gamble on the second move that didn't work out. These days I don't even try for the second move, but this morning, on the first move I got four out of the five letters, and got the correct position of two of the four. It took a couple of seconds to see that there was really only one answer, so I decided to risk it, and there was this moment we yearn for when the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbK1SM_Qomg">letters reveal</a> one at a time, all green, a final correct move, in two.

## Conversation vs publishing

date: 2023-12-22, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Conversation has a place, but I think we've explored that pretty well, and now I want to create better publishing and reading systems, that are as fast as social web systems, but place less emphasis on replies that can be seen by everyone, because that often is not really conversation, it's spam. </p>
<p>I think ultimately we'll be disappointed with federation for all the reasons we're frustrated with earlier social web systems. People trying to get attention for their ideas, which often are spam or trolling. I also think this means RSS will be more valuable going forward because it's great at publishing, checking all the <a href="http://textcasting.org/">textcasting</a> boxes. </p>
<p>I plan to build with and around WordPress. I think of WordPress as a basic platform the way I saw Twitter between 2006 and 2022. Now the question is what are the steps to use WordPress as the back-end of a social communication system. Behind the scenes, its database has all the capabilities we need to provide the tools writers need. And it has excellent RSS support. It all runs at scale and has a mature yet simple API.  That is all we need to form a hub.</p>

## WHAT WILL SURVIVE OF US IS LOVE

date: 2023-12-22, from: Howard Jacobson blog

Here, rather than an individual card to each of my subscribers, is the jacket of my new novel to be published by Jonathan Cape on Feb 1, 2024. With it, I wish you all a Happy New Year! I take the title from Philip Larkin&#8217;s poem An Arundel Tomb. That&#8217;s the one in which Larkin notes with &#8216;sharp tender shock&#8217; that the entombed earl has removed his gauntlet and has been holding the countess&#8217;s hand for centuries. The feelings defy the cold stone in which they&#8217;re expressed. It's an elegant poem, similarly defying its own rigidity. If you can read it and not weep a stony tear you have never held a lover&#8217;s hand. I can&#8217;t go for long without a hand in my mine. I&#8217;ve always been a love poet masquerading as a Rabelaisian novelist, it&#8217;s just that no one has noticed. In my new novel &#8211; as the title suggests - I celebrate love from its first ecstatic minute to its final devotional hour and make fewer jokes than in earlier work.

<p>I was fortunate to study art and design at <a href="https://risd.edu">RISD.edu</a>. While majoring in Film/Animation/Video, I became interested in motion graphics, which began a winding path toward interaction design.</p>
<p>Though I've been happily settled in Durham, NC for over a decade now – the longest I've lived in one spot! – I've lived in many places; the most distant was Penang, Malaysia.</p>
<p>I was recently asked to choose three adjectives to describe myself. The first that came to mind was "curious." I have more interests than I have time to pursue them. Many come up in the course of my writing. More on that in a bit...</p></div>

I created my first webpage in the late 1990s and have tried to maintain the ability to do so ever since. I've kept several different personal URLs over the years, but my current one (<a href="https://chrbutler.com">chrbutler.com</a>) – just the shortest viable and available version of my name when I registered it – has endured the longest.</p>
<p>I've written professionally at several different places. <a href="https://newfangled.com">Newfangled.com</a> has been where I've published the most practical writing on interaction design. I wrote the Interaction design column for PRINT Magazine for several years, contributed to their blog as well as their sister publication, HOW Magazine, and wrote a book published by HOW Books called The Strategic Web Designer. I've also written for <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com">SmashingMagazine.com</a>.</p>
<p>But on my website, I'm less focused on a particular topic. I'm much more seasonal in the way I write there – sometimes longer, developed essays, sometimes very brief blog posts. Most of the time, I share my writing with my email list.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>What does your creative process look like when it comes to blogging?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>I keep a "Files" drive connected to my machine, and on it, a folder called "TEXTS." In it are a few sub-folders: Articles, Fragments, Journal, Notes. In those are thousands of .txt files. I back this up on another RAID drive and on the cloud.</p>
<p>Every day I create some kind of entry on that drive. If it's not a journal entry, I typically start with hastily writing down scattered comments about something I am thinking about and save it to the Notes folder. If I begin to develop that entry, I'll usually move it up to the root level. When it's finished, I file it under Articles. If it languishes for too long, I'll move it to Fragments. Every now and then, I mine the Fragments folder. Most of the time, I read over something and remark, "what on Earth was I thinking." But every now and then, I'll pull something back out of there and work on it again. A few months ago, I published an essay called "<a href="https://www.chrbutler.com/personal-machines-and-portable-worlds">Personal Machines and Portable Worlds</a>" that was the result of several resurrections from the Fragments folder – some nearly a decade old.</p>
<p>When I'm ready to publish something, I duplicate the .txt file to a Dropbox folder that syncs with my <a href="https://blot.im">Blot.im</a> account. Blot is a lovely, simple flat-file CMS. I've used it for many years now and would recommend it to anyone.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe the physical space influences your creativity?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>I have these childhood memories of visiting my sister's room, which was always in a state of near-chaos, and being inspired by the energy in there. She'd often be making things and always had a creative spark that was just so different from mine. I began to associate creativity and disorder, which, for me, has been a lifelong irony because, back then, I'd return to my room, which I'd probably just meticulously cleaned. I'm still that way – I put a huge amount of energy toward creating and maintaining order. I've learned over the years that creativity isn't dependent upon either disorder or order. Both can feed it.</p>
<p>And so both are present in my working space. I'll probably always lean more toward order (<a href="https://www.chrbutler.com/organization-office">this post on my setup will make that clear</a>), but the disorder comes from having a lot of variety available around me. I love having interesting things to look at – even just a glance at something can inspire me and fuel me through the day. I am constantly shuffling the things on my office's display shelves to feed my mind with images and ideas that I can use.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your tech stack?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>The post I referenced above will provide much more exhaustive detail on this, but to summarize:</p>
<p>I work at home, and my primary machine is an M1 Mac Mini. I haven't owned a laptop in many years. I like to keep my computer time focused in one place, for the most part (though I do have an iPad Mini, which is a very useful device and optimally sized, in my opinion). I connect into a large LG display and communicate via Zoom using a Sony a7c and a Shure SM7B connected through a Focusrite Scarlett interface.</p>
<p>I write with Ulysses and store all my text files on a 1TB NVMe SSD I assembled myself. I back up everything on a LaCIE RAID.</p>
<p>As I mentioned above, my blog is run on Blot.im and all its files are stored on Dropbox.</p>
<p>I'm an evangelist for maintaining an uninterruptible power supply (UPS). In a time of increasingly weird weather, power outages are becoming more common. The CyberPower CP1500 keeps us up and running so we can save our work and shutdown when we feel like it.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would you do anything differently?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>Content-wise, I don't think so. I like the personal nature of my website and how its variety reflects who I am. If I were motivated to build a larger audience and somehow monetize that attention, then specializing in some way would probably be necessary. But that's not what my website is for.</p>
<p>What my website is for is, first and foremost, to be a record for me. I like that it traces interests and modes over the years, and I like that it's there for anyone to see. On that note, it's also for making connections. I have made numerous friends through engaging online. These are relationships that have developed far beyond digital acquaintance – they've gone deep and lasted for many years. I met of my very good friends because I commented on his blog and then he on mine. I love that the internet makes this possible.</p>
<p>Technically and creatively, of course I am often itchy. I routinely want to try out a new technology or platform and experiment with the design. I've revamped my site plenty of times, but the ease of the flat-file approach on Blot is hard to trade in for something that might offer me more creative options. It makes it easy for me to write and publish things, which has always been the point.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>Financial question since the web is obsessed with money: how much does it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost or does it generate some revenue? And what&#039;s your position on people monetising personal blogs?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>The website's <em>direct</em>, yearly costs are:</p>
<ul>
<li>domain name registration: $16</li>
<li>blot.im account: $40</li>
<li>Dropbox account: $120</li>
</ul>
<p>Total: $176</p>
<p>That breaks down to ~$15/month, which is a pretty cheap price for such an enriching hobby, I think.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the site generates no revenue! Like some of your previous guests, it has created connections that have led to money through various side writing, speaking, or consulting work, but that's never been its purpose. When that happens, it's a nice thing, and I'm happy to leave it at that for now. (It has happened a handful of times, and in the aggregate, they have paid for the all-time costs of the site so far. I'd be fine with it if that wasn't true.)</p>
<p>My position on monetizing personal blogs is to each their own!</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth checking out? And also, who do you think I should be interviewing next?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>Patrick Tanguay's Sentiers (<a href="https://sentiers.media/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">sentiers.media</a>) is a must. I will read anything that Maciej Ceglowski (<a href="https://idlewords.com/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">idlewords.com</a>) writes. Erin Kissane recently wrapped a series examining Meta's role in the genocide of Rohingya people in Myanmar (<a href="https://erinkissane.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">erinkissane.com</a>).</p>
<p>Lara Hogan's wisdom overflows here: <a href="https://larahogan.me/">larahogan.me</a>. Reading Nicholas Magand (<a href="https://thejollyteapot.com/">thejollyteapot.com</a>) got me to loosen up on my blog. Maggie Appleton (<a href="https://maggieappleton.com/">maggieappleton.com</a>) is inspiring. I like Carl Barenbrug's blog (<a href="http://carlbarenbrug.com">carlbarenbrug.com</a>), Chris Hannah's (<a href="https://chrishannah.me/">chrishannah.me</a>), and Jose Gilgado's (<a href="https://josem.co/articles/">josem.co</a>). Scott Buffington's "Full Pints" posts always yield something of interest (<a href="https://irongeek.net/">irongeek.net</a>).</p>
<p>I just met Robert Rackley through my own blog and I've been enjoying catching up on his (<a href="https://canneddragons.net/">canneddragons.net</a>).</p>
<p>When it comes to the weird, I never miss a post from Håkan Blomqvist (<a href="https://ufoarchives.blogspot.com/">ufoarchives.blogspot.com</a>) or The Anomalist (<a href="https://www.anomalist.com">anomalist.com</a>).</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>Final question: is there anything you want to share with us?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>I wrapped my last episode of my <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/design-tomorrow/id1433919260">Design Tomorrow podcast</a> nearly five years ago, but I still think it's good and worth a listen.</p></div>

## Christmas gifts

date: 2023-12-22, from: Ayjay blog

In introducing the writings of George MacDonald, C. S. Lewis made a fascinating point which can only be quoted at length: What [MacDonald] does best is fantasy — fantasy that hovers between the allegorical and the mythopoeic. And this, in my opinion, he does better than any man. The critical problem with which we are [&#8230;]

## An update on HDR and color management in KWin

date: 2023-12-22, from: OS News

KWin now supports ICC profiles: In display settings you can set one for each screen, and KWin will use that to adjust the colors accordingly.  The Plasma 6 beta is already shipping with that implementation in KWin, and with a few additional steps you can play most HDR capable games in the Wayland session. ↫ Xaver Hugl I&#8217;ll admit colour management and HDR is a bit outside my wheelhouse, but I do know both are essentially vital for quite a few digital professions, and that support for them on Wayland specifically has been subpar or missing entirely. It seems progress is being made on these topics, and that&#8217;s good news.

## Bricked Xmas

date: 2023-12-22, from: OS News

I also had another set of addressable lights on my desk. While decorating my office for Christmas, I decided to invest some time in connecting them to Home Assistant using the BJ_LED code as a template. It should have been straightforward, right? Well, yes, but also no. ↫ Will Cooke We all love a good reverse-engineering story, especially if it involves bricking Christmas lights.

## Microsoft deprecates Mixed Reality from Windows

date: 2023-12-22, from: OS News

And the culling of Windows features continues. Windows Mixed Reality is deprecated and will be removed in a future release of Windows. This deprecation includes the Mixed Reality Portal app, and Windows Mixed Reality for SteamVR and Steam VR Beta. ↫ Microsoft&#8217;s &#8220;Deprecated features for Windows client&#8221; page All this mixed reality stuff was a big push in Windows, up to the point Microsoft added applications and dedicated folders for it to Windows. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever seen anyone use any of it. The Verge notes Microsoft has been downsizing its VR efforts for a while now, and it seems the company is bailing on the VR hypetrain.

## NASA Flies Drones Autonomously for Air Taxi Research

date: 2023-12-22, from: NASA breaking news

Researchers at NASA’s Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia recently flew multiple drones beyond visual line of sight with no visual observer. The drones successfully flew around obstacles and each other during takeoff, along a planned route, and upon landing, all autonomously without a pilot controlling the flight.

## A Frivolous Feature

date: 2023-12-22, from: Marginallia log

Marginalia Search very recently gained the ability to filter results by Autonomous System, not only searching by ASN but by the organization information for that AS. At a glance this seems like a somewhat frivolous feature, but it has interesting effects.
Autonomous Systems are part of the Internet&rsquo;s routing infrastructure. If your mental model of an IP number is that they are the phone number of the computer, this is something akin to a postal code.

## TCapture Replication Server 1.0 Beta

date: 2023-12-22, from: PostgreSQL News

<p>We are pleased to announce the upcoming release of TCapture Replication Server 1.0 Beta
We are currently releasing a beta version for community testing.</p>
<p>TCapture is a bidirectional multi master replication server based on a 'capture and apply' asynchronous replica engine</p>
<p>Key Features</p>
<ul>
<li>Transactional. SQL are captured transactionally, can be coupled with surrounding business logic.</li>
<li>Efficient. It capture transactions for replication from Write-Ahead Logs (WAL) instead of using triggers, eliminating overhead on master databases and significantly reduces latency</li>
<li>Flexible. No limits on the number of producers or consumers, but complexity increases</li>
<li>Reliable. Transactions are stored in PostgreSQL database – this adds the benefit of write ahead logging and crash recovery.</li>
<li>Transparent. No impact on the applications already running on that database, since both engine and 'store database' can run separate from production databases.</li>
<li>Easy to use. Simple to set up and configure, is an  effective tool for data replication between different Postgres versions</li>
<li>Open Source. No licensing fees, but occasionally you'll have to get your hands dirty</li>
</ul>
<p>About TCapture
https://github.com/lab-sb/tcrepsrv-dev</p>
<p>To help you get started with TCapture, we have provided the following resources:

## Unblocking user freedom: the right to use adblockers

date: 2023-12-21, from: OS News

Advertisements are a part of our lives, including our digital ones. They are in the websites we browse, the search results we receive, and the online news we read. Tired of receiving so many ads, some users try to avoid them by installing an adblocker. But is this a legal practice? Is using adblockers an act of restricting market autonomy, or do they help achieve user freedom? Imagine a scenario where website owners hold copyright over their websites, including whatever ads they place, and could effectively sue for copyright infringement if users were to remove or suppress ads when visiting these websites. This hypothetical situation would enable any website copyright holder to use the legal system to stop any ordinary user on the internet who tries to bypass these ads. This would lead to an internet where unsolicited information and advertisements are imposed on users. Fortunately, recent court decisions have at least prevented this hypothetical from becoming a reality in Germany. ↫ FSFE Good. My position has always been clear: your computer, your rules. Block ads to your heart&#8217;s content. Even on OSNews &#8211; block away if you want. There are far better ways to support us, anyway (Patreon, Ko-Fi, Liberapay, merch).

## State Restoration With NSSecureCoding on Sonoma

## ChatGPT is my CSS advisor

date: 2023-12-21, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>People who don't program must not have any idea how much of a boon ChatGPT is to us programmers. </p>
<p>I am doing <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/">CSS</a> coding far in advance of my previous capability. When I know something is possible, but I haven't the slightest idea how to specify it, I just ask, in my own words. </p>
<p>For example, a very common thing to want to do is to put a : after the text in the first column every row of a table. </p>
<p>So I <a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/b19c1c8d-3e19-4039-86aa-803eb7cf46d6">asked ChatGPT</a> how to do it, in English, as I did above. This is what it came up with:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>tr td:first-child::after {content: ":";}</code></li>
</ul>
<p>When you see it like that you can almost figure out what's going on if you squint and close one eye. </p>
<p>And it works. I literally shrieked when it did. </p>
<p>Now I am the boss of CSS.. </p>
<p>Nice.</p>

Local philanthropists and news leaders have pioneered a concept known as the Community News Fund (CNF), raising tens of millions of dollars for local news and inspiring a wave of others to jump in. The concept is simple yet effective, often starting as a partnership between a community foundation and a local newsroom to establish...

## User-centric editorial models embrace empathy and scale

date: 2023-12-21, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

The generalist times in the media are over. Differentiation is the name of the game; &#8220;riches in niches&#8221; is the often-used motto.

## The obsession with “trust” will end

My prediction for 2024 is that journalists will realize that &#8220;trust&#8221; is a useless metric of their work. Okay, I&#8217;m kidding.

## Channels change the publishing game on WhatsApp

date: 2023-12-21, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

When I started thinking about WhatsApp strategy for publishers years ago, communication on the platform was largely limited to groups of 256 participants. A handful of services allowed users to send messages to larger groups, but they operated in gray areas of the platform&#8217;s T&#38;Cs — until they didn&#8217;t.

In the years since 2020, some major newsrooms have made some progress with worker diversity, both at management and staffer levels.

Continued attrition and major newsroom crackdowns on journalists expressing their views about being a person experiencing life through historically...

## CP/M ported to to 30-year-old digital typewriter

date: 2023-12-21, from: OS News

CP/M is an operating system dating to the mid-1970s that found its niche giving cheap 8-bit home computers the flexibility, if not the power, of expensive workstations.

## Mac OS 9 is still alive and kicking… And that’s not a bad thing

date: 2023-12-21, from: OS News

So what can you do with it? Well, let’s first address the elephant in the room – the internet is still lousy on OS 9. Despite Cameron Kaiser’s genius effort put into his Classilla browser project, he’s pretty much squeezed every ounce of usability from the now 20+ year old underlying networking frameworks. A lot of websites still render “ok” in the browser, but most of the modern web will simply cause it to spit back an error. Also, file sharing with other machines on your network takes a bit more forethought these days as OS 9’s implementation of AppleTalk will only work with OS X versions up to 10.4 Tiger. In Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard) and later, AppleTalk will not function at all without some difficult technical workarounds, so a “bridge” Mac is generally recommended (for those not familiar with that term – bridge Macs are machines that can handle both legacy and modern technologies and can be networked between both old and new hardware). It is also possible to wring out a bit more usability by setting up a web proxy such as macHTTP and running a small Netatalk server on one of your modern Macs (this is something I’d like to feature in the future). ↫ Adam Goff at Low End Mac Running Mac OS 9 today has become somewhat of a rite of passage for retrocomputing and operating system nerds (&#8230;2006), and every few years a new article about the experience makes the rounds. For good reason, too &#8211; OS 9 is fun, quirky, has tons of software to play around with, and still looks and feels great.

## Vibe Check №30

date: 2023-12-21, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>The year is almost over. The weather is delightful in Austin and walking the neighborhood is a joy. Happiness arrives in holiday cards. The tree is up and the ambient stress of moonlighting as an assistant to a jolly, fat norseman takes its toll. The power grid still hums but –the question on every Texan’s mind– for how long?</p>
<p>There’s a lot going on behind the scenes, big life changes, but here’s some of the highlights (nay, lowlights?) from the past couple months.</p>
<h2>My wife’s back went out</h2>
<p>Right after my last vibe check my wife’s back went out. We’re not sure what caused it, but this was the most severe episode she’s ever experienced. One parent down had a massive impact on our quality of life. November productivity was a wash due as I scrambled to assist her, visiting doctors, and assuming a large swath of family responsibilities. She is so much better at keeping the family gears turning, I was drowning.</p>
<p>After some successful PT she’s doing much better and we’re almost back to where we were before November, which is welcome. And our kids pitched in and helped as best they could, I’m thankful for that.</p>
<h2>Covid strikes again</h2>
<p>The week after Thanksgiving my beautiful daughter comes into our room at night and is restless. In a moment of uncool dadsmanship I inform her that she’s snoring too loud. A steam shower fixed the issue, poor kid. A couple days later I started to feel ill… then I felt terrible… then I tested positive for Covid. Oof.</p>
<p>This one laid me out pretty good with that terrible incurable headache and sandbag-like sinus gunk. I spent six days sick and isolated, whisking myself away like a goddamed phantom of the opera whenever my family came home. No one else tested positive, but seems like a clear case that my daughter carried it home from school after the break and gave it to me, the immune system deprived remote worker; a blank petri dish ripe for infection.</p>
<p>I’m all better now, but let me say getting Covid the first week of December puts you super far behind in your Christmas shopping.</p>
<h2>The Great Subscription Culling</h2>
<p>After interviewing family members about what shows they actually watch from each service and organizing it all in a spreadsheet, I nuked about $100 worth of monthly subscriptions. Services including but not limited to…</p>
<ul>
<li>Streaming: Peacock, Disney/Hulu, YouTube Premium, Apple One, Dropout, Crunchyroll</li>
<li>Community: Some Patreons, some Discord boosts</li>
</ul>
<p>The hard thing is that I like these services. I find value in them… just not all at the same time. How are we going to live without them? Well there’s some strategy…</p>
<ol>
<li>On-demand services - If we want Service X more than Netlfix, we cancel Netflix.</li>
<li>Move to the ad-supported version of services (YouTube, Disney/Hulu) - Way cheaper and if we all hate the ads, we can decide as a family to remove them.</li>
<li>Ask for some as gifts (Dropout, Crunchyroll) - A monthly service fee for entertainment for one person in the household is excessive… but those make great gifts! It’s some bank account slight of hand, but I can enjoy my weird Gundam obsession guilt free.</li>
</ol>
<p>On that note, a ShopTalk listener heard wind about my plans and graciously gifted me a subscription to Crunchyroll. Incredibly thoughtful. Thank you, Melanie.</p>
<p>I think Subscription Culling should be a national holiday we do every equinox. If streaming services are going to raise prices every quarter, we should normalize the threat of abandoning them en masse.</p>
<h2>Stats</h2>
<p>Data rules everything around me. These take a long time, I wonder if I could automate this.</p>
<h3>💪 Fitness</h3>
<ul>
<li>Still in <a href="https://daverupert.com/2023/10/the-plan-and-the-plateau/">the plateau</a>, not a pound different after two months.</li>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/48FMBof">The Big Myth</a> - A dismantling of the idea about the invisible hand of the market. Paired with other books I’ve read this year, you see how “That’s socialism!” is a propaganda dogwhistle to cover for a much bigger lie that unfettered capitalism works. Starting back in the union busting days because people were getting their arms cut off in the machines, businesses began promoting the idea that regulating business is bad. The conservative thinktank at the Chicago school of economics developed the lie by cherry-picking and bastardizing Adam Smith’s writings to suit their “greed is good” agenda. I never knew Milton Friedman was a person I could get mad at… but here we are. This lie was then carried on by GE propagandists like (former SAG union president) Ronald Reagan who popularized trickle down economics during his US presidency and continued with neoliberal bank deregulation in the Clinton administration. The too-big-to-failures of the market never fall on the corporations, it’s always on the public and the taxpayer. [/rant]</li>

<h3>📺 Media</h3>
<p>Big period of media consumption. Got back into podcasts and cleared out the queue pretty well.</p>
<p><strong>Movies</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Barbie - Great movie, not sure about the ending where <code>&lt;spoiler&gt;</code>they decide to preserve gender inequality?<code>&lt;/spoiler&gt;</code>… but still a good movie.</li>
<li>David Holmes: The Boy Who Lived (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/David-Holmes-Boy-Who-Lived/dp/B0CJX6K6TD">Prime</a>) - The story of Daniel Radcliffe’s stunt double David Holmes who was tragically paralyzed in an injury during the filming of the 7th film in the series.</li>

<p><strong>Anime</strong></p>
<p>Lots of Gundam and auditioned a few shows but nothing stuck.</p>
<ul>
<li>Build Fighters Try S2 (Crunchyroll) - Build Fighters is fun… this one was a bit less fun than the first.</li>
<li>Zeta Gundam (Crunchyroll) - Zeta Gundam is great but choppy, I frequently backtrack because I feel like if I look away for one second I miss a major reveal.</li>
<li>∀ Gundam E01-30 (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GundamInfo">GundamInfo</a>) - INCREDIBLE. Set in the far future on a different timeline, the technologically advanced Moonrace invades the primitive Earth. A Gundam from a time long ago is found. It’s not a story about fighting robots so much as a story about people who find themselves in the middle of a war. It’s more like a Ghibli than a Gundam. I wish I had finished this but GundamInfo took the videos down. 😭</li>
<li>Mobile Suit Gundam Reconguista in G Vol 1 (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GundamInfo">GundamInfo</a>) - Also good… but GundamInfo took it down before I could finish all 5 movies.</li>

## Heads up: RPM GPG keys are changing on 3 Jan 2024 (  RHEL and Fedora )

date: 2023-12-21, from: PostgreSQL News

<p>As a part of having new x86_64 build instances, we updated all of the RPM signing keys to meet FIPS requirements (except RHEL7, where updated GPG
keys will appear but not meet FIPS requirement) for RHEL 9, 8 and 7 (and their derivatives), and Fedora 39 &amp; 38. Existing keys are weak and throwing warnings to many users.</p>
<p>We will also update aarch64 and ppc64le signing keys as well.</p>
<p>New repo RPMs, the new keys and RPMs re-signed with the new keys will be published on 3 January 2024. </p>
<p>If you want to receive updates from the PostgreSQL RPM repo after 3 January 2024, you'll need to update the repository RPM and install new keys. We will publish detailed information and howto in <a href="https://yum.postgresql.org">https://yum.postgresql.org</a> before new year.</p>
<p>There will be no change in the SLES 15 and SLES 12 RPMS, at least for now.</p>

## Integrating Android applications into GNOME and KDE on mobile using Sailfish OS’ aliendalvik

date: 2023-12-20, from: OS News

Plasma 6 is coming together nicely on the desktop! Coming back from hiatus, I was pleasantly greeted by a much more working session than when I last saw it in May; I have now completely switched over to it on my main machine! On the other hand, there is still a lot of work to do on mobile to prepare it for the Plasma 6 release in February. I will outline the current situation and the work I have done in the past few months in order to make Plasma 6 a possibility for Plasma Mobile. ↫ Devin at espi.dev The linked blog post provides a great overview of the work that is being done and needs to be done on Plasma Mobile for Plasma 6, and I have to say that it&#8217;s definitely looking good and I&#8217;m quite interested is somehow giving Plasma Mobile a go. The problem, however, is one that&#8217;s all too familiar to anyone who&#8217;s tried to run anything but Android or iOS as their main mobile operating system over the past 15 years or so: the lack of the kind of applications that you need to be a part of modern society. I don&#8217;t like it, but without my banking applications, identity applications I need in Sweden, things like WhatsApp, Signal, Discord &#8211; my phone would basically be a curious toy instead of a useful tool. Add needing the best possible smartphone camera to the equation &#8211; I have two small kids &#8211; and using anything but iOS and Android is simply out of the question. One alternative smartphone operating system knew this, and implemented fairly transparent Android application compatibility &#8211; Sailfish &#8211; through their Aliendalvik tool. It seems Jonas Dreßler, who works on GNOME Shell for mobile, was curious, and decided to take a closer look at Aliendalvik, to see if there&#8217;s anything there that the teams working on bringing KDE and GNOME to smartphones can make something of it. Sadly, Aliendalvik is not open source, so some reverse-engineering was required. The interesting thing here is that due to the fairly standard userspace Sailfish is using, the Android integration is mostly using standard freedesktop APIs to integrate with the host OS: Running Android apps are exposed as individual Wayland surfaces/windows, notifications from Android appear as org.freedesktop.Notification messages on DBus, music player controls are exposed using MPRIS, and even text input for android apps can be provided using the Wayland text input protocol. This means that basically Aliendalvik should work just as well on a standard Linux distribution like Fedora, Arch Linux, or Debian. The Android container can be started using standard linux container tooling and the host integration binaries are compiled for ARM64 and mostly link to various open source Qt libraries. ↫ Jonas Dreßler After a few days of reverse-engineering, hacking, and lots of other hard work, Dreßler managed to get Aliendalvik to work on GNOME Shell running on Arch on a smartphone, with all the integration between the Android applicatins and the underlying Arch installation working, and the code and instructions are up on Github. He also posted a video showing it working, and it&#8217;s indeed as impressive as it sounds. Sadly, the elephant in the room here is, of course, the fact that Aliendalvik is not open source. Jolla could potentially offer it for purchase on non-Sailfish Linux-based smartphones, or perhaps even release it as open source entirely, but I&#8217;m not entirely sure if Jolla would be interested in any of that. The company is&#8230; In a bit of an odd state, and I feel like it&#8217;s mostly been in limbo with not as much progress as they once hoped they&#8217;d make. Releasing one of their crown jewels as open source seems unlikely. My personal conviction is that if we ever want a Linux smartphone that is somewhat viable but isn&#8217;t Android, it&#8217;s going to have to be either Plasma Mobile or GNOME Shell on mobile, running on one of the popular, mainstream distributions that already run on ARM, are interested in mobile, and have a huge community to power the whole thing. Things like Sailfish or even Ubuntu Touch, as interesting and impressive as they are, just don&#8217;t seem viable to me in the long term when the entirety of the KDE and GNOME communities are working on their own projects.

## Here’s how Android app sideloading & third-party billing will change following settlement

date: 2023-12-20, from: OS News

One of the changes Google is forced to make because of the antitrust trial vs. Epic concerns how sideloading works on Android. Right now, sideloading an app on Android requires users to open an APK and, if the source app is not already approved, follow a link to settings where that option can be enabled before they can return to the installation process. Following the changes outlined in this settlement, Android will be required to simplify this process by condensing it down to one screen. Android will still be able to outline the risks of sideloading on this screen, but it will be a one-step process. The new screen will say: ↫ Ben Schoon at 9to5Google I&#8217;m not sure if this is a better approach. The way I have sideloading set up on my Android devices is that only File, Google&#8217;s file manager for Android, is allowed to install any APK, so even if, for some reason, I download a harmful APK accidentally through a phishing email or my browser, it will just sit inert in my downloads folder until I were to actively open Files and install said APK. It&#8217;s safeguard I most likely don&#8217;t need, but I do like having installing APKs limited to just the Google file manager for my own peace of mind. This change would, if I&#8217;m reading things correctly, make it so that any application can more easily be given the permission to install APKs, which seems like it&#8217;s not going to encourage many more people to intentionally sideload, but will perhaps make people accidentally grant random applications the permission to do so. It&#8217;s an odd change, for sure, and I hope there&#8217;s some way to disable this if Google implements this outside of the US as well.

## Microsoft deprecates legacy console feature

date: 2023-12-20, from: OS News

The culling of Windows features you&#8217;ve never heard of but that will affect hundreds of thousands of people because Windows is just that popular so even an unknown feature is used by gobs of people continues. The legacy console mode is deprecated and no longer being updated. In future Windows releases, it will be available as an optional Feature on Demand.

## Chinese telecom giant Huawei pushes forward with ambitious plan to dethrone Android

date: 2023-12-20, from: OS News

Hundreds of technical experts from many of China’s biggest state-owned and private companies, including the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), China Telecom, Meituan, and Baidu, all gathered in Beijing last month. The purpose behind the meeting was for their staff to receive training so they could be certified as developers on Huawei’s Harmony Operation System (OS). While most observers were looking the other way, Huawei has been quietly building an independent Chinese operating system that isn’t subject to U.S. sanctions. In the four years after the telecom giant was banned from using Google apps, the Shenzhen-based company has been making significant strides toward achieving its long-term goal: To dethrone Android and make its HarmonyOS the default operating system in China. ↫ Nina Xiang for Forbes Asia HarmonyOS is poised to succeed in beating iOS and Android where others have failed, if only because the Chinese state is pushing homegrown solutions hard. It&#8217;s already hit 10% market share in China, closing in on iOS&#8217; 17%, but still kilometres away from Android&#8217;s 72%. However, with both local governments and the government in Beijing enacting all kinds of laws and guidelines to force companies, institutions, and people to switch to homegrown solutions, it wouldn&#8217;t surprise me to see this market share climb fast. And that&#8217;s actually okay! Setting aside the fact the Chinese government is a genocidal totalitarian surveillance nightmare apparatus, I think it&#8217;s entirely understandable, reasonable, and a good investment to have homegrown technology solutions and platforms. I wish the European Union did something similar, but that ship has probably sailed after we let Microsoft gut whatever was left of Nokia after Apple was done with it.

## They're letting us have RSS

date: 2023-12-20, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Assume that FB doesn't really want to interop, so that's why there's a year timeline on developing AP functionality. No rush. Let's keep growing and later on we can have an app store that only lets certain sites into our world, subject to our turning them off at any time. </p>
<p>Assuming this is true, RSS is their worst nightmare. It's implemented in a week, if you're really careful and there are good toolkits for every platform, and lots of developers know what to do with it, and even worse, there already is a huge installed base of such apps and they all have <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/vociferous">vociferous</a> users who would be thrilled to be heard, because they largely feel like they're pissing in the wind. I am doing CSS coding far in advance of my previous capability, when I know something is possible, but I haven't the slightest idea how to specify it. </p>
<p>Remember they said RSS is Dead. I always felt that was aimed at me, but it was aimed at them too, even more so.</p>
<p>The thing to do, build -- intelligently, slowly, showing interop at every step. Watch out for people who take stuff out with out putting back. </p>

## NASA’s Hubble Presents a Holiday Globe of Stars

The billion stars in galaxy UGC 8091 resemble a sparkling snow globe in this festive Hubble Space Telescope image from NASA and ESA (European Space Agency). The dwarf galaxy is approximately 7 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Virgo. It is considered an “irregular galaxy” because it does not have an orderly spiral or […]

If journalism wants to help inform the populace of the stakes, I'd like them to stop using the term neo-Nazi. There's nothing new about being a Nazi. It adds a tiny bit of confusion at exactly the point where you want zero confusion. It took journalism a long time to use the term insurrection about the January 6 events, that hurt us too. Understand where the path we're on leads, and don't give people a reason to hope that it's not as serious as it is.

## Journalism’s identity crisis intensifies, and decentralization ensues

## 55 Years Ago: Seven Months Before the Moon Landing

December 1968 ended a year more turbulent than most. For the American space program, however, it brought the Moon landing one giant step closer. The successful first lunar orbital flight by Apollo 8 astronauts Frank Borman, James A. Lovell, and William A. Anders proved the space worthiness of the Apollo Command and Service Modules (CSM) [&#8230;]

## Hex time

date: 2023-12-20, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1>Hex time</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>My wife left to spend the day in a spa with a friend of hers and I
  am listening to Louis Armstrong recordings from the 1930s.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I read a discussion between <a class="account" href="https://dice.camp/@munroe" title="@munroe@dice.camp">@munroe</a> and <a class="account" href="https://dice.camp/@Da_Gut" title="@Da_Gut@dice.camp">@Da_Gut</a>
about hex sizes for a hexcrawl. My personal take is to think of hexes
as distances one can travel in a certain time.</p>

<p>Think about the diversity of the landscape one can see in a day of
travel. Arable lands and a forest. Two regions? Arable lands, a
forest, hills, a plateau. Four? That is the number of hexes per day.
And nobody cares about the miles.</p>

<p>In my case, I think that &ldquo;one hex is one day of walking&rdquo; makes the most
sense. In the morning, you&rsquo;re leaving one hex and in the afternoon
you&rsquo;re arriving in the next hex. This assumes an uncharted wilderness.
When I try to leave the forest trails in the hills around Zürich or in
the Swiss mountains, I feel that progress is really slow. Super slow.
Extremely slow. Sure, I can walk as far as the horizon in some cases,
but that&rsquo;s on gravel roads prepared by industrial machines and
maintained by a state that is fed by all the tax evading billionaires
and conglomerates of the whole planet. So out there in Fantasy land,
it&rsquo;s more like me trying to find a shortcut in the Swiss mountains and
forests.</p>

<p>And sure, if people have horses and mules to carry their stuff, they
can travel faster. Twice as fast makes it easy to move the little
token around on the map. And roads also speed things up. Like, twice
as fast? With horses and mules to carry stuff, on a flat road: 4 hexes
per day. If you want to read up on ancient rows, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historic_roads_and_trails">historic roads
and trails</a>
on Wikipedia.</p>

<p>Regular exploration of the wilderness where the players are strangers,
intruders, colonizers, potential murderers, belonging to the
wannabe-conquerors, then surely it&rsquo;s going to be 1 hex per day. This
is the equivalent of slow and careful dungeon exploration speed. Avoid
getting lost in the bogs, crossing the rivers and creeks without
losing your stuff, without getting ambushed in gullies and canyons,
without getting lost in forests, without slipping into ravines,
spraining angles or scraping your knees, keeping dry, finding good
camping sites, digging a latrine, digging a fire pit, washing clothes,
maintaining equipment, baking bread, and on and on. This is the speed
you can maintain for long expeditions.</p>

<p>Now, you can get into all the nitty-gritty of it all. Luckily,
<a class="account" href="https://rollenspiel.social/@settembrini" title="@settembrini@rollenspiel.social">@settembrini</a> already did all that and wrote <a href="https://hofrat.rsp-blogs.de/2023/12/01/inch-by-inch-its-all-a-cinch-by-the-yard-its-hard/">Inch
by inch it’s all a cinch, by the yard it’s
hard</a>.
It&rsquo;s a long article and not an easy read. But here&rsquo;s one of the things
I can put into my gamer notes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1 hour’s walk = 1 league = 3 miles = 3000 double paces = 15 000
feet= 5000 yards.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So let&rsquo;s go back to my example. Using the above equivalences, 8 hours
of walking takes you 24 miles out in the open, on a road or well kept
and straight trail. At the same time, I said that 1 day of walking is
2 hexes in my world, without mules or horses. So now we know: one day
of walking is 24 miles and 2 hexes. Therefore my hexes should be 12 miles
across, if you really need to know.</p>

<p>But of course you don&rsquo;t because nothing happens &ldquo;per mile&rdquo; in the
game. All the things happen &ldquo;per unit of time&rdquo;. The most important one
of these is &ldquo;how many random encounters per day?&rdquo; Or &ldquo;per 4 hour
watch?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m serious about one thing, however: It&rsquo;s better if you don&rsquo;t think
about the miles per hex. If you do, you&rsquo;ll keep thinking about all the
other things, too. How far was your hike last summer? Did you have to
set up camp? How heavy was your backpack? Did you wear armour? Is
travelling by horse really faster than walking by foot if you can&rsquo;t
switch horses? How fast are you if you have two horses per person? How
fast is a wagon. The questions are endless and somehow I find them all
very boring questions. These are not <a href="2023-01-20_The_power_of_questions.md">good
questions</a>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s better if you think about what&rsquo;s important in the game for you
and the table and go from there. Is the world dangerous because of
random encounters? Start with the question of how often you want to
roll for random encounters as the party travels from landmark to
landmark. Think about the distances between settlements.
Traditionally, that would be about a day&rsquo;s march by foot in arable
land: half a day out and do a bit of work and half a day back is the
limit.</p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s say you answered the above with &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to roll once for
random encounters per day of travel&rdquo;. And every landmark has
something: either it&rsquo;s arable land so there are people living there, a
camp, a hamlet, a village, or it&rsquo;s dangerous because of a monster
lair, or because of a natural hazard like mountains, swamps, deep
forest, or something else that&rsquo;s similarly inhospitable.</p>

<p>If you follow this train of thought then you&rsquo;ll arrive at my setup:
the slowest speed is one hex per day, and then there are ways to speed
things up with transporation methods and infrastructure. Take a boat
downriver or along the coast: 8 hexes per day? More? What about taking
a boat upriver? Just as slow as walking but you can unlimited
supplies? How far can the flying carpet go? All these questions need
settling, eventually. All I am concerned about right now, however, is
that they can be answered in principle: a certain multiple of the
slowest speed is good enough.</p>

<p>The only good argument for switching things up that I can think of is
wanting to present more variety to your players. No problem. If the
land is full of stuff, a river ford, a tower ruin, then up onto the
plateau and into the moors until you reach the cairns of Arguable, you
can scale it up. Multiply it all by two or three or four and you&rsquo;re
good to go. I find that this leads to a lot more mapping and so I
don&rsquo;t do it, but if you feel like it, you have my blessings.</p>

<p>If you are like me and prefer more diversity in theory but cannot be
bothered to map in practice, I have a suggestion: start with the
sparse map and keep adding. Using the example above, there&rsquo;s a hex
with a settlement, and the next hex is hills, and there&rsquo;s a river
between the two. You can improvise a story about the fields giving way
to brushland, the river winding its way between the willows and the
ford with the poles of King Borgobob who raised them in the times of
your grandfather, and then there&rsquo;s that plateau. If the players don&rsquo;t
look for the tower, it does not show up. But if the players know about
the old tower you add a tower symbol to the hill hex and presto, one
more landmark in the same hex. They know about the cairn, too? Then
it&rsquo;s a tower and a cairn. You can even number the sides of a hex: 1 is
north, 2 is south-east, 3 is south-west, and so on. Then your notes
can say &ldquo;1: cairn, 4: old tower&rdquo; and depending on how the party
crosses the hexes, you&rsquo;ll know whether they pass by the thing or
wether they can spot it from a distance or whether they&rsquo;ll have to
search for it.</p>

<p>I also like to label geographic features. Label settlements, forests,
mountains, swamps, rivers, trails. I feel that adds so much.</p>

<p>Down below is a snapshot of the player map in my German Greyhawk
campaign where I run the Elredd region on the Wild Coast. How long
does it take to travel from Elredd to Moorwies along the
Miesbohlenweg? 1 hex/day in the wilderness, 2 hexes/day on the road:
From Elredd to Brackmühl is a day, from Brackmühl to Kreuzdorf is a
day, and from Kreuzdorf to Moorwies is half a day, or perhaps the
swamp slows things down and the road is shit so it&rsquo;s a full day. So
three days total. If you had horses, then it&rsquo;s one day from Elredd to
Kreuzdorf, and then the shit trackway into the swamp… a second day? Or
maybe you can travel right through Moorwies and out of the swamp on
the other side. But my players don&rsquo;t know what lies to the west…</p>

<p>OK, but now I have a different problem. <a class="account" href="https://rollenspiel.ch/users/settembrini" title="@settembrini@rollenspiel.ch">@settembrini</a>
says that each hex is 10 km across. Now what? Let&rsquo;s take those
equivalences again and add a rough conversion to kilometers. 3 miles ×
1½ km/mi = 4½ km or 5000 years × 9/10 m/yard = 4500 m = 4½ km. Let&rsquo;s
round that to 5 km – or in keeping with this blog post: a 10 km hex
takes 2 h to walk through and in 8 h you can walk through 4 hexes, if
you&rsquo;re on a road, 2 hexes cross-country, 8 hexes if you ride on a good
road. Speed is sort-of doubled because 12 mi × 1½ km/mi = 18 km which
is nearly twice as much as 10 km.</p>

<p>So bow how long does it take to travel from Elredd to Moorwies along
the Miesbohlen way? 1 day from Elredd to Kreuzdorf. Plus 2 h on the
next day.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1 hour’s walk = 1 league = 3 miles = 3000 double paces = 15 000
feet= 5000 yards = 5 km</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My point with all of this: keep in mind how the map relates to events
in your <a href="-20_Hexcrawl_Procedure2012-06-20_Hexcrawl_Procedure">hexcrawl
procedure</a>. With
the &ldquo;new&rdquo; ruling handed down to me regarding my map, I keep the idea
that there is a single encounter check to be made during the day (and
one to be made during the night if the party is camping out in the
open).</p>

**@Ayjay blog** (date: 2023-12-20, from: Ayjay blog)

Brian Eno, from a 1995 diary entry: Whatever you now find weird, ugly, uncomfortable and nasty about a new medium will surely become its signature. CD distortion, the jitteriness of digital video, the crap sound of 8-bit – all these will be cherished and emulated as soon as they can be avoided.  It’s the sound [&#8230;]

## There's actual news tonight

date: 2023-12-20, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I've been watching the <a href="https://www.memeorandum.com/231219/p55#a231219p55">news</a> tonight, when there's some <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-insurrection-14th-amendment-2024-colorado-d16dd8f354eeaf450558378c65fd79a2">actual</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/12/19/us/trump-colorado-ballot-news#trump-colorado-ballot-14th-amendment">news</a>, and it's <i>good</i> news. </p>

Not impotent tools, like congressional hearings or impeachment, but the actual guardrail meant to serve as a <a href="https://constitution.findlaw.com/amendment14/annotation15.html">last resort</a> to keep a nightmare out of the government.  An insurrectionist should be dealt with a lot more swiftly than Trump has and the penalty should be harsh to warn off other would-be coup plotters. But -- better late than never. </p>
<p>And if they want to have a civil war, okay -- better to do it when the military is under constitutional control, at least theoretically. Tell the Republicans to try again, now before any primary votes have been cast. This candidate is prohibited from being president, as if he were born outside the United States. Not qualified. </p>

## WARC'in the crawler

date: 2023-12-20, from: Marginallia log

The Marginalia Crawler has seen improvements! A long term problem with the crawler design is that if for whatever reason the crawler shuts down, then it needs to re-start fetching whatever domains it was currently traversing during the termination from zero.
This isn&rsquo;t fantastic, since not only does crawling a website take a fair bit of time, it&rsquo;s a nuisance for the server admins to re-crawl stuff that was already fetched, and a real liability for ending up in robots.

<li>Meta AI will comment on questions that haven't gotten an answer after one hour</li>

<li>Meta AI's answers will summarize earlier group discussions and share past posts from the group, helping to build community and spark discussion</li>

<li>Stay in control</li>
<ul>
<li>You'll be able to delete any of Meta AI's comments, turn it off anytime, and customize it for your group</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>A thought -- this kind of feature could not have been offered a year ago. The online world and journalism would never have accepted it from Facebook. But now they're called Meta and that seems to matter. ChatGPT has created a new opening. Not sure I'm going to like it, esp since this is mostly a one-way group. It's not for discussions. But it's the only group they offered to, and I love this stuff and want to know more.</p>
<p>I haven't told the members of the group that I've requested this. Am I obligated to do that?  </p>
<p>Also in private groups where people reveal personal info (not the purpose of this group) I could see where this would be very controversial.</p>

## Keeping one Game Gear out of the landfill

<p>I was sent a <a href="https://www.zegamamegear.uk/zega-mame-gear">Zega Mame Gear</a> kit by John Maddison, of Zarcade, in April this year. I bought a Game Gear shell off eBay for $15, some extra buttons, switches, screws, and a new glass screen cover from <a href="https://handheldlegend.com">Handheld Legend</a>, and I could <em>finally</em> find a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 for sale last month.</p>

<p>So I put all that together into a modern RetroPie handheld emulation build, and now I can play through games I only <em>wish</em> I could've played in my childhood. Being the third child, I was typically relegated to 'trying to cram in some time on the console before the game rental was due back' status.</p>

## We’ll see partisan media more clearly

date: 2023-12-19, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

In the middle of the 20th century, a certain model of professional journalism reached peak levels of influence in the U.S. This model promised objectivity and non-partisanship, unlike most American journalism that had preceded it. For a few decades, then, the partisan press and the many quandaries partisan journalism had long posed for democracy appeared...

## Music at The Colony

date: 2023-12-19, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I went to my first since-pandemic live show, at <a href="https://www.colonywoodstock.com/">The Colony</a> in Woodstock. It's small venue that <a href="https://buildingsofnewengland.com/2022/09/11/the-colony-hotel-1927/">goes way back</a>. It's basically a bar, with a stage and a small seating area which can hold about 50 people, seated at tables. Very comfortable space. Woodstock as you might imagine is a great place for live music, one of the reasons I moved here, the other being that it's a magnet for creative people, like a lot of the other places I've lived (New Orleans, Cambridge, Berkeley, Madison, Seattle, New York). But the pandemic squashed that, now maybe we're starting to come back. </p>
<p><div class="divInlineImage"><center><img class="imgInline" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/12/19/levinBrothers.png"></center>The Levin Brothers band at The Colony, Sunday night. </div></p>
<p>I decided to risk it because a friend was playing last night, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Levin">Tony Levin</a>, who I know through his wife, Andi. When I first met Tony, at a birthday dinner last year, I thought he was a banker. He's tall, an impressive-looking person, like the people who rose to be an executive at companies like IBM in the 80s. Just shows how deceiving appearances can be. He's an accomplished musician, and a very sweet, quiet person. Probably about as far from an IBM exec or banker as you can get. Until Sunday I had never seen him perform.  </p>
<p>The group I was with arrived early, and Tony was at the front door, greeting people as we entered, and immediately he made a very different impression. He seemed soft, hippieish, relaxed, smiling. Later I realized this may have been the first time I'd seen him in his element. And the show, a four-piece jazz band, with his brother <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Levin">Pete Levin</a> on piano, started off playing (to my uneducated ear) pretty plain improvisational jazz. But as the show went on, I could see that this music had been composed, and had all kinds of themes running through it. It seemed to me the music had been cultivated over many years? </p>
<p>The Levins and friends, are roughly my age. I imagined they had been playing together as long as I have been making software. And I felt certain what I was seeing here were two very talented brothers, who have been performing together their whole lives, and there was something I had been trying to understand about myself, how I feel about my art, almost fifty years after I started. There is an important difference in how I do it at 68 vs how I did it when I was 22. Exactly how it is different, I'm probably too close to it to really understand, but seeing what I imagined to being something similar in two people I kind of know, that was thought-provoking.</p>
<p>To me, music is as software probably is to most people who use it. I love it, but I don't have much of an idea of how it's made. The last few years I've been reintroduced to it in a new way, <a href="http://scripting.com/2021/12/01/144612.html?title=theBeatlesWereAnInvention">thanks</a> to <a href="http://scripting.com/2022/01/25/144824.html?title=imABeatleshead">the</a> <a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/series/the-beatles-get-back/7DcWEeWVqrkE">Get Back documentary</a>, which gave us a view into the Beatles' creative process, something I wish I could have seen when I was much younger. The Beatles were the music my generation grew up with, but I never really even understood that there was a difference between a John song and a Paul song. </p>
<p>The second great influence has been Andrew Hickey's <a href="https://500songs.com/">500 songs</a> podcast. Now I have so many more stories to go with the music that my life was formed by. And I have a feeling that attending this event on Sunday will turn out to be a similar influence. </p>
<p>Now, what music should I go see next? <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">💥</span></p>
<p>PS: The concert was <a href="https://nippertown.com/2023/12/18/concert-review-the-levin-brothers-the-linda-12-16-2023/">reviewed</a> by a professional.</p>

Jason Snell: [Over] the two decades of modern macOS, Apple has addressed most of the basic needs of the average user.

## My SimpliSafe doorbell lit its own fire this winter

<p>As part of my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV-QOQE9A_4&list=PL2_OBreMn7FpmFf_nipMxvjKtz4Ch1ZgX">new studio/office buildout</a>, I needed a 'smart' doorbell, so I could accept deliveries or see who rang, even if I was far from the door or recording.</p>

<p>I bought a SimpliSafe system for my location, and tied it into Home Assistant. It was easy to set up, the monthly cost was a fraction of what ADT wanted to charge, and <em>yes</em>, I know it's wireless-only communication can be tampered with. It's like a lock—it helps keep people honest, and is only one small part of a balanced security diet.</p>

## The (semi-) automated explainer gets good

date: 2023-12-18, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

Though several of this year’s experiments in AI-generated stories ended poorly, next year, several major newsrooms will publish automated or semi-automated explainers — and they’ll be good. Explanatory journalism involves, among other things, synthesis of existing material, and that’s a skill that modern chatbots like ChatGPT and Claude excel at. They can summarize reports, answer...

## AI kills the one-size-fits-all model

date: 2023-12-18, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

In 2024, the journalism industry will be forced to reinvent the news experience. The coming year will be defined by the increasing prominence of generative AI search, which offers AI-generated summaries and responses to user inquiries in a conversational format. This will decimate search traffic for news media. In response to the risks from generative...

## The year journalism in Africa embraces its Africanness

In the fall of 1963, Kwame Nkrumah spoke to journalists at the second Conference of Africa Journalists in Accra.

## The news industry finally reckons with the political economy of journalism

date: 2023-12-18, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

In 2024, we will finally take political economy seriously. What might that augur for the future of journalism? For starters, it means moving beyond critiquing the predictable failures of hyper-capitalist media to imagining and building democratic alternatives. But first we must shift how we understand the relationships between the market, media, and democracy. American media...

It’s not like any year is free of gruesome media layoffs. But this time feels different.

## A humble Clippy for AI

One big problem with generative AI is that it&#8217;s often wrong, but always so certain it&#8217;s right.

## Bike crash 2023 part... er... 21?

date: 2023-12-18, from: Liam Proven blog

I am overdue. <br /><br />So, on Tuesday, as I said last week, I was up at 4:30 to fly to Liverpool. I saw Ms Helene Stephenson, a senior consultant there, who greeted me familiarly although I am ashamed to admit I don't remember meeting her before. <br />I got good news (for a change).<br /><br />They are happy with how it's uniting, and as soon as 1 year post-operation, they could maybe remove the plate in my wrist -- that is right under the skin, and causes me pain, which is why I've taken to wearing a towelling wristband on that wrist. I don't need to bang it; just resting on a hard surface hurts.<br /><br />I can lift heavier loads now, increasing slowly. (I was told to avoid any load over 1kg in July or so.) <br /><br />I can start swimming, and start physiotherapy to try to build up some strength and increase the rotation. I've made an appointment for January, and went for a swim on Saturday and it was OK. It felt weird but it didn't hurt.<br /><br />Regarding my loss of supination (that's the rotation in the forearm: pronation is turning the palm of your hand downwards, for example to type. I can do that. Supination is turning the palm upwards, for instance to hold a bowl of soup. Soup -&gt; supination, geddit?)<br /><br />Ms Stephenson thinks that maybe, with lots of effort, I can regain as much rotation as I had before, although no more than that. That would be a big deal. I haven't been able to turn my palm flat since the mid-1980s but not being able to hold my hand vertical, like a blade or for a kung-fu chop downwards, is a major handicap.<br /><br />It's the first positive news in 9mth, and my spirits are a little lifted.<br /><br />Then I went for a belated veggie fry-up, followed by a pint, then a visit to Pete Young and family, which was great. They've been looking after the laptop Douglas Spencer lent me in hospital, and my noise-cancelling headphones as recommended by Tomáš Brukner shortly before Ada arrived. I've really missed those!<br /><br /><img src="https://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=lproven&ditemid=309122" width="30" height="12" alt="comment count unavailable" style="vertical-align: middle;"/> comments

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2023-12-18, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

One interesting way to make our feed readers smarter about working with Mastodon and Bluesky is to do the same kind of mapping from account to feed we do with sites that support <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2011/12/17/rssAutodiscovery.html">feed discovery</a>. When we see the user is trying to subscribe to a Mastodon account, we know where its feed is, so subscribe to that. Same for Bluesky. I expect we'll do that for FeedLand via the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple/tree/main/demos/feedhunter">FeedHunter package</a>.

That's how we're doing it in <a href="https://feedland.com/">FeedLand</a>. And in case Brent reads this, the same approach works for Bluesky, which has excellent RSS 2.0 support thanks to the work done by John Spurlock. The RSS 2.0 support there has more features than Mastodon's RSS feeds, but so far is not part of the Bluesky platform (I am urging them to adopt it). Here's the <a href="https://rss.firesky.tv/?filter=from:brentsimmons.bsky.social">feed</a> for Brent's account on Bluesky, and <a href="https://rss.firesky.tv/?filter=from:scripting.com">mine</a>. RSS is a perfect format for open non-silo'd social web apps. It gives us the most interop, most quickly. They should all be getting on board the RSS bandwagon, asap, imho. It's too good an opportunity to pass up.

## On Mastodon Support in NetNewsWire

date: 2023-12-18, from: Innessential (Brint Simmons' blog)

<p>Tim Chambers, admin of the Mastodon server indieweb.social, which hosts my personal account and the NetNewsWire account, <a href="https://indieweb.social/@tchambers/111596493325633510">asked me</a> if ActivityPub support is on the roadmap for NetNewsWire. Great question!</p>

<p>Tim was responding to <a href="https://mastodon.social/@ricmac/111596432765792578">Richard MacManus</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are there any RSS Readers that are trying to integrate ActivityPub too? Pondering the glut of email newsletters in our inboxes these days, and wondering if we are due for an RSS Reader renaissance, except with a fediverse twist this time…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I hear this. It’s not the first time this has come up, and I’ve spent the past year or so thinking about it.</p>

<p>Since RSS is an open web thing that brings you stuff people write, and ActivityPub is also an open web thing that brings you stuff people write, it’s an obvious good idea to do both in the same app. Totally.</p>

<p>But the question was specifically about NetNewsWire.</p>

<p>We will make NetNewsWire work better with Mastodon-generated RSS feeds. There are some things we’re not doing yet that will make reading these a better experience.</p>

<p>But should NetNewsWire become a Mastodon client? That’s where the answer is not so obvious.</p>

<p align="center">* * *</p>

<p>Let’s compare the NetNewsWire and Mastodon experiences.</p>

<p>NetNewsWire is a three-paned RSS reader. Sidebar (accounts, folders, feeds) on the left. Timeline (titles and/or first few lines) in the middle. Article on the right. <a href="https://netnewswire.com/screenshots.html">See these screenshots</a> to get the idea.</p>

<p>Each article has a read/unread status. Selecting an article marks it as read, and there are commands to mark all as read (and mark all as read above or below the selection).</p>

<p>This is not the only good model for an RSS reader, but it’s how NetNewsWire works — and it’s a bad fit for a Mastodon reading experience.</p>

<p>Whether you use Mastodon on the web or in an app you’re used to a single timeline per account (with perhaps side streams for mentions and such). All posts from everyone you follow appear in that single timeline. You don’t deal with read/unread status — instead you have a chronological position.</p>

<p>The timeline shows the entire post (usually), instead of an optional title and first few lines. There is no third article view, because the entire post is displayed in the timeline.</p>

<p>This experience isn’t unique to Mastodon, of course — that’s how X, Threads, Micro.blog, Bluesky, and other social media apps work.</p>

<p>But it’s not how NetNewsWire works, and if we try to mash that experience into the app — but have it on only when a Mastodon account is selected — we’d end up with a confusion that feels like two very different apps. Because it would be.</p>

<p align="center">* * *</p>

<p>A second option: we could not change the experience and just assume that some people would like to use Mastodon in a NetNewsWire way instead of in the usual social media way. I’m extremely skeptical of this idea — I think it would be a pain, and I think most people who try it would drop it.</p>

<p>The third option, which I think is best, which we already do, is to support Mastodon via RSS. (Mastodon feeds are usually available as RSS — you can add <code>.rss</code> to the end of a URL to get a feed.)</p>

<p>There might be some Mastodon accounts you want to follow in your RSS reader instead of in your Mastodon client. Think of an account for a website that doesn’t have an RSS feed, but that reliably posts links to articles. Or a person you want to follow — but you don’t want to show up in their follower list. (Sounds a little antisocial, sure, but you can imagine good reasons.)</p>

<p>We can, and will, do more to make Mastodon-over-RSS a good experience in NetNewsWire. Right now we’re not picking up avatars or image attachments, which we can fix. There might be more things like that to do. We might add the ability to post to Mastodon, since it’s a natural thing to want to share stuff from your RSS reader to Mastodon.</p>

<p>But I don’t think we’ll make NetNewsWire a real Mastodon client.</p>

<p align="center">* * *</p>

<p>It still seems like RSS and Mastodon could fit in the same app, though! If I were designing it, I’d start with the social media experience: the single timeline of posts. Very simple sidebar. No article view. No read/unread status — just position in the timeline.</p>

<p>You could add RSS feeds, but they’d be treated like Mastodon posts. Any article short enough would appear in full in the timeline, but most would probably have to be truncated. You’d open articles in your browser, just like you do now with social media apps (there’d be no third article pane).</p>

<p>Such an app could be a nice unified experience. Get your Mastodon, Threads, RSS feeds, Micro.blog and, hopefully, other services — anything that supports ActivityPub, RSS, or some other open format or API — all in one place, in a way that’s already familiar to everyone.</p>

<p>Sounds pretty great! But it’s not NetNewsWire.</p>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2023-12-17, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

The last episodes of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22the+crown%22">The Crown</a> were absolute garbage. It's so bad that you notice the music and how dramatic it is for absolutely no drama on screen. I'm surprised the actors were willing to go along with it. The only good part was where the Queen does standup near the end of the last episode. Something like 80 hours of TV behind them, and all of a sudden this stoic character, with no sense of humor whatsoever, who can't even cry, is bringing down the house. Oh please. I had to stick around to see how bad it can get, now you don't. If I had to give it a rating it would be <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/12/17/ohthehumanity.png">Oh The Humanity</a>.

## FDISK 1.3.11

date: 2023-12-17, from: FreeDOS News

<div class="markdown_content"><p>The FDISK program creates and manages partitions on a hard drive. FreeDOS FDISK recently had two new maintenance releases that fixed several bugs. 1.3.10 increased compatibility with some older quirky IDE controllers and added an Italian translation. Version 1.3.11 fixed a bug where FDISK was not writing the partition table of the 8th disk. You can download the new versions from the FDISK repository <a class="" href="https://github.com/FDOS/fdisk" rel="nofollow">on GitHub</a> or more directly from the <a class="" href="https://github.com/FDOS/fdisk/releases" rel="nofollow">releases page</a>.</p></div>

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/12/17/lastDuel.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Picked a movie, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Duel_(2021_film)">The Last Duel</a>, more or less at random, based largely on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Duel_(2021_film)#Cast">who</a> was in it, and the fact that the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/13/movies/the-last-duel-review.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Gk0.YAJS.AGdcc4Vz9G0C&hpgrp=k-abar&smid=url-share">NYT</a> gave it a critic's pick rating. It was good. But this isn't a movie review, it's a review of the user interface for choosing movies on streaming services. Why can't we integrate a site like <a href="http://metacritic.com/">Metacritic</a> with Hulu, Netflix, Amazon, Max, AppleTV, et al. Just let me know what Metacritic says, and make it clickable, so I can see what the individual pubs had to say if I want more info. Don't make me look it up. People joke about how we spend our time scrolling around not watching anything. But it's true, I do it. Most of them are not worth the time, I suspect. But when you find one that's good, almost at random and even so had to do a lot of work to determine if it was worth a chance, and this has been going on for a decade, why doesn't one of these services just buy Metacritic and integrate it and make your users sing your praises everywhere online. How much could Metacritic cost? (They seem to be in trouble, a lot of the links generated by their CMS are broken.)

## LAST NIGHT I DREAMED OF HIPPOS ON THE BEACH

date: 2023-12-17, from: Howard Jacobson blog

&#8216;Why are there hippos on the beach?&#8217; I asked the lifeguard. He looked like an older Tadzio from Death in Venice, clad in striped concentration-camp pyjamas, conscious of his beauty. He answered my question with a question. &#8216;You&#8217;ve heard of liposuction?&#8217;
