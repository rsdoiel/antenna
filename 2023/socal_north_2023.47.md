<em>This post was updated on Nov. 19 at 9:35 p.m.</em>
Ninety-three yards of turf stood between the Trojans and the Bruins’ end zone.&#160;
Buried deep in his own territory, coach Lincoln Riley called for a MarShawn Lloyd rush on USC’s first offensive play of the third quarter.&#160;
But instead of a four-yard run to set up second-and-6, the ball popped out of Lloyd’s hands, landing right in front of defensive back Alex Johnson.&#160;
Eleven yards of turf stood between the redshirt senior and the Trojans’ end zone.&#160;
Johnson collected the ball and waltzed past the goal line untouched, extending UCLA football’s (7-4, 4-4 Pac-12) lead over USC (7-5, 5-4) to 18 after the Trojans’ third turnover of the day.
