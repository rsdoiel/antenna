Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0320 PM CST Tue Nov 28 2023

Valid 301200Z - 061200Z

A progressive upper-air pattern is expected through the extended
period, with a series of mid-level troughs traversing the U.S. and
corresponding surface lee troughs/surface cyclones developing over
the central Plains. While cool or moist surface conditions will
limit wildfire-spread potential over most locales, prolonged dry and
breezy conditions are expected across the central and southern High
Plains most days. At the moment, the main reasons for not adding
Critical probabilities this outlook are 1) uncertainty in fuel
receptiveness, and 2) strength of the larger-scale surface wind
field. Widespread, appreciable precipitation accumulations may not
occur across the central/southern High Plains into early next week,
suggesting that some continued drying of fuels should take place. If
guidance agreement in overlapping Elevated conditions can persist
over the next few days, lower-end Critical probabilities may be
introduced in future outlooks.

Severe thunderstorms are not expected today or tonight.

No changes are needed with the 20z update. A few lightning flashes

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1026 AM CST Tue Nov 28 2023/

...Synopsis...
A midlevel shortwave trough is moving over the Lower Great Lakes
now, and subtle veering of flow this afternoon will result in
shorter over-lake fetches and reduced depth/organization to the lake
effect snow bands.  Given the marginal thermodynamic profiles for
charge separation, the threat for isolated lightning flashes is
expected to diminish through the afternoon.  Farther west, a
midlevel low will move slowly eastward toward the central/northern
CA coast by early Wednesday.  There may be sufficient
cooling/moistening of profiles for weak buoyancy and isolated
lightning flashes near the end of the period along the coast.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0140 AM CST Tue Nov 28 2023/

...Synopsis...
A southern-stream midlevel trough will track eastward across the
Southwest, preceded by strengthening southwesterly flow and
increasing mid/high-level clouds crossing the southern Rockies. This
will promote breezy/gusty southerly return flow over portions of the
southern and central Plains. However, the increasing cloud coverage
and low-level moisture advection (albeit weak) should limit RH
reductions where the breezy winds are expected. Elsewhere across the
CONUS, cool and/or moist conditions should limit fire-weather
concerns.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1101 AM CST Tue Nov 28 2023

Valid 291200Z - 301200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered thunderstorms will develop late Wednesday into early
Thursday over much of southern and eastern Texas, and far southeast
Oklahoma. Isolated thunderstorms also are possible over parts of
Arizona and New Mexico, as well as near or just offshore from the
central California coast. Severe weather appears unlikely.

...Discussion...

A shortwave trough along the Pacific Coast will shift east toward
the Four Corners and northern Mexico on Wednesday. Ensuing height
falls across the southern High Plains vicinity will foster
increasing southerly low-level flow across TX. Strong theta-e
advection from near the surface through around 700 mb will support
increasing destabilization during the second half of the period.
Shear profiles will conditionally favor supercells overnight across
the TX coastal vicinity. However, most instability will remain
elevated from near the top of the moist layer between 850-700 mb
through 400 mb, while strong low-level inhibition prevails. This
will allow for isolated thunderstorms, but surface-based convection
is unlikely. Given a lack of stronger large-scale ascent and weak
low-level convergence, coupled with low-level inhibition, severe
potential appears low late Wednesday into early Thursday.

..Squitieri.. 11/28/2023

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0140 AM CST Tue Nov 28 2023/

...Synopsis...
On the backside of a departing large-scale trough over the
Northeast, strong deep-layer west-northwesterly flow will overspread
the Southeast. At the same time, surface high pressure will shift
east-southeastward from the Great Plains into the central Gulf
Coast. Along the eastern periphery of the surface high, an enhanced
pressure gradient will support 10-15 mph northwesterly surface winds
(with higher gusts), while shallow boundary-layer mixing into dry
air aloft favors 25-35 percent minimum RH across portions of the
Southeast and southern Appalachians. While locally elevated
fire-weather conditions are possible for these areas, recent
rainfall and generally cool surface temperatures should limit the
overall threat.

Farther west, strong northwesterly flow aloft will cross the
northern Rockies, yielding dry/breezy downslope flow into the
northern High Plains. A lack of appreciable precipitation over this
area suggests that fuels are at least modestly receptive, and
locally elevated fire-weather conditions are possible. Similar to
the Southeast, cool surface temperatures should mitigate the threat.

Valid 281300Z - 291200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected today or tonight.

...Lower Great Lakes...
In proximity to the mid-level cold core (-40C at 500 mb) centered
over eastern Ontario and Quebec, steep lapse rates persist with
lake-induced CAPE and lake effect snow in the lee of the Great
Lakes. This low-topped convection may be still conducive to a few
lightning flashes through the morning/early afternoon, particularly
in the lee of Lake Ontario.

...California coast...
A southern-stream trough will approach the California coast late
tonight and early Wednesday. Given the expected weakening nature of
the approaching surface cyclone, and its offshore forecast track,
the potential for appreciable boundary-layer destabilization inland
of northern/central coastal areas appears quite low. While mid-level
cooling ahead of the modest mid-level cold core (500 mb temperatures
around -22 to -24C) may contribute to convection capable of
lightning offshore, lightning production with the convection should
tend to wane as it approaches central California coastal areas late
tonight into early Wednesday.
