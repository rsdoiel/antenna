**@Miguel de Icaza Mastondon feed** (date: 2023-12-25, from: Miguel de Icaza Mastondon feed)

<p>Jeremy Scahill summed it up well:</p><p>Remarkable how so many defenders of Israel‚Äôs mass killing operations in Gaza sound like a Hollywood depiction of a sociopath torturing someone. ‚ÄúWe can make it all stop if Hamas puts down its weapons &amp; surrenders.‚Äù The ‚Äúit‚Äù here being the annihilation of 1,000 children a week.</p>

## Newsboat 2.34 is out

date: 2023-12-25, updated: 2023-12-25, from: Newsboat News


            <p>
                Here‚Äòs a little update to your favourite RSS/Atom reader,
                everyone¬†:)
            </p>

            <p>
                There aren‚Äòt many user-visible changes though; most of the
                effort was spent improving things internally. Dennis van der
                Schagt and bogdasar1985 continue to make progress on various
                fronts, which should eventually bring us a new key-bind system,
                help fix the long-standing issue with non-UTF-8 content in old
                cache.db files, and more.
            </p>

            <p>
                Docs also received some updates and polish. Lysander Trischler
                continues to play a vital role here, reviewing all the
                docs-related changes and helping authors improve them even
                further. Incidentally, I don‚Äòt mention any of this work in the
                changelog; should I?
            </p>

            <p>
                Hope you‚Äòll find this new release at least as good as the
                previous one. We‚Äòre already working on the next, better one¬†:)
                Merry Christmas to those who celebrate today, and a happy New
                Year!
            </p>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2023-12-25, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

I made a change to how images are served from this blog, to see if the images are still blocked by GMail. Previously we redirected to an <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/images/2022/12/01/santa.png">S3 file</a>, so we could use HTTPS and but not have to have the bits flow through one of my Digital Ocean servers, which after this change, they now do. For most of you this will be blah blah whatever blah blah zzzz, but some people may find it interesting.

This period is often a time of innovation in the world of blogs, podcasting and feeds. For me this year, I'm using the time to do more work on CSS and basic user interface stuff for <a href="https://feedland.com/">FeedLand</a> and for news products like <a href="http://news.scripting.com/">news.scripting.com</a>, which has been surprisingly popular. The new stuff will start showing up first in that site, pretty soon. The goal is to build on its popularity, to bootstrap a new platform.

<div class="markdown_content"><p>NetDrive is a DOS device driver that allows you to access a remote disk image hosted by another machine as though it was a local device with an assigned drive letter. The remote disk image can be a floppy disk image or a hard drive image. Thanks to Michael B. Brutman for add this to his already very feature packed mTCP set. However, Michael notes that the rest of mTCP hasn't changed much so he's made NetDrive available as a separate download - although newer mTCP releases should include NetDrive.

## CloudNativePG 1.22.0, 1.21.2 and 1.20.5 Released!

date: 2023-12-25, from: PostgreSQL News

<p>The <strong>CloudNativePG Community</strong> is thrilled to unveil version 1.22.0 of the
<strong>CloudNativePG Operator</strong>, a significant milestone featuring the introduction
of <strong>declarative tablespaces</strong> and <strong>temporary tablespaces</strong> alongside various
enhancements and fixes.</p>
<p>Tablespaces, a powerful and widely adopted feature in database management
systems, now take center stage in CloudNativePG 1.22.0. This release empowers
users to boost the vertical scalability of their databases by decoupling the
physical and logical data modeling, achieving optimal performance through
parallel on-disk read/write operations. With CloudNativePG, users can define
additional tablespace volumes, and also ensure they can be used for temporary
operations (CloudNativePG seamlessly manages the <code>temp_tablespaces</code> GUC).</p>
<p>This marks a pivotal step towards adopting Very Large Databases, building upon
the foundation laid by Kubernetes volume snapshots introduced in version 1.21.</p>
<p>Starting from version 1.22.0, the <code>ALTER SYSTEM</code> command is now disabled by
default. This ensures that changes to the PostgreSQL configuration are
orchestrated through the Kubernetes API. This streamlined approach guarantees
coherence across the entire high-availability cluster and aligns with best
practices for Infrastructure-as-Code.</p>
<p>In terms of security, all supported versions now require TLS 1.3 for PostgreSQL
connections by default, further bolstering the integrity of data transmission.</p>
<p>Before initiating an upgrade, carefully review the
<a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/current/installation_upgrade/#upgrading-to-1220-1212-or-1205">detailed instructions</a>.
New patch releases are now available for all supported versions, including
1.21.2 and 1.20.5.</p>
<p>Considering the notable changes introduced, we strongly recommend upgrading to
CloudNativePG 1.22.0 at your earliest convenience. Alternatively, update to the
latest patch version within your current minor release.</p>
<p>With the release of 1.22.0, the 1.20.x minor version will reach its <a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.22/supported_releases/#support-status-of-cloudnativepg-releases">end of
life</a>
on January 21, 2024.</p>
<p>This release addresses several bugs for improved stability. For a comprehensive list of changes, refer to the following release notes:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.22/release_notes/v1.22/">Release notes for 1.22.0</a></li>
<li><a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.21/release_notes/v1.21/">Release notes for 1.21.2</a></li>
<li><a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.20/release_notes/v1.20/">Release notes for 1.20.5</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you for your continued support and engagement with CloudNativePG!</p>

There are a few new features, too, however, such as a watchdog thread, enabled by default, to detect mainloop hangs, bigger task previews, an API to play sounds for notifications, a DDC option in backlight settings, and a lot more.

## Microsoft ending support for Windows 10 could send 240 mln PCs to landfills ‚Äì report

date: 2023-12-24, from: OS News

Microsoft&#8217;s plan to end support for Windows 10 operating system could result in about 240 million personal computers being disposed, potentially adding to landfill waste, Canalys Research said. The electronic waste from these PCs could weigh an estimated 480 million kilograms, equivalent to 320,000 cars. While many PCs could remain functional for years post the end of OS support, Canalys warned demand for devices without security updates could be low. ‚Ü´ Akash Sriram for Reuters A lot of these machines are perfectly capable of running Windows 11 if not for Microsoft&#8217;s artificial restrictions, and while less relevant &#8211; most people can&#8217;t just switch to Linux or BSD &#8211; there are alternative operating systems to keep these machines going. The only good thing that might come of this is a flurry of cheap, usable hardware on the second hand market, which can be used by us enthusiasts for all kinds of things.

## Console

date: 2023-12-24, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1>Console</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to get used to <code>sway</code> as my window manager. Recently I realized that my <code>dmenu</code> wouldn&rsquo;t list games like <code>openarena</code>. No surprise there: <code>/usr/games/bin</code> is not part of <code>PATH</code> and so it doesn&rsquo;t get shown. I wondered how to get it there, and then I found that many people log in from the Linux console without a session manager or display manager. That is, they login from the console, get a login shell, and that shell then starts the window manager.</p>

<p>This is what I see on the first virtual console:</p>

<pre><code>Debian GNU/Linux 12 melanobombus tty1

login: _
</code></pre>

<p>If I log in, <code>fish</code> starts and one of the startup files it executes is <code>.config/fish/conf.d/sway.fish</code> which starts <code>sway</code> but only when logging in from <code>tty1</code>. You can switch between the consoles using Alt-F1 to Alt-F6. Once <code>sway</code> runs, you can switch back to the remaining virtual consoles using Ctrl Alt F2 to Ctrl Alt F6.</p>

<pre><code># If running from tty1 start sway
set TTY1 (tty)
[ &quot;$TTY1&quot; = &quot;/dev/tty1&quot; ] &amp;&amp; exec sway
</code></pre>

<p>Since this script uses <code>exec</code>, <code>sway</code> replaces <code>fish</code>. No big deal. But I still get to setup PATH.</p>

<p>So now I was staring at the login prompt of the console‚Ä¶ and I don&rsquo;t know about you, but I could use a larger font!</p>

<p>I tried to go the <code>console-setup</code> route but that doesn&rsquo;t help:</p>

<pre><code>sudo dpkg-reconfigure console-setup
</code></pre>

<p>This allows me to change the console font.</p>

<p>And once my script runs, I can repeat that:</p>

<pre><code>setupcon
</code></pre>

<p>But at that point I&rsquo;m already logged in!</p>

<p>In theory, there&rsquo;s a systemd service that is supposed to handle it:</p>

<pre><code>$ systemctl status console-setup
‚óè console-setup.service - Set console font and keymap
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/console-setup.service; enabled; preset: enabled)
     Active: active (exited) since Sat 2023-12-23 14:45:03 CET; 18min ago
    Process: 496 ExecStart=/lib/console-setup/console-setup.sh (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
   Main PID: 496 (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
        CPU: 3ms
</code></pre>

<p>And yet‚Ä¶ it does not! Why is that? Examining <code>/lib/systemd/system/console-setup.service</code> I find that it runs <code>/lib/console-setup/console-setup.sh</code> and that does some complicated stuff to try and determine whether to run <code>setupcon</code> or not. I guess in my case doesn&rsquo;t?</p>

<p>Oh well, there&rsquo;s always the option of using kernel parameters!</p>

<p>I created a one line file called <code>/etc/default/grub.d/font.cfg</code> to set a console font. This way the default setting in <code>/etc/default/grub</code> is overwritten, too. No more <code>quiet splash</code>! I like to see the output scroll by as the system boots.</p>

<pre><code>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=&quot;fbcon=font:TER16x32&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>To activate it:</p>

<pre><code>sudo dpkg-reconfigure grub2
</code></pre>

<p>Rebooting the system, I noticed that things still didn&rsquo;t seem to work for the <code>initramfs</code> which ends up asking me for the password to decrypt my disk. So what I needed was to get the new config into the <code>initramfs</code>, too.</p>

<p>Based on the current kernel I&rsquo;m running:</p>

<pre><code>sudo dpkg-reconfigure linux-image-6.1.0-15-amd64
</code></pre>

<p>I think it works, now!</p>

## Human-Scale vs Asymmetric Social Media

date: 2023-12-24, from: Pointers gone wild blog

Every once in a while, I see people mention &#8220;dark patterns&#8221; in UI design. Patterns that are actively trying to deceive users, either to maximize engagement, to click some ad, or to get them to perform an action they didn&#8217;t want to perform. An obvious example would be some huge pop-up ad which can be [&#8230;]
