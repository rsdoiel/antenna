Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1115 AM CST Wed Nov 08 2023

Valid 091200Z - 101200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated thunderstorms are possible from central/southern Arkansas
and northern Louisiana into southern/eastern Texas on Thursday.

...Synopsis...
On Thursday, an upper low will deepen as it moves from near Lake
Superior into southern Quebec, with intensifying mid and high level
winds across the Northeast. Behind this feature, modest southwest
flow aloft will extend into the southern Plains and northern Mexico,
with subtle embedded disturbances.

At the surface, the primary feature of interest will be an elongated
cold front which will interact with mid to upper 60s F dewpoints
from the lower MS Valley into central and eastern TX. This front
will push toward the TX Coast by Friday morning, with a small warm
sector remaining from near Houston eastward along the northern Gulf
coast at 12Z Friday.

...Southern and eastern TX into southwest AR...
MUCAPE on the order of 500 J/kg should develop both north of the
front in an elevated sense and ahead of it into southern TX where
dewpoints will be higher. Weak warm advection atop the boundary as
well as increased differential divergence near the right entrance
region of the intensifying upper jet should support scattered
convection centered over the Arklatex during the day. Temperatures
aloft will not be particularly cool, suggesting only non-severe
storms.

To the south into TX and ahead of the cold front, heating will lead
to surface-based parcels and isolated storms. Low-level winds will
remain weak, and temperatures aloft relatively warm. As such, severe
storms are not anticipated.

Elsewhere, a strong cold front will approach the coastal Pacific
Northwest late in the day, and minimal CAPE values could support
isolated lightning flashes with shallow convection along the WA
Coast after 03Z.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1023 AM CST Wed Nov 08 2023

Valid 081630Z - 091200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected through tonight.

A strong mid-level jet max is tracking east-northeastward across the
central Plains.  An associated deepening surface low will move
across IL and into the Great Lakes region.  Low-level warm advection
to the northeast of the surface low will lead to scattered
precipitation and a few thunderstorms this afternoon and evening. 
Organized severe storms are not expected in this region.

Other isolated showers are expected this evening over parts of TX as
a weak subtropical system begins to interact with a quasi-stationary
boundary.  A few lightning flashes are possible, but the overall
risk appears to be less than 10%.

..Weinman.. 11/08/2023

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0157 AM CST Wed Nov 08 2023/

...Synopsis...
As a mid-level trough moves east across the Southwest, surface high
pressure is arriving in its wake. This surface high is over Oregon
this morning and will settle into the Great Basin by this
afternoon/evening. This will set up offshore Santa Ana winds across
southern California during the day today with some assistance from
surface heating and deeper mixing bringing stronger winds to the
surface. Therefore, as the boundary layer cools, expect some
weakening of winds. However, as high pressure reintensifies across
the Great Basin amid cooling overnight temperatures, expect the
gradient to intensify again Thursday morning with strong offshore
flow developing, particularly in Ventura county. 

Some Elevated to locally critical conditions may be possible across
parts of the Southwest today. However, these conditions appear
somewhat transient and may not last long enough to warrant an
Elevated delineation.

Tropical Storm Pilar Discussion Number  33
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP192023
200 PM MST Sun Nov 05 2023
 
Just after the issuance of the previous advisory, Pilar's center
popped out from beneath the convective overcast and is now located
at least 150 n mi to the southwest of an ongoing cluster of deep
convection.  Subjective Dvorak CI numbers from TAFB and SAB are now
down to 2.0/30 kt and 2.5/35 kt, respectively, and objective
estimates have fallen to between 35-40 kt.  Based on these data,
Pilar's initial intensity is lowered to 35 kt.  Strengthening
westerly to southwesterly shear is already taking its toll on
Pilar, and atmospheric conditions are only expected to become more
hostile over the next few days.  The NHC intensity forecast is near
the low end of the guidance, most closely following the SHIPS,
LGEM, and GFS solutions, and shows Pilar becoming a remnant low by
36 hours.  Since the storm remains over warm waters around 29
degrees Celsius, the forecast allows for the possibility of
convective redevelopment near the center tonight or on Monday.  But
if this does not occur, Pilar could become post-tropical as early
as tonight.  The remnant low is forecast to dissipate in about 3
days.
 
With the center becoming more apparent earlier this morning, it's
clear that a westward motion has continued (now estimated to be
275/9 kt).  The dynamical models are not handling Pilar's current
motion well at all since nearly all of them show an immediate
northwestward turn, and as a result, the NHC track forecast is
along the left side of the guidance envelope and leans toward the
shallow Trajectory and Beta model (TABS), especially in the short
term.  This new prediction is significantly west of the previous
forecast due to the adjusted initial position, and accounting for
Pilar's recent motion.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0149 PM CST Sun Nov 05 2023

Valid 052000Z - 061200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS COASTAL
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND OREGON...

...SUMMARY...
A brief tornado or two, isolated damaging winds, and small hail will
be possible into tonight over parts of western Oregon and the far
northern California coast.

...20z Update...

No changes have been made to the Marginal (level 1 of 5) risk area
along the Pacific Northwest coast. See discussion below for forecast
details.

Otherwise, the 10 percent general thunderstorm area has been removed
from the eastern Dakotas and MN. Thunderstorm chances appear most
likely near the end of the period further east across northeast
WI/northern Lake Michigan. Deeper moisture and greater, though still
modest, instability will be in place ahead of the eastward
progressing surface low, supporting a few lightning flashes.

..Leitman.. 11/05/2023

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1023 AM CST Sun Nov 05 2023/

...Western OR and far northern CA coast...
Minor expansion of the level 1 risk with this outlook as a
long-duration, low-probability tornado/wind threat remains apparent
beginning around midday. Observational imagery depicts a series of
embedded shortwave troughs moving generally eastward towards the
Pacific Northwest coast today into tonight, with relatively prolific
lightning production amid several convective clusters. A feed of
conditionally unstable low to mid-level lapse rates and meager
buoyancy (200-300 J/kg SBCAPE) will favor low-topped convection and
occasional lightning flashes over land this afternoon into tonight
as the waves progress inland. Low to mid-level wind profiles will
strengthen somewhat, yielding sufficient hodograph length and
low-level curvature for a few low-topped supercells. These cells
will be capable of producing a brief tornado or two, isolated strong
gusts, and small hail up to nickel size. The longest duration threat
should exist along the coast, mainly in OR with a gradual north to
south shift towards far northern CA tonight. The eastern extent of
the low-probability severe threat into parts of the Willamette
Valley should be confined from mid-afternoon to early evening.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1116 AM CST Sun Nov 05 2023

Valid 061200Z - 071200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast (see below) remains on track. In addition, a
continuation of strong westerly/downslope flow across the central
Rockies will favor lee troughing over the adjacent High Plains. As a
result, locally dry/breezy conditions are expected over parts of
eastern NM into the TX South Plains and the I-25 corridor in
southern CO. While fine fuels will continue to dry out today, the
overall fire-weather risk appears too localized for Elevated
highlights at this time.

..Weinman.. 11/05/2023

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0157 AM CDT Sun Nov 05 2023/

...Synopsis...
As a strong mid-level jet continues to drift south through the day
on Monday, some dry and breezy conditions are expected to develop
across Nevada. Dry conditions are expected across much of the
Southwest. However, winds remain light in this region which should
alleviate most fire weather concerns. There may be some increase in
initial attack across Nevada, but due to currently moist fuels, no
large fires are anticipated.  Elsewhere, dry conditions are expected
from the Southeast into the Carolinas. However, the new large fire
threat should remain minimal due to light winds.

Tropical Storm Pilar Discussion Number  32
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP192023
800 AM MST Sun Nov 05 2023
 
Pilar's cloud pattern has degraded a bit this morning, and a recent
SSMIS microwave image shows that mid-level circulation and deep
convection have decoupled to the northeast of the low-level center.
Still, the initial intensity remains 45 kt, possibly generously, 
based on the latest Dvorak CI numbers and objective satellite 
estimates.  Although deep-layer shear is diagnosed in the SHIPS 
model as being low, global model analyses suggest that stronger 
mid-level southwesterly shear is occurring beneath the outflow 
level.  Therefore, some gradual weakening is likely over the next 
day or so.  After 24 hours, deeper-layer shear begins to increase to 
the east of a trough, which should cause Pilar to weaken faster 
through midweek.  The cyclone is forecast to lose organized 
convection and degenerate into a remnant low in about 2 days, and 
then dissipate into a trough by day 4.
 
Pilar has slowed down and turned west-northwestward with an initial
motion of 285/7 kt in response to a mid-level trough extending 
southwest of the Baja California peninsula.  The storm is forecast 
to turn toward the northwest in about 24 hours as it approaches the 
trough, and continue on that heading until it dissipates in about 4 
days.  The NHC track forecast is close to the previous prediction 
and lies between the HCCA and TVCE consensus aids.
