Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1109 AM CST Thu Nov 09 2023

Valid 101200Z - 111200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated thunderstorms are possible Friday from southern and coastal
Texas toward the northern Gulf Coast.

...Synopsis...
An upper low over southern Quebec will weaken as becomes an open
wave across the Maritimes, with a broad area of cyclonic flow
extending westward across the Great Lakes. Meanwhile, modest
west/southwest flow aloft will remain from the southern Plains into
the Southeast. Weaker midlevel waves will move across the Rockies,
with one over NM and another over MT/WY.

At the surface, a large area of high pressure will be centered over
the Plains, with offshore winds into the western and northern Gulf
of Mexico. However, a weak surface trough will stretch roughly from
far southern LA/MS into the Carolinas where another front will be
moving in from the north. 

The presence of weak instability may yield a few lightning flashes
near the northern Gulf Coast, in a zone of weak low-level warm
advection, and over parts of southern and coastal TX where weak
elevated instability will remain. Severe weather is unlikely in
either case.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1018 AM CST Thu Nov 09 2023

Valid 091700Z - 101200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF VENTURA AND LOS
ANGELES COUNTIES...

The previous forecast (see below) remains on track, and no changes
were made with this update. Latest surface observations depict
dry/breezy conditions ongoing across parts of Ventura and Los
Angeles Counties, with gusts upwards of 40-50 mph amid 10-15 percent
RH over the wind-prone mountains and valleys. These dry/windy
conditions should persist into the afternoon hours, before the winds
decrease substantially during the late afternoon/early evening time
frame.

..Weinman.. 11/09/2023

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0200 AM CST Thu Nov 09 2023/

...Synopsis...
Within the last 6 hours, Critical fire weather conditions have been
observed at 6 observation sites across southern California. The
LAX/TPH gradient is currently -9.3 at 06Z , down from a peak of
-10.5 at 03Z. Expect this gradient to maintain into the morning
hours before starting to relax by late morning. Expect Elevated fire
weather concerns to wane by this evening as the gradient continues
to weaken. 

Some dry and breezy conditions are expected across the northern
Plains/Upper Midwest this afternoon, but fuels remain moist in this
region and therefore, no fire weather highlights are necessary.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1010 AM CST Thu Nov 09 2023

Valid 091630Z - 101200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
A few thunderstorms are possible through tonight from the ArkLaTex
into south Texas, and across southwest New Mexico.

...Synopsis...

Isolated to widely scattered thunderstorms will continue across
portions of southeast OK and the ArkLaTex vicinity in a warm
advection regime atop a surface cold front. Additional thunderstorms
are expected further south into central and southern TX ahead of the
southward-advancing cold front. A moist boundary-layer is in place
ahead of the front, with dewpoints generally in the mid-60s F to
near 70 F. Along with diurnal heating, this will contribute to
modest instability. However, warm midlevel temperatures will limit
stronger destabilization and preclude severe potential.

Additional isolated thunderstorms are possible across southwest NM
and vicinity this evening into tonight. The western extent of the
surface cold front moving south across TX will back into this area
and stall, while the main upper shortwave trough develops east from
the southwestern deserts. Cooling aloft will result in steepening
midlevel lapse rates and weak destabilization, supporting a few
lightning flashes.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0652 AM CST Thu Nov 09 2023

Valid 091300Z - 101200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
A few thunderstorms are possible through tonight from the Ark-La-Tex
into south Texas, and across southwest New Mexico.

...Ark-La-Tex to south TX through tonight...
In the wake of a northern stream shortwave trough over the Upper
Great Lakes, a surface cold front will continue to move slowly
southeastward into the Ark-La-Miss and to the TX coast by the end of
the period.  Aloft, a weak southern stream shortwave trough will
move east-northeastward from Sonora toward TX.  Boundary-layer
dewpoints range from the low-mid 60s in the Ark-La-Tex to the low
70s across south TX, beneath lingering steep midlevel lapse rates of
7-8 C/km.  Temperatures above the 500 mb level are relatively warm
and will tend to limit the depth/magnitude of buoyancy, while lapse
rates will be reduced by gradual moistening/ascent along the cold
front and atop the frontal surface.  Thus, a few thunderstorms will
be possible through tonight along the front, but relatively weak
buoyancy and vertical shear will limit the potential for severe
storms.

...Elsewhere...
A modest increase in low-level moisture along a backdoor front and
the approach of the midlevel trough from Sonora could support
isolated thunderstorms across southwest NM and vicinity from later
this afternoon into early tonight.  A deamplifying midlevel
shortwave trough and associated cold front will progress inland over
WA by early tonight.  Buoyancy will be minimal along the frontal
band and quite shallow/weak in the post-frontal airmass, so
thunderstorm chances appear too low for an outlook area.

Tropical Storm Pilar Discussion Number  33
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP192023
200 PM MST Sun Nov 05 2023
 
Just after the issuance of the previous advisory, Pilar's center
popped out from beneath the convective overcast and is now located
at least 150 n mi to the southwest of an ongoing cluster of deep
convection.  Subjective Dvorak CI numbers from TAFB and SAB are now
down to 2.0/30 kt and 2.5/35 kt, respectively, and objective
estimates have fallen to between 35-40 kt.  Based on these data,
Pilar's initial intensity is lowered to 35 kt.  Strengthening
westerly to southwesterly shear is already taking its toll on
Pilar, and atmospheric conditions are only expected to become more
hostile over the next few days.  The NHC intensity forecast is near
the low end of the guidance, most closely following the SHIPS,
LGEM, and GFS solutions, and shows Pilar becoming a remnant low by
36 hours.  Since the storm remains over warm waters around 29
degrees Celsius, the forecast allows for the possibility of
convective redevelopment near the center tonight or on Monday.  But
if this does not occur, Pilar could become post-tropical as early
as tonight.  The remnant low is forecast to dissipate in about 3
days.
 
With the center becoming more apparent earlier this morning, it's
clear that a westward motion has continued (now estimated to be
275/9 kt).  The dynamical models are not handling Pilar's current
motion well at all since nearly all of them show an immediate
northwestward turn, and as a result, the NHC track forecast is
along the left side of the guidance envelope and leans toward the
shallow Trajectory and Beta model (TABS), especially in the short
term.  This new prediction is significantly west of the previous
forecast due to the adjusted initial position, and accounting for
Pilar's recent motion.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0149 PM CST Sun Nov 05 2023

Valid 052000Z - 061200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS COASTAL
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND OREGON...

...SUMMARY...
A brief tornado or two, isolated damaging winds, and small hail will
be possible into tonight over parts of western Oregon and the far
northern California coast.

...20z Update...

No changes have been made to the Marginal (level 1 of 5) risk area
along the Pacific Northwest coast. See discussion below for forecast
details.

Otherwise, the 10 percent general thunderstorm area has been removed
from the eastern Dakotas and MN. Thunderstorm chances appear most
likely near the end of the period further east across northeast
WI/northern Lake Michigan. Deeper moisture and greater, though still
modest, instability will be in place ahead of the eastward
progressing surface low, supporting a few lightning flashes.

..Leitman.. 11/05/2023

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1023 AM CST Sun Nov 05 2023/

...Western OR and far northern CA coast...
Minor expansion of the level 1 risk with this outlook as a
long-duration, low-probability tornado/wind threat remains apparent
beginning around midday. Observational imagery depicts a series of
embedded shortwave troughs moving generally eastward towards the
Pacific Northwest coast today into tonight, with relatively prolific
lightning production amid several convective clusters. A feed of
conditionally unstable low to mid-level lapse rates and meager
buoyancy (200-300 J/kg SBCAPE) will favor low-topped convection and
occasional lightning flashes over land this afternoon into tonight
as the waves progress inland. Low to mid-level wind profiles will
strengthen somewhat, yielding sufficient hodograph length and
low-level curvature for a few low-topped supercells. These cells
will be capable of producing a brief tornado or two, isolated strong
gusts, and small hail up to nickel size. The longest duration threat
should exist along the coast, mainly in OR with a gradual north to
south shift towards far northern CA tonight. The eastern extent of
the low-probability severe threat into parts of the Willamette
Valley should be confined from mid-afternoon to early evening.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1116 AM CST Sun Nov 05 2023

Valid 061200Z - 071200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast (see below) remains on track. In addition, a
continuation of strong westerly/downslope flow across the central
Rockies will favor lee troughing over the adjacent High Plains. As a
result, locally dry/breezy conditions are expected over parts of
eastern NM into the TX South Plains and the I-25 corridor in
southern CO. While fine fuels will continue to dry out today, the
overall fire-weather risk appears too localized for Elevated
highlights at this time.

..Weinman.. 11/05/2023

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0157 AM CDT Sun Nov 05 2023/

...Synopsis...
As a strong mid-level jet continues to drift south through the day
on Monday, some dry and breezy conditions are expected to develop
across Nevada. Dry conditions are expected across much of the
Southwest. However, winds remain light in this region which should
alleviate most fire weather concerns. There may be some increase in
initial attack across Nevada, but due to currently moist fuels, no
large fires are anticipated.  Elsewhere, dry conditions are expected
from the Southeast into the Carolinas. However, the new large fire
threat should remain minimal due to light winds.

Tropical Storm Pilar Discussion Number  32
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP192023
800 AM MST Sun Nov 05 2023
 
Pilar's cloud pattern has degraded a bit this morning, and a recent
SSMIS microwave image shows that mid-level circulation and deep
convection have decoupled to the northeast of the low-level center.
Still, the initial intensity remains 45 kt, possibly generously, 
based on the latest Dvorak CI numbers and objective satellite 
estimates.  Although deep-layer shear is diagnosed in the SHIPS 
model as being low, global model analyses suggest that stronger 
mid-level southwesterly shear is occurring beneath the outflow 
level.  Therefore, some gradual weakening is likely over the next 
day or so.  After 24 hours, deeper-layer shear begins to increase to 
the east of a trough, which should cause Pilar to weaken faster 
through midweek.  The cyclone is forecast to lose organized 
convection and degenerate into a remnant low in about 2 days, and 
then dissipate into a trough by day 4.
 
Pilar has slowed down and turned west-northwestward with an initial
motion of 285/7 kt in response to a mid-level trough extending 
southwest of the Baja California peninsula.  The storm is forecast 
to turn toward the northwest in about 24 hours as it approaches the 
trough, and continue on that heading until it dissipates in about 4 
days.  The NHC track forecast is close to the previous prediction 
and lies between the HCCA and TVCE consensus aids.
