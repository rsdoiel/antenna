Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0944 AM CST Fri Nov 10 2023

Valid 101700Z - 111200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The current D1 Fire Weather Outlook remains on track with no updates
needed. See previous discussion below.

..Thornton.. 11/10/2023

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0101 AM CST Fri Nov 10 2023/

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns are expected to remain limited for today. Weak
lee troughing across the High Plains may support areas of dry and
breezy conditions, but the potential for meteorological conditions
maintaining elevated wind/RH thresholds appears low. Offshore flow
may persist during the morning and early afternoon hours across the
southern CA coast, but elevated wind/RH conditions are expected to
remain fairly localized to the higher, typically wind-prone,
terrain.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0924 AM CST Fri Nov 10 2023

Valid 101630Z - 111200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated lightning flashes will be possible along parts of the Gulf
coast, far west Texas/southern New Mexico, and the Olympic Peninsula
of Washington.

...Synopsis...
Mainly zonal flow aloft will overspread the CONUS, with mid-level
troughs overspreading the Southwest and impinging on the Pacific
Northwest through today. Surface high pressure and associated cooler
air will reinforce static stability across most of the CONUS,
limiting thunderstorm potential. A few lightning flashes remain
possible over southern NM/Far West TX for a few more hours, before
mid-level trough de-amplification reduces the thunderstorm threat.
Otherwise, a few flashes remains possible for the remainder of the
Day 1 period over parts of the Gulf Coast, given weak moisture
advection atop a southward-sagging cold front. Finally, a few
lightning flashes may occur across far northwest WA with the
approach of a mid-level trough.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook RESENT 1
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0847 AM CST Fri Nov 10 2023

Valid 131200Z - 181200Z

...DISCUSSION...
...Monday/Day 4 to Wednesday/Day 6...
An upper-level trough is forecast to move from the middle Rio Grande
Valley on Monday to the Lower Mississippi Valley on Tuesday, and to
the eastern Gulf Coast states by Wednesday. A moist airmass is
forecast to advect northward into the central Gulf Coast ahead of
the approaching trough. Increasing low-level flow across the western
Gulf of Mexico Monday will make conditions favorable for MCS
development. The MCS will likely move eastward across the northern
Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday. Surface dewpoints could reach the lower
to mid 60s F across the central Gulf Coast just ahead of the trough
during the day. The northern part of the MCS could first affect
southeastern Louisiana on Tuesday, and then move across far southern
Mississippi, far southern Alabama and the Florida Panhandle Tuesday
night. Wednesday, thunderstorms may develop across parts of the
Florida Peninsula. Although a severe weather threat can not be ruled
out, the models have some variance concerning the quality of
low-level moisture ahead of the system. If the more aggressive
solutions pan out, then a marginal tornado threat would be possible
on Tuesday across the central Gulf Coast. The current thinking is
that the higher quality low-level moisture and more significant part
of the MCS will remain offshore, keeping any severe threat over the
water.

...Thursday/Day 7 and Friday/Day 8...
An upper-level trough is forecast to develop across the central U.S.
on Thursday, and move into the eastern U.S. on Friday. The shortwave
trough in the Southeast is forecast to move eastward into the
western Atlantic. In the wake of this system, instability is
forecast to be limited across the Gulf Coast states and along the
Atlantic Seaboard, minimizing any potential for thunderstorm
development.

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated thunderstorms will be possible along the lower Texas coast
on Sunday, but no severe threat is expected.

...DISCUSSION...
At mid-levels, a ridge will move into the Rockies on Sunday as
northwest flow remains over much for the central U.S. A moist
airmass will be in place across the Gulf of Mexico. At the western
edge of the moist airmass, isolated weakly-forced thunderstorms will
be possible along the lower Texas coast. No severe threat is
expected across the continental U.S. on Sunday and Sunday night.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0841 AM CST Fri Nov 10 2023

Valid 101300Z - 111200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated lightning flashes will be possible along parts of the Gulf
coast, far west Texas/southwest New Mexico, and the Olympic
Peninsula of Washington.

...Synopsis...
A slow-moving front along the northwest/north central Gulf coast may
focus isolated thunderstorm development through the period.  Any
convection will be generally along and to the cool side of the
surface front, where weak buoyancy aloft may be sufficient for
charge separation and isolated lightning flashes.  Farther west,
isolated thunderstorms have been observed early this morning across
southwest NM and far west TX.  Weak elevated CAPE and ascent
downstream from a southern stream shortwave trough could support a
few additional thunderstorms the first half of the day, before the
threat ends during the afternoon.

Otherwise, isolated low-topped thunderstorms will be possible the
last few hours of the forecast period across the Olympic Peninsula
as a pronounced shortwave trough approaches coastal WA and Vancouver
by 08-12z.  Isolated lightning flashes earlier this morning near the
WV/VA border have ended and no additional thunderstorm development
is expected today.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1109 AM CST Thu Nov 09 2023

Valid 101200Z - 111200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated thunderstorms are possible Friday from southern and coastal
Texas toward the northern Gulf Coast.

...Synopsis...
An upper low over southern Quebec will weaken as becomes an open
wave across the Maritimes, with a broad area of cyclonic flow
extending westward across the Great Lakes. Meanwhile, modest
west/southwest flow aloft will remain from the southern Plains into
the Southeast. Weaker midlevel waves will move across the Rockies,
with one over NM and another over MT/WY.

At the surface, a large area of high pressure will be centered over
the Plains, with offshore winds into the western and northern Gulf
of Mexico. However, a weak surface trough will stretch roughly from
far southern LA/MS into the Carolinas where another front will be
moving in from the north. 

The presence of weak instability may yield a few lightning flashes
near the northern Gulf Coast, in a zone of weak low-level warm
advection, and over parts of southern and coastal TX where weak
elevated instability will remain. Severe weather is unlikely in
either case.

Tropical Storm Pilar Discussion Number  33
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP192023
200 PM MST Sun Nov 05 2023
 
Just after the issuance of the previous advisory, Pilar's center
popped out from beneath the convective overcast and is now located
at least 150 n mi to the southwest of an ongoing cluster of deep
convection.  Subjective Dvorak CI numbers from TAFB and SAB are now
down to 2.0/30 kt and 2.5/35 kt, respectively, and objective
estimates have fallen to between 35-40 kt.  Based on these data,
Pilar's initial intensity is lowered to 35 kt.  Strengthening
westerly to southwesterly shear is already taking its toll on
Pilar, and atmospheric conditions are only expected to become more
hostile over the next few days.  The NHC intensity forecast is near
the low end of the guidance, most closely following the SHIPS,
LGEM, and GFS solutions, and shows Pilar becoming a remnant low by
36 hours.  Since the storm remains over warm waters around 29
degrees Celsius, the forecast allows for the possibility of
convective redevelopment near the center tonight or on Monday.  But
if this does not occur, Pilar could become post-tropical as early
as tonight.  The remnant low is forecast to dissipate in about 3
days.
 
With the center becoming more apparent earlier this morning, it's
clear that a westward motion has continued (now estimated to be
275/9 kt).  The dynamical models are not handling Pilar's current
motion well at all since nearly all of them show an immediate
northwestward turn, and as a result, the NHC track forecast is
along the left side of the guidance envelope and leans toward the
shallow Trajectory and Beta model (TABS), especially in the short
term.  This new prediction is significantly west of the previous
forecast due to the adjusted initial position, and accounting for
Pilar's recent motion.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0149 PM CST Sun Nov 05 2023

Valid 052000Z - 061200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS COASTAL
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND OREGON...

...SUMMARY...
A brief tornado or two, isolated damaging winds, and small hail will
be possible into tonight over parts of western Oregon and the far
northern California coast.

...20z Update...

No changes have been made to the Marginal (level 1 of 5) risk area
along the Pacific Northwest coast. See discussion below for forecast
details.

Otherwise, the 10 percent general thunderstorm area has been removed
from the eastern Dakotas and MN. Thunderstorm chances appear most
likely near the end of the period further east across northeast
WI/northern Lake Michigan. Deeper moisture and greater, though still
modest, instability will be in place ahead of the eastward
progressing surface low, supporting a few lightning flashes.

..Leitman.. 11/05/2023

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1023 AM CST Sun Nov 05 2023/

...Western OR and far northern CA coast...
Minor expansion of the level 1 risk with this outlook as a
long-duration, low-probability tornado/wind threat remains apparent
beginning around midday. Observational imagery depicts a series of
embedded shortwave troughs moving generally eastward towards the
Pacific Northwest coast today into tonight, with relatively prolific
lightning production amid several convective clusters. A feed of
conditionally unstable low to mid-level lapse rates and meager
buoyancy (200-300 J/kg SBCAPE) will favor low-topped convection and
occasional lightning flashes over land this afternoon into tonight
as the waves progress inland. Low to mid-level wind profiles will
strengthen somewhat, yielding sufficient hodograph length and
low-level curvature for a few low-topped supercells. These cells
will be capable of producing a brief tornado or two, isolated strong
gusts, and small hail up to nickel size. The longest duration threat
should exist along the coast, mainly in OR with a gradual north to
south shift towards far northern CA tonight. The eastern extent of
the low-probability severe threat into parts of the Willamette
Valley should be confined from mid-afternoon to early evening.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1116 AM CST Sun Nov 05 2023

Valid 061200Z - 071200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast (see below) remains on track. In addition, a
continuation of strong westerly/downslope flow across the central
Rockies will favor lee troughing over the adjacent High Plains. As a
result, locally dry/breezy conditions are expected over parts of
eastern NM into the TX South Plains and the I-25 corridor in
southern CO. While fine fuels will continue to dry out today, the
overall fire-weather risk appears too localized for Elevated
highlights at this time.

..Weinman.. 11/05/2023

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0157 AM CDT Sun Nov 05 2023/

...Synopsis...
As a strong mid-level jet continues to drift south through the day
on Monday, some dry and breezy conditions are expected to develop
across Nevada. Dry conditions are expected across much of the
Southwest. However, winds remain light in this region which should
alleviate most fire weather concerns. There may be some increase in
initial attack across Nevada, but due to currently moist fuels, no
large fires are anticipated.  Elsewhere, dry conditions are expected
from the Southeast into the Carolinas. However, the new large fire
threat should remain minimal due to light winds.

Tropical Storm Pilar Discussion Number  32
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP192023
800 AM MST Sun Nov 05 2023
 
Pilar's cloud pattern has degraded a bit this morning, and a recent
SSMIS microwave image shows that mid-level circulation and deep
convection have decoupled to the northeast of the low-level center.
Still, the initial intensity remains 45 kt, possibly generously, 
based on the latest Dvorak CI numbers and objective satellite 
estimates.  Although deep-layer shear is diagnosed in the SHIPS 
model as being low, global model analyses suggest that stronger 
mid-level southwesterly shear is occurring beneath the outflow 
level.  Therefore, some gradual weakening is likely over the next 
day or so.  After 24 hours, deeper-layer shear begins to increase to 
the east of a trough, which should cause Pilar to weaken faster 
through midweek.  The cyclone is forecast to lose organized 
convection and degenerate into a remnant low in about 2 days, and 
then dissipate into a trough by day 4.
 
Pilar has slowed down and turned west-northwestward with an initial
motion of 285/7 kt in response to a mid-level trough extending 
southwest of the Baja California peninsula.  The storm is forecast 
to turn toward the northwest in about 24 hours as it approaches the 
trough, and continue on that heading until it dissipates in about 4 
days.  The NHC track forecast is close to the previous prediction 
and lies between the HCCA and TVCE consensus aids.
