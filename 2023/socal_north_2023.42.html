<p>It’s the beginning of term, and the new frosh class are met with
their first challenge of the year: attempting to socialize with random
upperclass students. Each night for their first week at Caltech they
rotate, attending events from all the houses, trying to find the perfect
fit for their four years at Caltech. Then comes the cannon fire, and
rotation comes to an end. The end of rotation brings every frosh a new
housing assignment they have to move into. A very exhausting day follows
as frosh move across campus, the dread of the boat problem and the first
week of sets lingering overhead all the while.</p>

<p>A common concern heard among the undergraduates on registration day
these past few terms is “there aren’t enough hums!”. Broadly referring
to all Humanities and Social Science (HSS) courses offered in a given
term by the word ‘hum’, what specifically does the statement mean? That
there aren’t enough advanced humanities courses being offered in any
given term (i.e. not enough_ total <em>HSS courses)? That there isn’t
enough breadth of courses to satisfy their interests (i.e. not
enough</em> “interesting”_ HSS courses for any given student)? That
there aren’t enough courses that fit into their schedule (i.e. not
enough HSS courses <em>at a given time</em>)? The Academics and Research
Committee (ARC) has compiled the following data to understand the source
of the concern.</p>

<p>At the start of 2023, students began to hear rumors of major
renovations coming to Braun Athletic Center and Scott Brown Gym. We
heard that the distribution of gym equipment would be changing, that the
athletic training office would be moving, and circulating most of all,
that the locker rooms were to see major renovations. For students and
members, athletes and otherwise, this was an exciting change. The locker
rooms had been outdated for a long time, both in their facilities and
the ideas they reflected, and in April 2023, this much needed change
began.</p>

Unstandardization of Caltech: Bathrooms</h2>
<p>date: 2023-10-17, from: California Tech (Caltech Student
Newspaper)</p>
<p>After arriving at Caltech, one of the first things I noticed about
the campus once I finally had time to wander around was that, from what
I could tell, this place lacked a consistent architectural style.
There’s a mix of Spanish-style architecture like Beckman Institute, more
modern-looking buildings like Chen, and silly guys like the Beckman Hall
(and also ugly ass ones like Downs-Lauritsen). This mixing of styles
continues inside, with some buildings like Bridge keeping their
old-fashioned style but Gates-Thomas deciding to modernize. That’s all
neat and cool, but it goes a little further than what you see walking up
and down the halls. The place I noticed these tiny details is a sacred
place where you have time to yourself, a place free of distraction, a
place of relief: the bathroom.</p>

<p>On Friday, September 29, 2023, the Caltech Graduate Students and
Postdocs United (C/GPU) hosted a rally to celebrate reaching a majority
of signed union authorization cards. For those unfamiliar or just
confused about the process, this was not a vote. Those in charge of the
union effort made it clear that according to their recorded numbers,
enough graduate students and postdocs currently support moving forward
to a vote to force the issue. These same leaders have also been very
vocal about the fact that a vote would not have needed to be forced if
the administration had simply consented early on to let us hold one.</p>
