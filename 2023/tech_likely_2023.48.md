## Amazon’s Thin Client: Wrong Idea, Wrong Time. Here’s Why.

date: 2023-11-27, from: Om Malik blog

…we have a generation that is growing up with modern computing interfaces. Instead, we are still pushing the “classic” models onto them. Why? If computing has to become modern, then we have to use modern models for everything.&#160; That’s me in May 2021. Amazon, according to the internet, is launching a $195 thin client computer that allows &#8230;

## Schatzkarten

date: 2023-11-27, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1>Schatzkarten</h1>

<p>Schatzkarten als Teil der Schätze sind wichtig, weil sie kleine Aufgaben darstellen. Wenn das Ziel in der Nähe ist, sei es im Nachbarhex bei der Reise Überland oder in einem Raum in der Nähe im Megadungeon, der Effekt ist immer gleich.</p>

<p>Die Spielerinnen und Spieler freuen sich! Das ist das wichtigste.</p>

<p>Es ist eine Ablenkung von was auch immer Spielerinnen und Spieler sonst vor haben. Ablenkung ist für mich eine wichtige Herausforderung im Spiel. Wie sehr will ich als Spieler etwas? Wenn ich mich ständig ablenken lasse, dann war es mir vielleicht eben doch nicht so wichtig.</p>

<p>Es ist eine Einladung, ein grösseres Risiko einzugehen. Meistens zeigt die Schatzkarte ja in das unbekannte Gebiet. Haben wir noch genug Trefferpunkte, Zaubersprüche und andere Ressourcen? Wollen wir es wagen?</p>

<p>Deswegen dürfen Schatzkarten nicht auf Schätze verweisen, die zu weit weg sind oder die erst in einem halben dutzend Spielabenden erreicht werden können. Zudem sind Schatzkarten ja eine Belohnung, deswegen sollten die Fundorte nicht nochmal speziell geschützt sein, denn sonst wäre der Schatz ja den neuen Wächtern zuzurechnen. Nein, falls es am Ort neue Wächter hat, dann haben diese ebenfalls Schätze.</p>

<p>Soviel zur Vorrede. Für <a href="Horte">Horte</a> habe ich im Moment folgende Liste:</p>

<ol>
<li>Karte zu einem Grab einer verarmten Adligen oder eines verarmten Adligen: dort hat es einen Ring mit einem Edelstein</li>
<li>Karte zu einem Grab einer Adelsfamilie: 1 Juwel und 3W6 Edelsteine</li>
<li>Karte zu einem Versteck von Herrschaftszeichen: 1W6 Juwelen (Krone, Zepter, Ringe, Halskette, Armreif, Kelch)</li>
<li>Karte zu einem Versteck von Devotionalien: 1W6 Juwelen (Statuen, Miniaturen, Kelche, Schüsseln, Ikonen, heilige Schriften)</li>
<li>Karte zu einem Versteck von Geflohenen: 1W6×1000 Gold</li>
<li>Karte zu einem Versteck für den Notfall: 2W6 Edelsteine, 2W6×10 Gold</li>
<li>Karte zu einer Schatztruhe: 1W6×1000 Silber, 1W6×1000 Gold, 1W6 Juwelen</li>
<li>Karte zu einer Truhe mit Heeressold: 2W6×1000 Silber, 2W6×1000 Gold</li>
<li>Karte zu einem verlorenen Schrein: Statue im Wert von 1W6×1000 Gold</li>
<li>Karte zu einem verlorenen Tempel: 1W6 Statuen im Wert von je 1W6×1000 Gold</li>
<li>Karte zum Grab einer alten Heldin mit einer Waffe (S. 27).</li>
<li>Karte zum Grab eines alten Helden mit einer Waffe (S. 27).</li>
<li>Karte zum Grab einer alten Heldin mit einer Rüstung (S. 28).</li>
<li>Karte zum Grab eines alten Helden mit einer Rüstung (S. 28).</li>
<li>Karte zum Grab einer alten Magierin mit einem Ring (S. 29).</li>
<li>Karte zum Grab eines alten Magiers mit einem Ring (S. 29).</li>
<li>Karte zum Grab eines alten Magiers mit einem Zauberstab (S. 29).</li>
<li>Karte zum Grab einer alten Magierin mit einem Zauberstab (S. 29).</li>
<li>Karte zu einem alten Beschwörungszirkel mit dem Namen eines Dämons, z.B. eines Krakendämons (S. 35).</li>
<li>Karte zu einem alten Portal in eine andere Welt (S. 36).</li>
</ol>

<p>Jetzt brauche ich noch eine Namensliste für die Begrabenen…</p>

<p>Die Portale in andere Welten beziehen sich natürlich auf die <a href="2023-11-21-kosmologie">Kosmologie</a>. Die <a href="2023-11-18-magische-waffen">magischen Waffen</a> wurden auch schon besprochen.</p>

## Super tiny Windows 11 OS gets a big update: Tiny11 2311 shrinks 20% and allows cumulative updates

date: 2023-11-27, from: OS News

NTDEV, the developer behind Tiny11, has released a new update for its miniature Windows 11 operating system, called Tiny11 2311, that adds Microsoft&#8217;s latest feature update, 23H2, into the OS and introduces a plethora of bug fixes addressing issues in the outgoing version of Tiny11. On top of this, the new update also shrinks Tiny11&#8217;s install size by a whopping 20%, making Tiny11&#8217;s renowned footprint even smaller. There is absolutely no need for Windows 11 to be as big and invasive as it is, and it feels like such a shame and missed opportunity to burden an otherwise good and capable operating system with such cruft and useless junk.

## Human connection

date: 2023-11-26, from: Manu - I write blog

<p>In a <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/on-creating-beautiful-things">recent post</a> I mentioned that I am a <em>sucker for signed books and limited editions</em>. The reason for that has nothing to do with the uniqueness of a signed object or its potential extra monetary value. Those are all aspects that have no meaning to me. The reason why I love signed books it’s the same reason why I love handmade objects: the human connection. Knowing that someone picked up that book and took a second to open it up and sign it adds that extra something that makes my brain happy.</p>
<p>And in a world that’s more and more digital and artificial, I think these small human touches are going to become increasingly more valuable.</p>

## How Apple’s developers reflashed Mac ROMs in the ’90s

date: 2023-11-26, from: OS News

After I wrote about the possibility of programmable Mac ROM SIMMs in Quadras a couple of months ago, I suspected that there had been a way for developers at Apple in the 68k Mac era to reflash the ROM in their Macs during development, just like BIOS updates on PCs. The reason I believed this is because the ROM SIMM socket in the Quadras brought out pins for 12V (VPP) and write enable (/WE). I had verified that the write enable pin was going into the memory controller chip in several Mac models, so I was pretty confident that in-system programming was possible. As luck would have it, multiple people pointed out to me that an Apple internal utility used for ROM flashing had been uploaded to the Macintosh Garden. It was recovered from a prototype PowerBook 520 purchased in 2020. Of course, I had to download this utility and figure out how it works. I honestly cannot believe it&#8217;s taken this long for such a tool to become available one way or the other. Classic Macs are incredibly popular in the retro community, and being able to reflash the ROMs like this is incredibly useful. It took some work and disassembly, but Doug Brown got it working.

## Debian’s MIPS64EL CPU port is at risk due to declining hardware access

date: 2023-11-26, from: OS News

Debian&#8217;s MIPS64EL that is a 64-bit little endian port using the N64 ABI is at risk due to declining access for building the Debian 64-bit MIPS packages. MIPS64EL is now being treated as an &#8220;out of sync&#8221; architecture due to lacking sufficient build daemon resources for timely building new packages and if the situation doesn&#8217;t improve, it may not be suitable as a release architecture for Debian 13 &#8220;Trixie&#8221;. Not all architectures last forever, and as time goes on, more and more of these once promising architectures will simply no longer be part of the modern Linux world. It makes sense &#8211; but it&#8217;s still sad.

## A quick look back at Microsoft’s first sports video game: Microsoft Olympic Decathlon

Ironically, the second commercial game that Microsoft published, after Microsoft Adventure in 1979, was an attempt at a sports game sim. It was called Microsoft Olympic Decathlon, and like Microsoft Adventure, it was first launched as a TRS-80 PC game, this time in 1980. Microsoft has so many unexpected products in its long history.

I loved the way it looked on my desktop system, but then I tried it on my iPad, and realized it didn't work. Not enough horizonal real estate to pull it off. So I went back to the tabs-across-the-top format. I had to drop one of the tabs, and not use the nice Font-Awesome icons I used previously on Scripting News when there was <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/11/26/currentScriptingHome.png">plenty of room</a>. The page is entirely assembled when you load it, so it only works with JavaScript turned on.

<a href="https://colinwalker.blog/blog/?date=2023-11-26#p1">Colin Walker wonders</a> if he should try <a href="https://bsky.app/">Bluesky</a>. I say yes. At first I was pretty negative, after the implosion of Twitter, here was another <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Dorsey">Jack Dorsey</a> network. I wasn't in the mood. But eventually I tried it, and I liked it very much. The mood is civil and often artistic. There are some very creative people there. And I think the API, while it's <a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/892d671e-1dc9-4ffc-9101-cadbca842adc">inscrutable</a> to me, is understandable to developers who put their minds to it, and I expect Colin is one who will figure it out. And I don't think there's any hope of ActivityPub, it's far too underspecified, and interop is likely to be product-based, not based on the protocol, where the Bluesky protocol appears to be overly-well-thought-out, or maybe the docs could have more examples. I didn't have the time to dive into it when I looked.

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/11/26/oppenheimer.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Watched <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/oppenheimer/">Oppenheimer</a> last night. Very good movie. I like the artistic flourishes, reminds me of another movie I watched recently and liked, a lot, <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/spencer/">Spencer</a>. I wasn't really interested in the life and death of Lady Di, but I also got through the latest episodes of The Crown, which I had resisted when the newest Queen was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crown_(season_5)">introduced</a>. I find it hard to make the adjustment to new actors playing the roles of characters I had come to love, esp <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claire_Foy">Claire Foy</a> as young Queen Elizabeth, a fantastic actress who played in one of the most spectacular dramatic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBwQICiGRmw">scenes</a> anywhere anytime. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crown_(season_6)">latest episodes</a> of The Crown were about Diana mostly, and were fantastic. Back to Oppenheimer. I'll try not to spoil it too much, but the drama is puzzling, why are they going after Oppenheimer when he miraculously put together the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Project">Manhattan Project</a> which created, in a race with Germany and the USSR, the bomb that ended World War II. The final scene, a flashback to an earlier scene where we didn't hear the dialog, between Oppenheimer and his colleague at Princeton, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein">Albert Einstein</a>, about what happens when you create something that changes the direction of humanity. What happens is this -- they push you aside. I'm not comparing myself to these two giants, but I have had the same question about how tech reacted to my contributions. My conclusion was that our culture has reason to erase the accomplishments of outliers. We prefer innovation to come in nice predictable packages, with a PR person on top, and when that's disturbed, we close ranks to make it all appear very ordinary. Anyway, all of this is very good holiday entertainment and thought provoking. My next adventure in video is <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/tv/pachinko/">Pachinko</a> on Apple TV, which is somewhat confusing, but keeps me coming back, it's so compelling. I still have the last seasons of <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/tv/ted-lasso/">Ted Lasso</a> and <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/tv/reservation-dogs/">Reservation Dogs</a> in the queue. And of course there's a new season of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fargo_(season_5)">Fargo</a>, which I'm sure I'll love. Right now my plan is to wait for the series to end and watch it all in a binge.

## “you have hacked into my devices”

date: 2023-11-26, from: Daniel Stenberg Blog

I&#8217;ve shown you email examples many times before. Today I received this. I don&#8217;t know this person. Clearly a troubled individual. I suspect she found my name and address somewhere and then managed to put me somewhere in the middle of the conspiracy against her. The entire mail is written in a single paragraph and &#8230; <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2023/11/26/you-have-hacked-into-my-devices/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">&#8220;you have hacked into my devices&#8221;</span> <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>
