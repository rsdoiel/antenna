<h2 id="spying-through-push-notifications">Spying through Push
Notifications</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-07, updated: 2023-12-06, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
When you get a push notification on your Apple or Google phone, those
notifications go through Apple and Google servers. Which means that
those companies can spy on them—either for their own reasons or in
response to government demands.
</p>
<p>
Sen. Wyden is trying to
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/governments-spying-apple-google-users-through-push-notifications-us-senator-2023-12-06/">get
to the bottom of this</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
In a statement, Apple said that Wyden’s letter gave them the opening
they needed to share more details with the public about how governments
monitored push notifications.
</p>
<p>
“In this case, the federal government prohibited us from sharing any
information,” the company said in a statement. “Now that this method has
become public we are updating our transparency reporting to detail these
kinds of requests.”…

<blockquote>
<p>
This paper discusses the protocol used for electing the Doge of Venice
between 1268 and the end of the Republic in 1797. We will show that it
has some useful properties that in addition to being interesting in
themselves, also suggest that its fundamental design principle is worth
investigating for application to leader election protocols in computer
science. For example, it gives some opportunities to minorities while
ensuring that more popular candidates are more likely to win, and offers
some resistance to corruption of voters…

<p>date: 2023-12-06, from: Om Malik blog</p>
<p>After shying away from “AI” for a few years, Apple has finally
started to tout the “AI” capabilities of its computers. Good riddance,
for I have been fairly critical of their apathy towards this move
towards “augmented intelligence.” It all started with the recently
announced M3 MacBooks. The star of the new chip is the GPU, with a new

<h2 id="ai-and-mass-spying">AI and Mass Spying</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-05, updated: 2023-12-05, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Spying and surveillance are different but related things. If I hired a
private detective to spy on you, that detective could hide a bug in your
home or car, tap your phone, and listen to what you said. At the end, I
would get a report of all the conversations you had and the contents of
those conversations. If I hired that same private detective to put you
under surveillance, I would get a different report: where you went, whom
you talked to, what you purchased, what you did.
</p>
<p>
Before the internet, putting someone under surveillance was expensive
and time-consuming. You had to manually follow someone around, noting
where they went, whom they talked to, what they purchased, what they
did, and what they read. That world is forever gone. Our phones track
our locations. Credit cards track our purchases. Apps track whom we talk
to, and e-readers know what we read. Computers collect data about what
we’re doing on them, and as both storage and processing have become
cheaper, that data is increasingly saved and used. What was manual and
individual has become bulk and mass. Surveillance has …

I trusted a lot today. I trusted my phone to wake me on time. I trusted
Uber to arrange a taxi for me, and the driver to get me to the airport
safely. I trusted thousands of other drivers on the road not to ram my
car on the way. At the airport, I trusted ticket agents and maintenance
engineers and everyone else who keeps airlines operating. And the pilot
of the plane I flew in. And thousands of other people at the airport and
on the plane, any of which could have attacked me. And all the people
that prepared and served my breakfast, and the entire food supply
chain—any of them could have poisoned me. When I landed here, I trusted
thousands more people: at the airport, on the road, in this building, in
this room. And that was all before 10:30 this morning…
