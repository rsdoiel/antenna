Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0647 PM CST Tue Dec 12 2023

Valid 130100Z - 131200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated thunderstorms will be possible this evening into tonight
across parts of the southern High Plains.

...DISCUSSION...
An upper-level trough will move across the Desert Southwest this
evening, as southwesterly mid-level flow remains over the southern
Rockies and southern High Plains. A 40 to 50 knot low-level jet will
strengthen across west Texas. Lift associated with the low-level
jet, along with large-scale ascent ahead of the approaching system,
will make isolated thunderstorm development possible late this
evening into tonight. No severe threat is forecast, and
thunderstorms are not expected over the remainder of the continental
U.S. through tonight.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0228 PM CST Tue Dec 12 2023

Valid 141200Z - 201200Z

Fire weather potential continues to appear limited for the duration
of the extended period. Recent surface observations show a
strengthening surface high over the central Plains. This feature
will continue to amplify over the coming day as it migrates into the
eastern third of the country. Latest water-vapor imagery also
depicts an upper disturbance drifting southeast from the Great Basin
into the Four Corners region. This feature will introduce widespread
rain chances across the southern High Plains to the Southeast over
the mid to late week period. The combination of weak winds in
proximity to the surface high and cool/wet conditions should limit
most fire weather concerns.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0154 PM CST Tue Dec 12 2023

Valid 122000Z - 131200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
The risk of thunderstorms appears negligible across much of the U.S.
through daybreak Wednesday.

...20Z Update...
Forecast soundings suggest that moistening supportive of very weak
CAPE across the Texas South Plains vicinity tonight will be largely
rooted near or above 700 mb.  The extent of any potential for warm
advection driven convection to produce lightning remains unclear.
However, the categorical thunderstorm line (10 percent probability)
has been adjusted somewhat, to focus where latest model output
suggests that weak mid-level ascent and slightly cooler mid-level
temperatures might contribute to thermodynamic profiles most
conducive to lightning.

..Kerr.. 12/12/2023

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1013 AM CST Tue Dec 12 2023/

...Synopsis...

No changes to the ongoing outlook are needed with the 1630z update.
Moistening midlevels and steepening lapse rates ahead of the western
U.S. upper trough will foster modest elevated instability overnight
across eastern NM/west TX. Increasing ascent in a continued warm
advection regime may be sufficient for a few lightning flashes in
elevated convective showers. Severe storms are not expected.

## SPC Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1243 PM CST Tue Dec 12 2023

Valid 131200Z - 141200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast remains on track with minimal fire weather
potential expected over most of the CONUS for Wednesday. Details in
the previous discussion (below) outlining concerns for southern
California remain valid based on recent observations and trends in
recent guidance.

..Moore.. 12/12/2023

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0150 AM CST Tue Dec 12 2023/

...Synopsis...
A cutoff low in the lower Colorado River Valley will shift into the
Four Corners and become more of an open wave on Wednesday. With a
strong trough exiting the Northeast by the end of the period,
surface high pressure will intensify in the East with some
maintenance of high pressure within the Great Basin. Cool
temperatures and light winds over the driest fuels will again
preclude fire weather concerns for most of the CONUS. Offshore flow
will continue across southern California, though a slow weakening
trend will occur through the period. RH early in the day, when the
winds will be strongest, will not likely fall below critical
thresholds. A couple hours of elevated fire weather does appear
possible by early/mid afternoon. Fuels have dried further at lower
elevations. However, the limited spatial extent and short duration
of these conditions should keep fire weather concerns localized.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1126 AM CST Tue Dec 12 2023

Valid 131200Z - 141200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
The risk for severe thunderstorms appears negligible across the
U.S., Wednesday through Wednesday night.

...Synopsis...
Cool, generally dry and stable air prevails, particularly under the
influence of expansive surface ridging across the northern U.S.
Intermountain West through most areas east of the Rockies.  An
increasingly prominent embedded center of higher pressure within
this regime is forecast to gradually shift across the middle
Mississippi through lower Ohio Valleys during this period, beneath
confluent flow in the wake of a mid-level short wave trough digging
across the Great Lakes and northern Mid Atlantic region.  However,
models indicate that the southern/southwestern periphery of this
ridging will be maintained across much of the northern Gulf of
Mexico and southern Great Plains, beneath the leading edge of
large-scale mid-level ridging, which will continue to spread inland
of the Pacific coast through much of the Mississippi Valley.

Weak mid-level troughing, within the larger-scale ridge, is forecast
to slowly pivot across the Intermountain West and Rockies, with an
embedded mid-level low digging into the Mogollon Rim vicinity of the
Southwest, before slowly turning eastward toward the southern
Rockies by late Wednesday night.

...Four Corners region into southern Great Plains...
Elevated moisture return and lift associated with warm advection, in
advance of the developing mid-level low, may contribute to
sufficient destabilization to support increasing convection across
parts of the Texas South Plains into Panhandle region by 12Z
Wednesday.  Some of this may become capable of producing lightning,
before at least some further destabilization, beneath increasingly
divergent mid/upper flow, contributes to a more substantive increase
in weak thunderstorm development near/east of the New Mexico Sangre
de Cristo Mountains by late Wednesday afternoon, then into the Texas
Panhandle and South Plains vicinity through 12Z Thursday.  

Closer to the cold core of the mid-level low, models indicate that
weak boundary-layer destabilization is possible across the plateau
and Mogollon Rim vicinity of eastern Arizona into adjacent western
New Mexico by late Wednesday afternoon.  Aided by strengthening
mid/upper forcing for ascent, this may lead to increasing
thunderstorm development which may persist into mid/late evening. 
While the risk for severe storms appears negligible, thermodynamic
profiles might still become conducive to small hail/graupel in
stronger convection.

...Southern Florida...
While northeasterly to east-northeasterly low-level flow is likely
to be maintained through the period, models indicate that low-level
moistening might contribute to sufficient destabilization to support
occasional weak thunderstorm activity, mainly where low-level
convergence remains enhanced near/offshore of southeast coastal
areas.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0951 AM CST Tue Dec 12 2023

Valid 121700Z - 131200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast remains on track with limited fire weather
potential. Localized elevated fire weather conditions remain
possible along the southern CA coast later tonight, but latest
guidance continues to suggest low potential for widespread concerns
due to marginal RH reductions.

..Moore.. 12/12/2023

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0144 AM CST Tue Dec 12 2023/

...Synopsis...
Surface high pressure will be the dominant feature across much of
the CONUS today. Stronger upper-level winds will be relegated to the
Upper Midwest and Northeast due to a strong cyclone in eastern
Canada. Cooler temperatures and light winds over dry fuels will keep
fire weather minimal for most areas. Some increase in offshore winds
will be possible in southern California. RH recovery overnight will
likely be enough to mitigate fire weather concerns as winds increase
late tonight.

...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms are not expected in the U.S. through tonight.

...Synopsis/Discussion...
In mid/upper levels, cyclonic flow will remain over the East, but
will lose amplitude in response to two processes:
1.  The eastward ejection of a substantial trough now over the Lower
Great Lakes and Mid-Atlantic region.  The associated low-level cold
front is in the process of clearing the New England Coast, with the
surface-based buoyancy well south of the area, and another couple
hours of 100-300 J/kg MUCAPE largely confined to between the top of
a stable boundary layer and the -20 deg C thermal level.  While a
rogue flash cannot be ruled out around Cape Cod, lightning potential
appears too low and isolated to introduce a general-thunder area. 
2.  Amplification and slow eastward shift of initially weak
troughing now over the Pacific Coast vicinity, reaching interior
OR/western ID, northwestern NV, and east-central/southwestern CA by
the end of the period.  Associated strengthening DCVA/cooling aloft
should remain too displaced from enough elevated moisture to support
a thunderstorm area until day 2.
