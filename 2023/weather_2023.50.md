Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0629 AM CST Mon Dec 11 2023

Valid 111300Z - 121200Z

...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms are not expected in the U.S. through tonight.

...Synopsis/Discussion...
In mid/upper levels, cyclonic flow will remain over the East, but
will lose amplitude in response to two processes:
1.  The eastward ejection of a substantial trough now over the Lower
Great Lakes and Mid-Atlantic region.  The associated low-level cold
front is in the process of clearing the New England Coast, with the
surface-based buoyancy well south of the area, and another couple
hours of 100-300 J/kg MUCAPE largely confined to between the top of
a stable boundary layer and the -20 deg C thermal level.  While a
rogue flash cannot be ruled out around Cape Cod, lightning potential
appears too low and isolated to introduce a general-thunder area. 
2.  Amplification and slow eastward shift of initially weak
troughing now over the Pacific Coast vicinity, reaching interior
OR/western ID, northwestern NV, and east-central/southwestern CA by
the end of the period.  Associated strengthening DCVA/cooling aloft
should remain too displaced from enough elevated moisture to support
a thunderstorm area until day 2.

## SPC Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook

date: 2023-12-11, from: NOAA Weather Forecasts

<br /><a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/fire_wx/fwdy2.html"><img src="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/fire_wx/day2fireotlk.gif" border="1" alt="Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook Image" hspace="1" vspace="1" width="815" height="555" align="center" /></a><pre>
Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1254 AM CST Mon Dec 11 2023

Valid 121200Z - 131200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
An upper-level cyclone will be positioned across parts of the
Northeast with a cutoff low developing in the Great Basin in a
quasi-Rex Block pattern. Surface high pressure will continue to be
the predominant feature over much of the CONUS. Fire weather
concerns will likely remain minimal on Tuesday for most areas.
Offshore pressure gradients in southern California will increase
very late Tuesday into Wednesday morning. However, RH recovery
overnight and only marginal increases in the wind should keep fire
weather concerns low through the end of the period.
