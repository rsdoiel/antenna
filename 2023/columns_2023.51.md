## What do French artists, Wright Brothers & AI have in common?

date: 2023-12-17, from: Om Malik blog

By drawing inspiration from Isaac Asimov and employing my "present future" framework, I delve into the power of envisioning the future, beginning with the futuristic visions of French artists at the turn of the 20th century. Our collective history of progress and innovation as a species provides a solid foundation for optimism about the future of technology and AI.
