## How Can We Remain Steady?

date: 2023-12-19, from: Dan Rather's Steady

Fury. Confusion. Despair. A year may be ending, but those who cherish American democracy look over the horizon at 2024 with a strong sense of foreboding. A former president strides, seemingly unstoppable and with authoritarian glee, toward the Republican nomination for president.

## OpenAI Is Not Training on Your Dropbox Documents—Today

date: 2023-12-19, updated: 2023-12-18, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>There&#8217;s a rumor flying around the Internet that OpenAI is training foundation models on your Dropbox documents.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/13/how-to-stop-dropbox-from-sharing-your-personal-files-with-openai.html">CNBC</a>. Here&#8217;s <a href="https://boingboing.net/2023/12/14/dropbox-is-sharing-users-files-with-openai-heres-how-to-opt-out.html">Boing Boing</a>. Some articles are <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/12/dropbox-spooks-users-by-sending-data-to-openai-for-ai-search-features/">more nuanced</a>, but there&#8217;s still a <a href="https://www.computing.co.uk/news/4157118/dropbox-backlash-openai-sharing">lot</a> <a href="https://www.thestack.technology/dropbox-openai-ai-toggle-werner-privacy/">of</a> <a href="https://tech.co/news/stop-dropbox-sharing-data-openai">confusion</a>.</p>
<p>It seems not to be true. Dropbox isn&#8217;t sharing all of your documents with OpenAI. But here&#8217;s the problem: we don&#8217;t trust OpenAI. We don&#8217;t trust tech corporations. And&#8212;to be fair&#8212;corporations in general. We have no reason to.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;OpenAI are training on every piece of data they see, even when they say they aren’t&#8221; is the new &#8220;Facebook are showing you ads based on overhearing everything you say through your phone’s microphone.&#8221;...</p></blockquote>

## A santa themed CODE100 puzzle – Hitting the chimney

date: 2023-12-19, from: Chris Heilmann's blog

I just finished another puzzle for the CODE100 competition and thought I make it Santa themed. Imagine Santa cocking things up by dropping his presents everywhere but inside the chimney.

## Implications of the failure of the Adobe-Figma deal.

date: 2023-12-18, from: Om Malik blog

Adobe and Figma have mutually agreed to terminate their previously announced $20 billion merger agreement due to anticipated difficulties in receiving necessary regulatory approvals from the European Commission and the UK Competition and Markets Authority. The decision ends the potential acquisition of Figma by Adobe, announced in September 2022. Both companies will continue to operate &#8230;

## What do French artists, Wright Brothers & AI have in common?

date: 2023-12-17, from: Om Malik blog

The 120th anniversary of the Wright brothers' first flight serves as a good reminder to reflect on the long arc of technology and its impact. By drawing inspiration from Isaac Asimov and employing my "present future" framework, I delve into the power of envisioning the future, beginning with the futuristic visions of French artists at the turn of the 20th century. Our collective history of progress and innovation as a species provides a solid foundation for optimism about the future of technology and AI.
