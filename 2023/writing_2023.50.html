“It really comes down to scene work. Do these characters pop? Is this
fun to read? Is it fun to imagine what’s going to happen next? When you
get to the end of that pilot do you want to find out what’s going to
happen in the next episode? It’s all of that,” says Graham Yost,
showrunner for <em>Silo </em>on AppleTV+.
</p>
<p>
You may not know the name Graham Yost, but you certainly know his TV
shows: <em>Justified, The Americans, Slow Horses, Sneaky Pete, From the
Earth to the Moon, </em>and<em> Band of Brothers</em> just to name a few
– he also wrote the blockbuster film <em>Speed</em> in 1994.
</p>
<p>
On today’s episode, I chat with Graham about his show <em>Silo</em> on
AppleTV+ which is a startling apocalyptic thriller that’s been renewed
for a second season. It stars Rebecca Ferguson, David Oyelowo, Common
and Tim Robbins. We talk about the lessons he learned making
<em>Speed</em>, which show impacted his writing the most and if a new
season of <em>Justified</em> – that includes Boyd Crowder (Walton
Goggins), will be coming back to television.
</p>
<p>
Graham also shares his advice for emerging writers. “The big thing I say
to writers who are starting out is, ‘What are you working on next?’ If
they only have that one project, well, you need more. You need to find
out what you’re good at. That’s the job. We’re paid to write,” he says.

I have always loved short stories. I don’t remember a time when I
‘‘discovered’’ them. For me, there was nothing to find. They were always
there; in school textbooks, homework assignments, in the anthologies I
would randomly pick off the shelf at the library. There was never any
question either of what I would start writ­ing when I decided to learn
story craft. In those early days, reaching the end

<p>
Daniel Kraus’s <strong>Whalefall </strong>straddles the line between
science and science fiction and pulls readers into a world that is at
once familiar and completely alien. As full of action and gore as it is
packed with science and emotional turmoil, <strong>Whalefall </strong>is
a superb reimagining of Jo­nah’s tale as well as a narrative that cements

<h2 id="how-to-find-experts-to-help-you-fact-check-your-novel">How to
Find Experts to Help You Fact-Check Your Novel</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-13, from: Literature &amp; a Latte blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;In a previous article, we looked at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/how-to-find-beta-readers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;how you can find and work with beta readers&lt;/a&gt;; people who read your manuscript and give you comments on the plot, characterization, dialog, and more. Writing is a lonely task, and it&amp;rsquo;s important to find people you can trust to share their opinions on your work. For the most part, these beta readers can give you general feedback about a novel. But they can&amp;rsquo;t help you with more specific elements that require specialist knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
When you’re writing about a specific profession or time period, you get
everything right. If you make mistakes, it’s likely that many if not
most readers won’t notice it, but you’ll certainly hear from those who
are familiar with a certain subject or profession who will gleefully
correct you.
</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;figure class=&quot;article__image&quot;&gt;
                
                    &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.literatureandlatte.com/assets/image/blog/article/expertsjpg.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;  /&gt;
                
                                &lt;/figure&gt;
        
    






            &lt;p&gt;Many writers of crime fiction befriend police officers and use them as sounding boards to ensure that the descriptions of police activities in their books are correct. If you write science fiction, you may want to find beta readers who can critique the use and description of science in your novel, real or imagined. And if you write a historical novel, it can be helpful to get a real historian, who is familiar with your setting, to give your manuscript a once over.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
There are many books written for writers describing police procedures,
forensics, and legal processes, and there are books about certain
historical periods for writers. But let’s say you’re writing a novel
where air traffic controllers are important to the story. It may not be
easy to find the kind of documentation that you need that explains how
they work. Or what if you’re writing a romance novel set on a cruise
ship? You may have taken cruises, and you may know enough about how it
feels to be a guest on one of those ships, but it can be useful to know
what goes on behind the scenes, because this could help you create
interesting plot points, or introduce characters from the crew.
</p>
<p>
You should check everything that you can on your own, using reference
books and online tools, on your novel during the final editing stage.
Start by going through your manuscript or draft and highlighting the
elements that need to be checked. You may need to check things like
place names or the descriptions of specific places, and these can all be
found using tools like Google Maps. To ensure that you’ve described real
places correctly, you can use Google Street View, which lets you see
exactly what many locations look like, allowing you to provide detailed
descriptions without taking trips to do research.
</p>
<p>
For other types of fact-checking, there are many resources available
online. You can look up specific topics in academic journals and
authoritative websites related to specific subjects, and Wikipedia is
quite good as well. (But don’t blindly trust what you read there; follow
the sources cited, and make sure they are reliable.)
</p>
<p>
Depending on the subject you’re dealing with, it may be enough to do
some online research, as long as you don’t go into too much detail. When
you have more than you can find, you can try reaching out to experts in
the fields you discuss. You can find people like this through
professional networks, social media platforms, or online forums, and you
may even find some in writing communities such as Goodreads; there are
lots of writers who have expertise from their careers and who would be
willing to share. In some cases, you may only have a few questions, and
these can be answered quickly.
</p>
<p>
Where things can get more complicated are not so much the facts but the
way people work, or the way specific objects work. For example, there is
a very popular writer of thrillers who spends pages and pages talking
about the guns used, yet who has been criticized for not understanding
how specific guns work. This doesn’t bother most readers, but people who
know about guns end up distrusting this author. A bit of research, and
the help of an expert, might have avoided disdain from people familiar
with guns.
</p>
<p>
Fact-checking can take a certain amount of time, even for experts. When
you contact someone, explain the premise of your novel and the specific
information you need to verify. Provide a brief summary of your story
and explain what you would like them to review. In many cases, you may
just want a few facts to be checked, but some novels may require more
attention, and this may be difficult for busy professionals. But some
experts might be avid readers, and relish the idea of helping out an
author.
</p>
<p>
When you’ve found someone willing to help you, send them excerpts or
sections from your novel that you want vetted. Highlight specific
statements, events, or details that you want them to review, so they can
focus on the areas that need attention. In some cases, it won’t take
long for an expert to look over a few dozen sentences and confirm
whether you got things right or not. But sometimes, checking the
behavior of people as they do a specific type of work, throughout a
novel, requires a more thorough read.
</p>
<p>
It’s important to provide a reasonable timeframe to review your queries.
Remember that these professionals are often busy and may not be able to
read a manuscript as quickly as you need, so it’s important to agree to
a schedule. One suggestion is to find experts in the field you need
fact-checked who are retired, and who may have more time.
</p>
<p>
There’s lots to do when finishing up a novel, and fact-checking may not
be high on your task list. But it’s an important element of the final
editing process, and getting facts wrong can annoy the readers who spot
mistakes.

team currently relies on volunteers, with the idea that many hands make
light work; on the editorial side, we have Aleksandra Hill as the

<p>
I’ll kick things off with the August issue of Zooscape, which focuses on
furry specula­tive fiction. So it makes sense that the issue lingers on
the deep wounds that exist within and between animals, including humans.
From extinctions and apocalypses to quieter hurts and the kindnesses
that heal them, Zooscape once more shows the versatility of furry
speculative fiction,

This story was updated 12/13/23.

<p>
Author Cait Corrain’s 2024 debut novel <strong>Crown of Starlight
</strong>was removed from Del Rey’s schedule today after Corrain was
accused of creating numerous fake Goodreads accounts for the purpose of
leaving negative reviews for other authors on the popular site.
Corrain’s agent, Rebecca Podos of Rees Literary Agency, has also cut
ties with the writer.

The “review bombing” was publicized last week by author Xiran

<p>
<strong>The Fractured Dark </strong>is the second novel in Megan E.
O’Keefe’s Devoured Worlds trilogy. The first book, <strong>The Blighted
Stars</strong>, is a fast-paced and viciously readable planetary opera
adventure with intelligent fungus, AI descending into dysfunc­tion,
ecological critique, explosions, banter, and a touch of inadvisable
romance to make the whole cocktail go down more
