<p>One big problem with generative AI is that it’s often wrong, but
always so certain it’s right. At the very instant ChatGPT is luring you
into a hallucinogenic forest of nonexistent species and fake legal
precedents — you need a friend who will recommend a pause. That friend
is Clippy, the much-maligned Microsoft Office paperclip…</p>

<p>I am overdue. <br /><br />So, on Tuesday, as I said last week, I was
up at 4:30 to fly to Liverpool. I saw Ms Helene Stephenson, a senior
consultant there, who greeted me familiarly although I am ashamed to
admit I don’t remember meeting her before. <br />I got good news (for a
change).<br /><br />They are happy with how it’s uniting, and as soon as
1 year post-operation, they could maybe remove the plate in my wrist –
that is right under the skin, and causes me pain, which is why I’ve
taken to wearing a towelling wristband on that wrist. I don’t need to
bang it; just resting on a hard surface hurts.<br /><br />I can lift
heavier loads now, increasing slowly. (I was told to avoid any load over
1kg in July or so.) <br /><br />I can start swimming, and start
physiotherapy to try to build up some strength and increase the
rotation. I’ve made an appointment for January, and went for a swim on
Saturday and it was OK. It felt weird but it didn’t
hurt.<br /><br />Regarding my loss of supination (that’s the rotation in
the forearm: pronation is turning the palm of your hand downwards, for
example to type. I can do that. Supination is turning the palm upwards,
for instance to hold a bowl of soup. Soup -&gt; supination,
geddit?)<br /><br />Ms Stephenson thinks that maybe, with lots of
effort, I can regain as much rotation as I had before, although no more
than that. That would be a big deal. I haven’t been able to turn my palm
flat since the mid-1980s but not being able to hold my hand vertical,
like a blade or for a kung-fu chop downwards, is a major
handicap.<br /><br />It’s the first positive news in 9mth, and my
spirits are a little lifted.<br /><br />Then I went for a belated veggie
fry-up, followed by a pint, then a visit to Pete Young and family, which
was great. They’ve been looking after the laptop Douglas Spencer lent me
in hospital, and my noise-cancelling headphones as recommended by Tomáš
Brukner shortly before Ada arrived. I’ve really missed
those!<br /><br /><img src="https://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=lproven&ditemid=309122" width="30" height="12" alt="comment count unavailable" style="vertical-align: middle;"/>

<p>One interesting way to make our feed readers smarter about working
with Mastodon and Bluesky is to do the same kind of mapping from account
to feed we do with sites that support
<a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2011/12/17/rssAutodiscovery.html">feed
discovery</a>. When we see the user is trying to subscribe to a Mastodon
account, we know where its feed is, so subscribe to that. Same for
Bluesky. I expect we’ll do that for FeedLand via the
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/reallysimple/tree/main/demos/feedhunter">FeedHunter
package</a>.</p>

read
<a href="https://inessential.com/2023/12/17/on_mastodon_support_in_netnewswire">Brent’s
piece</a> on Mastodon and NetNewsWire, holding my breath hoping he’d
arrive at the same answer I did, and he did.
<a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> is perfect for
Mastodon, it supports RSS, as does NNW (of course), and that’s imho
exactly the right way to connect the two. That’s how we’re doing it in
<a href="https://feedland.com/">FeedLand</a>. And in case Brent reads
this, the same approach works for Bluesky, which has excellent RSS 2.0
support thanks to the work done by John Spurlock. The RSS 2.0 support
there has more features than Mastodon’s RSS feeds, but so far is not
part of the Bluesky platform (I am urging them to adopt it). Here’s the
<a href="https://rss.firesky.tv/?filter=from:brentsimmons.bsky.social">feed</a>
for Brent’s account on Bluesky, and
<a href="https://rss.firesky.tv/?filter=from:scripting.com">mine</a>.
RSS is a perfect format for open non-silo’d social web apps. It gives us
the most interop, most quickly. They should all be getting on board the
RSS bandwagon, asap, imho. It’s too good an opportunity to pass up.</p>

<h2 id="on-mastodon-support-in-netnewswire">On Mastodon Support in
NetNewsWire</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-18, from: Innessential (Brint Simmons’ blog)</p>
<p>
Tim Chambers, admin of the Mastodon server indieweb.social, which hosts
my personal account and the NetNewsWire account,
<a href="https://indieweb.social/@tchambers/111596493325633510">asked
me</a> if ActivityPub support is on the roadmap for NetNewsWire. Great
question!
</p>
<p>
Tim was responding to
<a href="https://mastodon.social/@ricmac/111596432765792578">Richard
MacManus</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Are there any RSS Readers that are trying to integrate ActivityPub too?
Pondering the glut of email newsletters in our inboxes these days, and
wondering if we are due for an RSS Reader renaissance, except with a
fediverse twist this time…
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I hear this. It’s not the first time this has come up, and I’ve spent
the past year or so thinking about it.
</p>
<p>
Since RSS is an open web thing that brings you stuff people write, and
ActivityPub is also an open web thing that brings you stuff people
write, it’s an obvious good idea to do both in the same app. Totally.
</p>
<p>
But the question was specifically about NetNewsWire.
</p>
<p>
We will make NetNewsWire work better with Mastodon-generated RSS feeds.
There are some things we’re not doing yet that will make reading these a
better experience.
</p>
<p>
But should NetNewsWire become a Mastodon client? That’s where the answer
is not so obvious.
</p>
<p align="center">
<ul>
<li><ul>
<li>*
</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>
Let’s compare the NetNewsWire and Mastodon experiences.
</p>
<p>
NetNewsWire is a three-paned RSS reader. Sidebar (accounts, folders,
feeds) on the left. Timeline (titles and/or first few lines) in the
middle. Article on the right.
<a href="https://netnewswire.com/screenshots.html">See these
screenshots</a> to get the idea.
</p>
<p>
Each article has a read/unread status. Selecting an article marks it as
read, and there are commands to mark all as read (and mark all as read
above or below the selection).
</p>
<p>
This is not the only good model for an RSS reader, but it’s how
NetNewsWire works — and it’s a bad fit for a Mastodon reading
experience.
</p>
<p>
Whether you use Mastodon on the web or in an app you’re used to a single
timeline per account (with perhaps side streams for mentions and such).
All posts from everyone you follow appear in that single timeline. You
don’t deal with read/unread status — instead you have a chronological
position.
</p>
<p>
The timeline shows the entire post (usually), instead of an optional
title and first few lines. There is no third article view, because the
entire post is displayed in the timeline.
</p>
<p>
This experience isn’t unique to Mastodon, of course — that’s how X,
Threads, Micro.blog, Bluesky, and other social media apps work.
</p>
<p>
But it’s not how NetNewsWire works, and if we try to mash that
experience into the app — but have it on only when a Mastodon account is
selected — we’d end up with a confusion that feels like two very
different apps. Because it would be.
</p>
<p align="center">
<ul>
<li><ul>
<li>*
</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>
A second option: we could not change the experience and just assume that
some people would like to use Mastodon in a NetNewsWire way instead of
in the usual social media way. I’m extremely skeptical of this idea — I
think it would be a pain, and I think most people who try it would drop
it.
</p>
<p>
The third option, which I think is best, which we already do, is to
support Mastodon via RSS. (Mastodon feeds are usually available as RSS
— you can add <code>.rss</code> to the end of a URL to get a feed.)
</p>
<p>
There might be some Mastodon accounts you want to follow in your RSS
reader instead of in your Mastodon client. Think of an account for a
website that doesn’t have an RSS feed, but that reliably posts links to
articles. Or a person you want to follow — but you don’t want to show up
in their follower list. (Sounds a little antisocial, sure, but you can
imagine good reasons.)
</p>
<p>
We can, and will, do more to make Mastodon-over-RSS a good experience in
NetNewsWire. Right now we’re not picking up avatars or image
attachments, which we can fix. There might be more things like that to
do. We might add the ability to post to Mastodon, since it’s a natural
thing to want to share stuff from your RSS reader to Mastodon.
</p>
<p>
But I don’t think we’ll make NetNewsWire a real Mastodon client.
</p>
<p align="center">
<ul>
<li><ul>
<li>*
</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>
It still seems like RSS and Mastodon could fit in the same app, though!
If I were designing it, I’d start with the social media experience: the
single timeline of posts. Very simple sidebar. No article view. No
read/unread status — just position in the timeline.
</p>
<p>
You could add RSS feeds, but they’d be treated like Mastodon posts. Any
article short enough would appear in full in the timeline, but most
would probably have to be truncated. You’d open articles in your
browser, just like you do now with social media apps (there’d be no
third article pane).
</p>
<p>
Such an app could be a nice unified experience. Get your Mastodon,
Threads, RSS feeds, Micro.blog and, hopefully, other services — anything
that supports ActivityPub, RSS, or some other open format or API — all
in one place, in a way that’s already familiar to everyone.
</p>
<p>
Sounds pretty great! But it’s not NetNewsWire.

<p>The last episodes of

the actors were willing to go along with it. The only good part was
where the Queen does standup near the end of the last episode. Something
like 80 hours of TV behind them, and all of a sudden this stoic
character, with no sense of humor whatsoever, who can’t even cry, is
bringing down the house. Oh please. I had to stick around to see how bad
it can get, now you don’t. If I had to give it a rating it would be

<p>date: 2023-12-17, from: FreeDOS News</p>
<div class="markdown_content">
<p>
The FDISK program creates and manages partitions on a hard drive.
FreeDOS FDISK recently had two new maintenance releases that fixed
several bugs. 1.3.10 increased compatibility with some older quirky IDE
controllers and added an Italian translation. Version 1.3.11 fixed a bug
where FDISK was not writing the partition table of the 8th disk. You can
download the new versions from the FDISK repository
<a class="" href="https://github.com/FDOS/fdisk" rel="nofollow">on
GitHub</a> or more directly from the
<a class="" href="https://github.com/FDOS/fdisk/releases" rel="nofollow">releases

a movie,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Duel_(2021_film)">The
Last Duel</a>, more or less at random, based largely on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Duel_(2021_film)#Cast">who</a>
was in it, and the fact that the
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/13/movies/the-last-duel-review.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Gk0.YAJS.AGdcc4Vz9G0C&hpgrp=k-abar&smid=url-share">NYT</a>
gave it a critic’s pick rating. It was good. But this isn’t a movie
review, it’s a review of the user interface for choosing movies on
streaming services. Why can’t we integrate a site like
<a href="http://metacritic.com/">Metacritic</a> with Hulu, Netflix,
Amazon, Max, AppleTV, et al. Just let me know what Metacritic says, and
make it clickable, so I can see what the individual pubs had to say if I
want more info. Don’t make me look it up. People joke about how we spend
our time scrolling around not watching anything. But it’s true, I do it.
Most of them are not worth the time, I suspect. But when you find one
that’s good, almost at random and even so had to do a lot of work to
determine if it was worth a chance, and this has been going on for a
decade, why doesn’t one of these services just buy Metacritic and
integrate it and make your users sing your praises everywhere online.
How much could Metacritic cost? (They seem to be in trouble, a lot of
the links generated by their CMS are broken.)</p>

<p>date: 2023-12-17, from: Howard Jacobson blog</p>
<p>‘Why are there hippos on the beach?’ I asked the lifeguard. He looked
like an older Tadzio from Death in Venice, clad in striped
concentration-camp pyjamas, conscious of his beauty. He answered my
question with a question. ‘You’ve heard of liposuction?’</p>
