Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0627 PM CST Mon Nov 13 2023

Valid 140100Z - 141200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated thunderstorms remain possible along a small part of the
Florida Atlantic Coast, and in the lee of Lake Ontario.

...01z Update...

Weak short-wave trough is advancing toward the central Gulf Basin
early this evening. This low-latitude feature will approach the FL
Gulf Coast toward sunrise but will also gradually weaken as it
translates east. While the primary surface low will lag considerably
over the northwest Gulf, deep easterly flow into the FL Peninsula
continues to favor scattered showers. Moist profiles and weak
buoyancy may prove adequate for a few deeper updrafts capable of
generating a few flashes of lightning later tonight. Even so, this
activity should remain quite sparse.

Scattered lake-enhanced convection is producing lightning as it
approaches the southeast coast of Lake Ontario between Oswego and
Sodus Point NY. While a few flashes of lightning may advance 50-60
mi downstream of the lake, the primary concentration of lightning
should hold over/near the warmer waters.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0343 PM CST Mon Nov 13 2023

Valid 151200Z - 211200Z

Fire weather concerns remain low through the extended period. An
upper-level ridge across the Intermountain West will shift eastward
across the central US by D3 - Wednesday as a trough deepens within
the Pacific. This pattern will bring primarily light winds and
warming conditions across much of the central US, along with cooler
conditions and precipitation chances in the Western US D3 -
Wednesday through D6 - Saturday. Westerly flow across the Rockies
will allow lee troughing to develop across the High Plains with
periods of locally breezy/dry conditions D3 - Wednesday and D4 -
Thursday. However, minimal overlap of the strongest winds and low RH
limits confidence in the development of any more than elevated
fire-weather conditions.

Late next week, the central US ridge will lose amplitude as a wave
shifts by to the north. The Pacific trough will slowly eject into
the Desert Southwest, with increasing southwest winds accompanied by
cool and wet conditions. This will keep fire concerns low across the
Southwest despite the increase in wind speeds. Surface low
development across the central/southern Plains late in the period
may bring some increase in fire weather concerns but also potential
for wetting rainfall.
