Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0642 AM CST Wed Nov 15 2023

Valid 151300Z - 161200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not forecast.

...Synopsis/Discussion...
The synoptic/upper-air pattern over the CONUS will be dominated by
three troughs (and related smaller-scale features):

1.  A northern-stream perturbation, splitting eastward out of mean
troughing over the northeast Pacific, across BC and the Canadian
Rockies.  This feature should extend across much of SK and
northern/western MT by 12Z tomorrow, remaining too removed from
sufficient low-level theta-e to support thunderstorm potential
despite cold air aloft.

2.  A Pacific cutoff low, centered around 500-550 nm off the central
CA coast, forecast to drift erratically southward/southwestward
through the period.  A basal shortwave trough is apparent in
moisture-channel imagery approaching 130W, south of the main mid/
upper low, with sporadic lightning detected.  This feature should
eject northeastward across parts of the central/southern CA
coastline between 00-03Z, while deamplifying.  An associated band of
enhanced large-scale DCVA/lift should precede the trough across the
region and inland, steepening mid/upper-level lapse rates over a
cool, moist, stable low-level profile.  Elevated MUCAPE to around
500 J/kg is possible (rooted between 700-800 mb), amidst 35-40 kt
effective-shear magnitudes.  This indicates that the most vigorous
cells may produce small hail or locally gusty winds through the
stable low-level profiles.  Organized severe appears unlikely.

3.  A southern-stream trough -- initially apparent from central/
southern MS to a prominent low/middle-level vorticity max near the
Mississippi River mouth, then across the central Gulf toward the
Yucatan Peninsula.  The low-level circulation should drift
erratically near its present position today, then shift farther
offshore and weaken tonight, as the trough aloft starts to eject
away from the low-level vortex.  A low-level baroclinic zone --
extending from the low east-southeastward over parts of south FL --
should remain quasistationary through the period.  Mesobeta-scale
oscillations of the diffuse surface boundary are possible in
response to areas of precip (including embedded thunderstorms) to
its north.  Lapse rates, lift and deep shear each should remain too
weak for overland severe.  A few weak/shallow supercells may occur
around the Keys, with slightly enlarged hodographs in deep low-level
eaterlies, but weak flow aloft.  The greatest convective
coverage/intensity should remain over the open Gulf, where marine
moisture/heat fluxes are maximized into the boundary layer near the
Loop Current.

Southwestern Caribbean Sea:<br /> A broad area of disorganized showers
and thunderstorms over the <br /> southwestern Caribbean Sea is
associated with a trough of low <br /> pressure. Environmental
conditions appear marginally conducive for <br /> development of this
system, and a tropical depression could still <br /> form by the weekend
while the system begins moving northeastward <br /> across the western
and central portions of the Caribbean Sea. <br /> Interests in Jamaica,
Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, the <br /> southeastern Bahamas,
and the Turks and Caicos Islands should <br /> monitor the progress of
this system. Regardless of development, this <br /> system has the
potential to produce heavy rains over portions of the <br /> Caribbean
coast of Central America and the Greater Antilles through <br /> the
weekend.<br /> * Formation chance through 48 hours…low…30 percent.<br />
* Formation chance through 7 days…medium…50 percent.<br /> <br /> 2.
Offshore Southeast Coast of United States:<br /> A non-tropical area of
low pressure is expected to develop near <br /> southern Florida along a
surface trough over the next day or so. <br /> This system is then
forecast to move northeastward near the Bahamas <br /> and offshore of
the east coast of the U.S. late this week and over <br /> the weekend.
Although development into a tropical cyclone appears <br /> unlikely,
this system is expected to produce gusty winds and heavy <br /> rains
across portions of southern Florida, the Florida Keys, and the <br />
Bahamas during the next couple of days. For more information on <br />

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0156 AM CST Wed Nov 15 2023

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Fire weather potential is expected to be limited for Thursday across
the country. Latest guidance continues to depict the passage of a
cold front across the Plains through the day. Post-frontal winds are
forecast to gust to 25-35 mph, but cooling temperatures behind the
front should limit RH reductions and the potential for prolonged
fire weather conditions. Westerly downslope flow ahead of the front
along the Front Range may support localized elevated fire weather
conditions with winds gusting to 20 mph and RH falling into the low
20s. Such conditions appear most likely from central CO to northern
NM, but are expected to remain fairly localized and transient. Dry
conditions will persist across the southern
Appalachians/Mid-Atlantic with RH minimums in the 20-30% range, but
weak winds will mitigate more robust fire weather concerns.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1059 AM CST Mon Nov 13 2023

Valid 141200Z - 151200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not forecast across the contiguous United
States on Tuesday.

...Synopsis...
A zone of progressive westerlies and associated mid-level shortwave
troughs will reside across the northern tier of states on Tuesday. 
The primary feature for convective interest will be a weak mid-level
trough/low over the lower MS Valley and Gulf of Mexico as it slowly
moves east during the period.  A surface low initially over the
western Gulf of Mexico will develop northeastward to be near the
mouth of the MS River by early Wednesday morning.  Weak instability
will be confined to southeastern LA eastward to Mobile Bay.  A few
elevated, weak thunderstorms are possible, especially Tuesday night
close to the coast.  Farther east, a few weak thunderstorms are
possible over the southern third of the FL Peninsula, but only weak
storm intensity is expected.  Elsewhere, surface high pressure will
influence weather conditions across much of the Lower 48.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1059 AM CST Mon Nov 13 2023

Valid 131700Z - 141200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No changes were made to the current D1 Fire Weather Outlook. Morning
surface observations show relative humidity around 20 percent with
winds gusting around 20-30 mph across eastern Colorado into western
Kansas and Nebraska, where Elevated fire weather concerns are
expected today. Further drying and warming will continue through the
afternoon as dry/warm westerly downslope winds increase and diurnal
heating leads to a deepening mixed layer. See previous discussion
for more information.

..Thornton.. 11/13/2023

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1253 AM CST Mon Nov 13 2023/

...Synopsis...
Elevated fire weather conditions appear probable this afternoon
across parts of the High Plains. Early-morning water-vapor imagery
depicts an upper-ridge gradually shifting east from the northern
Rockies into the Plains. Although slight surface pressure rises have
been noted over the past 6-12 hours along the northern High Plains,
the expectation is for steady pressure falls through the day as
increasing west/southwest flow aloft drive lee troughing. In
response, 15-20 mph westerly winds are expected across eastern WY.
Antecedent dry conditions combined with downslope warming/drying and
diurnal heating should support widespread RH reductions into the low
teens and single digits. Although areas of elevated conditions
appear likely, latest fuel guidance continues to suggest that most
fuels are only modestly receptive, which limits confidence in the
overall fire weather threat. 

To the southeast into northwest KS and adjacent portions of CO and
NE, 15-25 mph southerly winds are expected to the east of the
deepening lee trough. Recent surface observations show some degree
of moisture return ongoing across the southern Plains, but this will
likely be insufficient to offset the influence of diurnal
heating/mixing, leading to another day of 15-25% RH values across
western KS into NE (though a dry bias is noted in recent HRRR/RAP
runs which cast some uncertainty on afternoon RH minimums). Fuel
guidance remains somewhat nebulous regarding fuel status, but 30-day
rainfall deficits, coupled with dry conditions over the weekend, has
likely allowed for sufficient curing of finer fuels across parts of
northwest KS/northeast CO. An Elevated risk area is introduced where
confidence in receptive fuels should best overlap stronger winds/low
RH.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0940 AM CST Mon Nov 13 2023

Valid 131630Z - 141200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated thunderstorms appear possible along a small part of the
Florida Atlantic Coast, and in the lee of Lake Ontario.

...Synopsis...
Upper-ridging, coupled with a surface anticyclone centered over the
OH/TN Valleys, will support mass subsidence and static stability
across most of the CONUS today, limiting thunderstorm potential. A
surface low and associated marginal buoyancy appear to be too far
offshore from the lower TX coastline to support a threat for
organized thunder, hence the removal of the general thunder line
(though a lightning flash or two cannot be ruled out). Modest
cooling aloft amid low-topped convection advecting off of Lake
Ontario may support enough buoyancy (albeit scant) to support a
couple of lightning flashes later today. Otherwise, modest warm-air
advection inland across portions of the east-central FL coastline
may support an isolated thunderstorm later tonight.
