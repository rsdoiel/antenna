## Charles Payseur Reviews Short Fiction: Zooscape, Cast of Wonders, and Worlds of Possibility

date: 2023-12-12, from: Locus Magazine

<p>Zooscape 8/23
Cast of Wonders 8/29/23, 9/3/23
Worlds of Possibility 8/23</p>
<p>I’ll kick things off with the August issue of Zooscape, which focuses on furry specula­tive fiction. So it makes sense that the issue lingers on the deep wounds that exist within and between animals, including humans. From extinctions and apocalypses to quieter hurts and the kindnesses that heal them, Zooscape once more shows the versatility of furry speculative fiction,  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2023/12/charles-payseur-reviews-short-fiction-zooscape-cast-of-wonders-and-worlds-of-possibility/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

## Cait Corrain Controversy

date: 2023-12-12, from: Locus Magazine

<p>Author Cait Corrain&#8217;s 2024 debut novel <strong>Crown of Starlight </strong>has been removed from Del Rey&#8217;s schedule today after Corrain was accused of creating numerous fake Goodreads accounts for the purpose of leaving negative reviews for other authors on the popular site. Corrain&#8217;s agent, Rebecca Podos of Rees Literary Agency, has also cut ties with the writer.</p>
<p>The &#8220;review bombing&#8221; was publicized last week by author Xiran Jay Zhao, who compiled  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2023/12/cait-corrain-controversy/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

## Liz Bourke Reviews The Fractured Dark by Megan E. O’Keefe

<p><strong>The Fractured Dark</strong>, Megan E. O’Keefe (Orbit US 978-0-316-29113-2, $18.99, 544pp, tp.) Sep­tember 2023.</p>
<p><strong>The Fractured Dark </strong>is the second novel in Megan E. O’Keefe’s Devoured Worlds trilogy. The first book, <strong>The Blighted Stars</strong>, is a fast-paced and viciously readable planetary opera adventure with intelligent fungus, AI descending into dysfunc­tion, ecological critique, explosions, banter, and a touch of inadvisable romance to make the whole cocktail go down more  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2023/12/liz-bourke-reviews-the-fractured-dark-by-megan-e-okeefe/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

<p><strong>A Traveller in Time: The Critical Practice of Maureen Kincaid Speller</strong>, Maureen Kincaid Speller (Luna Press 978-1-91555-620-2, £16.99, 308pp, tp) September 2023.</p>
<p>I never had the pleasure of meeting Maureen Kincaid Speller in person, but we correspond­ed on email and social media. Talking virtu­ally with Maureen was always a delight, moreso when she approached me to review Rod Duncan’s <strong>Unseemly Science </strong>for Strange Horizons.
