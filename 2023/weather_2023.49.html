Day 1 Convective Outlook

Valid 082000Z - 091200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
ARKLATEX AND OZARKS...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe storms are possible this evening and overnight
across the ArkLaTex and Ozarks.

...20Z Update...
No changes have been made to the severe probabilities. Uncertainty
remains regarding storm coverage this evening/tonight from the
ArkLaTex into the Ozarks, but a conditional supercell threat remains
evident. See the previous discussion below for more details. 

A cluster of elevated storms may develop later this evening across
parts of western/central MO and move northeastward in conjunction
with an ejecting midlevel shortwave trough. While favorable
deep-layer shear may support some organization with this cluster,
the hail threat appears limited by weak buoyancy and a primarily
cluster/linear mode, while the wind threat will be limited by
cool/stable near-surface conditions. This area will continue to be
monitored into the evening, in case shorter-term observational
trends support somewhat more favorable instability across the
region. Also, the general thunderstorm area has been expanded
slightly northeastward, since stronger convection may reach portions
of southeast WI before the end of the period.

..Dean.. 12/08/2023

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1030 AM CST Fri Dec 08 2023/

...Ozarks/ArkLaTex...
Height falls will regionally increase late today into tonight owing
to the interface of a northern Plains shortwave trough and the
east/northeastward ejection of a trough/jet streak from the
central/southern Rockies. As this occurs, lower/some middle 60s F
surface dewpoints are expected to become increasingly prevalent
tonight across the ArkLaTex and sizable portions of Arkansas in
advance of a front and dryline across Texas.

Thunderstorms are expected to become more probable regionally and
tend to increase in coverage after sunset, and particularly into the
late evening/overnight hours as they move northeastward across the
region. Initial development will be possible across far southeast
Kansas, central /southern Missouri, and eastern Oklahoma/western
Arkansas, with more isolated storms farther south.

Regarding the northern end of development, surface-based buoyancy
should remain limited in vicinity of the near-frontal surface wave
across Missouri. While small hail and/or gusty winds may occur, the
primary surface risk should be focused farther south. 

A few severe storms will be possible across the Arklatex/Arkansas
this evening into the overnight. Hail is the most probable hazard
amidst 40-45 kt effective shear, but forecast soundings suggest that
a few near-surface-based storms could materialize this evening into
the overnight. Accordingly, a low potential for a tornado may also
exist mainly across portions of Arkansas.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0101 PM CST Fri Dec 08 2023

Valid 091200Z - 101200Z

An Elevated risk area is introduced to portions of southern coastal
CA for Saturday. Offshore pressure gradients across southern CA have
steadily been strengthening over the past 6-12 hours, and most
deterministic solutions suggest they should reach peak intensity
Saturday morning (e.g. DAG-LAX gradient between -6 to -9 mb during
the 12-15 UTC period). This should support strong winds gusting
between 30-50 mph (with more isolated gusts near 60 mph) within the
coastal ranges from eastern Ventura/western LA counties southward to
the Mexican border. Downslope warming/drying should support RH
reductions into the low teens in the lee of the terrain. Areas of
elevated to critical fire weather conditions are expected; however,
fuel guidance continues to suggest that most fuels are only modestly
receptive. This should preclude a more robust fire threat, but the
expected wind/RH conditions warrant Elevated highlights. 

The fire weather forecast for southern TX remains on track with only
minor adjustments needed based on trends in recent ensemble
guidance. See the previous discussion for additional details.

..Moore.. 12/08/2023

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1154 PM CST Thu Dec 07 2023/

...Synopsis...
The upper-level trough will move through the southern Plains and
towards the lower Mississippi Valley, amplifying as it progresses.
At the surface, a cold front will continue to the east through the
Plains. Dry, gusty conditions are likely for at least parts of the
southern High Plains into the Rio Grande Valley. RH may end up more
marginal on Saturday compared to Friday due to the cold advection.
Values near 20% appear possible for the Trans-Pecos into the
adjacent Rio Grande Valley. Winds of 15-20 mph (with higher gusts)
are probable as well. Fine fuels are expected to be marginally dry
and support an elevated fire weather threat.

Offshore winds in southern California will likely peak Saturday
morning. Moderately strong winds could continue through much of the
day, particularly in the wind-prone areas. RH could fall as low as
10-15% in some areas with 15-20% being more common. Recent fuel
guidance continues to suggest unreceptive fuels, especially within
the higher elevations. Drier fine fuels are possible in the
valleys/plains. Despite elevated to critical meteorological
conditions, fuels should generally mitigate most concerns. Locally
elevated conditions are still possible for several hours.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM PARTS OF EAST
TX INTO THE TN VALLEY...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms capable of producing a few tornadoes, scattered
damaging winds, and large hail will be possible from east Texas to
the Tennessee Valley, mainly Saturday afternoon and evening.

...Synopsis...
A deep, positively tilted upper-level trough will move eastward
across parts of the central/eastern CONUS on Saturday. Within the
larger-scale trough, an upper-level cyclone initially over MN will
evolve into a shortwave that moves eastward through the day, as a
surface low moves quickly northeastward from the Great Lakes region
toward Hudson Bay. A trailing low-amplitude shortwave trough will
deamplify as it moves from the southern Rockies toward the lower/mid
MS Valley. A cold front will move across the southern Plains and
eventually into parts of the Southeast, with weak surface wave
development possible during the day near the ArkLaTex region. 

...East TX into the TN Valley...
In advance of the cold front, relatively rich low-level moisture
will be in place across parts of TX/LA Saturday morning, and stream
northward into parts of the Southeast and TN Valley through the day.
Modest diurnal heating will support moderate destabilization from
east TX into the ArkLaMiss region (MLCAPE increasing into the
1000-1500 J/kg range), with more modest buoyancy (MLCAPE to near 500
J/kg) potentially extending as far north as southern KY. Meanwhile,
increasing deep-layer flow/shear in advance of the approaching upper
trough will support long hodographs and increasingly favorable wind
profiles for organized convection across the warm sector.

Surface-based thunderstorms are expected to increase in coverage
Saturday afternoon along and perhaps somewhat ahead of the
approaching front, as low-level moistening continues and MLCINH is
eroded. Effective shear of 50+ kt will be more than sufficient for
supercells, though with deep-layer flow largely parallel to the
front, a tendency toward a cluster and/or linear mode is expected
with time. Large hail will be possible with any sustained
supercells. Also, increasing low-level shear will be sufficient to
support a tornado threat with any supercells that can be sustained
from late afternoon into the evening, especially if a stronger
frontal wave can develop. Otherwise, damaging wind and possibly
embedded brief tornadoes may become the primary threat Saturday
night as storms move eastward, with a gradual weakening trend
expected due to diminishing buoyancy. 

Severe probabilities were expanded northeastward somewhat with this
outlook, due to the potential for a couple longer-lived supercells
or organized bowing segments to persist into the evening. Higher
probabilities were trimmed across parts of east TX, where capping
and weaker large-scale ascent are expected to limit storm coverage.

0939 AM CST Fri Dec 08 2023

Valid 081700Z - 091200Z

The previous forecast remains on track with only minor adjustments
needed to reflect recent observations and trends in hi-res guidance.
Across southwest TX, elevated to locally critical fire weather
conditions remain likely by early afternoon. The 12 UTC Midland, TX
sounding sampled a very dry residual boundary layer atop a shallow
nocturnal inversion. Given clear skies across the region, strong
diurnal insolation will likely result in a rapid decrease in RH
accompanied by strengthening westerly winds by around 18 UTC. 15-25
mph winds with RH in the low teens remains likely, but only modestly
dry fuels (ERCs near/below the 50th percentile) should limit a more
robust fire weather threat. 

Along the southern CA coast, an offshore wind regime has become
established with a few locations within the coastal mountains
reporting wind gusts upwards of 30-40 mph. Winds are expected to
gradually strengthen and become more widespread through tonight as
the offshore pressure gradient strengthens through Saturday morning.
Downslope warming/drying should result in a few areas of reduced RH
into the teens, but fire weather conditions are generally expected
to remain fairly localized for today and much of tonight. Fire
weather concerns will increase beginning around 12 UTC Saturday as
the offshore pressure gradient approaches peak intensity.

..Moore.. 12/08/2023

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1153 PM CST Thu Dec 07 2023/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough will be in the process of intensifying and
digging southeastward today. A surface low will deepen in western
Oklahoma during the morning and into the afternoon. Ahead of a cold
front, westerly surface winds will intensify from the South Plains
into the Trans Pecos. Winds of 15-20 mph (locally to 25 mph) and RH
of 15-20% will develop in this downslope regime. Given  at least
marginally dry fuels, elevated to locally critical fire weather is
possible.

Behind the upper trough, surface high pressure will increase within
the Great Basin. Offshore flow will increase across southern
California. Winds will be on the increase late tonight into Saturday
morning. It is not certain how low RH will fall, but a couple hours
of locally elevated fire weather are possible late tonight.

...SUMMARY...
Isolated thunderstorms will be possible in parts of the Pacific
Northwest tonight, but no severe threat is expected.

...DISCUSSION...
The latest water vapor imagery shows a shortwave trough in the
central and northern Plains, with zonal flow located over much of
the Desert Southwest. In addition, a shortwave trough is located
across the Pacific Northwest. As this feature moves further inland
tonight, isolated lightning strikes will be possible in western
Oregon and western Washington. Isolated thunder is also possible in
parts of far northeast Oregon and west-central Idaho. No severe
threat is expected, and thunderstorms are unlikely across the
remainder of the continental U.S.

Dry and breezy north-northwesterly flow is expected across portions
of the Southern High Plains on Saturday. However, temperatures are
expected to be cool, and fuels only marginally dry. Therefore, no
critical probabilities are warranted. Sunday and beyond, a
relatively benign fire weather pattern is expected. A few periods of
weak lee troughing and some increase in southerly flow across the
High Plains, but nothing appears strong enough to warrant
probabilities. Elsewhere, cold conditions or most fuels preclude
fire weather concerns.

Thunderstorm areas are not expected through early Wednesday morning.

...Synopsis/Discussion...
In mid/upper levels, a progressive and fairly well-amplified
synoptic pattern will carry through the period, led by a strong
trough moving across the eastern CONUS, and ridging over the Rockies
and High Plains.  A strong shortwave trough -- apparent in moisture-
channel imagery over portions of WI/IL/MO -- will move eastward
across the Appalachians tonight and through the larger-scale trough.
Smaller shortwaves will move from northwestern ON across the Upper
Great Lakes, and separately, southeastward rapidly from the northern
Plains to the Ozarks and portions of the Southeast.  Late this
afternoon into evening, enough cooling aloft and residual low-level
moisture will be in place to support around 100 J/kg MUCAPE ahead of
the leading perturbation, in a corridor from southern OH to eastern
TN.  However, forecast soundings suggest buoyancy will remain below
an optimal icing layer for lightning, though a rogue strike or two
cannot be ruled out. 

Otherwise, a long-fetch, warm-advection conveyor ahead of the next
Pacific trough will settle southward down the Northwest Coast,
reaching northwesternmost CA around the end of the period.  Lapse
rates in this plume should remain too weak to support areas of
thunderstorms.
