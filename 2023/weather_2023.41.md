Mesoscale Discussion 2250
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1212 PM CDT Fri Oct 13 2023

Areas affected...Parts of central IA

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 131712Z - 131845Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...A few brief tornadoes and isolated hail are possible this
afternoon.

DISCUSSION...A deep-layer cyclone currently centered near the IA/NE
border will move eastward across western/central this afternoon. A
surface front extends northeastward from the low into northwest IA,
then arcs southeastward across central IA into northern MO.
Widespread cloudiness is noted along/ahead of the front, though some
thinning and cloud breaks have recently developed across parts of
north-central and south-central IA. 

As pre-frontal temperatures warm through the 60s F within a modestly
moist boundary layer, MLCAPE will increase into the 300-700 J/kg
range. Weak convection has already developed in Pocahontas County,
with additional development expected by early/mid afternoon
southward along the frontal boundary. A band of storms is expected
to evolve by mid afternoon, with modestly favorable effective shear
(generally 30-35 kt) potentially supporting embedded supercell
structures, especially from central into south-central IA. 

A combination of modestly favorable low-level shear/SRH and ambient
vertical vorticity associated with the cyclone will support a threat
of a few brief tornadoes this afternoon, both within a
hybrid/marginal supercell environment across central/south-central
IA, and a landspout environment into parts of
north-central/northwest IA. Cool temperatures aloft may also support
isolated hail with the strongest storms. While coverage and
magnitude of the threat may remain relatively limited, tornado watch
issuance is possible this afternoon if confidence in the potential
for multiple tornadoes increases.

1208 PM CDT Fri Oct 13 2023

Valid 141200Z - 151200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PARTS OF
THE COASTAL CAROLINAS...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms appear possible Saturday across parts
of the coastal Carolinas.

...Mid-Atlantic...

An upper trough will spread east from the Midwest toward the
Mid-Atlantic on Saturday. This will bring a belt of 50-60 kt
west/southwesterly 500 mb flow over the central/southern
Appalachians to the Eastern Seaboard. In the midlevels, more
south/southwesterly flow is expected, with around 30-40 kt 850-700
mb flow progged across the Carolinas toward the southern Chesapeake
Bay vicinity. At the surface, a weak low is forecast to move
north/northeast along the SC/NC coastal plains, while a broader
synoptic low develops east along the WV/PA/MD border vicinity. A
cold front will shift east across the central/southern Appalachians
while a warm front extends east from the PA/MD surface low into
southern NJ. 

Deeper boundary-layer moisture will remain across the coastal
Carolinas toward the Delmarva vicinity where upper 60s/low 70s
dewpoints are forecast. Warm advection will likely result in some
cloudiness and showers, with only modest boundary-layer heating
occurring ahead of the eastward advancing cold front and surface
low. This will limit stronger destabilization, though a narrow
corridor of 500-1000 J/kg MLCAPE is possible across eastern NC.
Relatively strong deep-layer flow and vertically veering wind
profiles will result in effective shear magnitudes greater than 40
kt, with enlarged, curved low-level hodographs. While weak
instability and relatively warm temperatures aloft will limit
updraft intensity/depth, a few strong storms capable of locally
damaging gusts or a tornado or two will be possible.

Further north near the WV/PA/MD low, boundary-layer moisture will be
limited and meager instability is expected. However, strong vertical
wind profiles suggest a couple of storms with gusty winds or small
hail are possible, though severe potential remains low.

Valid 131630Z - 141200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON
ACROSS CENTRAL IA...

...SUMMARY...
A few severe storms will be possible this afternoon from central
Iowa to west central Illinois and northeast Missouri.

...IA and vicinity through early evening...
A vertically stacked low will move eastward over IA this
afternoon/evening.  A narrow, weakly unstable warm sector will
develop immediately in advance of the surface front and occluded
cyclone from northwest into central/southeast IA from early into mid
afternoon, where surface heating occurs in cloud breaks and
boundary-layer dewpoints hold near 58-61 F.  A band of convection is
expected to form along the front by 18-20z, where low-level ascent
coincides with the left-exit region of the mid-upper jet. 
Deep-layer vertical shear will be somewhat modest, while vertical
vorticity and low-level lapse rates/CAPE will align with the
boundary, suggesting a mix of low-topped supercells and/or
multicells capable of producing a few tornadoes, marginally severe
hail and isolated strong gusts this afternoon into early this
evening before buoyancy diminishes.

No changes. The large fire threat remains minimal today.

..Bentley.. 10/13/2023

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1226 AM CDT Fri Oct 13 2023/

...Synopsis...
Surface low pressure will continue to track across the eastern US on
Friday. A cold front will accompany this feature, extending south
across the Ohio River Valley/Upper Mississippi River Valley and
westward into the central and southern Plains. Post-frontal
northwesterly breezes are forecast across portions of Kansas,
Oklahoma, and northern/central Texas. Across southwestern Texas,
northwesterly breezes will overlap relative humidity reductions to
around 15-20 percent. Recent rainfall across this region has
rendered fuels less receptive to fire spread. Status of fuels and
generally cooler temperatures will mitigate the risk of fire spread
and preclude the need to include highlights.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM CENTRAL
IOWA TO NORTHERN/WESTERN ILLINOIS AND EASTERN MISSOURI...

...SUMMARY...
A few severe storms will be possible this afternoon from central
Iowa to northern/western Illinois and eastern Missouri.

...Synopsis...
In mid/upper levels, a Rex pattern covering much of
north-central/central North America will transition back toward an
omega configuration, as:
1.  An anticyclone persists over central Canada, and
2.  A pronounced cyclone -- initially centered over NE -- travels
eastward roughly along I-80 to the southern Lake Michigan shore
region around 12Z tomorrow.  By 00Z today, the 500-mb low should be
near DSM.

The corresponding surface low was analyzed at 11Z over northeastern
NE near OFK, with cold front to near an STJ-CNU-SPS-FST line, and
warm front across south-central/southeastern IA to southern IL.  The
low should shift across southern/central IA through the day, nearly
in step with its nearby mid/upper-level counterpart, as the warm
front moves slowly northeastward over eastern IA and western IL.  By
00Z, the triple point should be over west-central/central IL, ahead
of the low, with cold front across southeastern MO, southern AR, and
east through south-central TX.  A separate, quasistationary frontal
zone across north-central FL should move little through most of the
afternoon, then slowly southeastward in response to cyclogenesis
near coastal SC.  That development should be related to the advance
of the mid/upper cyclone across the Midwest/Great Lakes, and
shortwaves traversing the basal cyclonic flow.  While isolated
thunderstorms will be possible along and south of the FL front atop
a richly moist boundary layer, severe potential there should be
muted by lack of stronger shear, lapse rates and lift.

...IA/IL/MO region...
Scattered thunderstorms should develop from midday through the
afternoon in one or two arcs east through southeast of the surface
low, near the occluded/cold fronts.  Activity should form initially
over western parts of the outlook area, then spread north through
east over it.  A marginal tornado threat exists, with any sustained
supercell(s) being the main concern for that, along with isolated
damaging gusts and low-end severe hail.

With abundant clouds and precip areas ongoing over the region and
only slowly shifting away through much of the morning, diurnal
destabilization will be slow to occur, and much of the buoyancy may
arise from a combination of weak warm advection/heating in low
levels and the eastern fringes of cooling aloft preceding the
progressive mid/upper low.  Surface dewpoints commonly in the mid
50s to low 60s F (locally higher) will support a narrow corridor of
MLCAPE in the 300-700 J/kg range immediately preceding the frontal
arc, amidst 25-40-kt effective-shear magnitudes and effective SRH
generally in the 150-250 J/kg range (maximized just east of the
low).  Instability, lift and low-level shear each should diminish
southward over central/eastern portions of MO/IL.  Convective
organization should diminish with eastward extent and time this
evening as well, due mainly to weakening instability.

Valid 141200Z - 151200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
The risk of fire spread will remain low across the CONUS on
Saturday. Building high pressure across the western US will keep
winds light where the driest air mass resides, within the
southwestern US and southern Plains on Saturday. Pockets of breezy
northwesterly flow will be possible across the central Plains and
the Great Lakes region. However, cooler temperatures will lead to
higher humidity and overall low risk of fire spread.
