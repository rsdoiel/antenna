Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1147 AM CDT Sun Oct 15 2023

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected on Monday.

...Pacific Northwest...
A negatively tilted mid/upper-level shortwave trough is forecast to
move inland across the Pacific Northwest and British Columbia on
Monday. A surface low is forecast to move northward near the BC
coast, with secondary cyclogenesis expected Monday evening in the
lee of the Canadian Rockies. A cold front will begin to move inland
across the Pacific Northwest Monday morning, and move into parts of
the interior Northwest and northern Rockies Monday evening into
Tuesday morning. 

A frontal precipitation band will move through western WA/OR Monday
morning, which may contain some weak embedded convective elements.
Somewhat more robust convection will be possible Monday
afternoon/evening within the post-frontal regime, in closer
proximity to the approaching shortwave trough. Steepening
low/midlevel lapse rates will support at least isolated thunderstorm
potential across western WA and northwest OR. Rather strong
low/midlevel flow and cool temperatures aloft may support gusty
winds and small hail with the strongest storms, but very weak
buoyancy and a tendency for convection to be rather
shallow/low-topped is expected to limit severe potential.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1145 AM CDT Sun Oct 15 2023

Valid 151700Z - 161200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No changes. Fire weather conditions are expected to be minimal
today.

..Bentley.. 10/15/2023

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1148 PM CDT Sat Oct 14 2023/

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns remain low across the CONUS today. High
pressure will continue to build across the western and central US
with troughing across the eastern US. An impulse rotating
through the eastern trough will increase northerly gradients across
the Great Plains into the Ohio and Mississippi River Valleys.
Northerly breezes will be possible, but generally cool temperatures,
higher relative humidity, and moist fuels will keep the risk of fire
spread low. Relative humidity across Louisiana may drop as low as
35-40 percent amid sustained winds around 15 mph.  Latest fuel
guidance suggests fuels within this region are moist from recent
rainfall, which precludes the need to add areas at this time.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1101 AM CDT Sun Oct 15 2023

Valid 151630Z - 161200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected.

...Synopsis...
An initial wind shift and association convection has shifted south
of the FL Keys and into the FL Straits.  Farther northwest, the
synoptic cold front (denoted by a narrow cloud line) will continue
to move southeastward across south FL and the Keys this afternoon
into this evening.  Lingering low-level moisture and shallow ascent
along the front could support isolated thunderstorm development
later this afternoon/evening, but storm coverage will be rather
sparse.  Otherwise, a midlevel shortwave trough will approach the
Pacific Northwest early Monday, but any threat for isolated
lightning flashes will occur after 12z.

Day 1 Convective Outlook

0731 AM CDT Sun Oct 15 2023

Valid 151300Z - 161200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected.

...Synopsis...
In mid/upper levels, a positively tilted longwave pattern is
expected to persist over most of the CONUS, with ridging from the
Desert Southwest across the northern Rockies/High Plains to Hudson
Bay.  Mean troughing will continue from an elongated cyclone over
the Canadian Maritimes southwestward across the Northeast, central/
southern Appalachians and northern Gulf.  The associated surface
cold front has cleared all of the East Coast, except for a small
area of extreme southern FL and the Keys, where weak convergence and
a moist boundary layer still may support showers and isolated
thunderstorms south of some midlevel stable layers sampled by the
12Z MFL RAOB.  Elsewhere, a strong shortwave trough over the
northeastern Pacific -- evident in moisture-channel imagery between
140W-150W -- will remain far enough offshore through the period that
any associated thunderstorm-favoring destabilization aloft should
not move inland in the Northwest until day 2.

## SPC Tornado Watch 710

date: 2023-10-13, from: NOAA tornado/severe thunderstorm watches, mesoscale discussions, convective outlooks, fire weather outlooks

<br /><a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/ww0710.html"><img src="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/ww0710_radar.gif" border="1" alt="WW 0710 Image" hspace="1" vspace="1" width="525" height="459" align="center" /></a><pre>

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 710
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
125 PM CDT Fri Oct 13 2023

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Central into southeast Iowa

* Effective this Friday afternoon and evening from 125 PM until
  800 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A few tornadoes possible
  Isolated damaging wind gusts to 60 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1 inch in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Scattered low-topped thunderstorms will form this
afternoon along a slow-moving front across central Iowa.  The storm
environment will favor of mix of multicells and some supercells
capable of producing a few tornadoes, along with isolated marginally
severe hail and wind gusts.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 35 statute miles
north and south of a line from 35 miles west northwest of Fort Dodge
IA to 30 miles south of Cedar Rapids IA. For a complete depiction of
the watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS
WOU0).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 1 inch. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 50 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 350. Mean
storm motion vector 18020.

...Thompson

Mesoscale Discussion 2250
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1212 PM CDT Fri Oct 13 2023

Areas affected...Parts of central IA

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 131712Z - 131845Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...A few brief tornadoes and isolated hail are possible this
afternoon.

DISCUSSION...A deep-layer cyclone currently centered near the IA/NE
border will move eastward across western/central this afternoon. A
surface front extends northeastward from the low into northwest IA,
then arcs southeastward across central IA into northern MO.
Widespread cloudiness is noted along/ahead of the front, though some
thinning and cloud breaks have recently developed across parts of
north-central and south-central IA. 

As pre-frontal temperatures warm through the 60s F within a modestly
moist boundary layer, MLCAPE will increase into the 300-700 J/kg
range. Weak convection has already developed in Pocahontas County,
with additional development expected by early/mid afternoon
southward along the frontal boundary. A band of storms is expected
to evolve by mid afternoon, with modestly favorable effective shear
(generally 30-35 kt) potentially supporting embedded supercell
structures, especially from central into south-central IA. 

A combination of modestly favorable low-level shear/SRH and ambient
vertical vorticity associated with the cyclone will support a threat
of a few brief tornadoes this afternoon, both within a
hybrid/marginal supercell environment across central/south-central
IA, and a landspout environment into parts of
north-central/northwest IA. Cool temperatures aloft may also support
isolated hail with the strongest storms. While coverage and
magnitude of the threat may remain relatively limited, tornado watch
issuance is possible this afternoon if confidence in the potential
for multiple tornadoes increases.

## SPC Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook

date: 2023-10-13, from: NOAA Weather Forecasts

<br /><a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/fire_wx/fwdy2.html"><img src="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/fire_wx/day2fireotlk.gif" border="1" alt="Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook Image" hspace="1" vspace="1" width="815" height="555" align="center" /></a><pre>
Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0138 AM CDT Fri Oct 13 2023

Valid 141200Z - 151200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
The risk of fire spread will remain low across the CONUS on
Saturday. Building high pressure across the western US will keep
winds light where the driest air mass resides, within the
southwestern US and southern Plains on Saturday. Pockets of breezy
northwesterly flow will be possible across the central Plains and
the Great Lakes region. However, cooler temperatures will lead to
higher humidity and overall low risk of fire spread.
