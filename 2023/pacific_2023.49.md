## OPINION | ‘Burning desire’ from inside the Cabinet

date: 2023-12-05, updated: 2023-12-05, from: Marianas Variety

THE Governor’s bi-weekly Cabinet meeting was missing a distinct voice this past Friday and the Governor began the meeting with a call “for a moment of silence for the late Ross Manglona” who passed away earlier in the week.  I didn’t know him well, but he certainly had a captivating voice and a seemingly contagious sense of humor.  Very apparent as well was his intellect, he was a smart guy to say the least.  My deepest condolences to all who were close to him — I imagine the void he leaves among those closest to him to be vast.
