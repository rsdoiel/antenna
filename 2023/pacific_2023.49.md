## OPINION | Truth 28: Our vocal & silent politicians!

date: 2023-12-07, updated: 2023-12-07, from: Marianas Variety

THE TRUTH of the matter is our leaders are NOT as unified as they need to be if the CNMI is to gain any real footing &amp; synergy (forward progress) in addressing our Economy which dictates to a high-degree the quality of life in the CNMI. WE the People are witnessing the same old “one-man show” to a large degree when it comes to representing the People of the CNMI.  TOOOOO often I fail to see a real united effort to accomplish goals other than FOR the GOP’s gambling issues and passage of legislation, which is not enough!  They are still talking about E-gaming, a 4 or 5 year old matter. Voting “yes or no” does NOT fully represent the People’s desires on all the issues facing the CNMI. There should have been a slew of our leaders supporting Rep. Marissa Flores complaining about the Casino Commission (CC), especially when there is over 141-million at stake when WE are counting pennies. Rep. Flores is doing the work FOR the People by speaking-out &amp; protesting but from where I sit with the rest of us regular folks, she is not getting any real help from her counterparts in the legislature.  All it takes for malfeasant behavior to exist in the CNMI is for the good leaders &amp; people to do &amp; say nothing, which is what is happening with the CC and Our Money that is going unchecked with NO accountability.

## OPINION | ‘Burning desire’ from inside the Cabinet

date: 2023-12-05, updated: 2023-12-05, from: Marianas Variety

THE Governor’s bi-weekly Cabinet meeting was missing a distinct voice this past Friday and the Governor began the meeting with a call “for a moment of silence for the late Ross Manglona” who passed away earlier in the week.  I didn’t know him well, but he certainly had a captivating voice and a seemingly contagious sense of humor.  Very apparent as well was his intellect, he was a smart guy to say the least.  My deepest condolences to all who were close to him — I imagine the void he leaves among those closest to him to be vast.
