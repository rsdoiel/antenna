## Spying through Push Notifications

date: 2023-12-07, updated: 2023-12-06, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>When you get a push notification on your Apple or Google phone, those notifications go through Apple and Google servers. Which means that those companies can spy on them&#8212;either for their own reasons or in response to government demands.</p>
<p>Sen. Wyden is trying to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/governments-spying-apple-google-users-through-push-notifications-us-senator-2023-12-06/">get to the bottom of this</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In a statement, Apple said that Wyden&#8217;s letter gave them the opening they needed to share more details with the public about how governments monitored push notifications.</p>
<p>&#8220;In this case, the federal government prohibited us from sharing any information,&#8221; the company said in a statement. &#8220;Now that this method has become public we are updating our transparency reporting to detail these kinds of requests.&#8221;...</p></blockquote>

## Security Analysis of a Thirteenth-Century Venetian Election Protocol

date: 2023-12-06, updated: 2023-12-06, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Interesting <a href="https://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/2007/HPL-2007-28R1.html">analysis</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>This paper discusses the protocol used for electing the Doge of Venice between 1268 and the end of the Republic in 1797. We will show that it has some useful properties that in addition to being interesting in themselves, also suggest that its fundamental design principle is worth investigating for application to leader election protocols in computer science. For example, it gives some opportunities to minorities while ensuring that more popular candidates are more likely to win, and offers some resistance to corruption of voters...</p></blockquote>

## Apple Makes a Quiet AI Move

The star of the new chip is the GPU, with a new &#8230;

## AI and Mass Spying

date: 2023-12-05, updated: 2023-12-05, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Spying and surveillance are different but related things. If I hired a private detective to spy on you, that detective could hide a bug in your home or car, tap your phone, and listen to what you said. At the end, I would get a report of all the conversations you had and the contents of those conversations. If I hired that same private detective to put you under surveillance, I would get a different report: where you went, whom you talked to, what you purchased, what you did.</p>
<p>Before the internet, putting someone under surveillance was expensive and time-consuming. You had to manually follow someone around, noting where they went, whom they talked to, what they purchased, what they did, and what they read. That world is forever gone. Our phones track our locations. Credit cards track our purchases. Apps track whom we talk to, and e-readers know what we read. Computers collect data about what we&#8217;re doing on them, and as both storage and processing have become cheaper, that data is increasingly saved and used. What was manual and individual has become bulk and mass. Surveillance has ...</p>

## AI and Trust

date: 2023-12-04, updated: 2023-12-05, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>I trusted a lot today. I trusted my phone to wake me on time. I trusted Uber to arrange a taxi for me, and the driver to get me to the airport safely. I trusted thousands of other drivers on the road not to ram my car on the way. At the airport, I trusted ticket agents and maintenance engineers and everyone else who keeps airlines operating. And the pilot of the plane I flew in. And thousands of other people at the airport and on the plane, any of which could have attacked me. And all the people that prepared and served my breakfast, and the entire food supply chain&#8212;any of them could have poisoned me. When I landed here, I trusted thousands more people: at the airport, on the road, in this building, in this room. And that was all before 10:30 this morning...</p>
