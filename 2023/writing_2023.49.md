## Gary K. Wolfe Reviews Monstrous Alterations by Christopher Barzak

date: 2023-12-05, from: Locus Magazine

Lovecraft, John Kessel on Austen and  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2023/12/gary-k-wolfe-reviews-monstrous-alterations-by-christopher-barzak/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

date: 2023-12-05, from: Locus Magazine

<p>Y<strong>ou began publishing SF stories about five years ago. Describe how you got your start as a writer, and your path to publication.</strong></p>
<p>I came to short fiction by chance. The goal was always to publish a novel, as the received wisdom was that if one wanted to earn some sort of liv­ing through writing, or reach a wider audience, then publishing full-length novels was the way to go.  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2023/12/interview-with-tobi-ogundiran/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

<p>Yume Kitasei’s <strong>The Deep Sky </strong>is three books wrapped into one. At once a locked-room (locked ship, in this case) whodunit, an interstellar adven­ture that discusses a very plausible future, and a story that explores mother-daughter relationships as well as friendship, <strong>The Deep Sky </strong>is a very timely science fiction narrative that looks at some of the dark  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2023/12/gabino-iglesias-reviews-the-deep-sky-by-yume-kitasei/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>
