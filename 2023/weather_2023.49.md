Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0628 PM CST Wed Dec 06 2023

Valid 070100Z - 071200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated lightning flashes remain possible across portions of the
northern Pacific Coastal region tonight.

...01z Update...

Early-evening water-vapor imagery depicts a lead short-wave trough
ejecting inland across northern CA, arcing northwest off the OR/WA
Coasts. Isolated flashes of lightning have been noted immediately
ahead of the short wave, and primarily offshore, west of OR.
Profiles will cool/steepen overnight as 500mb temperatures lower to
-30C across western OR/WA, with values at least -20C north of the
jet over northern CA. As a result, weak buoyancy will continue to
favor some risk for isolated thunderstorms.

## SPC Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook

date: 2023-12-06, from: NOAA tornado/severe thunderstorm watches, mesoscale discussions, convective outlooks, fire weather outlooks

<br /><a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/exper/fire_wx/"><img src="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/exper/fire_wx/imgs/day38otlk_fire.gif" border="1" alt="Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook Image" hspace="1" vspace="1" width="815" height="555" align="center" /></a><pre>
Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0343 PM CST Wed Dec 06 2023

Valid 081200Z - 141200Z

A strong mid-level jet streak will cross nrthern California tomorrow
and carve out a large trough across the southern Plains on Friday.
This trough will become neutrally tilted across the eastern CONUS
before eventually becoming negatively tilted across the Northeast.
In the wake of this mid-level trough, a strong cold front will bring
a continental polar airmass across much of the United States. 

...Day 3/Fri Southwest into Far West Texas...
Dry and windy conditions are expected across southern New Mexico and
Far West Texas on Friday. A weak lee cyclone may lead to some
tightening pressure gradient. However, strong winds will primarily
be driven by a moderate to strong mid-level jet overspreading a
deeply mixed airmass with stronger winds reaching the surface. In
addition, 10 to 15F above normal temperatures will lead to relative
humidity in the teens and further support some fire weather threat.
ERC values remain near seasonable normals, but dormant, fine fuels
continue to cure and may support some fire spread and an increase in
initial attack. 

Some dry and breezy conditions are also possible on Day4/Sat in
portions of the TX/OK Panhandle and vicinity. However, these
conditions are expected in the post-frontal airmass where
temperatures will be cool and therefore, fire weather concerns
should be reduced. 

A weak mid-level shortwave trough embedded in the northwesterly flow
across the Central Rockies may result in some weak cyclogenesis on
Sunday across the central Plains. This may cause some dry and breezy
conditions across the southern High Plains. However, confidence in
stronger wind speeds is not high enough to necessitate probabilities
at this time.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0158 PM CST Wed Dec 06 2023

Valid 062000Z - 071200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are unlikely through tonight.

...20Z Update...
The primary change with this update was removing the General
Thunderstorm area over Idaho and Montana. Most short-range guidance
depicts very minimal instability over the area, and any thunderstorm
activity should remain very isolated. Elsewhere, the forecast
remains on track.

..Weinman/Leitman.. 12/06/2023

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1027 AM CST Wed Dec 06 2023/

...Western OR and northern CA...
A strong upper trough is approaching the coast of northern CA and
southwest OR, with the associated surface cold front moving ashore
in the next couple of hours.  Strong onshore flow, lift in vicinity
of the front, and cold temperatures aloft may result in isolated
lightning flashes this afternoon along the coastal ranges and
interior mountains of northern CA/western OR.  Present indications
are that this activity will be quite sparse.

...ID/MT...
Later tonight, the aforementioned shortwave trough will track inland
and affect portions of ID/MT.  Steep mid-level lapse rates and
continued strong large scale lift will result in convective showers
over the mountains of central ID into western MT.  Profiles will be
quite cold, but pockets of weak instability may be sufficient for a
few lightning flashes - mainly after midnight.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No changes. See previous discussion below.

..Bentley.. 12/06/2023

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1226 AM CST Wed Dec 06 2023/

...Synopsis...
A belt of strong mid-level westerly flow will move across the
Rockies on Thursday. At the surface, a cyclone will begin to develop
across the central Plains. As a result, dry and warm westerly
downslope flow will increase across portions of the Southern Plains.
Afternoon relative humidity reductions to around 15 percent will
overlap sustained winds at 15-20 mph across portions of eastern New
Mexico into the Texas and Oklahoma Panhandles. Fuels within this
region are largely near normal moisture and only marginally
receptive to spread. Locally Elevated fire weather conditions will
be possible in areas where fine fuels have cured and become dormant.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1125 AM CST Tue Dec 05 2023

Valid 061200Z - 071200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected on Wednesday.

...Synopsis...
A midlevel trough will track eastward from the northeast Pacific
into the northwestern CONUS, as an attendant cold front moves ashore
over coastal Oregon and northwest California. Cold temperatures
aloft/steepening lapse rates atop adequate boundary-layer moisture
will yield sufficient buoyancy for embedded lightning flashes within
a larger swath of precipitation. This activity may persist from the
late afternoon into the overnight hours. Shallow/weak buoyancy
should generally limit strong/severe storm potential despite a
modest increase in low-level shear/hodograph curvature along
immediate coastal areas late in the period. 

Elsewhere, cool/stable surface conditions will limit thunderstorm
potential.

Fire weather concerns remain minimal today. See previous discussion
below.

..Bentley.. 12/05/2023

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1120 PM CST Mon Dec 04 2023/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level ridge will shift eastward over the Divide today. At
the surface, high pressure will strengthen in the Plains as it moves
southeastward with time. Surface high pressure will also remain
within the Great Basin into the Western Slope. Fire weather concerns
throughout the CONUS should remain low given generally unreceptive
fuels and light winds. Some stronger offshore winds are likely in
southern California. These winds will peak this morning before
weakening through the day. Though fuels are not overly receptive and
the lowest RH will not phase well with the strongest winds, locally
elevated conditions would be possible where pockets of dry fuels
exits within the terrain.

Valid 051300Z - 061200Z

...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorm areas are not expected through early Wednesday morning.

...Synopsis/Discussion...
In mid/upper levels, a progressive and fairly well-amplified
synoptic pattern will carry through the period, led by a strong
trough moving across the eastern CONUS, and ridging over the Rockies
and High Plains.  A strong shortwave trough -- apparent in moisture-
channel imagery over portions of WI/IL/MO -- will move eastward
across the Appalachians tonight and through the larger-scale trough.
Smaller shortwaves will move from northwestern ON across the Upper
Great Lakes, and separately, southeastward rapidly from the northern
Plains to the Ozarks and portions of the Southeast.  Late this
afternoon into evening, enough cooling aloft and residual low-level
moisture will be in place to support around 100 J/kg MUCAPE ahead of
the leading perturbation, in a corridor from southern OH to eastern
TN.  However, forecast soundings suggest buoyancy will remain below
an optimal icing layer for lightning, though a rogue strike or two
cannot be ruled out. 

Otherwise, a long-fetch, warm-advection conveyor ahead of the next
Pacific trough will settle southward down the Northwest Coast,
reaching northwesternmost CA around the end of the period.  Lapse
rates in this plume should remain too weak to support areas of
thunderstorms.
