## Forget spaceships; I just want my music

date: 2023-12-12, from: Jeff Geerling blog

<span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Forget spaceships; I just want my music</span>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>A couple weeks ago, as my kids settled into the car, I asked like I always do, "what songs do you want me to play?"</p>

<p>They have a range of favored earworms, from Baby Shark to Babaloo, and usually the songs are tolerable, at least.</p>

<p>But a few albums, like Bluey's soundtrack, transcend the children's genre. They're genuinely fun to listen to, for everyone in the car.</p>

<p>Well, that fine day, the kids chose Ladybug Music. And let me tell you, besides a few duds, Ladybug Music <em>slaps</em>. And the songs incorporate diverse styles, too, it's not just the same nursery rhymes regurgitated in a bubbly voice.</p>

<p>So I found the album on my phone and noticed the songs were all greyed out.</p>

<p>I tapped one, and <em>nothing</em>. Just this notice:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/song-not-available.jpg" width="700" height="auto" class="insert-image" alt="Song not available Apple Music on iPhone" /></p>

## Things I don't have to do

I spent a lot of time and energy in my life worrying about things I felt like I had to do for one reason or another. Either everyone else was doing the thing, or specific people were pressuring me to do the thing, or I never saw real examples or models of people who didn&rsquo;t do the thing, etc.
At some point I started to realize that, if I really challenged myself, I didn&rsquo;t have to do some of the things I believed I had to in order to win at life (and I would include the idea of having to &ldquo;win at life&rdquo; on this list).

## Apple releases iOS 17.2 and macOS 14.2

date: 2023-12-12, from: OS News

Today, Apple pushed out the public releases of iOS 17.2, iPadOS 17.2, macOS Sonoma 14.2, watchOS 10.2, and tvOS 17.2. iOS 17.2 and iPadOS 17.2&#8217;s flagship feature is the new Journal app, which Apple teased when it first introduced iOS 17 earlier. The app mimics several existing popular journaling apps in the App Store from third-party developers but leverages data from your Photos, workouts, and other Apple apps to make journaling suggestions. Other features include the ability to tap a &#8220;catch-up arrow&#8221; to scroll to the first missed message in a conversation in Messages, the ability to take spatial video photos for later viewing on Vision Pro, and several tweaks and additions to the Weather app. ↫ Samuel Axon for Ars Technica Makers of journalling applications for iOS are not going to be in a good mood today, I reckon.

## Bots, again

date: 2023-12-11, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1>Bots, again</h1>

<p>I come home from a friendly meetup and notice that my tiny web-server has a load of 80 instead of the usual 0.5. What the hell is going on? I look at the logs of the last 24 hours and see an IP number with more than 100 000 hits in the last 24h. What are they doing?</p>

<p>Whois tells me it is from the &ldquo;Alibaba Cloud&rdquo;. Oh yeah? What are the Chinese trying to do on my site?</p>

<p>I start poking around. More and more IP numbers from all over the net show up. Alibaba Cloud, Tencent Cloud.</p>

<p>All right, so I&rsquo;m blocking some of them individually as I go, but after a while I realize that I probably have to block them at the network level.</p>

<p>For the moment I&rsquo;m also taking down one of the wikis that&rsquo;s overloading my server.</p>

<p>Just looking at the top 10 offenders for two of my domains, and running whois on them to find the entire network they belong to, and checking that it&rsquo;s Alibaba or Tencent:</p>

<pre><code># Alibaba Cloud 2023-12-10
RewriteCond &quot;%{REMOTE_ADDR}&quot; &quot;-R '47.76.0.0/14'&quot; [or]
RewriteCond &quot;%{REMOTE_ADDR}&quot; &quot;-R '47.80.0.0/13'&quot; [or]
RewriteCond &quot;%{REMOTE_ADDR}&quot; &quot;-R '47.74.0.0/14'&quot; [or]
RewriteCond &quot;%{REMOTE_ADDR}&quot; &quot;-R '47.235.0.0/16'&quot; [or]
RewriteCond &quot;%{REMOTE_ADDR}&quot; &quot;-R '47.246.0.0/16'&quot; [or]
RewriteCond &quot;%{REMOTE_ADDR}&quot; &quot;-R '47.244.0.0/15'&quot; [or]
RewriteCond &quot;%{REMOTE_ADDR}&quot; &quot;-R '47.240.0.0/14'&quot; [or]
RewriteCond &quot;%{REMOTE_ADDR}&quot; &quot;-R '47.236.0.0/14'&quot; [or]
# Tencent Cloud
RewriteCond &quot;%{REMOTE_ADDR}&quot; &quot;-R '42.192.0.0/15'&quot; [or]
RewriteCond &quot;%{REMOTE_ADDR}&quot; &quot;-R '49.232.0.0/14'&quot; [or]
RewriteCond &quot;%{REMOTE_ADDR}&quot; &quot;-R '101.34.0.0/15'&quot; [or]
RewriteCond &quot;%{REMOTE_ADDR}&quot; &quot;-R '43.142.0.0/16'&quot; [or]
RewriteCond &quot;%{REMOTE_ADDR}&quot; &quot;-R '124.220.0.0/14'&quot;
RewriteRule ^ https://alexschroeder.ch/nobots [redirect=410,last]
</code></pre>

<p>If I want this to be for the entire server and not repeat it for each location, I guess I&rsquo;ll have to use Apache rewrite rules.</p>

<p>While I&rsquo;m doing this, I notice a new pattern… My wiki software allows you to fetch a feed for every page. Either it contains updates to the page (Oddmuse), or a feed of the pages linked (Oddmu). It&rsquo;s for humans.</p>

<p>Of course some shit engineer decided that it was a good idea to scan the web for all the feeds that are out there (so rare! so precious!) and to download them all, forever (uncover the darknet! server our customers!) and now I have to block IP number ranges, add robot agents to robots.txt files (not all of them provide one), or block user agents (not all of them provide a useful one) and I block and block and block (for the environment! to avoid +2.0°C and the end of human civilization!) and all this while I know that all these shit requests exist out there, for all the sites, everywhere – a hundred thousand requests or more per day, per site, wasting CO₂ – and what am I going to do, kill the feeds for humans because some shit engineer decided to feed a machine?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(franchise)#The_Butlerian_Jihad">Butlerian Jihad</a> again.</p>

<p>Oh, and Virgin Media is downloading tons of PDFs I&rsquo;m hosting? Are they looking for copyright violations? On the blocklist they go.</p>

<p>And what&rsquo;s this, Feedly is also downloading feeds like crazy, every few minutes? Slow down, idiots. My news is not important. On the blocklist they go. Or are you trying to train your stupid intelligence? Fuck this AI training stuff. I already use &ldquo;X-Robots-Tag: noimageai&rdquo; but I guess I should add even more HTTP headers to block even more engineers overstepping boundaries?</p>

<p>Ah, and MonitoRSS going into overdrive, from the Amazon Cloud. Really, I don&rsquo;t think there are humans in the Amazon Cloud. Onto the blocklist they go. Well, at least this IP range.</p>

<p>And who&rsquo;s that VelenPublicWebCrawler, zealously collecting pages? Onto the blocklists they go.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Bots">#Bots</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Butlerian_Jihad">#Butlerian Jihad</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Administration">#Administration</a></p>

## Pinebook Pro ROM update brings sound and PCIe

The Pinebook Pro is built around a Rockchip RK3399 processor, and several months of work on the port of RISC OS to this chip means there are a number of improvements to it &#8211; but the two features particularly highlighted by R-Comp are that sound and PCIe are now enabled.

## R-Comp releases ClockSave to prevent chronological chaos

date: 2023-12-11, from: RiscOS Story

In the days of old, the computers RISC OS was supplied on by Acorn included a battery backed real time clock, which &#8211; while the battery lasted &#8211; kept ticking on and maintaining the time. These days, RISC OS runs on a number of single-board computers (SBCs) and not all of them have such a clock. One solution is NetTime, which can check the time from a remote server and thus correct the computer if it has the wrong value, but it can only work via an internet connection, so&#8230;

## Is RISC-V ready for HPC prime-time: evaluating the 64-core Sophon SG2042 RISC-V CPU

date: 2023-12-11, from: OS News

The Sophon SG2042 is the world&#8217;s first commodity 64-core RISC-V CPU for high performance workloads and an important question is whether the SG2042 has the potential to encourage the HPC community to embrace RISC-V. In this paper we undertaking a performance exploration of the SG2042 against existing RISC-V hardware and high performance x86 CPUs in use by modern supercomputers. Leveraging the RAJAPerf benchmarking suite, we discover that on average, the SG2042 delivers, per core, between five and ten times the performance compared to the nearest widely available RISC-V hardware. We found that, on average, the x86 high performance CPUs under test outperform the SG2042 by between four and eight times for multi-threaded workloads, although some individual kernels do perform faster on the SG2042. The result of this work is a performance study that not only contrasts this new RISC-V CPU against existing technologies, but furthermore shares performance best practice. ↫ Nick Brown, Maurice Jamieson, Joseph Lee, Paul Wang The Sophon SG2042 is the RISC-V processor found in the Milk-V Pioneer workstation, which was recently featured on LTT as well, for the video crowd among us. There&#8217;s definitely still a way to go for RISC-V, but the gains over the past few years are clear, and if this keeps progressing this way, it won&#8217;t be long before RISC-V becomes a valid, competitive architecture.

## I bought a keyboard

date: 2023-12-11, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1>I bought a keyboard</h1>

<p>I was at the <a href="https://swissmk.ch/">Swiss Mechanical Keyboard</a> Meetup.
I wanted to get rid of my keyboards and instead I bought one. 😓</p>

<p><a class="account" href="https://chaos.social/@xtaran" title="@xtaran@chaos.social">@xtaran</a>&rsquo;s table with colourful keyboards and a MNT Reform laptop in the middle:</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2023-12-10-keyboards-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a class="account" href="https://fosstodon.org/@deshipu" title="@deshipu@fosstodon.org">@deshipu</a>&rsquo;s table with a lot of very flat keyboards with few keys, some of them steno keyboards:</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2023-12-10-keyboards-2.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Keyboards by Nicolas and Valerio:</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2023-12-10-keyboards-3.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Sam&rsquo;s keyboards:</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2023-12-10-keyboards-4.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>This is the keyboard I bought from Sam:</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2023-12-10-keyboards-5.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>It is labelled as <a href="https://www.monsgeek.com/product/m6/">Monsgeek M6</a>, KTT Matcha, GMK DMG Clones.</p>

<p>Right now my fingers are confused and seemed to expect the Atreus layout I had been using recently, at least as far as the thumbs go.</p>

<p>I get the feeling that not all keys work as intended, though.
The right Ctrl key <del>has no effect</del> is a layer switch that enables &lt; and &gt; to control the volume, for example.
The left Alt key is GUI.
The right Alt key <del>has no effect</del> had a bent pin on their switch.
The App key <del>has no effect</del> had a bent pin on their switch.
The App key is actually Alt.
The ] and = keys <del>have no effect</del> had a bent pin on their switches.
The Volume Up key is mapped to Delete.
The Volume Down key is mapped to Prior.
The Mute Key is mapped to Next.</p>

<p>Hm.</p>

<p>As it turns out, the problem was the firmware. My guess is that it was too old.</p>

<p>So here&rsquo;s what I did:</p>

<ul>
<li>download <code>monsgeek_m6_via.bin</code> from <a href="https://www.caniusevia.com/docs/download_firmware">the VIA site</a></li>

Obviously, at some point Musk will sell Twitter to Zuckerberg.

So many of our friends on the web are happy to let Facebook run the new Twitter. What is wrong with you. I don't know any better way to put it. Quitting Twitter is pointless, meaningless, powerless. But not building Threads for Facebook is not meaningless. For once can people look out for the future, keep the window open for independence for writers and developers, and let us try out some new ideas that might not be something Zuckerberg would love? Come on already. This is the saddest moment, when there's so much possibility, and you all are ready to just throw it away. (And no, I don't believe for a minute they're going to do anything that helps the Fediverse. I know the playbook. Saying you'll be open is what you do until you dominate, then it's just business. Truth is it's always just business, and saying you're going to be open at this stage of network development <i>is</i> good for business.)

## General note

date: 2023-12-11, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>If you develop one of the ideas I write about here, tell me about it!</p>
<p>Let me try it out. Lately there have been people doing this, but for some reason I don't find out about the work until it's too late.</p>
<p>What are people thinking? If I ask for something, there's a reason -- I want to learn from it.</p>
<p>I think programmers are shy. You need to stop doing that. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span></p>
<p>And of course I'll share what I learn here on my blog, of course.</p>

## Working together for writers

date: 2023-12-11, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2020/06/29/alice.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I want to say this as loudly and clearly as I can. If we want independent writing on the web to flourish, we need our own search engine, to help us find each other, and build associations of writers, so we can influence each other, and help developers create new tools for all writers. Or simply to find something I wrote about 15 years ago, so I can refer back to it. I really don't have a good way yet to find stuff I've written. It's all there on the web, for crying out loud. </p>
<p>More important, we need to learn to work together, we do very very little of that. It's amazingly difficult to get a new idea heard by other developers. This is a huge problem, it's why we've always been dominated by big companies who don't care about what we do. </p>
<p>Start with a search engine for bloggers. I'll help. And let's do lots of them, so no one can stand in the way of trying out new ideas. </p>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2023-12-11, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

And in order for that to happen, we have to do newsworthy things for them to write about! We're not doing that. It started out well, with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Women%27s_March#:~:text=The%20Women's%20March%20was%20a,to%20the%20rights%20of%20women.">Woman's March on January 20, 2017</a>, but that was it. We can and must keep showing up, and I'm not advocating huge marches, I want to see neighborhood-level marching. Once a month, rain or shine, we all walk (if possible) or drive to our voting places, where there will be music, food, people with ideas, dancing, whatever you like. Making civic participation a regular thing. You go because you want to be there. Not against something but <i>for</i> all of us. All we have to do is figure out how this works, how to beat the drum, to get the ball rolling. The idea is that if we got close to 100 percent voter participation, our democracy would be in the best shape it's been in probably since inception. I had another idea that's worth considering. We should all wear the same button, just a picture, no slogans, an idea of what we stand for as Americans. It could be an American flag, or it could be a photo of <a href="http://scripting.com/2016/12/30/theMlkButtonsArrived.html">Martin Luther King</a>. The latter was my choice. People love the button, but it didn't catch on. If we all did, it's omission would be noticed, and we'd know there's someone we should talk with about America and offer them a free button, nicely, if they'll put it on right now. Anyway, I'm putting this out there again, and I'll keep doing it.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2023-12-11, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

Starting in September or so I start thinking about <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+boty">Blogger of the Year</a>, a thing I do at the end of most years. Not too many people care, but it's a good thing for me to do -- to review what makes a blog the most interesting and valuable of the year, to me -- obviously. We all should name a BOTY, or give out any award we feel is deserved. People think "well it's just me and I don't matter" -- which is totally true, and is why you might as well pick someone. At least <i>they'll</i> know you appreciate them. And it gets you to think about what you value, which builds over time to a better understanding of everything. Last year I <a href="http://scripting.com/2023/01/01.html#a032915">chose</a> Heather Cox Richardson, whose <a href="https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com/">Substack site</a> is a constant read for me. Every night an email arrives, at different times, and if I'm up and in the mood, I'll spend a few minutes with HCR and it's always illuminating. She was my choice last year because her writing re-kindled my interest in American history, and I started reading books on most slavery, something that was seriously missing from my NYC education, and is so important to who we are as a country.

## Too many news orgs adopt right-wing frames about trans people

date: 2023-12-11, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

## Bringing the Unix philosophy to the 21st century

date: 2023-12-11, from: OS News

The Unix philosophy of using compact expert tools that do one thing well and pipelining them together to manipulate data is a great idea and has worked well for the past few decades. This philosophy was outlined in the 1978 Foreword to the Bell System Technical Journal describing the UNIX Time-Sharing System:  Items i and ii are oft repeated, and for good reason. But it is time to take this philosophy to the 21st century by further defining a standard output format for non-interactive use. ↫ Kelly Brazil This seems like a topic people will have calm opinions about.

## How we got here

date: 2023-12-10, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>First an apology. To all the people who clicked on a <a href="https://feedland.com/?river=true&screenname=davewiner">link</a> to a FeedLand page on a phone in the past, I am sorry to have put you through that. Now that it works on phones, I can see how nice it is to be able to skim the news while you're out and about. </p>
<p>When you're working alone on a huge product like this, you have to keep your head down and focus on the problem of the moment. There have been some huge ones this year. The product's identity system had to be replaced, while people were using it, because Twitter was getting ready to explode their API. Then the move from a Digital Ocean server to the <a href="https://docs.wpvip.com/technical-references/node-js/">Automattic VIP server</a> required fairly large pieces of the software to be rewritten, again, in-place, while feedland.org continued to run. There's a huge change between writing software for a server where the runtime environment doesn't include local storage. Everything has to be stored in a database. </p>
<p>All the pieces were rewritten, one by one, until we discovered another that needed to be rewritten. And then at almost the last minute I <a href="http://scripting.com/2023/10/09/135922.html">decided</a> we had to have <a href="http://scripting.com/2023/10/21/143159.html">reading lists</a>, because of the kind of feed network I wanted to build with this product. And one more thing, let's get this mofo working on mobile devices as it was meant to, which turned out to be not as hard as I imagined, and very nice to have. </p>
<p>The new version of the software with all the new code turned on is at <a href="https://feedland.com/">feedland.com</a>. That's the version that's running on Automattic's servers, and should be able to scale to far more users. The docs aren't converted yet, but the software is basically the same. You should read the <a href="http://docs.feedland.org/firstThings.opml">first page</a> of the docs, at least, so you aren't surprised to find out that your subscriptions are public. This is not the usual kind of feed product, it's more of a community of news users. Just like a social network, you can see what other people are reading. The idea of FeedLand is to see what would happen if instead of building something complicated around conversations, we limited ourselves to what feeds could do and then see where we could go with that. That's what FeedLand is. </p>
<p>PS: I can't believe how fast Automattic's system is. I don't understand how it does all that work in so little time. </p>
<p>PPS: The menus are different on the mobile version, by necessity. I included the Bookmarks menu, it's really important to have the news you want to read available one click away in mobile. I imagine doing setup on your home computer, with links you'll use when you're using the mobile version. </p>

## BSD on Windows: things I wish I knew existed

date: 2023-12-10, from: OS News

It’s 1995 and I’ve been nearly two years in the professional workspace. OS/2 is the dominant workstation product, Netware servers rule the world, and the year of the Linux desktop is going to happen any moment now. If you weren’t running OS/2, you were probably running Windows 3.1, only very few people were using that Linux thing. What would have been the prefect OS at the time would have been NT with a competent POSIX subsystem, but since we were denied that, enter Hiroshi Oota with BSD on Windows. ↫ neozeed at Virtually Fun This is absolutely wild.

Heard on ski lift: "I'm not particular, I'll work with anyone as long as the goal is to keep one company from controlling something worthwhile."
