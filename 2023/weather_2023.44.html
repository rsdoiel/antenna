Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0445 PM CDT Wed Nov 01 2023

Valid 031200Z - 091200Z

Weak ridging over the western US will slowly de-amplify as the main
upper-air pattern shifts toward zonal flow through the extended
forecast period. Strong westerly flow aloft will develop over the
central and southern CONUS this weekend, continuing through next
week. More amplified flow may return late in the forecast period,
but there remains substantial uncertainty. With conditions generally
favoring weaker winds and cooler temperatures, fire-weather concerns
are expected to remain relatively low.

...Southwest to the Southern High Plains...
As zonal flow becomes established later in the forecast period,
strong winds aloft will begin to overspread the region this weekend
into early next week. Aided by lee troughing, downslope westerly
winds of 15-25 mph are possible late this weekend, with humidity
values gradually falling into early next week. The dry and somewhat
cool air mass should eventually support RH values below 20% over a
fairly wide area across NM and parts of the TX Panhandle. Despite
the favorable meteorological conditions, uncertainty on fuel dryness
is very high after recent rainfall and freezing temperatures. Most
ERC guidance shows well-below normal values across eastern NM and
the southern High Plains where the best overlap of strong winds and
low humidity are expected. Thus, while localized fire-weather
concerns are possible, uncertainty on the availability of fuels
remains too high for probabilities at this time. Elsewhere across
the US, weaker winds and cool temperatures should serve to limit
fire-weather concerns through the next 7 days.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 PM CDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Pilar was
located near latitude 12.4 North, longitude 91.7 West.  Pilar is
moving toward the west near 10 mph (17 km/h).  A faster west-
southwestward motion is expected by tonight or early Thursday, and 
that motion should continue into Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 50 mph (85 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Some weakening is forecast during the next 
couple of days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Pilar can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO header WTPZ44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP4.shtml
 
RAINFALL:  Pilar is expected to produce additional rainfall of 1 to
2 inches, with local amounts to 4 inches, for portions of Central
America from southern El Salvador, across southern Honduras, western
Nicaragua, and northern Costa Rica through Wednesday. The additional
rainfall may produce flash and urban flooding, along with mudslides
in areas of higher terrain.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Pilar are expected to continue affecting
the Pacific coast of Central America during the next couple of days.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather
office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Tropical Storm Pilar Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP192023
400 PM CDT Wed Nov 01 2023
 
Convection over and near Pilar's low-level circulation continues to
flare periodically.  A recent burst of convection has obscured the
center on visible satellite imagery.  Satellite intensity estimates
have trended downward this cycle, with 45 kt from TAFB and SAB
and a range of 33-49 kt from various objective estimates.  The
initial intensity has been lowered to 45 kt based on these values.
 
Pilar is accelerating westward with an estimated motion of 270/9
kt.  This general motion with an increase in forward speed is
forecast for the next few days as the storm is steered along the
south side of a mid-level ridge.  The model guidance has
accelerated again from the previous advisory.  The latest forecast
track is a blend of the prior prediction and the latest simple and
corrected consensus aids.
 
Moderate deep-layer vertical wind shear is expected to persist for
at least another 24 hours.  While the shear decreases beyond a day,
Pilar will likely encounter a drier, more stable airmass associated
with a Gulf of Tehuantepec gap wind event.  These environmental
conditions, along with cooler, upwelled ocean waters should result
in a gradual weaken trend as indicated by the majority of the
dynamical intensity guidance.  The official intensity forecast
reflects this scenario and is closest to the simple model consensus. 
There remains the possibility that Pilar could weaken sooner and 
become a post-tropical cyclone or open into a trough.  However, the 
official forecast conservatively maintains a 5-day forecast for now.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Additional heavy rainfall from Pilar will produce flash and urban
flooding, along with mudslides in areas of higher terrain of the
Pacific coast of Central America from southern El Salvador, across
southern Honduras, western Nicaragua into northern Costa Rica
through today.
 
2. Swells generated by Pilar will continue to affect the Pacific
coast of Central America during the next day or two.  These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.

fire-weather concerns low over the CONUS.

..Lyons.. 11/01/2023

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1132 PM CDT Tue Oct 31 2023/

...Synopsis...
Surface high pressure and cooler temperatures will linger across
portions of the Southeast to the East Coast as relatively zonal
upper-level flow becomes established over the CONUS tomorrow
(Thursday). Weak forcing associated with the aforementioned weather
patterns should continue to promote dry surface conditions across
the southeast quadrant of the CONUS tomorrow. However, surface winds
will also be weak, with wildfire-spread potential expected to remain
localized at best.

Tropical Storm Pilar Discussion Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP192023
1000 AM CDT Wed Nov 01 2023
 
Deep convection has continued to burst over the western portion of 
Pilar's circulation this morning.  However, the cloud tops have been 
warming during the past couple of hours, and recent visible imagery 
still indicates that the low-level circulation is located near the 
eastern edge of the convection.  The initial intensity is again held 
at 50 kt, which is a blend of the latest subjective Dvorak T- and 
CI-numbers from TAFB and SAB.
 
Recent satellite fixes show that Pilar is now moving westward or
270 degrees at 6 kt. A much faster westward to west-southwestward
motion is expected during the next few days as a narrow mid-level
ridge builds across southern Mexico.  The dynamical model guidance
continues to trend toward a faster solution, and the NHC track
forecast has again been sped up from the previous advisory.  The
new forecast track lies between the previous interpolated forecast
and the latest HCCA and TVCE consensus aids.
 
The moderate shear that has been plaguing Pilar is expected to
continue for another day or so.  Although the shear may decrease
somewhat after that time, the storm is likely to encounter a drier
and more stable airmass from an ongoing Gulf of Tehuantepec gap wind
event.  In addition, Pilar is expected to pass over an area of
slightly cooler upwelled waters to the south and southwest of the
Gulf of Tehuantepec.  As a result of these unfavorable conditions,
most of the dynamical model guidance shows gradual weakening
during the next few days, and the NHC intensity forecast follows
suit.  It should be noted that simulated satellite imagery from the
GFS suggests that Pilar could struggle to maintain organized deep
convection by the weekend.  The NHC forecast maintains Pilar as a
tropical cyclone for the entire 5-day period, but it is possible
that the system degenerates into a remnant low or trough before the
end of the period.  There is still a fair amount of uncertainty in 
the longer range status and intensity of the system.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Additional heavy rainfall from Pilar will produce flash and urban
flooding, along with mudslides in areas of higher terrain of the
Pacific coast of Central America from southern El Salvador, across
southern Honduras, western Nicaragua into northern Costa Rica
through today.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are possible along portions of the
Pacific coast of El Salvador where a Tropical Storm Watch remains
in effect.
 
3. Swells generated by Pilar will continue to affect the Pacific
coast of Central America during the next day or two.  These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.

Valid 011300Z - 021200Z

...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
No overland thunderstorm areas are forecast today.

...Synopsis/Discussion...
In mid/upper levels, a longwave trough will persist over eastern
North America, though its amplitude will decrease somewhat, due to
the ejection/weakening of a strong shortwave trough now over Lake
Ontario and the central Appalachians.  Ridging aloft will prevail
over the Pacific Coast States, before a day-2 trough's moving
ashore.  Following a major low-level cold-frontal intrusion across 
the central/eastern CONUS and Gulf, and with a lack of moisture and
lift in the West as well, the air mass will be unfavorable for
thunderstorm areas across the CONUS.

Tropical Storm Pilar Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP192023
400 PM CDT Tue Oct 31 2023
 
Satellite imagery shows that Pilar's center remains exposed on the 
southeast side of the main convective plume. Earlier AMSR2 and 
SSMI/S microwave imagery depicts some partial banding features 
within the northern semi-circle. Scatterometer ASCAT-B and -C passes 
this afternoon shows satellite derived winds are around 40 to 45 
knots. These values are in good agreement with the latest Dvorak 
satellite intensity estimates from both TAFB and SAB, T/3.0 or 45 
knots. Therefore, given the combination of data this the 
initial intensity remains at 45 kt for this advisory.
 
Pilar is moving slowly east-northeastward or 060/3 kt. The storm is 
forecast to move very little tonight as the steering currents over 
the far eastern Pacific collapse. A mid-level ridge is then forecast 
to build to the north and northeast of Pilar, which should cause the 
storm to begin moving west-southwestward. As the mid-level ridge 
continues to build westward, Pilar will be steered on a 
west-southwestward to westward motion along the southern side of the 
ridge. The latest NHC track forecast is similar to the previous 
advisory and lies near the latest consensus aids. The threat of 
tropical-storm-force winds should begin to diminish as Pilar starts 
moving westward, but the risk of heavy rain and flash-flooding is 
expected to continue over portions of Central America over the next 
couple of days.
 
Some slight strengthening is possible during the next day or so as 
the storm is located over warm sea surface temperatures and moderate 
vertical wind shear. In about 2 to 3 days vertical wind shear is 
forecast to weaken, but dry air from a gap wind event from the Gulf 
of Tehuantepec may limit intensification.  Towards the end of the 
period, the environmental conditions may become a little more 
conducive and the official forecast depicts strengthening once 
again. The NHC intensity forecast lies near the corrected HCCA 
consensus aids.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rains from Pilar will produce flash and urban flooding, 
along with mudslides in areas of higher terrain of the Pacific coast 
of Central America from southern El Salvador, across southern 
Honduras, western Nicaragua into northern Costa Rica through 
Wednesday.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are possible along portions of the
Pacific coast of El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua, where a
Tropical Storm Watch remains in effect.
 
3. Swells generated by Pilar will continue to affect the Pacific
coast of Central America during the next few days.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.

Interests elsewhere along the Pacific coast of Nicaragua and in
southern Guatemala should monitor the progress of this system.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 PM CDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Pilar was 
located near latitude 11.4 North, longitude 89.5 West. Pilar is 
moving toward the east-northeast near 3 mph (6 km/h). Pilar is 
forecast to move little tonight into early Wednesday. On the 
forecast track, Pilar could move a little closer to the coast of El 
Salvador or Nicaragua tonight through early Wednesday, though the 
core of the system is expected to remain offshore. The storm is 
forecast to begin moving west-southwestward away from land by 
Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Some slight strengthening is possible over the next day or so before 
gradual weakening likely begins on Thursday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Pilar can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO header WTPZ44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP4.shtml
 
RAINFALL:  Pilar is expected to produce storm total rainfall of 5
to 10 inches, with local amounts to 15 inches, over portions of
Central America from southern El Salvador, across southern Honduras,
western Nicaragua into northern Costa Rica through Wednesday.  This
rainfall will produce flash and urban flooding, along with mudslides
in areas of higher terrain.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Pilar are expected to continue affecting
the Pacific coast of Central America during the next few days. These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible within the Tropical
Storm Watch area during the next day or so.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 PM CDT (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Pilar was
located near latitude 11.6 North, longitude 90.9 West.  Pilar is
moving toward the east-northeast near 5 mph (7 km/h) and this motion
is expected to continue through early Wednesday.  On the forecast
track, Pilar could be near the coast of El Salvador or Nicaragua
Tuesday through early Wednesday, though the core of the system is
expected to remain offshore.  The storm is forecast to move
west-southwestward away from land on Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Further strengthening is expected during the next day or so,
and Pilar could be near hurricane strength on Tuesday.  Weakening is
expected to begin on Wednesday and continue through Thursday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Pilar can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO header WTPZ44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP4.shtml
 
RAINFALL: Pilar is expected to produce storm total rainfall of 5 to
10 inches, with local amounts to 15 inches, over portions of Central
America from El Salvador southward to Costa Rica through Wednesday.
This rainfall will produce flash and urban flooding, along with
mudslides in areas of higher terrain.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Pilar are expected to continue affecting
the Pacific coast of Central America during the next few days. These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions could begin in the Tropical
Storm Watch area early Tuesday.

Tropical Storm Pilar Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP192023
400 PM CDT Mon Oct 30 2023
 
Pilar seems to have held somewhat steady this afternoon.  1-minute 
geostationary satellite visible imagery shows the low-level 
circulation beginning to be exposed just east of the deep convection 
as the central deep overcast gradually clears.  Recent microwave 
imagery revealed a decent curved band wrapping around the western 
and northern portions of the core.  Subjective and objective 
satellite intensity estimates range from 39-51 kt and the initial 
intensity is held at 45 kt, closest to the SAB T3.0/45 kt value.
 
The storm continues to move slowly east-northeastward.  Models 
generally agree on this motion, which should continue for the next 
day or so.  By Tuesday evening, Pilar is forecast to stall near the 
coast of El Salvador with the core of the storm offshore.  By 
Wednesday the storm is expected to turn west-southwestward, away 
from the coastline, in the flow of a building ridge over the western 
Caribbean and Central America.  The latest NHC track forecast is 
shifted slightly north of the previous prediction, largely due to 
the northward shift in the initial position.
 
Moderate east-southeasterly shear appears to be affecting Pilar.  
However, most of the model guidance indicates that the storm should 
steadily strengthen for the next day or so over the warm waters and 
in a moist airmass.  After 36 h, the deep-layer shear should 
increase which will likely induce a weakening trend. By days 3-5, 
the shear is expected to abate somewhat.  Once again, the long-range 
official intensity forecast has been increased slightly and is close 
to the various consensus aids.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rains from Pilar will produce flash and urban flooding,
along with mudslides in areas of higher terrain, near the Pacific
coast of Central America from El Salvador southward to Costa Rica
through Wednesday.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are possible beginning early Tuesday
along portions of the Pacific coast of El Salvador, Honduras, and
Nicaragua, where a Tropical Storm Watch remains in effect. Interests
elsewhere along the Pacific coast of Guatemala, and Nicaragua should
monitor the progress of this system as additional watches or
warnings could be needed later tonight.
 
3. Swells generated by Pilar will continue to affect the Pacific
coast of Central America during the next few days.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
