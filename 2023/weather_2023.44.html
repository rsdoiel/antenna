Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1126 AM CDT Mon Oct 30 2023

Valid 301700Z - 311200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF SOUTHERN CA...

...17z Update...
The previous forecast remains valid with no changes. Offshore winds
should continue into this evening with a risk for critical
fire-weather conditions over parts of southern CA and the LA Basin.
Winds will slowly weaken eventually ending the threat late tonight
into early D2/Tuesday. See the previous discussion for additional
information.

..Lyons.. 10/30/2023

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0157 AM CDT Mon Oct 30 2023/

...Synopsis...
Surface high pressure and cooler air will continue to spread across
much of the CONUS beneath amplifying upper troughing aloft, limiting
significant wildfire-spread potential in most areas. The one
exception will be southern portions of the West Coast. Here, the
western periphery of a surface anticyclone will continue to support
a persisting pressure gradient. Dry and windy offshore conditions
are likely across southern California, with strong northerly surface
flow coinciding with the Lower Colorado River Basin, necessitating
Elevated highlights over both locations. Offshore flow in the higher
terrain surrounding Los Angeles may exceed 20 mph at times, amid
5-15 percent RH, warranting the maintenance of Critical
probabilities.

...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Areas of thunderstorms are not expected today.

A broad upper trough is present today over the Great Lakes region,
while a secondary shortwave trough rotates into the area tonight. 
Warm lake temperatures and cold air aloft pose a risk of convective
showers in the lee of Lake Superior and Michigan.  However, forecast
soundings show a shallow unstable layer and only weak forcing. 
Therefore expect any lightning activity to remain below a 10%
coverage threshold.

Valid 301300Z - 311200Z

...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Areas of thunderstorms are not expected today.

...Synopsis/Discussion...
In mid/upper levels, a positively tiled mean trough will shift
eastward across the central/southwestern CONUS through the period.
This will occur largely in response to a strong shortwave trough --
apparent in moisture-channel imagery over portions of AB/SK.  This
perturbation will dig southeastward by 00Z to the Dakotas,
northwestern MN and adjoining northwestern ON.  As the trough
proceeds overnight toward northwestern MO, IA and WI, an
accompanying 500-mb low should form, reaching the LSE area around
the end of the period. 

All of that will occur well behind a surface cold front, analyzed at
11Z this morning from the Mid-Atlantic region southwestward over the
southern Appalachians to the northwestern Gulf.  By 00Z, the front
should extend from the Hampton Roads region across central GA, the
FL Panhandle and the central/southwestern Gulf.  By 12Z tomorrow, it
should be offshore all except peninsular FL, where northerly surface
flow will develop on both sides (minimizing frontal lift). 

Through the period, the showery convective regime in the northern
Upper Great Lakes will evolve from one driven largely by steep lapse
rates -- compelled by post-frontal cold advection atop relatively
high theta-e of the near-lake-surface layer -- to a hybrid of that
with a warm-advection conveyor around the poleward sector of the
cyclonic shortwave circulation.  Forecast soundings periodically
have indicated CAPE (generally less than 200 J/kg) extending into
favorable icing layers for lightning for valid times up to now,
without lightning detected.  They continue to do so episodically
through tonight; however, weak overall lift and lack of stronger
inflow-layer theta-e also should continue to limit realization of
that potential.  While isolated flashes still cannot be ruled out,
overall coverage appears to be less than 10% for the period over the
region.

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not forecast across the contiguous United
States through tonight.

...Synopsis...
A mean mid-level trough will reside over the West and an anticyclone
will remain centered over FL.  Water-vapor imagery this evening
shows a weak disturbance moving east-northeast across the IA/WI
vicinity.  This mid to upper-level feature will continue into MI
tonight and into southeast Canada by early Saturday morning.  In the
low levels, a cold front over Lower MI extends south-southwest into
eastern IL and into central TX.  The northern portion of the front
will continue sweeping east across the central Great Lakes and parts
of the OH Valley.  A few thunderstorms will remain possible near the
front over the Midwest.  Weak buoyancy from the Mid South northward
into the Great Lakes (i.e., reference 00z area raobs) will likely
limit both storm coverage/intensity through the early morning.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0505 PM CDT Fri Oct 27 2023

Valid 291200Z - 041200Z

A deep upper trough is forecast to continue to amplify across the
West Coast trough this weekend. Strong flow aloft will overspread
much of the Western US as a cold front moves south out of Canada.
Building high pressure will allow for strong offshore winds to
develop late this weekend, supporting fire-weather concerns over
parts of CA into early next week.

...California...
As the upper trough continues to dive south over the West Coast,
strong mid-level flow will move over parts of southern CA and the
southwest through the weekend and into early next week. Surface high
pressure across the interior West and Great Basin will support an
offshore pressure gradient over much of southern CA. LAX to DAG
gradients around -4 to -7 mb will develop as early as D3/Sunday
morning, with hi-res guidance showing widespread winds of 25-40 mph
and locally higher gusts possible across parts of the LA Basin. With
the downslope trajectories, afternoon RH value should fall to the
low teens. The strong winds, low humidity, and somewhat receptive
fuels should support several hours of elevated to critical
fire-weather conditions D3/Sunday.

The strongest winds and resulting fire-weather concerns will linger
into D4/Monday as the upper trough slowly drifts off to the east.
Flow aloft and the strong offshore pressure gradient will quickly
weaken late D4/Monday into D5/Tuesday as the main trough shifts to
the east. While localized fire-weather concerns may linger into
midweek, the lack of stronger aloft should keep winds relatively
light and terrain focused.

Gusty northerly winds are also possible over parts of the central
Valley of northern CA D3/Sunday. The strong northerly flow will
gradually shift south and weaken as it moves toward southern CA
through the day. However, gusty downslope winds and lower humidity
may support a few hours of elevated to locally critical fire-weather
conditions before winds weaken and the air mass moderates into
D4/Monday.

The overall forecast pattern is expected to turn more zonal through
the remainder of the extended forecast period. A much colder air
mass and broad area of precipitation should keep fire-weather
concerns low over much of the central CONUS. Gusty winds may linger
over parts of the Southwest where little precipitation is expected.
However, confidence in widespread fire-weather conditions is low
through next week.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1155 PM CDT Tue Oct 24 2023

Valid 261200Z - 271200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
The strong trough in the Great Basin will eject into the central
Plains late on Thursday. A strong lee cyclone will develop during
mid to late afternoon near the CO/KS border. Areas of stronger
surface winds are possible within the lee of the Rockies in
southeastern Colorado as well as northeast New Mexico into the Texas
Panhandle. Fuels appear most receptive to fire within southeast
Colorado. Given the position of the surface low, the strongest winds
are likely to remain within and near terrain features where RH will
most likely be a bit higher than in the Plains to the east. Farther
south, RH below 20% is less certain and there is some potential for
precipitation to further reduce marginal fuel receptiveness.
Overall, fire weather concerns are expected to remain locally
elevated as a result.

0348 AM CDT Mon Oct 23 2023

Valid 261200Z - 311200Z

...DISCUSSION...
Thunderstorm activity will likely persist across parts of the
southern/central Plains toward the Mid-MS Valley through Day 6/Sat.
This activity will be aided by a prevailing moderate southwesterly
flow regime as a large-scale trough slowly digs across the western
U.S. while a pronounced upper ridge is maintained across the
Southeast and Atlantic coast.

A weakening upper shortwave trough over the southern Plains will
lift northeast across the Mid-MS Valley to the upper Great Lakes on
Day 4/Thu. This may focus some low-end potential for a few strong
storms. However, destabilization is likely to remain limited due to
widespread cloudiness and precipitation. By Days 5-6/Fri-Sat, a cold
front will sag southeast across parts of the northern/central Plains
into the Upper Midwest. Meanwhile stronger lee cyclogenesis is
possible over the central/southern High plains as the western trough
begins to shift east. This may support some potential for strong
storms across the southern Plains vicinity by Day 6/Sat, but how
much destabilization can occur and overlap with favorable shear and
strong ascent remains too uncertain to include probabilities. 

By the end of the period, the western upper trough will spread east
into the Plains and a strong cold front will surge east across the
central CONUS, limiting severe potential as boundary-layer moisture
become confined to the Gulf Coast states.

Valid 231200Z - 241200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected on Monday.

...Synopsis...

An upper shortwave trough migrating through broader upper ridging
centered over the Midwest will lift northeast from MN/IA through the
upper Great Lakes and into southern Ontario on Monday. Isolated
showers and thunderstorms may be ongoing at the beginning of the
period in association with this feature across IA/MN/WI. This
activity will shift east into MI during the afternoon/evening. Poor
surface heating and weak lapse rates will limit destabilization, and
severe storms are not expected.

Further west, an upper trough over the Great Basin/CA will develop
east/southeast across the western states through early Tuesday
morning. As this occurs, modestly enhanced southwesterly deep-layer
flow is forecast across the southern Plains. Southerly low-level
winds will support northward transport of Gulf moisture, and a
tongue of low/mid 60s F surface dewpoints are expected across much
of TX/OK into the Mid-MO Valley. Despite increasing moisture in
TX/OK, somewhat warm midlevel temperatures will lead to poor lapse
rates, precluding stronger instability. A shortwave impulse
migrating through southwesterly flow ahead of the western trough
will support shower and thunderstorm development, especially from
west-central into north TX and southern OK. However, severe
potential appears limited.

low-level flow will strengthen across the central Great Plains in
response to a low amplitude mid-level disturbance moving east from
CO/WY into the lower to mid MO Valley by mid evening.  The northern
rim of appreciable low-level moisture will reside across the
northwest Gulf Coast this morning with a narrow plume of modest
moisture advecting northward during the day.  A few weak elevated
thunderstorms are forecast to develop in an area centered on IA
overnight.  Elsewhere, widely scattered showers and isolated
thunderstorms are possible over the Great Basin northward into the
northern Rockies.

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected on Tuesday.

...Synopsis...
An expansive continental polar surface high will shift eastward from
the southern Plains into the southern Appalachians, favoring
cool/dry boundary-layer conditions and limited thunderstorm
potential across much of the central/eastern CONUS. Farther west, a
shortwave trough will cross the northern Rockies/adjacent Plains,
while a related cold front sweeps east/southeastward across the
northern/central Plains. However, thunderstorms are not expected
given limited moisture/instability ahead of the front. 

Over parts of southeastern AZ, diurnal heating/steepening low-level
lapse rates beneath a plume of adequate midlevel moisture will yield
a weakly unstable air mass. While large-scale forcing for ascent
will be minimal, isolated diurnally driven thunderstorms are
possible during the afternoon/early evening given the adequate
instability and gradually eroding inhibition. Inverted-V
thermodynamic profiles could support locally strong gusts, though
the weak instability and lack of vertical shear should limit updraft
intensity.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 710
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
125 PM CDT Fri Oct 13 2023

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Central into southeast Iowa

* Effective this Friday afternoon and evening from 125 PM until
  800 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A few tornadoes possible
  Isolated damaging wind gusts to 60 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1 inch in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Scattered low-topped thunderstorms will form this
afternoon along a slow-moving front across central Iowa.  The storm
environment will favor of mix of multicells and some supercells
capable of producing a few tornadoes, along with isolated marginally
severe hail and wind gusts.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 35 statute miles
north and south of a line from 35 miles west northwest of Fort Dodge
IA to 30 miles south of Cedar Rapids IA. For a complete depiction of
the watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS
WOU0).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 1 inch. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 50 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 350. Mean
storm motion vector 18020.

Mesoscale Discussion 2250
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1212 PM CDT Fri Oct 13 2023

Areas affected...Parts of central IA

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 131712Z - 131845Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...A few brief tornadoes and isolated hail are possible this
afternoon.

DISCUSSION...A deep-layer cyclone currently centered near the IA/NE
border will move eastward across western/central this afternoon. A
surface front extends northeastward from the low into northwest IA,
then arcs southeastward across central IA into northern MO.
Widespread cloudiness is noted along/ahead of the front, though some
thinning and cloud breaks have recently developed across parts of
north-central and south-central IA. 

As pre-frontal temperatures warm through the 60s F within a modestly
moist boundary layer, MLCAPE will increase into the 300-700 J/kg
range. Weak convection has already developed in Pocahontas County,
with additional development expected by early/mid afternoon
southward along the frontal boundary. A band of storms is expected
to evolve by mid afternoon, with modestly favorable effective shear
(generally 30-35 kt) potentially supporting embedded supercell
structures, especially from central into south-central IA. 

A combination of modestly favorable low-level shear/SRH and ambient
vertical vorticity associated with the cyclone will support a threat
of a few brief tornadoes this afternoon, both within a
hybrid/marginal supercell environment across central/south-central
IA, and a landspout environment into parts of
north-central/northwest IA. Cool temperatures aloft may also support
isolated hail with the strongest storms. While coverage and
magnitude of the threat may remain relatively limited, tornado watch
issuance is possible this afternoon if confidence in the potential
for multiple tornadoes increases.
