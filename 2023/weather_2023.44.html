Systems:<br /> The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on
Tropical <br /> Storm Pilar, located a couple of hundred miles southwest
of the <br /> coast of El Salvador.<br /> <br /> Southwestern East
Pacific (EP93):<br /> An area of low pressure located about 1000 miles
south-southwest of <br /> the southern tip of the Baja California
peninsula continues to <br /> produce disorganized shower activity. This
system has not become <br /> any better organized since yesterday, and
environmental conditions <br /> are forecast to become increasingly
unfavorable for development <br /> during the next couple of days while

FL<br /> 800 PM EDT Mon Oct 30 2023<br /> <br /> For the North
Atlantic…Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br /> <br /> 1. Eastern
Caribbean Sea:<br /> A trough of low pressure over the eastern Caribbean
Sea is producing <br /> a large area of showers and thunderstorms that
is beginning to show <br /> signs of organization. This system is
expected to move westward <br /> during the next several days, and
environmental conditions appear <br /> conducive for additional
development. A tropical depression is <br /> likely to form by the
latter part of this week as the system enters <br /> the central or
southwestern Caribbean Sea. Regardless of <br /> development, this
system has the potential to produce heavy rains <br /> over portions of
Central America towards the end of this week. <br /> * Formation chance
through 48 hours…low…30 percent. <br /> * Formation chance through 7
days…high…70 percent.<br /> <br /> 2. Southwestern Atlantic Ocean
(AL96):<br /> Shower and thunderstorm activity has become minimal with a
<br /> well-defined area of low pressure about 80 miles east of the
<br /> northwestern Bahamas. This system is embedded in a region of very
<br /> dry mid-latitude air with strong upper-level winds, and
additional <br /> development of this system is no longer anticipated.
The system <br /> is forecast to turn slowly northward and then
northeastward by the <br /> middle part of this week.<br /> * Formation
chance through 48 hours…low…near 0 percent.<br /> * Formation chance
through 7 days…low…near 0 percent.<br /> <br /> Forecaster Papin<br />

SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Entire coast of El Salvador
* Pacific coast of Honduras including the Gulf of Fonseca
* Honduras/Nicaragua border southward to Puerto Sandino.
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, in this case within 36 hours.
 
Interests elsewhere along the Pacific coast of Nicaragua
and in southern Guatemala should monitor the progress of this
system.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 700 PM CDT (0000 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Pilar was
located near latitude 11.6 North, longitude 90.9 West.  Pilar is
moving toward the east-northeast near 5 mph (7 km/h) and this motion
is expected to continue through early Wednesday.  On the forecast
track, Pilar could be near the coast of El Salvador or Nicaragua
Tuesday through early Wednesday, though the core of the system is
expected to remain offshore.  The storm is forecast to move
west-southwestward away from land on Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Further strengthening is expected during the next day or so,
and Pilar could be near hurricane strength on Tuesday.  Weakening is
expected to begin on Wednesday and continue through Thursday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Pilar can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP4 and WMO header WTPZ44 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP4.shtml
 
RAINFALL: Pilar is expected to produce storm total rainfall of 5 to
10 inches, with local amounts to 15 inches, over portions of Central
America from El Salvador southward to Costa Rica through Wednesday.
This rainfall will produce flash and urban flooding, along with
mudslides in areas of higher terrain.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Pilar are expected to continue affecting
the Pacific coast of Central America during the next few days. These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions could begin in the Tropical
Storm Watch area early Tuesday.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1000 PM CDT.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0446 PM CDT Mon Oct 30 2023

Valid 011200Z - 071200Z

The upper-level pattern over the CONUS is forecast to become more
zonal through the week as upper troughing exits the East Coast and
weak ridging develops over the West. A cold, but very dry
post-frontal air mass over the central US will shift eastward toward
the Southeast supporting a risk for localized fire-weather concerns
through midweek. Otherwise winds are forecast to weaken suggesting
fire-weather concerns will remain localized through the remainder of
the extended forecast period.

..Southeast States...
The post-frontal air mass across parts of the Southeast and Gulf
coast should continue to dry as surface high pressure intensifies
over the central US. Offshore flow may occasionally reach 10-15 mph
though winds are forecast to slowly weaken into mid week. With the
air mass drying from a much cooler continental regime overnight
recoveries will be poor and afternoon RH values are expected to be
below 30% for much of the Southeast. Locally elevated fire-weather
conditions are possible through mid week given the lack of recent
rainfall and the drier/breezy winds expected. Surface high pressure
will then shift eastward centering over the Gulf Coast late this
weekend into next week. Winds should gradually wane to below 5 mph,
but unusually dry conditions will likely persist for a few days.
Thereafter, onshore flow will return, ending the risk for elevated
fire-weather conditions as humidity increases.

...Southern CA...
With high pressure over the central US and weak ridging building
over the Pacific coast, weak offshore flow is likely to persist over
parts of southern CA into this weekend. While not overly strong, the
dry downslope flow will support low afternoon RH and poor overnight
RH recoveries. The drying of local fuels and at least occasional
periods of gusty afternoon winds suggests locally elevated
fire-weather conditions are possible into this weekend.

..Southwest and Southern Plains...
With zonal flow aloft expected through the remainder of the week,
occasional gusty down slope winds are possible over parts of eastern
NM and the southern High Plains. Despite the increase in winds, a
cold air mass and recent precipitation suggest fuels are not overly
receptive to fire spread. Thus, while localized dry and windy
conditions are possible through this week, the threat for widespread
fire-weather concerns is low.

Tropical Storm Pilar Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP192023
400 PM CDT Mon Oct 30 2023
 
Pilar seems to have held somewhat steady this afternoon.  1-minute 
geostationary satellite visible imagery shows the low-level 
circulation beginning to be exposed just east of the deep convection 
as the central deep overcast gradually clears.  Recent microwave 
imagery revealed a decent curved band wrapping around the western 
and northern portions of the core.  Subjective and objective 
satellite intensity estimates range from 39-51 kt and the initial 
intensity is held at 45 kt, closest to the SAB T3.0/45 kt value.
 
The storm continues to move slowly east-northeastward.  Models 
generally agree on this motion, which should continue for the next 
day or so.  By Tuesday evening, Pilar is forecast to stall near the 
coast of El Salvador with the core of the storm offshore.  By 
Wednesday the storm is expected to turn west-southwestward, away 
from the coastline, in the flow of a building ridge over the western 
Caribbean and Central America.  The latest NHC track forecast is 
shifted slightly north of the previous prediction, largely due to 
the northward shift in the initial position.
 
Moderate east-southeasterly shear appears to be affecting Pilar.  
However, most of the model guidance indicates that the storm should 
steadily strengthen for the next day or so over the warm waters and 
in a moist airmass.  After 36 h, the deep-layer shear should 
increase which will likely induce a weakening trend. By days 3-5, 
the shear is expected to abate somewhat.  Once again, the long-range 
official intensity forecast has been increased slightly and is close 
to the various consensus aids.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Heavy rains from Pilar will produce flash and urban flooding,
along with mudslides in areas of higher terrain, near the Pacific
coast of Central America from El Salvador southward to Costa Rica
through Wednesday.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are possible beginning early Tuesday
along portions of the Pacific coast of El Salvador, Honduras, and
Nicaragua, where a Tropical Storm Watch remains in effect. Interests
elsewhere along the Pacific coast of Guatemala, and Nicaragua should
monitor the progress of this system as additional watches or
warnings could be needed later tonight.
 
3. Swells generated by Pilar will continue to affect the Pacific
coast of Central America during the next few days.  These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.

...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Areas of thunderstorms are not expected today.

...20Z Update...
No changes.

..Dean.. 10/30/2023

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1118 AM CDT Mon Oct 30 2023/

A broad upper trough is present today over the Great Lakes region,
while a secondary shortwave trough rotates into the area tonight. 
Warm lake temperatures and cold air aloft pose a risk of convective
showers in the lee of Lake Superior and Michigan.  However, forecast
soundings show a shallow unstable layer and only weak forcing. 
Therefore expect any lightning activity to remain below a 10%
coverage threshold.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0208 PM CDT Mon Oct 30 2023

Valid 311200Z - 011200Z

...Southern CA...
No changes have been made to the forecast across southern CA.
Offshore winds will gradually weaken and shift south through the
day. Low humidity will also persist, promoting elevated fire-weather
potential.

...Southeast...
Confidence has increased that greater coverage of elevated to
critical fire-weather conditions will likely develop within dry
post-frontal air mass along the central Gulf Coast and Southeast
Day2/Tuesday. While initial RH recoveries will be quite moist owing
to residual cloud cover through the morning, the much drier air mass
should result in 25-30% humidity for a few hours during the late
afternoon. Accompanying the drier air, breezy northerly winds are
expected to be sustained at 8-10 mph with locally higher gusts
possible. Some differences in model soundings with typical diurnal
mixing biases again cast some uncertainty on how widespread the
overlap of stronger winds and lower RH will be. However, given
prolonged drought over much of the region, area fuels near the 95th
percentile for ERC and dryness will favor elevated fire-weather
conditions through the forecast period. With the increased
confidence, the Elevated area was expanded southwestward into parts
of LA and across portions of central and Northern AL for the latest
guidance.

..Lyons.. 10/30/2023

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0158 AM CDT Mon Oct 30 2023/

...Synopsis...
A surface anticyclone, centered over the Plains states, should drift
eastward in tandem with an upper trough, resulting in the relaxing
of a surface pressure gradient through the day tomorrow (Tuesday).
Windy offshore conditions may continue across the higher terrain
surrounding Los Angeles tomorrow morning before tapering off during
the afternoon, with Elevated highlights introduced to address the
lingering wildfire-spread threat.

An approaching surface cold front may also promote northwesterly
