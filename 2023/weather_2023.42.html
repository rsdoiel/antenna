Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0733 PM CDT Thu Oct 19 2023

Valid 200100Z - 201200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
The risk of severe thunderstorms appears negligible across the U.S.
through tonight.

...01Z Update...
Scattered thunderstorm development has been increasing in a general
corridor near/southwest of Louisville KY into areas around the
Nashville TN vicinity.  This is in the wake of an initial mid-level
perturbation shifting from the lower Ohio Valley into the lower
Great Lakes, and ahead of another strengthening impulse forecast to
continue digging southeast of the Upper Midwest through the lower
Ohio and Tennessee Valleys by late tonight.  Aided by a narrow
corridor of modest low-level moistening, within a zone of enhanced
low-level warm advection, it appears that ongoing activity may
slowly spread eastward across portions of central Kentucky and
middle Tennessee through 03-05Z before diminishing.  Overnight,
additional thunderstorm development is possible as forcing for
ascent refocuses southeastward into the southern Appalachians
vicinity.  Despite the presence of at least modest shear, it still
appears that thermodynamic profiles characterized by only modest
steepening of lapse rates, coupled with the limited moisture return,
will minimize the risk for severe hail and/or wind.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0354 PM CDT Thu Oct 19 2023

Valid 211200Z - 271200Z

A surface cyclone will develop off the Northeast coast this weekend.
This will result in a large wind field with dry and breezy
conditions expected across much of the eastern CONUS. However, much
of this area will see precipitation in the next few days and fuels
remain moist. In addition, temperatures should be relatively cool.
Therefore, fire weather concerns should be minimal.

An extended period of dry weather across the Southwest and southern
Plains has started to dry fuels somewhat, but they likely will not
become critically dry before precipitation arrives toward the middle
of next week. Some increase in initial attack is possible as winds
strengthen ahead of an approaching trough next week, but given the
marginally dry relative humidity and marginally dry fuels, the
threat for large fires should remain muted.

0619 AM CDT Tue Oct 17 2023

Valid 171300Z - 181200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected today.

...Discussion...
Thunderstorm potential will be limited to two confined areas within
the CONUS. The northern extent of a Gulf of CA/Pacific coastal
Mexico lobe of higher PW values should support isolated
thunderstorms peaking in the late afternoon across southeast AZ to
perhaps as far north as the Mogollon Rim. Weak deep-layer shear and
surface temperature-dew point spreads in excess of 40 degrees may
foster pulse microbursts capable of locally gusts from 40-55 mph.

A shortwave trough over the southern Canadian Rockies will amplify
as it digs east-southeast into the northern Great Plains.
Strengthening ascent and moistening near 700 mb should yield scant
elevated buoyancy from late afternoon into this evening across
central ND to the Upper Red River Valley. Very isolated
thunderstorms may form within a developing band of elevated showers.
Separately, low-topped showers should also form within a
post-frontal regime centered on southeast MT and adjacent border
areas during the late afternoon to early evening. Shower downdrafts
will further enhance already strengthening gradient winds and likely
result in strong gusts over parts of the northern High Plains.
Models largely suggest only a sliver of buoyancy at most is
anticipated, but aggressive ones infer a low-probability threat of a
thunderstorm or two.

Valid 171200Z - 181200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected on Tuesday.

...Synopsis...
An expansive continental polar surface high will shift eastward from
the southern Plains into the southern Appalachians, favoring
cool/dry boundary-layer conditions and limited thunderstorm
potential across much of the central/eastern CONUS. Farther west, a
shortwave trough will cross the northern Rockies/adjacent Plains,
while a related cold front sweeps east/southeastward across the
northern/central Plains. However, thunderstorms are not expected
given limited moisture/instability ahead of the front. 

Over parts of southeastern AZ, diurnal heating/steepening low-level
lapse rates beneath a plume of adequate midlevel moisture will yield
a weakly unstable air mass. While large-scale forcing for ascent
will be minimal, isolated diurnally driven thunderstorms are
possible during the afternoon/early evening given the adequate
instability and gradually eroding inhibition. Inverted-V
thermodynamic profiles could support locally strong gusts, though
the weak instability and lack of vertical shear should limit updraft
intensity.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0141 AM CDT Mon Oct 16 2023/

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns will remain low across the CONUS today. A
shortwave will move across the Pacific Northwest, shifting the
western US ridge eastward across the Rockies. A trough across the
eastern US will continue to move eastward offshore. A few areas of
breezy westerly winds will be possible across southeastern Oregon
and southern Montana. Relative humidity will stay above Elevated or
Critical thresholds with moist fuels in place, keeping fire concerns
low.

1128 AM CDT Mon Oct 16 2023

Valid 161630Z - 171200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated lightning strikes are possible over parts of Washington
state and perhaps southeatern Arizona. However, severe thunderstorms
are not expected today and tonight.

A deep, mid-level, long-wave trough centered over the Atlantic Coast
is forecast to slowly weaken as it consolidates into a broader
mid-level low and moves offshore late in the forecast period. In the
wake of the large eastern US trough, northerly offshore flow and
cool temperatures will dominate the eastern 2/3rds of the CONUS,
limiting thunderstorm chances. To the west, transient mid-level
ridging over the Southwest will be suppressed and shift eastward
under the influence of an advancing shortwave trough along the
border of southern BC. Weak inland advection of a modified eastern
Pacific air mass across western and northern WA State may briefly
support destabilization sufficient for a few thunderstorms late this
afternoon into the early evening. However, scant buoyancy (less than
500 J/kg of MUCAPE) confined within the lowest few km, will limit
the potential for strong, organized and persistent updrafts capable
of more widespread lightning. A few lightning strikes are also
possible over portions of southeastern AZ where strong surface
heating and marginal moisture may support a brief thunderstorm.
However, coverage appears unlikely to reach 10% and no thunder area
will be included. With limited to negligible thunderstorm chances
for much of the country, severe storms are unlikely over the CONUS
today and tonight.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 710
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
125 PM CDT Fri Oct 13 2023

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Central into southeast Iowa

* Effective this Friday afternoon and evening from 125 PM until
  800 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A few tornadoes possible
  Isolated damaging wind gusts to 60 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1 inch in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Scattered low-topped thunderstorms will form this
afternoon along a slow-moving front across central Iowa.  The storm
environment will favor of mix of multicells and some supercells
capable of producing a few tornadoes, along with isolated marginally
severe hail and wind gusts.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 35 statute miles
north and south of a line from 35 miles west northwest of Fort Dodge
IA to 30 miles south of Cedar Rapids IA. For a complete depiction of
the watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS
WOU0).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 1 inch. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 50 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 350. Mean
storm motion vector 18020.

Mesoscale Discussion 2250
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1212 PM CDT Fri Oct 13 2023

Areas affected...Parts of central IA

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 131712Z - 131845Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...A few brief tornadoes and isolated hail are possible this
afternoon.

DISCUSSION...A deep-layer cyclone currently centered near the IA/NE
border will move eastward across western/central this afternoon. A
surface front extends northeastward from the low into northwest IA,
then arcs southeastward across central IA into northern MO.
Widespread cloudiness is noted along/ahead of the front, though some
thinning and cloud breaks have recently developed across parts of
north-central and south-central IA. 

As pre-frontal temperatures warm through the 60s F within a modestly
moist boundary layer, MLCAPE will increase into the 300-700 J/kg
range. Weak convection has already developed in Pocahontas County,
with additional development expected by early/mid afternoon
southward along the frontal boundary. A band of storms is expected
to evolve by mid afternoon, with modestly favorable effective shear
(generally 30-35 kt) potentially supporting embedded supercell
structures, especially from central into south-central IA. 

A combination of modestly favorable low-level shear/SRH and ambient
vertical vorticity associated with the cyclone will support a threat
of a few brief tornadoes this afternoon, both within a
hybrid/marginal supercell environment across central/south-central
IA, and a landspout environment into parts of
north-central/northwest IA. Cool temperatures aloft may also support
isolated hail with the strongest storms. While coverage and
magnitude of the threat may remain relatively limited, tornado watch
issuance is possible this afternoon if confidence in the potential
for multiple tornadoes increases.

Valid 141200Z - 151200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
The risk of fire spread will remain low across the CONUS on
Saturday. Building high pressure across the western US will keep
winds light where the driest air mass resides, within the
southwestern US and southern Plains on Saturday. Pockets of breezy
northwesterly flow will be possible across the central Plains and
the Great Lakes region. However, cooler temperatures will lead to
higher humidity and overall low risk of fire spread.
