<p>PALM SPRINGS, Calif. — <a name="_Hlk104554292" id="_Hlk104554292">The Bureau of Land Management will implement a temporary closure of</a> public lands from Jan. 25 – Feb. 3, 2024, in the Johnson Valley Off-Highway Vehicle Recreation Area, San Bernardino County, during the annual 2024 <a href="https://kingofthehammers.com/">King of the Hammers</a> desert race event. The race is authorized by a BLM Special Recreation Permit and the temporary closure is necessary to facilitate public safety and provide an enhanced recreation experience for event participants and spectators.</p>

<p>In 2022, the BLM <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/11/18/2022-25169/notice-of-temporary-annual-closure-on-public-lands-for-the-king-of-the-hammers-race-san-bernardino">approved a five-year public land closure</a> for ten days a year through 2027. Registered race spectators, participants, and race officials are exempt from the closure. Approximately 81,000 acres of the Johnson Valley Off-highway Vehicle Recreation Area will be temporarily closed to public use and approximately 46,000 acres will be available for public use during the event.</p>

<p>“The safety of everyone involved, from participants, staff and spectators is paramount for an event of this magnitude,” said BLM California Desert District Manager Shelly Lynch. “We encourage the public to recreate responsibly and cooperate with race officials and law enforcement officers to ensure a safe and enjoyable race.”</p>

<p>The temporary closure complies with the management plan for the area. Recreation areas nearby will remain open to the public, including the Ord-Rodman Limited Use Area and Stoddard Valley Off-highway Vehicle Area. Information and a map of the closure area for the 2024 race event will be posted at the main entry points into the Johnson Valley Off-Highway Vehicle Recreation Area and available for viewing at the BLM’s California Desert District Office and Barstow Field Office. Download a map of the closure <a href="https://www.blm.gov/sites/default/files/docs/2023-12/2024_KOH_Map_508.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p>The BLM encourages the public to recreate responsibly on public lands. Find additional tips for <a href="https://www.recreateresponsibly.org/">recreating responsibly</a> on public lands.

## Silver Reef Mining Town: Preserving Chinatown is a community effort

date: 2023-12-21, from: Bureau of Land Management, blog

<div class="field contact-block -title"><h1>Silver Reef Mining Town: Preserving Chinatown is a community effort</h1></div>
      




  

            <div class="field contact-block -body"><p style="margin-bottom:11px"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="line-height:107%"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">Historically, Silver Reef was a mining town with many support industries packing the town.  Its heyday would only last about 30 years, occupied from the 1870s to the early 1900s.  Silver Reef was home to around 1,500 people at its height and was one of the largest towns in Washington County. As a typical boomtown, Silver Reef grew as quickly as it dwindled down. Reduced operations continued through 1909, after which mining completely stopped, and livestock owners took their place. When the town was abandoned, neighboring town residents borrowed the leftover buildings and took the materials for their own use.</span></span></span></p>

Their story is an integral part in understanding the diversity of mining towns and the people who worked these mines. Research focused on the Chinese residents has not taken place until this November, when volunteers conducted a search for artifacts and remnants of their homes and businesses. Chris Merritt, Utah State Historic Preservation Officer, teamed up with the BLM Utah St. George Field Office and Cedar City Field Office, Utah Cultural Site Stewardship Program, Washington County, Dinosaur Discovery Site, Chinese Railroad Workers Descendants Association, <a>and</a> the Silver Reef Museum and held two public events which included identifying the neighborhood known as China Town and a workshop on artifact identification in Silver Reef.</span></span></span></p>

## BLM welcomes hikers to visit newly restored historic Punta Gorda Light Station

<p>ARCATA, Calif.  –  The Bureau of Land Management has completed restoration of the 114-year-old Punta Gorda Light Station overlooking the Pacific Coast along the Lost Coast Trail south of Eureka. The rehabilitation project was partially funded by $2.8 million received through the Great American Outdoors Act.</p>

<p>In addition to restoring the scenic quality of the two-story lighthouse and adjacent oil house, renovations included repairing railings and replacing a spiral stairway leading to the lighthouse lantern room and deck. The project was planned and supervised by a team of BLM Arcata Field Office staff members with expertise ranging from engineering to wildlife biology.</p>

<p>“A challenging aspect was completing the work without disturbing a colony of northern elephant seals and harbor seals protected by the Marine Mammal Protection Act,” said Paul Sever, manager of the BLM King Range National Conservation Area. “We had a four-month window of work time and monitored the seals constantly for any sign of disturbance. We were happy to see that the seals tolerated our project well.”</p>

<p>The light station, a beacon for ship navigation, was built in 1910. Its light was fueled by oil stored in the nearby and now-restored oil house. The station also included housing and other wooden structures. The light station was deactivated in 1951 and the Fresnel lens used to cast the lighthouse beam far out to sea was removed. The station was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.  </p>

<p>The light station is near the Mattole Trailhead at the north end of the King Range National Conservation Area, near the community of Petrolia. Hiking to the site requires planning and caution due to creek crossings, a trail section that is only passable at low tide, and the potential for unpredictably high waves. Information on day hiking to the site and backpacking the Lost Coast Trail safely is available from the BLM King Range Office at 707-986-5400.<br />

<p class="MsoBodyText">PALM SPRINGS, Calif. – <a name="_Hlk144204777" id="_Hlk144204777">The Bureau of Land Management is seeking public comment on new solar energy work in eastern Riverside County. If approved, the Sapphire Project could generate and store up to 117 megawatts of photovoltaic solar energy and deliver renewable electricity to the statewide transmission grid.</a></p>

<p>The project would include approximately 41 acres of public lands for access roads, facilities, and lines to transmit the power. The planned solar panel arrays, battery energy storage, and related facilities would sit on about 1,082 acres of adjoining private land.</p>

<p>“Clean energy remains a BLM top priority,” said California Desert District Manager Shelly Lynch.  “BLM-managed public lands offer a tremendous opportunity to advance solar technology, and we value public input in the process.” </p>

<p>The BLM plans to hold a public meeting on Monday, Jan. 8, from 5:30-7:30 p.m. at the Lake Tamarisk Golf Course Clubhouse (also known as the CSA Hall), located at 26251 Parkview Drive, in Desert Center. A virtual public meeting will be held via Zoom on Tuesday, Jan. 9, from 5:30-7:30 p.m. Please <a href="https://blm.zoomgov.com/webinar/register/WN_QUzqa0LjQvuA_316CrivDA#/registration">register in advance</a> to attend the virtual meeting.</p>

<p>During the 30-day public scoping period, the BLM will gather input that will help inform an environmental assessment considering the proposal. The comment period closes January 18, 2024. Written comments may be <a name="_Hlk149124639" id="_Hlk149124639">submitted through the “Participate Now” function at the </a><a href="https://eplanning.blm.gov/eplanning-ui/project/2030262/510">BLM National NEPA Register</a> (preferred), emailed to blm_ca_pssc_sapphire@blm.gov, or delivered to the Palm Springs – South Coast Field Office (Attn:  Sapphire Project) located at 1201 Bird Center Drive in Palm Springs, CA 92262.</p>

<p>The BLM manages vast stretches of public lands that have the potential to make significant contributions to the nation’s renewable energy portfolio. To promote the development of these energy sources, the BLM provides sites for environmentally sound development of renewable energy on public lands. The efficient deployment of renewable energy from our nation’s public lands is crucial in achieving the Biden-Harris administration’s goal of a carbon pollution-free power sector by 2035, as well as Congress’ direction in the Energy Act of 2020 to permit 25 gigawatts of solar, wind, and geothermal production on public lands no later than 2025.</p>

<p>For additional information, please contact Amanda Moore, Project Manager, at 503-930-4133.</p>

<p>During the long months of winter, sagebrush is the grouse's only source of food. Taller bushes <br />
shelter the birds from wind and weather, and offer cover that helps in evading <a href="https://www.blm.gov/blog/2022-07-27/sage-grouse-balance-predators">predators</a>.  </p>

<p>Birds that manage to gain weight during the winter months will be fit in the spring, when <br />
they will be pre-occupied with <a href="https://www.blm.gov/blog/2022-03-31/sage-grouse-springtime-lands-thousand-dances">mating activities</a> that burn energy and leave little time for eating.  </p>

<p>Sagebrush of <a href="https://www.blm.gov/blog/2022-02-04/more-numbers-evaluating-progress-sage-grouse-conservation">adequate height and density</a> also captures blowing snow, keeping precious <br />
moisture in the habitat. Spring melting will water the next round of growth for sagebrush,<br />
grasses and flowering plants.  </p>

With a commitment to improving conditions for greater sage-grouse, the BLM is <a href="https://www.blm.gov/blog/2022-01-14/2022-next-steps-greater-sage-grouse-conservation">evaluating the plans adopted in 2015</a> to manage sagebrush habitat on public lands. <a href="https://www.blm.gov/blog/2022-02-04/more-numbers-evaluating-progress-sage-grouse-conservation">Monitoring</a> data and new scientific information published since 2015 will help us determine whether there are other steps we should take to benefit sage-grouse and people across the West who rely on healthy sage-steppe lands. <br />
