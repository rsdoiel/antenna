## ARC Tip of the Week:

date: 2023-11-28, from: California Tech (Caltech Student Newspaper)

<p><em>Introduction:</em></p>
<p>In the dystopian world of Panem, where each choice defines destinies and the division between good and evil is blurred more often than not, &ldquo;The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes&rdquo; dives into the core conflicts present in the entire Hunger Games franchise. Themes of desperation, morality, and the human condition are revisited by diving into the origin story of the tyrannical President Coriolanus Snow, the originator of the state of the Games that we saw in the main franchise. For ASCIT’s annual free movie night held on November 19th, 2023, Caltech students were teleported into the world of the twelve districts and the Capitol to follow along as Coriolanus goes from ambitious student to cold-blooded manipulator.</p>

## Gayboys

date: 2023-11-28, from: California Tech (Caltech Student Newspaper)

<em>Editor’s note: This letter was emailed to the <em>Tech</em>’s business address with the subject line “Letter to the editor (okay to publish)” from one <a href="mailto:wlela@yahoo.com">wlela@yahoo.com</a>. The ‘yahoo.com’ should have been enough to justify deleting the email immediately. So should’ve the first sentence of the article. But upon googling the guy, and reading the first result: “Heterosexuals Organized for a Moral Environment (HOME) is an American pro-heterosexuality, anti-homosexuality organization founded by Wayne Lela and…”, I realized that this is far too funny not to publish. So without further ado, enjoy.</em>

## Movie review - ballad of songbirds and snakes

date: 2023-11-28, from: California Tech (Caltech Student Newspaper)

<em>Introduction:</em> In the dystopian world of Panem, where each choice defines destinies and the division between good and evil is blurred more often than not, &ldquo;The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes&rdquo; dives into the core conflicts present in the entire Hunger Games franchise. Themes of desperation, morality, and the human condition are revisited by diving into the origin story of the tyrannical President Coriolanus Snow, the originator of the state of the Games that we saw in the main franchise. For ASCIT’s annual free movie night held on November 19th, 2023, Caltech students were teleported into the world of the twelve districts and the Capitol to follow along as Coriolanus goes from ambitious student to cold-blooded manipulator.

## New Couches

The most fundamental tenet of a Caltech undergraduate education is training students to collaborate effectively in order to solve the most difficult problems in science and math today. And yet, the sanctity of every common lounge space in every undergraduate house, the home of collaboration, is at risk due to a recent renovation effort by the Housing Office.

Interhouse basketball just finished, and I would like to reflect on the season. Dabney showed up to a full 3 out of our 7 games and proudly lost all of them. Personally, I scored a whole one point for my team which is more than I ever could have imagined given basketball is my least favorite sport and I don’t actually know all the rules.

## The Honor Code is Falling Apart – We are the Solution.

date: 2023-11-28, from: California Tech (Caltech Student Newspaper)

Caltech Faculty members have begun reevaluating the relevance of the Honor Code in their classrooms because they are losing faith in the ability of the student body to fulfill their responsibilities to the Honor Code. Students are worried about the state of the Honor Code because they think they are the only ones following it, believing faculty and administrative offices on campus are not held accountable for honor code violations. The number of reports of honor code violations has been elevated since the 2015-16 academic year, but during the year of online learning, reports of honor code violations further increased to 3 to 4 times the baseline case load. While the number of reports of honor code violations has fallen to the 2015-16 level, the stress placed on the Board of Control pushed it to the verge of failure. The BoC system implemented almost 100 years ago was not built to process this high case load, not built to withstand the ire of distrustful members of the Caltech community, and not built to protect a community, who, whether due to disinterest, fear, or overworkedness, is in some part negligent of the implications and applications of the Honor Code.

## Vice President of Student Affairs Addresses Controversy Over Discontinuing Rotation Events

date: 2023-11-28, from: California Tech (Caltech Student Newspaper)

There has been a lot of buzz about the vague spectre of “admin” banning undergraduate house events, both during and outside Rotation this year. In continuing this discussion between tradition and inclusivity, the <em>Tech</em> interviewed Dr. Kevin Gilmartin, Vice President for Student Affairs, to get his perspective on the matter. Our conversation focused on two specific issues: Blacker Hovse’s Potato Cannon, and Ricketts Hovse’s Rotation Dinner Skits.
