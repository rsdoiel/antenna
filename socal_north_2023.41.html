possession came to be was fantastic. The director of this film, David
Gordon Green, has quite a good amount of experience in the horror world.
He was also the director of the reboot of “Halloween” in 2018,
“Halloween Kills” in 2021, and “Halloween Ends” in 2022. While it was

loan relief doesn’t ease the burden for borrowers</h2>
<p>date: 2023-10-11, from: PCC Courier (PCC Student Newspaper)</p>
<p>Last year, I woke up to the most surreal news when President Joe
Biden forgave my outstanding student loan debt and declared me almost
debt free. This week I was reminded that 6 out of 3 people decided that
was stupid and slapped me in the face with my debt again. Now after
three years of payments being paused, millions of Americans are coming
face to face with their student loans again, but some know their debt
will never be paid off. For college graduate …</p>

<p>date: 2023-10-11, from: PCC Courier (PCC Student Newspaper)</p>
<p>The Clery Act federally requires all colleges and universities to
record and publicize specific campus crime statistics and safety
policies. PCC’s Annual Campus Safety Report covers crimes reported on
the main, Foothill, Rosemead, and PCC’s Northwest campuses. This year’s
Annual Campus Safety Report shows nearly the same rate of low crime
since 2020, a trend consistent since 2016 even considering the recent
decrease in enrollment due to the pandemic.  Of reportable crimes, the
largest numbers are mostly property theft. In 2022 across all four
campuses, …</p>

really matter? These are the questions some singers and rappers in the
music industry have been getting asked from fans for years.   Mainstream
artists like Doja Cat, Lil Uzi Vert, and Playboi Carti took a mysterious
turn towards a “satanic” appeal that are displayed in their music,

</p>
<p>
<span class="first-letter">S</span>cience is a labor of love—love of
discovery, and love of pushing the limits of current human knowledge and
ability. As graduate student and postdoctoral workers at Caltech, we
nourish our cell culture lines on weekends, stay up all night observing
through telescopes, spend hours welding devices, and travel long
distances to study our world. We care deeply about our science, and we
want the best environment in which to do that science.
</p>
<p>
Some aspects of our environment support our ability to do strong
science, such as access to cutting-edge technologies, brilliant
colleagues, and compelling classes and seminars. Other factors hinder or
harm that ability, particularly for colleagues disadvantaged by our
current system: for example, wages that fall short of the cost-of-living
year-after-year, unexpected changes or cuts to our health insurance,
unsafe laboratory environments, and a history of institutional failures
to address
<a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/azeenghorayshi/ott-harassment-investigation" target="_blank">mistreatment
by faculty</a>. To address these issues and create the best environment
in which to do our science, graduate students and postdoctoral scholars
across the Institute are in support of forming a union
(<a href="https://caltechgpu.org/" target="_blank">known as Caltech
Graduate Researchers and Postdocs United, or C/GPU</a>). Unionization
will allow us to collectively bargain for better working conditions and
codify them in an enforceable contract.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, administrators leading Caltech are actively opposed to
graduate students and postdoctoral scholars forming a union. In an email
to graduate students in May 2023, Dean of Graduate Studies David Chan
<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KXukjDK-flgHf3GVaG3XydVXx1--mu0N/view" target="_blank">bluntly

a similar sentiment</a>, writing in March that unionization would alter
the “direct” and “collaborative” relationship between administrators and
students.
</p>
<p>
Why is Caltech against us unionizing? A union will better position us to
negotiate for the best conditions to do our science by challenging the
current power dynamic where Caltech administrators unilaterally control
all aspects of our working conditions. Case-in-point: year after year,
the Graduate Student Council has presented Caltech with data-driven,
explicit, well-formulated requests for stipend increases that meet the
rising costs of living. Each time, Caltech has given marginal increases.
Then, after the public debut of Caltech Grads and Postdocs United in
December 2022, Caltech announced a sudden $5,000 increase in the
graduate student stipend. In a message to faculty, Provost Tirrell
explained that this stipend increase would be funded
<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fKYRA3hDGrXhHxv6AK8Qd_F8x75NCVaf/view" target="_blank">without
impacting research budgets</a>. Despite years of pleading from the
Graduate Student Council, it took the specter of a union and a possible
shift in power to finally persuade Caltech to increase stipends, and
prove that they could do so without burdening lab funds. It is no wonder
that on May 10th, 2023 the Caltech Graduate Student Council
<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ax-s1AXrfOIom9NmvfHTAdtgDRpJIQrh/view" target="_blank">released
a statement</a> of support for C/GPU!
</p>
<p>
Caltech administrators have repeatedly sent graduate students and
postdoctoral scholars a link to a
<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OkiteVPXrsV45FCRvB5bHt51zpEwVGvw/view" target="_blank">website</a>
which provides supposedly unbiased “facts about, and resources for,
current discussions about the potential Caltech graduate student and
postdoctoral scholar unionization.” We were dismayed that much of the
information in Caltech’s “Know the Facts” page lacks evidence, and
worse, some of the “facts” are blatantly misleading. For example, they
provide an example where “if only 100 out of 500 eligible people vote,
51 voters would determine the outcome for all 500 people in the
bargaining unit, as well as future graduate students and postdocs”,
which would suggest that graduate student and postdoctoral scholar union
elections often have low (20%) participation. Twenty percent
participation is far lower than any graduate student worker and
postdoctoral scholar union election in recent history. Examples include
<a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/case/31-RC-308858" target="_blank">USC</a>,
<a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/case/05-RC-309139" target="_blank">Johns
Hopkins</a>, and
<a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/case/01-RC-305762" target="_blank">Yale</a>,
where union elections saw participation by 60%, 67%, and 63% of the
voting body, respectively, with over 90% voting in favor in all three
elections.
</p>
<p>
In fact, much of the language on Caltech’s webpage is similar to
anti-union webpages at other universities. Several of these institutions
have hired top-dollar law firms to prevent graduate students from
unionizing; Duke University
<a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/punching-in-grad-student-unions-face-duke-university-challenge-28" target="_blank">famously
funded</a> a legal campaign to
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2019/05/23/nlrb-revisit-ruling-that-granted-graduate-students-right-organize-employees/" target="_blank">challenge
the law</a> that
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2016/08/23/are-they-students-or-are-they-employees-nlrb-rules-that-graduate-students-are-employees/" target="_blank">graduate
students are workers</a> with the right to unionize. Curiously, large
sections of the Caltech administration’s webpage are identical to a page
about graduate student unionization
<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XOYyqEnLOyVh5WOJQ_Bpm68RsOSCAioK/view" target="_blank">published
by Duke</a>. Caltech graduate students and postdocs have taken the time
to research, fact-check, and write
<a href="https://caltechgpu.org/be-informed/" target="_blank">critical
clarifications</a> to Caltech’s “Know the Facts” webpage.

<p>
Graduate student and postdoctoral workers drive the research and
discovery happening at Caltech. We put all of our intellect (and most of
our waking hours) into the generation, analysis, interpretation and
dissemination of critical scientific advances. We do this work because
we love science and discovery, but at the same time many of us struggle
to pay for rent, healthcare, childcare, and international scholar visa
and legal fees. Some of us deal with unsupportive or abusive advisors,
and work in research settings with very real health hazards.
Unionization can address these challenges and enhance our ability to do
the scientific work that we love.
</p>
<p>
The undersigned graduate student workers and postdoctoral scholars have
collectively contributed over a century of research and teaching years
at Caltech. We have seen the serious hardships many fellow researchers
have faced while trying to do their science at Caltech. We came here to
work with and learn from Caltech’s world-class faculty, and we believe
that a union will allow us to achieve more together. Many faculty,
having once been junior researchers themselves, have expressed support
for graduate students and postdocs unionizing at Caltech. We advocate
not only for ourselves, but for all of our colleagues, especially those
in more vulnerable positions. With a union, we will have the ability to
bargain for long-overdue improvements and protections, such as:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Formal grievance procedures and third-party arbitration that puts
students and survivors first, similar to mechanisms that the
<a href="https://thetech.com/2022/02/03/unionize-students-first" target="_blank">graduate
student union at MIT</a> is fighting for and the
<a href="https://uaw5810.org/2022/10/03/major-victory-on-workplace-bullying-and-abuse/" target="_blank">unions
at UC have won</a>
</li>
<li>
Protections and rights for
<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/protests-uc-san-diego-agrees-not-fire-chinese-postdoc-raised-concerns-rcna43737" target="_blank">international
students and scholars</a>
</li>
<li>
Written, contractual stipend increases that reflect cost of living every
year for graduate students and postdocs
</li>
<li>
Guaranteed funding to transition away from toxic lab environments,
<a href="https://www.studentworkersofcolumbia.com/contract" target="_blank">conditions
that Columbia</a> academic workers recently won in their contract
</li>
<li>
Affordable health insurance and child care
</li>
</ul>
<p>
We have done our homework and made the decision that forming a union is
necessary to ensure that we and future scholars at Caltech are best
positioned to make discoveries that can positively change our world.

Transiting Los Angeles Podcast – #4: The First Buses</h2>
<p>date: 2023-05-02, from: Transiting Los Angeles</p>
<p>On this day exactly 100 years ago, the City of Los Angeles held an
election that resulted in the creation of the city’s first extensive bus
network. In this episode, John talks about the early history of LA’s
transit system and the strange events that led to the city’s first bus
system.</p>

<p>
From building approvals to sewage, Pepperdine University has a well
documented history of the struggle to build and grow the Malibu campus.
President Banowsky labeled this history the “Malibu Miracle” given the
challenges the school faced at every step. One little-known piece of
this story involves the government jurisdiction the University falls in.
Despite the […]

<p>date: 2023-04-04, from: Pepperdine Beacon (Pepperdine Student

<p>
Is “Christian Nationalism” Christian? Many observers of culture have
noted the rise of “Christian Nationalism” among conservative, American
Christians in recent years. This has provoked what can only be described
as an unfair characterization by many critics on the left, and some on
the right. Due to its primarily negative use of the left, Christian […]

<i>Young Juliet Drinkard with her parents in 1951.</i>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Juliet Drinkard has always loved history, so much so that at the age of
16, she entered an essay-writing competition to highlight a significant
African American in history. She chose mathematician and surveyor
Benjamin Banneker (1731-1806), won the contest, and was crowned Queen of
Los Angeles’ “Miss Negro History Week” in 1969.
</p>
<p>
Then there’s the tour she organized and scripted for a family reunion in
1986 large enough to fill two tour buses that caravanned through many of
Los Angeles’ historic areas, starting at Watts Towers, ending in
Hollywood, and of course allowing for a shopping stop at Santee Alley.
And although she moved out for years-long stretches, she still lives in
the huge South Central house she was raised in, purchased by her parents
in 1954, which she describes as “looking like a big ship.”
</p>
<p>
Although living in the home can be bittersweet now that her folks are
gone, she has special memories of eating family meals looking out of the
big picture windows of the breakfast room into the backyard at her
father’s lush garden, which she says was “like being in a professional
nursery.”

<i>The Drinkard Family Home. </i>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Juliet’s family home was built in 1910, like many of the other houses in
the neighborhood.  She describes her parents trying to modernize the
house, painting the dark wood white, removing the coffered ceilings and
some of the built-ins.  Juliet tried to convince her parents not to make
these renovations.  She says that “Even at 11, I liked looking at older
buildings,” both her own house and those of her relatives.  Juliet
especially likes the opportunities that participating in Conservancy
events offers to get inside of homes and other buildings that she
wouldn’t otherwise have access to. 
</p>
<p>
Her parents both moved to Los Angeles from the south, her mother from
Louisiana her father from Alabama.  Her father and his brother lived
with their uncle, who “bought a tiny house on a street called “Success”
in Compton,” notes Juliet.  Her parents met through an uncle on her
mother’s side; they dated for a year and got married, spending their
honeymoon night at the Clark Hotel on Central Avenue.  Juliet describes
the special experience of being able to visit the Clark Hotel in the
1980s.  
</p>
<p>
Juliet’s commitment to historic preservation intensified when she
started working in downtown Los Angeles in the 1970s.  “I went over to
see the Bunker Hill area, and learned that the Victorian-era homes had
been bulldozed.  I felt sick.  That area should have been preserved…
something should have been done,” she says, adding “It’s important –
that’s a part of the history of Los Angeles.”

<i>Newspaper clippings of 1969’s “Negro History Week” where 16-year-old
Juliet was named Queen.</i>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
With her passion for Los Angeles history, it was inevitable that Juliet
would find her way to the Los Angeles Conservancy as a member and
volunteer (her first assignment was the 2014 special tour We Heart
Garden Apartments).  She supports the organization “to make a difference
in preserving Los Angeles’ history.”  She loves to explore Los Angeles,
and take friends and visitors to many places around town, with a special
affection for historic locations.  She observes, “there’s so much to do
and see in our own hometown!”   
</p>
<p>
One of Juliet’s favorite historic places to visit is Frank Lloyd
Wright’s Hollyhock House.  She went to visit three times in a 7-year
period before Covid.  She said every time she went, she saw something
different, and just loved standing in the space and looking around to
get the feeling of the place. 
</p>
<p>
Two of her other favorite historic locations in L.A. are Union Station
and the Farmers Market, both formative places in her childhood that she
still loves to visit. She describes going to the Farmers Market in the
early 1960s as an 11 year old.  Her mother “worked for a lady whose
apartment overlooked the Farmers Market,” and one time her mom gave her
five dollars and let her explore the shops on her own.  She remembers
how exciting that was. “I bought a little box of pastel chalks for
$4.95,” which she says she still has to this day. 
</p>
<p>
She describes going to Union Station frequently with her parents when
she was young, “starting in the 1950s; relatives were always coming and
going.”  As a child, she would look through the window at the Fred
Harvey restaurant – she wanted to go in but never did.  It was a real
pleasure for her to volunteer when the L.A. Conservancy held an event to
celebrate the grand opening of the Imperial Western Brewing Company in
2018, in the former Fred Harvey restaurant space, which had sat empty
for decades.  She says, “My dream came true.  Over 60 years later, I’m
walking through the door, sitting and eating inside.” 
</p>
<p>
<i><b>Our sincere thanks to Juliet for sharing so many wonderful
memories and family photos.</b></i>

<i>Congratulations to the selected recipients of the L.A. Conservancy’s
Legacy Business Grant!</i> The five legacy businesses of the first round
of our $5,000 grants have been selected and we’re thrilled to introduce
them to you: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
88 Gifts Shop (1987) in L.A.’s Chinatown 
</li>
<li>
Candelas Guitars (1947) in Boyle Heights 
</li>
<li>
El Aguila Bakery (1973) in El Sereno  
</li>

Gardena Cinema (1976) in the City of Gardena 
</li>
<li>
SIKA (established in 1992) in Leimert Park

<p>
From an essential neighborhood shop selling everything from houseware
items to plants to a rare, affordable single-screen movie theatre, these
locally-owned businesses boast a combined age of more than <i>200
years</i> in operation in their neighborhoods and communities. They also
represent the essence of L.A.’s legacy businesses: long-standing
neighborhood anchors where people connect, memories are made, and a
sense of community is nourished. 
</p>
<p>
We hope that their stories demonstrate the value of longtime businesses
and that you hurry out to patronize their business in the very near
future!

</p>
<p>
 For over 30 years, the original location of 88 Gifts Shop (88 Gifts)
was at 711 North Broadway in BC Plaza. In 2020, owner Annie Ma was
forced to relocate her business to its present location. 
</p>
<p>
Ma’s shop sells housewares, plants, and a variety of Lunar New Year
gifts to neighborhood residents and tourists. Perhaps most notably, 88
Gifts sells Chinese-language newspapers to Chinatown’s elders, allowing
them to remain in touch with news events both here and abroad 
</p>
<p>
Still feeling the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, this grant
will make it possible to pay for rent increases and avoid another
relocation.

<p>
Brothers Porfirio and Candelario Delgado-Flores moved from Mexico to Los
Angeles in 1947 and brought with them a burgeoning music business that
specialized in custom guitar marking. The store’s clientele includes
famous artists like José Feliciano but it’s also a source of community
pride, giving back to Boyle Heights in many ways including the creation
of a 501c(3) nonprofit that provides free music lessons to local youth. 
</p>
<p>
After closing for months due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Candelas was
thankfully able to re-open but is still facing the residual effects of
the shutdown. The grant will go towards payroll for the business and
operating expenses.

El Aguila Bakery was established by Apolinar Casillas in 1973 and has
been a beloved fixture in L.A.’s El Sereno community ever since. With a
loyal, multi-generational clientele, El Aguila prides itself on its
authentic Mexican sweet breads, cakes, tamales, and so much more! The
bakery also supports the community by giving back to local institutions
such as the city, schools, and places of worship.  
</p>
<p>
But the bakery’s authentic flavors come at a cost. When ingredient
prices rose more than 200%, the bakery had to increase its prices,
causing sales to slump. This grant will allow them to cover increased

<h2>
<b>ABOUT THE GRANT PROGRAM</b> 
</h2>
<p>
When we first announced the grant program in November of 2022, it was
the culmination of more than two years of advocacy, dedicated to raising
awareness about the importance of legacy businesses throughout Los
Angeles County. 
</p>
<p>
Longtime businesses add to our rich history and culture. These community
anchors have long been one of the focal points of the Conservancy’s
work, from responding to threats of demolition to providing technical
assistance. We saved the original McDonald’s from demolition in the
’90s, brought funding for the rehabilitation of the Formosa Cafe’s
Pacific Electric Red Car, and rallied to designate Norms on La Cienega,
Tom Bergin’s on Fairfax, and Otomisan Japanese Restaurant in Boyle
Heights as Historic-Cultural Monuments (HCM). In late 2019, we proudly
launched a Legacy Business initiative to raise awareness about and
support for these important places in L.A. County. 
</p>
<p>
When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, we understood the immediate threat and
unthinkable challenges facing longtime business owners. Thanks to Wells
Fargo, we’ve been able to expand our legacy business initiative to
include a grant program. This grant provides $5,000 to ten (10) eligible
small businesses that have operated and contributed to their community’s
history and/or identity for at least 20 years and have less than 25
full-time employees. 
</p>
<p>
So far, the response has been overwhelming. Nearly 400 owners applied
for the first round of grants, making the task of choosing just five
winners almost seem impossible. Please join our Legacy Business Network
and follow us on social media to learn more about our winners and to
stay up-to-date on Round 2 of the L.A. Conservancy’s Legacy Business
Grant Program!

<span class="first-letter">E</span>very Friday, I run a Dungeons &amp;
Dragons adventure at my local game shop. It’s one of my favorite ways to
meet people outside of Caltech. Armed with bags of dice in every color
imaginable, I guide players through zany high-fantasy tales and lay out
puzzles for our team of intrepid heroes to solve.
</p>
<p>
But tonight’s D&amp;D session isn’t your standard lair-crawling,
monster-slashing module. Tonight, I’m running an adventure that doubles
as science outreach. I still have plenty of classic D&amp;D hijinks
planned, but as a battery chemist, I’ve put my own spin on the story.
I’ve written different types of real-world batteries into the game
mechanics, and I’ve plotted a tale that will show my players how those
batteries work as they use a battery-powered device to defeat this
week’s villain. As people start to join my table, introducing themselves
or chatting about their characters, I’m excited to see how they’ll
approach the science-themed adventure I’ve laid out.

<p>
My battery-based D&amp;D module was developed with the assistance of the
<a href="https://stemap.org/" target="_blank">STEM Ambassador
Program</a> (STEMAP), an outreach training program that helps scientists
design their own community engagement activities. I had a little
experience leading community outreach, though mainly through programs
developed by someone else. STEMAP taught me to design my own outreach
program, and their approach surprised me in its difference from the work
I’d done previously.
</p>
<p>
STEMAP prioritizes building trust between scientists and the community,
instead of a strict focus on teaching science. Rather than reaching out
to conventional places of learning like schools, libraries, or museums,
STEMAP encouraged us to look for places where science outreach doesn’t
usually happen, like game stores or tattoo parlors,
<a href="https://stemap.org/engagement-activities/" target="_blank">among
others</a>. Looking beyond the obvious venues allowed us to reach people
who don’t, or can’t, engage with science in those spaces. And instead of
showing up with a demonstration already planned out or with activity
kits already in hand, we spent time talking to leaders and
representatives of the focal group—the group we wanted to work
with—about the best way to present scientific material before we even
began planning our program.

<p>
This relationship-centered model seems simple, but it fosters an
empathic approach to outreach that seems to be lacking in the modern
scientific community. Too often, scientists fall into the trap of the
“<a href="https://smallpondscience.com/2020/01/18/the-deficit-model-of-science-communication/" target="_blank">deficit
model</a>”: the belief or assumption that skepticism of science stems
from a lack of scientific understanding, and that we do outreach to
teach science to people who lack scientific knowledge. But that approach
devalues the sociocultural factors that influence attitudes toward
science, ignores what people might already know about the topic from
their own lived experiences, and erases the group’s agency in deciding
how and why they want to learn more. The deficit model alienates people
whose
<a href="https://www.macleans.ca/society/how-western-science-is-finally-catching-up-to-indigenous-knowledge/" target="_blank">science
knowledge</a> draws from experiences outside of formal education, who
have historically been
<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/how-racism-in-healthcare-has-led-to-vaccine-hesitancy" target="_blank">undervalued</a>
by scientific institutions, or whose attitudes toward science stem from
deeply held
<a href="https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/2021-4-fall/feature/nimby-threat-renewable-energy" target="_blank">values</a>
and beliefs that are challenged by scientific advances. In contrast, a
more empathic, value sharing approach
<a href="https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/69/4/305/5369893" target="_blank">increases</a>
public interest in science and improves scientists’ connections to their
communities.
</p>

</div>
<p class="c-content__image-caption">
The deficit model sees scientific outreach as a didactic practice,
providing scientific knowledge where it was previously lacking. The
relationship-centered model recognizes and draws on the lived
experiences and existing knowledge of community members.
</p>
<p class="c-content__image-credit">
</p>
<p>
So how can we, as scientists, build authentic and trustworthy
relationships with the communities we want to reach? Below are a few
considerations that we can implement at any stage of the engagement
process.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Get to know your audience.</strong> When communicating our
science, trainees are encouraged to “consider your audience,” usually to
get us to think about our audience’s education level. Dig deeper.
Consider your audience’s interests, the tools and resources they have
(or need), and the knowledge or skills they might already have acquired
outside the school system. Use those interests, tools, and knowledge to
build common ground.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Talk to community leaders.</strong> Build your outreach and
engagement programs in collaboration with people who already know your
audience. Ask what the group wants to learn. Listen to, and learn from,
how they already engage with science. Spend time in the space you’ll be
occupying. Resist the urge to guess (or to assume you already know) what
your audience cares about or how they want to engage with the material.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Be your full self.</strong> Engage with your own community,
whether that community is built around shared identities, interests, or
values. That shared connection can be as deep or as frivolous as you
want it to be, but bonding over something important to both you and your
focal group builds trust and invites the public to see you as more than
just your lab coat. Building that trust is just as worthy and important
of a goal as sharing the science, and it will open doors to more
effective and long-lasting relationships with our communities.
</p>
<p>
I encountered a powerful example of these principles in action at a
conference in the summer of 2022. I met a researcher from South Africa
who was working with rural and tribal groups to find more
climate-friendly alternatives to coal mining. Her efforts weren’t
focused on educating those groups on climate change though; as she
explained, they already knew a lot about the effects of climate change
on agriculture from their own lived experiences. They understood the
science of climate change through a different lens, and they knew that
closing coal mines would help fight both climate change and
mining-related illness. But closing the mines would destroy the
economies of their mining towns. Rather than hammering home the negative
impacts of coal mining on the environment, her work focused on building
trust and open conversations with the residents of those towns to ensure
that alternatives to the coal mines would meet their economic and public
health needs.
</p>
<p>
These principles can be applied just as easily in less politically
charged situations, like classroom outreach or my battery D&amp;D
adventure. Though the stakes are much lower, there are clear parallels
in how our focal groups respond when given the freedom and agency to
direct their own engagement with a topic. When we approach outreach with
empathy and openness, we build stronger, more trustworthy relationships
with the communities we want to reach.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
As our party of heroes defeats their last imaginary foe, I look out
across the table at the smiling faces of a team that were strangers to
each other, and to me, not three hours before. Even if they don’t
remember a single thing about batteries, I’ve taken the first steps
towards building an outreach relationship based on trust and mutual
interest. I’ve shown that I’m more than just a scientist, and that I see
them as more than just people who don’t know about batteries. Building
trust through shared values might not be a typical focus during
outreach, but I’m hopeful that by prioritizing those relationships, we
can grow lasting, authentic, and impactful educational partnerships.

Sonya Kolowrat joined the Conservancy this year, and jumped in feet
first, participating in our Community Leadership Boot Camp and joining
the Last Remaining Seats committee. Development Director Liz Leshin
recently checked in with her. 
</p>
<p>
<b>LL: How did you learn about the L.A. Conservancy, and what compelled
you to join?</b>
</p>
<p>
SK: A few years ago, a friend and I were talking about Downtown LA and
all the stunning buildings there, the theaters in particular, and she
told me that her father-in-law (Herb Silverman) is a docent for the
Conservancy-led tours. That was my initial introduction to the
Conservancy.
</p>
<!-- more -->
<p>
I’ve also been exploring downtown a lot and recently started an
Instagram account dedicated to Los Angeles Terrazzo
(<a href="https://href.li/?https://www.instagram.com/losangelesterrazzo/" target="_blank"><span
class="citation"
data-cites="losangelesterrazzo">@losangelesterrazzo</span></a>), and
when I post about the amazing terrazzo I find, I try to research the
building and area, and nearly every time, I am led to the Conservancy
website. It was probably my obsession with the old theaters, and the
possibility of exploring inside of them that led me to join the
Conservancy
</p>
<p>
<b>LL: You participated in the Conservancy’s Community Leadership Boot
Camp this year; what did you get out of the experience</b>?
</p>
<p>
SK: I LOVED my Boot Camp experience! I learned so much – it’s hard to
even encapsulate. I learned about all the amazing resources and research
tools available. I know the process of landmarking a building and what
it takes to do that. I know what city agencies control what, and I know
that the Vista Hermosa neighborhood has way too many uncapped oil wells.
I made friends too! Most importantly, I learned about what I can do as a
citizen of Los Angeles to make my voice heard and help advocate to raise
awareness of historic spaces.
</p>
<p>
<b>LL: Which neighborhood do you live in?  And what do you think makes
it distinct?</b>
</p>
<p>
SK: I live in Eagle Rock. I love it for the community feel and I love
the location - this unique little pocket between the rest of LA and
Pasadena. It’s got two lovely main streets in Colorado Blvd and Eagle
Rock Blvd that are filled with really special independent retail shops
and restaurants that really seem to support each other. Of course we
have our literal Eagle Rock.
</p>
<p>
<b>LL: You also became a member of the Last Remaining Seats committee. 
What attracted you to that, and what is your favorite part of LRS?</b>
</p>
<p>
SK: Last Remaining Seats is such a special and magical series. I work in
the music industry, but I LOVE film and old theaters – the glamour they
hold, the golden age of cinema, and this is such a great merger of that.
</p>
<p>
I met Lia, the Conservancy’s volunteer coordinator at the in-person Boot
Camp meeting, and when we started chatting about the volunteer
opportunities I learned that I could volunteer on this committee, so I
did! It was great timing, and I can’t wait for the next season. I’ll be
at every screening, and part of the appeal for me was really just being
able to be inside these lovely spaces. A film I suggested will hopefully
be shown, and I’m really excited for the entire potential slate, TBA!
</p>
<p>
<b>LL: What case would you make to others for joining and supporting the
L.A. Conservancy?</b>
</p>
<p>
SK: If you love your city, it’s important to take an active role in its
upkeep. No matter the cause, one voice CAN make a difference. It can be
something as small as writing a letter. Los Angeles is unique, magical,
diverse and HUGE. There is a lot of work to be done, and it’s so
important to protect these spaces and neighborhoods. The saying “if
these walls could talk” really could define preservation in Los Angeles,
and I feel like the Conservancy is really working hard to make sure that
the future of LA also includes the past, and they can’t do it without
us!

<p>Since Jan. 2016, at least 30 stone fabricators in the Los Angeles
area have been diagnosed with an accelerated form of silicosis, an
incurable, and deadly, dust-related illness. The evidence suggests
silica-rich synthetic stone is to blame.</p>
