Attacking Iran’s nuclear program was always a risky move for Israel and
the U.S. Even with the most modern weaponry, there was no guarantee they
could destroy key nuclear components in underground bunkers or locate
all of the country’s enriched uranium. Now, Iran faces a pivotal choice
on what to do next.
