Lee, who searched for 50 years for the son she was forced to give up as a teenager, launched a campaign last week calling on Dublin to pass laws for the release of more than 60,000 adoption files held by the state, private adoption agencies and the Catholic Church.

Philomena Lee’s story of being forcibly separated from her toddler son

benefits clawed back if she accepts Ireland’s compensation package.
