      <p>The largest nurses’ strike in New York City history has reached its 10th day, as negotiations stall. Nearly 15,000 New York City nurses are fighting for a contract that includes higher pay, a staffing increase to manage patients, improved benefits and workplace protections against violence. Senator Bernie Sanders and Mayor Zohran Mamdani joined the picket line at Mount Sinai West Tuesday with the New York State Nurses Association. “This is a fight for our patients,” says Michelle Gonzalez, a nurse at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City, who notes one of the nurses’ priorities in contract negotiations “is to have ICE officers not be allowed into our facilities.”</p>

(date: 2026-01-20)
      <p>
      <p>Tensions are escalating between the United States and Europe after President Trump threatened to impose tariffs on eight European allies that oppose his push to take over Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of Denmark. Thousands took part in protests in Greenland and Denmark over the weekend to oppose Trump’s annexation threats.</p>
<p>Julie Rademacher, chair of Uagut, an organization for Greenlanders in Denmark, tells <em>Democracy Now!</em> that Trump’s rhetoric is a threat to everyone. “This is not only Greenland being attacked. This is democracy, freedom and the world order as we know it that’s being attacked.”</p>

(date: 2026-01-20)
      <p>
      <p>One month after the deadline set by Congress for the Justice Department to release all files on the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, the Trump administration has made available less than 1% of the files. This comes as President Trump has dramatically expanded immigration operations in Minnesota while attacking Venezuela, threatening to bomb Iran and maintaining that the United States will annex Greenland.</p>
<p>Trump’s campaign promised “that the files would be released, all of the files. Now, that’s not happened,” says legal expert Michele Goodwin, calling it a “travesty.”</p>

      <h1>"Not Above the Law": Law Prof. Michele Goodwin Decries Violent ICE Activity in Minnesota</h1>

(date: 2026-01-20)
      <p>
      <p>Federal agents carrying out the Trump administration’s sweeping immigration actions in Minnesota have been widely accused of using excessive force, arresting U.S. citizens, denying people access to legal counsel and other violations. Now President Trump has put 1,500 U.S. military troops on standby for possible deployment to Minnesota under the Insurrection Act, which would mark another major escalation in his attack on dissent.</p>
<p>“The federal government is not above the law,” says legal expert Michele Goodwin, who says the administration’s violent crackdown in Minnesota marks a “reversal” of how federal force was used during the civil rights movement to protect peaceful protest. “It’s quite horrific.”</p>

      <h1>ICE vs. People of Minnesota: A Special Report on Community Resistance to Trump's Militarized Crackdown</h1>

(date: 2026-01-20)
      <p>
      <p><em>Democracy Now!</em> producer John Hamilton reports from Minneapolis, where residents say ICE agents are violently targeting legal observers and community members as part of the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigrants. Patty O’Keefe, who was arrested while monitoring ICE activity in her vehicle, said agents “broke our two front windows and dragged us out,” then taunted her in custody. She said one agent told her, “You guys got to stop obstructing us. That’s why that lesbian bitch is dead,” referring to Renee Good, the mother of three shot dead earlier this month by an ICE agent.</p>
<p>Indigenous residents have also been detained. “Nobody is more American than the American Indian,” Oglala Sioux attorney Chase Iron Eyes told <em>Democracy Now!</em>, adding ICE’s actions against Native Americans are “a legal impossibility.”</p>
<p>This comes as the Pentagon has placed 1,500 soldiers on standby for a possible deployment to Minnesota, just days after President Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act. The Trump administration has also reportedly opened criminal investigations into Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, all while declining to investigate Good’s killing.</p>

(date: 2026-01-19)
      <p>
      <p>Today is the federal holiday that honors Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. He was born January 15, 1929. He was assassinated April 4, 1968, at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee. He was just 39 years old. While Dr. King is primarily remembered as a civil rights leader, he also championed the cause of the poor and organized the Poor People’s Campaign to address issues of economic justice. Dr. King was also a fierce critic of U.S. foreign policy and the Vietnam War. We play his “Beyond Vietnam” speech, which he delivered at New York City’s Riverside Church on April 4, 1967, as well as his last speech, “I’ve Been to the Mountaintop,” that he gave on April 3, 1968, the night before he was assassinated.</p>

      <h1>Palestinian Activist Mahmoud Khalil Speaks Out as New Ruling Could Lead to His Rearrest, Deportation</h1>

(date: 2026-01-16)
      <p>
      <p>A federal appeals court on Thursday delivered the Trump administration a victory in its efforts to deport Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil, opening the door for his rearrest. Khalil was a graduate student at Columbia University when he was arrested in March and detained for months. He missed the birth of his son, Deen, while in detention. “The Trump administration is trying everything in its power to come after me, to put the full weight of the government to actually make an example out of me,” Khalil tells <em>Democracy Now!</em> “The U.S. government has not brought a shred of evidence that I broke any laws.”</p>
<p>The appeals court did not weigh in on the constitutional merits, instead saying Khalil should have appealed his removal order in immigration court before going to a federal judge. “What people need to understand is the immigration courts are not real courts,” says Baher Azmy, a member of Khalil’s legal team. “They’re part of the executive branch.”</p>

      <p>
      <p>Following Minneapolis protests in response to the ICE killing of Renee Good, President Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act Thursday, a move that would allow him to send military forces to the city. Trump’s comments came after a second person was shot by ICE following a traffic stop. “Trump probably sees this as a civil war,” says Baher Azmy, legal director for the Center for Constitutional Rights. “This, as we all know, is being leveraged as part of an autocratic power grab.”</p>

      <h1>"This Regime Will Fall": Director Jafar Panahi on Deadly Iran Protests & Filmmaking Under Censorship</h1>

(date: 2026-01-15)
      <p>
      <p>With Iran gripped by nationwide protests that activists say have left at least 2,600 people dead, we recently spoke with renowned Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi, whose latest film, <em>It Was Just an Accident</em>, was shot entirely in secret inside Iran and won the Palme d’Or at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival. The film has since been shortlisted for an Oscar in the international feature category. Panahi dedicated a recent New York Film Critics Circle Award to Iranian protesters.</p>
<p><em>It Was Just an Accident</em> centers on a group of former prisoners who kidnap a man they believe was their interrogator and grapple with whether to exact revenge, and Panahi says the film drew directly from his own experience with state violence and repression. Panahi has been repeatedly arrested in Iran, served prison sentences, and was recently sentenced in absentia to an additional year in prison and a two-year travel ban.</p>
<p>In an extended interview, Pahani discussed the protests in Iran, fighting against censorship, and the risk of prolonged cycles of violence. “I have always said this regime will fall. It is impossible for it to not fall, because it’s a failed state in every sense,” he said. “What I care about is the future of my country. I want the country to stand. I want there to be peace, and I want our children and the children of our children to not be facing bullets.” He was interpreted by Sheida Dayani.</p>

      <h1>FBI Raids Home of Washington Post Reporter as Attacks on Press Freedom Intensify Under Trump</h1>

(date: 2026-01-15)
      <p>
      <p>The FBI raided the home of <em>Washington Post</em> reporter Hannah Natanson this week and seized her electronic devices, part of a leak probe into a government contractor accused of mishandling classified government materials. Natanson has reported extensively on the Trump administration’s changes to the federal bureaucracy, including mass layoffs of government workers. This comes amid a broader pattern of attacks on the media, including lawsuits, funding cuts, and increasing media and technology consolidation.</p>
<p>“It’s hard not to see [the FBI raid] as an effort to intimidate not just journalists, but the sources that would communicate with them,” says Jameel Jaffer, director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University. “It’s a terrible time for press freedom. … We need the press to inform the public about the government’s actions and decisions and to help us hold government officials to account.”</p>

(date: 2026-01-15)
      <p>
      <p>The UN Security Council is meeting in New York in emergency session on Iran, amid escalating concern over reports that hundreds have been killed during weeks of nationwide anti-government protests. The meeting was requested by the United States. Demonstrations that began in late December, fuelled by soaring inflation, rising food prices and the collapse of the national currency, triggered a deadly and widespread crackdown with thousands injured and detained, according to numerous firsthand accounts. The UN has called for independent investigations into all killings and warned against the possible use of the death penalty against protesters.

      <h1>Supreme Court Appears Poised to Uphold State Bans on Trans Student Athletes</h1>

(date: 2026-01-14)
      <p>
      <p>When Becky Pepper-Jackson started middle school, she wanted to join her school’s track and field team. Like many girls her age, she was excited to make new friends and cultivate a passion for a sport. But unlike the other girls on her school’s track and field team, Pepper-Jackson is trans. And because she lives in West Virginia, a state which has banned transgender girls from participating in public school sports, Pepper-Jackson was excluded from what for her classmates is a normal childhood experience. Pepper-Jackson sued, and her case is now before the conservative-majority Supreme Court — which, after oral arguments Tuesday, appears likely to uphold similar laws throughout the country. “The states have attempted to justify these things in terms of some sort of alleged sex-based athletic advantage,” says Karen L. Loewy of the LGBTQ+ legal advocacy organization Lambda Legal. “It’s really about whether the court is going to uphold trans people’s equal opportunity in all aspects of public life.”</p>

      <h1>ICE Detention Expands Dramatically; 70,000 Immigrants Now Jailed, Deaths Increase</h1>

(date: 2026-01-14)
      <p>
      <p>A new report finds the number of people in ICE detention has nearly doubled in Trump’s first year back in office, driven by indiscriminate arrest policies that have locked up more and more people without criminal records, “an unprecedented situation for immigration detention.” We break down the numbers with Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, which published the report. Reichlin-Melnick explains that ICE’s annual budget has approximately quintupled, even as 2025 marked the agency’s deadliest year so far. Four more people have already died in detention in just the first two weeks of 2026. “Crucially, all of this has been slower than they wanted,” he adds. “Their hope was to have over 100,000 people in detention by today; they’ve hit 70,000.”</p>

      <h1>"ICE Is OK with Renee Good's Killing": Journalist Ken Klippenstein on ICE Tactics & Recruitment</h1>

(date: 2026-01-14)
      <p>
      <p>Reporter Ken Klippenstein’s latest investigation into the inner workings of the Trump regime finds that immigration enforcement agencies ICE and Border Patrol have relaxed recruitment and deployment guidelines in an effort to fill the administration’s sweeping deportation goals. “There’s splits within the agency about the shooting [of Renee Good] and the general mission,” says Klippenstein, whose reporting is based on leaked documents and interviews with officials from the Department of Homeland Security. Because “they’re worried about sending more experienced agents there who might not agree with the mission,” he explains, DHS is heavily recruiting volunteers with little vetting or training to carry out its deportation mandate. “They have more money than they know what to do with, and they need to fill those roles, and they’re doing everything they can to create them so that the actual personnel head count can match the resources that they now have.”</p>

      <h1>Journalist Tests ICE Recruitment; Surprised to Find Herself Hired with No Background Check</h1>

(date: 2026-01-14)
      <p>
      <p>“They didn’t ask very many questions.” Independent journalist and U.S. military veteran Laura Jedeed recounts how she was hired as a deportation officer by Immigration and Customs Enforcement after a six-minute interview at a job fair in Texas, despite never signing any paperwork, not having completed a background check, likely failing a drug test, and publicly sharing her opposition to the Trump administration and its anti-immigrant crackdown. “It seems like the answer to the question, 'Who are they hiring?' is: They don’t know.”</p>

      <h1>"Federal Invasion": Minnesota Officials Condemn Violent ICE Raids, Arrests</h1>

(date: 2026-01-14)
      <p>
      <p>Trump’s immigration enforcement surge continues to rock Minnesota, just a week after the ICE shooting of Renee Good, a mother of three and U.S. citizen in Minneapolis. <em>The Minnesota Star Tribune</em> reports that the number of federal agents now in Minneapolis and Saint Paul outstrips the 10 largest Twin Cities metro police departments combined. “We don’t want ICE in our neighborhoods. They are violent, they are creating chaos and terrorizing our immigrant neighbors, and they are not keeping anyone safe,” says vice president of the Saint Paul City Council, Hwa Jeong Kim, who comments on the city’s new lawsuit against the Trump administration, the loss of temporary protected status for thousands of Somali immigrants in the United States, plans for a general strike in Minneapolis and more.</p>

      <h1>"Empire in Decline": Historian Alfred McCoy on U.S. Aggression in Venezuela, Iran & Beyond</h1>

(date: 2026-01-13)
      <p>
      <p>As President Trump threatens Iran, Venezuela, Mexico, Greenland and more, renowned historian Alfred McCoy says the United States is “an empire in decline,” following a predictable pattern of militarism abroad and political instability at home as it loses power and influence on the world stage. “American politics become increasingly contorted and irrational,” says McCoy. “I think the thing to do is to realize that we are an empire in decline, … and it will continue for another decade or two, until American power finally slips away.”</p>
<p>McCoy just published his latest book, <em>Cold War on Five Continents: A Global History of Empire and Espionage</em>, on the impact of U.S.-Soviet imperial proxy wars in Africa, Asia and Latin America.</p>

      <h1>"State of Siege": Iran Protest Death Toll Rises to 2,000 After U.S. Sanctions Spawn Economic Crisis</h1>

(date: 2026-01-13)
      <p>
      <p>Iran has said it’s ready for “war” or dialogue after President Trump said the U.S. was considering “very strong options” to intervene if Iran’s security forces kill anti-government protesters in an ongoing crackdown. Vali Nasr, professor at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, says the U.S. “can wage full-scale war on Iran — which President Trump does not seem to be eager to do — or it can hope to squeeze Iran economically in order to create political unrest in Iran.”</p>
<p>This comes as at least 648 people have been killed since protests broke out in late December, according to the Norway-based group Iran Human Rights, and over 10,000 people have been arrested. Iranian officials say the number of dead could be as high as 2,000.</p>

(date: 2026-01-13)
      <p>
      <p>Activists in Los Angeles are demanding justice for Keith Porter Jr., an African American 43-year-old father of two, who was fatally shot by an off-duty ICE agent on New Year’s Eve. His family is demanding transparency in the investigation into his killing. “When he walked in, he brought joy,” says Porter’s cousin Jsané Tyler. “He always had a laugh, a joke, a smile.” Community organizers have called for the arrest of the ICE officer who killed Porter, but local government officials have reportedly told activists they have no intention of investigating Porter’s killer. “The community is going to have to mobilize,” says Melina Abdullah, co-founder of Black Lives Matter Los Angeles.</p>

      <h1>"All the Walls Came Down": L.A. Fire Survivors Fight Foreclosure & Demand Justice in Altadena</h1>

(date: 2026-01-12)
      <p>
      <p>We look at <em>All the Walls Came Down</em>, a new short documentary directed by filmmaker Ondi Timoner that looks back at the devastating 2025 fires in Los Angeles, which destroyed Timoner’s home and left the historically Black community of Altadena in ruins. The film, which has been shortlisted for an Academy Award, follows community organizer Heavenly Hughes as residents confront the aftermath of the fires and organize to rebuild their town.</p>
<p>“We feel like we’re being forced out because of this fire and not really getting the support that we need from our elected officials to be sure to preserve and protect our Black and Brown community,” says Hughes.</p>
<p>Timoner says Southern California Edison, which has taken responsibility for the Eaton Fire, has refused to tap its emergency funds. The utility company needs to “bridge families over so that they’re not pushed off their generational land,” Timoner says. “It’s an urgent situation in our town.”</p>

      <p>We speak with civil rights attorney Nekima Levy Armstrong in Minneapolis as protests continue in the city following the killing of activist Renee Good last week. The ICE agent who fatally shot Good in her car has been identified as Jonathan Ross, an Iraq War veteran described by family and friends as a hardcore conservative Christian and MAGA supporter. This comes as Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem continues to claim Good was engaged in “domestic terrorism.”</p>
<p>“Folks at the highest levels of government are perpetuating falsehoods … and working overtime to justify the brutal murder of Renee Good,” says Levy Armstrong, who urges local authorities to arrest Ross.</p>

      <h1>Iran Escalates Deadly Crackdown on Mass Protests as Trump Threatens to Launch Military Attack</h1>

(date: 2026-01-12)
      <p>
      <p>Hundreds of people have reportedly been killed in Iran as authorities crack down on protests against inflation and the government’s handling of the economic crisis, with thousands more arrested amid a nationwide communications blackout. The protests started in late December and quickly spread across the country, marking the strongest internal challenge to the Iranian government in years. Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to attack Iran in support of the protesters.</p>
<p>“Many civil and political activists in Iran have warned against any kind of foreign intervention, because it actually increases repression inside of the country,” says Narges Bajoghli, associate professor of Middle East studies at Johns Hopkins University.</p>
<p>We also speak with Iranian dissident Hamidreza Mohammadi, brother of the imprisoned Nobel laureate Narges Mohammadi. Speaking from Oslo, he says he has been unable to reach his family inside Iran since the start of the protests. “In the lack of internet and telephone communication, the regime has been able to kill a lot of people,” Mohammadi says. “People in Iran simply want [a] different system, and they don’t want to be enslaved by this regime for its ideological purposes.”</p>

(date: 2026-01-09)
      <p>
      <p>“Facts In, Facts Out”: An international campaign urges major AI companies to prioritize the credibility of information in their decision-making. Increasingly, people are using AI tools to access news, but these often come distorted or decontextualized compared to their original sources. Therefore, the media are calling for AI giants to take responsibility for their role in the digital revolution.</p>

      <h1>"Holding Liat": Former Israeli Hostage Says "There Aren't Any Conflicts That Are Unsolvable"</h1>

(date: 2026-01-09)
      <p>
      <p>Israeli American Liat Beinin Atzili was taken captive during the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack. Over the next two months, her family members, including film director Brandon Kramer, tirelessly advocated for her release, an endeavor now documented in Kramer’s new film, <em>Holding Liat</em>. We speak to Atzili and Kramer about their family’s ordeal and Atzili’s captivity in Gaza, where she was held in isolation alongside another Israeli woman by members of Hamas until November 2023. “They kept telling us that they had no idea what was going on with other hostages, and that it was their job to keep us safe and to keep us healthy until we were released in a hostage deal. And that’s what they did,” she says. Since her release, Atzili has become a fierce advocate for peace and reconciliation. “There aren’t any conflicts that are unsolvable. It’s just a matter of people wanting to speak to each other and wanting to listen and to understand each other’s stories,” she says. “If we don’t do that, we’re just allowing violence to take over.”</p>
<p><em>Holding Liat</em> premieres Friday, January 9, at Film Forum in New York, where <em>Democracy Now!</em> host Amy Goodman will <a href="https://filmforum.org/events/event/holding-liat-january-9">moderate a Q&amp;A</a> with Liat Atzili and director Brandon Kramer.</p>

      <h1>"The Voice of Hind Rajab," Shortlisted for Oscar, Uses Audio of 6-Year-Old Girl Killed in Gaza</h1>

(date: 2026-01-09)
      <p>
      <p>Two years ago this month, the world was gripped by a series of shocking recordings of a 6-year-old girl in Gaza pleading for help as she sat trapped in a car riddled with bullets alongside the bodies of her cousins, aunt and uncle, who had just been killed by Israeli forces as the family attempted to flee the Israeli ground invasion of Gaza City. Emergency responders with the Palestine Red Crescent Society attempted to secure safe passage to rescue the child, an elementary school student named Hind Rajab, but Israeli forces also targeted and destroyed an ambulance as it arrived on the scene, killing medical workers Yusuf al-Zeino and Ahmed al-Madhoun, before firing again at the family’s car, killing Rajab.</p>
<p>“When you hear her voice, you can’t unhear it,” says the award-winning Tunisian director Kaouther Ben Hania, whose new Oscar-shortlisted film, <em>The Voice of Hind Rajab</em>, incorporates recordings of Rajab’s emergency calls to depict responders’ race-against-the-clock attempt to save her — and the ultimate failure of the international community to prevent her violent death. Ben Hania says the film, a hybrid of documentary and drama, is an effort to “honor [Rajab’s] voice, but also to tell this incredible story of those heroes trying to save lives in impossible conditions.”</p>

      <h1>"What Are You Hiding?" Minnesota AG Keith Ellison Says ICE Killing of Renee Good Must Be Investigated</h1>

(date: 2026-01-09)
      <p>
      <p>Minnesota state investigators say the FBI is blocking them from investigating the ICE shooting of Renee Good, a mother of three and award-winning poet who was killed in her car on January 7. The federal government’s claims of immunity for the ICE officer — identified as Iraq War veteran Jonathan Ross — go against precedent, as does its refusal to cooperate with state authorities, says Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, who is demanding a local and state-led investigation into Good’s homicide and an end to the Trump administration’s “smear tactics” against Good. “This is Third Reich stuff,” adds Ellison, decrying the escalation in aggressive tactics employed by federal immigration officers in Minneapolis and throughout the country. “This is an unprecedented attack on American institutions.”</p>

      <p>U.S. forces have seized two more oil tankers with links to Venezuela, days after the U.S. attacked Venezuela and abducted President Nicolás Maduro along with his wife, making former Vice President Delcy Rodríguez the new leader of the country. “This is a decapitation without regime change,” says Venezuelan economist Francisco Rodríguez. “The political system in Venezuela remains intact.” In Caracas, former Venezuelan diplomat Carlos Ron says Maduro is a “prisoner of war” and that Venezuelans “are angry and are upset about this incursion from the United States.” This comes as the Trump administration has announced plans to control sales of Venezuela’s oil “indefinitely.”</p>

      <h1>"Terror & Chaos": Minneapolis Reels After ICE Agent Fatally Shoots Renee Good, Mother of 3</h1>

(date: 2026-01-08)
      <p>
      <p>We speak with two people who responded to the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, by an ICE agent in Minneapolis Wednesday. Trump administration officials claim the agent acted in self-defense, but local officials, including Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, reject that claim.</p>
<p>“This could happen to you in your city,” says Robin Wonsley, member of the Minneapolis City Council. “This happening here in Minneapolis sets a tone for this to play out in many other cities.”</p>
<p>The shooting comes after the Trump administration deployed over 2,000 ICE agents to Minnesota.</p>
<p>“This is not normal,” says Edwin Torres DeSantiago with the Immigrant Defense Network, which monitors ICE activity and has received thousands of requests from Minnesotans who want to volunteer as “constitutional observers” of ICE in Minneapolis. “We’ve been seeing people terrorized all over the state and all over the country under the guise of protection.”</p>

      <h1>"Firestorm": MS NOW's Jacob Soboroff on Anniversary of L.A. Fires & "America's New Age of Disaster"</h1>

(date: 2026-01-07)
      <p>
      <p>We speak with journalist Jacob Soboroff about his new book and ongoing reporting about the Los Angeles fires one year ago, when destructive infernos razed entire neighborhoods, killing 30 people and displacing over 100,000 more. The book <em>Firestorm: The Great Los Angeles Fires and America’s New Age of Disaster</em> provides a detailed look at how the fires unfolded, the emergency efforts and the political response. Soboroff, who grew up in the area, describes seeing the charred remains of his own childhood home while misinformation from Donald Trump, Elon Musk and other powerful figures was “pouring rhetorical fuel on the flames of the very real fire.”</p>

(date: 2026-01-07)
      <p>
      <p>Following the U.S. attack on Venezuela, the Trump administration has renewed its campaign to take over Greenland, which has been controlled by Denmark for more than 300 years. The White House says it’s considering “a range of options,” including the use of military force. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has warned that if the U.S. were to attack Greenland, it would spell the end of NATO.</p>
<p>“Greenland is not up for sale,” says Aaju Peter, a Greenlandic Inuit activist and attorney, who says Indigenous Greenlanders want their independence from both the U.S. and Denmark.</p>
<p>We also speak with analyst Pavel Devyatkin, who says the U.S. is “acting like a rogue state” and enacting a policy of “pure imperialism.”</p>

      <h1>"This Is Our Hemisphere": Report from Colombia on Trump's Escalating Threats to the Region</h1>

(date: 2026-01-07)
      <p>
      <p>Following his attack on Venezuela and the abduction of Nicolás Maduro, President Donald Trump has escalated his threats against Colombia and claimed without evidence that President Gustavo Petro is involved in cocaine trafficking. Trump and others in his administration have also threatened military action against Cuba, Greenland, Iran and Mexico in recent days.</p>
<p>Manuel Rozental, a Colombian physician and activist with more than 40 years of involvement in grassroots political organizing, tells <em>Democracy Now!</em> that Trump’s attacks on Petro are lies. The former guerrilla “has seized more cocaine than any other government in the past,” says Rozental. “President Petro is not a drug trafficker. President Petro has been a victim of drug mafias and their allies.”</p>

      <h1>Trump Family Businesses Rake in $4 Billion After His Reelection with Focus on AI, Crypto & Nuclear</h1>

(date: 2026-01-06)
      <p>
      <p>Ventures launched by the Trump family since Donald Trump’s reelection have generated at least $4 billion in proceeds and paper wealth for the Trump family. With investments across sectors like real estate, hospitality, media, cryptocurrency and more, the Trumps are “increasingly integrating their business empire” into the wider U.S. economy, says David Uberti, who has been reporting on the family’s self-enrichment for <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>. The coupling of Trump’s economic and political influence is raising major questions about conflicts of interest. “You have all of these different business interests in different areas in which the government regulates,” and this “proximity to power may help along some of these deals and the valuations at which they’re made.”</p>
<p>We look at the Trumps’ cryptocurrency venture World Liberty Financial and the Trump Organization’s planned $6 billion merger with a firm hoping to build a nuclear fusion plant to power AI data centers with Uberti, who says such “very speculative, highly risky corners of financial markets” are key to the family’s investment strategy.</p>

      <p>The share prices of U.S. oil companies surged following the Trump administration’s attack on Venezuela and abduction of its president, Nicolás Maduro. In public statements, Trump has been clear about his desire to reassert U.S. corporate control over Venezuela’s nationalized oil industry.

However, notes financial reporter David Uberti, it won’t be so easy for Wall Street to make a profit.

      <h1>"It's All About the Oil, Stupid!": Mehdi Hasan on Trump Attacking Venezuela & Kidnapping Maduro</h1>

(date: 2026-01-06)
      <p>
      <p><em>Zeteo</em>'s Mehdi Hasan outlines Donald Trump's “Donroe Doctrine,” a throwback foreign policy exemplified by the Trump administration’s shocking intervention in Venezuela. With his claims of U.S. sovereignty over nations in the Western Hemisphere, “Trump’s basically saying, 'Well, this is ours, and China, Russia can have their spheres of influence.' And it is very 19th-century-esque. ’Let’s divide up the world between the powers.’” This orientation is a major shift from U.S. foreign policy of recent decades, such as the 2003 invasion of Iraq, when interventionist actions were framed around ideological motivations, explains Hasan. “They said it was WMDs. They said it was democracy. They said it was al-Qaeda. They at least pretended that it wasn’t about the oil.” Meanwhile, Trump is brazen about his aims to seize control of Venezuela’s resources and demonstrate that “might is right.”</p>

      <h1>Trump "Just Wants Oil," Not Democracy: What's Next in Trump's War on Venezuela?</h1>

(date: 2026-01-05)
      <p>
      <p><em>Democracy Now!</em> discusses the attack on Venezuela with two Venezuelan American scholars: Alejandro Velasco, an associate history professor at New York University, and Miguel Tinker Salas, emeritus professor of history at Pomona College. The professors react to President Trump’s comments on the presence of oil in the region and claims that Venezuela had “stolen” oil from U.S. companies. “There was no taking of 'American property or American oil' — it was Venezuelan oil,” says Tinker Salas. “It belonged to Venezuela.”</p>
<p>Velasco also comments on Marco Rubio, a central figure in the U.S. campaign against Venezuela, who may have another country as his ultimate target. “Rubio’s primary interest in the region is not Venezuela, it’s not Colombia, it’s not Mexico — it’s Cuba,” says Velasco.</p>

      <h1>"Imperialist Intervention": Law Prof. David Cole on the Illegality of U.S. Attack on Venezuela</h1>

(date: 2026-01-05)
      <p>
      <p>The Trump administration did not seek congressional authorization prior to attacking Venezuela, as is required by the Constitution. It also violated “probably the first principle of international law … that countries have to respect their neighbors, and they can’t simply invade a neighbor or any other sovereign nation because they don’t like the way they are running things there,” says law professor David Cole. The attack was clearly not a law enforcement operation, as the administration has claimed, but an “imperialist intervention,” says Cole, who notes President Trump’s comments on extracting oil from the region.</p>

      <h1>"I Will Govern as a Democratic Socialist": Watch Zohran Mamdani & Bernie Sanders at NYC Inauguration</h1>

(date: 2026-01-02)
      <p>
      <p>Zohran Mamdani hailed “a new era” for New York on Thursday, promising in his inaugural address to deliver on the ambitious agenda that electrified progressives in the city and saw him defeat the political establishment in both the Democratic primary and the general election last year. Addressing thousands of supporters who braved freezing temperatures to attend the ceremony at City Hall, Mamdani vowed to “govern expansively and audaciously” for residents. “I was elected as a democratic socialist, and I will govern as a democratic socialist. I will not abandon my principles for fear of being deemed radical,” he said.</p>
<p>Mamdani was sworn in by Vermont independent Senator Bernie Sanders, who also spoke during the ceremony.</p>

      <p>“We have chosen courage over fear.

We feature part of her remarks, along with poet Cornelius Eady, who performed his original poem “Proof” during the inauguration ceremony, and Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, who began to cry as he addressed part of his speech to his younger self.</p>

      <p>Tens of thousands of New Yorkers braved freezing temperatures and police barricades to be part of Zohran Mamdani’s inauguration as mayor on New Year’s Day. <em>Democracy Now!</em> spoke with many Mamdani supporters, including a high school student and Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil, about what the day represented to them, their hopes for the new administration and how it could set a model for progressives across the country. “Organized people will always be more powerful than organized money,” said Diana Moreno, a fellow democratic socialist who is running for Mamdani’s vacant seat in the New York State Assembly.</p>

      <h1>Mamdani Takes Oath at Abandoned NYC Subway Station to Highlight Plan to Improve Public Transit</h1>

(date: 2026-01-02)
      <p>
      <p>New York City started 2026 with a new mayor, as democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani made history when he was sworn in as the city’s first Muslim, first South Asian and first African-born leader, as well as the youngest in over a century. Ahead of a public ceremony on New Year’s Day that drew tens of thousands of people in the freezing cold, Mamdani was privately sworn in at midnight by New York Attorney General Tish James in a small ceremony held at a decommissioned subway station below City Hall. He took his oath using two Qur’ans, including one that belonged to his grandfather. Andrew Epstein, one of Mamdani’s closest advisers, spoke with <em>Democracy Now!</em> about the significance of the private ceremony and how it connected the new mayor to the history of the city he now leads.</p>

Her reporting uncovered the exploitation of workers in Kenya, attempts to take massive amounts of freshwater from communities in Chile, along with numerous accounts of the technology’s detrimental impact on the environment. “This is an extraordinary type of AI development that is causing a lot of social, labor and environmental harms,” says Hao, in an extended interview.</p>
