      <h1>"I Will Govern as a Democratic Socialist": Watch Zohran Mamdani & Bernie Sanders at NYC Inauguration</h1>

(date: 2026-01-02)
      <p>
      <p>Zohran Mamdani hailed “a new era” for New York on Thursday, promising in his inaugural address to deliver on the ambitious agenda that electrified progressives in the city and saw him defeat the political establishment in both the Democratic primary and the general election last year. Addressing thousands of supporters who braved freezing temperatures to attend the ceremony at City Hall, Mamdani vowed to “govern expansively and audaciously” for residents. “I was elected as a democratic socialist, and I will govern as a democratic socialist. I will not abandon my principles for fear of being deemed radical,” he said.</p>
<p>Mamdani was sworn in by Vermont independent Senator Bernie Sanders, who also spoke during the ceremony.</p>

(date: 2026-01-02)
      <p>
      <p>New York City started 2026 with a new mayor, as democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani made history when he was sworn in as the city’s first Muslim, first South Asian and first African-born leader, as well as the youngest in over a century. Ahead of a public ceremony on New Year’s Day that drew tens of thousands of people in the freezing cold, Mamdani was privately sworn in at midnight by New York Attorney General Tish James in a small ceremony held at a decommissioned subway station below City Hall. He took his oath using two Qur’ans, including one that belonged to his grandfather. Andrew Epstein, one of Mamdani’s closest advisers, spoke with <em>Democracy Now!</em> about the significance of the private ceremony and how it connected the new mayor to the history of the city he now leads.</p>

Her reporting uncovered the exploitation of workers in Kenya, attempts to take massive amounts of freshwater from communities in Chile, along with numerous accounts of the technology’s detrimental impact on the environment. “This is an extraordinary type of AI development that is causing a lot of social, labor and environmental harms,” says Hao, in an extended interview.</p>

(date: 2025-12-31)
      <p>
      <p>A new report from the grassroots organization RootsAction aims to do what a promised “autopsy” from the Democratic National Committee ultimately did not: publicly reckon with the failures of the Democrats’ 2024 presidential campaign. While the Democratic Party’s official postmortem assessment was pulled from public release earlier this month, RootsAction’s “Democratic Autopsy” looks at how factors like “service to corporate power, hostility to the progressive wing of the party, out-of-control militarism [and] disconnection from the base of the working class” contributed to declining support for the party’s platform and candidates. “If you don’t examine real history, then you’re in a cycle that repeats the same problems,” says Norman Solomon, director of RootsAction, who joins <em>Democracy Now!</em> to discuss his organization’s findings.</p>

      <p>New York City is preparing to welcome Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist and member of the New York City Democratic Socialists of America, into office as mayor. Ahead of the highly anticipated inauguration, we sit down with NYC-DSA’s co-chair Grace Mausser to discuss the goals of the incoming administration and next steps for the volunteer-powered campaign apparatus that helped propel Mamdani to City Hall. “Just getting a mayor into office, while impressive and very exciting, is not enough,” says Mausser. “The reason we rallied behind Zohran is because he is committed to building our project.”</p>

(date: 2025-12-31)
      <p>
      <p>Israel is set to suspend the operating licenses of Doctors Without Borders, Oxfam and dozens of other humanitarian aid groups in Gaza and the West Bank over alleged ties to Hamas, preventing international aid workers from entering Gaza and carrying out critical, lifesaving operations. Israel’s licensing process is “arbitrary and highly politicized,” explains Shaina Low, communications adviser for the Norwegian Refugee Council, one of the impacted groups. “This is just one more step to push out principled humanitarian actors, particularly those that speak out on behalf of the people who we’re there to serve, call for accountability for rights violations and violations of international law.”</p>

(date: 2025-12-31)
      <p>
      <p>As the Trump administration escalates its military campaign against Venezuela, we speak to Venezuelan journalist Andreína Chávez about the latest developments. Responding to the U.S. military’s drone strikes on small boats and seizures of oil tankers off the coast of Venezuela, Chávez says U.S. claims of pursuing fentanyl traffickers lack evidence and are “pretext” for an attempt “to asphyxiate the Venezuelan economy” and wrest control of the country’s state-owned oil reserves. In the face of U.S. aggression, says Chávez, “Venezuelan communes and Venezuelan popular organizations in general have responded to Trump’s claims that he owns the Venezuelan oil with a very strong response, saying that they’re going to defend sovereignty, that they’re going to defend Venezuela’s self-determination.”</p>

(date: 2025-12-30)
      <p>
      <p>Tens of millions of Americans are set to see their health insurance costs soar when subsidies under the Affordable Care Act expire at the end of this year. Health insurance premiums are expected to more than double or even triple for some 20 million people, pricing many out of healthcare coverage entirely. “We’ve done nothing as a country to control healthcare costs,” says Elisabeth Benjamin, vice president of health initiatives at the Community Service Society of New York and member of New York Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani’s transition team. She discusses how premiums will work, how to seek help, what to watch for in alternative plans, and more.</p>

      <p>Starting in January, the Trump administration says it will garnish the wages of student loan borrowers who haven’t been able to make their payments for at least nine months. “It’s cruel and hostile to working people to turn the system on before we’re sure that we can run it in a compliant manner,” says Julia Barnard, higher education team lead at the Debt Collective and former student loan ombudsman at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. To student debtors facing financial hardship, Barnard suggests “immediately [contesting] when they get a notice of wage seizure.” She lays out what is at stake, options for those facing default, and more.</p>

      <h1>"Israel Crushed Mohammad Bakri": Gideon Levy & Rami Khouri on Death of Iconic Palestinian Filmmaker</h1>

(date: 2025-12-30)
      <p>
      <p>Journalists Gideon Levy and Rami Khouri discuss the work of acclaimed Palestinian actor and filmmaker Mohammad Bakri, who died at the age of 72 on Christmas Eve. He appeared in more than 40 films and directed documentaries highlighting the experiences of Palestinians living under occupation. “On a personal level, I can’t tell you how much I loved him,” says Levy. On one hand, Levy describes him as a “brave Palestinian patriot.” On the other hand, he was a victim of “Israeli machinery, which totally crushed his life and his career.” Bakri was best known for his 2002 documentary <em>Jenin, Jenin</em>, featuring the voices of Palestinians in the Jenin refugee camp following a devastating Israeli military operation that killed 52 Palestinians. The film is banned in Israel. “Literature, poetry, cinema, art, cooking — any creative work that Palestinians do that reflects their humanity and their attachment to their ancient land, the Israelis and the Zionist movement want to crush this,” adds Khouri.</p>

      <p>We speak to journalists Gideon Levy and Rami Khouri about President Trump’s meeting Monday with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu at Mar-a-Lago, where Trump supported Israel’s threats to launch new attacks on Iran and warned Hamas to disarm during the second stage of the U.S.-brokered ceasefire agreement. Khouri, a Palestinian American journalist, called the meeting a “continuation of the American-Israeli drive, that’s been going on for some years now, to reconfigure the Middle East … into a new colonial arrangement, whereby the U.S. and Israel dominate what goes on in the region.” Levy, Israeli journalist for <em>Haaretz</em>, called the meeting an “embarrassment,” noting that “Donald Trump presents himself as someone who promises the sky, who has no demands from Israel whatsoever.”</p>

      <h1>Cover-Up? New HBO Film Examines 2010 Immigrant Death Under Trump's Current Border Commissioner</h1>

(date: 2025-12-29)
      <p>
      <p>An HBO documentary, <em>Critical Incident: Death at the Border</em>, premieres tonight that examines the alleged cover-up of the murder of Anastasio Hernández Rojas, an undocumented Mexican immigrant who died while in U.S. custody at the border. His 2010 death occurred under the watch of Rodney Scott, the man who now heads Customs and Border Protection under President Trump. At the time, Scott was deputy chief of the San Diego sector of the Border Patrol.</p>
<p>“Anastasio was tortured and beaten to death in public,” says director Rick Rowley. “It was a killing and a cover-up that went absolutely to the top of the organization and implicated the entire chain of command.”</p>

      <h1>"Witch Hunt": Jailed U.K. Palestine Action Activists Continue Hunger Strike Despite Health Risks</h1>

(date: 2025-12-29)
      <p>
      <p>Alarm is growing over the treatment and deteriorating health of eight pro-Palestinian activists jailed in the United Kingdom who are on hunger strike to protest their detention. The activists remain imprisoned as they await trial over charges linked to their work with Palestine Action, which the British government has banned under its Terrorism Act over direct action protests against Israel’s treatment of Palestinians. Several of the activists who began their hunger strike in early November are now in “a critical stage” and facing grave health risks or death, according to Dr. James Smith, a doctor supporting the hunger strikers. “This is an extremely critical moment, and, frankly speaking, it defies comprehension that members of the government have refused even to meet with the hunger strikers in an attempt to resolve this situation.”</p>
<p>We also speak with Francesca Nadin, a spokesperson for Prisoners for Palestine, which is supporting the jailed activists. She says the harsh treatment of the hunger strikers is part of a “coordinated witch hunt that reflects the wider repression of the pro-Palestine movement” in the U.K. and around the world. “The people that have taken part in this hunger strike feel like they have no other choice left to them but to take this into their own hands,” Nadin says.</p>

      <h1>What's Behind Trump's Christmas Strikes on Nigeria? Anti-Christian Genocide or Appeasing MAGA Base?</h1>

(date: 2025-12-29)
      <p>
      <p>President Trump says the U.S. strikes in Nigeria on Christmas Day were aimed at ISIS fighters and part of a campaign to stop a supposed anti-Christian “genocide” in the country. But residents of the area say there is no recorded history of anti-Christian terrorism, and organizations monitoring violence in the region say there is no evidence to suggest that Christians are killed more than Muslims and other religious groups in Nigeria. This comes as a suicide bomber detonated an explosive inside a mosque in Nigeria’s Borno state on Christmas Day, killing five worshipers and injuring 35 more.</p>
<p>“Nigeria has a very serious problem of insecurity that affects a wide range of Nigerians, especially those who live in the more remote parts of the country,” but violence impacts “Muslims more so than Christians,” says Yinka Adegoke, Africa editor of <em>Semafor</em>. Adegoke says Trump’s religious framing has more to do with U.S. culture wars and appeasing his base of evangelicals than seriously reckoning with issues of poverty and violence in Nigeria, which he notes were exacerbated by U.S. cuts to foreign aid.</p>

      <p>The legendary journalist Bill Moyers died in June at the age of 91. Moyers, whose long career included helping found the Peace Corps and serving as press secretary for President Lyndon Johnson, was an award-winning champion of public television and independent media. We feature one of his numerous interviews on <em>Democracy Now!</em>, where we discussed the history of public broadcasting in the United States and the powerful role of money in corporate media. “The power of money trumps the power of democracy today, and I’m very worried about it,” he said in a 2011 interview.</p>

      <h1>A Tribute to Blacklisted Lyricist Yip Harburg: The Man Who Put the Rainbow in The Wizard of Oz</h1>

(date: 2025-12-25)
      <p>
      <p>His name might not be familiar to many, but his songs are sung by millions around the world. Today, we take a journey through the life and work of Yip Harburg, the Broadway lyricist who wrote such hits as “Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?” and who put the music into <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>, the movie that inspired the hit Broadway musical and now Hollywood blockbuster, <em>Wicked</em>. Born into poverty on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, Harburg always included a strong social and political component to his work, fighting racism and poverty. A lifelong socialist, Harburg was blacklisted and hounded throughout much of his life. We speak with Harburg’s son, Ernie Harburg, about the music and politics of his father. Then we take an in-depth look at <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>, and hear a medley of Harburg’s Broadway songs and the politics of the times in which they were created.</p>

(date: 2025-12-24)
      <p>
      <p>Calls are growing to release Palestinian protester Leqaa Kordia, who was arrested at a 2024 Columbia University Gaza solidarity protest. The charges were dismissed, but when she went to her ICE check-in this past March, she was arrested and immediately sent to the Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, Texas, where she has been held ever since. Although Columbia University student protesters like Mohsen Mahdawi and Mahmoud Khalil have been freed from ICE detention, “her case sort of fell between the cracks,” says Laila El-Haddad, Palestinian writer and journalist from Gaza, who just visited Kordia. El-Haddad also criticizes the Trump administration’s effort to “crack down on any dissent and use immigration law, to weaponize immigration law to silence dissent and to criminalize free speech, especially when that speech relates to Palestine.”</p>

(date: 2025-12-24)
      <p>
      <p><em>Democracy Now!</em> speaks with longtime immigrant rights activist Jeanette Vizguerra, who was just released Monday from ICE jail after nearly 10 months in a Colorado detention center. Vizguerra was ambushed by ICE agents during her work break in March. A judge ordered her detention was unconstitutional, and she was released on bond Monday. Vizguerra describes her time in detention and says she is “very emotional” and glad to be reunited with her children, and plans to keep fighting for her rights and for others. “Her detention was intentional to try and silence people across the country, not only immigrant leaders, but also citizens,” says Jennifer Piper, a supporter and program director for American Friends Service Committee Colorado.</p>

      <h1>"Heartbreaking": Journalist Vicky Ward on New Epstein Files & Survivors' Fight for Accountability</h1>

(date: 2025-12-24)
      <p>
      <p>As the DOJ releases the largest batch of files yet on the federal investigation into Epstein, we look at some of the most significant revelations with investigative journalist Vicky Ward, who has spent decades reporting on the deceased sexual predator, his powerful associates and the impact of his crimes. Survivors have condemned the Department of Justice for not complying with the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which required all files to be released last Friday. “I mean, that was the first indication of the contemptuous, cavalier attitude that has gone on inside this Justice Department,” says Ward. “It’s heartbreaking, frankly, to see these files being dribbled out.”</p>

      <h1>"Out for Blood": Writer Jasper Nathaniel on Surviving Israeli Settler Attack on W. Bank Olive Farmers</h1>

(date: 2025-12-23)
      <p>
      <p>We speak to independent journalist Jasper Nathaniel, who has recently returned from documenting Israeli settler and state violence against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank. Nathaniel describes being ambushed by settlers in October, on the first day of the olive harvest, in an attack that left one middle-aged Palestinian woman with a brain hemorrhage. “It was clear that this was a planned ambush,” says Nathaniel. “They were out for blood.” Earlier this week, the Israeli Cabinet approved 19 more settlements in the occupied West Bank. “What’s happening right now is these really violent settlers are going out into the fields. They’re stealing land from Palestinians,” explains Nathaniel. “[Then the government will] retroactively legalize the land that was stolen, and basically reward the violent settlers by giving them the stamp of state legitimacy.”</p>

      <h1>CBS Censorship: Bari Weiss Pulls "60 Minutes" Exposé on Torture of Migrants U.S. Sent to El Salvador</h1>

(date: 2025-12-23)
      <p>
      <p>The new head of CBS News, Bari Weiss, is facing accusations of censorship after she abruptly canceled a segment from Sunday’s episode of <em>60 Minutes</em> just three hours before broadcast. The segment centered on the stories of Venezuelan immigrants sent to El Salvador’s brutal CECOT prison by the Trump administration. “When so much of our ability to communicate out facts to the world is concentrated in a small number of people, and there’s a squeezing of independent media and the ability to get independent perspectives and voices out more broadly, I think we’re working with an information ecosystem that is highly dangerous,” says Alexa Koenig of the Human Rights Center at University of California, Berkeley. The center’s research on torture and other human rights violations at CECOT was to be featured in the segment.</p>

(date: 2025-12-22)
      <p>
      <p>Climate scientists and meteorologists are sounding the alarm after White House budget director Russell Vought announced the Trump administration will break up the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, known as NCAR. “He is executing the playbook of Project 2025,” says Michael Mann, scientist and co-author of <em>Science Under Siege</em>. Without NCAR, “we will not have the sorts of observational data and climate models that we need to inform climate policy.”</p>

(date: 2025-12-22)
      <p>
      <p>There’s been a sharp rise of illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank under Israel’s current far-right government. Israel’s Cabinet approved a proposal for the construction of 19 new Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank on Sunday. Amnesty International researcher Budour Hassan says the move “entrenches the apartheid system we’re seeing in the West Bank.” Experts warn that the settlements further threaten the possibility of creating a Palestinian state.</p>

(date: 2025-12-19)
      <p>
      <p>The Trump administration is ramping up efforts to strip more naturalized immigrants of their U.S. citizenship, with <em>The New York Times</em> reporting that officials are seeking 100 to 200 cases per month. The news comes less than two weeks after the Supreme Court agreed to hear a case to decide the constitutionality of President Trump’s executive order aiming to end birthright citizenship.</p>
<p>“During the first Trump administration, they had 25 [denaturalization] cases per year, and … for the 15 years before the first Trump administration, they had fewer than 15 cases per year,” says Mae Ngai, professor of Asian American studies and history at Columbia University. “So this is an incredible escalation.”</p>

      <h1>Kilmar Ábrego García Reunites with Family, But Trump Admin Threatens to Jail & Deport Him Again</h1>

(date: 2025-12-19)
      <p>
      <p>We get an update on the extraordinary case of Kilmar Ábrego García, the Maryland father who first made headlines in March when he was wrongfully deported to El Salvador and held in the notorious CECOT mega-prison. Ábrego García was returned to the United States after months of public outrage, but his ordeal continued as the Trump administration has threatened to deport him to Uganda, Eswatini and Liberia, despite having no ties to those African countries. Last week, a federal judge ordered him released from an ICE jail in Pennsylvania and blocked further arrests as a denial of due process.</p>
<p>Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, one of Ábrego García’s attorneys, says the administration’s actions are primarily meant “to punish him” for standing up for his rights. “It’s also about the government using him, more or less at random, to stand for the principle that they get to do whatever they want, whenever they want, to whomever they want — and, specifically, courts can’t stop them.”</p>

      <h1>Doctors in Jail? Hospitals Stripped of Fed Funding? The Criminalization of Trans Youth Healthcare</h1>

(date: 2025-12-19)
      <p>
      <p>The Trump administration on Thursday announced new measures to target hospitals and doctors providing care to trans youth. Under the new rules unveiled by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Dr. Mehmet Oz, who leads Medicaid and Medicare, the government would strip federal funding for any hospitals that provide pediatric gender-affirming care. The new rules were announced a day after the House of Representatives narrowly approved a bill that aims to criminalize providing gender-affirming medical care for any transgender person under 18 and subject providers to hefty fines and prison time.</p>
<p>“This is a drastic departure from any concern about science, concern about parents and their rights,” says Chase Strangio, co-director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s LGBTQ &amp; HIV Project. “It is putting hospitals in an impossible situation, and just another example of this administration undermining and threatening all of our health and welfare.”</p>
<p>We also speak with Dr. Jeffrey Birnbaum, a pediatrician and adolescent medicine specialist who works with transgender youth in New York City. He says the families he works with are “terrified right now,” but vows to continue his work. “I refuse to stop providing this care, knowing that I could potentially face 10 years in prison and a felony charge. I’m willing to go down that route, if necessary.”</p>

      <p>The paramilitary Rapid Support Forces in Sudan, backed by the United Arab Emirates, is accused of attempting to cover up its mass killings of civilians by burning and burying bodies, according to a new report by Yale’s Humanitarian Research Lab. This comes as drone strikes have plunged several cities into darkness, including Khartoum and the coastal city of Port Sudan. “We have the expansion of the war through Darfur, El Fasher, now Western Kordofan, which is an extremely important region economically. … And now we have this potential of the expansion of this war to South Sudan,” says Sudanese scholar Khalid Mustafa Medani. “We have a humanitarian crisis that has expanded, but we also have a military stalemate.”</p>

      <h1>Meet Tania Nemer, Fired Immigration Judge Suing Trump Admin Amid Purge of Immigration Court System</h1>

(date: 2025-12-18)
      <p>
      <p>Former immigration judge Tania Nemer, who was fired in February, is now suing the Trump administration, alleging that she was discriminated against despite strong performance reviews. Nemer is one of about 100 immigration judges who have been fired or reassigned since Trump took office. The system is notoriously backlogged, with more than 3 million cases pending. “I was pulled away in the middle of the hearing,” she says.</p>
<p>Nemer filed a discrimination complaint with the Department of Justice, which officials dismissed, citing Article II of the Constitution on presidential powers. “I’ve been practicing employment law and representing federal employees for almost 30 years, and I have never seen a federal agency dismiss a complaint for this reason,” says Nemer’s attorney, James Eisenmann.</p>

      <p>President Trump praised the state of the U.S. economy in a primetime address Wednesday evening, even though new government statistics show the nation’s unemployment rate is at a new four-year high of 4.6%. Dean Baker, senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, says Trump’s aides should be “wondering about the man’s sanity” after Wednesday’s speech. “This is utterly divorced from reality.” Though Trump blames former President Biden for the poor economy, Baker notes that Trump had inherited an “incredibly strong economy by almost every measure imaginable.”</p>

<p>Today, an in-depth look at puberty blockers and their use on minors with gender dysphoria. These drugs have come under an enormous amount of scrutiny in recent years, with some questioning their benefits, safety and long-term impact.

Azeen Ghorayshi is a science and gender reporter for the New York Times.
She’ll parse through what we know and don’t know about the effects of blockers in minors, how this became a hugely divisive and politicized debate around the world, and whether this new trial could change our understanding.
