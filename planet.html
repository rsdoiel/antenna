      A pair of Israeli strikes on a Gaza hospital killed five journalists and more than a dozen others, including first responders. Some of their deaths occurred on live television in what Israel called a "tragic mishap." This incident follows strikes that killed six journalists in Gaza City two weeks ago, the single deadliest day of the war for those covering it on the ground. Stephanie Sy reports.
