      <p>With a Motu Proprio, Pope Leo XIV has abrogated Article 8 n. 1 of the previous Fundamental Law of Vatican City State, which had allowed only cardinals to serve as president of the Commission, a position currently held by Sister Raffaella Petrini. The Pope, therefore, consolidates a change wanted by Francis and resolves an issue that had emerged due to increasingly “complex and pressing” governance needs.</p>

(date: 2025-11-20)
      <p>
      <p>Talks at the COP30 climate summit in Belém, Brazil, were suspended on Thursday after a fire broke out in the venue, triggering evacuations that halted negotiations between more than 190 delegations. The summit was set to conclude Friday, and the disruption came at a critical moment as countries were locked in tense debates over fossil fuels and climate finance. The outcome of these talks is widely seen as a litmus test for turning decades of climate pledges into concrete action.</p>

It was an interesting perspective given that the man who nominated him for a U.S. ambassador role, President Donald Trump, hasn't exactly been circumspect in talking about foreign elections.</p>

<p>When it comes to the Epstein files, there are solid reasons to withold certain information from the public, experts say. However, there are also grey areas that could cause disputes between lawmakers and the U.S. Department of Justice, and which could frustrate those seeking as much information as possible about the case.</p>

<p>The March 23, 1994, death of Luis Donaldo Colosio, a reformer on the cusp of winning the Mexican presidency who promised a more just and democratic country, holds a space in the country's consciousness like the 1963 killing of President John F. Kennedy does in the United States. Federal authorities in Mexico recently arrested a 64-year-old man in Tijuana in connection with Colosio’s killing.</p>

A Church that does not “lean” on the powerful nor confuse mission with religious marketing, but knows how to be leaven because it reflects the light of Another.</p>
