(date: 2026-01-09)
      <p>
      <p>“Facts In, Facts Out”: An international campaign urges major AI companies to prioritize the credibility of information in their decision-making. Increasingly, people are using AI tools to access news, but these often come distorted or decontextualized compared to their original sources. Therefore, the media are calling for AI giants to take responsibility for their role in the digital revolution.</p>

      <h1>"Holding Liat": Former Israeli Hostage Says "There Aren't Any Conflicts That Are Unsolvable"</h1>

(date: 2026-01-09)
      <p>
      <p>On October 7, 2023, Israeli American Liat Atzili was taken captive along with 250 others during Hamas’s attack on Kibbutz Nir Oz. Over the next two months, her family members, including film director Brandon Kramer, tirelessly advocated for her release, an endeavour now documented in Kramer’s new film, <em>Holding Liat</em>. We speak to Atzili and Kramer about their family’s ordeal and Atzili’s captivity in Gaza, where she was held in isolation alongside another Israeli woman by members of Hamas until November 2023. “They kept telling us that they had no idea what was going on with other hostages, and that it was their job to keep us safe and to keep us healthy until we were released in a hostage deal. And that’s what they did,” she says. Since her release, Atzili has become a fierce advocate for peace and reconciliation. “There aren’t any conflicts that are unsolvable. It’s just a matter of people wanting to speak to each other and wanting to listen and to understand each other’s stories,” she says. “If we don’t do that, we’re just allowing violence to take over.”</p>

      <h1>"The Voice of Hind Rajab," Shortlisted for Oscar, Uses Audio of 6-Year-Old Girl Killed in Gaza</h1>

(date: 2026-01-09)
      <p>
      <p>Two years ago this month, the world was gripped by a series of shocking recordings of a 6-year-old girl in Gaza pleading for help as she sat trapped in a car riddled with bullets alongside the bodies of her cousins, aunt and uncle, who had just been killed by Israeli forces as the family attempted to flee the Israeli ground invasion of Gaza City. Emergency responders with the Palestine Red Crescent Society attempted to secure safe passage to rescue the child, an elementary school student named Hind Rajab, but Israeli forces also targeted and destroyed an ambulance as it arrived on the scene, killing medical workers Yusuf al-Zeino and Ahmed al-Madhoun, before firing again at the family’s car, killing Rajab.</p>
<p>“When you hear her voice, you can’t unhear it,” says the award-winning Tunisian director Kaouther Ben Hania, whose new Oscar-shortlisted film, <em>The Voice of Hind Rajab</em>, incorporates recordings of Rajab’s emergency calls to depict responders’ race-against-the-clock attempt to save her — and the ultimate failure of the international community to prevent her violent death. Ben Hania says the film, a hybrid of documentary and drama, is an effort to “honor [Rajab’s] voice, but also to tell this incredible story of those heroes trying to save lives in impossible conditions.”</p>

      <h1>"What Are You Hiding?" Minnesota AG Keith Ellison Says ICE Killing of Renee Good Must Be Investigated</h1>

(date: 2026-01-09)
      <p>
      <p>Minnesota state investigators say the FBI is blocking them from investigating the ICE shooting of Renee Good, a mother of three and award-winning poet who was killed in her car on January 7. The federal government’s claims of immunity for the ICE officer — identified as Iraq War veteran Jonathan Ross — go against precedent, as does its refusal to cooperate with state authorities, says Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, who is demanding a local and state-led investigation into Good’s homicide and an end to the Trump administration’s “smear tactics” against Good. “This is Third Reich stuff,” adds Ellison, decrying the escalation in aggressive tactics employed by federal immigration officers in Minneapolis and throughout the country. “This is an unprecedented attack on American institutions.”</p>

      <p>U.S. forces have seized two more oil tankers with links to Venezuela, days after the U.S. attacked Venezuela and abducted President Nicolás Maduro along with his wife, making former Vice President Delcy Rodríguez the new leader of the country. “This is a decapitation without regime change,” says Venezuelan economist Francisco Rodríguez. “The political system in Venezuela remains intact.” In Caracas, former Venezuelan diplomat Carlos Ron says Maduro is a “prisoner of war” and that Venezuelans “are angry and are upset about this incursion from the United States.” This comes as the Trump administration has announced plans to control sales of Venezuela’s oil “indefinitely.”</p>

      <h1>"Terror & Chaos": Minneapolis Reels After ICE Agent Fatally Shoots Renee Good, Mother of 3</h1>

(date: 2026-01-08)
      <p>
      <p>We speak with two people who responded to the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, by an ICE agent in Minneapolis Wednesday. Trump administration officials claim the agent acted in self-defense, but local officials, including Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, reject that claim.</p>
<p>“This could happen to you in your city,” says Robin Wonsley, member of the Minneapolis City Council. “This happening here in Minneapolis sets a tone for this to play out in many other cities.”</p>
<p>The shooting comes after the Trump administration deployed over 2,000 ICE agents to Minnesota.</p>
<p>“This is not normal,” says Edwin Torres DeSantiago with the Immigrant Defense Network, which monitors ICE activity and has received thousands of requests from Minnesotans who want to volunteer as “constitutional observers” of ICE in Minneapolis. “We’ve been seeing people terrorized all over the state and all over the country under the guise of protection.”</p>

He thanked them for choosing two themes—synodality and mission in the light of Evangelii gaudium—from among four proposals, saying: “Thank you for this choice; the other themes are not lost. There are very concrete, specific issues that we still need to address.”</p>

      <p>We speak with journalist Jacob Soboroff about his new book and ongoing reporting about the Los Angeles fires one year ago, when destructive infernos razed entire neighborhoods, killing 30 people and displacing over 100,000 more. The book <em>Firestorm: The Great Los Angeles Fires and America’s New Age of Disaster</em> provides a detailed look at how the fires unfolded, the emergency efforts and the political response. Soboroff, who grew up in the area, describes seeing the charred remains of his own childhood home while misinformation from Donald Trump, Elon Musk and other powerful figures was “pouring rhetorical fuel on the flames of the very real fire.”</p>

      <h1>Trump's Plan to Seize Greenland Would "Militarize the Arctic," Trample Indigenous Rights</h1>

(date: 2026-01-07)
      <p>
      <p>Following the U.S. attack on Venezuela, the Trump administration has renewed its campaign to take over Greenland, which has been controlled by Denmark for more than 300 years. The White House says it’s considering “a range of options,” including the use of military force. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has warned that if the U.S. were to attack Greenland, it would spell the end of NATO.</p>
<p>“Greenland is not up for sale,” says Aaju Peter, a Greenlandic Inuit activist and attorney, who says Indigenous Greenlanders want their independence from both the U.S. and Denmark.</p>
<p>We also speak with analyst Pavel Devyatkin, who says the U.S. is “acting like a rogue state” and enacting a policy of “pure imperialism.”</p>

      <h1>"This Is Our Hemisphere": Report from Colombia on Trump's Escalating Threats to the Region</h1>

(date: 2026-01-07)
      <p>
      <p>Following his attack on Venezuela and the abduction of Nicolás Maduro, President Donald Trump has escalated his threats against Colombia and claimed without evidence that President Gustavo Petro is involved in cocaine trafficking. Trump and others in his administration have also threatened military action against Cuba, Greenland, Iran and Mexico in recent days.</p>
<p>Manuel Rozental, a Colombian physician and activist with more than 40 years of involvement in grassroots political organizing, tells <em>Democracy Now!</em> that Trump’s attacks on Petro are lies. The former guerrilla “has seized more cocaine than any other government in the past,” says Rozental. “President Petro is not a drug trafficker. President Petro has been a victim of drug mafias and their allies.”</p>

      <h1>Trump Family Businesses Rake in $4 Billion After His Reelection with Focus on AI, Crypto & Nuclear</h1>

(date: 2026-01-06)
      <p>
      <p>Ventures launched by the Trump family since Donald Trump’s reelection have generated at least $4 billion in proceeds and paper wealth for the Trump family. With investments across sectors like real estate, hospitality, media, cryptocurrency and more, the Trumps are “increasingly integrating their business empire” into the wider U.S. economy, says David Uberti, who has been reporting on the family’s self-enrichment for <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>. The coupling of Trump’s economic and political influence is raising major questions about conflicts of interest. “You have all of these different business interests in different areas in which the government regulates,” and this “proximity to power may help along some of these deals and the valuations at which they’re made.”</p>
<p>We look at the Trumps’ cryptocurrency venture World Liberty Financial and the Trump Organization’s planned $6 billion merger with a firm hoping to build a nuclear fusion plant to power AI data centers with Uberti, who says such “very speculative, highly risky corners of financial markets” are key to the family’s investment strategy.</p>

      <h1>Chevron Stocks Surge After Trump Vows to "Take Back" Venezuela's Oil After U.S. Attack</h1>

(date: 2026-01-06)
      <p>
      <p>The share prices of U.S. oil companies surged following the Trump administration’s attack on Venezuela and abduction of its president, Nicolás Maduro. In public statements, Trump has been clear about his desire to reassert U.S. corporate control over Venezuela’s nationalized oil industry. Now with Trump’s show of force over Venezuela’s political sovereignty, many investors see the potential for a similar overpowering of the socialist country’s economic independence. However, notes financial reporter David Uberti, it won’t be so easy for Wall Street to make a profit. In addition to upgrading Venezuela’s “decrepit” oil-producing infrastructure, “they have to push for more appetite for oil around the world.”</p>

      <h1>"It's All About the Oil, Stupid!": Mehdi Hasan on Trump Attacking Venezuela & Kidnapping Maduro</h1>

(date: 2026-01-06)
      <p>
      <p><em>Zeteo</em>'s Mehdi Hasan outlines Donald Trump's “Donroe Doctrine,” a throwback foreign policy exemplified by the Trump administration’s shocking intervention in Venezuela. With his claims of U.S. sovereignty over nations in the Western Hemisphere, “Trump’s basically saying, 'Well, this is ours, and China, Russia can have their spheres of influence.' And it is very 19th-century-esque. ’Let’s divide up the world between the powers.’” This orientation is a major shift from U.S. foreign policy of recent decades, such as the 2003 invasion of Iraq, when interventionist actions were framed around ideological motivations, explains Hasan. “They said it was WMDs. They said it was democracy. They said it was al-Qaeda. They at least pretended that it wasn’t about the oil.” Meanwhile, Trump is brazen about his aims to seize control of Venezuela’s resources and demonstrate that “might is right.”</p>

The professors react to President Trump’s comments on the presence of oil in the region and claims that Venezuela had “stolen” oil from U.S. companies. “There was no taking of 'American property or American oil' — it was Venezuelan oil,” says Tinker Salas. “It belonged to Venezuela.”</p>
<p>Velasco also comments on Marco Rubio, a central figure in the U.S. campaign against Venezuela, who may have another country as his ultimate target. “Rubio’s primary interest in the region is not Venezuela, it’s not Colombia, it’s not Mexico — it’s Cuba,” says Velasco.</p>

      <h1>"Imperialist Intervention": Law Prof. David Cole on the Illegality of U.S. Attack on Venezuela</h1>

(date: 2026-01-05)
      <p>
      <p>The Trump administration did not seek congressional authorization prior to attacking Venezuela, as is required by the Constitution. It also violated “probably the first principle of international law … that countries have to respect their neighbors, and they can’t simply invade a neighbor or any other sovereign nation because they don’t like the way they are running things there,” says law professor David Cole. The attack was clearly not a law enforcement operation, as the administration has claimed, but an “imperialist intervention,” says Cole, who notes President Trump’s comments on extracting oil from the region.</p>

(date: 2026-01-02)

      <p>Zohran Mamdani hailed “a new era” for New York on Thursday, promising in his inaugural address to deliver on the ambitious agenda that electrified progressives in the city and saw him defeat the political establishment in both the Democratic primary and the general election last year. Addressing thousands of supporters who braved freezing temperatures to attend the ceremony at City Hall, Mamdani vowed to “govern expansively and audaciously” for residents. “I was elected as a democratic socialist, and I will govern as a democratic socialist. I will not abandon my principles for fear of being deemed radical,” he said.</p>
<p>Mamdani was sworn in by Vermont independent Senator Bernie Sanders, who also spoke during the ceremony.</p>

      <h1>Zohran Mamdani Supporters Celebrate "Politics of Optimism" at His Inauguration</h1>

(date: 2026-01-02)
      <p>
      <p>Tens of thousands of New Yorkers braved freezing temperatures and police barricades to be part of Zohran Mamdani’s inauguration as mayor on New Year’s Day. <em>Democracy Now!</em> spoke with many Mamdani supporters, including a high school student and Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil, about what the day represented to them, their hopes for the new administration and how it could set a model for progressives across the country. “Organized people will always be more powerful than organized money,” said Diana Moreno, a fellow democratic socialist who is running for Mamdani’s vacant seat in the New York State Assembly.</p>

      <h1>Mamdani Takes Oath at Abandoned NYC Subway Station to Highlight Plan to Improve Public Transit</h1>

(date: 2026-01-02)
      <p>
      <p>New York City started 2026 with a new mayor, as democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani made history when he was sworn in as the city’s first Muslim, first South Asian and first African-born leader, as well as the youngest in over a century. Ahead of a public ceremony on New Year’s Day that drew tens of thousands of people in the freezing cold, Mamdani was privately sworn in at midnight by New York Attorney General Tish James in a small ceremony held at a decommissioned subway station below City Hall. He took his oath using two Qur’ans, including one that belonged to his grandfather. Andrew Epstein, one of Mamdani’s closest advisers, spoke with <em>Democracy Now!</em> about the significance of the private ceremony and how it connected the new mayor to the history of the city he now leads.</p>

Her reporting uncovered the exploitation of workers in Kenya, attempts to take massive amounts of freshwater from communities in Chile, along with numerous accounts of the technology’s detrimental impact on the environment. “This is an extraordinary type of AI development that is causing a lot of social, labor and environmental harms,” says Hao, in an extended interview.</p>

      <h1>Azerbaijan-Armenia peace plan hinges on narrow strip of land along Iran border</h1>

(date: 2025-12-31)
      <p>
      <p>President Trump has claimed to have solved eight conflicts since he began his second term. One of those is between Azerbaijan and Armenia, rivals since the collapse of the USSR, whose leaders met with Trump in the Oval Office this summer. Special correspondent Simon Ostrovsky and producer Katia Patin travelled to the Armenian border with Iran to assess whether that agreement could lead to peace.

All of this unfolds in the midst of the Jubilee Year of Hope, which is set to conclude on January 6. Let us take a look back at this Holy Year.</p>

(date: 2025-12-31)
      <p>
      <p>A new report from the grassroots organization RootsAction aims to do what a promised “autopsy” from the Democratic National Committee ultimately did not: publicly reckon with the failures of the Democrats’ 2024 presidential campaign. While the Democratic Party’s official postmortem assessment was pulled from public release earlier this month, RootsAction’s “Democratic Autopsy” looks at how factors like “service to corporate power, hostility to the progressive wing of the party, out-of-control militarism [and] disconnection from the base of the working class” contributed to declining support for the party’s platform and candidates. “If you don’t examine real history, then you’re in a cycle that repeats the same problems,” says Norman Solomon, director of RootsAction, who joins <em>Democracy Now!</em> to discuss his organization’s findings.</p>

      <p>New York City is preparing to welcome Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist and member of the New York City Democratic Socialists of America, into office as mayor. Ahead of the highly anticipated inauguration, we sit down with NYC-DSA’s co-chair Grace Mausser to discuss the goals of the incoming administration and next steps for the volunteer-powered campaign apparatus that helped propel Mamdani to City Hall. “Just getting a mayor into office, while impressive and very exciting, is not enough,” says Mausser. “The reason we rallied behind Zohran is because he is committed to building our project.”</p>

(date: 2025-12-31)
      <p>
      <p>Israel is set to suspend the operating licenses of Doctors Without Borders, Oxfam and dozens of other humanitarian aid groups in Gaza and the West Bank over alleged ties to Hamas, preventing international aid workers from entering Gaza and carrying out critical, lifesaving operations. Israel’s licensing process is “arbitrary and highly politicized,” explains Shaina Low, communications adviser for the Norwegian Refugee Council, one of the impacted groups. “This is just one more step to push out principled humanitarian actors, particularly those that speak out on behalf of the people who we’re there to serve, call for accountability for rights violations and violations of international law.”</p>

      <h1>U.S. Strikes Against Venezuela: Trump "Wants the Oil" as Grassroots Resist "Economic Asphyxiation"</h1>

(date: 2025-12-31)
      <p>
      <p>As the Trump administration escalates its military campaign against Venezuela, we speak to Venezuelan journalist Andreína Chávez about the latest developments. Responding to the U.S. military’s drone strikes on small boats and seizures of oil tankers off the coast of Venezuela, Chávez says U.S. claims of pursuing fentanyl traffickers lack evidence and are “pretext” for an attempt “to asphyxiate the Venezuelan economy” and wrest control of the country’s state-owned oil reserves. In the face of U.S. aggression, says Chávez, “Venezuelan communes and Venezuelan popular organizations in general have responded to Trump’s claims that he owns the Venezuelan oil with a very strong response, saying that they’re going to defend sovereignty, that they’re going to defend Venezuela’s self-determination.”</p>

      <p>
      <p>Reflecting on Pope Leo XIV’s first World Day of Peace message, Marie Dennis, the director of Pax Christi’s Catholic Institute for Nonviolence, highlights a vision of peace that is unarmed, disarming, humble, and persevering. In a world marked by fear and conflict, she points to Gospel nonviolence as a concrete, hopeful path already being lived in communities across the globe.</p>

      <h1>Over 20M Americans Set to Lose Healthcare Coverage Jan. 1 After Congress Goes on Recess</h1>

(date: 2025-12-30)
      <p>
      <p>Tens of millions of Americans are set to see their health insurance costs soar when subsidies under the Affordable Care Act expire at the end of this year. Health insurance premiums are expected to more than double or even triple for some 20 million people, pricing many out of healthcare coverage entirely. “We’ve done nothing as a country to control healthcare costs,” says Elisabeth Benjamin, vice president of health initiatives at the Community Service Society of New York and member of New York Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani’s transition team. She discusses how premiums will work, how to seek help, what to watch for in alternative plans, and more.</p>

(date: 2025-12-30)
      <p>
      <p>Starting in January, the Trump administration says it will garnish the wages of student loan borrowers who haven’t been able to make their payments for at least nine months. “It’s cruel and hostile to working people to turn the system on before we’re sure that we can run it in a compliant manner,” says Julia Barnard, higher education team lead at the Debt Collective and former student loan ombudsman at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. To student debtors facing financial hardship, Barnard suggests “immediately [contesting] when they get a notice of wage seizure.” She lays out what is at stake, options for those facing default, and more.</p>

      <h1>"Israel Crushed Mohammad Bakri": Gideon Levy & Rami Khouri on Death of Iconic Palestinian Filmmaker</h1>

(date: 2025-12-30)
      <p>
      <p>Journalists Gideon Levy and Rami Khouri discuss the work of acclaimed Palestinian actor and filmmaker Mohammad Bakri, who died at the age of 72 on Christmas Eve. He appeared in more than 40 films and directed documentaries highlighting the experiences of Palestinians living under occupation. “On a personal level, I can’t tell you how much I loved him,” says Levy. On one hand, Levy describes him as a “brave Palestinian patriot.” On the other hand, he was a victim of “Israeli machinery, which totally crushed his life and his career.” Bakri was best known for his 2002 documentary <em>Jenin, Jenin</em>, featuring the voices of Palestinians in the Jenin refugee camp following a devastating Israeli military operation that killed 52 Palestinians. The film is banned in Israel. “Literature, poetry, cinema, art, cooking — any creative work that Palestinians do that reflects their humanity and their attachment to their ancient land, the Israelis and the Zionist movement want to crush this,” adds Khouri.</p>

(date: 2025-12-30)
      <p>
      <p>We speak to journalists Gideon Levy and Rami Khouri about President Trump’s meeting Monday with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu at Mar-a-Lago, where Trump supported Israel’s threats to launch new attacks on Iran and warned Hamas to disarm during the second stage of the U.S.-brokered ceasefire agreement. Khouri, a Palestinian American journalist, called the meeting a “continuation of the American-Israeli drive, that’s been going on for some years now, to reconfigure the Middle East … into a new colonial arrangement, whereby the U.S. and Israel dominate what goes on in the region.” Levy, Israeli journalist for <em>Haaretz</em>, called the meeting an “embarrassment,” noting that “Donald Trump presents himself as someone who promises the sky, who has no demands from Israel whatsoever.”</p>

      <p>An HBO documentary, <em>Critical Incident: Death at the Border</em>, premieres tonight that examines the alleged cover-up of the murder of Anastasio Hernández Rojas, an undocumented Mexican immigrant who died while in U.S. custody at the border. His 2010 death occurred under the watch of Rodney Scott, the man who now heads Customs and Border Protection under President Trump. At the time, Scott was deputy chief of the San Diego sector of the Border Patrol.</p>
<p>“Anastasio was tortured and beaten to death in public,” says director Rick Rowley. “It was a killing and a cover-up that went absolutely to the top of the organization and implicated the entire chain of command.”</p>

      <p>Alarm is growing over the treatment and deteriorating health of eight pro-Palestinian activists jailed in the United Kingdom who are on hunger strike to protest their detention. The activists remain imprisoned as they await trial over charges linked to their work with Palestine Action, which the British government has banned under its Terrorism Act over direct action protests against Israel’s treatment of Palestinians. Several of the activists who began their hunger strike in early November are now in “a critical stage” and facing grave health risks or death, according to Dr. James Smith, a doctor supporting the hunger strikers. “This is an extremely critical moment, and, frankly speaking, it defies comprehension that members of the government have refused even to meet with the hunger strikers in an attempt to resolve this situation.”</p>
<p>We also speak with Francesca Nadin, a spokesperson for Prisoners for Palestine, which is supporting the jailed activists. She says the harsh treatment of the hunger strikers is part of a “coordinated witch hunt that reflects the wider repression of the pro-Palestine movement” in the U.K. and around the world. “The people that have taken part in this hunger strike feel like they have no other choice left to them but to take this into their own hands,” Nadin says.</p>

      <h1>What's Behind Trump's Christmas Strikes on Nigeria? Anti-Christian Genocide or Appeasing MAGA Base?</h1>

(date: 2025-12-29)
      <p>
      <p>President Trump says the U.S. strikes in Nigeria on Christmas Day were aimed at ISIS fighters and part of a campaign to stop a supposed anti-Christian “genocide” in the country. But residents of the area say there is no recorded history of anti-Christian terrorism, and organizations monitoring violence in the region say there is no evidence to suggest that Christians are killed more than Muslims and other religious groups in Nigeria. This comes as a suicide bomber detonated an explosive inside a mosque in Nigeria’s Borno state on Christmas Day, killing five worshipers and injuring 35 more.</p>
<p>“Nigeria has a very serious problem of insecurity that affects a wide range of Nigerians, especially those who live in the more remote parts of the country,” but violence impacts “Muslims more so than Christians,” says Yinka Adegoke, Africa editor of <em>Semafor</em>. Adegoke says Trump’s religious framing has more to do with U.S. culture wars and appeasing his base of evangelicals than seriously reckoning with issues of poverty and violence in Nigeria, which he notes were exacerbated by U.S. cuts to foreign aid.</p>

(date: 2025-12-26)
      <p>
      <p>The legendary journalist Bill Moyers died in June at the age of 91. Moyers, whose long career included helping found the Peace Corps and serving as press secretary for President Lyndon Johnson, was an award-winning champion of public television and independent media. We feature one of his numerous interviews on <em>Democracy Now!</em>, where we discussed the history of public broadcasting in the United States and the powerful role of money in corporate media. “The power of money trumps the power of democracy today, and I’m very worried about it,” he said in a 2011 interview.</p>

      <h1>A Tribute to Blacklisted Lyricist Yip Harburg: The Man Who Put the Rainbow in The Wizard of Oz</h1>

(date: 2025-12-25)
      <p>
      <p>His name might not be familiar to many, but his songs are sung by millions around the world. Today, we take a journey through the life and work of Yip Harburg, the Broadway lyricist who wrote such hits as “Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?” and who put the music into <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>, the movie that inspired the hit Broadway musical and now Hollywood blockbuster, <em>Wicked</em>. Born into poverty on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, Harburg always included a strong social and political component to his work, fighting racism and poverty. A lifelong socialist, Harburg was blacklisted and hounded throughout much of his life. We speak with Harburg’s son, Ernie Harburg, about the music and politics of his father. Then we take an in-depth look at <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>, and hear a medley of Harburg’s Broadway songs and the politics of the times in which they were created.</p>

      <h1>Free Leqaa Kordia: Palestinian Woman Who Joined Columbia U. Protest Has Been Detained Since March</h1>

(date: 2025-12-24)
      <p>
      <p>Calls are growing to release Palestinian protester Leqaa Kordia, who was arrested at a 2024 Columbia University Gaza solidarity protest. The charges were dismissed, but when she went to her ICE check-in this past March, she was arrested and immediately sent to the Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, Texas, where she has been held ever since. Although Columbia University student protesters like Mohsen Mahdawi and Mahmoud Khalil have been freed from ICE detention, “her case sort of fell between the cracks,” says Laila El-Haddad, Palestinian writer and journalist from Gaza, who just visited Kordia. El-Haddad also criticizes the Trump administration’s effort to “crack down on any dissent and use immigration law, to weaponize immigration law to silence dissent and to criminalize free speech, especially when that speech relates to Palestine.”</p>

(date: 2025-12-24)
      <p>
      <p><em>Democracy Now!</em> speaks with longtime immigrant rights activist Jeanette Vizguerra, who was just released Monday from ICE jail after nearly 10 months in a Colorado detention center. Vizguerra was ambushed by ICE agents during her work break in March. A judge ordered her detention was unconstitutional, and she was released on bond Monday. Vizguerra describes her time in detention and says she is “very emotional” and glad to be reunited with her children, and plans to keep fighting for her rights and for others. “Her detention was intentional to try and silence people across the country, not only immigrant leaders, but also citizens,” says Jennifer Piper, a supporter and program director for American Friends Service Committee Colorado.</p>

(date: 2025-12-24)
      <p>
      <p>As the DOJ releases the largest batch of files yet on the federal investigation into Epstein, we look at some of the most significant revelations with investigative journalist Vicky Ward, who has spent decades reporting on the deceased sexual predator, his powerful associates and the impact of his crimes. Survivors have condemned the Department of Justice for not complying with the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which required all files to be released last Friday. “I mean, that was the first indication of the contemptuous, cavalier attitude that has gone on inside this Justice Department,” says Ward. “It’s heartbreaking, frankly, to see these files being dribbled out.”</p>

      <h1>Takeaways from Donald Trump and the Epstein files</h1>

(date: 2025-12-23)
      <p>
      <p>The newest US document dump on Jeffrey Epstein is sprawling, uneven and heavily redacted - but tucked inside are moments that have sharpened scrutiny on President Donald Trump's long-acknowledged past association with the notorious sex offender.</p>

      <h1>"Out for Blood": Writer Jasper Nathaniel on Surviving Israeli Settler Attack on W. Bank Olive Farmers</h1>

(date: 2025-12-23)
      <p>
      <p>We speak to independent journalist Jasper Nathaniel, who has recently returned from documenting Israeli settler and state violence against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank. Nathaniel describes being ambushed by settlers in October, on the first day of the olive harvest, in an attack that left one middle-aged Palestinian woman with a brain hemorrhage. “It was clear that this was a planned ambush,” says Nathaniel. “They were out for blood.” Earlier this week, the Israeli Cabinet approved 19 more settlements in the occupied West Bank. “What’s happening right now is these really violent settlers are going out into the fields. They’re stealing land from Palestinians,” explains Nathaniel. “[Then the government will] retroactively legalize the land that was stolen, and basically reward the violent settlers by giving them the stamp of state legitimacy.”</p>

      <h1>CBS Censorship: Bari Weiss Pulls "60 Minutes" Exposé on Torture of Migrants U.S. Sent to El Salvador</h1>

(date: 2025-12-23)
      <p>
      <p>The new head of CBS News, Bari Weiss, is facing accusations of censorship after she abruptly canceled a segment from Sunday’s episode of <em>60 Minutes</em> just three hours before broadcast. The segment centered on the stories of Venezuelan immigrants sent to El Salvador’s brutal CECOT prison by the Trump administration. “When so much of our ability to communicate out facts to the world is concentrated in a small number of people, and there’s a squeezing of independent media and the ability to get independent perspectives and voices out more broadly, I think we’re working with an information ecosystem that is highly dangerous,” says Alexa Koenig of the Human Rights Center at University of California, Berkeley. The center’s research on torture and other human rights violations at CECOT was to be featured in the segment.</p>

      <h1>"Terror & Fear": Trump Moves to Denaturalize Citizens, End Birthright Citizenship, Halt Visa Lottery</h1>

(date: 2025-12-19)
      <p>
      <p>The Trump administration is ramping up efforts to strip more naturalized immigrants of their U.S. citizenship, with <em>The New York Times</em> reporting that officials are seeking 100 to 200 cases per month. The news comes less than two weeks after the Supreme Court agreed to hear a case to decide the constitutionality of President Trump’s executive order aiming to end birthright citizenship.</p>
<p>“During the first Trump administration, they had 25 [denaturalization] cases per year, and … for the 15 years before the first Trump administration, they had fewer than 15 cases per year,” says Mae Ngai, professor of Asian American studies and history at Columbia University. “So this is an incredible escalation.”</p>

      <h1>Kilmar Ábrego García Reunites with Family, But Trump Admin Threatens to Jail & Deport Him Again</h1>

(date: 2025-12-19)
      <p>
      <p>We get an update on the extraordinary case of Kilmar Ábrego García, the Maryland father who first made headlines in March when he was wrongfully deported to El Salvador and held in the notorious CECOT mega-prison. Ábrego García was returned to the United States after months of public outrage, but his ordeal continued as the Trump administration has threatened to deport him to Uganda, Eswatini and Liberia, despite having no ties to those African countries. Last week, a federal judge ordered him released from an ICE jail in Pennsylvania and blocked further arrests as a denial of due process.</p>
<p>Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, one of Ábrego García’s attorneys, says the administration’s actions are primarily meant “to punish him” for standing up for his rights. “It’s also about the government using him, more or less at random, to stand for the principle that they get to do whatever they want, whenever they want, to whomever they want — and, specifically, courts can’t stop them.”</p>

      <h1>Doctors in Jail? Hospitals Stripped of Fed Funding? The Criminalization of Trans Youth Healthcare</h1>

(date: 2025-12-19)
      <p>
      <p>The Trump administration on Thursday announced new measures to target hospitals and doctors providing care to trans youth. Under the new rules unveiled by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Dr. Mehmet Oz, who leads Medicaid and Medicare, the government would strip federal funding for any hospitals that provide pediatric gender-affirming care. The new rules were announced a day after the House of Representatives narrowly approved a bill that aims to criminalize providing gender-affirming medical care for any transgender person under 18 and subject providers to hefty fines and prison time.</p>
<p>“This is a drastic departure from any concern about science, concern about parents and their rights,” says Chase Strangio, co-director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s LGBTQ &amp; HIV Project. “It is putting hospitals in an impossible situation, and just another example of this administration undermining and threatening all of our health and welfare.”</p>
<p>We also speak with Dr. Jeffrey Birnbaum, a pediatrician and adolescent medicine specialist who works with transgender youth in New York City. He says the families he works with are “terrified right now,” but vows to continue his work. “I refuse to stop providing this care, knowing that I could potentially face 10 years in prison and a felony charge. I’m willing to go down that route, if necessary.”</p>
