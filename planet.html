      <p>With a Motu Proprio, Pope Leo XIV has abrogated Article 8 n. 1 of the previous Fundamental Law of Vatican City State, which had allowed only cardinals to serve as president of the Commission, a position currently held by Sister Raffaella Petrini. The Pope, therefore, consolidates a change wanted by Francis and resolves an issue that had emerged due to increasingly “complex and pressing” governance needs.</p>

(date: 2025-11-20)
      <p>
      <p>Talks at the COP30 climate summit in Belém, Brazil, were suspended on Thursday after a fire broke out in the venue, triggering evacuations that halted negotiations between more than 190 delegations. The summit was set to conclude Friday, and the disruption came at a critical moment as countries were locked in tense debates over fossil fuels and climate finance. The outcome of these talks is widely seen as a litmus test for turning decades of climate pledges into concrete action.</p>

<p>When it comes to the Epstein files, there are solid reasons to withold certain information from the public, experts say.

<p>The March 23, 1994, death of Luis Donaldo Colosio, a reformer on the cusp of winning the Mexican presidency who promised a more just and democratic country, holds a space in the country's consciousness like the 1963 killing of President John F. Kennedy does in the United States. Federal authorities in Mexico recently arrested a 64-year-old man in Tijuana in connection with Colosio’s killing.</p>

(date: 2025-11-08)
      <p>
      <p>There is a common thread running through the magisterium of the new Pope: he has proposed a model of Christian community, missionary in nature, where communion is lived, and which is therefore capable of serving all, starting with the least; a community committed to fostering dialogue and peace. A Church that does not “lean” on the powerful nor confuse mission with religious marketing, but knows how to be leaven because it reflects the light of Another.</p>
