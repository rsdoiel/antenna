      <h1>World Food Day LIVE: The task of feeding the world</h1>

(date: 2025-10-16)
      <p>
      <p>Amid the destruction of the Second World War, nations responded to the danger of hunger and malnutrition by creating the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) on 16 October 1945. The UN agency celebrates this achievement as World Food Day every year on its birthday, recognizing the work of all those who are committed to ensuring food for everyone. We’ll be bringing you the highlights live from FAO throughout the day. UN News app users can follow coverage here.</p>

<p>The killing has stopped. Surviving Israeli hostages have been released to their families, while hundreds of Palestinians held by Israel have been returned to theirs. But to call an end to the Gaza war, as Trump did, the “historic dawn of a new Middle East” wildly overstates what the deal delivers.</p>
