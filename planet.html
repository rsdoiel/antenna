U.S. President Donald Trump will start his Middle East trip Tuesday by

famine created by Israel’s blockade of two million people — seems
certain to haunt the president’s trip.

<p>date: 2025-05-04, from: Vatican News</p>
<pre><code>                &lt;p&gt;During the eighth Mass of the Novemdiales in memory of Pope Francis, the Cardinal and former Pro-Prefect of the Dicastery for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life invites the faithful to turn the apostles&#39; enthusiasm, sparked by the appearance of the Risen Christ, into a &quot;life program.&quot; Their &quot;wonder,&quot; in contrast to &quot;bewilderment&quot; and &quot;discouragement,&quot; becomes a model for those today who are in &quot;great need of encountering the Lord.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

With more than 100 friendship centres across Canada, these community
hubs have long served as safe and welcoming spaces for multigenerational
urban Indigenous people — supporting their rights, well-being and
cultural preservation. Today, this vital movement continues to grow and
thrive.
