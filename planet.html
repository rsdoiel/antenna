      <p>With a Motu Proprio, Pope Leo XIV has abrogated Article 8 n. 1 of the previous Fundamental Law of Vatican City State, which had allowed only cardinals to serve as president of the Commission, a position currently held by Sister Raffaella Petrini. The Pope, therefore, consolidates a change wanted by Francis and resolves an issue that had emerged due to increasingly “complex and pressing” governance needs.</p>

(date: 2025-11-20)
      <p>
      <p>Talks at the COP30 climate summit in Belém, Brazil, were suspended on Thursday after a fire broke out in the venue, triggering evacuations that halted negotiations between more than 190 delegations. The summit was set to conclude Friday, and the disruption came at a critical moment as countries were locked in tense debates over fossil fuels and climate finance. The outcome of these talks is widely seen as a litmus test for turning decades of climate pledges into concrete action.</p>

<p>When it comes to the Epstein files, there are solid reasons to withold certain information from the public, experts say. However, there are also grey areas that could cause disputes between lawmakers and the U.S. Department of Justice, and which could frustrate those seeking as much information as possible about the case.</p>

Statistics suggest there are some 40,000 children in Gaza who’ve lost one or more parents, resulting in what one Palestinian organization has called “the largest orphan crisis in modern history.”</p>

<p>Mu’ayyad Ajjour and his neighbour Mohamed Zaida have searched every day among the ruins of a building, hoping to find the remains of five-year-old Masa, Ajjour's cousin, so they can give her a proper burial. Her body is one of thousands thought to be buried in the debris of the war in Gaza. On Saturday, her remains were located and her body was taken to be buried.</p>
