Day 1 Convective Outlook CORR 1
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1035 AM CST Mon Nov 11 2024

Valid 111630Z - 121200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

CORRECTED FOR NDFD GRAPHIC

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms appear unlikely through tonight.

...Discussion...
A progressive large-scale regime will persist with troughing
prevalent over the West and Great Lakes to Northeast, with upper
ridging over the Great Plains. Over the middle Gulf Coast, isolated
to widely scattered, episodic thunderstorms will be possible near an
inverted trough and convergence zone in low levels, extending
northeastward from the weakening, post-tropical remains of Rafael. A
few strong storms may occur near coastal southeast Louisiana, but
near-land severe potential should remain limited.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0940 AM CST Mon Nov 11 2024

Valid 111700Z - 121200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The forecast remains on track, and please see the previous
discussion for more details.

..Nauslar.. 11/11/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1222 AM CST Mon Nov 11 2024/

...Synopsis...
A trough will move inland from the Pacific across the western US
today. This will bring enhanced westerly flow aloft across the
southern Sierra and into the Great Basin. While there is some
potential for rain/snow showers, an increase in southwesterly
surface winds will overlap dry conditions across portions of
southern Nevada and along/east of the southern Sierra. Though
relative-humidity reductions to around 15-20 percent are likely with
sustained winds 10-15 mph (gusting higher), fuels in these regions
are largely unreceptive to fire spread. This will preclude the need
to include probabilities at this time.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0644 AM CST Mon Nov 11 2024

Valid 111300Z - 121200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms appear unlikely through tonight.

...Synopsis/Discussion...
In mid/upper levels, troughing will cross the Great Lakes and West
Coast regions this period, with a substantial synoptic-scale ridge
in between, across the Great Plains.  The western trough will cross
most of the Pacific Coast between 18-00Z today, then progress to
near a line from GEG-BOI-ELY-PHX to Hermosillo, MX.  In the lengthy
zone of strong large-scale ascent/cooling aloft that precedes the
trough, isolated thunderstorms already have been noted offshore, and
over the southwestern OR Coast.  This potential will spread inland
today until the trough moves past at least marginally favorable
low/middle-level moisture to support deep convection. 

Elsewhere, thunder potential will be minimal, except for part of the
central Gulf Coast from near the mouth of the Mississippi River to
around PNS.  Isolated to widely scattered, episodic thunderstorms
will be possible near an inverted trough and convergence zone in low
levels, extending northeastward from the weakening, post-tropical
remains of Rafael.  Though most of the convection will remain over
the Gulf, isolated thunderstorms are possible in the outlook area.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1122 AM CST Sun Nov 10 2024

Valid 111200Z - 121200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms will be possible on Monday along parts of the eastern
Gulf Coast, Atlantic Seaboard and in the western states. No severe
threat is expected across the continental U.S. Monday or Monday
night.

...DISCUSSION...
A mid-level trough will move through the eastern U.S. on Monday, as
a cold front advances southeastward into the Mid-Atlantic and
southern Appalachians. Ahead of the front, thunderstorms will be
possible on Monday within a moist airmass across the eastern
Carolinas. Isolated storms may also occur along a sea breeze
boundary in coastal parts of south and east Florida. In addition,
some lighting strikes may occur in the central Gulf Coast, in
association with the outer bands of Tropical Cyclone Rafael. In the
western U.S., thunderstorms may develop on Monday ahead of a
mid-level trough from the Sierras northward into western Oregon and
western Washington. No severe threat is expected across the
continental U.S. Monday and Monday night.
