Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0751 AM CDT Wed Jul 17 2024

Valid 171300Z - 181200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PARTS OF THE
MID-ATLANTIC INTO CENTRAL/SOUTHERN NEW ENGLAND...

...SUMMARY...
Damaging thunderstorm gusts appear most likely and concentrated
today over parts of the Mid-Atlantic into central/southern New
England.

...Synopsis...
In mid/upper levels, a seasonally high-amplitude pattern will
dominate the CONUS through the period, with longwave ridging in the
West and troughing in the East.  Anchoring the ridge, a persistent
anticyclone -- previously over the Four Corners area including NM --
will reorganize and retrograde slightly westward, becoming centered
over the Monument Valley region of AZ/UT by the end of the period. 
Meanwhile, a synoptic-scale trough -- apparent in moisture-channel
imagery from James Bay to southern MN and northern IA -- will pivot
across the Upper Great Lakes and adjoining states through this
evening.  By 12Z, this trough should extend from central QC to the
Lower Great Lakes and upper Ohio Valley region.

A large area of cyclonic flow -- generally weakening with outward
extent from jet cores over the Great Lakes States and Northeast --
should cover much of the CONUS east of the Rockies and north of the
Gulf Coast States.  On its southwestern periphery, strong difluence
will persist over the central/southern High Plains and much of TX. 
Within and beneath that, a prominent MCV was apparent in radar-
reflectivity composites northwest of OKC.  This feature is forecast
to drift southeastward over central/southeastern OK today, then
pivot eastward into southern AR overnight.

At the surface, 11Z analysis showed a cold front from southern QC
across LAKE Ontario, northwestern OH, central IN, southern IL,
south-central MO, southeastern KS, northwestern OK, the TX
Panhandle, and central/southeastern NM.  The cold front is, and will
continue to be, diffused along segments of its extent by
baroclinicity from outflows of varying sizes.  Still, in general, it
should reach western New England, the Delaware Valley, western VA,
middle TN, southern AR, to a weak frontal-wave low over north-
central/northeast TX by 00Z.  By 12Z, the front should extend from
near Cape Cod to central/eastern VA, north-central MS, and southern
AR, with a low lingering over northeast TX near or even somewhat
behind the MCV.

...Mid-Atlantic to New England...
Scattered to widely scattered thunderstorms are expected to develop
initially during midday near the cold front, then through the
afternoon ahead of the cold front (especially over higher terrain
and near prefrontal troughing in the boundary layer).  Convective
coverage and intensity should increase as this activity moves
eastward to northeastward across the outlook area, forming a blend
of discrete storms, clusters and lines.  Damaging gusts will be the
primary hazard, and several gusts above severe limits are possible
as well.

As the mid/upper-level synoptic trough approaches, deep-layer
southwest flow and shear will strengthen over the area, with the
mean-wind and deep-shear vectors oriented along to slightly
rightward of the axes of convective forcing.  This will support the
mixed modes, which may include isolate supercell structures as well.
Overall organization will be aided by 30-40-kt effective-shear
magnitudes from central PA northeastward, and 20-30 kt farther south
and southwest.  Meanwhile, the greatest buoyancy should reside over
the coastal Mid-Atlantic amid rich moisture and strong diurnal
heating.  Although midlevel lapse rates are forecast to be very weak
(near or even less than moist-adiabatic in some layers), ambient
low-level theta-e and diabatic heating should drive MLCAPE into the
1000-1500 J/kg range over most of the region, and around 2000 J/kg
near the coast -- all atop well-mixed subcloud layers supporting
downdraft accelerations.

...Central/southern High Plains...
Widely scattered to scattered thunderstorms -- some quickly evolving
to outflow-driven, forward-propagating clusters -- should form this
afternoon over the Sangre de Cristos, Front Range, Laramie Range,
and attendant foothills/ridges.  Damaging to isolated severe gusts
will be the primary concern, though isolated severe hail also is
possible.

Activity should form first over the mountains, where heating of high
terrain and at least marginal moisture will combine to
preferentially erode MLCINH.  Lee troughing should develop over the
High Plains late tonight, but before then, a substantial, post-
frontal upslope/easterly flow component generally will prevail in
low levels.  This will aid in lift and storm-relative boundary-layer
winds available to convection moving generally southeastward out of
the higher terrain.  An axis of low-level moisture will correspond
well to a buoyancy axis as well, with peak MLCAPE around 1000-1500
J/kg in a corridor roughly from the NE Panhandle to western KS by
21Z, then gradually diminishing as nocturnal cooling occurs and
outflow impinges on parts of the area from the west.  Modest
midlevel winds and weak shear should exist over most of this area,
despite strong directional change with height in low/middle levels. 
Steep low/middle-level lapse rates -- near dry adiabatic in the
boundary layer -- will support strong-severe gust potential in the
most vigorous cells/clusters.

...North TX to central AR...
Widely scattered to scattered showers and thunderstorms should
develop over a vast area along and southeast of the front this
afternoon, southwestward from the outlook in the Atlantic Seaboard
across the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys, Southeast CONUS, and Mid-South to
north/central TX.  Most of this activity will be in a weak-shear but
moisture-rich setting.

While isolated, pulse-severe downbursts cannot be ruled out with the
most intense activity anywhere in those regions, the greatest
potential concentration of both convection and at least marginal
severe potential appears to be over parts of north-central/northeast
TX into central AR, along and either side of the I-30 corridor.  A
combination of lift along the front and prefrontal outflows, with
enhanced convergence in the MCV's mass response, and strong warm
sector diurnal heating, will strip away MLCINH this afternoon and
favor relatively dense development.  Additional activity should form
along both colliding outflow/differential-heating boundaries and the
leading-edge/forced-ascent zone of any clusters' cold pools that can
surge into the high-theta-e preconvective boundary layer.  Upper 60s
to low 70s F surface dewpoints will support MLCAPE in the 2000-3000
J/kg range (locally higher), with well-mixed subcloud layers despite
the rich moisture.  Weak vertical shear will limit the overall
organization of the threat.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0208 AM CDT Wed Jul 17 2024

Valid 181200Z - 191200Z

...Synopsis...
Dry thunderstorms over parts of the Great Basin will be the primary
fire weather threat for Thursday, though localized wind-driven fire
weather concerns in the lee of the Cascades are possible. 

...Great Basin...
A weak upper-level impulse is currently approaching the Pacific
Northwest per early-morning satellite imagery. This feature is
forecast to crest an upper ridge along the northern Rockies through
the day Thursday, leaving a trailing plume of monsoonal moisture in
its wake across the eastern Great Basin. Forcing for ascent
associated with the shortwave trough will become increasingly
displaced from the region through the day; however, orographic
ascent will likely support isolated thunderstorm development by late
afternoon across eastern NV into ID and UT. PWAT values in the 0.4
to 0.7 inch range and nearly 3 km deep boundary layers suggest that
thunderstorms should mostly be dry. Increasing PWAT values with
eastward and southward extent should yield higher probabilities for
wetting rainfall across the Four Corners and central Rockies. Areas
that do not receive rainfall over the next 24 hours (which should be
spatially limited) should have receptive fuels support lightning
starts. 

...Cascades...
Low to mid-level winds are forecast to become more
west/southwesterly in the wake of the upper disturbance. As this
occurs, downslope and gap winds are forecast to strengthen with most
solutions indicating that 15-20 mph winds (gusting to 25-30 mph)
will be possible for wind-prone locations in the immediate lee of
the Cascades. With little rainfall expected from dry thunderstorms
over the next 24 hours and antecedent dry fuels already in place,
localized elevated fire weather conditions are anticipated. Based on
latest high-res deterministic and ensemble guidance, this potential
appears to be fairly spatially limited to the Columbia Gorge and far
south-central OR in the lee of the Fremont Mountains, precluding a
broader risk area at this time.

Mesoscale Discussion 1657
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0349 PM CDT Tue Jul 16 2024

Areas affected...Southeast CO...northeast NM...southwest KS...TX/OK
Panhandles

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 162049Z - 162245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Some increase in the severe-wind and isolated hail threat
is possible through late afternoon into early evening.

DISCUSSION...Convection developing near the higher terrain of
south-central CO into northeast NM has gradually intensified this
afternoon, with a recent measured gust of 51 kt at Colorado Springs.
Farther east, storms are beginning to develop across parts of
southeast CO into the Raton Mesa vicinity. Low-level moisture is
generally rather modest across the region, but strong heating has
resulted in MLCAPE increasing to 500-1000 J/kg, with some further
increase possible into late afternoon. Modest northwesterly midlevel
flow along the periphery of an upper ridge over the southern Rockies
is supporting effective shear of 25-35 kt, which may support
occasional storm organization.

Initial discrete storms will continue to pose a threat of isolated
severe gusts and possibly some hail. With time, increasingly
prominent outflow within the initially hot and well-mixed
environment will support development of one or more loosely
organized clusters, which would move southeastward with some
increase in the severe-wind threat into parts of the
central/southern High Plains. Watch issuance is possible over parts
of the region, if a more organized severe threat appears imminent.

Mesoscale Discussion 1656
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0300 PM CDT Tue Jul 16 2024

Areas affected...Central and Eastern New York into Vermont

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 546...547...

Valid 162000Z - 162130Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 546, 547
continues.

SUMMARY...The severe weather threat continues for WW 547, with
measured wind gusts of 65+ MPH and a few tornadoes possible.

DISCUSSION...The severe weather threat continues for Central and
Eastern New York this afternoon, as an ongoing linear convective
complex moves across the highlight area. Measured wind gusts of 65+
MPH have already been observed, in addition to tornadoes. This
convective activity is expected to persist over the next few hours
as it moves eastward into Vermont.

There is a localized corridor of enhanced tornado potential in the
center of the convective line, where low-level convective
organization and rotation is concentrated in a favorable environment
of STP > 1. Multiple embedded circulations have been observed
already, and will likely persist in the storm term.

Mesoscale Discussion 1655
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0240 PM CDT Tue Jul 16 2024

Areas affected...Central NE into parts of north-central KS and
south-central SD

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 161940Z - 162145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Strong to severe storms may develop by late afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Cumulus is deepening this afternoon across parts of
south-central NE, with some building cumulus also noted into
northwest NE and extreme south-central SD. The building cumulus is
ongoing within a region of relatively rich low-level moisture, with
diurnal heating supporting MLCAPE of near/above 1500 J/kg and
weakening MLCINH. In the absence of stronger large-scale ascent,
details regarding storm coverage and timing of more robust storm
development remain uncertain. However, storm initiation is underway
across south-central NE, with at least isolated development possible
farther north, within a zone of modest low-level confluence near a
weak surface low across central NE. 

Low-level flow is weak, but modest midlevel west-northwesterlies are
supporting effective shear of 30-40 kt, and it is possible that a
couple of supercells and/or stronger storm clusters could develop by
late afternoon into the early evening. Midlevel lapse rates are
generally rather weak, but some hail threat could accompany any
sustained supercells, along with a threat of localized severe gusts.
Watch issuance is possible for parts of the area later this
afternoon, if development of multiple severe storms appears
imminent.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0257 PM CDT Tue Jul 16 2024

Valid 162000Z - 171200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS PORTIONS OF
EASTERN NEW YORK INTO SOUTHERN VERMONT...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS
CENTRAL/EASTERN NEBRASKA...SOUTHEAST COLORADO INTO NORTHWEST
OKLAHOMA...SOUTHERN MISSOURI INTO WESTERN KENTUCKY...

...SUMMARY...
Strong to severe thunderstorms are possible from the central Plains
to the Northeast.  Greatest severe-thunderstorm threats within that
are over parts of the central Plains and upper Ohio Valley to parts
of the northern Mid-Atlantic and western New England.

...20Z Update...
Severe probabilities have been adjusted behind ongoing convection
and the mid-level shortwave in parts of New York and Pennsylvania.
Elsewhere, the outlook remains mostly on track with only minor
adjustments based on current observations and expected convective
evolution.

..Wendt.. 07/16/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1128 AM CDT Tue Jul 16 2024/

...Northeast States...
A well-defined shortwave trough and embedded MCV from last night's
severe MCS is tracking into western NY.  Strong heating of a moist
air mass ahead of this system will result in intensification of
thunderstorms early this afternoon, with storms tracking eastward
across NY/northern PA into New England this evening.  Damaging winds
(potentially widespread) will be the main concern with these storms,
although hail and a tornado or two are also possible.  Have expanded
the SLGT risk to the MA/NH coast, given favorable westerly surface
winds and morning CAM solutions suggesting that MCS may persist that
far.

South of the main upper feature, a hot and humid air mass is present
from central PA and NJ southward.  Widely scattered afternoon
thunderstorms will develop in this area, despite rather weak
forcing.  Sufficient winds aloft will promote a few organized storm
clusters, capable of damaging wind gusts.

...CO/KS/OK/TX...
Full sunshine will lead to very deep boundary-layer mixing and
scattered high-based showers/thunderstorms along the Colorado Front
Range this afternoon.  This activity will be capable of locally
gusty/damaging winds.  As the convection spread east-southeastward
into a progressively more moist air mass, intensification and
organization of storms into an MCS is expected.  This system will
track into southwest KS and northwest OK this evening, with a
continued risk of locally damaging wind gusts.

...Central NE...
A surface cold front is sagging southward across SD/NE today. 
Thunderstorms are expected to intensify along this front over
central NE late this afternoon or early evening.  Activity will
track southward for a few hours, posing a risk of damaging wind
gusts.

...Mid MS Valley...
A large and persistent area of thunderstorms has been affecting
portions of MO/IL all morning, resulting in a very large cloud
shield.  This will significantly impact heating/destabilization
later today.  Therefore, have adjusted the SLGT region to the areas
along and south of the cloud shield, where strong heating is still
possible.  12z CAM solutions suggest storms will build southward
from this MCS across southern MO/western KY and into parts of AR/TN
later today, with some risk of damaging winds.

1220 PM CDT Tue Jul 16 2024

Valid 171200Z - 181200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR THE NORTHERN
MID-ATLANTIC INTO PARTS OF SOUTHERN NEW ENGLAND...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated strong to severe thunderstorms are possible from the
Carolinas into New England on Wednesday, with a corridor of greater
coverage from northeast Virginia into the Hudson Valley and adjacent
southern Vermont/western Massachusetts. Isolated strong to severe
thunderstorms are possible across the central High Plains as well.

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough is expected to shift eastward, with some
southward digging into the northern Mid-Atlantic states on
Wednesday. In the West, an upper-level ridge is expected to amplify
somewhat roughly over the Divide. A shortwave trough will slide
northward through the Northwest during the period along the western
flank of the upper ridge. At the surface, a cold front will be
situated from the southern Plains into the Ohio Valley. A surface
trough will deepen near the Blue Ridge during the afternoon.

...Mid-Atlantic into the Northeast...
Scattered to numerous thunderstorms are expected to develop
along/ahead of the cold front and surface trough during the
afternoon. While mid-level lapse rates will be rather weak, strong
heating will support 2000-3000 J/kg of MLCAPE, particularly east of
the Blue Ridge. Enhanced mid-level winds with the approaching trough
should support at least modest storm organization. Shear will be
slightly greater within the northern Mid-Atlantic into parts of
southern New England. Buoyancy will decrease with northward extent,
however. The expectation is for a few clusters/linear segments, and
perhaps a marginal supercell or two, to pose a risk of primarily
damaging winds. Warm temperatures aloft should keep large hail
potential low.

...High Plains...
Upslope flow behind the cold front will push low-level moisture up
against the terrain. Dewpoints in the mid/upper 40s F are generally
expected by the afternoon, though some low 50s F are possible
especially farther to the east. Modest northwesterly flow aloft on
the western flank of the upper trough will support from 25 kts of
effective shear near the Raton to around 35 kts in eastern Wyoming
and the Nebraska Panhandle. Given the modest shear and relatively
dry boundary layer, storms are expected to be outflow dominant with
an attendant risk for severe winds. Some large hail threat could
occur within the first hour or two of storm initiation.

...ArkLaTex Vicinity...
An MCV from convection within parts of the Front Range on Tuesday
evening is expected to be over Oklahoma at the beginning of the
period. Heating ahead of this feature appears likely to support
scattered storms from parts of North Texas into the ArkLaTex. While
strong wind gusts are possible, the disorganized wind profile is not
expected to support and organized severe threat.

..Thornton.. 07/16/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0133 AM CDT Tue Jul 16 2024/

...Synopsis...
Another afternoon of dry thunderstorms is expected later today
across parts of the Great Basin and Pacific Northwest. Regional 00
UTC soundings continue to show a gradual moistening trend across
much of the West that has been noted over the past 48 hours. This
comes amid several days of widely scattered thunderstorms and a
steady influx of mid-level monsoonal moisture evident in advected
PWAT satellite imagery. Consequently, thermodynamic conditions
appear to favor a mixture of wet and dry thunderstorms across the
eastern Great Basin, Southwest, and central Rockies this afternoon.
To the west on the periphery of the better moisture (where PWATs are
generally around 0.75 inch), dry thunderstorms will be more probable
as lift associated with a weak upper low overspreads the West
Coast/western Great Basin. Recent analyses continue to suggest that
fuels are receptive to lightning starts, and gusty outflow winds may
impact ongoing fires across the region.

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON
AND EVENING ACROSS PORTIONS OF NEW YORK AND VERMONT...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ELSEWHERE OVER
MUCH OF THE NORTHEAST...AS WELL AS PARTS OF:  CENTRAL
PLAINS...SOUTH-CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS...OZARKS...AND LOWER
MISSOURI/OHIO VALLEY REGIONS...

...SUMMARY...
Strong to severe thunderstorms are possible from the central Plains
to the Northeast.  Greatest severe-thunderstorm threats within that
are over parts of the central Plains and upper Ohio Valley to parts
of the northern Mid-Atlantic and western New England.

...Northeast States...
A well-defined shortwave trough and embedded MCV from last night's
severe MCS is tracking into western NY.  Strong heating of a moist
air mass ahead of this system will result in intensification of
thunderstorms early this afternoon, with storms tracking eastward
across NY/northern PA into New England this evening.  Damaging winds
(potentially widespread) will be the main concern with these storms,
although hail and a tornado or two are also possible.  Have expanded
the SLGT risk to the MA/NH coast, given favorable westerly surface
winds and morning CAM solutions suggesting that MCS may persist that
far.

South of the main upper feature, a hot and humid air mass is present
from central PA and NJ southward.  Widely scattered afternoon
thunderstorms will develop in this area, despite rather weak
forcing.  Sufficient winds aloft will promote a few organized storm
clusters, capable of damaging wind gusts.

...CO/KS/OK/TX...
Full sunshine will lead to very deep boundary-layer mixing and
scattered high-based showers/thunderstorms along the Colorado Front
Range this afternoon.  This activity will be capable of locally
gusty/damaging winds.  As the convection spread east-southeastward
into a progressively more moist air mass, intensification and
organization of storms into an MCS is expected.  This system will
track into southwest KS and northwest OK this evening, with a
continued risk of locally damaging wind gusts.

...Central NE...
A surface cold front is sagging southward across SD/NE today. 
Thunderstorms are expected to intensify along this front over
central NE late this afternoon or early evening.  Activity will
track southward for a few hours, posing a risk of damaging wind
gusts.

...Mid MS Valley...
A large and persistent area of thunderstorms has been affecting
portions of MO/IL all morning, resulting in a very large cloud
shield.  This will significantly impact heating/destabilization
later today.  Therefore, have adjusted the SLGT region to the areas
along and south of the cloud shield, where strong heating is still
possible.  12z CAM solutions suggest storms will build southward
from this MCS across southern MO/western KY and into parts of AR/TN
later today, with some risk of damaging winds.

Mesoscale Discussion 1650
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0933 AM CDT Tue Jul 16 2024

Areas affected...Western/central NY into northern PA

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 161433Z - 161630Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...The severe-thunderstorm threat will increase through the
morning, with a threat of damaging winds, isolated hail, and
possibly a tornado. Watch issuance is likely.

DISCUSSION...A well-defined MCV is moving across parts of southern
Ontario this morning, with storms already increasing in coverage and
intensity in the vicinity of Lake Ontario. Diurnal
heating/destabilization downstream of the MCV will support more
widespread thunderstorm development across western NY and perhaps
northern PA later this morning. Rather substantial enhancement to
low/midlevel flow related to the MCV (which is already noted on KPBZ
and KBUF VWPs) will support organized convection, in the presence of
MLCAPE increasing into the 1000-2000 J/kg range. 

While eventual clustering and potential MCS development is expected,
a couple of supercells will also be possible, both with initial
development, and also embedded in any upscale growth that occurs
later in convective evolution. Scattered damaging wind and localized
gusts of 60-70 mph will be possible by late morning into the
afternoon, along with some potential for isolated hail and a tornado
or two with any persistent supercells. Watch issuance is likely by
late morning in order to address these threats.

Mesoscale Discussion 1649
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0845 AM CDT Tue Jul 16 2024

Areas affected...Extreme northeast KS into parts of MO and southwest
IL

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 545...

Valid 161345Z - 161515Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 545
continues.

SUMMARY...Some threat for damaging/severe gusts may continue through
the morning. Additional watch issuance is possible.

DISCUSSION...One thunderstorm cluster with a history of producing
severe gusts is currently near Kansas City, with another potentially
severe storm cluster over north-central MO. Other less-organized
convection is ongoing from southeast MO into southwest IL. Evolution
of the ongoing convection through the morning remains uncertain,
with a pocket of diurnal heating potential in advance of the
north-central MO cluster, and some heating/destabilization also
expected south of the storms across southeast MO/southwest IL. 

MUCAPE in excess of 1500 J/kg and marginally supportive deep-layer
shear could continue to support some organized severe-wind potential
through the morning, especially in advance of the north-central MO
cluster. Downstream watch issuance into parts of eastern MO is
possible, depending on short-term convective trends. Some severe
threat could also eventually evolve out of the southeast
MO/southwest IL convection.

Mesoscale Discussion 1615
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0315 PM CDT Sun Jul 14 2024

Areas affected...Parts of IA...northern IL...southern WI

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 142015Z - 142145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Strong to severe storm development is expected later this
afternoon into the evening. Eventual watch issuance is likely.

DISCUSSION...Rather strong heating/destabilization is underway
across much of IA this afternoon, while recovery in the wake of
morning convection/outflow is ongoing across northern IL. Meanwhile,
the remnant MCV from last night's severe MCS over the Dakotas is
currently moving across northern IA. As MLCINH continues to erode
across northern/eastern IA and MLCAPE increases above 3000 J/kg, the
MCV may aid in scattered thunderstorm development later this
afternoon. Midlevel flow is not particularly strong across the
region, but sufficient to support effective shear of 25-35 kt and
potential for some storm organization. 

Initial discrete development could evolve into a supercell or two,
with a threat of hail, locally damaging wind, and possibly a
tornado. In conjunction with the MCV, a persistent 20-30 kt
southwesterly low-level jet could encourage relatively quick
clustering and upscale growth, with some potential for an MCS to
develop and move eastward across northern IL and southern WI this
evening, with a continued severe-wind threat.  

Farther northwest, in the wake of the MCV, cumulus is deepening
along a weak surface boundary across northwest IA. While this area
is in the immediate wake of the MCV, strong buoyancy and sufficient
deep-layer shear would support severe-thunderstorm potential in this
area as well, if storms can mature. 

While favored timing and area remain somewhat uncertain, watch
issuance will become increasingly likely if storm initiation appears
imminent across the region.

Mesoscale Discussion 1614
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0206 PM CDT Sun Jul 14 2024

Areas affected...Southern IN into western OH

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 532...

Valid 141906Z - 142030Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 532
continues.

SUMMARY...A threat for at least isolated damaging wind is expected
to continue through late afternoon.

DISCUSSION...A loosely organized MCS continues to move
east-southeastward across parts of southern IN into western OH this
afternoon. Recent measured gusts have generally been in the 30-45 kt
range, though some wind damage was reported earlier across northern
IN. Generally weak low/midlevel flow may continue to limit
organization potential through the afternoon. However, the
downstream thermodynamic environment remains favorable for
damaging-wind potential, with MLCAPE in excess of 1500 J/kg and
steepening low-level lapse rates, and some threat for at least
isolated damaging wind is expected to continue through late
afternoon.
