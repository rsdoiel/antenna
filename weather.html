Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0722 AM CDT Tue Oct 29 2024

Valid 291300Z - 301200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorm development may occur late tonight from the Upper
Mississippi Valley south-southwestward across the central and
southern Plains, with some potential for storms to produce severe
hail and/or wind.

...Central/Southern Plains...
A prominent mid/upper-level trough centered over the Great Basin and
Southwest Deserts will continue generally eastward toward the
central/southern Rockies through late tonight. Preceding this upper
trough will be a nocturnally maximized strong southwesterly
low-level jet, with a strengthening lee trough and increasing
warm-sector low-level moisture in advance of a cold front (and
southern Plains surface trough/dryline), that will generally extend
by late tonight from the Upper Midwest southwestward across
Nebraska/Kansas into the southern High Plains.

Given limited initial height falls and modest-quality autumnal
low-level moisture, it is likely that a mid-level cap generally
based around 800 mb will persist regionally through the peak heating
cycle, with increasing prospects for deepening convection focused in
the overnight and early morning hours of Wednesday. This could start
across central Nebraska/northern Kansas near the cold front as early
as late evening or early in the overnight, with a subsequent
southward expansion across Kansas into western Oklahoma and possibly
the far eastern Texas Panhandle through the predawn hours, where a
conditional potential for near-surface-based storms may exist
coincident with roughly 60-63F surface dewpoints. Given the strength
of the wind field and increasing moisture/modest buoyancy
regionally, organized thunderstorms are possible with some localized
potential for severe hail and wind late tonight.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook

...DISCUSSION...
...Thursday/Day 4 to Saturday/Day 6...
An upper-level trough is forecast to move eastward into the upper
Mississippi Valley on Thursday, and into the Northeast on Friday. At
the surface, a cold front is forecast to advance southeastward into
the Gulf Coast states. Thunderstorm development will be likely near
and ahead of the front Thursday afternoon and evening. Weak
instability and limited large-scale ascent should keep any severe
threat marginal.

From Friday into Saturday, low-level moisture return is expected to
take place further west into the southern Plains. Thunderstorms are
forecast to develop on Friday over parts of eastern New Mexico and
west Texas, with an isolated severe threat possible. On Saturday,
moisture and instability is forecast to increase across the southern
and central Plains, which could result in an expansion of severe
threat coverage. However, the latest models suggest that instability
will be relatively weak in most areas, helping to marginalize the
severe threat.

...Sunday/Day 7 and Monday/Day 8...
On Sunday and Monday, an upper-level system is forecast to move from
near the southern California coast into northwestern Mexico. Ahead
of the system, an anticyclonic and subtle southwesterly mid-level
flow pattern is forecast in the south-central U.S, where a moist
airmass should be located. Isolated to scattered thunderstorms are
expected to develop on both Sunday and Monday afternoons with this
airmass. The strongest instability is forecast to be near the
western edge of the moist airmass, suggesting the greatest severe
potential could be from west Texas extending north-northeastward
into the central Plains. Forecast instability should be relatively
weak, keeping any severe threat marginal.
