is drifting over the warm waters of the Gulf <br>Stream, and some
tropical or subtropical development could occur <br>over the next day or
two. By the middle of this week, the system is <br>expected to move
northward over cooler waters, ending its chances <br>for further
tropical development. For more information on this <br>system, see High

Hurricane Henriette Discussion Number  31
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   EP082025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 AM HST Mon Aug 11 2025

Henriette now has a compact Central Dense Overcast, with a dimple 
noted in visible satellite imagery where a small eye could be 
attempting to form, surrounded by a long spiral band.  Subjective 
and objective satellite intensity estimates are relatively 
unchanged from 6 hours ago, so the initial intensity is still 
assumed to be around 75 kt.

The initial motion is also unchanged--northwestward, or 310/16 kt.  
The track guidance is tightly packed for the next 48-60 hours, with 
Henriette expected to continue moving northwestward between a 
mid-level low northwest of the Hawaiian Islands and a large ridge 
centered off the coast of the Pacific Northwest United States.  
There is more significant spread after 60 hours, related to whether 
or not Henriette gets picked up by a shortwave trough near the 
Aleutian Islands (and turns eastward, as in the GFS) or gets left 
behind and continues northward (as in the ECWMF).  The new NHC 
track forecast is a little east of the previous prediction at the 
end of the forecast, leaning toward the new consensus aids.
 
Some intensification is still possible during the next 12 hours or 
so while there remains some favorable divergence aloft, and the NHC 
intensity forecast reflects that potential.  By 24 hours, 
upper-level convergence, increasing northerly to northwesterly 
shear, and cooling sea surface temperatures are expected to induce 
weakening.  Henriette could lose its organized deep convection, and 
thus become post-tropical, in about 60 hours, with the remnant low 
likely dissipating by day 5 over the far northern Pacific.

0328 PM CDT Mon Aug 11 2025

Areas affected...central Oklahoma into northeast Oklahoma

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 112028Z - 112200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated damaging wind gusts are possible this
afternoon/evening.

DISCUSSION...A slow moving cold front is advancing southeast across
Oklahoma. Ahead of this front, temperatures in the low to mid 90s
and dewpoints in the upper 60s to low 70s have yielded 2500 J/kg
MLCAPE amid moderately steep mid-level lapse rates (~8 C/km per 12Z
OUN RAOB). A remnant MCV can be seen in visible satellite imagery
approaching central Oklahoma which will also likely be a focus for
stronger storms this afternoon/evening. Very weak shear (~15 knots
per TLX/INX VWP) will result in mostly unorganized convection,
although a few multicell clusters are possible. Isolated damaging
wind gusts will be possible, but no watch is anticipated.

0256 PM CDT Mon Aug 11 2025

Valid 112000Z - 121200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR PORTIONS OF
THE SOUTHERN GREAT PLAINS...LOWER MISSOURI VALLEY...AND UPPER
MIDWEST......

...SUMMARY...
Isolated strong to severe thunderstorms are possible across parts of
the southern Plains, lower Missouri Valley, and the Upper Midwest,
mainly this afternoon and evening.

...20Z Update...
Other than updates to the general thunderstorm forecast, the outlook
remains unchanged. See the previous discussion for more details.

..Wendt.. 08/11/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1112 AM CDT Mon Aug 11 2025/

...Lower MO Valley...
Visible satellite/radar composite shows an MCV moving
east-northeastward over northeast KS late this morning.  Regional
WSR-88D VAD data shows an enhanced belt of 850-500 mb flow (40 kt in
the 2-6 km layer) associated with this disturbance.  Surface
analysis places a surface low over the Flint Hills with backed
easterly flow across eastern KS into northwest MO.  Considerable
mid- to high-level cloud debris from early morning convection will
be slow to dissipate, but gradual filtering of sunlight and the
initial signs of a stratocumulus field over the Flint Hills
indicates destabilization is beginning to occur.  Models vary
considerably (understandably so) regarding the development/evolution
of a few potential stronger thunderstorms across the lower MO Valley
later this afternoon into the early evening.  Some forecast
soundings show modest enlargement of the low-level portion of the
hodograph, which may support updraft rotation if vigorous updraft
development occurs.  Given the low probability for severe and
potentially supportive environment, have introduced low-severe
probabilities this outlook update.

...Southern Plains...
Morning analysis shows an outflow reinforced front has advanced
southward across the southern High Plains, but has stalled near the
I-44 corridor in OK southwestward into the northern periphery of the
Permian Basin.  Water-vapor imagery shows a mid-level impulse moving
across southern CO and embedded within larger-scale troughing from
CO/NM into the Upper Midwest.  This mid-level trough will gradually
pivot eastward over the southern High Plains through the evening. 
Heating of an adequately moist boundary layer (dewpoints ranging
from the lower 70s in central OK to the mid 50s in east-central NM)
will yield moderate buoyancy near/north of the diffuse boundary. 
Weak low-level winds will gradually veer to west-northwesterly and
modestly strengthen with height through mid/upper levels, supporting
modest deep-layer shear and some updraft organization.

Isolated severe hail may occur with initially more cellular
development across the southern High Plains, before some clustering
potentially occurs late this afternoon/evening farther east into the
TX Panhandle and northwest TX with more of a wind threat.  While
deep-layer shear will likely remain weak farther east across OK, the
front/outflow boundary should aid in at least scattered
thunderstorms.  Isolated large hail and severe gusts are the primary
hazards with the stronger thunderstorms.

...North Dakota into Northern Minnesota...
No change in thinking from the previous forecast.  A mid-level
shortwave trough and related surface cold front are forecast to move
east-southeastward over ND and northern MN through the period.
Modest low-level moisture characterized by mid 50s to perhaps low
60s surface dewpoints should be present ahead of the front across
these areas. Diurnal heating and modestly steepened lapse rates
aloft should aid in the development of weak instability this
afternoon.  Thunderstorms should gradually increase in coverage
along/ahead of the front this afternoon/evening as they spread
eastward over parts of ND into northern MN. The stronger cells may
produce marginally severe hail, with sufficient deep-layer shear
present for some convective organization. With time, some
clustering/upscale growth along the front appears probable, with
isolated strong to severe gusts possible. The lack of stronger
instability should tend to temper the overall severe threat.

with recent hi-res guidance. See previous discussion below for more
information.

..Thornton.. 08/11/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0135 AM CDT Mon Aug 11 2025/

...Synopsis...
Isolated dry thunderstorms will remain the primary fire weather
concern for Tuesday across the country. Latest forecast guidance
hints that a deeply-mixed, but adequately buoyant, environment will
remain in place across central AZ on the northern fringe of deeper
monsoonal moisture. Forcing for ascent will be fairly weak and
largely driven by orographic ascent along the Mogollon Rim. However,
several deterministic CAM and recent HREF guidance hints at the
potential for at least a few thunderstorms. This thermodynamic
environment has yielded a mixture of wet and dry thunderstorms over
the past 24 hours, so a similar combination appears probable for
Tuesday. Fine fuels largely remain dry across the region, and recent
lightning-caused fires hint that the fuel environment should support
at least some fire starts. 

...Pacific Northwest...
A weak mid-level trough is forecast to move across the Pacific
Northwest on Tuesday. While flow aloft will be fairly modest, the
zonal flow over the Cascades and northern Sierra Nevada will likely
induce a downslope flow regime within an antecedent dry environment
with receptive fuels. Ensemble support was too limited to warrant
additional highlights, but localized elevated fire weather
conditions appear possible across far northwest NV, eastern OR, and
southern WA Tuesday afternoon.

Day 3 Convective Outlook

0227 PM CDT Mon Aug 11 2025

Valid 131200Z - 141200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS LATE WEDNESDAY
INTO WEDNESDAY NIGHT ACROSS MUCH OF CENTRAL AND EASTERN SOUTH DAKOTA
AND ADJACENT PORTIONS OF THE GREAT PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
The evolution of an organized cluster of thunderstorms accompanied
by strong to severe wind gusts appears possible across parts of
central through eastern South Dakota by Wednesday evening.

...Discussion...
Models indicate that the stronger westerlies will remain confined to
the northern mid-latitudes, mostly to the north of the Canadian/U.S.
border through this period.  One significant embedded short wave
trough shifting across Ontario through Quebec may become sheared
while becoming absorbed within an increasingly confluent regime,
preceded in lower latitudes by northeastward accelerating mid-level
troughing offshore of the Canadian Maritimes.  Upstream, another
significant short wave perturbation, initially digging near the
Canadian Rockies, is forecast to turn eastward across the Canadian
Prairies and provide support for significant lower/mid-tropospheric
cyclogenesis across southern Alberta through central/northern
Saskatchewan by late Wednesday night.  In lower latitudes ahead of
this feature, there appears a consensus among latest model output
that a much more subtle perturbation will dig east-southeast of the
northern U.S. Rockies late Wednesday through Wednesday night, within
weaker flow on the northern periphery of modest mid-level ridging.

...Northern Great Plains...
The NAM, with support from other model output, including the latest
ECMWF, depicts the evolution of a notable convective perturbation
Wednesday evening into Wednesday night across the central/eastern
South Dakota vicinity.  This appears focused where
lower/mid-tropospheric warm advection may become enhanced, near the
leading edge of a plume of warm, elevated mixed layer air advecting
eastward across the middle Missouri Valley, supported by a
strengthening nocturnal low-level jet.  Low-level moisture return to
the vicinity of deepening lee surface troughing may be seasonably
modest, but it still appears that sizable CAPE may develop across
parts of central South Dakota by late afternoon, near the nose of a
corridor of seasonably strong boundary-layer heating and deep
mixing, south through east of the Black Hills. 

It remains unclear whether stronger convective development will
initiate from late afternoon high-based thunderstorm development
near/north of the Black Hills, or perhaps an initial supercell
forming near a focused area of low-level convergence across central
South Dakota.  However, large-scale forcing for ascent probably will
lead to upscale growing convection by Wednesday evening, in an
environment conducive to a few strong downbursts, and a
consolidating, strengthening surface cold pool with potential to
produce a swath of strong to severe gusts.  It is possible that
severe probabilities may still need to be increased further in later
outlooks for this period.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1209 PM CDT Mon Aug 11 2025

Valid 121200Z - 131200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS TUESDAY INTO
TUESDAY NIGHT ACROSS PARTS OF EASTERN WISCONSIN...UPPER AND LOWER
MICHIGAN...AND PARTS OF NORTHEASTERN ILLINOIS...NORTHERN
INDIANA...NORTHWESTERN OHIO...

...SUMMARY...
Strong thunderstorms may impact parts of the upper Great Lakes
region Tuesday into Tuesday evening, accompanied by at least some
risk for severe wind and hail.

...Discussion...
The westerlies will remain confined to the northern mid-latitudes,
but models suggest that flow near/north of the Canadian/U.S. border
will trend a bit more zonal, as an initially prominent mid-level
high centered offshore of the Pacific Northwest continues to become
suppressed west-southwestward across the northeastern Pacific. 
Within this regime, models continue to indicate the consolidation of
several short wave perturbations into larger-scale mid-level
troughing across Ontario into Quebec by late Tuesday night,
accompanied by significant surface cyclogenesis across far northern
Ontario into the southern Hudson/James Bay vicinity.

In lower levels, a modest initial intrusion of cooler/drier air may
overspread much of the Dakotas and portions of the Upper Midwest and
adjacent Great Lakes region by 12Z Tuesday, before slowly advancing
east-southeastward across the upper Great Lakes and eventually being
overtaken by a more substantive cool intrusion later Tuesday through
Tuesday night.  Complicating matters with respect to
destabilization, guidance continues to indicate that the lead front
will be preceded by a stalled lingering remnant frontal zone, which
may still be reinforced by convective precipitation/outflow across
parts of southern Lower Michigan and northern Illinois, into the
lower Missouri Valley and the southern Great Plains, at the outset
of the period.

...Upper Great Lakes...
Short wave developments within the evolving pattern remain unclear
due to spread within the various model output, but guidance
continues to indicate that one notable short wave impulse will
continue digging across parts of the Upper Midwest and adjacent
Great Lakes region during the day Tuesday, before pivoting across
and east-northeast of Lake Huron/Georgian Bay.  It appears that this
may be preceded by one or two convectively generated perturbations
which will become increasing sheared while merging into the
southwesterly cyclonic mid-level regime overspreading the Great
Lakes vicinity.

As this occurs, various model output (notably including calibrated
thunderstorm probability guidance from the High Resolution Ensemble
system) suggests that destabilization and forcing for ascent will
become supportive of a couple of corridors of increasing
thunderstorm development by late Tuesday afternoon.  These generally
coincide with the stalled remnant frontal zone across parts of
southeastern Lower Michigan into northeastern Illinois and the
initial cold front advancing across Upper Michigan/eastern
Wisconsin.

Along the southern boundary, which may strengthen some with
differential surface heating, mid-level thermodynamic profiles may
be relatively warm with weak lapse rates.  However, it still appears
that seasonably high boundary-layer moisture content, coupled with
daytime heating, will contribute to sizable CAPE.  Coinciding with a
belt of strengthening southwesterly lower/mid-level flow (including
30-40 kt in the 700-500 mb layer), the environment may become
conducive to organized convection, including evolving supercell
structures and upscale growing clusters with potential to produce
strong to severe wind gusts by late Tuesday afternoon into evening.

Across Upper Michigan into eastern Wisconsin, pre-frontal
destabilization remains more unclear due to the possible influence
of convective cloud cover and/or outflow.  But, with breaks in cloud
cover allowing for a narrow corridor of heating, cooling aloft and
strengthening shear along the frontal zone might contribute to an
environment conducive to strong thunderstorm development with
potential to produce marginally severe hail and localized strong
surface gusts late Tuesday afternoon. 

...Southwest...
Forecast deep-layer mean wind fields are generally light, but
include a west-northwesterly upslope component to the low-level flow
beneath north-northeasterly mid-level flow.  This may aid
propagation of convection off the higher terrain of southwestern New
Mexico and southeastern Arizona, into lower elevations with a warm
and deeply mixed boundary layer characterized by modest potential
instability by late Tuesday afternoon.  As this occurs, a few strong
to severe downbursts and gusts along strengthening outflows appears
possible.

Valid 111700Z - 121200Z

Minor adjustments were made to the D1 Fire Weather Outlook Isolated
Dry Thunderstorm area across Arizona in alignment with trends in
recent guidance. See previous discussion below for more information.

..Thornton.. 08/11/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0104 AM CDT Mon Aug 11 2025/

...Synopsis...
Somewhat limited fire weather concerns are expected today across the
Southwest/Four Corners region. Very dry conditions will persist
across the eastern Great Basin/Four Corners with widespread 5-15% RH
minimums expected this afternoon. However, low-level winds are
expected to be somewhat weaker today compared to previous days as a
surface high gradually builds across the Intermountain west.
Sustained winds between 10-15 mph will likely be accompanied by
15-25 mph gusts by around peak heating when boundary-layer mixing
will be maximized, but confidence in sustained elevated conditions
remains too limited to warrant highlights. 

Instead, fire weather concerns will manifest as another day of dry
thunderstorm potential along the Mogollon Rim. Lightning data and
MRMS imagery from the past 24 hours shows a mixture of heavy
precipitation cores (QPE values near 0.25 inch) as well as multiple
dry lightning strikes. Additionally, a couple of small fire starts
were noted over the past 24 hours due to lightning. Similar
thermodynamic conditions will be in place this afternoon and will
likely yield a similar mixture of wet and dry thunderstorms.
Unlikely previous days, thunderstorm coverage may be more limited
due to weaker synoptic-scale forcing for ascent.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1112 AM CDT Mon Aug 11 2025

Valid 111630Z - 121200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR PORTIONS OF
THE SOUTHERN GREAT PLAINS...LOWER MISSOURI VALLEY...AND UPPER
MIDWEST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated strong to severe thunderstorms are possible across parts of
the southern Plains, lower Missouri Valley, and the Upper Midwest,
mainly this afternoon and evening.

...Lower MO Valley...
Visible satellite/radar composite shows an MCV moving
east-northeastward over northeast KS late this morning.  Regional
WSR-88D VAD data shows an enhanced belt of 850-500 mb flow (40 kt in
the 2-6 km layer) associated with this disturbance.  Surface
analysis places a surface low over the Flint Hills with backed
easterly flow across eastern KS into northwest MO.  Considerable
mid- to high-level cloud debris from early morning convection will
be slow to dissipate, but gradual filtering of sunlight and the
initial signs of a stratocumulus field over the Flint Hills
indicates destabilization is beginning to occur.  Models vary
considerably (understandably so) regarding the development/evolution
of a few potential stronger thunderstorms across the lower MO Valley
later this afternoon into the early evening.  Some forecast
soundings show modest enlargement of the low-level portion of the
hodograph, which may support updraft rotation if vigorous updraft
development occurs.  Given the low probability for severe and
potentially supportive environment, have introduced low-severe
probabilities this outlook update.

...Southern Plains...
Morning analysis shows an outflow reinforced front has advanced
southward across the southern High Plains, but has stalled near the
I-44 corridor in OK southwestward into the northern periphery of the
Permian Basin.  Water-vapor imagery shows a mid-level impulse moving
across southern CO and embedded within larger-scale troughing from
CO/NM into the Upper Midwest.  This mid-level trough will gradually
pivot eastward over the southern High Plains through the evening. 
Heating of an adequately moist boundary layer (dewpoints ranging
from the lower 70s in central OK to the mid 50s in east-central NM)
will yield moderate buoyancy near/north of the diffuse boundary. 
Weak low-level winds will gradually veer to west-northwesterly and
modestly strengthen with height through mid/upper levels, supporting
modest deep-layer shear and some updraft organization.

Isolated severe hail may occur with initially more cellular
development across the southern High Plains, before some clustering
potentially occurs late this afternoon/evening farther east into the
TX Panhandle and northwest TX with more of a wind threat.  While
deep-layer shear will likely remain weak farther east across OK, the
front/outflow boundary should aid in at least scattered
thunderstorms.  Isolated large hail and severe gusts are the primary
hazards with the stronger thunderstorms.

...North Dakota into Northern Minnesota...
No change in thinking from the previous forecast.  A mid-level
shortwave trough and related surface cold front are forecast to move
east-southeastward over ND and northern MN through the period.
Modest low-level moisture characterized by mid 50s to perhaps low
60s surface dewpoints should be present ahead of the front across
these areas. Diurnal heating and modestly steepened lapse rates
aloft should aid in the development of weak instability this
afternoon.  Thunderstorms should gradually increase in coverage
along/ahead of the front this afternoon/evening as they spread
eastward over parts of ND into northern MN. The stronger cells may
produce marginally severe hail, with sufficient deep-layer shear
present for some convective organization. With time, some
clustering/upscale growth along the front appears probable, with
isolated strong to severe gusts possible. The lack of stronger
instability should tend to temper the overall severe threat.

Post-Tropical Cyclone Ivo Discussion Number  20
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092025
800 AM PDT Mon Aug 11 2025
 
The last bit of convection associated with Ivo dissipated about 15 
hours ago, and it has therefore degenerated into a remnant low.  
Maximum winds are estimated to be 25 kt, and further weakening is 
forecast as the system moves over colder waters.  Ivo is expected 
to open up into a trough--and thus dissipate--in about 36 hours, as 
depicted in global model fields.  Until that time, a low-level 
ridge to the north is expected to steer the remnant low westward at 
about 10 kt, and no major changes were made to the official track 
forecast.

Isolated strong to severe thunderstorms may pose some risk for
severe winds and hail across parts of the southern Plains, and
separately from North Dakota into northern Minnesota, mainly this
afternoon and evening.

...Southern Plains...
Convection has generally weakened this morning across eastern KS,
with a outflow reinforced front advancing southward across the
southern High Plains. This boundary is forecast to stall through the
morning and early afternoon, and it will likely serve as a focus for
renewed thunderstorm development later today. The southern extent of
upper troughing that exists over much of the Plains is forecast to
advance eastward across the southern High Plains this afternoon.
Initial development over the higher terrain of north-central into
northeast NM should occur in a modest low-level upslope flow regime,
with steep lapse rates aloft contributing to moderate instability.
Weak low-level winds will gradually veer to west-northwesterly and
modestly strengthen with height through mid/upper levels, supporting
modest deep-layer shear and some updraft organization.

Isolated severe hail may occur with initially more cellular
development across the southern High Plains, before some clustering
potentially occurs late this afternoon/evening farther east into the
TX Panhandle and northwest TX with more of a wind threat. While
deep-layer shear will likely remain weak farther east across OK, the
front/outflow boundary should aid in at least scattered
thunderstorms developing with moderate to locally strong instability
amid ample daytime heating. Isolated damaging winds via strong
downbursts and marginally severe hail appear possible with the
stronger cores given seasonably cool temperatures aloft (around -10C
at 500 mb with the 12Z OUN observed sounding), and the Marginal Risk
has been expanded eastward for this possibility.

...North Dakota into Northern Minnesota...
Within upper troughing already established over the northern/central
Plains and central Canada, a mid-level shortwave trough and related
surface cold front are forecast to move east-southeastward over ND
and northern MN through the period. Modest low-level moisture
characterized by mid 50s to perhaps low 60s surface dewpoints should
be present ahead of the front across these areas. Diurnal heating
and modestly steepened lapse rates aloft should aid in the
development of weak instability this afternoon. Thunderstorms should
gradually increase in coverage along/ahead of the front this
afternoon/evening as they spread eastward over parts of ND into
northern MN. The stronger cells may produce marginally severe hail,
with sufficient deep-layer shear present for some convective
organization. With time, some clustering/upscale growth along the
front appears probable, with isolated strong to severe gusts
possible. The lack of stronger instability should tend to temper the
overall severe threat.

...Missouri/Iowa...
An MCV generated by overnight/early morning convection across the
southern/central Plains should develop northeastward into parts of
northern MO and IA by this afternoon. It remains unclear whether
sufficient instability to support robust thunderstorms will be able
to develop today ahead of this feature given ongoing convection and
cloud debris. Regardless, some enhancement to the low/mid-level flow
and related deep-layer shear could support updraft organization if
surface-based thunderstorms can develop. Given the continued
uncertainty regarding this potential, have held off on inclusion of
low severe probabilities across this region with this update.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0352 AM CDT Mon Aug 11 2025

Valid 141200Z - 191200Z

...DISCUSSION...
On Thursday/D4, a shortwave trough is forecast to move from MT into
the northern Plains, with primary upper low well to the north. A
surface trough and cold front should push eastward across the
Dakotas as well, and extend roughly from MN into NE by Friday/D5
morning. Model spread is high regarding the amount of moisture
return and instability, with some models likely over-estimating real
instability. In any case, storms appear most likely from ND into
northern MN, beneath 50+ kt midlevel westerlies. As such, a 15%
severe area has been introduced.

This wave will progress east/northeastward on Friday/D5, with a
front trailing southwestward perhaps from Lake Superior across WI/MN
and toward NE. A moist and unstable air mass will remain near and
south of any such boundary, but the position of said boundary may
depend on storms from the previous night, or possibly a continuation
of such storms. Predictability is therefore low on Friday/D5.

Beyond this time frame, it appears the storm track will shift
northward into Canada, with upper ridging over much of the CONUS.

Hurricane Henriette Discussion Number  29
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   EP082025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 PM HST Sun Aug 10 2025
 
The satellite presentation of Henriette had degraded earlier this 
evening, perhaps due to what appeared to be an eye wall replacement 
cycle, while the cyclone was also passing over a tongue of slightly 
cooler sea surface temperatures around 25.5C.  Recent satellite 
images however depict the eye becoming better defined and surrounded 
by cooling cloud tops.  The most recent subjective Dvorak current 
intensity estimates were 4.0/65 kt from PHFO and SAB, and 4.5/77 kt 
from JTWC.  Meanwhile, the objective estimates from UW-CIMSS have 
ranged between 65 and 76 kt during the past several hours.  Taking a 
blend of these estimates, the initial intensity has been held at 70 
kt for this advisory.
 
Henriette is moving toward the northwest, or 315 degrees, at 15 kt. 
This general motion is expected to continue during the next couple 
of days as the cyclone is steered between a mid-level low to the 
northwest of Hawaii and a building mid-level ridge far to the north 
of the cyclone.  A turn toward the north and a decrease in forward 
speed is expected beyond 60 hours as the increasingly shallow system 
is steered by a low to mid-level ridge to the east.  The official 
track forecast is near the middle of the guidance envelope and is 
very close to the previous advisory.
 
Henriette will remain over sufficiently warm water for some 
intensification during the next day or so, however, vertical wind 
shear is forecast to increase considerably by about 36 hours.  As a 
result, the official forecast calls for some strengthening during 
the next 24 hours, followed by slight weakening between 24 and 36 
hours, and more rapid weakening thereafter.  Henriette is expected 
to weaken into a post-tropical low by 72 hours, with dissipation 
expected by 120 hours.  The intensity forecast is mostly unchanged 
and is slightly higher than the intensity guidance in the near term, 
then close to the middle of the intensity guidance envelope beyond 
36 hours.

Tropical Depression Ivo Discussion Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092025
200 AM PDT Mon Aug 11 2025

Ivo has become devoid of deep convection as it moves over 
increasingly cooler waters and into a drier air mass.  The current 
intensity estimate is 30 kt which could be a bit generous based on 
partial scatterometer overpasses.

The motion continues west-northwestward, or around 295/9 kt.  Ivo 
should remain embedded in low-level easterly flow for the next day 
or two.  The track forecast is similar to that from the previous 
advisory and very close to the latest corrected consensus, HCCA, 
solution.

Since the system is expected to traverse even cooler waters during 
the next 36 hours or so, it is unlikely to regenerate significant 
deep convection.  Thus the cyclone will likely become a 
post-tropical remnant low very soon.  The global models depict 
the system opening up into a trough within 48 hours and this is 
reflected in the official forecast.

Hurricane Henriette Discussion Number  27
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   EP082025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 AM HST Sun Aug 10 2025

Henriette has put on quite the show today with a well-defined eye 
emerging during the past few hours along with cooling temperatures 
in the eyewall.  Dvorak intensity estimates were up to 65 kt by 
18Z, and with the further development on satellite since that time, 
the initial wind speed is set to 70 kt for this advisory. 

It remains to be seen how strong Henriette will get with an 
improving environment along its path during the next day or so, 
including decreasing shear, increasing SSTs and cooling upper-level 
temperatures.  Given that this rapid intensification period was not 
well forecast, and a recent closed 37 GHz ring on AMSR2 data, I'm 
inclined to go above the guidance in this situation and show near 
rapid intensification for about 24 h until the environment becomes 
more hostile.  Henriette should lose all deep convection in about 3 
days over cold waters and in very high shear.
 
The storm is moving northwestward at about 15 kt.  A large ridge
over the north-central Pacific should cause a continued fast
northwestward track of Henriette for several days until its slows 
down a bit near dissipation.  The only minor change to the previous 
forecast is a faster forward speed, probably a function of the 
hurricane feeling stronger upper-level southeasterly flow during 
the next couple of days.

Tropical Storm Ivo Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092025
200 PM PDT Sun Aug 10 2025
 
Even over waters of 23-24 degrees Celsius, Ivo is managing to 
maintain a persistent area of deep convection.  A recent ASCAT pass 
showed maximum winds of 30 kt.  Accounting for the instrument's 
sampling limitations, and combined with satellite estimates still 
running around 35 kt, it is estimated that Ivo is hanging on to 
tropical storm status.  Sea surface temperatures drop by another 2-3 
degrees along Ivo's forecast track, so weakening is expected to 
resume tonight, and simulated satellite images from the GFS and 
ECMWF show that deep convection could finally be gone by Monday 
morning.  Degeneration into a remnant low is forecast by 24 hours, 
followed by dissipation into a trough in 60 hours.
 
Ivo is moving west-northwestward (285 deg) at 10 kt.  This motion 
should continue for the next 12 hours, followed by a slight bend to 
the west in 24 hours as Ivo stays situated to the south of the low- 
to mid-level ridge.  The track models are tightly clustered, and 
the new NHC forecast is mainly an update of the previous 
prediction.

Tropical Storm Ivo Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092025
200 AM MST Sun Aug 10 2025

Ivo is weakening while it passes over the cooler waters well to the 
west of Baja California Sur, and its associated deep convection 
is gradually decreasing in coverage and intensity.  Data from an 
excellent scatterometer overpass just before 0500 UTC showed that 
the maximum winds have decreased to near 35 kt.  Subjective Dvorak 
analyses from TAFB and SAB, along with objective Dvorak values from 
UW-CIMSS gave a similar intensity estimate, indicating that Ivo is 
now at minimal tropical storm strength.

Center fixes indicate that the cyclone continues to move 
west-northwestward, or at about 285/7 kt.  A low- to mid-level 
ridge is predicted to remain to the north of Ivo during the next 
couple of days.  The system is likely to turn more westward with a 
slight increase in forward speed in a day or so as the increasingly 
shallow circulation becomes steered by the low-level easterlies.  
The official forecast track is very similar to the one from the 
previous advisory.

Ivo is moving over cooler waters with gradually decreasing 
environmental moisture.  Therefore weakening should continue, and 
the system will likely degenerate into a post-tropical remnant low 
in 24 hours or so.  The intensity forecast is similar to the 
previous NHC forecast and near the high end of the model guidance.

Tropical Storm Henriette Discussion Number  25
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   EP082025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 PM HST Sat Aug 09 2025
 
Satellite imagery shows that Henriette retains a well-organized 
low-level structure, with a curved band wrapping around the west 
side of the circulation. However, convection within the band has 
struggled to persist due to surrounding dry mid- to upper-level air. 
Subjective Dvorak current intensity estimates from SAB, JTWC, and 
HFO, along with objective estimates from UW-CIMSS, support holding 
the initial intensity at 35 kt for this advisory.

The initial motion is toward the northwest at 13 kt, steered by a 
subtropical ridge to the northeast and an amplifying mid-latitude 
trough to the northwest. Henriette’s forward speed is expected to 
increase through 36 hours, level off near 60 hours, and then slow 
through 96 hours as the steering flow weakens. This motion will keep 
Henriette well northeast of the Hawaiian Islands. Guidance indicates 
the sharp upper trough will cut off into an upper low on Monday and 
retrograde westward, a pattern that should maintain Henriette’s 
northwestward motion. The track forecast is very similar to the 
previous one but is slightly left of the earlier forecast from days 
3 to 4, and lies near the middle of the tightly clustered consensus 
aids.

Sea-surface temperatures along Henriette’s forecast track should 
gradually warm from near 25 degrees C to around 26–27 degrees C 
through about 60 h. Despite surrounding dry mid- to upper-level air, 
a combination of warmer waters and increasing upper-level divergence 
associated with an upper trough to the northwest should enhance 
outflow and support gradual strengthening. The NHC forecast 
continues to show a peak near 55 kt in the 36–48 h period, nearly 
identical to the previous forecast and within the middle to upper 
end of the guidance envelope. Thereafter, cooler waters, increasing 
shear, and diminishing upper-level outflow should result in steady 
weakening, with Henriette expected to become a post-tropical remnant 
low by 96 h and dissipate by 120 h as it is absorbed into the 
mid-latitude flow.

...LIKELY TO BECOME A REMNANT LOW IN A DAY OR SO...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 200 AM MST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...21.5N 114.9W
ABOUT 335 MI...535 KM WSW OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...40 MPH...65 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 285 DEGREES AT 8 MPH...13 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1006 MB...29.71 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM MST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ivo was
located near latitude 21.5 North, longitude 114.9 West. Ivo is
moving toward the west-northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h).  A gradual
turn toward the west with a slight increase in forward speed is
expected through early next week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Continued weakening is anticipated, and Ivo is forecast to become a 
post-tropical remnant low during the next day or so.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Ivo will continue to affect the southern
portion of the Baja California peninsula during the next day or so.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather
office.
