Mesoscale Discussion 0281
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0611 AM CDT Fri Mar 22 2024

Areas affected...Northeast IA to the IL/WI border

Concerning...Heavy snow 

Valid 221111Z - 221515Z

SUMMARY...A narrow band of heavy snow developing in north-central
Iowa should shift east across parts of northeast Iowa towards the
Illinois-Wisconsin border through late morning. Rates of 1-2"/hr
should be expected, but may remain of relatively short-duration at
any one location.

DISCUSSION...The north side of a high-reflectivity convective plume
across central IA appears to have finally cooled enough to maintain
all snow to the surface, per recent surface observations and DOT
cameras. 03Z SREF probabilities and 00Z HREF snowbands guidance have
been highly insistent that a relatively narrow (around 25 miles
wide) heavy snow band should translate east, likely centered on the
US-20 corridor per observational trends. This suggests heavy snow
will be of relatively short duration at any one location, but
snowfall rates should easily reach 1-2"/hr given the focused 700-mb
frontogenesis beneath the dendritic growth zone and the deep, nearly
isothermal layer just below freezing to the surface.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0358 AM CDT Fri Mar 22 2024

Valid 251200Z - 301200Z

...DISCUSSION...
A highly amplified upper trough, with multiple embedded shortwaves,
appears likely to continue progressing eastward across the
western/central CONUS early next week. One such shortwave trough
should move quickly northeastward across the Upper Midwest while
becoming increasingly displaced from the surface warm sector.
Another, southern-stream shortwave trough is forecast to advance
across northern Mexico and the southern Plains into the lower MS
Valley and Southeast from Day 4/Monday into Day 5/Tuesday. A
consensus of the latest deterministic and ensemble guidance shows a
somewhat slower ejection of the southern-stream shortwave trough,
and related placement of a surface cold front. Accordingly, greater
low-level moisture may not advance as far northward across the lower
MS Valley as previously expected. The 15% severe delineation for
Monday has been adjusted accordingly, and highlights the area where
confidence is greatest that weak, but sufficient, instability will
overlap with strong low-level and deep-layer shear. A risk of
supercells/bowing line segments and tornadoes should exist Monday
through Monday night from parts of east TX into LA/MS and vicinity,
along and south of a warm front and secondary surface low
development.

The embedded shortwave trough should move north-northeastward across
the lower MS Valley into the TN/OH Valleys on Tuesday. Greater
low-level moisture (60s surface dewpoints) will likely remain
confined to portions of the central Gulf Coast states, namely
southeastern LA into southern/central MS/AL and the FL Panhandle.
These areas will perhaps have the best potential for a continuation
of the Monday severe threat into Tuesday. But, there are concerns
that the convection will outpace the low-level moisture return. Will
defer the possible inclusion of a 15% severe area for Tuesday across
this region to a later outlook, pending greater confidence that
convection will be able to maintain its intensity and remain
surface-based. For Day 6/Wednesday and beyond, potential for a
continuation of the severe threat across parts of the southeastern
states becomes even more uncertain.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0746 AM CDT Thu Mar 21 2024

Valid 211300Z - 221200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS TODAY INTO EARLY
TONIGHT FOR SOUTHEAST TX...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms producing large hail and strong wind
gusts are possible from the northwest Gulf coast into central Texas.

...TX area through tonight...
Elevated thunderstorm development is underway this morning over the
middle TX coastal plain, near and just north of a coastal front. 
Per the 12z CRP/BRO soundings, the environment is sufficient for a
couple of slightly elevated supercells capable of producing isolated
1-2 inch diameter hail and gusts up to 60 mph.  The storms are
expected to gradually grow upscale in the warm advection regime
through the morning, with the likelihood that a cluster/MCS will
evolve and move offshore toward midday/early afternoon.

Farther west, a midlevel shortwave trough over west TX/NM will
progress eastward to central TX this evening, accompanied by a weak
surface reflection.  Surface heating in cloud breaks and
boundary-layer dewpoints in the 55-60 F range will boost MLCAPE into
the 500-1000 J/kg range across central into northwest TX.  The
destabilization and weakening convective inhibition, in combination
with the zone of ascent preceding the midlevel trough, will support
scattered thunderstorm development by mid afternoon (~20-21z). 
Steepening low-midlevel lapse rates and modestly long/relatively
straight hodographs (effective bulk shear 25-35 kt) will favor a mix
of clusters and some supercell structures capable of producing
isolated large hail (1-1.5 inches) and outflow gusts of 50-60 mph. 
The convection will subsequently spread east-southeastward across
central TX this evening and into southeast TX and possibly far
southwest LA tonight.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 57
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
625 AM CDT Thu Mar 21 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Middle Texas Coastal Plain
  Coastal Waters

* Effective this Thursday morning and afternoon from 625 AM until
  100 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2
    inches in diameter possible
  Isolated damaging wind gusts to 60 mph possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms will increase in coverage/intensity this
morning while spreading east and northeastward near the middle Texas
Coast.  A couple of slightly elevated supercells will be possible,
with the potential to produce 1-2 inch diameter hail and isolated
damaging gusts near 60 mph.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 50
statute miles east and west of a line from 50 miles south of
Victoria TX to 45 miles northwest of Angleton TX. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU7).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 50 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
26020.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1204 PM CDT Sun Mar 17 2024

Valid 181200Z - 191200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS
OF THE FLORIDA PENINSULA...

...SUMMARY...
Strong thunderstorms may move inland off the Gulf of Mexico into
portions of the northern and central Florida peninsula early Monday.
Additional thunderstorms may develop during the afternoon along the
east-central and southeast Florida coast. Strong gusts and hail may
accompany this activity.

...FL Peninsula...

An upper trough over the Great Lakes and MS Valley will pivot
east/southeast across the eastern U.S. on Monday. Forecast guidance
depicts a shortwave perturbation in the base of the trough over the
northern Gulf of Mexico shifting east across northern/north-central
FL Monday morning. Deep-layer westerly flow will increase with
southward extent across the FL Panhandle through the afternoon, with
30-40 kt 850-700 mb flow common ahead of southward-sagging surface
boundary. 

Showers and thunderstorms may be ongoing across parts of
north-central FL Monday morning. Gusty winds may accompany this
activity as it spreads east the first few hours of the forecast
period. A more conditional severe thunderstorm risk may develop
during the afternoon further south across parts of the
east-central/southeast coast. 

The NAM appears to be an outlier with the strength of an EML,
maintaining capping through the period. The RAP/HRRR/GFS show weaker
capping around 700 mb with full erosion of the cap by afternoon.
Given favorable vertical shear (0-6 effective shear around 40 kt),
steep midlevel lapse rates (around 7-7.5 C/km) and MLCAPE around
1500-2000 J/kg, at least a conditional risk for a couple of severe
storms appears plausible. Large-scale ascent will remain weak over
the area, and veered low-level flow will limit low-level convergence
along the southward-developing surface front. If a well-defined sea
breeze develops along the southeast Peninsula, this could allow for
a few storms to develop during the afternoon/early evening, posing a
conditional risk for large hail and strong gusts. For this reason,
have expanded the Marginal risk (level 1 of 5) to encompass the
southeast Peninsula.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0115 AM CDT Sun Mar 17 2024/

...Synopsis...
During the day on Sunday, mid-level pattern will be characterized by
a digging longwave trough over the central and eastern US with a
cutoff low in the southwest US. This will promote cool, northerly
surface flow across much of the central US and precipitation across
parts of the southern High Plains. As such, aside from perhaps some
locally Elevated fire risk in parts of southwest Kansas and
northwest Oklahoma, fire concerns are expected to be minimal.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM THE MOUTH
OF THE MISSISSIPPI TO THE FLORIDA BIG BEND...

...SUMMARY...
Local/isolated risk for gusty/damaging winds remains possible today
from southeastern Louisiana to the Florida Panhandle/Big Bend area.

...Gulf Coastal area from southeastern Louisiana to the Florida Big
Bend...
A well-defined MCS with embedded MCV is moving eastward across the
southeastern Louisiana vicinity late this morning, along the
west-to-east synoptic cold front lying roughly across the Gulf Coast
region.  

West of this convective complex, weak quasi-geostrophic ascent
across Texas -- within a zone of modest low-level warm advection
beneath minor mid-level disturbances moving through fast
west-southwesterly flow aloft southeast of the Desert Southwest
upper low -- will support occasional deep convection.  However,
aside from a couple of sporadic stronger storms and possibly
brief/marginally severe hail/wind risk locally, risk appears too low
to require inclusion of probabilities in the current outlook.

East of the MCS, limited severe risk remains apparent across coastal
areas, though the strongest storms should remain over the northern
Gulf.  Still, gusty/locally damaging winds may occur, warranting
continuation of 5% wind probability as far east as the Florida Big
Bend region through tonight.
