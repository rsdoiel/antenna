Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0301 PM CDT Fri May 09 2025

Valid 101200Z - 111200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Northern Plains...
Surface lee trough development across the Saskatchewan/Alberta
Canadian provinces will promote increasing south-southwest winds
across the Northern Plains Saturday. A dry boundary layer present
over receptive fuels combined with south-southwest winds of 10-20
mph will support elevated fire weather conditions across
northeastern Montana and western North Dakota where Elevated
highlights were introduced. The driest surface conditions are
expected across eastern Montana with stronger low-level winds offset
farther east in the Dakotas. 

...Southeast Arizona and far Southwest New Mexico...
Surface high pressure across the Colorado Plateau along with
inverted surface trough across Baja California will support elevated
southeast winds across southeastern Arizona and far southwest New
Mexico. Relative humidity is expected to drop close to 10 percent in
some lower elevation areas. These winds and low relative humidity,
combined with dry fuels in an area of extreme drought, supports
addition of Elevated highlights within this area.

..Williams.. 05/09/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0158 AM CDT Fri May 09 2025/

...Synopsis...
An upper ridge will shift into the Plains on Saturday, as a compact
shortwave trough exits the Northeast. Beneath the building ridge, an
upper low will meander about the Southeastern US as the mid-level
flow pattern remains blocked. Troughing will slowly deepen over the
eastern Pacific amplifying the upper-level pattern.

...Northern Plains...
Despite the relatively stagnant upper air pattern strong flow aloft
will begin to move over the Ridge across the Rockies and into the
northern US. This will support slow deepening of a lee trough
Saturday afternoon. Low-level winds will veer to southerly and
strengthen through the weekend as dry surface conditions develop.
While widespread critical RH and winds are not expected, a few hours
of southerly gusts of 15-20 mph and RH below 35% are possible. This
appears most likely over parts of the Dakotas and western MN. As
fuels continue to dry, locally elevated fire-weather conditions may
develop. However, the lack of stronger winds and overlap with the
driest fuels should prevent more widespread concerns for Saturday.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0258 PM CDT Fri May 09 2025

Valid 092000Z - 101200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM THE EASTERN
FLORIDA PENINSULA INTO SOUTHEAST GEORGIA AND FAR SOUTHERN SOUTH
CAROLINA...AND ACROSS EASTERN NORTH CAROLINA/FAR SOUTHEAST
VIRGINIA...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms capable of producing large hail and severe wind gusts
are possible across parts of the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast,
especially from the eastern Florida Peninsula through southeast
Georgia, and across northeastern North Carolina/far southeast
Virginia.

...20Z Update...
No changes were made to the forecast with this update. For details
on the near-term severe risks in the Mid-Atlantic and
northern/central FL, reference MCDs #753 and #754. For the overnight
and early morning time frame, a locally favorable corridor for
tornadoes/waterspouts may develop in the vicinity of the western FL
Panhandle -- focused ahead of a well-defined MCV tracking eastward
across the north-central Gulf. However, confidence in adding higher
tornado probabilities is too low at this time, given
ongoing/additional convection and related boundary-layer
overturning.

..Weinman.. 05/09/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1130 AM CDT Fri May 09 2025/

...Synopsis...
Recent satellite imagery shows a pair of cyclones embedded within a
large positively titled upper trough extending from the southern
Plains through the Northeast. The northernmost/easternmost cyclone
is centered over the Lower Great Lakes vicinity, and is forecast to
move gradually eastward throughout the day, ending the period over
southern New England. An associated surface low, which is currently
centered over eastern NJ, is forecast to progress northeastward
while becoming increasingly aligned with the mid-level cyclone. A
cold front extends southwestward from this low across VA and then
back westward across KY, southern IL, and central MO. As the low
moves northeastward, this front is expected to gradually push
southward/southeastward, moving through much of the Mid-Atlantic by
this evening. 

The southernmost/westernmost embedded cyclone is currently centered
over southern AR, and the expectation is for the cyclone to shift
southeastward throughout the day, ending the period over the Lower
MS Valley. Primary surface low associated with this system is
currently over the northwest Gulf. This low is forecast to progress
slowly eastward along the central Gulf coast, remaining just off
shore and likely reaching just off AL/MS border intersection by
early tomorrow morning.

...Central Gulf Coast into FL...
A modest, convectively enhanced vorticity maximum is forecast to
move from the central FL Panhandle into southeast GA/northern FL
today, well ahead of the mid-level cyclone and associated surface
low described in the synopsis. Localized ascent attendant to this
features coupled with modest large-scale forcing for ascent and
airmass destabilization will result in early-afternoon thunderstorm
development, particularly along any sea breeze boundary that
develops. Vertical shear will be modest, resulting in a mostly
multicellular mode. Even so, updrafts are still expected to be
strong enough to produce damaging downbursts and isolated large
hail.

Later tonight, some additional organization/strengthening of a
convective line near the surface low is possible. Some strengthening
of the low-level flow could occur at the same time, resulting in a
low-probability tornado risk along the coast from AL into the
western and central FL Peninsula. 

...Mid-Atlantic into the Carolinas...
Afternoon thunderstorm development is anticipated across the region,
with the highest coverage from the VA Tidewater into east-central
NC, where forcing along the cold front will be strongest. The
strongest shear is anticipated across this region as well, but the
overall magnitude should still be modest, with most guidance
suggesting deep-layer shear around 35 kt. Buoyancy will be modest as
well, with MLCAPE likely maximizing around 800 to 1000 J/kg. These
environmental conditions support the potential for a few stronger,
more organized updrafts capable of damaging wind gusts and isolated
large hail.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0229 PM CDT Fri May 09 2025

Valid 111200Z - 121200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS PARTS OF THE
NORTHERN ROCKIES AND HIGH PLAINS...AND OVER PARTS OF THE
SOUTHEAST...

...SUMMARY...
Widely scattered strong thunderstorms may impact the eastern Gulf
coast region on Sunday, posing at least some risk for severe hail
and locally strong surface gusts. Additional thunderstorms may be
accompanied by strong gusts across parts of the northern Rockies and
High Plains late Sunday afternoon and evening.

...Synopsis...
An upper low will remain nearly stationary over LA, providing cool
temperatures aloft from TX into the Gulf Coast region. Moderate
southwest winds aloft will remain over the eastern Gulf and
overspread much of AL, GA, and FL late. Low pressure and numerous
storms will affect those same states for much of the day.

To the west, an upper trough over the Pacific Northwest will deepen
further, with a 70 kt midlevel jet nosing into central MT. A surface
trough will deepen over the northern High Plains, and extending west
across MT and into ID, with steep lapse rates supporting scattered
thunderstorms. 

...Southern MS/AL/GA into FL...
Numerous storms will likely be ongoing throughout the day over the
northeast Gulf and spreading into AL, northern FL and GA. Scattered
strong wind gusts may occur with these outflows. Farther west,
daytime storms may also develop over MS and AL where heating occurs
beneath the cool temperatures aloft. Sporadic hail or strong gusts
may occur.

...Northern  High Plains...
As the upper trough overspreads the region, steepening lapse rates
will result in a large area of potential thunderstorm threat.
Strengthening southwest flow aloft will also conditionally support
cellular activity with marginal hail or localized severe gusts. At
this time, will maintain the existing Marginal Risk over eastern MT
near the lee trough. Additional parts of MT or even ID and northwest
WY may eventually need to be added to the Marginal Risk area in
later outlooks.

Valid 101200Z - 111200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PARTS OF
FLORIDA...SOUTHERN GEORGIA AND ALABAMA...AND INTO CENTRAL MONTANA...

...SUMMARY...
Strong thunderstorms may impact parts of northern and central
Florida and adjacent southern Georgia and Alabama on Saturday.
Additional strong thunderstorms may impact parts of western into
central Montana.

...Synopsis...
An upper cyclone will remain over the Sabine Valley, with cold air
aloft extending from TX toward the northern Gulf Coast. At the
surface, low pressure will move from the northern Gulf into LA/MS,
with a stationary front over southern AL and GA. A moist and
unstable air mass will exist south of this boundary, supporting
bouts of thunderstorms. 

To the west, strong southwest winds aloft will spread across the
Pacific Northwest and into ID and western MT late. Heating within a
surface trough over western MT combined with cooling aloft may
support scattered high based storms.

...FL into far southern GA/AL...
Numerous storms are forecast over parts of the Gulf Of America and
extending from southern AL into the FL Panhandle during the day.
Associated outflows may be strong given the amount of convection.
Veering winds with height in the low levels may support rotation at
times, and a brief tornado cannot be ruled out along the stationary
front.

During the afternoon, strong heating will lead to storms from
central FL into southern GA, and cool temperatures aloft may favor
sporadic hail.

...West-central MT...
Scattered fast-moving storms are forecast after about 21Z along the
ID/MT border and spreading from western into north-central MT. While
high based, steep lapse rates along with favorable mean winds/deep
shear will support both strong to severe gusts and marginal hail.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1143 AM CDT Fri May 09 2025

Valid 091700Z - 101200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

An evolving narrow corridor of isolated showers and thunderstorms
along a cold front will progress through southern Minnesota/northern
Wisconsin through today. Expected PWAT values of 0.8 to 1.0 inch
will support a mix of wet and dry thunderstorm cores through the
afternoon so Isolated Dry Thunderstorm highlights were withheld.
Otherwise, previous forecast (see below) is evolving as expected.

..Williams.. 05/09/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0157 AM CDT Fri May 09 2025/

...Synopsis...
Amplified mid-level flow will continue across the CONUS today as a
broad upper low gradually moves eastward. Western US ridging will
also amplify, forcing stronger flow aloft over the northern US. At
the surface, a cold front will move south across the Northern Plains
and Great Lakes. Relatively mild and wet conditions will prevent
broader fire-weather concerns over much of the country, though a few
drier thunderstorms are possible along the cold front.

...Northern Plains and Great Lakes...
As the cold front progresses southward, isolated thunderstorms are
likely to form along and ahead of it through the heat of the day.
With relatively modest moisture (PWAT values around 0.8 inches)
these storms are expected to be relatively high based. A mixed mode
of wet/occasional dry storms is possible with some lightning risk
over recent dry fuels. While coverage of the drier storms appears
limited, increasingly dry and breezy conditions behind the cold
front could allow for some lightning ignitions and localized
fire-weather concerns.

Valid 091300Z - 101200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE FL PENINSULA AND FAR SOUTHEAST VA/NORTHEAST NC...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms capable of producing large hail and severe wind gusts
are possible across parts of the Southeast, but especially areas
such as the northern Florida Peninsula and eastern North
Carolina/far southeast Virginia.

...Florida/coastal Southeast...
Weak height falls and strengthening southwesterly winds aloft will
occur later today into tonight preceding the upper trough along the
middle Gulf Coast and lower Mississippi River Valley, with an MCS
over the west-central/north-central Gulf also a factor. The
relatively greatest destabilization is expected today across the
northern/central Florida Peninsula and nearby Georgia, where
guidance is in generally good agreement that MLCAPE will peak in the
2000-3000 J/kg range this afternoon. As instability increases during
the day, thunderstorms are expected to develop with sea breeze
influences, with isolated large hail and damaging winds possible.
Elsewhere, influences from the aforementioned MCS over the Gulf
should limited severe potential farther west along the middle Gulf
Coast, although some measure of recovery and weak cyclogenesis could
occur later tonight toward far southeast Louisiana to Florida
Panhandle vicinity.

...Carolinas/southeast Virginia/southern Maryland...
The closed upper low will shift generally eastward over the
central/northern Appalachians and northern Mid-Atlantic region
today, with a cyclonically curved belt of strong westerlies in its
base and attendant mid-level cold pocket (-18C to -24C at 500 mb).
Some showers/possibly a thunderstorm will exit the region and move
into the Atlantic today, with modest air mass
recovery/destabilization in its wake preceding a surface
low/reinforcing front. While the magnitude of the severe risk is not
entirely clear, the main opportunity for later-day strong/locally
severe storm development would appear to be across far southeast
Virginia and far northeast North Carolina. Strong wind profiles
would support organized storms pending sufficient destabilization,
with potential for severe hail and damaging winds, at least on an
isolated basis, primarily from mid-afternoon through sunset or early
evening.

1229 PM CDT Thu May 08 2025

Areas affected...northern Florida...southeastern Georgia...far
southern South Carolina

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 081729Z - 081930Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Hail and damaging wind threat may increase through the
afternoon as thunderstorms develop along the sea breeze.

DISCUSSION...The air mass across southeastern Georgia and southern
South Carolina has warmed and destabilized through the morning and
early afternoon, with temperatures now in the 80s. Thunderstorms
have developed across southern South Carolina along a southward
moving remnant outflow boundary. 

Additional thunderstorm development is expected along the sea breeze
boundary through the afternoon. Deep layer shear will see some
increase to around 30-40 kts through the afternoon, with increasing
westerly flow aloft. A plume of steep lapse rates is in place across
this region, owing to cooling temperature aloft. Largely straight
hodographs and moderate to strong instability will support risk for
large hail and damaging wind with thunderstorm development. This
area will be monitored for possible watch issuance by mid to late
afternoon.

Mesoscale Discussion 0745
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0214 PM CDT Thu May 08 2025

Areas affected...south-central Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 081914Z - 082115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm coverage to increase into the
afternoon/evening with potential for damaging winds and large to
very large hail.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorm activity has been ongoing across the
border in Mexico as well as across portions of far western Texas
this afternoon. The activity in west Texas has been slowly advancing
south and eastward near the Rio Grande. Activity across Mexico has
slowly begun to spread eastward into Texas as well. It is likely
that storms will move out of Mexico across the Rio Grande Valley
into portions of south-central Texas and into the south Texas Brush
Country.

The air mass across this region is very moist and unstable, with
MLCAPE around 1000-2000 J/kg. Deep layer shear around 40-50 kts will
support maintenance of supercells, capable of large to very large
hail (2-2.5 in) and damaging wind through the evening. This area is
being monitored for possible watch issuance this afternoon.

Mesoscale Discussion 0744
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0203 PM CDT Thu May 08 2025

Areas affected...southern Kentucky...middle Tennessee...northeast
Mississippi and northwest Alabama

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 238...239...

Valid 081903Z - 082030Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 238, 239
continues.

SUMMARY...Supercell development/intensification underway. Large hail
and damaging wind gusts remain the primary threat.

DISCUSSION...Several supercells have developed across northern
Tennessee into central Kentucky. These storms have a history of 1 to
1.75 inch hail thus far. The environment downstream of these
supercells continues to destabilize which will maintain the threat
through the afternoon and evening.

Farther south, additional storms have started to develop from
southern Tennessee into northeast Mississippi. Temperatures are not
as cold aloft, but temperatures are warmer (upper 70s to low 80s)
which has sufficiently compensated to support 1500+ J/kg MLCAPE (per
SPC mesoanalysis). Given the stronger deep-layer shear across this
region (~40 knots) beneath the mid-level jet core, expect these
storms to become supercellular with a large hail and damaging wind
threat. These storms may have the greatest threat for isolated 2+
inch hail given the more favorable wind profile. 

Severe thunderstorm watch 238 was expanded into northeast
Mississippi and severe thunderstorm watch 239 was recently issued
across northern Alabama to address this threat farther south.

Mesoscale Discussion 0743
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0137 PM CDT Thu May 08 2025

Areas affected...The western Carolinas and southern Virginia.

Concerning...Severe potential...Severe Thunderstorm Watch likely 

Valid 081837Z - 082000Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Storms developing over the mountains will eventually
become severe with a threat for large hail and damaging wind gusts.

DISCUSSION...Visible satellite shows some deeper convection
developing along/near the crest of the Appalachians. As low-level
moisture continues to advect north and the boundary layer heats up,
instability will increase. This should permit storms to strengthen
further and move off of the terrain. Effective shear around 40 knots
(per SPC mesoanalysis) and 1500 J/kg MLCAPE will support the
potential for organized storms, including supercells. Expect a more
discrete mode with a hail threat initially before storms likely
congeal into one or more clusters with an increasing damaging wind
threat late this afternoon and into the evening. 

A severe thunderstorm watch will likely be needed by mid-afternoon
to address this evolving threat.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 239
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
200 PM CDT Thu May 8 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Northern and Central Alabama
  Southern Middle Tennessee

* Effective this Thursday afternoon and evening from 200 PM until
  1000 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail likely with isolated very large hail events
    to 2 inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms should continue to develop eastward from
northeast Mississippi into parts of northern/central Alabama and
southern middle Tennessee this afternoon and evening. Supercells
will pose a threat for large hail up to 1-2 inches in diameter. Any
clusters that can form may also pose some risk for damaging winds up
to 60-70 mph.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 55
statute miles north and south of a line from 55 miles southwest of
Muscle Shoals AL to 55 miles north northeast of Gadsden AL. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU9).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 238...

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
27030.

Mesoscale Discussion 0741
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1132 AM CDT Thu May 08 2025

Areas affected...Portions of far Western and South-Central Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 081632Z - 081830Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Storms capable of large to very large hail and severe
winds possible through the afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorm activity ongoing near the Trans Pecos and
Davis Mountains is showing an uptick in intensity over the last 30
minutes. Additionally, cumulus development further south across the
Texas Big Bend is noted on visible satellite. Further thunderstorm
development is expected this afternoon as a weak shortwave shifts
eastward and the current activity shifts south and eastward through
time. 

The environment across this region is characterized by MLCAPE around
500-1000 J/kg, steep low to mid-level lapse rates, and deep layer
shear 45-50 kts. Further daytime heating and moist advection will
lead to increase in instability through the afternoon. This regime
will support a mix of supercells and multi-cell clusters capable of
large to very large hail (some 2-2.5 in) and severe wind. There is
some uncertainty on when the most robust convection will develop
beyond the ongoing thunderstorms. This will be monitored for watch
potential this afternoon.

Mesoscale Discussion 0740
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1110 AM CDT Thu May 08 2025

Areas affected...the Mid Mississippi Valley to the Southern
Appalachians

Concerning...Severe potential...Severe Thunderstorm Watch likely 

Valid 081610Z - 081745Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Widespread thunderstorm development is expected this
afternoon with a threat for large hail and damaging wind gusts.

DISCUSSION...Cold temperatures aloft, associated with an eastward
meandering upper low, will provide a focus for widespread
thunderstorm development this afternoon from the Mid Mississippi
Valley to the southern Appalachians. Beneath this cold air aloft,
surface dewpoints are mostly in the mid 60s. This moisture will be
sufficient for moderate instability this afternoon (~1500 J/kg
MLCAPE) as temperatures warm into the mid 70s. A belt of moderate
(40 to 45 knots) of mid-level flow exists south of this upper low
and was apparent on the 12Z RAOB from KBNA and KLZK. This will
provide a sufficiently sheared environment for organized storms
including the potential for some rotating updrafts. This cold air
aloft, yielding moderately steep mid-level lapse rates, and
potential for some supercells will support a threat for large hail,
some of which could be 2+ inches. A remnant EML and dry air aloft,
combined with steep low-level lapse rates will also support a
damaging wind threat. In addition, the expectation for many storms
within the already uncapped airmass should promote storm clustering
which will also increase the damaging wind threat within those
corridors which clustering/bowing segments occur.

The 12Z BNA RAOB showed a convective temperature of 73F which has
nearly been reached as of 16Z. As such, a few storms have already
developed over southeast Missouri and northwest Tennessee where
cooler temperatures aloft are likely supporting a lower convective
temperature. As the boundary layer warms and mid-level temperatures
continue to cool, expect additional strong storm development within
the next 1 to 2 hours. Multiple severe thunderstorm watches will be
needed to address the threat from this development.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0330 PM CDT Wed May 07 2025

Valid 091200Z - 151200Z

Fire weather concerns will remain low in the D3/Wednesday through
D6/Monday period. A broad upper-low will linger across the
southeastern US as heights rise with an upper-level ridge building
in the western US. The building upper-level high in the west will
bring warming and drying conditions, but generally light winds will
keep fire concerns low. 

Late in period D6/Monday into D7/Tuesday, a trough is progged to
develop across the western Pacific. Increased southwesterly flow
aloft will overspread the Great Basin region, bringing likely
overlap of wind/dry conditions ahead of potential for more
precipitation. Less precipitation is expected across portions of
Arizona. Fuels in both of these regions are generally below seasonal
averages for dryness, owing to recent scattered shower and
thunderstorm activity. Though some drying is forecast in ERC
modeling, it is unlikely fuels will be overly receptive for fire
spread, leading to low confidence in including any areas at this
time. Some overlap of windy/dry conditions may extend into portions
of western New Mexico as well. For now, model spread leads to low
confidence in including areas.

Mesoscale Discussion 0723
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0348 PM CDT Tue May 06 2025

Areas affected...Southeast Texas to much of Louisiana.

Concerning...Tornado Watch 234...

Valid 062048Z - 062215Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 234 continues.

SUMMARY...Continued threat for severe wind gusts, tornadoes, and
isolated hail.

DISCUSSION...A well-developed line of storms extends from
east-central Texas to northwest Louisiana. Sporadic wind damage and
at least one tornado has been reported thus far within the line. A
more favorable orientation of the line has occurred across northeast
Texas/northwest Louisiana where a bowing segment is apparent. In
addition, a tornado with a TDS was recently observed southwest of
the SHV radar where a leading supercell interacted with this line.
Limited surface base instability amid mid 60s dewpoints and
preceding rainfall should keep the tornado threat somewhat limited,
but enough surface based or near surface based instability is
present for some tornado threat near the apex of this bow,
particularly where any cell interactions occur. Expect the greatest
severe wind threat near this bowing segment of the line across
northern Louisiana this afternoon and into the early evening.
Farther south, isolated large hail and severe wind gusts are
possible, particularly with any embedded supercells within the line.

A conditional greater tornado threat exists with any supercells
which can develop along/south of the warm front in Louisiana where
STP values are around 2 to 3. STP values may increase this evening
as low-level shear strengthens. Convection strengthening across
southeast Texas could be the beginning of this potential threat. If
any of these supercells can remain discrete with sufficient
longevity to mature, they will pose a strong tornado threat this
afternoon/evening.

Mesoscale Discussion 0722
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0337 PM CDT Tue May 06 2025

Areas affected...portions of eastern Pennsylvania into northwestern
New Jersey and southern New York

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 233...

Valid 062037Z - 062200Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 233
continues.

SUMMARY...Additional instances of damaging gusts and perhaps hail
remain possible with the stronger storms. A tornado may still occur
with storms ahead of a pre-frontal boundary.

DISCUSSION...A primary arching band of strong thunderstorms persists
ahead of a pseudo-dryline pre-frontal boundary across far eastern
PA, with temperatures rising into the upper 70s F amid 10 degree F
dewpoint decreases as the boundary passes. These pre-frontal storms
have been the most organized so far, with multiple instances of
low-level rotation detected and an apparent tornado reported in the
past hour. The best chance for an additional tornado remains with
these storms, along the PA/NJ/NY borders, before the ongoing storms
move into a more stable airmass. Otherwise, strong wind gusts and
perhaps hail may develop with the stronger storms to the west of the
pre-frontal boundary.

Mesoscale Discussion 0721
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0227 PM CDT Tue May 06 2025

Areas affected...much of the Florida Peninsula

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 061927Z - 062200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...A sparse severe threat could develop this afternoon across
the FL Peninsula, where a stray damaging gust or instance of hail
are possible. However, the severe threat should be isolated at best,
precluding a WW issuance.

DISCUSSION...Strong surface heating has aided in thunderstorm
initiation across the FL Peninsula as temperatures have climbed over
90 F. Given at least upper 60s F dewpoints steep low-level lapse
rates, 2000-3000 J/kg MLCAPE are in place south of a remnant frontal
boundary per 19Z mesoanalysis. Synoptic forcing is weak and vertical
wind shear is quite poor, casting doubt on any appreciable severe
threat. However, if a robust thunderstorm manages to develop and
persist, the strong buoyancy in place may support an instance of
hail or strong wind gusts, especially over southern parts of the
Florida Peninsula. Given the very isolated nature of the severe
threat, a WW issuance is not expected.

  Scattered large hail likely with isolated very large hail events
    to 3 inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph likely

SUMMARY...Supercell thunderstorms are expected to develop near a
warm front across the region with other storms related to an
eastward-moving cluster of storms across central Texas early today.
Tornado potential is apparent, including the possibility of strong
tornadoes. Damaging winds and large hail are also expected.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 65 statute miles
north and south of a line from 65 miles north northwest of San
Antonio TX to 35 miles southeast of Huntsville TX. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU1).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for

Mesoscale Discussion 0712
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0611 AM CDT Tue May 06 2025

Areas affected...South-central into east-central TX

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 230...

Valid 061111Z - 061415Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 230
continues.

SUMMARY...An increase in the tornado threat is expected with time
this morning. Tornado Watch issuance is likely later this morning,
though timing is uncertain.

DISCUSSION...Some increase in convection has recently been noted
across parts of the TX Hill Country, in close proximity to a surface
warm front that is expected to lift northward through the morning
across parts of south-central into east-central TX. Favorable
deep-layer shear and low-level SRH (as noted on the KEWX VWP) will
result in supercell potential through the morning, especially as the
warm front moves northward and rich low-level moisture continues to
support moderate to locally strong buoyancy. 

Timing of additional supercell development and maturation within the
warm-advection regime remains somewhat uncertain, as does the
potential influence of an ongoing eastward-moving storm cluster near
San Angelo. However, as the threat for surface-based supercells
increases, a corresponding increase in the tornado threat is
expected with time this morning, in addition to potential for large
hail and locally damaging winds. A Tornado Watch will likely be
needed later this morning, though timing is uncertain.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 230
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
325 AM CDT Tue May 6 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  West-Central and North-Central Texas

* Effective this Tuesday morning from 325 AM until 1000 AM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail likely with isolated very large hail events
    to 2.5 inches in diameter possible
  Isolated damaging wind gusts to 65 mph possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...At least isolated severe storms are expected to expand
east-northeastward across parts of the Low Rolling Plains toward
North-central/central Texas. Large hail will be the primary hazard
overnight, with locally damaging winds also possible. Tornado
potential should increase into central Texas/I-35 vicinity later
this morning.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 70
statute miles north and south of a line from 60 miles north
northwest of San Angelo TX to 55 miles north of Austin TX. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU0).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 229...

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 55 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector

Mesoscale Discussion 0700
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0348 PM CDT Mon May 05 2025

Areas affected...portions of southeastern Texas

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 225...

Valid 052048Z - 052215Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 225
continues.

SUMMARY...The severe threat continues across Severe Thunderstorm
Watch 225. Large hail remains the main concern, but a tornado could
still occur if a supercell can become surface based.

DISCUSSION...Multiple supercell structures have developed across
southeast Texas, and have been progressing eastward on the immediate
cool side of a baroclinic zone. These supercells are likely still
elevated, and given adequate buoyancy above 700 mb (per RAP forecast
soundings), severe hail could still occur given elongated mid to
upper-level hodographs and corresponding 50+ kts of effective bulk
shear. Closer to the Gulf Coast, multiple thunderstorms continue to
intensify within a WAA regime. These storms are associated with a
relatively more unstable, surface-based airmass. Regional VADs on
the warm side of the baroclinic boundary show low-level hodographs
with modest size and curvature, with around 300 m2/s2 SRH present
(per 19Z mesoanalysis). It is unclear if these storms can organize
and intensify into mature surface-based supercells before reaching
the cool side of the baroclinic boundary. If they do though, a
tornado remains possible.

0311 PM CDT Mon May 05 2025

Areas affected...east-central and southeast FL

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 224...

Valid 052011Z - 052215Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 224
continues.

SUMMARY...Potential for isolated large hail and localized severe
gusts should persist through early to mid evening across southeast
and east-central Florida.

DISCUSSION...Several cells across southeast FL have somewhat
weakened after earlier producing large hail reported up to ping-pong
ball size. This activity may still produce marginal hail/wind as
storms oscillate in the near-term. Large-scale convective outflow
has surged south and west, potentially serving as a focus for storm
development in the interior peninsula into early evening. 

Farther north, the Melbourne VWP has consistently sampled around
40-45 kt 0-6 km shear. Although thunderstorm development has been
subdued to an extent, additional storms may yet form along the
Atlantic sea breeze to the quasi-stationary front. Ample buoyancy
will favor isolated large hail and localized severe gusts.

Areas affected...eastern NC and southeast VA

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 223...

Valid 051910Z - 052115Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 223
continues.

SUMMARY...A mixed severe hail/damaging wind threat should persist
across eastern North Carolina and advance/shift north-northeast
across southeast Virginia through early evening.

DISCUSSION...Numerous cells have been prevalent, especially across
central into eastern NC this afternoon. Here, a south-southwesterly
deep-layer wind profile, per area VWPs, along with transient
supercell structures has resulted in convection largely progressing
northeastward thus far. But activity should pivot to a greater
northerly component given the evolution of the upstream vort
max/attendant mid-level jetlet. Air mass appears to be modestly
unstable downstream across southeast VA with MLCAPE of 1000-1500
J/kg. This should help sustain a severe hail/damaging wind threat
through early evening. Despite numerous cells and hail reports, peak
severe magnitude has only reached 1 inch thus far.

Mesoscale Discussion 0684
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0338 PM CDT Sun May 04 2025

Areas affected...southeast NM and far west TX

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 222...

Valid 042038Z - 042215Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 222
continues.

SUMMARY...Supercells are expected to intensify across southeast New
Mexico into parts of far west Texas through early evening. Hail is
the primary hazard, likely reaching golf to tennis ball size.
Isolated severe gusts to 70 mph and a brief tornado are possible.

DISCUSSION...Overall forecast remains as advertised. Storm
intensification has been gradual, but largely focused near the
Sacramento Mountains in Otero and Lincoln counties, and separately
over Eddy and Chaves, spreading into Lea within NM. These cells and
others that should develop off the higher terrain of the northern
Trans-Pecos in TX will likely intensify during the next few hours. A
ribbon of surface dew points near 50 F have held along the Pecos
Valley, supporting a confined corridor of moderate buoyancy. With
onset of strengthening low-level flow around 22Z, supercell
coverage/intensity should peak into early evening. Thereafter, drier
low-level air over the TX South Plains and eastern Permian Basin
should result in increased ingest of MLCIN deeper into the evening.

east, now completely out of SC and over eastern NC. Earlier, a 50 kt
gust was measured near North Myrtle Beach. 

In addition to the narrow north-south line of convection, other
storms have developed ahead of the line. These storms have shown
periodic weak mesocyclones. Other storms continue to show
near-severe inbound velocities mainly over the water, but this
activity may eventually move inland.

The air mass is marginally unstable, but sufficient for isolated
severe reports this morning. Low-level SRH with 0-1 km values of
100-150 m2/s2 will continue to favor rotation within the stronger
storms, though any tornado risk should remain low-end in nature.

Mesoscale Discussion 0670
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0306 PM CDT Sat May 03 2025

Areas affected...the Trans-Pecos in southwest Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 032006Z - 032230Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...An isolated supercell or two, capable of large hail, may
develop this afternoon. If storms form and intensify, the severe
threat should still be isolated, so a WW issuance is not expected.

DISCUSSION...Convection continues to deepen across the Trans-Pecos
region in southwest TX as warming surface temperatures beneath 7
C/km mid-level lapse rates contributes to 500+ J/kg MLCAPE. Despite
mid-level ridging, the overspreading of a 60-80 kt 300 mb jet stream
is resulting in 40+ kts of 0-6 km speed shear (per latest RAP
forecast soundings and mesoanalysis). This vertical shear profile,
along with the aforementioned buoyancy, is adequate in supporting
supercell storm modes capable of producing large hail with any
updrafts that can mature and sustain themselves. Given modest
instability and ascent, storm development should remain quite
isolated, along with any severe threat that manages to materialize.
Given the anticipated isolated severe threat, a WW issuance is
unlikely.
