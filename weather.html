Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1055 AM CST Mon Feb 05 2024

Valid 061200Z - 071200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected on Tuesday.

...Synopsis...
An amplified upper-level pattern will persist on Tuesday, as a deep
trough in the West, ridge over the central states, and a deep trough
over the East all move gradually eastward through the day.
Relatively low-topped convection with sporadic lightning flashes
will be possible across parts of the Southwest and southern CA.
While a strong storm or two cannot be ruled out from the lower CO
River Valley into western AZ, weak instability should generally
limit the organized severe-thunderstorm threat. 

Isolated thunderstorms will also be possible near and offshore of
the Florida Atlantic coast, as convection moves south-southwestward
along the western periphery of a deep cyclone centered northeast of
the Bahamas.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1024 AM CST Mon Feb 05 2024

Valid 051630Z - 061200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe weather threat has diminished across Florida, with additional
risk not expected there, or over the remainder of the country.

...Discussion...
A positively tilted upper trough -- extending from near the Pacific
Northwest Coast southwestward across the eastern Pacific -- will
make gradual eastward progress today.  Upstream, ridging will
prevail over the central CONUS.  Still further upstream, two upper
lows will continue to affect the eastern U.S. through the period. 
The first -- lingering over the northwestern Atlantic southeast of
the Canadian Maritimes -- will result in persistence of cyclonic
northwesterly flow aloft across New England.  The second low of
interest is one that has drifted south into the northeastern Gulf of
Mexico.  This low is forecast to take a southeastward and then
eastward turn with time, shifting into Florida late today, and then
across the Peninsula tonight.

At the surface, low pressure over the eastern Gulf is forecast to
redevelop off eastern coast of Florida near the Bahamas by this
evening.  Currently, vigorous convection that was affecting the Keys
and southern portions of the Peninsula has shifted east, with
northerly low-level winds now over southern Florida in the wake of
this convection and the associated outflow boundary.

While weak instability lingers off the western Florida coast at this
time, dewpoints are now in the 50s inland, and thus an accordingly
stable airmass is indicated.  As such, potential for any stronger
convection inland has diminished substantially, and will gradually
end entirely as the surface low redevelops off the eastern coast. 
As such, the MRGL risk is being removed at this time, with severe
storms not expected across Florida, or the rest of the U.S., for the
remainder of the period.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0951 AM CST Mon Feb 05 2024

Valid 051700Z - 061200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast remains valid with no changes. Fire-weather
concerns are low. See the prior discussion.

..Lyons.. 02/05/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1151 PM CST Sun Feb 04 2024/

...Synopsis...
An upper ridge will build over the Plains states today between a
mid-level trough ejecting into the Atlantic and a second trough
impinging on the West Coast. Relatively cool temperatures with weak
wind fields should characterize surface conditions across the
Plains, with heavier precipitation falling along the West Coast and
Gulf Coast areas, limiting significant wildfire-spread potential
across much of the CONUS.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE FLORIDA
KEYS AND A SMALL PART OF SOUTH FLORIDA...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms are expected over parts of south
Florida and the Keys today, with a marginal tornado, damaging-gust
and large-hail threat.

...Synopsis...
The synoptic pattern in mid/upper levels will remain highly
amplified through the period, but will become more progressive
again.  A fairly well-stacked, cold-core cyclone now over the
southeastern AL/FL Panhandle region is expected to pivot
southeastward over the northeastern Gulf to central FL through 00Z,
then eastward over the Atlantic tonight.  This will occur as an
upstream closed 500-mb high over the upper Mississippi Valley
weakens and transitions into the northeastern part of a larger-
scale, open-wave ridge.

Meanwhile, a north/south-elongated cyclone now near the central/
northern Pacific Coast will drift eastward and become an open-wave
trough.  In the preceding southwesterly to southerly flow aloft,
numerous small vorticity lobes and shortwaves will eject across the
West Coast States, northern Rockies, Intermountain region, and Great
Basin.  By 12Z tomorrow, the main trough should extend over the
Cascades, southward over the SFO area and Pacific, well offshore
from Baja.

At the surface, 11Z analysis showed a low near AAF, with cold front
arching southeastward then southward over the northeastern/extreme
east-central Gulf.  The low should track southeastward across the
northeastern Gulf, then eastward over south-central FL through 00Z,
with the front to its southeast.  An outflow boundary from earlier
convection was evident over the Upper Keys, and may shift northward
into southernmost portions of the mainland before being overtaken by
the front and/or prefrontal convection.

...South FL and Keys...
In the westerlies aloft, south of the stacked cyclone, a weak
shortwave trough was evident in moisture-channel imagery over the
extreme eastern Gulf, approaching south FL and the Keys.  The
feature has been preceded by a band of thunderstorms with an
embedded supercell.  The related plume of large-scale ascent will
shift eastward across the outlook area through midafternoon,
supporting both the eastward shift of existing convection across the
area, and the development of additional thunderstorms from Atlantic
coastal areas of south FL southwestward across the Keys and
adjoining waters.

Deep shear and long low-level hodographs will persist across the
region, beneath tight midlevel height gradient related to the
cyclone.  Some progs suggest localized backing of near-surface winds
along coastal/convective boundaries -- such as apparent now over
parts of the upper Keys and Miami-Dade County north of the outflow
boundary -- can persist into a period of low-level destabilization
related to both muted diabatic heating and warm advection.  The
thermodynamic environment -- initially hostile for surface-based
parcels over mainland areas per 12Z MFL RAOB, but somewhat more
favorably modified in the Keys as sampled by the KEY sounding --
also should improve through cooling aloft and steepening of midlevel
lapse rates.  Accordingly modified forecast soundings yield MLCAPE
peaking in the 500-800 J/kg range over the Keys, and around 300-500
J/kg over the southeasternmost mainland.  While climatologically
small for severe over FL, this buoyancy (given the favorable wind
profiles and cold air aloft) will support a threat for relatively
low-topped supercells and small bows, accompanied by hail and gusts
near severe limits, and the possibility of a tornado where
storm-scale/boundary processes can augment low-level shear locally.
