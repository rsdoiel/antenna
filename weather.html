Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0702 AM CDT Wed Jun 12 2024

Valid 121300Z - 131200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON
AND EVENING ACROSS PORTIONS OF NORTHEAST MINNESOTA AND NORTHWEST
WISCONSIN...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms capable of very large hail, damaging
wind gusts, and a few tornadoes will be possible across parts of the
Upper Midwest late afternoon and early evening.

...Southern MN/WI early today...
Morning water vapor imagery shows a fast-moving shortwave trough
over the western Dakotas.  Lift and enhanced low-level
thermal/moisture advection ahead of the trough has resulted in
scattered thunderstorm development over western MN and eastern SD. 
These storms may persist through the morning, tracking across
central/southern MN by early afternoon with some risk of large hail.
 Daytime heating and increasing low-level moisture will eventually
result in moderate CAPE and a risk of organized strong/severe
thunderstorms - mainly from central MN eastward after 18z.  These
storms may grow upscale and track into central WI before weakening,
posing a continued risk of damaging winds and hail.

...Northern MN/WI later today...
In the wake of the aforementioned morning convection, strong daytime
heating and moisture advection will result in a corridor of moderate
CAPE across central/northeast MN by mid/late afternoon. 
Temperatures west of this area will heating to near 90F, with
forecast soundings showing little cap, very steep mid-level lapse
rates, and MLCAPE values around 3000 J/kg.  Large scale forcing will
be subtle, leading to the development of discrete supercells. 
Several overnight CAM runs suggest intense storms that form will
track into the Arrowhead region of MN and areas around Duluth by
early evening, posing a risk of very large hail, damaging winds, and
a few tornadoes.  Forecast soundings show substantial low-level
shear with effective SRH values of 300+ m2/s2.  It is uncertain how
the early storms over southern MN will affect moisture return.  If
high dewpoint air can make it into the ENH risk area, higher tornado
probabilities may become warranted.  These storms will likely
congeal and spread eastward across northern WI during the evening
with a continued risk of damaging winds and some hail.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0400 AM CDT Wed Jun 12 2024

...DISCUSSION...
...Saturday/Day 4 to Saturday/Day 5...
On Saturday, an upper-level trough is forecast to move northeastward
across the southern and central High Plains. An axis of instability
is forecast to be further to the northwest across the western
Dakotas. As a mid-level jet passes northeastward across the northern
Rockies, large-scale ascent and deep-layer shear should be strong
enough for an isolated severe thunderstorms in parts of the northern
High Plains. Large hail and severe wind gusts will be possible, but
uncertainty exists concerning the spatial distribution of the
threat.

The trough in the central Plains is forecast to move into the upper
Mississippi Valley on Sunday, with a large pocket of instability
located in its wake across the central Plains. Although large-scale
ascent within this unstable airmass is expected to be weak, isolated
severe storms could develop in the late afternoon and early evening.


Further to the northwest, model forecasts show potential for storm
development in parts of the northern High Plains Sunday evening. If
this were to occur, MCS development, and an isolated severe threat,
could occur across parts of the northern Plains Sunday night.

...Monday/Day 6 to Wednesday/Day 8...
On Monday, a mid-level jet is forecast to move northeastward into
the northern Plains, as a moist and unstable airmass remains in
place across the Upper Midwest. Severe thunderstorms may develop
across parts of the region during the afternoon and evening, in
association with any shortwave trough that can translate through the
flow. The models suggest there is enough potential on Monday for a
more widespread severe threat, to add a 15 percent contour in parts
of the eastern Dakotas and Minnesota.

On Tuesday, an upper-level trough is forecast to move across the
northern Plains. Isolated strong to severe thunderstorms would be
possible ahead of the trough in parts of the upper Mississippi
Valley. As the trough moves through southeastern Canada on
Wednesday, severe storms would be possible in parts of the
Northeast. However, uncertainty is considerable at this range in the
forecast period.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1056 AM CDT Mon Jun 10 2024

Valid 101700Z - 111200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast remains on track. Please see the discussion
below for additional meteorological details. In addition, breezy
northwest winds around 15-25 mph will develop this afternoon in and
around the Sacramento and San Andres Mountains of NM via a localized
tight pressure gradient. However, cooler temperatures will only
yield minimum RH of 25-35 percent within these regions, precluding
the need for an Elevated area.

..Barnes.. 06/10/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0142 AM CDT Mon Jun 10 2024/

...Synopsis...
A weak midlevel ridge will favor continued warm/dry conditions
across much of the Southwest, where fuels continue to dry. While
these warm/dry conditions will support locally elevated fire-weather
conditions, a weak pressure gradient should limit sustained surface
winds and the overall fire-weather threat.

Farther north, moderate midlevel westerly flow on the backside of a
shortwave trough will cross the northern Cascades. As a result,
locally dry/breezy conditions are possible within the Cascade gaps
over central WA and northern OR -- potentially yielding locally
elevated fire-weather conditions.
