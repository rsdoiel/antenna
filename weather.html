Mesoscale Discussion 0015
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0940 AM CST Mon Jan 08 2024

Areas affected...East Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 081540Z - 081745Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered elevated thunderstorms over east Texas may begin
to pose a risk of hail in the strongest cores.  Watch issuance seems
unlikely at this time, but trends are being monitored.

DISCUSSION...Recent radar/satellite loops show scattered showers and
thunderstorms slowly intensifying over parts of east TX.  This
activity is along the core of a strong southerly low-level jet, and
north of a surface warm front.  Parcels near the surface remain
stable.  But forecast soundings in this area show steep mid-level
lapse rates and weak-but-sufficient elevated CAPE for the risk of a
few robust updrafts.  Low-level/deep-layer shear is quite strong,
which would support at least transient supercell structures as well.
 So far, trends of this activity have remained below severe limits,
and model guidance suggests it may still be several hours before a
more focused severe threat develops.  Nevertheless, trends will be
closely monitored for an increasing risk.

Mesoscale Discussion 0014
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0927 AM CST Mon Jan 08 2024

Areas affected...Northeast Kansas into southeast Nebraska

Concerning...Heavy snow 

Valid 081527Z - 081830Z

SUMMARY...Rain will transition to heavy snow across northeast Kansas
and vicinity late this morning into the afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Several observation sites across northeast Kansas have
switched from rain to snow in the last hour as the column cools from
increasing isentropic ascent across the region. Expect this to
continue for the remaining areas across northeast Kansas where rain
is still falling. This strong ascent will also lead to very heavy
snowfall rates in excess of 1 inch per hour. In addition, the
heavier snowfall rates will lift into southeast Nebraska by midday
with some snowfall rates approaching 2 inches per hour amid a deeper
DGZ and colder surface temperatures. Winds will increase to around
15 mph with gusts to 25 mph this afternoon which will lead to an
increase in blowing and drifting across the region.

Mesoscale Discussion 0013
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0739 AM CST Mon Jan 08 2024

Areas affected...northwest KS...south-central NE

Concerning...Heavy snow 

Valid 081339Z - 081745Z

SUMMARY...Heavy snowfall rates around 1 to 1.5 inches per hour are
possible through the morning.

DISCUSSION...A mesoscale band of heavier snowfall rates appears to
be developing across northwest KS on the northern periphery of a
warm conveyor belt located over the southern-central Great Plains. 
Frontogenetic forcing for ascent is forecast to continue to
strengthen during the morning across western KS and eventually into
southern NE by late morning.  The 12 UTC Dodge City raob showed a
moist profile and an above-freezing layer from the surface through
800 mb.  A surface front is draped southwest to northeast from far
southwestern KS north-northeast into northwest KS (i.e., located to
the northwest of Dodge City).  The colder airmass north of the front
will support snow as the precipitation type.  Model guidance
indicates upwards of 0.10 to 0.15 inches per hour liquid-equivalent
precipitation across northwest KS this morning.  As a result of
nearly 10:1 snow ratios, expecting 1 to 1.5 inches per hour (locally
heavier bursts are possible) as lift continues to strengthen during
the morning.

Mesoscale Discussion 0011
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0527 AM CST Mon Jan 08 2024

Areas affected...Southeast CO...Raton Mesa of northeast NM...far
western KS

Concerning...Blizzard 

Valid 081127Z - 081730Z

SUMMARY...Heavy snowfall rates around 1 inch per hour are expected
to begin between 13-15 UTC on a localized basis.  Surface gusts will
rapidly increase this morning (into the 35-60 mph range) and
coincide with more widespread 1 inch per hour snowfall rates.  These
conditions will lead to substantially reduced visibilities and
result in blizzard conditions beginning during the late morning
(15-18 UTC).

DISCUSSION...Water-vapor imagery shows a powerful mid-level
shortwave trough moving east across the Sangre de Cristos early this
morning.  Deep-layer forcing for ascent will continue to overspread
the central High Plains as the column saturates early this morning. 
Light to moderate snow will transition to localized heavy snow
(i.e., rates around 1 inch per hour) beginning in the 13-15 UTC
period according to the latest SREF and HREF model guidance.  Heavy
snowfall rates of around 1 inch per hour will become widespread
during the 15-18 UTC period as both upslope flow strengthens south
of the Arkansas River and deep-layer ascent associated with the
cyclone intensifies.

Low-level flow is forecast to intensify markedly during the morning
with 250 m AGL flow increasing from less than 10 kt to 50 kt while
contributing to very strong gusts and substantially reduced
visibilities.  The strengthening of surface gusts into the 35-60 mph
range is expected to coincide with the onset of more widespread 1
inch per hour snowfall rates and result in blizzard conditions
during the 15-18 UTC period.

PUBLIC SEVERE WEATHER OUTLOOK  
NWS STORM PREDICTION CENTER NORMAN OK
0734 AM CST MON JAN 08 2024

...Severe thunderstorms expected over parts of the Gulf Coast later
today and tonight...

* LOCATIONS...
  Southern Louisiana
  Southern Mississippi
  Southeast Texas
  Southern Alabama
  Florida Panhandle

* HAZARDS...
  A few intense tornadoes
  Scattered damaging winds, some hurricane force
  Isolated large hail

* SUMMARY...
  Severe thunderstorms capable of strong wind gusts and tornadoes
  are expected across the Gulf Coast States this afternoon through
  early Tuesday morning. This includes the possibility of strong
  tornadoes and a significant nighttime severe weather risk for
  southeast Louisiana and southern Mississippi into southern
  Alabama and the western Florida Panhandle.

Preparedness actions...

Tornadoes at night can be particularly dangerous because they 
are usually fast-moving and difficult to see. Stay tuned to
NOAA Weather Radio, weather.gov, or other media for watches and
warnings. A tornado watch means that conditions are favorable
for tornadoes to form during the next several hours. If a tornado
warning is issued for your area, move to a place of safety,
ideally in a basement or interior room on the lowest floor of a
sturdy building.

0707 AM CST Mon Jan 08 2024

Valid 081300Z - 091200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE GULF
COAST STATES...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms capable of strong wind gusts and tornadoes are
expected across the Gulf Coast States this afternoon through early
Tuesday morning, spanning southeast Texas and southern Louisiana
across southern Mississippi, southern Alabama to the western Florida
Panhandle.

...Northern Texas/ArkLaTex Today...
Thunderstorms erupted overnight within the warm conveyor extending
across north Texas into Oklahoma/Kansas, which includes some
well-organized linear structures across western north Texas/Big
Country in the predawn hours. These more organized storms are
elevated and occurring parallel to robustly strengthening deep-layer
southwesterly winds. Severe hail potential will tend to be mitigated
by a more linear convective mode, while severe-caliber wind gust
potential, particularly with northward regional extent, will tend to
be limited by the coolness/stability of the boundary layer.
Regardless, some stronger thunderstorm wind gusts could occur
through the afternoon. For additional short-term details, see
Mesoscale Discussion 12.

...East/southeast Texas to southwest Louisiana through Evening...
Secondary surface low development is expected across east Texas
through the afternoon with an evolving surface triple point across
east-central Texas, all while mid/upper 60s F surface dewpoints
become increasingly common across southeast Texas/southwest
Louisiana. Widespread cloud cover and scattered warm advection
showers will initially limit solar heating, but inhibition should
weaken through the afternoon as deep-layer ascent increases and
gradual warming of the boundary layer supports 1200-2000 J/kg
MLCAPE. Scattered thunderstorms should gradually evolve/deepen as
forcing for ascent increases this afternoon, coincident with strong
low-level and deep-layer shear profiles sufficient for supercells
and an increasing tornado/damaging wind risk. A few semi-discrete
storms/supercells may develop ahead of more linearly organized
storms evolving near the cold front during the afternoon and
evening. A strong tornado could occur given the magnitude of the
low-level shear/SRH.

...Middle Gulf Coast tonight through early Tuesday...
A particularly active severe-weather scenario is expected tonight
through early Tuesday across the region, spanning areas from
southeast Louisiana, southern Mississippi, southern Alabama to the
western Florida Panhandle. This may include multiple rounds of
fast-moving severe storms, with concerns for nocturnal strong
tornadoes and wind damage through the overnight hours as extremely
strong low/mid-level winds influence the region in tandem with an
inland developing warm/moist sector.

Scattered elevated showers and thunderstorms should develop/increase
and expand northeastward across today to the north of a warm front
as the warm conveyor gradually refocuses eastward across the region.
Some guidance suggests this convection could be fairly extensive,
which will probably hinder the northward extent of richer maritime
air later today/tonight, tending to focus the highest probability
severe risks in coastal areas (generally within 75 miles from the
Gulf of Mexico). 

Aided by a surface wave across the ArkLaMiss and eventually into
Alabama, in the wake of the aforementioned elevated storms earlier
in the day, an influx of higher theta-e will move inland tonight
with an increasing potential for surface-based storms across the
aforementioned coastal regions. Semi-discrete supercells capable of
tornado potential may first increase tonight near the
inland-advancing warm front, which will precede (to the east of)
increasingly organized linear convection near the cold front/surface
wave across Louisiana/Mississippi.

This will be a time when deep-layer/low-level winds are dramatically
strengthening, accentuated by a 70+ kt low-level jet. Some portions
of the region, especially parts of southeast Louisiana and far
southern Mississippi, may experience multiple rounds of severe
storms that have a tornado risk. Regardless, a consequential
damaging wind/tornado risk will regionally increase nocturnally,
including the potential for strong (EF2+) tornadoes, in multiple
regimes potentially including some semi-discrete near-coastal
supercells as well as the more prevalent evolving quasi-linear
convection that is likely to reach southern Alabama and the Florida
Panhandle by the predawn hours (roughly 09Z-12Z).

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1238 PM CST Sun Jan 07 2024

Valid 081200Z - 091200Z

No changes to the ongoing forecast. Dry and windy conditions are
probable across parts of South Texas during the late afternoon and
persisting into the evening. Poor fuel receptiveness and strong cold
air advection behind the cold front should limit the overall fire
weather concerns, however.

..Wendt.. 01/07/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0205 AM CST Sun Jan 07 2024/

...Synopsis...
An intense upper-level trough and surface low are forecast to
amplify further as they move eastward across the south-central CONUS
D2/Monday. In the wake of the low, a strong cold front will move
eastward ushering in a windy, but much colder air mass. A few hours
of dry and windy conditions are possible over parts of West TX.

...West TX...
As the upper trough and surface low continue to intensify over the
Southern Plains, low-level winds are expected to increase across the
TX Trans Pecos region through much of D2/Monday. Strong pressure
gradients behind the low will aid downslope gusts of 25-35 mph.
Coincident with the increasing winds, a dry low-level air mass with
RH values below 25% is possible. A few hours of elevated
meteorological conditions may develop in the afternoon. With strong
winds and areas of low humidity potentially overlapping ahead of the
cooler air mass, elevated fire-weather conditions are a possibility,
for a few hours, despite modest fuel availability.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1116 AM CST Sun Jan 07 2024

Areas affected...Portions of Southern New England

Concerning...Heavy snow 

Valid 071716Z - 072015Z

SUMMARY...Moderate to heavy snow expected through the afternoon with
rain transitioning to snow near the coast.

DISCUSSION...Snow is intensifying across portions of southern New
England as the surface low intensifies over the Atlantic and
low-level wind fields strengthen. Snowfall rates of 1 to perhaps 2
inches per hour are expected through the afternoon before moving
offshore by this evening. Areas near the coast which have been
mostly rain thus far due to winds off the ocean will transition to
snow in the next few hours as winds shift more northerly as the
cyclone deepens/moves east. In addition, sustained winds around 15
mph with gusts of 25 to 30 mph may lead to some blowing and drifting
snow and additional visibility restrictions through the afternoon.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1136 AM CST Sun Jan 07 2024

Valid 081200Z - 091200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
CENTRAL GULF COAST OVERNIGHT MONDAY INTO EARLY TUESDAY...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms capable of strong wind gusts and tornadoes are
expected from southeast Texas across the central Gulf Coast and from
Monday afternoon into early Tuesday morning. Greatest severe
potential is anticipated overnight from southeast Louisiana across
southern Mississippi and southern Alabama, and into the western
Florida Panhandle.

...Synopsis...
Shortwave trough currently extending from Great Basin through the
northern Baja Peninsula is forecast to move eastward today while
intensifying. By 12Z Monday morning this shortwave will likely have
matured into a mid-latitude cyclone centered over northeast NM, with
an extensive belt of strong mid-level flow throughout its southern
periphery. This cyclone is then expected to evolve eastward across
the TX Panhandle and OK throughout the day, with mid-level flow
strengthening considerably throughout its eastern periphery. By
Monday evening, 100+ kt at 500-mb will likely stretch from the
Edwards Plateau into the Ozark Plateau. Further strengthening of
this mid-level flow is anticipated overnight Monday as the cyclone
tracks a bit more northeastward, ending the period over western MO.
Intense low-level flow will accompany this cyclone as well, with a
large area of 50+ kt over the southern Plains early Monday. This
low-level jet will shift eastward throughout the day and overnight,
while gradually strengthening. By early Tuesday morning, 60+ kt
850-mb flow will cover much of the Southeast, with 70+ kt possible
from northern MS into middle TN and northern AL. 

Previous frontal intrusion (evidenced by the cold and dry conditions
over the southern Plains and Southeast Sunday) will limit the
northern extent of the moisture return and associated
severe-thunderstorm potential. General expectation is for secondary
surface cyclogenesis over central TX Monday morning, with the
primary low well to the north over the TX/OK Panhandles. This
secondary low (and associated warm front) should delineate the
northern extent of the severe potential as it gradually moves
eastward across central portions of east TX and into central LA
Monday afternoon and evening. This low is forecast to continue
eastward overnight Monday into early Tuesday, progressing across
central MS and AL. Severe thunderstorms are expected within the warm
sector ahead of this low, as well as along the associated cold front
as it surges eastward.

...North TX Early Monday...
As the strong mid-level flow associated with the cyclone moves into
southern Plains, a fast-moving line of showers and embedded
thunderstorms is expected to move across north TX early Monday
morning. Forecast soundings show very weak thermodynamics, limiting
overall updraft strength and duration. However, given the strong low
and upper level support, a narrow-line of forced convection may
become capable of locally gusty/damaging wind gusts as it moves
eastward.

...TX Coastal Plain/Southeast TX into southwest LA Monday Afternoon
and Evening...
Two rounds of strong to severe thunderstorms are possible across the
region Monday, with the first round likely beginning early Monday
afternoon as the warm sector moves into the region. Current guidance
suggests this warm sector will be characterized by temperatures in
the low 70s, dewpoints in the upper 60s, and moderate buoyancy.
However, given the prevalence of cloud cover and early period
showers, there is uncertainty regarding if temperatures can reach
the low 70s. If they do, some surface-based supercells capable of
all severe hazards, including tornadoes are possible. If
temperatures stay in the 60s, low-level stability would likely
inhibit surface-based storm development, mitigating the severe
potential. Consensus within the guidance has trended towards warmer
temperatures and tornado probabilities were increased across the
region as a result. A further increase in probabilities may be
needed in later outlooks if confidence in surface-based storms
increases.

Additional thunderstorm development is anticipated along the front
as it moves through, but the strength of these storms will be
predicated on coverage and strength of any warm sector development.
Strong wind gusts would be the primary severe risk with this
convective line.  

...Central Gulf Coast Overnight Monday into Tuesday Morning...
As the surface low continues eastward, a convective line is expected
to mature along the cold front as it encounters a moderately moist
and buoyant airmass and increasingly strong low-level flow. As the
line matures, it will likely transition from a more parallel
stratiform structure to a more organized leading-line, trailing
stratiform configuration. Robust low-level kinematics, characterized
by 50-60 kt just above the surface and 500+ m2/s2 of 0-3 km SRH,
suggest both significant-severe gusts and strong QLCS tornadoes are
possible.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1033 AM CST Sun Jan 07 2024

Valid 071700Z - 081200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No changes to the ongoing forecast.

..Wendt.. 01/07/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0159 AM CST Sun Jan 07 2024/

...Synopsis...
An amplified and progressive mid-level flow pattern will persist
over the CONUS as a Pacific trough is forecast to rapidly deepen
over parts of the western US before ejecting eastward over the
southern Plains. In response, a strong lee low will develop,
supporting gusty winds across parts of West TX. However, cool
temperatures and widespread recent precipitation should limit
fire-weather concerns.

...Texas Trans Pecos...
As the upper trough and surface low move across the southern Plains,
strong southerly winds and pockets of lower humidity are possible
over parts of West TX and southern NM. Gusts of 25-35 mph and RH
values below 20% are possible over a minima in recent precipitation.
Elevated to critical meteorological conditions are possible in parts
of southern New Mexico into the Trans-Pecos. However, unreceptive
fuels are not expected to support widespread concerns.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1015 AM CST Sun Jan 07 2024

Valid 071630Z - 081200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS LATE TONIGHT
OVER PORTIONS OF WESTERN NORTH TEXAS AND SOUTHWEST OKLAHOMA...

...SUMMARY...
A few strong storms capable of gusty/damaging winds are possible
late tonight over portions of western north Texas and southwest
Oklahoma.

...TX/OK...
A vigorous shortwave trough currently over southern NV will
amplify/deepen tonight as it digs into the southern Rockies. 
Meanwhile, an intense southerly low-level jet will develop ahead of
the system over TX, resulting in enhanced low-level warm advection
and lift - along with weak destabilization.  The result will likely
be the development of a line of fast-moving showers and
thunderstorms after midnight over parts of west TX and southwest OK.
 Forecast soundings show very weak thermodynamics, suggesting the
updraft strength will be modest.  However, given the strong low and
upper level support, a narrow-line of forced convection may become
capable of locally gusty/damaging wind gusts (mainly 09-12z).
