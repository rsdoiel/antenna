Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1118 AM CST Sun Dec 24 2023

Valid 251200Z - 261200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected on Monday.

...Southeast...
While no severe area is currently highlighted, conditional brief
tornado/localized damaging wind potential may become apparent from
the FL Panhandle/southeast AL to the GA/SC border area on Monday.

A gradually weakening shortwave impulse will move northeast from the
Lower MS Valley to the OH Valley, pivoting around a deepening
mid/upper low over the central Great Plains. Primary surface cyclone
will occlude across parts of the Lower to Mid-MO Valley via a
northwest arc through IA. A minor, southern-stream surface wave near
the AL/FL Panhandle coast at 12Z Monday should decay with
convergence along the cold front waning through the day. The
trailing portion of an initially strong low-level jet within the
warm conveyor will likewise pivot northeast from AL/western GA/FL
Panhandle across the TN Valley and southern Appalachians. 

Potential for surface-based destabilization within the warm conveyor
should be quite limited inland of the Gulf Coast, with widespread
cloudiness and ongoing showers/thunderstorms amid initially poor low
to mid-level lapse rates. Meager destabilization should occur during
the day between the weakening cold front and the pivoting warm
conveyor as the mid-level dry slot overspreads in the wake of the
departing shortwave impulse, but this will be accompanied by
substantial diminishing of low-level shear. While the most likely
scenario is for a nil severe threat, favorable low-level hodographs
within the warm conveyor suggests that potential may not be
negligible if this can overlap adequate surface-based instability.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1055 AM CST Sun Dec 24 2023

Valid 251200Z - 261200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The forecast remains on track. For details, see the previous
discussion below.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0139 AM CST Sun Dec 24 2023/

...Synopsis...
On Tuesday, a surface low will occlude in the central/northern
Plains and shift into the Upper Midwest. This will bring some breezy
conditions from the Great Lakes to the Midwest and northern Plains.
However, much of this area will either be moist with recent wetting
rainfall or too cold to support significant fire spread. Elsewhere,
fire-weather concerns will also remain minimal with a strong Arctic
high in the Intermountain West and mostly wet fuels across the
CONUS.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0137 AM CST Sun Dec 24 2023/

...Synopsis...
A upper-level trough will amplify today and eventually develop into
a closed low across the central Plains by Monday morning. During
this period, a surface low will slowly strengthen as it shifts east
along a front in the central/southern Plains. A strengthening
pressure gradient will result in breezy conditions across much of
the central CONUS. However, wetting rain has occurred or will occur
during the day today across most of the region where the strongest
winds are expected. Therefore, fire-weather concerns will be
minimal.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1021 AM CST Sun Dec 24 2023

Valid 241630Z - 251200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not forecast through tonight across the
contiguous United States.

...East TX/LA...
A negatively tilted upper trough is moving across the Southern
Plains into the Gulf Coast region during this forecast period. 
Scattered showers and thunderstorms will occur ahead of the trough,
from TX into AL and the FL panhandle.  Surface trajectories will
limit the influx of Gulf moisture northward/inland today, making
surface-based thunderstorm development unlikely.

A strong storm or two might occur from the upper TX gulf coast to
coastal LA this afternoon, but any severe activity is expected to
remain offshore.
