Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0653 AM CST Thu Mar 07 2024

Valid 071300Z - 081200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PARTS OF THE
SOUTHERN PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Severe hail and thunderstorm gusts are possible over parts of the
southern Plains this afternoon into tonight.

...Synopsis...
The mid/upper-level pattern will remain progressive through the
period, as a strong shortwave trough exits the northeastern CONUS,
and a series of shortwaves traverse an eastward-shifting mean trough
across the West.  The most important of those shortwaves is evident
in moisture-channel imagery over the lower Colorado River Valley
region and nearby parts of southern CA.  This feature should move
eastward across central/southern AZ and adjoining portions of
extreme northwestern MX through the period, reaching southern NM and
-- at its easternmost part -- the TX/NM border region of the Llano
Estacado by 12Z tomorrow.  In the foregoing southwest-flow regime
aloft, several weak/subtle vorticity lobes should cross portions of
the southern Plains States through the period. 

At the surface, 11Z analysis showed a low over southeastern CO, with
wavy and somewhat diffuse warm front across northern parts of the TX
Panhandle and OK, to the western Ozarks.  The low is expected to
migrate across the OK Panhandle to south-central/central KS through
the day, with 00Z trailing cold-frontal position across northwestern
OK and the northern/central TX Panhandle.  By 12Z, the initial low
should reach eastern KS or western MO, with cold front to another
low near SPS, then across the South Plains to southeastern NM.  A
dryline should sharpen through the day with continued moist
advection to its east.  By 00Z, the dryline should extend from the
eastern TX Panhandle southward then south-southwestward to northern
Coahuila.  The cold front will overtake the dryline from north-south
across the eastern Panhandle and northwest TX overnight. 

...Southern Plains...
Isolated, marginally severe hail may occur from elevated
thunderstorms now prevalent over portions of the Arklatex to
southern Ozarks, eastern OK, and south-central KS, and a zone of
steep lapse rates aloft, low-level warm advection and moisture
transport above the surface.  However, the main severe threat will
be later today.

Isolated to scattered thunderstorms -- forming along/ahead of the
dryline this afternoon and persisting/expanding into the overnight
hours -- will be capable of large hail (some potentially 2+ inches
in diameter) and occasional damaging to severe gusts.  The tornado
risk is more sparse and conditional, given a lack of more-robust
moisture.  A bimodal overall severe-threat distribution still is
apparent, with the greatest cumulative convective concentrations
likely centered on western OK to southern KS, and that part of
west-central to north-central TX in and south of the ongoing
convective band.  With some reservations, a relative probabilistic
minimum will be maintained over the northwest TX region, but with
the understanding that any storm forming/sustaining in the
environment just east of the dryline still may become a supercell
capable of strong-severe gusts and significant hail.

Favorable destabilization will develop over the dryline and nearby
moist sector by mid/late afternoon, but in different ways from
north-south.  More sustained/direct insolation and colder air aloft
is expected over northern areas where the ongoing high-cloud plume
will be less dense, and should exit sooner.  In southern areas,
shorter duration/weaker magnitude of diabatic heating will be offset
to some extent by greater ambient moisture/theta-e.  Each process
will weaken MLCINH enough to support surface-based convection this
afternoon into evening.  Aside from the dryline and front, foci for
development may include outflow/differential-heating boundaries from
morning activity, and a persistent low-level convergence zone
already apparent near I-20 from the Big Country into north-central
TX.  While denser convection training along in that convergence zone
may disfavor sustained large-hail potential, embedded supercells are
possible, and isolated discrete supercells may offer severe to
significant hail farther south.  Forecast soundings south of the
convergence zone reasonably show rich inflow-layer moisture, strong
mid/upper winds and deep shear near the subtropical jet (with 60-75
kt effective-shear magnitudes possible), and long, nearly straight,
somewhat hook-shaped hodographs.  Splitting storms are possible with
severe-hail potential from left- or right-moving supercells.

Overnight, as large-scale ascent strengthens ahead of the
approaching mid/upper trough, multiple rounds of development are
possible, especially in either "slight" risk area.  A large-hail and
sporadic damaging-wind threat will exist with any such convection.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1020 AM CST Wed Mar 06 2024

Valid 061700Z - 071200Z

The previous forecast remains largely on track. The only appreciable
change made to the Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook was to expand Elevated
highlights eastward into central Minnesota and northern Iowa. Here,
the latest guidance consensus shows 25-30 percent RH coinciding with
15-20 mph sustained southerly surface winds for at least a few hours
this afternoon.

..Squitieri.. 03/06/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0150 AM CST Wed Mar 06 2024/

...Synopsis...
A northern-stream midlevel shortwave trough will track eastward
across the northern Plains, while an attendant surface cyclone and
trailing cold front move east-northeastward across the Dakotas early
in the period. Along/ahead of the front, a tightening surface
pressure gradient, coupled with boundary-layer mixing into a 45-50
kt low-level jet, will yield 20-25 mph sustained southerly surface
winds (with gusts upwards of 45 mph) across parts of eastern SD,
western MN, northeast NE, and far northwest IA. Here, 25-35 percent
minimum RH will support an elevated to near-critical fire-weather
risk, given the strong/gusty surface winds atop modestly receptive
fuels.

Farther south, midlevel westerly flow will strengthen across the
southern Rockies -- ahead of an approaching midlevel trough/low
moving ashore over southern CA. The strengthening downslope flow off
the southern Rockies, and related lee cyclogenesis over eastern CO,
will favor 15-20 mph sustained southwesterly surface winds (with
higher gusts) amid 15-20 percent afternoon RH across the southern
High Plains. As a result, elevated to spotty critical fire-weather
conditions are expected.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PARTS OF
THE FLORIDA PENINSULA...SOUTH CAROLINA...AND PARTS OF WEST-CENTRAL
TO NORTH TEXAS....

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms are possible this afternoon over parts
of the Florida Peninsula and South Carolina, and late afternoon into
tonight over parts of west-central to north Texas.

...FL...
A warm/moist air mass is present across the central/southeast
portions of the FL Peninsula today, where pockets of daytime heating
will yield afternoon moderate MLCAPE values around 2000 J/kg.  At
least isolated thunderstorms are expected to form across this area
during the afternoon, tracking slowly eastward toward the coast. 
Forecast soundings suggest low/deep layer shear is not particularly
strong, but given the favorable thermodynamics, a few strong to
briefly severe storms capable of hail and damaging winds will be
possible - especially near the east coast.  The severe threat should
diminish after sunset.

...SC...
Multiple weak shortwave troughs are rotating across the Carolinas
today.  One feature is currently over western GA, accompanied by a
cluster of showers.  This activity will move into SC this afternoon,
where daytime heating will help to steepen low level lapse rates and
lead to at least marginal CAPE values.  Low level winds will be
quite veered and relatively weak.  However, a storm or two may be
briefly intense with gusty winds or hail.

...TX...
Clear skies will lead of strong heating and steepening lapse rates
across west-central TX today.  Most CAM solutions suggest one or two
storms could form in the well-mixed zone near San Angelo late this
afternoon.  Steep mid-level lapse rates would support a risk of hail
or damaging wind gusts in these storms.  After dark, a strengthening
southerly low-level jet would likely allow this activity to become
more numerous and spread northeastward toward the Red River.  The
overall severe threat would likely weaken after dark, but could
still pose a risk of occasional hail or gusty winds.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0352 AM CST Tue Mar 05 2024

Valid 081200Z - 131200Z

...DISCUSSION...
Enhanced mid/upper-level flow associated with an upper trough will
overspread much of the southern Plains into the lower MS Valley and
central Gulf Coast States on Day 4/Friday. Thunderstorms should be
ongoing Friday morning across parts of central/east TX. Strong
deep-layer shear should continue to support updraft organization,
with enough MUCAPE present for robust convection. The severe threat
on Friday should shift from TX into the lower MS Valley in tandem
with a northward-developing warm sector and low-level moisture
return. Latest guidance has trended slightly later with the upper
trough ejection, and depicts a somewhat weaker surface low.
Accordingly, it appears that the rich low-level moisture may not
advance as far northward as indicated previously across the central
Gulf Coast States. Have therefore trimmed the northern extent of the
15% severe area for Friday across central MS/AL. There will still be
a severe risk for areas closer to the coast, where a favorable
thermodynamic and kinematic environment should support a threat for
tornadoes, damaging winds, and hail with surface-based convection
through Friday night.

The upper trough and related mid/upper-level jet should continue
moving eastward across the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic regions on Day
5/Saturday. Some severe threat should persist across these areas
through Saturday night. However, there may be a tendency for
convection to outpace the low-level moisture return and gradually
become more elevated with eastward extent across the Southeast.
Still, parts of southern AL into the FL Panhandle/north FL and
GA/SC/NC will be closely monitored for possible inclusion in a 15%
severe area if confidence increases that sufficient instability will
exist to support surface-based thunderstorms and a corresponding
risk for tornadoes and damaging winds. Once the surface cold front
associated with the upper cyclone clears the East Coast on Day
6/Sunday, severe potential should remain minimal across the CONUS
through early next week.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0147 AM CST Tue Mar 05 2024

Valid 061200Z - 071200Z

...Synopsis...
A northern-stream midlevel shortwave trough will cross the northern
Plains during the afternoon, while a related surface cyclone tracks
northeastward from SD across northwestern MN. Along/east of the
surface cyclone, a tightening pressure gradient, coupled with
shallow boundary-layer mixing into a southerly low-level jet, will
yield 20-25 mph sustained southerly surface winds (with gusts
upwards of 45 mph) across portions of northeastern NE, eastern SD,
far northwest IA, and western MN. While RH reductions will be
limited, owing to slightly cool surface temperatures (especially
with northward extent), high-resolution ensemble guidance suggests
that 25-30 percent minimum RH is possible. As a result, an elevated
wind-driven fire-weather risk is expected, given modestly receptive
fuels across the region.

Farther south, midlevel west-southwesterly flow will strengthen
across the southern Rockies -- ahead of midlevel trough/low 
moving ashore over southern CA. In response, weak lee cyclogenesis
is expected over eastern CO, favoring 15-20 mph sustained
southwesterly surface winds (with higher gusts) across the southern
High Plains. Here, downslope warming/drying will contribute to 15
percent minimum RH, leading to elevated/locally critical
fire-weather conditions during the afternoon.

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are unlikely for the remainder of tonight.

...Northern WI into Upper MI...
Thunderstorms are ongoing early this evening across northwest WI,
along and ahead of a cold front attendant to a deep surface cyclone
centered near the ND/MN/MB border. Strong ascent in combination with
steep low/midlevel lapse rates across the region has compensated for
generally limited low-level moisture, though buoyancy remains weak,
with MUCAPE generally less than 500 J/kg. Small hail and gusty winds
will remain possible with these storms as they move across northern
WI into Upper MI and over Lake Superior through the evening. See MCD
187 for more information. 

...Florida...
A downward trend in storm coverage/intensity has been noted over
Florida this evening, though an ongoing storm cluster west of Lake
Okeechobee could pose a threat for small hail and gusty winds for as
long as it persists. Substantial earlier convective overturning over
much of the Peninsula and the loss of diurnal heating should
contribute to a continued overall weakening trend with time tonight.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0333 PM CST Sun Mar 03 2024

Valid 051200Z - 111200Z

A relatively zonal upper pattern will encourage locally dry and
windy conditions across the Plains states Tuesday-Wednesday, before
dry and windy conditions increase across the southern High Plains
later this week in advance of an approaching mid-level trough.
Medium range guidance members show some potential for Critical
overlapping winds/RH somewhere from the Texas/New Mexico border to
the Rio Grande during the Thursday-Saturday period. However, the
medium range members vary too much in placement and timing of the
aforementioned Critical winds/RH for Critical probabilities to be
introduced at this time. Nonetheless, prolonged dry conditions are
expected to continue through the week across the southern High
Plains, with no appreciable precipitation accumulations expected. As
such, Critical probabilities or fire weather highlights will likely
be introduced at some point later this week across the southern High
Plains once guidance members show better agreement in the placement
and timing of conditions favorable for wildfire spread.
