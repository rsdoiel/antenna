Mesoscale Discussion 0820
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0314 PM CDT Fri May 16 2025

Areas affected...western/central PA to northern VA

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 263...

Valid 162014Z - 162215Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 263
continues.

SUMMARY...A mix of damaging winds and severe hail remains possible
through early evening from western to central Pennsylvania southward
into northern Virginia. A corridor of greater damaging wind
potential is apparent in central Maryland, the District of Columbia,
and far northern Virginia.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorm coverage has steadily increased ahead of a
minor MCV, and separately along a wavy outflow boundary. Measured
strong to severe wind gusts have occurred along the outflow
associated with the MCV. Very strong mid-level winds persist in the
wake of this MCV, as sampled by recent RLX VWP data. With surface
temperatures in the mid to upper 80s ahead of this outflow, yielding
peak MLCAPE of 2000-2500 J/kg, damaging wind swaths are most
probable into central MD to far northern VA. Farther north,
convection has largely struggled, outside of a slow-moving supercell
along the separate outflow boundary in south-central PA. Mixed
severe hail and damaging wind will remain possible here, amid weak
low-level shear/SRH.

Mesoscale Discussion 0819
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0310 PM CDT Fri May 16 2025

Areas affected...much of northeast Texas into much of southern
Arkansas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 162010Z - 162215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered severe storms appear likely later this
afternoon, with large hail and locally damaging gusts the most
likely threats.

DISCUSSION...The primary surface front currently extends from near
Ft. Smith AR southwestward into parts of North Texas, with very
strong instability in place. A special 19Z FWD sounding shows MLCAPE
of 3250 J/kg, along with 0-6 km shear around 55 kt. 

Weak convergence along the front and continued heating should result
in sporadic storm development along this boundary, and the
environment will supercells producing very large hail. Visible
imagery shows towering CU along portions of the front, and
initiation appears likely in the next couple hours.

Mesoscale Discussion 0818
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0230 PM CDT Fri May 16 2025

Areas affected...northeast WI into central Upper MI

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 161930Z - 162130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated severe gusts with small to marginally severe hail
will be possible into early evening with high-based thunderstorms
advancing north-northeast from northeast Wisconsin into central
Upper Michigan.

DISCUSSION...Scattered high-based thunderstorms have developed
downstream of the vertically stacked cyclone over northern MN.
Despite surface dew points only in the 40s to low 50s, storm
development has been sustained where temperatures warmed into the
low to mid 80s. This has yielded a deep inverted-v thermodynamic
profile. Shear within the buoyancy layer appears weak, but the steep
lapse rates through the troposphere will foster small to marginally
severe hail cores. This should enhance downdrafts and could support
strong to severe microbursts as convection spreads northeast through
the rest of the afternoon.

Mesoscale Discussion 0817
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0208 PM CDT Fri May 16 2025

Areas affected...northern Arkansas...eastern Missouri...southern
Illinois...far western Kentucky

Concerning...Tornado Watch 262...

Valid 161908Z - 162115Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 262 continues.

SUMMARY...A threat of very large hail and occasional tornadoes
persists across the watch area, and will eventually spread east into
southern Illinois and western Kentucky. Another watch will likely be
needed soon.

DISCUSSION...A rash of supercells is moving rapidly from
south-central into eastern MO, with isolated cells extending into
northern AR. These storms are ahead of a cold front/dryline where
low-level winds are veering to westerly. Meanwhile, the warm front
is now close to St. Louis, with southerly winds bringing 68+
dewpoints northward into the area.

The combination of cool midlevel temperatures and the ample boundary
layer moisture is resulting in MLCAPE values approaching 4000 J/kg.
This, in combination with effective deep-layer shear over 60 kt, is
providing an extremely favorable environment for very large hail of
3-4" diameter. 

In addition, 0-1 SRH remains in the 150-200 m2/s2 range, which is
sufficient for a tornado risk. In the near term, the greatest
tornado risk is over southeast MO, and will eventually shift into
far southern IL and western KY.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 262
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1155 AM CDT Fri May 16 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Northern Arkansas
  Southwestern Illinois
  Central and Eastern Missouri
  Far Eastern Oklahoma

* Effective this Friday morning and evening from 1155 AM until
  700 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A few tornadoes likely with a couple intense tornadoes possible
  Widespread large hail and scattered very large hail events to 4
    inches in diameter likely
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph likely

SUMMARY...The airmass across the region continues to destabilize
amid strong low-level moisture advection and daytime heating. Robust
thunderstorm development is anticipated over the next few hours as
an approaching cold front interacts with this strong buoyant
airmass. Strong vertical shear is also in place, supporting
supercells as the primary storm mode. All severe hazards are
possible with these supercells, including very large hail up to 4"
in diameter and strong tornadoes.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 80 statute miles
east and west of a line from 70 miles south of Harrison AR to 35
miles north northwest of Saint Louis MO. For a complete depiction of
the watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS
WOU2).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0309 PM CDT Fri May 16 2025

Valid 181200Z - 241200Z

Critical fire weather conditions are expected to linger over the
weekend and into early next week across parts of the southern High
Plains. Long-range guidance continues to depict the amplification of
an upper trough over the Southwest this weekend before ejecting into
the Plains early next week. As this occurs, dry southwesterly flow
should overspread much of the Southwest/southern High Plains, which
will promote multiple days of fire weather concerns. After the
ejection of this wave, ensemble guidance suggests low-amplitude
long-wave ridging will become established over the central CONUS.
This should promote muted surface pressure gradient winds along with
isolated rain chances for most regions with the exception of the
Great Basin and Southwest. 

...D3/Sunday and D4/Monday - Southern High Plains...
Southwesterly flow over the southern/central Rockies will promote
lee troughing along the southern High Plains through early next
week. To the west of a sharpening dryline, west/southwesterly
downslope flow will promote multiple days of dry/windy conditions
with afternoon RH values expected to fall into the single digits to
low teens with 15-25 mph winds. Widespread elevated to critical fire
weather conditions are expected both afternoons as mid-level
impulses propagate into the Plains and result in an eastward surge
of the dryline. The fire weather threat should be greatest across
south-central NM into far West TX where ERCs are currently between
the 80th to 95th percentile. With northward and eastward extent,
ongoing spring green up should modulate the potential for fire
spread. 

...D3/Sunday and D4/Monday - Sacramento Valley...
Dry northerly winds are expected through the Sacramento Valley both
D3/Sun and D4/Mon. Latest deterministic and ensemble guidance
suggests winds between 15-20 mph are likely with RH values falling
into the 20-30% range. Elevated fire weather conditions are
possible, and some fire threat may materialize given ERCs increasing
to near the 80th percentile. However, confidence in
sustained/widespread critical conditions remains too limited for
highlights at this time.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0231 PM CDT Fri May 16 2025

Valid 162000Z - 171200Z

...THERE IS A MODERATE RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
MIDDLE MISSISSIPPI AND LOWER OHIO VALLEYS...

...SUMMARY...
A regional outbreak of severe thunderstorms is likely this afternoon
into tonight across parts of the mid Mississippi, Ohio and Tennessee
Valleys. This will include intense supercells with strong,
potentially long-track tornadoes and very large hail. The threat for
damaging winds in excess of 75 mph will increase into this evening
as storms grow into larger clusters.

...20z Update...
No changes are needed to the current D1 Convective Outlook.

Supercells are ongoing across Missouri producing large hail (up to
3-4 in). These storms will continue eastward through time across the
Moderate Risk. The area ahead of these storms is continuing to warm
and destabilize rapidly, with some increase in low level shear
expected through the evening with an increase in the low level jet.
This will support increasing potential for tornadoes, a couple of
which may be intense and long-track across eastern Missouri into
southern Illinois, southern Indiana, and western Kentucky. See
MCD#817 for more information on the short term risk.

Elsewhere, a cluster of storms continue across portions of the
eastern US from West Virginia to eastern Kentucky which will slowly
move into Virginia and North Carolina. See MCD#816 for more
information on the short term risk.

For more information on the potential risk across southeast Oklahoma
into Texas this afternoon/evening, see previous discussion below.

..Thornton/Mosier.. 05/16/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1128 AM CDT Fri May 16 2025/

...Mid MS Valley to the Mid-Atlantic through tonight...
An occluded 984 mb cyclone will move slowly eastward toward the
upper Great Lakes and fill through tonight, as a trailing cold front
progresses across MO/IL/IN/MI.  Ongoing thunderstorm clusters will
likely persist through the afternoon along the primary
moisture/buoyancy gradient into the northern Mid-Atlantic, and with
a developing cold pool from TN/KY into VA/NC within the warm sector.
 MLCAPE increasing to 2000 J/kg or greater, steepening low-level
lapse rates, and sufficient deep-layer vertical shear (effective
bulk shear of 40-50 kt) will maintain a mix of embedded supercells
and bowing segments capable of producing very large hail (2 inch
diameter or larger), thunderstorm gusts of 60-75 mph, and a couple
of tornadoes.

Farther west and in the wake of the ongoing TN/KY storms, rapid
recovery is underway across southern MO where moisture advection and
strong surface heating will result in rapid destabilization. 
Visible imagery shows evidence of ascent over northwest AR/southwest
MO that will soon interact with the destabilizing warm sector. 
Supercell development is expected by midday into early afternoon
from south central into east central MO, and storms will
subsequently expand in coverage while spreading quickly
east-northeastward across southern/central IL this afternoon and
into IN late this afternoon/evening.  The initial storms in MO will
likely remain semi-discrete with the potential to producing very
large hail (in excess of 3 inches in diameter) and a couple of
strong tornadoes given very long hodograph with sufficient low-level
shear.  Gradual upscale growth into clusters/line segments is
expected through storm interactions, with an increase in the
potential for swaths of 65-85 mph gusts into this evening.  More
isolated supercell development may also occur later this afternoon
along the modifying outflow boundary into KY, where all hazards are
expected.

...Northern IL into Lower MI this afternoon/evening...
An embedded speed max and associated zone of ascent now over
northern MO will eject quickly east-northeastward toward Lower MI by
early tonight.  The degree of moistening/destabilization will be
modulated by how quickly storms form and how widespread coverage is
this afternoon farther to the south from IL into IN.

...AR into southeast OK and northeast/central TX this afternoon...
Despite some cloud cover, surface heating in cloud breaks is
allowing surface temperatures to warm into the 80s with low-mid 70s
boundary-layer dewpoints, beneath midlevel lapse rates in excess of
8 C/km.  Scattered thunderstorm development is expected this
afternoon along the primary wind shift from AR/southeast OK into
northeast and potentially central TX.  MLCAPE of 3000-4000 J/kg and
long hodographs with strong deep-layer shear will favor supercells
capable of producing very large hail (3-4 inches in diameter) with
the initial discrete storms, and damaging gusts of 60-75 mph.  The
tornado threat is less certain given relatively weak low-level shear
(as a result of the primary mass response/low-level jet into the
TN/OH Valleys), and will likely rely on favorable storm
interactions.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0223 PM CDT Fri May 16 2025

Valid 181200Z - 191200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS
OF KANSAS AND NORTH-CENTRAL OKLAHOMA...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms capable of all severe hazards are expected on
Sunday across portions of the central and southern Plains.

...Central/Southern Plains...

An upper shortwave impulse will eject east/northeast from the
southern Rockies into the southern/central Plains on Sunday. Only
modest height falls are forecast to occur for much of the period.
Nevertheless, enhanced southwesterly mid/upper flow will overspread
the region. A lee low is forecast to develop over eastern CO and
spread east into western KS. A surface dryline will extend southward
from southwest KS into western OK and central TX. A warm front
extending west to east along the OK/TX border into southern MO/KY
will lift northward across the Mid-MO/Lower OH Valleys through early
Sunday. A very moist airmass with mid/upper 60s F dewpoints is
expected as far north as northern KS into southern MO. Steep
midlevel lapse rates atop rich boundary layer moisture will result
in moderate to strong destabilization.

Confidence in storm coverage is lower than normal as it is unclear
if capping will be overcome, especially with southward extent into
portions of OK/TX. Convection may be more likely to develop near the
surface triple point in central KS, and eventually further north and
east along the warm frontal zone within the warm advection regime.
Where storms can overcome capping, supercells within a favorably
sheared, strongly unstable environment are expected. An accompany
risk for significant all-hazards severe will accompany this
activity. 

During the evening and overnight hours, elevated convection is
possible in the warm advection regime as the warm front lifts north
across the central Plains. Elevated storms may pose a risk for hail,
or if clustering occurs, some damaging wind potential may develop
with a zone from the Mid-MO Valley vicinity into central MO. 

...Deep South to GA/SC Coast...

Enhanced west/northwest flow  aloft will overspread the region on
Sunday. A stalled boundary may modulate northward through the
afternoon, and a very moist and unstable airmass will be in place
amid moderate vertical shear. Large-scale ascent will be weak, but
any storms that develop could become strong/severe.

0132 PM CDT Fri May 16 2025

Valid 171200Z - 181200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHERN NEW MEXICO...

The primary adjustment for this forecast update was an expansion of
the Elevated risk area into parts of western TX and eastern AZ.
Recent guidance shows relatively good agreement in widespread 15-25
mph winds across much of the Southwest and southern High Plains.
Given antecedent dry conditions (17 UTC relative humidity values in
the single digits to low teens with no appreciable moisture recovery
anticipated), widespread elevated to critical fire weather
conditions are anticipated. Expansion of the Critical risk area was
considered for parts of west/southwest TX, but ERC values remain
near to just below seasonal values. One and ten-hour fuel moisture
values below 10% suggest that the fire threat will primarily be
driven by dead dry grasses, but ongoing green up should also limit
fire spread potential to some degree, especially with east and
northward extent. Consequently, only elevated highlights appear
warranted. Similarly, elevated to critical fire weather conditions
are expected along the Mogollon Rim in eastern AZ where ERCs are
generally near seasonal levels, but some fire activity within the
past week suggests that at least elevated highlights are needed.

..Moore.. 05/16/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0159 AM CDT Fri May 16 2025/

...Synopsis...
A low-latitude midlevel trough, accompanied by a 60-kt southwesterly
speed maximum, will advance northeastward from northern MX across
southern NM during the afternoon. In response, a weak lee
cyclone/trough will deepen over the southern High Plains. 

...Southern New Mexico...
Along the northern periphery of mid/high-level clouds extending from
north-central MX into West TX, mostly clear skies and dry/downslope
trajectories will support deep boundary-layer mixing into the
enhanced southwesterly flow aloft across southern NM. Additionally,
a modest pressure gradient peripheral to the lee cyclone/trough will
contribute to 20-25 mph sustained southwesterly surface winds (with
higher gusts). These strong/gusty winds, combined with single-digit
RH and middle 80s F temperatures, will yield critical fire-weather
conditions atop increasingly receptive fuels.

Valid 171200Z - 181200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS OF
THE SOUTHERN PLAINS AND THE NORTHEAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms producing large to very large hail, damaging
gusts and a couple of tornadoes are possible across the southern
Plains on Saturday. Additional severe storms are possible across the
Northeast.

...Synopsis...

An upper trough extending from the Great Lakes toward the TN
Valley/southern Appalachians will develop east through the period,
moving mostly offshore the Atlantic coast Saturday night/early 
Sunday morning. Further west, an upper trough will dig across the
western U.S., while an upper ridge builds over the Plains. A
shortwave impulse over the southern Rockies is expected to move
through the upper ridge over the southern Plains. Enhanced
west/southwesterly flow associated with the southern Plains impulse
and the larger-scale trough over the East will persist through much
of the period. 

At the surface, a cold front will move across much of the central
Appalachians and Mid-Atlantic/Northeast. The southwest extent of
this boundary will lift northward across OK and parts of the Ozark
Plateau. Meanwhile, a dryline will extend southward across portions
of western OK/TX. 

... Southern Plains to the Lower MS Valley Vicinity...

Rich boundary layer moisture will be in place across the warm sector
east of the dryline and south of the northward retreating warm front
from OK/TX into AR/LA. More modest dewpoints in the low 60s F should
spread into southern KS/MO during the evening/overnight hours as
well. While capping will initially be in place, continued warm
advection and increasing ascent from the midlevel shortwave impulse
ejecting from the southern Rockies should overcome the EML across
north TX into southern OK. Supercell wind profiles with
elongated/straight hodographs and very steep midlevel lapse rates
suggest splitting supercells producing large to very large hail will
be possible. With time, clustering may result in an eastward
progressing MCS moving across the ArkLaTex vicinity during the
evening. 

Overnight, additional convection may develop within the warm frontal
zone from northwest OK/southern KS into southwest MO/northwest AR.
This activity may remain elevated to the north of the warm front.
Nevertheless, vertical shear and thermodynamic conditions will be
favorable for large hail. Some upscale growth may occur with
clusters developing eastward within the baroclinic zone. If this
occurs, some increase in strong wind potential could also occur.

More isolated/conditional risk will extend southwestward along the
surface dryline across west-central/southwest TX toward the Middle
Rio Grande Valley/Del Rio vicinity. Any storms that develop in this
area, or cross the border will pose a risk for large hail and strong
gusts. 

...Northeast...

Modest boundary layer moisture is expected across the region.
Cooling aloft will aid in 500-1000 J/kg MLCAPE ahead of the surface
cold front. Elongated/straight hodographs and greater than 30 kt
effective shear suggest scattered convection may produce hail up to
1.5 inch diameter in the strongest cells. Steepened low-level lapse
rates also may support sporadic strong gusts, especially if any
clustering/linear segments develop.

...Carolinas into the Mid-Atlantic...

Outflow from overnight storms is expected to move across the eastern
Carolinas and the Chesapeake Bay vicinity during the morning. Some
airmass recovery is possible ahead of the eastward advancing cold
front expected to move through later in the afternoon/evening.
However, subsidence and drying aloft may inhibit redevelopment.
Stronger midlevel flow is also expected to weaken through the day.
Overall, severe potential appear low across the Chesapeake with a
more uncertain/conditional risk across the eastern Carolinas. If
storms can develop over eastern NC/SC, some risk for gusty winds and
hail is possible. 

...Deep South...

Large scale ascent will remain nebulous across the region. However,
the composite cold front and outflow from earlier convection will
sag southward through peak heating. A very moist airmass will be in
place, but midlevel lapse rates will be modest, resulting in MLCAPE
around 1000-1500 J/kg. Effective shear magnitudes greater than 35 kt
will support organized convection capable of hail and strong gusts
should any storms develop and become sustained.

...Northern UT into southwest WY...

As the western upper trough digs south/southeast across the Great
Basin, rapid cooling aloft will result in weak destabilization and
numerous storms. A deep, well-mixed boundary layer will support the
potential for severe wind gusts from the stronger cores.

Valid 161630Z - 171200Z

...THERE IS A MODERATE RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS
AFTERNOON/EVENING MIDDLE MISSISSIPPI AND LOWER OHIO VALLEYS...

...SUMMARY...
A regional outbreak of severe thunderstorms is likely this afternoon
into tonight across parts of the mid Mississippi, Ohio and Tennessee
Valleys. This will include intense supercells with strong,
potentially long-track tornadoes and very large hail. The threat for
damaging winds in excess of 75 mph will increase into this evening
as storms grow into larger clusters.

...Mid MS Valley to the Mid-Atlantic through tonight...
An occluded 984 mb cyclone will move slowly eastward toward the
upper Great Lakes and fill through tonight, as a trailing cold front
progresses across MO/IL/IN/MI.  Ongoing thunderstorm clusters will
likely persist through the afternoon along the primary
moisture/buoyancy gradient into the northern Mid-Atlantic, and with
a developing cold pool from TN/KY into VA/NC within the warm sector.
 MLCAPE increasing to 2000 J/kg or greater, steepening low-level
lapse rates, and sufficient deep-layer vertical shear (effective
bulk shear of 40-50 kt) will maintain a mix of embedded supercells
and bowing segments capable of producing very large hail (2 inch
diameter or larger), thunderstorm gusts of 60-75 mph, and a couple
of tornadoes.

Farther west and in the wake of the ongoing TN/KY storms, rapid
recovery is underway across southern MO where moisture advection and
strong surface heating will result in rapid destabilization. 
Visible imagery shows evidence of ascent over northwest AR/southwest
MO that will soon interact with the destabilizing warm sector. 
Supercell development is expected by midday into early afternoon
from south central into east central MO, and storms will
subsequently expand in coverage while spreading quickly
east-northeastward across southern/central IL this afternoon and
into IN late this afternoon/evening.  The initial storms in MO will
likely remain semi-discrete with the potential to producing very
large hail (in excess of 3 inches in diameter) and a couple of
strong tornadoes given very long hodograph with sufficient low-level
shear.  Gradual upscale growth into clusters/line segments is
expected through storm interactions, with an increase in the
potential for swaths of 65-85 mph gusts into this evening.  More
isolated supercell development may also occur later this afternoon
along the modifying outflow boundary into KY, where all hazards are
expected.

...Northern IL into Lower MI this afternoon/evening...
An embedded speed max and associated zone of ascent now over
northern MO will eject quickly east-northeastward toward Lower MI by
early tonight.  The degree of moistening/destabilization will be
modulated by how quickly storms form and how widespread coverage is
this afternoon farther to the south from IL into IN.

...AR into southeast OK and northeast/central TX this afternoon...
Despite some cloud cover, surface heating in cloud breaks is
allowing surface temperatures to warm into the 80s with low-mid 70s
boundary-layer dewpoints, beneath midlevel lapse rates in excess of
8 C/km.  Scattered thunderstorm development is expected this
afternoon along the primary wind shift from AR/southeast OK into
northeast and potentially central TX.  MLCAPE of 3000-4000 J/kg and
long hodographs with strong deep-layer shear will favor supercells
capable of producing very large hail (3-4 inches in diameter) with
the initial discrete storms, and damaging gusts of 60-75 mph.  The
tornado threat is less certain given relatively weak low-level shear
(as a result of the primary mass response/low-level jet into the
TN/OH Valleys), and will likely rely on favorable storm
interactions.

0740 AM CDT Fri May 16 2025

Areas affected...northeast AR into central KY

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 259...

Valid 161240Z - 161445Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 259
continues.

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm cluster may continue to pose a risk for hail
and sporadic strong gusts this morning. Local watch extension may be
needed for portions of Severe Thunderstorm Watch 259.

DISCUSSION...Strong to severe thunderstorms continue from northeast
AR into central KY this morning. While previously a new watch was
considered, given some weakening in the clusters across central KY,
local watch extensions may be more appropriate as uncertainty in
downstream evolution has increased. Nevertheless, a favorable
environment will persist, supporting a continued large hail risk in
the short term. If further upscale growth occurs with ongoing
clusters, a risk for damaging gust potential could increase later
this morning or toward midday downstream from WW 259. Local watch
extensions for 1-2 hours may be need if current trends persist for
another 30-60 minutes.

Areas affected...northeast AR/southeast MO into parts of KY/TN...WV
and western VA

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 259...

Valid 161135Z - 161330Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 259
continues.

SUMMARY...Severe thunderstorms posing a risk for large to very large
hail will persist across Severe Thunderstorm Watch 259. This
activity may maintain severity downstream into eastern Kentucky and
portions of West Virginia and western Virginia. A new watch may be
needed to replace WW 259 and to expand downstream.

DISCUSSION...Scattered severe thunderstorm clusters are ongoing this
morning from northeast AR into central KY. This activity is
occurring in a warm advection regime and on the fringes of an 850 mb
southwesterly low-level jet. While some inhibition is present in the
low-levels given the nocturnally cooled boundary layer, MUCAPE from
1000-2000 J/kg is in place amid a moist airmass. Elongated/straight
supercell profiles and cool temperatures aloft also are present.
Thus, a large hail threat will accompany any more discrete
convection. 

Recent radar trends suggest clustering may be underway near the MO
Bootheel and into western KY. If this continues, convection could
develop into a small MCS and move across KY toward WV/VA, posing a
risk for strong/severe wind gusts as well as the downstream airmass
destabilizes and inhibition erodes later this morning as diurnal
heating ensues. 

An isolated cell also is approaching the edge of WW 259 across
central KY and a downstream watch and/or larger watch replacement
may be needed soon.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 259
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
225 AM CDT Fri May 16 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  North-central and Northeast Arkansas
  Southern Illinois
  Southwest Indiana
  Western Kentucky
  Southeast Missouri
  Northwest Tennessee

* Effective this Friday morning from 225 AM until 900 AM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2
    inches in diameter likely
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Scattered severe thunderstorms are expected to develop and
move rapidly northeast across the watch area early this morning.
Large hail and damaging thunderstorm gusts will be the primary
severe weather hazard, although a tornado or two will also be
possible.Scattered severe thunderstorms are expected to develop and

move rapidly northeast across the watch area early this morning.
Large hail and damaging thunderstorm gusts will be the primary
severe weather hazard, although a tornado or two will also be
possible.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 60
statute miles north and south of a line from 30 miles south
southwest of Flippin AR to 20 miles north northeast of Bowling Green

KY. For a complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch
outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU9).

Mesoscale Discussion 0794
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0322 PM CDT Thu May 15 2025

Areas affected...Parts of central and northern Illinois

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 152022Z - 152215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Large to very large hail and severe winds will be possible
with supercells that can develop later this afternoon. Watch timing
is uncertain but is possible later this afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Cumulus are developing along an eastward moving dryline
near the Mississippi River. Ahead of this boundary, a strongly
unstable airmass is in place (low 90s F temperatures and mid 60s to
low 70s F dewpoints). With the strongest mid-level ascent to the
northwest of the region, timing of storm initiation as well as storm
coverage are uncertain. However, given the lack of MLCIN, a isolated
to widely scattered development appears possible later this
afternoon. 45-55 kts of effective shear will support supercells. The
primary hazards will be large to very large hail and severe winds.
The tornado threat is expected to be less than farther north given
the slightly veered low-level winds and more sizable
temperature/dewpoint spreads at the surface.

Mesoscale Discussion 0793
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0307 PM CDT Thu May 15 2025

Areas affected...portions of central Arkansas into western
Tennessee...far southeast Missouri...far southwestern Kentucky

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 252...

Valid 152007Z - 152130Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 252
continues.

SUMMARY...Ongoing storms may still reach severe limits, with
damaging gusts and large hail the main concerns. These storms may
persist downstream of Severe Thunderstorm Watch 252, so a local
extension of the ongoing watch, or the issuance of a new downstream
Severe Thunderstorm Watch, may be needed.

DISCUSSION...Strong thunderstorms (still possibly elevated) continue
across AR amid a pronounced EML atop rich low-level moisture and
strong deep-layer shear. As such, any storm cores that can intensify
will continue to pose at least a severe hail threat. Severe gusts
are also possible if ongoing storms can become surface based by
either rooting into the boundary layer, or establishing a strong
cold pool, which could lift surface-based parcels to the LFC along
the cold pool leading edge. It remains uncertain if these storms
have peaked in intensity or if greater severe potential exists
downstream. As such, an eastward extension of the ongoing Severe
Thunderstorm Watch, or the issuance of a new watch, may be needed
pending favorable convective trends.

0300 PM CDT Thu May 15 2025

Areas affected...Portions of northwest Wisconsin

Concerning...Tornado Watch 251...

Valid 152000Z - 152130Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 251 continues.

SUMMARY...Tornado potential, including a strong tornado, will shift
into portions of northwest Wisconsin over the next 1-2 hours.

DISCUSSION...A broken line of supercells continues north and east.
These storms will move across the River and into northwest Wisconsin
shortly. Temperatures have risen into low 80s F with dewpoints
remaining near 64 F. Given the storm mode, low-level thermodynamics,
and backed surface winds, this area will be the primary focus for
tornado potential over the next 1-2 hours. Storms have remained in
close proximity to one another, but still sufficiently discrete that
overall inflow quality remains favorable for low-level mesocyclone
intensification. With objective mesoanalysis showing STP of 2-3, a
strong tornado remains possible.

Mesoscale Discussion 0791
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0214 PM CDT Thu May 15 2025

Areas affected...Parts of southern Wisconsin into northern Illinois

Concerning...Severe potential...Tornado Watch likely 

Valid 151914Z - 152115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...A tornado watch will likely be needed this afternoon.
Supercells capable of all severe hazards are expected within the
next few hours.

DISCUSSION...Cumulus continue to deepen both along a dryline and an
area of confluence within the Mississippi Valley. Whether storms
develop within the confluence or when the dryline reaches the
Mississippi River remains a question. 40-50 kts of effective shear
across these surface convergence zones will favor supercells as
storms develop. Large to very large hail will be a concern as well
as severe wind gusts. The 18Z DVN sounding sampled very steep
mid-level lapse rates and a long hodograph. Tornado potential will
also be present. Surface temperature/dewpoint spreads are near 20 F,
but low-level shear and a supercellular mode will favor low-level
rotation. The time frame of greater tornado potential will likely be
22-00Z when the low-level jet increases in southern Wisconsin.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 252
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
155 PM CDT Thu May 15 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  North-Central into Northeast Arkansas
  Far Western Kentucky
  Far Southeast Missouri
  Far Northwest Tennessee

* Effective this Thursday afternoon and evening from 155 PM until
  700 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail likely with isolated very large hail events
    to 2.5 inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph likely

SUMMARY...Line of storms moving through north-central Arkansas
continues to organize as it moves quickly eastward. The downstream
airmass is warm and buoyant, suggesting the potential for this
cluster to continue over the next few hours. Strong gusts and large
to very large hail are possible with this cluster, as well any other
storms that develop across the region.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 75
statute miles east and west of a line from 15 miles east northeast
of Poplar Bluff MO to 55 miles east southeast of Russellville AR.
For a complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch
outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU2).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1137 AM CDT Thu May 15 2025

Valid 151700Z - 161200Z

Cooler temperatures and lighter boundary layer winds will mitigate
fire weather concerns across southeastern Arizona today,
necessitating a slight pullback in Elevated highlights. Stronger
mid-level winds and efficient mixing will continue to support an
elevated fire weather threat across southern New Mexico into far
west Texas. Downslope/leeward enhancement of surface winds should 
also occur across the High Plains of northeastern New Mexico.

..Williams.. 05/15/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0104 AM CDT Thu May 15 2025/

...Synopsis...
An upper trough will quickly move eastward over the central US with
accompanying strong mid-level flow. A deepening lee cyclone will
intensify further as it move into the Upper Midwest tonight. As the
low deepens, a Pacific cold front and tailing dryline will move
quickly through the Rockies, into the Plains and Midwest States.
Cooler temperatures, gusty westerly winds and some precipitation are
possible along and behind the front through tonight. Elevated
fire-weather conditions are possible over parts of the southern
Plains and Southwest.

...Southwest...
Persistent westerly flow will continue across the Southwest today
and tonight as a weak pacific front moves over the Rockies. This
will support another day of dry and windy conditions across parts of
eastern AZ and southern NM. Despite somewhat cooler temperatures
behind the front, downsloping  and deep vertical mixing will support
RH below 20% and winds of 15-20% amidst dry fuels. Widespread
elevated to locally critical conditions are expected. Some
fire-weather risk may also extend into West TX behind an eastward
mixing dryline. However, winds here may be somewhat weaker despite
very warm surface temperatures and lower humidity. Locally elevated
conditions are possible within drying fuels.

...Central plains and Midwest...
Gusty westerly winds are possible behind the advancing cold front
from parts of the central Plains into western IA and MO this
afternoon. While gusts may reach 20-25 mph, RH values are not
expected to be critical with cooler temperatures. Additionally,
recent wetting rainfall may temporarily limit available fuels. This
suggests any fire-weather concerns will be localized and short
lived.

Mesoscale Discussion 0785
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0723 AM CDT Thu May 15 2025

Areas affected...Southeast SD...southern MN...extreme northeast
NE/northwest IA

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 151223Z - 151400Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...A threat for strong to isolated severe storms may continue
through the morning.

DISCUSSION...A long-lived storm cluster is ongoing this morning
across south-central MN. This system has persisted longer than most
guidance would suggest, and is likely being aided by persistent
moisture transport associated with a strong low-level jet. While
this system remains relatively disorganized with outflow tending to
outpace the deeper convection, localized strong wind gusts and hail
will be possible, especially where new updrafts develop and briefly
intensify behind the outflow. 

To the southwest, renewed storm development is underway across
southeast SD and far northeast NE, immediately in advance of a
compact but vigorous midlevel shortwave trough moving across
north-central NE/south-central SD. Rather strong low-level
southeasterly flow will maintain moisture transport into the region
through the morning ahead of a cold front, and development of
somewhat more organized convection will be possible with time. In
the short term, convection will tend to be somewhat elevated, but
could become rooted closer to the surface later this morning,
especially with southeast extent. Some hail and strong-gust
potential could evolve if convection is able to deepen and intensify
within this regime.  

With the threat expected to remain rather isolated over the next 1-2
hours, short-term watch issuance is considered unlikely. Trends will
continue to be monitored for intensification with time this morning.

Mesoscale Discussion 0778
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0307 PM CDT Wed May 14 2025

Areas affected...Southwest into central Nebraska

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 142007Z - 142200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Large/very-large hail and severe winds will be the primary
threats as storms develop and mature this afternoon and evening.
Supercells on the southern end of the activity may have slightly
higher associated tornado threat. A watch is likely late this
afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Dewpoints have held in the low 60s F in central
Nebraska this afternoon. Cumulus towers and recent lightning have
been observed in Cherry County in the last hour along a surface
boundary. Water vapor imagery shows ascent increasing in Colorado as
a shortwave trough continues to pivot northeastward. This ascent
should reach western/southwestern Nebraska later this afternoon. In
the near term, additional storms appear probable as
heating/convergence continue along the boundary. The eastern
boundary is the most likely zone for initiation, though additional
storms could form on the weaker boundary to the west. With
deep-layer shear having a more westerly component this far south,
which should be maintained/modestly increase as the trough ejects
this evening, a mixed mode of linear segments and supercells can be
expected. Supercells will be favored with southern extent.

Modestly steep mid-level lapse rates and increasing shear by the
evening will support organized storms capable of large/very-large
hail (particularly supercells) and severe winds. While the low-level
jet response this evening is not expected to be overly strong, a
supercell along the southern flank of the activity may have slightly
higher tornado potential.

A watch is likely by late afternoon. Timing of watch issuance is
somewhat uncertain given greater storm coverage may wait until
greater mid-level ascent arrives by 22-00Z.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 247
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
350 PM CDT Wed May 14 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Western and Central Nebraska
  South-Central and Central South Dakota

* Effective this Wednesday afternoon and evening from 350 PM
  until 1100 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 75
    mph possible
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 3
    inches in diameter possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms should continue to gradually increase in
coverage and intensity this afternoon and evening. Supercells should
pose a threat for large to very large hail potentially up to 2-3
inches in diameter, especially across parts of western into central
Nebraska. Otherwise, scattered severe wind gusts may occur with any
clusters that eventually form. A tornado or two also appears
possible, mainly this evening.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 45
statute miles east and west of a line from 35 miles north of Pierre
SD to 25 miles east southeast of Imperial NE. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU7).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
3 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 65 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
20030.

Mesoscale Discussion 0774
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0746 AM CDT Tue May 13 2025

Areas affected...Parts of eastern NC into southeast VA

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 131246Z - 131445Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...A localized brief-tornado and wind-damage threat may
persist through the morning.

DISCUSSION...Extensive convection is ongoing this morning across
eastern NC into southeast VA. Weak instability (MLCAPE generally 500
J/kg or less) is limiting updraft intensity, with lightning
primarily confined to somewhat deeper convection near the NC coast.
However, to the east of the slow-moving midlevel cyclone centered
over western TN/KY, rather strong low-level flow continues to be
noted on the KMHX and KAKQ VWPs, supporting effective SRH of 150-200
m2/s2. Small cells with occasional rotation have persisted from
northeast NC into far southeast VA, and some localized threat for a
brief tornado and wind damage could persist through the morning with
these smaller cells. 

Farther south, an extensive convective cluster is ongoing off the NC
coast, with some evidence of an MCV south of Morehead City. This
cluster could spread northward toward the immediate coast and Outer
Banks with time, with embedded cells potentially posing a threat of
strong gusts and a brief tornado, especially where surface dewpoints
remain near 70 F this morning.

0139 PM CDT Sun May 11 2025

Areas affected...eastern Idaho into western Wyoming and southwest
Montana

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 111839Z - 112115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Storms should gradually increase in coverage and intensity
from eastern Idaho into southwest Montana, with both hail and gust
potential.

DISCUSSION...A line of convection continue to increase in intensity
over the upper Snake River Plain, with both strong heating and
low-level warm advection ahead of it. Continued steepening of
deep-layer lapse rates as the upper trough moves in the from the
west and more heating should support further strengthening of this
convection. Strong deep-layer shear will favor hail production with
these storms over eastern ID. A brief/weak tornado cannot be ruled
out with the stronger cells this afternoon, as low-level stretching
is maximized.

Farther north toward the Bitterroots, stronger cooling aloft is
occurring, and areas of heating persist ahead of this activity as
well. Long hodographs and cold midlevel temperatures will favor hail
with these storms through the day.

0221 PM CDT Sun May 11 2025

Areas affected...central Florida northward toward southeast Georgia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 111921Z - 112145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Storms are forecast to increase in coverage throughout the
afternoon from the central Florida Peninsula into northeast Florida
and southeast Georgia.

DISCUSSION...Storms are currently increasing east of Tampa to west
of Okeechobee where strong heating has led to strong instability.
The southerly flow regime should support a north/northeast movement
to this development, affecting the remainder of central into
northeastern Florida. Breaks in the clouds in those downstream areas
are developing, and this should further increase instability.
Although temperatures aloft are not as cool as previous days, MUCAPE
over 2000 J/kg and deep-layer shear of 35-40 kt will support
cellular storm mode with sporadic hail > 1.00" expected. Locally
strong to damaging gusts cannot be ruled out as well, especially
with any merging outflows.

increase this afternoon across eastern ID, northern UT, and western
WY. Environmental conditions support the potential for strong to
severe storms capable of strong gusts. Isolated large hail is also
possible, particularly in areas of higher terrain.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 80
statute miles east and west of a line from 65 miles north northeast
of Idaho Falls ID to 40 miles southwest of Salt Lake City UT. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU5).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
1.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 70 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
23035.

Mesoscale Discussion 0766
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0149 PM CDT Sun May 11 2025

Areas affected...Portions of southeast Georgia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 111849Z - 112045Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...A locally greater risk for damaging winds and perhaps a
tornado is evident in southeast Georgia near a local warm front
feature.

DISCUSSION...A small corridor in southeast Georgia has heated into
the low 80s F. A few weak discrete cells exist near the
Georgia/South Carolina state line. One cell has recently intensified
and shown signs of low-level rotation. The localized warm front
feature will promote at least marginal potential for a brief tornado
with southeasterly winds near the boundary. Nearby KCLX radar
accordingly shows modest 0-1 km SRH. Over the next hour or two this
environment will support a locally greater risk for damaging winds
and perhaps a tornado. The discrete cells will have the greatest
potential, but stronger updrafts within the linear segment farther
southwest could also acquire low-level rotation as well.

Mesoscale Discussion 0764
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0130 PM CDT Sun May 11 2025

Areas affected...Salt Lake Vicinity

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 111830Z - 112030Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Severe wind gusts will be possible this afternoon with
high-based showers and embedded thunderstorms.

DISCUSSION...With temperatures rising into the low/mid 80s F in the
vicinity of Salt Lake, high-based showers and isolated thunderstorms
have deepened over the last hour. A few of these storms have
produced 58-63 mph measured gusts in Tooele/Salt Lake Counties.
While low-level wind fields are not overly strong, the 9.2 C/km
700-500 mb lapse rate observed in this mornings 12Z SLC sounding,
coupled with steep low-level lapse rates and high surface dewpoint
depressions, will continue to support strong diabatically driven
downdrafts. Severe wind gusts will remain possible through the
afternoon in association with this weak, disorganized convection.

Mesoscale Discussion 0756
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0708 AM CDT Sat May 10 2025

Areas affected...Parts of the FL Panhandle into far southeast AL

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 101208Z - 101415Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...A localized tornado and wind-damage threat may spread
eastward this morning.

DISCUSSION...A persistent storm cluster with embedded supercells is
moving eastward this morning across the FL Panhandle, to the east of
a surface low near Mobile Bay. Occasional upticks in rotation have
been noted over the last hour as cells interact with a frontal zone
that is very gradually moving northward across the area. Some
additional northward progression of the front is possible through
the morning, aided by the onset of modest diurnal heating downstream
of ongoing convection. This would increase the area across the
peninsula where an organized severe threat could evolve over the
next 2-3 hours. A supercell currently south of Fort Walton Beach
could pose a threat if it moves onshore, and additional cell
development is possible within developing convection west of Panama
City. 

Near and south of the front, favorable low-level moisture and
veering wind profiles (with effective SRH increasing above 100
m2/s2) will continue to support localized tornado and wind-damage
potential with any sustained supercells.

Mesoscale Discussion 0757
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0758 AM CDT Sat May 10 2025

Areas affected...North FL into far southeast GA

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 101258Z - 101430Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Strong to locally severe storms are possible this morning.

DISCUSSION...A long-lived MCS has moved inland across the FL Big
Bend region this morning. This system has generally been subsevere
thus far since moving inland and has shown signs of weakening, but
filtered downstream heating of a moist airmass will result in MLCAPE
approaching 1000 J/kg with time this morning. This could allow some
intensification as the remnant storm cluster approaches northeast
FL, with an attendant threat of locally damaging winds. Storms
developing ahead of this cluster could also approach severe limits
through the morning.
