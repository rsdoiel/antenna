Mesoscale Discussion 1952
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0141 PM CDT Fri Aug 15 2025

Areas affected...northern/central IA and adjacent WI/MN/IL

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 589...

Valid 151841Z - 152015Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 589
continues.

SUMMARY...Strong to locally severe wind threat should increase into
late afternoon with an eastward-progressing cluster from
north-central Iowa. An additional Severe Thunderstorm Watch may be
warranted downstream.

DISCUSSION...Despite the presence of a cluster that has accelerated
to around 40-kt easterly movement, surface wind gusts appear to not
even be strong yet, which could be related to the initially elevated
character of the cluster and modest cold pool/warm sector
temperature differences from 10-15 F. MLCIN appears to be finally
minimizing downstream and thus strong to sporadic severe gusts
should develop on approach to peak heating as the cluster spreads
into the northeast IA vicinity. Hail growth will probably remain
limited and generally confined along the trailing west/southwest
flank where mid-level lapse rates remain steep per the 18Z OAX
sounding, but with only 20-kt effective bulk shear at this latitude.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 589
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1230 PM CDT Fri Aug 15 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  North-Central Iowa

* Effective this Friday afternoon from 1230 PM until 500 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph likely
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Convective cluster ongoing across northwest IA has shown a
strengthening trend over the last hour or so as it moves into the
moist and destabilizing airmass downstream across north-central IA.
Isolated hail and scattered damaging gusts are possible with this
line as it moves over north-central IA this afternoon.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 60
statute miles north and south of a line from 40 miles west of Fort
Dodge IA to 50 miles south southeast of Mason City IA. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU9).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
1.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
27035.

1235 PM CDT Fri Aug 15 2025

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR MUCH OF SOUTH
DAKOTA...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are possible Saturday over South
Dakota primarily during the late afternoon through the late evening
period.  Large hail and severe gusts appear to be the primary
hazards with the stronger storms.

...Northern Great Plains...
A mid-level ridge centered over the lower MS Valley/Mid South will
feature a weak disturbance moving from the WY/CO vicinity into the
Dakotas Saturday night.  A residual composite front will remain
draped east-west from the Upper Midwest into western SD, where it
will intersect a lee trough from the central High Plains
north-northwestward into eastern MT.  Although large-scale ascent
will remain fairly weak across the region, isolated thunderstorms
will likely develop in the vicinity of the lee trough and Black
Hills by the late afternoon as convective inhibition erodes.  To the
north of the front, a moist and unstable airmass featuring a
moderate to very unstable boundary layer will develop by mid-late
afternoon.  Model guidance shows a gradual increase in storm
coverage during the early evening over western/central SD.  Ample
directional shear will support effective shear magnitudes 30-40 kt
and storm organization with the stronger storms.  Large hail and
severe gusts appear to be the primary threats.

...Midwest...
A linear cluster of thunderstorms is expected to be ongoing Saturday
morning across parts of the Upper MS Valley/western Great Lakes. 
Model guidance differs on the evolution of this potentia
shower/thunderstorm activity, but west-northwesterly mid-level flow
poleward of a mid-level anticyclone centered over the lower MS
Valley, will potentially favor some continuation of storms
downstream across the southwestern Great Lakes.  Models continue to
show a moist/unstable airmass across southern portions of the Great
Lakes.  Although large-scale ascent will remain weak across the
region, regenerative storm development on remnant outflow may yield
a subsequent evolution of a storm cluster but uncertainty remains
high.  Isolated damaging gusts/hail are the main threats with these
storms.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1149 AM CDT Fri Aug 15 2025

Valid 151700Z - 161200Z

...Dry Thunderstorms...
Thermodynamic profiles continue to be supportive of dry thunderstorm
development over portions of Northeast NV into southern ID/western
WY and southward along the central UT mountain chain. Enhanced
southwesterly flow associated with a trough over the Great Basin
will support faster storm motions, particularly from a corridor from
northeastern Nevada into southeastern ID, further limiting rainfall
potential. A clearly evident, deeper moisture plume depicted by
satellite imagery currently translating northward from northern AZ
into eastern UT, should promote more wetting rain cores out of
expected higher terrain shower/thunderstorm development this
afternoon. PWATs across the Colorado Plateau and Western Slope
should remain at or above 0.80" limiting lightning ignition
efficiency in this region. Orographically forced convection and a
few thunderstorms with limited rainfall across the Central Sierra
Nevada mountains are also expected over increasingly dry fuels. 

...Southern Nevada, southeastern Idaho and far southwest Montana...
The mid-level trough will also support a swath of enhanced south to
southwest winds (15-20 mph) across southern and eastern NV as well
as portions of central ID mountains and Upper Snake River Plain. The
winds combined with a dry boundary layer and surface relative
humidity of 15% or below will promote elevated fire weather
conditions amid dry fuels.

..Williams.. 08/15/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0159 AM CDT Fri Aug 15 2025/

...Synopsis...
Broad mid-level ridging over the Central US is forecast to build
today, as weak westerly flow passes over it. Weak troughing over the
Great Basin will gradually shift eastward bolstering mid-level flow
over the region. A weak lee low over the High Plains will support
west/southwesterly winds over much of the Great Basin and
Intermountain West through this afternoon. 15-20 mph gusts will
overlap with very warm and dry conditions (RH below 15) from eastern
NV into portions of UT, WY and ID.  Several hours of elevated fire
weather conditions are probable given very dry and receptive fuels.

...Dry Thunder...
Weak height falls from the upper trough over the West will continue
to overspread robust monsoon moisture supporting isolated
thunderstorms this afternoon. Similar to previous days, a
combination of steep mid-level lapse rates and modest mid-level
moisture will overlap with dry boundary layer conditions and high
cloud bases. This will favor dry storms with limited potential for
wetting rainfall. The favorable thermodynamic conditions, coupled
with 15-25 knot storm motions over top receptive fuels will continue
to support dry lightning potential with these storms over the
eastern Great Basin and central Rockies.

Valid 151630Z - 161200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON AND
TONIGHT FROM PARTS OF SOUTH DAKOTA INTO THE UPPER MIDWEST...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong to severe storms are likely today and tonight over
parts of the northern Plains and Upper Mississippi Valley.

...MN/IA/WI...
Recent satellite imagery shows a pair of convectively generated
vorticity maxima moving across the northern/central Plains, with the
northernmost vorticity max over the eastern ND/SD border and the
southernmost vorticity max over north-central NE. Showers and
thunderstorms have persisted near these features over the last
several hours, but the strongest cells in both of these clusters
have recently shown a weakening trend. A moist and buoyant airmass,
characterized by dewpoints in the upper 60s/low 70s, exists
downstream and redevelopment is possible ahead of both of these
vorticity maxima. How that redevelopment evolves is uncertain, with
recent guidance offering varied solutions regarding overall coverage
and evolution. 

Redevelopment appears most probable with the southern vorticity
maxima, given the ample moist and buoyancy that exists downstream.
This development should grow upscale quickly, with the resulting
convective cluster then tracking southeastward. Recent guidance
continues to trend farther south, so the wind probabilities were
extended southward to cover this potential. Damaging gusts appear
like the most likely threat through the evening. Current progression
of the northern vorticity maximum takes it into a less buoyant
airmass across central MN and northern WI, and redevelopment
along/ahead of this disturbance appears less likely. 

Depending on the strength of the IA cluster, additional development
is possible in its wake amid a strengthening low-level jet and
associated warm-air advection over its outflow. Steep mid-level
lapse rates should still be in place, supporting strong updrafts and
large hail with these elevated storms. 

Lastly, a decaying convective line may reach the southwestern
MN/northwestern IA vicinity late in the period. Given the potential
for preceding storms, the amount of buoyancy that will still be in
place remains is uncertain. However, if thunderstorm coverage is low
or most storms develop farther east, enough buoyancy could remain to
support strong updrafts capable of damaging gusts and/or hail within
the convective line or any preceding more cellular storms.

..NE/SD this afternoon through tonight...
Strong heating and ample mid-level moisture will result in scattered
high-based thunderstorm development across eastern WY and western
NE/SD by late afternoon. Isolated hail and strong gusts are possible
with this initial activity. This activity will then track
east-northeastward through the early evening into a progressively
more moist and unstable air mass across NE and SD. The combination
of improving thermodynamic environment and an intensifying nocturnal
low-level jet will likely aid in thunderstorm intensification and
upscale growth through the evening across northern NE and central
SD. Guidance continues to vary significantly with the strength of
this MCS, but general consensus would suggest the threat for strong
to severe gusts will persist across SD tonight. There is at least a
low probability for the development of a well-organized MCS that
could produce significant severe gusts. However, that probability is
currently too low to introduce an unconditional sig wind area.

...TX Coastal Plain into the Hill Country and Southeast TX...
A maturing tropical disturbance is near south TX, with associated
outflow currently spreading northward across the TX Coastal Plain.
Limited lightning has been noted with in the short-lived cores that
have been developing along this outflow. This process of brief
intensification along this outflow is expected throughout the day,
with an overall increase in thunderstorm coverage anticipated. A
modest increase in low to mid-level flow is expected along the
eastern periphery of this system, spreading northward into central
and southeast TX. Even so, shear will remain weak, with a
disorganized multicellular pulse storm mode anticipated. Given the
very moist profiles (i.e. PW values over 2"), a few water-loaded
downbursts are possible, but should be isolated enough to preclude
the need for severe probabilities.
