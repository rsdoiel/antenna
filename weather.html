Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0732 AM CDT Fri Jun 14 2024

Valid 141300Z - 151200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE CENTRAL
PLAINS AND NORTHEAST STATES/NEW ENGLAND...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe storms with large hail and wind gusts of 60-80 mph
will be possible from mid-afternoon through evening along the Front
Range to the central Great Plains. Scattered strong storms with
sporadic damaging winds and isolated hail will also be possible
across the Northeast States during the afternoon to early evening.

...Central Plains including Colorado/Nebraska/Kansas...
A mid/upper-level low over the Lower Colorado River Valley early
this morning will continue northeastward, reaching the
central/southern High Plains by evening. An outflow-reinforced front
is expected to slowly shift north-northeastward across the central
High Plains through the day, with low-level southeasterly flow
maintaining a relatively moisture-rich airmass across the central
High Plains toward the Front Range.

Thinking continues to be that at least scattered thunderstorm
development is expected by mid/late afternoon across parts of
Colorado/New Mexico including the Front Range and Raton Mesa
vicinity, influenced by differential heating and the approaching
shortwave trough. Moderate buoyancy and marginally favorable
deep-layer shear (30-40 kt) will support large hail potential with
initial discrete storm development, along with some risk for a brief
tornado or two.

A tendency toward more of a clustered mode is expected with time,
as storm coverage increases. As this occurs, isolated to widely
scattered wind gusts of 60-80 mph will be possible, especially in
areas where stronger pre-storm heating/mixing occurs. A loosely
organized MCS could eventually evolve near/north of the surface
boundary, which would result in some severe-wind potential spreading
eastward across Nebraska and western/northern Kansas tonight.

...Northern High Plains/northern Rockies...
Moderate diurnal destabilization will be possible near/east of a
weak surface low across the northern High Plains, with modest
instability extending westward across parts of the northern Rockies.
Isolated to widely scattered thunderstorms will be possible by late
afternoon into the evening, with sufficient deep-layer shear to
support a few stronger storms capable of producing isolated hail and
strong-to-severe wind gusts.

...Northeast/Mid-Atlantic States and New England...
A mid/upper-level trough will move across the Mid-Atlantic and New
England later today into tonight. Weak to moderate buoyancy will
develop along/ahead of a cold front, with scattered thunderstorm
development expected from Pennsylvania into New England, and more
isolated development possible farther south into parts of the
central Appalachians and Mid-Atlantic. Moderate deep-layer shear
will support some storm organization, and few stronger clusters
and/or marginal supercells will be possible, with an attendant
threat of locally damaging winds and hail.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook

...DISCUSSION...
...Saturday/Day 4 to Saturday/Day 5...
On Saturday, an upper-level trough is forecast to move northeastward
across the southern and central High Plains. An axis of instability
is forecast to be further to the northwest across the western
Dakotas. As a mid-level jet passes northeastward across the northern
Rockies, large-scale ascent and deep-layer shear should be strong
enough for an isolated severe thunderstorms in parts of the northern
High Plains. Large hail and severe wind gusts will be possible, but
uncertainty exists concerning the spatial distribution of the
threat.

The trough in the central Plains is forecast to move into the upper
Mississippi Valley on Sunday, with a large pocket of instability
located in its wake across the central Plains. Although large-scale
ascent within this unstable airmass is expected to be weak, isolated
severe storms could develop in the late afternoon and early evening.


Further to the northwest, model forecasts show potential for storm
development in parts of the northern High Plains Sunday evening. If
this were to occur, MCS development, and an isolated severe threat,
could occur across parts of the northern Plains Sunday night.

...Monday/Day 6 to Wednesday/Day 8...
On Monday, a mid-level jet is forecast to move northeastward into
the northern Plains, as a moist and unstable airmass remains in
place across the Upper Midwest. Severe thunderstorms may develop
across parts of the region during the afternoon and evening, in
association with any shortwave trough that can translate through the
flow. The models suggest there is enough potential on Monday for a
more widespread severe threat, to add a 15 percent contour in parts
of the eastern Dakotas and Minnesota.

On Tuesday, an upper-level trough is forecast to move across the
northern Plains. Isolated strong to severe thunderstorms would be
possible ahead of the trough in parts of the upper Mississippi
Valley. As the trough moves through southeastern Canada on
Wednesday, severe storms would be possible in parts of the
Northeast. However, uncertainty is considerable at this range in the
forecast period.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1056 AM CDT Mon Jun 10 2024

Valid 101700Z - 111200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast remains on track. Please see the discussion
below for additional meteorological details. In addition, breezy
northwest winds around 15-25 mph will develop this afternoon in and
around the Sacramento and San Andres Mountains of NM via a localized
tight pressure gradient. However, cooler temperatures will only
yield minimum RH of 25-35 percent within these regions, precluding
the need for an Elevated area.

..Barnes.. 06/10/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0142 AM CDT Mon Jun 10 2024/

...Synopsis...
A weak midlevel ridge will favor continued warm/dry conditions
across much of the Southwest, where fuels continue to dry. While
these warm/dry conditions will support locally elevated fire-weather
conditions, a weak pressure gradient should limit sustained surface
winds and the overall fire-weather threat.

Farther north, moderate midlevel westerly flow on the backside of a
shortwave trough will cross the northern Cascades. As a result,
locally dry/breezy conditions are possible within the Cascade gaps
over central WA and northern OR -- potentially yielding locally
elevated fire-weather conditions.
