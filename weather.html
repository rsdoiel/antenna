Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0750 AM CDT Sun May 04 2025

Valid 041300Z - 051200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS EASTERN NEW
MEXICO AND FAR WEST TEXAS...

...SUMMARY...
Strong to potentially severe storms are expected across east-central
and southeast New Mexico and far west Texas this afternoon and
evening, with a threat for large hail, isolated severe wind gusts,
and possibly a tornado. Other strong to locally severe storms are
possible from Florida northward into the Mid-Atlantic and Allegheny
Plateau.

...New Mexico/West Texas...
In advance of the upper trough over the Southwest Deserts,
increasing height falls and strongly diffluent flow aloft will
overspread a modestly moist boundary layer with prevalent 40s to
near 50F surface dewpoints. Beneath steep mid-level lapse rates,
upwards of 500-1000 J/kg MLCAPE is expected by late afternoon.
Scattered thunderstorms are expected across northern into
east-central New Mexico, with more isolated storms expected into far
southeast New Mexico and west Texas. Wind profiles veering with
height and increasing mid-level southwesterly winds will provide
sufficient deep-layer shear for storm organization, including the
probable development of a few supercells. Large hail and localized
severe wind gusts will be possible. In addition, enlarging low-level
hodographs and gradually improving low-level moisture could support
a tornado or two if any mature supercells can persist through late
afternoon into the evening.

...Florida...
A cluster of storms across the north-central Peninsula, and to a
lesser extent across the south-central Peninsula, may pose a
localized severe risk as they continue eastward today. Existing
cloud cover may tend to somewhat mute more robust heating, but
gradual destabilization should still occur particularly along the
east coast, which will also probably influence storm development.
Effective shear of 25-30 kt will support potentially organized
storms capable of hail and isolated damaging gusts, and some tornado
threat may exist particularly in the vicinity of the sea breeze or
any other boundaries.

...Allegheny Plateau into the Carolinas...
East of the semi-stacked/closed low, cloud breaks and cold
temperatures aloft should support modest diurnal destabilization
across parts of Ohio and West Virginia into western Pennsylvania.
Storm development should be aided one or more low-amplitude
vorticity maxima rotating around the midlevel cyclone amidst
diffluent flow aloft. Low-level winds are expected to remain rather
weak, but modestly veering wind profiles and moderate mid-level flow
could support some storm organization, if sufficient buoyancy can be
realized. Hail and locally gusty winds could accompany the strongest
storms, and a corridor of higher severe probabilities (Slight Risk
caliber) may be warranted if a scenario with somewhat greater
destabilization appears likely.

Farther south into the Carolinas and parts of the Mid-Atlantic
region, somewhat stronger diurnal heating is expected, and MLCAPE
may increase to near/above 1000 J/kg. However, storm coverage is
more uncertain, with a notable mid-level dry slot and only weak to
modest large-scale ascent expected with southward extent. Any storms
that can mature within this environment could become modestly
organized with a threat of isolated hail and damaging gusts. 

...Eastern Idaho/southwest Montana...
Scattered storm development is expected this afternoon and evening
across eastern Idaho into southwest Montana, within an environment
characterized by cool temperatures aloft and steep lapse rates.
Deep-layer shear will be relatively modest, but a few stronger
storms with small hail and gusty winds could occur. Subsequent
outlooks will reevaluate the need for a potential introduction of
low-end severe probabilities.

Mesoscale Discussion 0677
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0547 AM CDT Sun May 04 2025

Areas affected...eastern North Carolina into far southeast Virginia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 041047Z - 041345Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated strong gusts, and perhaps a brief/weak tornado,
cannot be ruled out over eastern North Carolina and eventually into
far southeast Virginia.

DISCUSSION...A line of convection with wind shift continues to push
east, now completely out of SC and over eastern NC. Earlier, a 50 kt
gust was measured near North Myrtle Beach. 

In addition to the narrow north-south line of convection, other
storms have developed ahead of the line. These storms have shown
periodic weak mesocyclones. Other storms continue to show
near-severe inbound velocities mainly over the water, but this
activity may eventually move inland.

The air mass is marginally unstable, but sufficient for isolated
severe reports this morning. Low-level SRH with 0-1 km values of
100-150 m2/s2 will continue to favor rotation within the stronger
storms, though any tornado risk should remain low-end in nature.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0341 AM CDT Sun May 04 2025

Valid 071200Z - 121200Z

...DISCUSSION...
The upper-level low in the Southwest will begin to weaken on
Wednesday. Thereafter, it will make slow eastward progress before
becoming a weak cutoff low over the lower Mississippi Valley by the
weekend. This upper-level pattern will help push a surface boundary
along and offshore of the Gulf Coast. As the weekend progresses,
this boundary will move further offshore along with the weak upper
low. In the West and Plains, upper-level ridging will become
prominent and remain in place into the following week.

Some moderate mid-level winds will likely remain along the Gulf
Coast at least until this coming weekend. With some lingering
moisture in the coastal regions, its possible that areas of
localized severe risk will develop. However, the overall pattern
will not be favorable for any areas of organized/predictable severe
risk.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0209 AM CDT Sun May 04 2025

Valid 051200Z - 061200Z

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns are expected to shift into West Texas on
Monday as a dryline consolidates in tandem with a deepening surface
low through late afternoon. Lingering fire weather concerns are also
possible through the Red River Valley of the north and across parts
of southern New Mexico.

...West Texas...
The upper wave currently over southern CA will continue to shift
east over the next 48 hours, ejecting into the southern High Plains
by late Monday afternoon. Southwesterly winds increasing to 15-25
mph behind a sharpening dryline will advect dry air from northern
Mexico into West Texas. Relative humidity values falling into the
teens to low 20s are likely by peak heating when boundary-layer
mixing (and wind gust potential) will be maximized. Latest high-res
guidance suggests a corridor of elevated fire weather is likely with
localized critical conditions possible. ERC values between the 80th
to 90th percentile should support the fire weather concern. 

...New Mexico...
Breezy west/southwest winds are likely Monday afternoon as the
surface low consolidates to the east/southeast across West Texas. An
influx of slightly more moist air from the west and mid-level cloud
cover should limit diurnal heating and afternoon RH reductions to
some degree. Latest ensemble guidance suggests that the best
potential for sustained elevated fire weather conditions resides
along the I-25 corridor in southwest NM where downslope
warming/drying out of the Gila Region may promote locally
drier/windier conditions. Risk probabilities were withheld for this
outlook due to the weak ensemble signal/model dispersion and
potential for precipitation over the next 24 hours within this
corridor.

...Red River Valley of the North...
Southerly gradient wind are expected to persist through Monday
afternoon across much of eastern ND and northwest MN. With limited
moisture return expected through the next 48 hours, afternoon RH
minimums may fall into the low to mid 20s once again. Elevated
conditions are possible, though a weaker wind signal compared to
D1/Sunday, and the potential for a cold frontal passage late in the
afternoon, limit confidence in the overall fire threat. Trends will
continue to be monitored and highlights may be needed if guidance
trends towards stronger winds and/or a later cold front arrival.

Mesoscale Discussion 0670
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0306 PM CDT Sat May 03 2025

Areas affected...the Trans-Pecos in southwest Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 032006Z - 032230Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...An isolated supercell or two, capable of large hail, may
develop this afternoon. If storms form and intensify, the severe
threat should still be isolated, so a WW issuance is not expected.

DISCUSSION...Convection continues to deepen across the Trans-Pecos
region in southwest TX as warming surface temperatures beneath 7
C/km mid-level lapse rates contributes to 500+ J/kg MLCAPE. Despite
mid-level ridging, the overspreading of a 60-80 kt 300 mb jet stream
is resulting in 40+ kts of 0-6 km speed shear (per latest RAP
forecast soundings and mesoanalysis). This vertical shear profile,
along with the aforementioned buoyancy, is adequate in supporting
supercell storm modes capable of producing large hail with any
updrafts that can mature and sustain themselves. Given modest
instability and ascent, storm development should remain quite
isolated, along with any severe threat that manages to materialize.
Given the anticipated isolated severe threat, a WW issuance is
unlikely.

0316 PM CDT Sat May 03 2025

Valid 051200Z - 111200Z

As an upper-level low shifts eastward out of the Southwest on
D3/Monday, a surface low will deepen across western Texas/southern
New Mexico. Windy/dry conditions will overlap across portions of
central and southern New Mexico into western Texas behind the
dryline Monday afternoon. Light to locally moderate rainfall has
occurred over the last 24-48 hours across central New Mexico,
however, fuels in this region remain critically dry with dry/windy
conditions forecast on D2/Sunday. Some overlap of afternoon elevated
to locally critical wind and relative humidity appears likely again
Monday. A 40 percent delineation was added to cover this risk.

Further south and east, fuels in southeastern New Mexico have seen
more recent rainfall in the last 7-14 days, with ERCs in the 50th
percentile. Some additional rainfall is expected across this region
and into western Texas late D2/Sunday into D3/Monday, which will
likely mitigate the fire risk. Some localized Elevated concerns will
remain possible where less rainfall is received.

Beyond D3/Monday, some windy/dry conditions will continue across far
west Texas as southern stream westerly flow aloft continues. Heights
will rise across the southwest bringing lighter winds across the
areas where fuels remain the driest. This will keep fire concerns
low through much of the extended.

0252 PM CDT Sat May 03 2025

Valid 032000Z - 041200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE CAROLINAS INTO THE MID-ATLANTIC AND NEW ENGLAND...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong to severe thunderstorms are possible this afternoon
and evening from parts of the Carolinas into the Mid-Atlantic and
Northeast. A more isolated severe threat may develop across the
Southeast, and also across parts of the Great Basin and far west
Texas.

...20z update...
Minimal changes were made to the current forecast, mostly trimming
probabilities from the west. A broad corridor of severe potential
continues from southern New England to the Gulf Coast. Partial
diurnal heating east of the frontal zone is supporting a few
clusters of stronger storms from southern NY/New England and the Mid
Atlantic to the western Carolinas. 30-40 kt of bulk shear, in
combination with 500-1000 J/kg of MLCAPE will favor damaging winds
as the main threat with the multicell clusters or transient
supercells that develop as they spread northeastward through the
evening. Some sporadic hail and a brief tornado will also be
possible with any stronger rotating storms.

...AL and western GA...
Another corridor of locally stronger clusters may evolve across the
Gulf Coast, to central AL and into western GA later this afternoon
into the evening. Here, stronger diurnal heating (temps in the mid
to upper 70s F) amid enhanced mid-level flow from the sub tropical
jet may pose a locally greater severe risk for a few hours. A mix of
line segments and some supercell structures could pose a locally
greater severe risk. Some consideration was given to higher wind
probabilities here, but confidence in more robust convective
organization remains low, with lingering cloud cover, modest forcing
and limited buoyancy. Otherwise, the outlook remains unchanged, see
the previous discussion for more info.

..Lyons.. 05/03/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1128 AM CDT Sat May 03 2025/

...Carolinas into the Mid-Atlantic and New England...
Generally upper 50s to low 60s surface dewpoints are present
along/east of the higher terrain of the Blue Ridge/Appalachians from
parts of the Carolinas northeastward into the Mid-Atlantic and
southern New England. Even with mid-level lapse rates remaining
fairly modest, around 500-1000 J/kg of MLCAPE is forecast to develop
this afternoon in a narrow corridor across these regions with
additional filtered daytime heating. Large-scale ascent associated
with a slow-moving upper trough over the mid MS Valley will
gradually overspread the destabilizing warm sector in the next few
hours. This ascent, along with orographic lift over the higher
terrain, should aid in the development of scattered strong to severe
thunderstorms this afternoon and evening.

Around 30-40 kt of deep-layer shear should be present, which will
support a mix of multicells and marginal supercells. Scattered
damaging winds should be the main threat with the multiple clusters
that develop as they spread northeastward through the evening, but
some hail may also occur with any sustained supercell. Greater
confidence exists in overall thunderstorm coverage and intensity
across parts of the Mid-Atlantic into southern New England, where
the Slight Risk has been maintained with minimal changes. The
tornado threat remains less clear across these regions, but some
modest enhancement to the southwesterly low-level flow could aid in
occasional low-level updraft rotation.

...Southeast...
12Z soundings across the central Gulf Coast states show that
convection that occurred yesterday into the overnight/early morning
hours generally stabilized the environment this morning. Widespread
cloudiness evident in visible satellite imagery late this morning
should tend to delay/hinder robust destabilization this afternoon
along/ahead of the southeastward-advancing synoptic cold front,
which lends considerable uncertainty to the overall intensity of
renewed convection along/ahead of the front later today. Still,
mid-level winds and related deep-layer shear are forecast to
gradually strengthen through the afternoon/evening as the upper
trough over the mid MS/lower OH Valley develops slowly eastward.
This should support some threat for organized convection, and
isolated damaging winds may occur with any clusters that can form.
With continued concerns regarding the degree of instability
developing this afternoon, confidence remains too low to include
greater severe wind probabilities at this time.

...Great Basin...
Modestly enhanced southerly mid-level flow will overspread parts of
the western and northern Great Basin as an upper trough moves
eastward over the western CONUS through the afternoon/evening. While
boundary-layer moisture is expected to remain very limited,
increasing mid-level moisture and diurnal destabilization should aid
in weak MLCAPE developing by this afternoon. Scattered thunderstorms
are forecast to develop and spread northward, with an isolated
threat for severe winds given steepened low-level lapse rates and a
very well mixed boundary layer. Small hail may also occur with the
strongest cores.

...Far West Texas...
Even though large-scale ascent should remain weak/nebulous across
far west TX and vicinity today, isolated supercell development still
appears possible in a modest post-frontal/low-level upslope flow
regime. Both low-level winds and MLCAPE are expected to remain
modest, but strengthening westerly winds with height in mid/upper
levels should support around 30-40 kt of deep-layer shear and some
updraft organization. Based on latest guidance trends showing a
supercell or two developing this afternoon/evening, have introduced
a Marginal Risk for hail across parts of far west TX and vicinity.

Valid 051200Z - 061200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PORTIONS OF
WESTERN AND CENTRAL TEXAS...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are possible from the southern High Plains into
parts of central Texas Monday afternoon and evening. Large to very
large hail and severe winds are the primary threats. Additional
strong to severe storms are possible along the eastern Florida east
coast and from northeast North Carolina to the Lake Erie vicinity.

...Southern High Plains into central Texas...

The upper shortwave trough/low over the Southwest will pivot east to
the southern Rockies/High Plains on Monday. Enhanced southwesterly
deep-layer flow will overspread the region as this occurs. In the
low-levels, lee troughing will strengthen along the High Plains with
a small surface low forming over far west TX. Strengthening
southeasterly low-level flow will transport Gulf moisture northwest,
with upper 50s to mid 60s F dewpoints expected across the TX South
Plains and Permian Basin/Trans-Pecos region. More modest moisture
will extend northward into the TX/OK Panhandles and southeast CO to
the north of a warm front draped across north-central TX. 

Strong heating along the dryline extending along the TX/NM border
vicinity into the Big Bend is forecast. Cooling aloft will support
steep midlevel lapse rates and moderate instability is expected.
Supercell wind profiles, with curved low-level hodographs, becoming
elongated/straight above 2-3 km suggest large to very large hail
will be possible with initial convection. Additional storms are
likely to develop in the low-level warm advection regime along the
warm front, and as a low-level jet strengthens during the
evening/overnight. This may support upscale development with time,
and an MCS could form and track across central TX with an attendant
risk for damaging gusts. 

More isolated storms are expected within the modestly unstable, but
still strongly sheared environment with northward extent across the
OK/TX Panhandles into southeast CO. Hail and gust winds may occur
with this activity into Monday evening.

...North Carolina to Lake Erie...

The upper cyclone over KY early Monday will lift northeast toward
the upper Ohio Valley. Enhanced mid/upper flow will persist over the
region while cooling aloft supports modestly steep midlevel lapse
rates. At the surface, southeasterly low-level flow will support mid
50s to low 60s F dewpoints. Diurnal heating may be limited by
cloudiness and perhaps areas of morning showers. Nevertheless,
modest destabilization to less than 1000 J/kg MLCAPE appears
possible. Sufficient vertical shear will be present for some
cellular organization, and isolated hail and perhaps locally gusty
winds will be possible. 

...Florida...

Thunderstorms are expected to develop Monday afternoon in a
moderately unstable airmass (supported by mid 60s dewpoints and cool
temperatures aloft). Low to midlevel flow will remain weak on the
southern periphery of the upper cyclone over the Ohio Valley.
However, vertically veering profiles becoming northwesterly above
500 mb will support around 25 kt effective shear, and
elongated/straight hodographs. Isolated hail and gusty winds are
possible.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM THE FLORIDA
EAST COAST INTO SOUTHWEST PENNSYLVANIA...AND ACROSS EASTERN NEW
MEXICO...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated strong to severe thunderstorms are possible along the
Florida east coast into the North Carolina/Virginia Piedmont and
southwestern Pennsylvania. Additional severe thunderstorms are
possible across eastern New Mexico.

...Synopsis...

A mid/upper cyclone will remain positioned over the OH/TN Valley
vicinity on Sunday. This will maintain a belt of enhanced mid/upper
south to southwesterly flow from FL to the Upper OH Valley. Further
west, a large-scale upper trough will develop eastward across the
western states, while an upper low develops within the southern
branch of this system across the Southwest. As this occurs,
strengthening mid/upper south/southwesterly flow will overspread the
southern Rockies and adjacent High Plains. 

At the surface, a weak low is expected across WV with a cold front
extending south across the VA/NC Piedmont and the SC/GA coastal
vicinity before arcing southwest across north FL and the eastern
Gulf. Additionally, a sea breeze is expected to develop during the
late morning into afternoon along the FL east coast. Modest boundary
layer moisture from the upper 50s to mid 60s F (higher dewpoints
with southward extent) will be in place ahead of the front. Across
the southern Rockies/High Plains vicinity, lee troughing will
modestly strengthen during the afternoon/evening. Richer moisture
will remain well to the south, but dewpoints in the upper 40s to low
50s F are forecast.

...Florida...

Cool temperatures aloft (-12 to -14 C at 500 mb) will support steep
midlevel lapse rates near 7 C/km. Strong heating and low to mid 60s
F dewpoints beneath steep midlevel lapse rates will foster moderate
instability, with MLCAPE values topping out near 2000 J/kg. While
deep-layer flow will remain modest, effective shear near 25 kt and
vertically veering profiles will support at least transient storm
organization. Low-level convergence along the sea breeze and the
moderately unstable airmass should support isolated to scattered
robust updrafts. The strongest storms could produce marginally
severe hail and severe/damaging gusts. While low-level shear will
remain weak, sufficient moisture and 0-3 km MLCAPE amid small but
curved low-level hodographs suggests a brief tornado or two could
develop on the sea breeze boundary. Uncertainty regarding storm
coverage and longevity of strong updrafts precludes higher severe
probabilities at this time.

...Coastal GA/SC to southwest PA...

A modestly destabilizing airmass ahead of the surface cold front and
within the warm conveyor ahead of the upper low should support
thunderstorm development during the afternoon. Low-level flow will
remain light, but increase with height to around 50 kt at 500 mb,
supporting 25-35 kt effective shear across the region, and leading
to elongated/straight hodographs. Meanwhile, cool temperatures aloft
(-14 to -18 C at 500 mb) will support midlevel lapse rates of 6.5-7
C/km. Isolated to scattered thunderstorms may produce marginally
severe hail and gusty winds through early evening.

...New Mexico...

Despite meager boundary layer moisture, cool temperatures aloft will
support steep midlevel lapse rates and modest destabilization during
the afternoon/evening. Shortwave impulses ejecting through
increasing south/southwesterly mid/upper flow ahead of the Southwest
upper trough/low, and low-level upslope flow will allow for
scattered thunderstorm development by late afternoon into the
afternoon. Strong vertical shear should support at least a few
organized cells despite modest instability, and isolated hail and
strong gusts will be possible.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0101 AM CDT Sat May 03 2025/

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns are expected to remain limited across the
country for today. Dry conditions will prevail across the Southwest,
but weak low-level pressure gradient winds will limit the potential
for dry and windy conditions. Isolated to scattered thunderstorms
are expected from central NM westward across AZ and into central NV
this afternoon. Very dry boundary layer conditions sampled in 00 UTC
soundings may support occasional dry lightning strikes away from
slow-moving rain cores across western NM into central AZ. Similar
thermodynamic conditions and storm motions were observed yesterday
(Friday) and resulted in pockets of wetting rainfall as well as a
few dry lightning strikes. However, the coverage of dry lightning
over receptive fuels remains too limited to warrant a risk area
based on latest CAM guidance and fuel analyses.

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 212...215...

Valid 022044Z - 022215Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 212, 215
continues.

SUMMARY...The severe threat continues across Severe Thunderstorm
Watches 212 and 215. Large hail is the main threat, though damaging
gusts and a tornado remain possible.

DISCUSSION...Multiple rounds of strong to severe thunderstorms are
underway, and are expected to persist through the remainder of the
afternoon across southern into central and eastern TX. Ahead of the
cold front, quasi-linear multicellular convection persists across
central TX, where marginal severe hail has been reported. Surface
temperatures ahead of these storms are in the 80s F, with low 70s F
dewpoints, supporting 1500-2000 J/kg MLCAPE and a continued marginal
severe hail threat. 

To the south of the central TX storms, supercells continue to
fluctuate in strength along a baroclinic boundary. These storms have
produced occasional instances of marginal severe hail and brief
bouts of low-level rotation. Given ample buoyancy with these storms,
periodic occurrences of large hail and low-level rotation should
continue through the afternoon. Once storms to the north encounter
the ongoing supercells, a few severe gusts could occur given cold
pool mergers. 

Perhaps the greatest threat for severe storms may materialize east
of the Big Bend, over the Edwards Plateau. Here, undisturbed
insolation has persisted the longest, resulting in over 4000 J/kg
MLCAPE amid 45 kts of effective bulk shear. Supercells that develop
in this environment could pose the greatest risk for 2+ inch
diameter hail and perhaps a tornado, as also suggested by some of
the latest Warn-on-Forecast output.

Mesoscale Discussion 0655
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0322 PM CDT Fri May 02 2025

Areas affected...eastern KY/TN and far southwest OH

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 213...

Valid 022022Z - 022215Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 213
continues.

SUMMARY...A mixed threat of isolated severe hail and damaging gusts
should persist through early evening with scattered to broken
thunderstorms from the central Ohio Valley to the Cumberland
Plateau.

DISCUSSION...A fairly messy convective evolution persists, which has
likely mitigated a more widespread damaging wind threat so far this
afternoon. The northern end of the convective swath across KY has
broken up into more cellular elements, with the far northern portion
that moved through the Louisville area producing damaging winds.
Meanwhile farther south in TN, the convective line has failed to
appreciably organize. This may be related to the weak lower-level
flow sampled in area VWP data. Primary severe threat may remain from
sporadic, marginally severe hail. Any one of these stronger cores
might aid in localized damaging wind swaths downstream, but
confidence is low in if/where a more concentrated threat will occur.

Mesoscale Discussion 0654
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0303 PM CDT Fri May 02 2025

Areas affected...north AL...far northwest GA...far southeast TN

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 209...213...214...

Valid 022003Z - 022200Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 209, 213,
214 continues.

SUMMARY...A mix of marginal severe hail and strong to isolated
severe gusts is expected to persist across mainly northern Alabama
through early evening.

DISCUSSION...Yet another line segment has consolidated, this time
along the MS/AL border area, generally on the southern periphery of
the scattered convective swaths over the Deep South and TN Valley.
With low to mid 80s surface temperatures ahead of this line at peak
mixing of the boundary layer, potential for strong to severe gusts
(55-70 mph) should mainly spread across north AL through early
evening. Recent surface observations from KHSV and KCBM have
measured 48 kt gusts. Small to marginally severe hail cores will
remain embedded within the line and in additional cells that can
redevelop atop the large-scale convective outflows, across far north
AL and north GA. Areas farther north-northwest in middle TN appear
to be well stabilized.

Mesoscale Discussion 0634
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0322 PM CDT Thu May 01 2025

Areas affected...western MD/eastern WV Panhandles into south-central
PA

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 012022Z - 012145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...A single, slow-moving supercell may persist for the next
couple hours with a threat of large hail and localized damaging
winds. Confidence is low in greater coverage/longevity for a
potential severe thunderstorm watch.

DISCUSSION...A supercell centered on Allegany County, MD has had the
most impressive observational structure per radar/satellite trends,
relative to other severe storms in the Upper OH Valley/Lower Great
Lakes region. This cell appears to be anchored near a slow-moving
warm front, likely ingesting a mesoscale ribbon of mid 60s surface
dew points southeastward along the WV/VA/MD border area. Given the
relatively confined region of this enhancement, with a substantially
drier air mass both to the northeast and south, the longevity of a
sustained supercell structure is questionable. However, it is
plausible that a localized severe hail/wind threat may continue for
the next couple hours.

Mesoscale Discussion 0623
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0307 PM CDT Wed Apr 30 2025

Areas affected...Eastern Kentucky

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 302007Z - 302200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated damaging winds and potentially marginally severe
hail may occur with the strongest storms. A watch is not likely this
afternoon.

DISCUSSION...A very moist airmass (mid/upper 60s F dewpoints) is in
place in the Upper Ohio Valley vicinity. On the southern fringe of a
belt of stronger mid-level flow, effective shear is a modest 25-30
kts. Around 1500 J/kg MLCAPE will promote a few stronger to
marginally severe storms. Low-level lapse rates are steep and
damaging winds are the primary threat. Mid-level lapse rates
(sampled by this mornings soundings) are modest. Small to perhaps
isolated, marginally severe hail may occur with the strongest
storms.

Mesoscale Discussion 0622
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0253 PM CDT Wed Apr 30 2025

Areas affected...western and central Arkansas

Concerning...Tornado Watch 197...

Valid 301953Z - 302200Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 197 continues.

SUMMARY...A line of strong to severe storms will continue eastward
the next several hours. Damaging gusts and a tornado or two remain
possible. A downstream watch will likely be needed.

DISCUSSION...The line of convection across western AR will continue
to shift east at around 35 kt the next few hours. downstream,
filtered heating has allowed temperatures to warm into the low/mid
80s amid low/mid 60s F dewpoints. Midlevel lapse rates remain
modest, but the moist environment is fostering modest instability
amid a moderately sheared environment. Given stronger heating ahead
of the line, low-level lapse rates have steepened considerable, and
this may foster a continued risk for damaging gusts into early
evening. A new watch downstream from Tornado Watch 197 will likely
be needed in the next hour.

Mesoscale Discussion 0621
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0240 PM CDT Wed Apr 30 2025

Areas affected...East-central Missouri into southern Illinois

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 301940Z - 302145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...A few storms are possible along an outflow boundary. All
severe hazards would be possible. A watch is uncertain in the short
term, but issuance is possible this afternoon depending on
observational trends.

DISCUSSION...Airmass modification after earlier convection has been
evident over the past couple of hours in central Missouri and
southern Illinois. The primary outflow boundary is situated just
south of St. Louis and extends into far southern Illinois and
southern Indiana. Dewpoints south of the boundary have increased to
upper 60s F except for parts of southeastern Missouri which has only
recovered into the low 60s F. North of the outflow boundary, stable
billow clouds remain. However, very near the boundary temperatures
and dewpoints have increased and at least some MLCIN has been
removed and convection has begun to slowly deepen.

With 40 kts of effective shear (more favorably oriented across the
boundary on its western half), supercells would be expected if
storms develop. Large hail and damaging winds would be possible. A
tornado or two would also be possible for storms interacting with
the more backed easterly/southeasterly winds on the cooler side of
the boundary. Being in the wake of an earlier MCV, forcing for
ascent will be nebulous and will depend on heating/destabilization
along the outflow. Trends will continue to be monitored. A watch is
possible this afternoon.

  A few tornadoes likely with a couple intense tornadoes possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph likely
  Scattered large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...A line of thunderstorms over southern Oklahoma and north
Texas will track eastward today across the watch area.  Locally
damaging wind gusts are possible along the line along with brief
tornadoes.  Other severe storms capable of tornadoes may form ahead
of the line by early afternoon.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 80 statute miles
east and west of a line from 40 miles east northeast of Poteau OK to
85 miles south of Paris TX. For a complete depiction of the watch
see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU7).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 1.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 60 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean
storm motion vector 24030.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 196
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1255 AM CDT Wed Apr 30 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Southwest and South-Central Oklahoma
  Northwest and North-Central Texas

* Effective this Wednesday morning from 1255 AM until 800 AM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2
    inches in diameter likely
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph likely
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Strong to severe thunderstorms are expected to persist
throughout the night in the vicinity of an outflow boundary that
extends across the region. Hail will be the primary risk with this
more cellular development. There is also some potential for the
storms in west TX to evolve into an organized line segment that
could progress across the region later. Damaging gusts would be the
primary risk with this more linear activity.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 50
statute miles north and south of a line from 50 miles south
southwest of Altus OK to 30 miles south southeast of Mcalester OK.
For a complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch
outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU6).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

Mesoscale Discussion 0608
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0355 PM CDT Tue Apr 29 2025

Areas affected...Portions of South Plains into western North Texas

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 190...

Valid 292055Z - 292230Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 190
continues.

SUMMARY...A localized corridor of tornado potential may develop over
the next few hours. Storms will need to root along/east of the
surface boundary for this potential to be realized.

DISCUSSION...A cluster of supercells, some of which have produced
greater than 2 inch hail, are generally rooted just on the cool side
of the surface cold front. If storms can remain discrete and track
with a more eastward motion, warm/moist easterly surface winds are
in the warm sector. Greater tornado potential would exist should
that scenario occur. Given at least a modest increase in low-level
flow this evening, it is possible the boundary moves slightly
northwestward. Trends will be monitored.

Mesoscale Discussion 0607

0335 PM CDT Tue Apr 29 2025

Areas affected...Parts of eastern Oklahoma into Northwest Arkansas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 292035Z - 292230Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Storms that are currently elevated may produce marginally
severe hail. A watch is not anticipated in the short term, but
trends will be monitored.

DISCUSSION...Storms in central Oklahoma have remained elevated and
sub-severe so far. The observed 18Z Norman sounding showed modestly
steep mid-level lapse rates, but relatively weak buoyancy due to
cloud cover/precipitation. This activity will generally move to the
east/northeast behind an outflow boundary. Recent surface
observations have shown some airmass modification/recovery in
east-central Oklahoma where temperatures have warmed back into the
low 70s. There is at least low potential that storms nearest to the
outflow boundary could become near to surface based. A locally
greater severe threat would be possible in that scenario. Overall,
however, storms will primarily be capable of marginally severe hail
and perhaps isolated damaging gusts.

Mesoscale Discussion 0606
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0327 PM CDT Tue Apr 29 2025

Areas affected...southern IL/IN into southwest OH.

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 188...189...

Valid 292027Z - 292230Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 188, 189
continues.

SUMMARY...Strong to severe thunderstorms producing damaging wind
gusts will move from southern Illinois into southern Indiana the
next 1-2 hours. Additional severe risk may redevelop into southwest
Ohio this evening.

DISCUSSION...A mature MCS continues to move from southern IL into
southern IN this afternoon. This activity has sporadically produced
damaging gusts and isolated hail over the last couple of hours, with
a couple areas of line-embedded rotation also noted. These storms
should maintain intensity as it moves east across a moderately
unstable airmass with steepening low-level lapse rates continuing to
support damaging wind potential across Severe Thunderstorm Watch
189. 

By evening, this MCS is expected to approach southwest OH and Severe
Thunderstorm Watch 188. The airmass across this area has shown signs
of recovery from a midday cluster of severe storms now approaching
western PA. Temperatures have rebounded into the mid/upper 70s with
dewpoints in the mid/upper 60s. This area could support a continued
severe risk into this evening. As such, watch clearance has not been
recommended as redevelopment of new convection is possible.
Likewise, the cluster moving into southern IN also may approach this
area in the next 2-3 hours.

Mesoscale Discussion 0599
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0552 AM CDT Tue Apr 29 2025

Areas affected...central into northeast Oklahoma...far southeast
Kansas

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 186...

Valid 291052Z - 291345Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 186
continues.

SUMMARY...Locally severe gusts remain possible from central into
northeast Oklahoma.

DISCUSSION...The leading edge of a small MCS which moved out of
northwest TX and pivoted into southwest OK continues to produce
measured severe gusts, most recently in Grady County as of 1030Z.
North of this area, storms have gradually increased along the cold
front extending from southeast KS into north-central OK. This line
of storms is also beginning to produce outflow as well.

An unstable air mass remains ahead of both convective systems, and
it appears these storms will merge from central into northeast OK.
Damaging gusts will remain the most likely threat, although hail of
1.00+" is likely in the stronger storm cores.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 186
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
235 AM CDT Tue Apr 29 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Far Northwest Arkansas
  South-Central/Southeast Kansas
  Far Southwest Missouri
  Northern Oklahoma
  Far Northeast Texas Panhandle

* Effective this Tuesday morning from 235 AM until 1000 AM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2
    inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms are expected to develop across northwest OK
and the far northeast TX Panhandle in the vicinity of a cold front
progressing southward. This initial activity could pose a threat for
large hail. This development will likely grow upscale with an
attendant threat for damaging gusts as it moves eastward across
northern OK and south-central/southeast KS into far southwest MO and
far northwest AR. Some hail is possible within the stronger cells
across these areas as well.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 60
statute miles north and south of a line from 95 miles west southwest
of Alva OK to 20 miles east northeast of Joplin MO. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU6).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to

PUBLIC SEVERE WEATHER OUTLOOK  
NWS STORM PREDICTION CENTER NORMAN OK
0852 PM CDT MON APR 28 2025

...Severe thunderstorms expected over parts of the Upper Midwest
this evening and overnight...

* LOCATIONS...
  Wisconsin
  Northern Iowa
  Far Southeast Minnesota

* HAZARDS...
  Several tornadoes, a few intense
  Scattered large hail, some baseball size
  Scattered damaging winds

* SUMMARY...
  Multiple corridors of severe thunderstorms will continue this
  evening from the Upper Midwest into the central and southern
  Plains. Tornadoes, large hail, and severe gusts all remain
  possible, including some potential for strong tornadoes.

Preparedness actions...

Tornadoes at night can be particularly dangerous because they 
are usually fast-moving and difficult to see. Stay tuned to
NOAA Weather Radio, weather.gov, or other media for watches and
warnings. A tornado watch means that conditions are favorable
for tornadoes to form during the next several hours. If a tornado
warning is issued for your area, move to a place of safety,
ideally in a basement or interior room on the lowest floor of a
sturdy building.

Mesoscale Discussion 0588
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0333 PM CDT Mon Apr 28 2025

Areas affected...Edwards Plateau into western/central Oklahoma

Concerning...Severe potential...Tornado Watch likely 

Valid 282033Z - 282300Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...A tornado watch will likely be needed this afternoon as
storms are expected to develop along the dryline in the next 2-3
hours. All severe hazards will be possible. The tornado threat will
steadily increase from late afternoon into the evening.

DISCUSSION...Signs of mid-level ascent have been evident across the
southern Plains with visible satellite showing increasing amounts of
mid/high-level clouds moving in from the southwest. As a shortwave
perturbation lifts northeastward this afternoon/evening, this ascent
and additional surface heating should erode capping along/near the
dryline. A high-based storm has already formed northeast of Fort
Stockton in the last hour. Additional storms are expected to develop
later this afternoon, perhaps within the next 2-3 hours.

The environment will be quite favorable for supercells capable of
all severe hazards. Very steep mid-level lapse rates were observed
within the High Plains region on this mornings soundings. Large to
potentially giant hail will be possible along with severe winds.
Tornadoes will also be possible, particularly from southwest
Oklahoma into the Texas Rolling Plains where dewpoints have remained
in the upper 60s/low 70s F. The tornado threat will steadily
increase with time as 850 mb winds increase east of the dryline from
late afternoon into the evening. A strong tornado cannot be ruled
out within this more favorable mesoscale zone.

Mesoscale Discussion 0587
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0328 PM CDT Mon Apr 28 2025

Areas affected...far southeast NE...southwest into central
IA...northwest MO...northeast KS

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 282028Z - 282300Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...Widely scattered thunderstorms will pose a risk for a few
tornadoes (a couple strong), large to very large hail (up to 3 inch
diameter), and isolated damaging gusts through evening. A tornado
watch will likely be needed for portions of the discussion area from
central Iowa into northeast Kansas.

DISCUSSION...Deepening cumulus is noted along a dryline from eastern
NE/northwest IA southward into northeast KS. An 18z RAOB from OAX
indicated an EML around 700 mb, but only weak capping remained.
Additional heating into the low/mid 80s F amid mid/upper 60s F
dewpoints beneath steep midlevel lapse rates around 7.5-8.5 C/km 
immediately downstream from the surface dryline is support strong
instability with MLCAPE greater than 2000 J/kg noted in latest SPC
Mesoanalysis and the 18z OAX RAOB. In addition to this this
favorable thermodynamic environment, vertical shear is very
favorable for supercell thunderstorms, as evident in enlarged,
looping low-level hodographs becoming somewhat elongated above 2-3
km. 

Large-scale ascent will remain somewhat weaker with southward extent
into the MO Valley vicinity, and storm coverage is a bit uncertain,
especially with southward extent. Timing of convective initiation is
also uncertain, but seems most likely in the 22-00z time frame.
Regardless, any storms developing in this environment will likely
have robust updrafts and become intense, posing a risk for very
large hail, a few tornadoes and damaging gusts. A tornado watch will
likely be needed for portions of the MCD area in the next 1-2 hours.

Mesoscale Discussion 0586
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0225 PM CDT Mon Apr 28 2025

Areas affected...central/southeast MN...western WI...northern IA

Concerning...Severe potential...Tornado Watch likely 

Valid 281925Z - 282130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...Severe thunderstorm potential will increase through late
afternoon. All severe hazards, including tornadoes (some strong),
very large hail (to 3 inch diameter) and damaging gusts (to 70 mph)
are possible.

DISCUSSION...A line of convection along a surface front across
southwest MN into northwest IA will continue to shift east/northeast
this afternoon. Ahead of this convection, the downstream airmass
across central/southeast MN, northern IA and western WI continues to
moisten and destabilize. Surface dewpoints have increased into the
low to mid 60s as far north as the Minneapolis metro area, with
upper 50s to near 60 F to the north and east. Continued northward
moisture transport on a 50+ kt low level jet should continue to aid
in further destabilization over the next few hours as large-scale
ascent overspreads the region. 

Region VWP data from KMPX/KDMX/KARX already show impressive vertical
shear favorable for supercells. Enlarged, curved low-level
hodographs amid the strengthening low-level jet is aiding in 0-1 km
SRH greater than 250 m2/s2. As weak MLCIN continues to erode,
convection moving into this environment is likely to become better
organized, with an increase in storm coverage expected into northern
IA. Intense convection is expected to move across the MCD from late
this afternoon into this evening, posing an all-hazards severe risk.
A tornado watch will likely be needed in the next 1-2 hours.

Day 3 Convective Outlook CORR 1
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0317 AM CDT Mon Apr 28 2025

Valid 301200Z - 011200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS PORTIONS OF
NORTH-CENTRAL TEXAS INTO SOUTHERN OKLAHOMA...

CORRECTED FOR INCORRECT DAY REFERENCE

...SUMMARY...
Widely scattered thunderstorm activity is expected from the southern
Plains to the Great Lakes on Wednesday as a mid-level trough ejects
into the southern Plains. Severe thunderstorms will be possible
across east-central Texas into central/eastern Oklahoma.

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will eject across the southern Plains on Tuesday.
Surface low development is expected across western Texas on
D2-Tuesday, with a weak low tracking eastward into east-central
Texas by the D3-Wednesday period. Overnight thunderstorm activity is
expected at the beginning of the D3 period across portions of
central Oklahoma into east-central Texas. By the afternoon,
additional scattered thunderstorm development along the dryline near
the Red River on Wednesday afternoon will pose potential for severe
wind, hail, and a tornado.

...East-Central Texas into southern Oklahoma...
Scattered thunderstorm development along the dryline across central
Texas into Oklahoma on Wednesday afternoon will pose some severe
potential. Some uncertainty arises in coverage of morning convection
and cloud cover. However, it appears a corridor of favorable
instability and shear will overlap by the afternoon along and ahead
of the dryline. Shear profiles will be supportive of supercells
before clusters begin to form and attempts at upscale growth occur.
Large hail and damaging wind will be the primary risks given steep
lapse rates, though forecast soundings do show some curvature of low
level hodographs favorable for some tornado risk with early
supercell modes.

Mesoscale Discussion 0577
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0349 PM CDT Sun Apr 27 2025

Areas affected...parts of nw TX into the TX Pnhdl

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 272049Z - 272245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Probabilities for thunderstorm development appear low, but
may not be negligible late this afternoon into early evening, with
the environment conditionally supportive of supercells posing a risk
for large hail and tornadoes.  If and when it becomes more certain
that storms will form, a severe weather watch will probably be
needed.

DISCUSSION...Boundary-layer moisture characterized by lower/mid 60s
surface dew points is being maintained across the Lubbock through
Amarillo vicinities, beneath a deep warm elevated mixed-layer based
between 850-700 mb, just east of a dryline which may mix only slowly
northeastward/eastward into early evening.  This appears to be
contributing to strong potential instability (3000+ J/kg), beneath
moderate to strong southwesterly mid/upper flow (including 40-70+ kt
in the 500-300 mb layer), and an environment conditionally
supportive of intense supercells.

Perhaps due to the warm/dry air at mid-levels, and weak large-scale
forcing for ascent, convection allowing guidance, in particular,
continues to indicate generally low potential for thunderstorm
initiation through early evening.  However, at least attempts at
deepening convective development are evident to the west of the
dryline, and objective analysis indicates a possible secondary
maximum in dryline convergence developing near/north of Lubbock
toward areas west of Amarillo.   

Of particular concern, if a sustained storm does develop during the
next couple of hours, there appears potential for rapid
intensification while propagating across the dryline.  Toward
23-00Z, strengthening south-southeasterly low-level flow (in excess
of 30 kt around 850 mb) may contribute to enlarging clockwise curved
low-level hodographs increasingly supportive of potential for
tornadoes, in addition to large, potentially damaging hail.

Mesoscale Discussion 0576
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0347 PM CDT Sun Apr 27 2025

Areas affected...Western Kansas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 272047Z - 272245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Watch issuance in western Kansas is currently unlikely.
Significant severe would be possible if storms develop.
Observational trends will be monitored.

DISCUSSION...Periodic enhancement to the cumulus field in western
Kansas has been noted in day cloud phase satellite imagery,
primarily in the vicinity of Goodland. Low 60s F dewpoints ahead of
the surface trough/modest dryline has allowed around 2500 J/kg
MLCAPE to develop. With the generally weak dryline circulation and
uncertain/subtle mid-level ascent, the development of deep
convection is far from a given. Only the more aggressive of the CAM
models suggests development later this afternoon. However, despite
this uncertainty, the environment will be conditionally favorable
for significant severe if storms can form. Supercells would be
likely given 40-45 kts of effective shear perpendicular to the
dryline. Furthermore, a strong increase in 850 mb winds after 00Z
would support a tornado threat.

Watch issuance appears unlikely at this time, but observational
trends (including observed sounding data) will be monitored over the
next few hours.

Areas affected...2Nebraska Panhandle into the Sandhills and
Southwest Nebraska

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 272029Z - 272230Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated to widely scattered supercell potential should
increase over the next 2-3 hours. Large/very-large hail and severe
gusts will be possible. The tornado threat will initially be low,
but will increase for storms persisting near/after sunset. Trends
will be monitored for watch issuance.

DISCUSSION...As the lee trough continues to deepen this afternoon,
clusters of cumulus clouds have begun to develop in northeast
Colorado. With time and the approach of a shortwave trough, a
surface low will become more evident in eastern Colorado. Low 60s F
dewpoints have already reached parts of northwest Kansas and should
continue north and west as low-level winds respond to the surface
cyclone.

Effective shear of around 45 kts across the trough axis will promote
discrete storm development. Steep mid-level lapse rates and
initially long, straight hodographs will promote a risk for
large/very-large hail and severe winds. As the low-level jet
increases this evening, any mature supercells ongoing will have an
increased potential to produce a tornado. Storm coverage is somewhat
uncertain, but isolated to widely scattered supercells appear
possible given at least modest mid-level ascent expected over the
next few hours.

Mesoscale Discussion 0574
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0255 PM CDT Sun Apr 27 2025

Areas affected...,parts of swrn TX

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 271955Z - 272100Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...The initiation of a couple of storms appears increasingly
likely near and northwest through north of Fort Stockton through 4-5
PM CDT.  More rapid thunderstorm intensification accompanied by
increasing potential for large hail and locally damaging wind gusts
may be initially slow, before probably increasing toward early
evening around the Midland through Big Spring vicinities.

DISCUSSION...The boundary-layer is becoming strongly heated and
deeply mixed across the Davis Mountains vicinity of southwest Texas
into the Texas South Plains.  The dryline is sharpening east through
north of Fort Stockton, where 2-hourly surface pressure falls around
2.0+ mb have been observed the past couple of hours, and low-level
convergence appears strongest.

Deepening convective development is ongoing within the deeper
mixed-boundary layer around Fort Stockton, where surface
temperature/dew point spreads are around 50 F (95/44), but forecast
soundings and HREF guidance suggests that the initiation of at least
isolated thunderstorm development is increasingly probable through
21-22Z.  It appears that this may be aided by forcing associated
with a mid-level speed maximum within southwesterly flow emanating
from the northern Mexican Plateau.

Downstream of slow moving large-scale mid-level troughing over the
southern Great Basin and Southwest, after at least some further
eastward mixing of the dryline late this afternoon, it probably will
begin to retreat northwest across the Pecos Valley vicinity toward
23-00Z.  As this occurs, convection may acquire more substantively
unstable updraft inflow (including most unstable CAPE up to
2000-3000+ J/kg), supporting increasing potential for rapid
thunderstorm intensification, in the presence of strong deep-layer
shear.  This may including a splitting supercell or two, posing a
risk for large hail and a few strong surface gusts.

Until then, though, initial thunderstorm development will probably
be more modest in strength, but could still pose some risk for
producing severe hail and wind.
