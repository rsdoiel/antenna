Mesoscale Discussion 0883
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0338 PM CDT Mon May 19 2025

Areas affected...parts of east central and northeastern Oklahoma

Concerning...Tornado Watch 292...

Valid 192038Z - 192245Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 292 continues.

SUMMARY...Long-lived discrete supercell development accompanied by
potential for a couple of strong tornadoes remains possible, while
spreading across the I-40 into I-44 corridors of northeastern
Oklahoma through 5-7 PM CDT.

DISCUSSION...A clustering of strong to severe storms, including a
couple of sustained tornado producing supercells continues to
develop north/northeastward, within a seasonably moist and
moderately unstable warm sector, well east of the dryline.  This has
been supported by a weak lead mid-level perturbation progressing
toward the Ozark Plateau.

The supercells are generally focused along/west of a strengthening
(40+ kt) 850 mb jet axis, and now within an area of stronger surface
pressure falls (including 2-3+ mb/2 hourly, evident in 20Z surface
observations).  As long as the supercells remain more or less
discrete, the environment remains conducive to additional tornado
development, with perhaps some increase in potential for a strong
tornado or two into early evening.

Mesoscale Discussion 0882

0331 PM CDT Mon May 19 2025

Areas affected...Southern Iowa into northeast Missouri

Concerning...Severe potential...Severe Thunderstorm Watch likely 

Valid 192031Z - 192200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms moving out of northern Missouri will pose a
severe hail risk for parts of southern Iowa and northeast Missouri
over the next few hours. Watch issuance is expected.

DISCUSSION...Elevated convection continues to rapidly develop
northward across northern Missouri and is spreading into
south-central Iowa within a zone of strong warm air advection
between 925-850 mb. Despite being elevated in nature, MUCAPE and
effective shear downstream across IA and northeast MO remains very
favorable for organized convection (MUCAPE 1500-2000 J/kg and 45-55
knots respectively). Storm mode will likely remain a mix of
supercells and clusters, but intense updrafts will be capable of
producing severe hail, most likely between 1 to 2 inches diameter. A
severe thunderstorm watch will be needed soon to address this
threat.

Mesoscale Discussion 0881
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0312 PM CDT Mon May 19 2025

Areas affected...Southeast Nebraska to northeast Kansas

Concerning...Tornado Watch 293...294...

Valid 192012Z - 192215Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 293, 294 continues.

SUMMARY...The threat for large hail, severe wind, and tornadoes
continues across southeast Nebraska into northeast Kansas, though a
couple of localized corridors of higher tornado potential are
becoming apparent.

DISCUSSION...Convection developing along a cold front/confluence
axis across southeast NE continues to intensify, and a few cells
have begun to show signs of persistent mid-level rotation based on
KUEX velocity imagery. Additional cells continue to develop along
the boundary, so storm coverage is expected to increase over the
next 1-2 hours.  Ambient vorticity along the strongly confluent
boundary coupled with strong, organizing updrafts deepening atop the
boundary should support a tornado threat for the next few hours,
though tornado strength/longevity may be modulated by destructive
storm interactions. Regardless, a large hail threat will continue
with 1 inch hail recently reported. 

Further southeast into northeast KS, deep convection is developing
along the dryline per GOES imagery and latest lightning data.
Modifying an 18 UTC OAX sounding based on warm sector observations
suggests that sufficient buoyancy and low-level helicity is in place
to support STP values up to 2 downstream of the developing storms.
Strong cross-boundary flow should promote supercellular storm modes
with a strong tornado and very large hail threat for the next couple
of hours along the KS/NE border.

Mesoscale Discussion 0880
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0234 PM CDT Mon May 19 2025

Areas affected...Northeast Arkansas and adjacent portions of
Mississippi...Tennessee...and Missouri

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 191934Z - 192130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated convection developing across northeast
Arkansas/parts of the mid-Mississippi River Valley may sufficiently
intensify to pose a hail/wind threat through late afternoon.
Coverage of strong/severe storms should remain too limited for watch
issuance.

DISCUSSION...Over the past hour, shallow convection has percolated
across northeast AR as temperatures warm into the mid 80s amid low
to mid 70 dewpoints. Within the last 15 minutes, GOES IR imagery
shows a few deeper towers developing, suggesting that this
convection is beginning to overcome lingering MLCIN and fully
realizing the high-buoyancy environment (MLCAPE estimated between
2500-3000 J/kg). 30-40 knot flow between 5-6 km sampled by regional
VWPs is supporting bulk shear values around 30 knots, which should
be sufficient to support a few stronger/severe cells through late
afternoon. Large hail should be the primary concern with
deeper/stronger cells, though numerous storms in close proximity may
promote destructive storm interactions and/or some degree of
clustering with an more pronounced damaging wind threat. In general,
severe storm coverage should remain sufficiently limited due to weak
forcing for ascent to preclude watch issuance at this time (though a
more robust/widespread severe threat is expected to emerge later
tonight).

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0322 PM CDT Mon May 19 2025

Valid 211200Z - 271200Z

Mainly zonal mid-level flow through the middle of the week will give
way to upper ridging in the Plains as mid-level troughs deepen
across the western and eastern U.S. by the end of the week. By the
weekend into early next week, the western mid-level trough will
de-amplify while progressing toward the Plains. Surface high
pressure will build across the central and northern U.S. through the
week, while a surface low will encourage the northward return of
moisture across the southern Plains by the end of the week toward
the weekend. Overall quiescent fire weather conditions are expected
through most of the extended range. The largest concern for future
significant wildfire-spread potential remains across portions of the
Southwest, where prolonged warm and dry conditions will support the
continued curing of fuels. Disagreement remains among medium-range
guidance members in terms of the evolution of the de-amplifying
western upper trough by the weekend. Stronger surface winds may
develop over parts of the Southwest by the weekend, but confidence
in this scenario is too low for the introduction of Critical
probabilities at this time.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0252 PM CDT Mon May 19 2025

Valid 192000Z - 201200Z

...THERE IS A MODERATE RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS FAR NORTH
TEXAS...MUCH OF CENTRAL AND EASTERN OKLAHOMA...SOUTHEAST
KANSAS...NORTHWEST ARKANSAS...AND SOUTHWEST MISSOURI...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM EAST
TENNESSEE INTO WESTERN SOUTH CAROLINA...

...SUMMARY...
Significant severe weather is likely from the central/southern
Plains into the the Ozarks today into tonight. All severe weather
hazards are expected, to include tornadoes (some potentially strong
to intense), very large hail, and severe winds.

...20Z Update...
A regional outbreak of severe thunderstorms is still anticipated
this afternoon and evening as a shortwave trough ejecting from the
central/southern High Plains into the central/southern Plains, where
a very moist and unstable airmass is in place. Recent surface
analysis shows low 70s dewpoints across much of central and eastern
OK, with mid 60s dewpoints as far north as southeast NE. Both the
18Z OUN and OAX soundings sampled cold mid-level temperatures and
associated steep mid-level lapse rates. Ample moisture beneath these
steep lapse rates is supporting very strong buoyancy. 18Z OUN
sounding reported MLCAPE over 3500 J/kg. 

Storms that developed earlier this afternoon across central OK are
now moving into southeast KS. These storms have maintained their
elevated character thus far, but some transition to a more
surface-based character is possible as destabilization continues
downstream. More surface-based, cellular development has initiated
across south-central OK and adjacent far northeast OK. Airmass
downstream is favorable for storm maintenance as they track
east-northeastward. All severe hazards are possible with these
storms, including very large hail, strong wind gusts, and strong to
intense tornadoes.  

Convergence along the dryline is modest now, but will likely
increase later this afternoon and evening. Expectation is for
another round of supercells capable of all hazards (i.e. very large
hail, strong wind gusts, and strong to intense tornadoes) moving
from southwest OK/far northwest TX into central/south-central OK and
adjacent north-central TX.  Large-scale ascent will increase across
eastern KS and southeast NE as well, with thunderstorms capable of
all hazards expected across this region as well.

By this evening, there will likely be a nearly continuous line of
thunderstorms from southeast NE/southwest IA into north-central TX.
A mix of supercells and bowing segments will maintain the risk of
significant severe weather throughout the evening and tonight,
continuing into early tomorrow morning from the Mid-MS Valley into
the Arklatex.

Guidance has trended towards more favorable environmental conditions
for a greater severe risk across southeast MO tonight, Wind and
tornado probabilities were increased across this region as a result.

..Mosier.. 05/19/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1130 AM CDT Mon May 19 2025/

A powerful upper trough over the southern Rockies will eject into
the Plains today, with an associated 70-80 knot mid level jet nosing
into OK.  Meanwhile, the primary surface low will deepen over
northwest OK and a southerly low-level jet will strengthen across
the warm sector.  The resulting synoptic pattern is very favorable
for significant severe weather over portions of OK/AR/MO/KS, with
the potential for strong tornadoes, very large hail, and widespread
damaging winds.  However, the mesoscale details of the forecast
result in considerable uncertainty regarding the corridors of
greatest risk.

...Eastern OK/Western AR/Southwest MO...
A southern stream shortwave trough over TX will track northeastward
today.  Large scale ascent ahead of this feature will weaken the cap
and likely lead to rather widespread convective development by early
afternoon over much eastern OK and western AR.  Forecast soundings
in this area show a very unstable air mass and favorable low and
deep layer shear profiles for supercell development.  All severe
hazards are possible, including strong tornadoes.  Refer to MCD #874
for further details.

...North TX/Central OK/Eastern KS/southeast NE...
Behind the aforementioned convective development, a pronounced
dryline will become established from west-central OK into central
KS.  Strong heating along and west of the dryline, combined with
dewpoints near 70f to the east, will result in extreme instability
and only a weak cap.  Large-scale mid-level height falls/forcing for
ascent associated with the approaching upper trough over the
southern Rockies will lead to discrete/intense supercell development
by mid/late afternoon - potentially along the entire length from
north TX into KS.  These storms will pose a risk of very large hail
and strong tornadoes through the early evening.

Farther north in northeast KS and southeast NE, the Pacific cold
front will impinge on the dryline, aiding convective development but
perhaps leading to more linear forcing.  Nevertheless, large hail
and tornadoes will still be possible.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0226 PM CDT Mon May 19 2025

Valid 211200Z - 221200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
CAROLINAS AND MID-ATLANTIC/SOUTHEAST STATES...

...SUMMARY...
At least isolated severe storms are possible Wednesday mainly across
parts of North Carolina and nearby parts of southern Virginia and/or
eastern South Carolina.

...Carolinas and Mid-Atlantic/Southeast States...
Within the base of the Great Lakes-centered upper trough, strong
westerlies aloft will exist over the Carolinas, central/southern
Appalachians and Mid-Atlantic States on Wednesday. Scattered
thunderstorms will likely be ongoing in the morning, potentially
complexifying the details of where the north/south extent of
most-favorable severe storm ingredients will materialize. However,
severe-weather potential currently seems most likely to set up
across North Carolina and possibly southern Virginia in vicinity of
the warm front and a weak surface wave. A semi-focused corridor of
supercell/severe-storm potential could materialize with
hail/damaging wind and tornado potential. Slight Risk-caliber severe
probabilities are plausible into the Day 2 or Day 1 time frame as
forecast details are refined.

Other more isolated severe storms may occur through the afternoon
with southwestward extent along the southeastward-advancing cold
front into southeast Georgia and northern Florida, where moderate
buoyancy is expected coincident with the southern edge of stronger
westerlies aloft.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0201 PM CDT Mon May 19 2025

Valid 201200Z - 211200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The main change made to the Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook Update was to
add Elevated highlights to portions of Minnesota. Here, deep-layer
easterly flow north of both a surface low, and developing mid-level
cyclone over the Midwest, will encourage dry and breezy conditions
by afternoon. 15-20 mph sustained easterly surface winds will
coincide with 20-30 percent RH as the boundary layer mixes,
supporting elevated conditions atop fuels that are at least
marginally supportive of wildfire spread.

Across the rest of the CONUS, the previous forecast (see below)
remains on track.

..Squitieri.. 05/19/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0200 AM CDT Mon May 19 2025/

...Synopsis...
A large-scale trough will deamplify as it advances eastward into the
eastern half of the CONUS on Tuesday. On the backside of this
system, dry/breezy post-frontal conditions will develop across parts
of the central Plains. However, preceding rainfall and a marginal
spatial overlap of the breezy winds and low RH should limit the
overall fire-weather risk. Broad/enhanced westerly flow will
continue to support dry conditions across the Southwest into the
southern High Plains, though surface winds will weaken compared to
Monday, as the strongest midlevel flow shifts eastward with the
midlevel trough.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1230 PM CDT Mon May 19 2025

Valid 201200Z - 211200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
MID-SOUTH AND TENNESSEE VALLEY...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are likely across portions of the Mid-South,
Tennessee Valley, and lower Ohio River Valley on Tuesday, including
damaging winds and tornadoes, a few of which could be strong.

...Mid-South and Tennessee/Lower Ohio Valleys...
Residual thunderstorms and associated cloud cover are expected to be
ongoing across the Mid-South to lower Ohio Valley Tuesday morning,
with the early day extensiveness of these storms, and related
outflow/differential heating, to be key factors, and points of
uncertainty, regarding later-day severe potential. This will
especially be the case with northward extent toward the Ohio River
and northern parts of the Cumberland Plateau.  

On the south/southwest edge of this early day activity, relatively
rapid air mass recovery and destabilization can be expected, owing
to sustained low-level moisture transport from the southwest in
tandem with cloud breaks and an advancing mid-level dry slot. This
will be as an upper low shifts northeastward over the middle
Missouri Valley and Upper Midwest, with a cyclonically curved
mid/upper-level jet streak overspreading the warm sector, which
could be convectively contaminated near/north of the Ohio River. At
least moderate buoyancy is forecast to develop across the
unperturbed and weakly capped warm sector by early afternoon. 

It should be noted that multiple sub-regional areas, particularly
across central/eastern portions of Kentucky and Tennessee, could
receive multiple repeat-rounds of severe storms on Tuesday.
Thunderstorm development will likely occur rather early in the
afternoon as inhibition will be quickly eroded and dynamic forcing
for ascent overspreads the warm sector. Very favorable supercell
wind profiles will exist across most of the region via the mid-level
jet and a diurnally sustained 30+ kt low-level jet. 

Initial supercells will pose a threat for all severe weather hazards
including the potential for strong tornadoes, but a mixed convective
mode should evolve as upscale growth occurs into multiple clusters.
Relatively widespread damaging winds, along with a continued
mixed-mode tornado potential, may occur by late afternoon and
evening as storms spread east-southeastward toward the Appalachians
vicinity.

...Carolinas and far southern Virginia...
Weak height falls will begin to influence the region by late in the
day with a warm front beginning to shift northward across the
region. At least a conditional or isolated potential for severe
storms including supercells will exist near the warm front and
within the immediately adjacent warm sector.

...THERE IS A MODERATE RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON
AND EVENING ACROSS FAR NORTH TEXAS...MUCH OF CENTRAL AND EASTERN
OKLAHOMA...SOUTHEAST KANSAS...AND THE OZARKS...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM EAST
TENNESSEE INTO SOUTH CAROLINA...

...SUMMARY...
Significant severe weather is likely from the central/southern
Plains into the the Ozarks today into tonight. All severe weather
hazards are expected, to include tornadoes (some potentially strong
to intense), very large hail, and severe winds.

A powerful upper trough over the southern Rockies will eject into
the Plains today, with an associated 70-80 knot mid level jet nosing
into OK.  Meanwhile, the primary surface low will deepen over
northwest OK and a southerly low-level jet will strengthen across
the warm sector.  The resulting synoptic pattern is very favorable
for significant severe weather over portions of OK/AR/MO/KS, with
the potential for strong tornadoes, very large hail, and widespread
damaging winds.  However, the mesoscale details of the forecast
result in considerable uncertainty regarding the corridors of
greatest risk.

...Eastern OK/Western AR/Southwest MO...
A southern stream shortwave trough over TX will track northeastward
today.  Large scale ascent ahead of this feature will weaken the cap
and likely lead to rather widespread convective development by early
afternoon over much eastern OK and western AR.  Forecast soundings
in this area show a very unstable air mass and favorable low and
deep layer shear profiles for supercell development.  All severe
hazards are possible, including strong tornadoes.  Refer to MCD #874
for further details.

...North TX/Central OK/Eastern KS/southeast NE...
Behind the aforementioned convective development, a pronounced
dryline will become established from west-central OK into central
KS.  Strong heating along and west of the dryline, combined with
dewpoints near 70f to the east, will result in extreme instability
and only a weak cap.  Large-scale mid-level height falls/forcing for
ascent associated with the approaching upper trough over the
southern Rockies will lead to discrete/intense supercell development
by mid/late afternoon - potentially along the entire length from
north TX into KS.  These storms will pose a risk of very large hail
and strong tornadoes through the early evening.

Farther north in northeast KS and southeast NE, the Pacific cold
front will impinge on the dryline, aiding convective development but
perhaps leading to more linear forcing.  Nevertheless, large hail
and tornadoes will still be possible.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0751 AM CDT Mon May 19 2025

Valid 191300Z - 201200Z

...THERE IS A MODERATE RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FAR NORTH
TEXAS...MUCH OF CENTRAL AND EASTERN OKLAHOMA...SOUTHEAST
KANSAS...AND THE OZARKS...

...SUMMARY...
Significant severe weather is likely from the central/southern
Plains into the the Ozarks today into tonight. All severe weather
hazards are expected, to include tornadoes (some potentially strong
to intense), very large hail, and severe winds.

... Synopsis ...

A large, amplified trough over the Rockies will shift slowly
eastward into the Plains today. Embedded within this longwave
trough, a complex evolution is expected. Downstream of the trough, a
negatively tilted shortwave trough will deepen and close off across
the northern Plains. Meanwhile, upstream, a closed low currently
over Idaho will dig southeastward, open up, and eject into the
central Plains.

As this evolution occurs, strong midlevel flow (in excess of 50
knots) will remain across much of the central and southern Plains
through the forecast period. By late in the afternoon, midlevel flow
will strengthen to perhaps 70 knots in response to the ejecting low
into the central Plains.

At the surface, the main synoptic low will be somewhat
diffuse/elongated over northwest Kansas into southwest Nebraska this
morning. Extending southward from this low, a dryline will stretch
through western Kansas into the Oklahoma and Texas Panhandles,
continuing into west Texas. A warm front will extend eastward near
the Kansas-Nebraska border before curving southeastward into
Missouri into the southern Appalachians. 

The surface low is expected to gradually fill today as it slowly
moves east/northeast into south-central Nebraska, Despite this, rich
Gulf moisture will be maintained across the central and southern
Plains. Dewpoint temperatures at or above 70F will advect northward
from Texas through Oklahoma perhaps to as far north as northeast
Kansas. 

During the afternoon, strong diurnal heating along the dryline may
result in a sub-synoptic low developing across northwest Oklahoma.
This low will slowly progress east along the Oklahoma-Kansas border
during the afternoon, weakening with time.

... Southern and Central Plains into the Ozarks ...

A strongly sheared atmosphere will already be in place at the start
of the forecast period. As diurnal heating commences and 70F
dewpoints advect northward, the atmosphere across much of the
central and southern Plains will become strongly to extremely
unstable as well, with surface-based CAPE values between 3000-5000
J/kg across the region.

Multiple rounds of storms are expected across the region today. One
such initiating mechanism looks to be a subtle shortwave trough
embedded in the larger scale flow currently across eastern New
Mexico. This wave should initiate thunderstorms across eastern
Oklahoma northward into eastern Kansas by midday. It is unclear if
these storms will initially be elevated, but as they move east and
the atmosphere destabilizes further ahead of the line, a transition
to more surface-based convection should occur. At the same time, the
low-level jet is forecast to strengthen/reorganize across eastern
Oklahoma/western Arkansas into western Missouri. This will yield
ample low-level curvature to the hodograph. Thus, given the strongly
sheared environment in place, supercells capable of producing all
severe hazards, including strong tornadoes, will be possible with
this first round of storms. 

By mid-to-late afternoon, 30-60 meter mid-level height falls should
overspread the dryline as it mixes east into central Kansas
southward into western north Texas. Rapid thunderstorm development
is expected along the dryline given the forecast extreme
instability. These thunderstorms should develop west of the better
low-level jet/flow, where the low-level flow is expected to be a
little more veered than across eastern Kansas/Oklahoma. This veered
low-level flow still will result in a strongly sheered environment,
but with more straight hodographs and less low-level curvature. The
result should be another round of supercells, albeit with a tendency
to split. These supercells will be capable of producing very large
hail and tornadoes. The number of supercells across the dryline
combined with a propensity to split, may result in destructive
interference and result in a more episodic hail and tornado threat.

In addition to the hail and tornado threat, the number of expected
thunderstorms in the presence of a very moist and unstable
atmosphere with steep lapse rates may result in strong downdraft
winds. The most likely region for this will be across portions of
northeast Oklahoma, northwest Arkansas, southeast Kansas, and
southwest Missouri. A 45% wind area was included in this outlook.

... Southern Illinois into Southern Appalachians ...

Along the northern periphery of shortwave ridging over the
Southeast, a midlevel jet streak will cross the southern
Appalachians during the afternoon. Here, an influx of steep midlevel
lapse rates atop rich boundary-layer moisture will yield strong
surface-based instability along/south of a warm front draped across
the region. Scattered thunderstorms will spread east-southeastward
along/south of the front from TN into the southern Appalachians,
where the favorable buoyancy and around 40-50 kt of effective shear
will promote organization into clusters and a couple splitting
supercell structures. Damaging winds and large hail will be possible
with the strongest storms.

Overnight, additional thunderstorms may develop across southern
Illinois and western Kentucky in association with warm-air advection
ahead of the main area of thunderstorms to the west. These
thunderstorms will also pose the potential for small hail and
isolated wind damage.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0352 AM CDT Mon May 19 2025

Valid 221200Z - 271200Z

...DISCUSSION...
A dry airmass will be in place across most of the eastern CONUS on
Thursday/D4 as a cold front moves into the western Atlantic and
stalls near the Gulf Coast. This will likely represent the minimum
threat during the extended severe weather period, with isolated
strong to severe storms across Texas likely the only threat area.

Starting Friday/D5, richer low-level moisture will advect over the
southern High Plains. However, this will also correspond to
shortwave ridging building across the Plains over the weekend
followed by zonal flow into early next week. This pattern may
support some localized threat each day, but more widespread,
predictable severe weather is unlikely at an extended range. As
these days draw closer, more confined regions of threat may become
more clear and allow for severe weather probabilities to be added.

Areas affected...much of western Oklahoma...southwest
Kansas...extreme eastern Panhandle

Concerning...Severe potential...Tornado Watch likely 

Valid 182021Z - 182215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered supercells capable of strong tornadoes and very
large hail are forecast from late afternoon into the evening from
parts of northwest Oklahoma into southwest Kansas. EF3+ tornadoes
may occur.

DISCUSSION...Surface analysis and visible imagery clearly outline
the unstable warm sector, situated between a dryline from southeast
CO into the eastern TX Panhandle, and a warm front/retreating
outflow draped across northern OK into south-central KS. The air
mass has become very unstable, and will continue to develop
northward. This air mass is coincident with an already strongly
sheared environment with effective SRH over 200 m2/s2. These
low-level shear values will increase markedly later today and during
the evening as the low level jet increases with effective SRH of
300-400 m2/s2 common.

While very cool air and clouds currently exist over northern OK into
south-central KS, a strengthening low-level jet will likely yield
clearing later in the evening, which may allow the tornado threat to
expand farther eastward.

Mesoscale Discussion 0859
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK

Areas affected...northeast Colorado...western Nebraska...northwest
Kansas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 181912Z - 182145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...Supercells capable of very large hail, tornadoes, and
damaging wind are likely to develop after 21Z over northeast
Colorado, spreading into western Nebraska and northwest Kansas
through evening.

DISCUSSION...A surface low continues to deepen over eastern CO as
the shortwave trough moves across the area. Surface analysis shows a
prominent plume of low-level moisture extending out of western KS
and across northeast CO, where dewpoints are holding in the lower
50s F. 

Full heating near and south of this moisture plume will erode the
minimal capping inversion by around 21Z, and rapid thunderstorm
development is expected. The combination of strong instability,
steep lapse rates, and veering winds with height will strongly favor
supercells capable of very large hail, and a few tornadoes. Activity
should easily remain severe into NE and KS this evening as the
southeasterly low-level jet persists, maintaining moisture advection
as well as shear and inflow.

Mesoscale Discussion 0858
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0158 PM CDT Sun May 18 2025

Areas affected...Northwest to west-central Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 181858Z - 182130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm development along the dryline is expected
roughly between 20-22 UTC across northwest to west-central Texas.
The convective environment will support supercells capable of large
hail, severe gusts, and a few tornadoes. Watch issuance is likely as
storms begin to develop.

DISCUSSION...Recent GOES visible imagery shows shallow, but slowly
deepening, cumulus along and just ahead of a sharpening dryline as
it continues to mix east and boundary-layer depth increases amid
filtered diurnal heating. Latest RAP/HRRR forecast soundings suggest
any lingering MLCIN will be minimized as surface temperatures warm
into the 92-95 F range over the next few hours within the warm
sector. Regional VWPs show flow within the lowest 2-3 km AGL
oriented roughly along the dryline, which should promote adequate
residence times for parcels to reach their LFCs and initiate deep
convection. Latest high-res solutions suggest this should occur
generally between 20-22 UTC. Thunderstorms will mature within a very
unstable air mass with MLCAPE values exceeding 4000 J/kg and
effective shear on the order of 40-50 knots. Limited directional
shear will initially promote splitting supercells with an attendant
very large hail threat (most probable max hail size may be 2-3
inches in diameter). Southeasterly low-level winds across northwest
TX may support adequate low-level veering for some tornado threat.
Further south (roughly south of I-20), 1.5 to 2.5 km LCL heights and
more backed low-level flow will modulate the initial tornado
potential. After 00 UTC a strengthening low-level jet will increase
low-level hodograph curvature and support an increasing tornado
threat with any remaining discrete right-moving supercells across
much of central/northern TX. Watch issuance will likely be needed as
thunderstorm initiation becomes more imminent.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1120 AM CDT Sun May 18 2025

Valid 181700Z - 191200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN
NEW MEXICO INTO FAR WEST TEXAS...

The previous forecast remains largely on track. Visible satellite
depicts clearing skies across the southern High Plains, supporting
robust boundary-layer mixing. Surface observations show evidence of
a developing dryline over the TX Panhandle, with 10-20 mph sustained
southwesterly surface winds amid 10-30 percent RH in the
post-dryline environment. Some surface observations across southern
New Mexico already depict Critical meteorological conditions (i.e.
single-digit RH coinciding with sustained winds well over 20 mph).
With continued boundary-layer heating/mixing, these Critical
conditions should become common across most of the southern High
Plains behind the dryline, in agreement with the latest guidance
consensus. However, Critical highlights remain only where fuels are
highly receptive to wildfire-spread potential.

Guidance consensus also still shows the potential for 15-20 mph
sustained northwesterly surface winds coinciding with 15-25 percent
RH across portions of the California Valley region later this
afternoon, where Elevated highlights remain in place.

..Squitieri.. 05/18/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0110 AM CDT Sun May 18 2025/

...Synopsis...
As a mid-level shortwave trough progresses from the Four Corners to
the southern High Plains, and a surface lee cyclone deepens
throughout the morning and afternoon, Critical fire-weather
conditions are anticipated across much of southern New Mexico.
Further west, mid-level northerly flow on the western side of the
trough is expected to bring Elevated fire-weather conditions to the
Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys.

...Southern New Mexico...
Deep boundary-layer mixing behind a sharpening dryline, along with a
deepening surface cyclone and associated gradient wind response,
will be responsible for widespread Critical fire-weather conditions
this afternoon. Sustained winds of 25 MPH and relative humidity
below 10%, along with highly receptive fuels, will result in
conditions that support rapid wildfire ignition and spread. Some
downslope winds in southern and eastern New Mexico may even locally
reach Extremely Critical criteria, with sustained winds exceeding 30
MPH. However, such conditions appear to be too localized for larger
highlights at this time. Additionally, the Critical meteorological
conditions will exist well into the Texas Panhandle and portions of
southern Kansas -- but ERC fuels guidance shows fuels are not quite
as receptive, warranting only Elevated highlights. 

...Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys...
Deep boundary-layer mixing beneath modest mid-level northerly flow
will result in dry and windy conditions across much of the interior
California valleys. Winds of 15 MPH and relative humidity at or
below 15% are expected. Fuels appear more marginal, but there is
some signal for fuel receptiveness, warranting at least Elevated
highlights.

Mesoscale Discussion 0854
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0656 AM CDT Sun May 18 2025

Areas affected...central Arkansas and northern Mississippi

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 284...

Valid 181156Z - 181400Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 284
continues.

SUMMARY...Long-lived cluster of thunderstorms, with a history of
producing wind damage, continues to move through central Arkansas.
The overall environment should continue to support a severe threat
ahead of this MCS through at least mid morning.

DISCUSSION...Long-lived linear MCS, with a history of producing wind
damage, continues to move east-southeast through much of Arkansas
this morning. This MCS is moving along a west-northwest to
east-southeast CAPE gradient stretching from northeast Oklahoma into
southern Georgia and is following a similar path as to an earlier
MCS from last evening into earlier this morning. 

The overall large-scale environment will continue to support
maintenance of this MCS as the MCS has access to MUCAPE greater than
2000 J/kg and effective shear around 50 knots. The organization of
the MCS, the overall favorable environment,and knowledge that the
earlier MCS traversed a similar environment and is continuing
through Alabama supports the severe threat through the morning. A
downstream watch may become necessary for portions of far eastern
Arkansas and northern Mississippi as the MCS approaches the edge of
Severe Thunderstorm Watch #284.

Mesoscale Discussion 0853
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0640 AM CDT Sun May 18 2025

Areas affected...Central Alabama and far west-central Georgia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 181140Z - 181245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...A thunderstorm cluster moving across central Alabama will
pose a threat for isolated large hail and wind damage in the near
term. Longer term evolution of this cluster is less certain, but the
area will continue to be monitored for potential watch issuance.

DISCUSSION...Long-lived cluster of thunderstorms continues to move
across central Alabama this morning along the instability gradient.
The strongest of these thunderstorms (located across eastern
Tuscaloosa County) appears to have increased in intensity over the
last hour and has even developed a rear-inflow jet (RIJ) --
suggested by radar reflectivity structure and an increase in
rear-to-front wind speeds. This will pose a damaging wind threat in
the short term.

Additionally, overall reflectivity structure of the thunderstorm
complex suggests the development of a mesoscale convective vortex.
Should this be the case, an increase in updraft intensity would be
expected in the near term owing to increasing convergence and
stronger deep-layer shear. MUCAPE is around 1000 J/kg and deep-layer
shear around 50 knots across the thunderstorm cluster now, but drops
off to around 1000 J/kg and 30-40 knots as the cluster approaches
western Georgia.

As the thunderstorms move east, the lack of clarity of the MCV
evolution and a slightly less favorable environment results in
uncertainty as to whether a severe thunderstorm watch will be needed
downstream. Conditions will continue to be monitored for potential
watch issuance.
