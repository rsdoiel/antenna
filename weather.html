Mesoscale Discussion 1701
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0348 PM CDT Thu Jul 17 2025

Areas affected...portions of northern and central Montana

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 172048Z - 172245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated to widely scattered thunderstorms are expected
this afternoon and evening. A few supercells capable of hail and
damaging winds are expected. A WW is possible, although it is
uncertain when the severe risk will maximize.

DISCUSSION...Afternoon visible and radar imagery show initial
thunderstorm development is underway across far northern MT and
southern Canada. Aided by synoptic ascent from a shortwave trough
within northwesterly flow and heating along a stalled frontal
boundary, continued convective development is expected over the next
several hours. Modest moisture and somewhat cool surface
temperatures have limited boundary-layer destabilization so far this
afternoon. Still, with little inhibition, weak MLCAPE (500-700 J/kg)
will be sufficient for stronger updrafts. Additional destabilization
is expected as low-level warm advection along the boundary increases
into this evening. Elongated hodographs owing to enhanced
northwesterly flow aloft observed from the 18z TFX RAOB and area
VADs will support a supercell storm mode capable of hail and
isolated damaging gusts.

Despite weaker buoyancy, continued ascent along the stalled front
will likely serve as a focus for storm intensification over the next
couple of hours. This is supported by recent CAM guidance which
shows a few longer-lived supercells into this evening. The exact
timing of the severe risk remains unclear as destabilization
continues and storms may take some time to mature. However, at least
an isolated severe risk should gradually increase over the next few
hours. Given the broadly favorable environment for large hail and
severe gusts, a WW may be needed.

Mesoscale Discussion 1700
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0340 PM CDT Thu Jul 17 2025

Areas affected...Portions of VT...NH...and ME

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 521...

Valid 172040Z - 172245Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 521
continues.

SUMMARY...Threat for damaging gusts and/or a brief tornado or two
continues across portions of VT, NH, and ME.

DISCUSSION...Early afternoon soundings (i.e. 18Z) at CAR and GYX
sampled a moist and unstable airmass across the region, with little
to no convective inhibition. The CAR sounding also sampled moderate
vertical shear (i.e. 0-6 km bulk shear of 43 kt), while notably
weaker deep-layer shear (i.e. 0-6 km bulk shear of 25 kt) was
sampled farther south at GYX. This variance in shear matches
previous expectations and continues to place the greatest severe
risk across northern ME. 

An initially more cellular mode has trended towards a more
cell-in-line mode over the last hour or so. Even so, the
environmental conditions favor a continued threat for strong to
severe storms. Strong downbursts remain the greatest risk,
particularly as mid-level flow gradually strengthens. There is
enough low-level shear (i.e. 0-1 km 15 to 20 kt) to support a brief
tornado as well.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0257 PM CDT Thu Jul 17 2025

Valid 181200Z - 191200Z

A mid-level trough coming into the Pacific Northwest interacting
with peripheral monsoon moisture will support mainly dry, isolated
high-based thunderstorms across portions of northeastern NV into
southeastern ID where pockets of receptive fuels remain. Farther
southeast across the Greater Four Corners region, deeper monsoon
moisture (precipitable water values greater than 0.80") will support
heavier precipitation cores from thunderstorms, mitigating new
ignition potential. Otherwise, dry and breezy conditions east of the
Cascades are still expected as westerly flow increases from the
deepening Pacific Northwest trough. An elevated fire weather threat
remains with locally critical conditions possible in favored Cascade
gaps amid dry fuels.

..Williams.. 07/17/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1258 AM CDT Thu Jul 17 2025/

...Synopsis...
A deeper trough will traverse the Pacific Northwest on D2/Friday
bringing more widespread Elevated conditions across the areas along
and east of the Cascades. Afternoon relative humidity around 10-20
percent will overlap sustained westerly winds at 10-15 mph (locally
higher). Some locally Critical conditions may persist for a couple
of hours where terrain enhancements favor locally stronger winds in
the Cascade Gaps. 

...Dry Thunderstorms...
The western shortwave will bring forcing for ascent across portions
of northern Nevada into southern Idaho and eastern Wyoming. This
area remains on the periphery of deeper moisture across the
Southwest into the Great Basin. High based convection and very dry
boundary layer conditions will favor little to no measurable
precipitation with potential for new ignitions from lightning.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0239 PM CDT Thu Jul 17 2025

Valid 172000Z - 181200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR PORTIONS OF
THE NORTHERN HIGH PLAINS AND NORTHERN NEW ENGLAND...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered damaging winds and a tornado remain possible across
northern New England this afternoon.  A confined corridor of large
hail and severe gusts appears possible from north-central Montana to
southwest North Dakota this evening.

...20Z Update...
The primary change to the outlook was to add 15 percent wind
probabilities across portions of northern into eastern Montana.
Here, supercells and/or short line segments should develop amid
strong mid/upper flow overspreading the region. Downward momentum
transport of this stronger flow aloft may promote efficient severe
gust production with the stronger storms. Otherwise, the previous
forecast (see below) remains on track, with minor changes made to
thunder/severe probabilities to reflect the latest observations and
guidance consensus.

..Squitieri.. 07/17/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1125 AM CDT Thu Jul 17 2025/

...Northeast...
Midday visible-satellite imagery shows cloud breaks and surface
observations show warming temperatures which imply a destabilizing
airmass.  A lead, convectively enhanced disturbance evident in
radar/satellite imagery, is moving east across southern Quebec,
while an upstream larger-scale mid-level trough continues eastward
across Ontario and into Quebec later today.  A cyclone will develop
northeast from eastern Ontario into eastern Quebec while a cold
front pushes through the Lower Great Lakes and through much of the
Northeast through mid evening.  The deep moisture through much of
the troposphere and weak lapse rate profiles, which were sampled by
the 12 UTC Buffalo and Albany, NY raobs, will undergo moderate
destabilization by early to mid afternoon.  Although forcing for
ascent will favor Quebec into northern New England, scattered
thunderstorms will likely develop from Maine southward into southern
New England.  The greatest potential for some organized storms will
favor northern New England where stronger effective shear (30-40 kt)
and adequate buoyancy will promote a wind-damage threat with the
stronger storms.  Forecast sounding over northern Maine show
enlarged hodographs for a few hours, which may aid in low-level
mesocyclone development and perhaps a risk for a tornado.  Lower
coverage of severe is forecast farther south where weaker shear will
tend to limit storm intensity.  The severe activity will likely
diminish by the early to mid evening.  

...Northern High Plains...
Model guidance continues to show a focused corridor of supercell
thunderstorm potential from north-central MT to southwest ND, mainly
this evening.  Water-vapor imagery shows a mid-level shortwave
trough rotating southeastward across the southern part of the
Canadian Rockies moving towards the northern High Plains.  Forecast
soundings this afternoon show elongated hodographs amidst modest
buoyancy, which would support the development of a supercell or two
during the evening.  Large hail is the primary hazard with this
activity but severe gusts may occur on a localized basis.  An
isolated hail/wind risk may persist along the ND/SD border vicinity
overnight.

...Mid-Atlantic to the Southern High Plains...
A surface front draped over the south-central Plains
east-northeastward into the mid MS/OH Valleys will focus scattered
thunderstorm activity this afternoon.  The eastern part of this
broader region over the Mid-Atlantic into the OH Valley will be
displaced from the mid-level trough over influencing storm activity
over the Northeast.  A remnant MCV and outflow from overnight storms
in the MO/KS/OK vicinity will aid in developing storms and perhaps
localized threats for sporadic hail/wind mainly this afternoon. 
Isolated damaging winds may also occur with thunderstorms that
develop east of the central Appalachians this afternoon, even though
coverage should be somewhat less.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0230 PM CDT Thu Jul 17 2025

Valid 191200Z - 201200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ROUGHLY FROM IOWA
INTO ILLINOIS AND INDIANA...

...SUMMARY...
Corridors of strong to severe storms are expected from the northern
and central High Plains to the Mid-Mississippi and Lower Ohio
Valleys on Saturday.

...IA/IL/IN...
Model QPF differences aside, the overarching theme is for a large
area of strong instability to develop near a stalled front from
southern IA/northern MO into IL and IN Saturday afternoon with mid
70s F dewpoints. This will exist beneath the southern fringe of
perhaps 40 kt west/northwest midlevel flow, and the combination of
strong instability and favorable deep-layer mean winds will favor
corridors of severe storms with damaging winds. Shear may also favor
severe hail, and even a few supercells given such large CAPE over
IA/IL/IN. The risk area will likely be adjusted in subsequent
outlook cycles as the event nears.

...High Plains...
Modest westerly midlevel flow of 30-40 kt will exist over the
northern High Plains, ahead of a broad upper trough over the Pacific
Northwest/northern Rockies. Cool midlevel temperatures will also
exist, steepening lapse rates. Strong heating is likely within a
surface trough from eastern MT southward across the High Plains,
with a ribbon of 1500-2000 J/kg MUCAPE wrapping northwestward around
a MN surface high. Cells capable of hail and localized severe gusts
will be possible, and a severe MCS is not out of the question
overnight into ND as the low-level jet increases. Greater
probabilities may be required in later updates.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1217 PM CDT Thu Jul 17 2025

Valid 181200Z - 191200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE
NORTHERN PLAINS...AND OVER MUCH OF VIRGINIA INTO NORTH CAROLINA...

...SUMMARY...
Strong to severe thunderstorms are possible across portions of South
Dakota and Nebraska into southern Minnesota and Iowa. Additional
strong to severe storms may occur across portions of West Virginia,
Virginia and North Carolina.

...Northern Plains...
A midlevel, low-amplitude wave will move from the Dakotas into MN
during the day, with a cold front gradually moving south from
western SD into western NE. Southwest winds at 850 mb will aid lift
and theta-e advection from ND into northern MN, with early day
elevated thunderstorms expected.

As heating occurs, low pressure will develop from south-central SD
into central NE, with convergence focused in this region. At least
isolated cells are expected from southeast SD into central NE by
00Z, with hail and localized wind potential. Additional cells will
likely drop southeast out of eastern WY during the evening, with
localized hail/wind potential. 

Model solutions vary regarding MCS potential during the evening from
SD/NE into southern MN/IA, but it does appear likely at least
localized corridors/clusters of storms will persist through the
night as capping will not be particularly strong, and southwest 850
mb flow aids warm advection. Damaging gusts are conditionally
possible.

...WV/VA into NC...
Neutral height tendencies will exist on Friday as an upper high
remains just to the south, and an upper trough exits the
northeastern states. Westerly midlevel flow will average 25-35 kt as
a weak surface trough develops near the VA/NC border during the
afternoon.

Daytime heating combined with 70s F dewpoints will lead tall CAPE
profiles with over 2000 J/kg MLCAPE and precipitable water over
2.00". Storms will form over the higher terrain along the WV/VA
border and spread east during the afternoon. Additional development
is likely near the surface trough into southern VA to northern NC.
Given favorable time of day coincident with peak heating, locally
damaging outflow winds may occur.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1159 AM CDT Thu Jul 17 2025

Valid 171700Z - 181200Z

...Dry Thunderstorms...
Southerly flow on the eastern fringe of a mid-level low entering
southern California will aid in northward transport of monsoon
moisture into the Desert Southwest and Four Corners region. Isolated
dry thunderstorms are expected on the northern periphery of the
deeper moisture now across AZ and NM, where surface dewpoints are in
the upper 40s to 60s. The isolated dry thunderstorm threat was
contracted overall across the Great Basin, UT and western
CO/southwestern WY owing to latest model guidance, current position
of the monsoon moisture plume, alignment of remaining receptive
fuels as well as to account for recent precipitation footprints over
the last 48 hours.

..Williams.. 07/17/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1257 AM CDT Thu Jul 17 2025/

...Synopsis...
A shortwave trough will glance the Pacific Northwest bringing an
increase of westerly flow aloft across the Cascades into the Cascade
Gaps. As a result, areas of increased westerly downslope flow can be
expected along and just east of the Cascades in the Columbia River
Basin. Sustained winds 10-15 mph (locally higher in the Cascade
Gaps) overlap with afternoon relative humidity reductions to around
10-20 percent. An Elevated delineation was added with this outlook
to support this potential.

...Dry Thunderstorms...
A closed low off the coast of Baja California will bring moisture
northward across portions of the Southwest into the Great Basin. On
the fringe of this deeper moisture, isolated dry thunderstorm
potential will continue across portions of western Colorado into
western Wyoming, Utah, far southern Idaho and eastern Nevada. Here
precipitable water values drop to around 0.50" or less with more
limited coverage. Some mix of wet/dry thunderstorms will be possible
in central Utah and west-central Colorado but storm motions around
15-20 kts will likely yield little measurable precipitation.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS NORTHERN
NEW ENGLAND AND THE NORTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered damaging winds and a tornado are possible across northern
New England this afternoon.  A confined corridor of large hail and
severe gusts appears possible from north-central Montana to
southwest North Dakota this evening.

...Northeast...
Midday visible-satellite imagery shows cloud breaks and surface
observations show warming temperatures which imply a destabilizing
airmass.  A lead, convectively enhanced disturbance evident in
radar/satellite imagery, is moving east across southern Quebec,
while an upstream larger-scale mid-level trough continues eastward
across Ontario and into Quebec later today.  A cyclone will develop
northeast from eastern Ontario into eastern Quebec while a cold
front pushes through the Lower Great Lakes and through much of the
Northeast through mid evening.  The deep moisture through much of
the troposphere and weak lapse rate profiles, which were sampled by
the 12 UTC Buffalo and Albany, NY raobs, will undergo moderate
destabilization by early to mid afternoon.  Although forcing for
ascent will favor Quebec into northern New England, scattered
thunderstorms will likely develop from Maine southward into southern
New England.  The greatest potential for some organized storms will
favor northern New England where stronger effective shear (30-40 kt)
and adequate buoyancy will promote a wind-damage threat with the
stronger storms.  Forecast sounding over northern Maine show
enlarged hodographs for a few hours, which may aid in low-level
mesocyclone development and perhaps a risk for a tornado.  Lower
coverage of severe is forecast farther south where weaker shear will
tend to limit storm intensity.  The severe activity will likely
diminish by the early to mid evening.  

...Northern High Plains...
Model guidance continues to show a focused corridor of supercell
thunderstorm potential from north-central MT to southwest ND, mainly
this evening.  Water-vapor imagery shows a mid-level shortwave
trough rotating southeastward across the southern part of the
Canadian Rockies moving towards the northern High Plains.  Forecast
soundings this afternoon show elongated hodographs amidst modest
buoyancy, which would support the development of a supercell or two
during the evening.  Large hail is the primary hazard with this
activity but severe gusts may occur on a localized basis.  An
isolated hail/wind risk may persist along the ND/SD border vicinity
overnight.

...Mid-Atlantic to the Southern High Plains...
A surface front draped over the south-central Plains
east-northeastward into the mid MS/OH Valleys will focus scattered
thunderstorm activity this afternoon.  The eastern part of this
broader region over the Mid-Atlantic into the OH Valley will be
displaced from the mid-level trough over influencing storm activity
over the Northeast.  A remnant MCV and outflow from overnight storms
in the MO/KS/OK vicinity will aid in developing storms and perhaps
localized threats for sporadic hail/wind mainly this afternoon. 
Isolated damaging winds may also occur with thunderstorms that
develop east of the central Appalachians this afternoon, even though
coverage should be somewhat less.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0735 AM CDT Thu Jul 17 2025

Valid 171300Z - 181200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE NORTHEAST AND NORTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered damaging winds and a brief tornado are possible across
northern New England this afternoon. Isolated/sporadic damaging
winds may also occur across a broad swath of the
Northeast/Mid-Atlantic to the southern High Plains. A confined
corridor of large hail and severe gusts appears possible from
north-central Montana to southwest North Dakota this evening.

...Northeast...
The Slight Risk has been maintained across this region with no
changes. A shortwave trough will move northeastward from the Upper
Great Lakes to the Ontario/Quebec border vicinity by this evening. A
broad swath of enhanced 850-700 mb west-southwesterly winds is
forecast from PA/NJ northward into New England. Further weakening of
already poor mid-level lapse rates is anticipated across parts of
southern NY into southern New England. This may tend to limit
convective coverage across the northern Mid-Atlantic to southern New
England vicinity. But, farther north and in closer proximity to
ascent associated with the approaching mid-level shortwave trough,
scattered robust convection is anticipated this afternoon along the
Quebec border across northern New England. Sufficient instability
and deep-layer shear are forecast across this region to support a
mix of multicells and perhaps marginal supercells. Given the
enhanced low/mid-level flow, scattered damaging winds should be the
main threat with this activity as it moves generally
east-northeastward through the early evening, before eventually
weakening as it approaches the coast. Enough low-level hodograph
enlargement/curvature may also be present to support some risk for a
tornado or two.

...Mid-Atlantic to the Southern High Plains...
Extensive convection is ongoing this morning across
south-central/southeast KS into MO. This activity should generally
remain sub-severe, but it will help reinforce a front that is
expected to gradually sag southward and eventually stall across the
mid MS Valley to southern Plains today. Scattered to numerous
thunderstorms are expected to develop west of the Appalachians along
this boundary later this afternoon as diurnal heating occurs.
Moderate to strong instability amid steepened low-level rates
along/south of the outflow/front should support sporadic wet
microbursts. Isolated hail will be possible with thunderstorms in
the post-frontal upslope flow regime across parts of the southern
High Plains. But, modest deep-layer shear and warm temperatures
aloft across all these regions should temper the overall
intensity/coverage of severe convection. Isolated damaging winds may
also occur with thunderstorms that develop east of the central
Appalachians this afternoon, even though coverage should be somewhat
less.

...Northern Plains...
A narrow corridor of supercell potential remains evident across
north-central MT to southwest ND, mainly this evening. A positively
tilted mid-level shortwave trough over the southern Canadian Rockies
will progress eastward along the international border with MT/ND
today. Mid to late afternoon convective initiation should occur over
parts of southwest Alberta in association with this feature. A
confined plume of weak buoyancy ahead of this activity should
initially temper updraft intensity as it spreads east-southeastward
into north-central MT by late afternoon. But, favorably timed
strengthening of a 500-mb westerly jet over MT will aid in hodograph
elongation at mid/upper levels this evening. This could support a
long-lived supercell or two during the evening, impinging on the
nose of moderate instability that should be present across southeast
MT. Large hail should be the main threat with these supercells if
they can be maintained. An isolated hail/wind risk may persist along
the ND/SD border vicinity overnight.

Mesoscale Discussion 1677
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0350 PM CDT Tue Jul 15 2025

Areas affected...northeastern Nevada...northern Utah...southeastern
Idaho...and southwestern Wyoming

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 152050Z - 152315Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Storms will increase in coverage and intensity through the
afternoon, posing a threat of dry microburst winds.  Convective
trends will be monitored for the possibility of a watch.

DISCUSSION...A glancing influence from the shortwave trough to the
north is resulting in some large-scale ascent and an increase in
midlevlel winds this afternoon.  Initial storms are increasing in
coverage and intensity across northeastern Nevada, and this activity
is expected to spread east-northeastward through the afternoon into
southwestern Wyoming.  The 17Z DPG sounding characterizes the very
steep lapse rates (near dry adiabatic up to around 500 mb) in which
these storms are forming.  This environment will support very strong
downdrafts and dry-microburst potential.  Recent VWPs from Salt Lake
City indicate around 30 knots of mid-to-upper-level flow, which may
support some storm organization and propagation.  If storms are able
to organize into clusters, a severe thunderstorm watch may be
considered.

Mesoscale Discussion 1676
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0312 PM CDT Tue Jul 15 2025

Areas affected...eastern Idaho...southern Montana...and
northern/central Wyoming

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 152012Z - 152215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Storms are expected to increase in coverage and intensity
through the afternoon posing a risk of severe hail and winds. 
Convective trends will be monitored for the possibility of a watch.

DISCUSSION...Large-scale ascent ahead of a midlevel trough (evident
over the northern Intermountain West in water vapor imagery) is
resulting in thunderstorm development over portions of eastern Idaho
and southwestern Montana.  As this ascent overspreads Wyoming where
better instability is developing, storms are expected to intensify
and organize later this afternoon into the evening.  

Recent VWPs from the Pocatello radar indicate that midlevel westerly
flow has increased to around 40 knots as this disturbance
approaches.  Consequently, there should be enough shear for some
storm organization despite limited instability.  Steep midlevel
lapse rates may support some hail threat with the initial updraft
cores, but the primary threat will be severe winds, as these storms
are developing and moving into deep, well-mixed boundary layers. 
This environment will favor strong evaporative cooling and
dry-microburst potential.  If storms are able to grow upscale into
clusters, a more organized severe-wind threat may materialize
warranting watch issuance.

Mesoscale Discussion 1675
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0258 PM CDT Tue Jul 15 2025

Areas affected...south-central South Dakota into much of central
Nebraska

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 151958Z - 152230Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...Storms will erupt across south-central South Dakota into
northern and west-central Nebraska in the next 1-2 hours, producing
large hail initially followed by damaging winds.

DISCUSSION...A cold front stretches from east-central SD into
western NE and far eastern CO, with a surface low over western NE.
Satellite imagery shows strong heating and building CU fields along
the front and near the low, and this is where initiation will occur.

Deep-layer lapse rates continue to steepen as a midlevel wave
approaches from the west, and surface temperatures warm. When
combined with mid to upper 60s F dewpoints, moderately strong
instability is noted with MLCAPE to around 3000 J/kg.

Modest westerlies aloft combined with a persistent southerly
boundary-layer winds will support southeastward-moving storms. A few
supercells producing damaging hail are possible initially, but an
evolution to severe MCS is anticipated from late afternoon through
evening. Corridors of significant wind damage may occur.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 514
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
350 PM CDT Tue Jul 15 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Northern Kansas
  Western and Central Nebraska
  Southeast South Dakota

* Effective this Tuesday afternoon and evening from 350 PM until
  1100 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 80
    mph likely
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2
    inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Scattered thunderstorms are forecast to develop along a
front this afternoon into the evening and grow upscale into a linear
cluster.  Large hail will be the primary severe hazard this
afternoon before storms increase in coverage and congeal into one or
two linear clusters.  Severe gusts will become the primary severe
hazard during the evening as this activity moves east-southeast
across the Watch area.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 85
statute miles east and west of a line from 35 miles east northeast
of Chamberlain SD to 20 miles south southeast of Mccook NE. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU4).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 513...

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 70 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
28025.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 513
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
255 PM CDT Tue Jul 15 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Upper Peninsula Michigan
  Central and North-Central Minnesota
  Northern Wisconsin
  Lake Superior

* Effective this Tuesday afternoon and evening from 255 PM until
  1000 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2
    inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...Scattered clusters of strong to severe thunderstorms will
likely develop through the remainder of the afternoon and persist
into the evening.  The stronger thunderstorms will be capable of a
risk for large hail and severe gusts.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 45
statute miles north and south of a line from 30 miles south
southwest of Alexandria MN to 115 miles east of Ironwood MI. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU3).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
26025.

Mesoscale Discussion 1670
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0318 PM CDT Mon Jul 14 2025

Areas affected...eastern Wyoming...southwestern South Dakota...and
Nebraska Panhandle

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 142018Z - 142215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Storms are expected to increase in coverage and intensity
through the afternoon and evening.  Convective trends will be
monitored for the possibility of a severe thunderstorm watch.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorms initiated early this afternoon over the
higher terrain of Wyoming, as ascent associated with an approaching
midlevel shortwave trough overspreads the area.  Continued
initiation over the higher terrain along with new initiation farther
east along the a surface pressure trough will eventually pose a
severe-weather threat later this afternoon and evening.  

Although low-level moisture is mixing out across much of the area
this afternoon (upper 40s to low 50s F 2-m Td), very steep low-level
and midlevel lapse rates (per 18Z UNR sounding) are still resulting
in over 1000 J/kg of MLCAPE.  The inverted-v thermodynamic profiles
across the region will support an isolated dry-microburst threat for
the strongest storms.  For a more organized severe threat,
deep-layer shear is marginally supportive and strongest (around 30
knots) with northward extent into northeastern Wyoming and
southwestern South Dakota.  The latest CAM guidance suggests some
potential for upscale growth of convection into clusters posing an
organized severe-wind threat.  Convective trends will be monitored
for this scenario and the possibility of a watch.

Mesoscale Discussion 1669
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0218 PM CDT Mon Jul 14 2025

Areas affected...southeastern Georgia into northern/central Florida

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 141918Z - 142145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms are expected to increase in coverage and
intensity through the afternoon, posing an isolated threat of
damaging winds.  A severe thunderstorm watch is unlikely.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorms have initiated on low-level convergence
boundaries across the region this afternoon in a hot, unstable
(~2500 J/kg MLCAPE) airmass.  While upper-tropospheric flow is weak
(per XMR 14Z sounding), enhanced low-to-midlevel northerly flow on
the west side of the low off the Atlantic coast may help storm
organization.  Local VWPs indicate around 25-30 knots of flow
between 700 and 500 mb, which may help to organize
southward-to-south-southwestward-propagating clusters as cold pools
begin to merge.  These storms will pose a damaging-wind threat this
afternoon, but the impacts are expected to be too isolated to
warrant a watch.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0329 AM CDT Mon Jul 14 2025

Valid 171200Z - 221200Z

...DISCUSSION...
Upper ridging will build across the south-central and southeastern
U.S. during the Day 4-8 period. This will confine a series of
low-amplitude upper troughs to the northern tier of the U.S. along
the international border. Bouts of strong to severe thunderstorm
potential will be possible through the period as individual
shortwaves provide modestly enhanced mid/upper westerly flow from
the northern Plains to the Great Lakes vicinity. Given the generally
low-amplitude nature the upper pattern across the northern U.S.
through at least Day 6 or 7/Sat or Sun, the main driver of severe
potential each day will be mesoscale features tied to prior days
convective evolution, not well resolved at longer time scales. As a
result, predictability is low.

0341 PM CDT Sun Jul 13 2025

Areas affected...Parts of east TX into far southeast OK...northwest
LA...southwest/central AR

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 132041Z - 132245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Storms with locally damaging winds are possible through
the remainder of the afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Some increase in storm coverage and intensity has been
noted within a very moist and strongly buoyant environment across
east-central TX, along a composite outflow to the east of a
well-defined MCV over central TX. Deep-layer shear is relatively
weak, but modest southwesterly low/midlevel flow attendant to the
MCV and further outflow consolidation could result in a
northeastward-moving storm cluster that will move toward the
ArkLaTex region through the remainder of the afternoon. Such a
cluster could be accompanied by isolated damaging winds. Additional
storm development will be possible ahead of this developing cluster
into northeast TX and southwest AR, which may also be capable of
producing localized downbursts.

Mesoscale Discussion 1663
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0338 PM CDT Sun Jul 13 2025

Areas affected...southwestern New Mexico and southeastern Arizona

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 132038Z - 132315Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Storms are expected to increase in coverage and intensity
through the afternoon and into the evening, posing a severe wind
risk.  A severe thunderstorm watch is possible.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorms have initiated over the high terrain this
afternoon across the region.  While moisture is meager for this time
of year, it is sufficient to support 500-1000 J/kg of MLCAPE and
robust updrafts.  The 18Z Tucson sounding represents the
characteristic well-mixed, inverted-V sounding profiles across the
region.  Certainly, this environment will support dry-microburst
potential for the strongest storms.  With northeasterly midlevel
flow expected to increase this afternoon and evening, a more
organized wind threat could develop and move south-southwestward off
the higher terrain.  Convective trends will continue to be monitored
for the possibility of watch issuance.

Areas affected...Parts of central/eastern VA...central MD...the
eastern WV Panhandle

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 131941Z - 132115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated damaging wind remains possible through late
afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Earlier convection across MD and eastern VA has
generated a westward-moving outflow approaching central VA.
Meanwhile, other storms have developed this afternoon along/east of
the Blue Ridge. Deep-layer flow is quite weak across the region,
resulting in generally disorganized storms. However, strong heating
of a very moist airmass (PW around 2 inches) has resulted in MLCAPE
increasing above 3000 J/kg in areas outside of convective outflow.
The large PW and favorable buoyancy will support a threat of
localized wet microbursts, both with storms along the
westward-moving outflow, and the storms moving slowly eastward off
of the Blue Ridge. Outflow collisions may result in brief upticks in
storm intensity through the remainder of the afternoon.

Mesoscale Discussion 1661

0214 PM CDT Sun Jul 13 2025

Areas affected...eastern Florida peninsula

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 131914Z - 132145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms are expected to continue developing and
moving southward through the afternoon posing an isolated damaging
wind threat.  A severe thunderstorm watch is unlikely.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorms continue to develop along the eastern
peninsula of Florida in a very moist and unstable environment. 
While the deep-layer flow/shear is weak (per XMR 15Z sounding),
there does appear to be enhanced north-northwesterly low-level flow
likely associated with the midlevel low off the east coast of
Florida.  As a result, 0-3 km northerly shear is around 20 knots
(per MLB VWP), which is at least modestly supportive of
southward-propagating clusters capable of producing severe, damaging
wind gusts through the afternoon.  The localized, isolated nature of
the threat will preclude watch issuance.
