Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0355 AM CDT Mon Jun 16 2025

Valid 191200Z - 241200Z

...DISCUSSION...
...Thursday/Day 4 and Friday/Day 5...
A mid-level trough is forecast to move into the Northeast on
Thursday, as a cold front advances eastward into the central
Appalachians. Ahead of the front, a moist airmass will be in place.
Moderate instability is expected to develop ahead of the front
across the Carolinas and Mid-Atlantic. As surface temperatures warm
during the day, scattered convective initiation will likely take
place along and ahead of the front. Moderate deep-layer shear and
steep low-level lapse rates should support a severe threat during
the afternoon, with the primary threat being damaging wind gusts.

On Friday, a mid-level ridge is forecast to move eastward across the
northern Plains. Beneath the ridge, a moist airmass will likely be
in place, and moderate instability is expected to develop within
this airmass. Ahead of the ridge, thunderstorm development will be
possible in the upper Mississippi Valley during the afternoon.
Although a severe threat may develop in areas that become moderately
unstable, there is some uncertainty concerning convective coverage
due to the presence of the ridge.

...Saturday/Day 6 to Monday/Day 8...
Mid-level heights are forecast to rise on Saturday and Sunday across
the eastern half of the nation, as a large area of high pressure
dominates. In the western U.S. over the weekend, a mid-level trough
is forecast to move northeastward from the Intermountain West into
the northern High Plains. Ahead of the trough, strong to severe
thunderstorms will be possible Saturday afternoon and evening across
parts of eastern Montana. In spite of the potential, there is still
spatial uncertainty concerning the timing of the trough. The severe
threat is expected to shift northeastward into Canada on Sunday.

On Monday, southwest mid-level flow is forecast over much of the
north-central U.S. Isolated to scattered thunderstorms will be
possible over parts of the northern Plains and upper Mississippi
Valley. An isolated severe threat will again be possible, but there
is considerable uncertainty on any potential scenario.

Mesoscale Discussion 1304
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0349 PM CDT Sun Jun 15 2025

Areas affected...eastern Wyoming into eastern Colorado

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 152049Z - 152245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms expected to increase in coverage with
potential for large hail and damaging wind.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorm activity continues to increase, mainly
along and near the higher terrain/upslope regions, across the Front
Range into portions of eastern Wyoming. The downstream air mass
remains under the influence of strong MLCIN, albeit gradually
weakening along the western fringe. This weakening trend is set to
continue as forcing for ascent increases with a shortwave passage
this afternoon/evening. 

Thunderstorms are likely to form and quickly cluster this evening.
Once uncapped, the downstream air mass is moderately to very
unstable (with MLCAPE around 2000-3500 J/kg). Initially, supercells
capable of large hail and damaging wind will be the main threat
before a transition to linear bowing segments and focus for
potential damaging wind into portions of Nebraska. In the short
term, In addition, deepening cumulus is observed further east across
Cherry County in Nebraska. A supercell or two could emerge within
this region ahead of the main forcing. A watch will likely be needed
to cover these potential threats in the coming hours.

Mesoscale Discussion 1303
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0344 PM CDT Sun Jun 15 2025

Areas affected...Southeast Colorado into eastern New Mexico and far
West Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 152044Z - 152245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Large hail and severe wind gusts are possible with storms
that move off the terrain into southeast Colorado and eastern New
Mexico. A watch is not expected in the short term, but trends will
be monitored into the evening where a more organized wind threat
could evolve farther east.

DISCUSSION...Convection has developed from the Sangre de Cristo into
the southern Rockies this afternoon as moderately moist (mid 50s F
dewpoints) upslope flow has persisted over the last few hours. To
the east, a modifying outflow boundary from an earlier MCS in the
southern Plains has entered eastern New Mexico and should eventually
reach the terrain. While this outflow is slightly cooler, low 60s F
dewpoints have promoted 2000-2500 J/kg MLCAPE with weaker
inhibition. The expectation is for storms to eventually move off the
terrain as MLCIN is eroded in the next hour or two. Modestly
enhanced northwesterlies aloft on the western flank of the MCV atop
southeasterly surface winds supports 35-45 kts of effective shear
(stronger in the north and weaker south). Steep mid-level lapse
rates and strong shear should allow initial supercells to produce
large hail (up to 2.5 inches) as well as severe winds.

Some model guidance has suggested clustering is possible in
northeast New Mexico where stronger shear and greater buoyancy will
overlap. With only a weak low-level jet response in the Texas
Panhandle/South Plains this evening, it is not clear how far east
such a cluster/small MCS could propagate. A greater wind threat
would exist if this occurs. Overall, storm coverage should remain
isolated at least into early evening and a watch is not currently
expected. Trends in convective evolution will need to be monitored
into this evening, however.

Mesoscale Discussion 1302
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0213 PM CDT Sun Jun 15 2025

Areas affected...eastern Montana

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 151913Z - 152115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm development likely to increase over the next
couple of hours with initial supercells capable large to very large
hail and damaging wind.

DISCUSSION...Convective development has begun across the high
terrain in central Montana. This should increased in coverage as a
shortwave rotates out of Idaho into Montana this afternoon/evening
and forcing for ascent increases.

Initially, the moderately unstable and strongly sheared air mass
should support supercells. Given the steep lapse rates and linear
elongated hodographs, these will be capable of large to very large
hail (2-3+ in). Where east to southeasterly flow resides in
east-central/eastern Montana leading to sufficient low level SRH, a
tornado would be possible. 

Evolution through the afternoon should favor clustering and attempts
at upscale growth, to which the primary hazard will likely become
strong to significant damaging wind (some 60-75+ mph). A Severe
Thunderstorm Watch will be needed to cover this threat within the
next couple of hours.

Tropical Storm Dalila Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042025
200 PM MST Sun Jun 15 2025
 
Dalila's convection has collapsed, leaving behind a single
fragmented band of thunderstorms.  Subjective and objective
satellite estimates have lowered this cycle and the initial
intensity has been reduced to 40 kt based on a blend of the TAFB and
SAB Dvorak estimates. Dalila is expected to continue weakening as
the storm moves over cooler waters and into a hostile environment.
The NHC intensity forecast predicts Dalila to become a post-tropical
remnant low later today.
 
The storm is moving west-northwestward at 8 kt and should continue
gradually turning westward in the low-level flow. A more westward
motion is expected in the next day or two until the system
dissipates in a couple of days.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 418
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
215 PM MDT Sun Jun 15 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Central and eastern Montana
  North central Wyoming

* Effective this Sunday afternoon and evening from 215 PM until
  1100 PM MDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 80
    mph likely
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 3
    inches in diameter likely
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms are expected to increase in coverage and
intensity through the afternoon while spreading eastward from the
higher terrain.  The storm environment initially favors supercells
with very large hail (2-3 inch diameter), while upscale growth into
clusters is expected this evening with an increasing threat for
60-80 mph outflow winds.  Favorable storm interactions could also
support an isolated tornado or two this evening.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 100
statute miles north and south of a line from 30 miles west of
Harlowton MT to 10 miles east northeast of Baker MT. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU8).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
3 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 70 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 550. Mean storm motion vector
27020.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0252 PM CDT Sun Jun 15 2025

Valid 152000Z - 161200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS LATER THIS 
AFTERNOON INTO EARLY TONIGHT FROM CENTRAL/EASTERN MONTANA INTO
ADJACENT AREAS OF NORTH DAKOTA...SOUTH DAKOTA AND WYOMING...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms capable of producing large to very
large hail and swaths of severe/damaging gusts (some 75+ mph) are
likely across portions of central/eastern Montana into northeast
Wyoming and the western Dakotas this afternoon through tonight.
Additional strong to severe thunderstorms may occur across the
central/southern Plains, and over parts of Virginia and North
Carolina.

...20z Update...
5% hail/wind risk probabilities were reduced across portions of
central TX in the wake of a decaying MCS. Surface observations over
the past 1-2 hours have largely been sampling 30-55 mph winds with
the convective band with further weakening expected as it becomes
increasingly displaced from stronger mid-level flow. However, a few
strong/severe storms remain possible as the MCS collides with a
northward-propagating sea breeze boundary across eastern TX this
afternoon and migrates into a very buoyant (3000-3500 J/kg MLCAPE)
air mass in place across south-central TX.

A slight expansion of 2% tornado probabilities was made across
south-central SD where shallow cumulus is beginning to develop
within a diffuse warm frontal zone where temperatures are quickly
warming into the upper 80s and low 90s. A few recent CAM solutions
(most notably the RRFS) suggest a supercell or two may develop
within this weakly forced regime between 22-02 UTC. If this occurs,
the environment will support organized supercells with some tornado
risk (in addition to the potential for large hail/severe wind).
Given the recent observed trends, and the HRRR's tendency to
struggle to initiate convection in such weakly forced regimes, some
expansion of tornado risk probabilities appears warranted.

Elsewhere, the forecast remains on track as outlined in the previous
discussion (below). See MCD #1302 for additional short-term details
pertaining to the Enhanced risk across MT.

..Moore.. 06/15/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1128 AM CDT Sun Jun 15 2025/

...MT to SD/NE through tonight...
Moderate buoyancy is expected again this afternoon along and south
of a an outflow-reinforced baroclinic zone, in advance of a midlevel
shortwave trough (now over WA/OR) that will crest the ridge over MT
this evening.  Scattered thunderstorm development is expected in the
zone of ascent along the baroclinic zone and in advance of the
midlevel trough, in concert with the diurnal heating cycle in cloud
breaks.  MLCAPE of 2000-3000 J/kg, steep midlevel lapse rates and
long hodographs will favor supercells with very large hail (2-3
inches in diameter).  Clustering of storms through the evening will
contribute to an increasing threat for severe outflow winds of 60-80
mph as convection spreads eastward toward the SD/ND/MT border region
through tonight.

Farther south into the High Plains, the scenario will be similar to
the previous two days, with a few storm clusters expected to form
east of the higher terrain and spread eastward through late evening.
 Buoyancy/vertical shear will be sufficient for a couple of
supercells with some hail threat, though relatively deep mixing
supports upscale growth on outflow interactions, with an attendant
threat for severe outflow gusts.

An MCV from overnight convection will continue to move
east-southeastward across southeast SD and northwest IA/southwest MN
through this evening.  Morning convection across northwest IA has
weakened, but residual clouds linger.  Some flow enhancement in the
low-midlevels on the south side of the MCV, in combination with
diurnal destabilization in cloud breaks/steep midlevel lapse rates,
could support a cluster of storms with some hail/wind threat later
this afternoon/evening.  Will re-evaluate this corridor this
afternoon, but will maintain MRGL risk given lingering clouds and
some uncertainty regarding the magnitude of destabilization.  

...NW/central TX today...
Merged cold pools with overnight convection in OK continue to spread
southward across western north TX, with a history of occasional
measured gusts near 60 mph.  Daytime heating/destabilization ahead
of the cold pool will result in sufficient destabilization for
storms to continue to develop southward with the cold pool. 
However, vertical shear is weakening with time with the loss of the
nocturnal low-level jet, so convection organization is expected to
slowly diminish over time.  Still, the thermodynamic environment and
the established cold pool (per surface observations and KDYX radar
data) will support the continued potential for occasional
strong-severe outflow gusts toward central TX/parts of the Edwards
Plateau through the afternoon.

...Mid-Atlantic this afternoon/evening...
A front, reinforced by differential heating across southern VA,
appears to be mixing slowly northward and could serve as a focus for
thunderstorm development this afternoon.  Weak enhancement to
low-level shear/hodograph curvature along the boundary could support
weakly rotating storms with the potential to produce a brief tornado
or two.  Otherwise, the main concern will be isolated wind damage
with largely sub-severe winds where low-level lapse rates steepen
this afternoon along and south of the front.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook

0254 PM CDT Sun Jun 15 2025

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF SOUTHERN
NEVADA...SOUTHWESTERN UTAH...AND FAR NORTHWESTERN ARIZONA...

...Southern Nevada, Southwestern Utah and far Northwestern
Arizona...
Modest mid-level flow associated with a progressive upper-level
trough will move into the Great Basin and Southwest Monday. A very
dry, well-mixed boundary layer will support low teens to single
digit relative humidity values across the region. A corridor of
20-30 mph winds are most likely from southern Nevada into
south-central Utah where very low daytime humidity will support
Critical fire weather conditions amid dry fuels.

...Columbia Basin...
The upper-level short wave translating through the Pacific Northwest
Monday will contribute to enhanced downslope winds particularly
across the western portions of the Columbia Basin. West winds of
around 15 mph combined with relative humidity in the 15-25 percent
range will result in elevated fire weather concerns for central
Washington state and Columbia River Gorge where ongoing fire
activity remains.

..Williams.. 06/15/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0156 AM CDT Sun Jun 15 2025/

...Synopsis...
During the day on Monday, a mid-level shortwave trough is expected
to traverse California and into the Great Basin, and the surface
mass response to this feature will tighten the sea-level pressure
gradient across the area, resulting in strong surface winds. With
seasonably strong vertical mixing, RH in the Great Basin and Four
Corners region is expected to be around 5-15%. The best overlap of
windy conditions and dry fuels is expected to be across parts of
southeast Nevada, southwest Utah, and far northwest Arizona, where
Critical highlights have been added. In this area, winds are
expected to be near 20-30 mph with gusts as high as 35-40 mph
underneath the core of the mid-level jet associated with the
shortwave trough. Surrounding that Critical area, winds may be
weaker and fuels less receptive to fire spread. However, this still
warrants an Elevated area across parts of the Great Basin and Four
Corners region.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0228 PM CDT Sun Jun 15 2025

Valid 171200Z - 181200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM CENTRAL
INTO EASTERN KANSAS...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms with large hail, damaging winds, and isolated
tornadoes are possible Tuesday across parts of the central Plains
and mid Missouri Valley.

...Synopsis...
A shortwave trough will move east across the upper Great Lakes, with
a cold front from parts of lower MI extending southwestward into KS.
Meanwhile, a larger/low-amplitude trough will continue moving across
the Rockies and to the high Plans by 00Z. Low pressure forecast to
develop over the TX/OK Panhandles, with a dryline extending
southward into northwest TX.

A large area of strong instability will exist over much of KS, MO,
OK and AR, with MUCAPE of 4000-5000 J/kg possible, supporting
significant damaging winds, locally significant hail and a couple
tornadoes.

...Central Plains...
Indications are that an MCS or remnants will affect NE into northern
or eastern KS early on Tuesday. Given strong destabilization east of
this potential activity, a damaging wind risk could persist into
parts of IA and MO.

Later in the day, the air mass south and west of any such convective
system (or residual outflow) will become very unstable. While
capping will limit southward development, over OK and the
Panhandles, hot temperatures and southwest flow across those regions
will combine with mid 70s F dewpoints over KS yielding late
afternoon and evening storms. Slow-moving supercells will be
possible initially, especially near any old outflows where SRH will
be maximized. Both tornadoes and very large hail will be possible.
Otherwise, an increasing southwest low-level jet to 50 kt will
support a severe MCS across KS and perhaps into western MO late.
Damaging and potentially destructive wind gusts may occur.

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM PARTS OF
MINNESOTA INTO NEBRASKA...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe storms with areas of damaging winds and hail are
forecast on Monday from the north-central High Plains into the upper
Mississippi Valley.

...Synopsis...
An early shortwave trough associated with an MCS will move east out
of ND across northern MN during the day, with modest westerlies
aloft behind it over the central Plains to northern Rockies. Height
falls will occur behind the northern wave as it breaks down the
antecedent ridge. Midlevel temperatures will generally be cool with
around -10 C at 500 mb.

At the surface, a trough will exist from northern MN near the
convective system southwestward across NE. Sufficient moisture will
exist behind this boundary across MT and WY for afternoon storms,
with a nocturnal low-level jet aiding overnight development further
across much of NE.

...MN/IA/SD...
An MCS is likely to be ongoing Monday morning from ND into northern
MN, with associated midlevel wave. As this feature continues east
during the day, a conditional threat of supercells will develop
along the southern periphery, even if only an MCV by afternoon.
Here, a low-level lapse rate plume will develop out of the
southwest. A couple tornadoes may occur along with large hail.
Additional isolated cells will be possible trailing southwestward
across southern MN, northern IA, and perhaps southeast SD and
northeast NE. In favor of large hail potential will be strong
instability with > 3000 J/kg MUCAPE, however, deep-layer shear
appears less than optimal, suggesting more of a localized sig hail
threat. Otherwise, enhanced low-level shear near along the southern
periphery of the MCS/MCV influence may yield tornado potential.

...MT/WY/NE...
Strong heating and gradual cooling aloft will steepen lapse rates
and favor scattered cells capable of hail and wind from southern MT
across much of eastern WY during the afternoon. Additional cells may
develop over the Black Hills. With time, an MCS is likely to
develop, with strong to severe gusts over much of western into
central NE. A deep boundary layer and hot temperatures preceding the
MCS will likely aid evaporation/downdraft potential, with southwest
850 mb wind favoring propagation.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1152 AM CDT Sun Jun 15 2025

Valid 151700Z - 161200Z

Dry downslope flow east of the Sierra Crest along with dry fuels
will contribute to elevated fire weather conditions across far
western Nevada this afternoon. Single digit relative humidity along
with breezy southwest winds are expected across central/southern
Nevada and southwestern Utah. However, mid and upper slope
fuelscapes remain largely in green up phase, limiting fire spread
potential to lower elevation cured grasses with average fuel
loading.

..Williams.. 06/15/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0156 AM CDT Sun Jun 15 2025/

...Synopsis...
A belt of modest mid-level flow will be positioned over the Great
Basin during the day, and strong mixing during the afternoon is
expected to bring some of that flow to the surface, resulting in a
couple areas of fire weather concerns. An Elevated area was
maintained across parts of northwestern Nevada, where RH is expected
to be near 5-15% with 15-20 mph surface winds atop dry fuels.
Similar atmospheric conditions are expected across eastern Nevada
into west-central Utah, however fuels in this region are not as dry.
Therefore, have held off on introducing Elevated highlights in this
area for now.

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS LATER THIS
AFTERNOON INTO EARLY TONIGHT FROM CENTRAL/EASTERN MONTANA INTO
ADJACENT AREAS OF NORTH DAKOTA...SOUTH DAKOTA AND WYOMING...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms capable of producing large to very
large hail and swaths of severe/damaging gusts (some 75+ mph) are
likely across portions of central/eastern Montana into northeast
Wyoming and the western Dakotas this afternoon through tonight.
Additional strong to severe thunderstorms may occur across the
central/southern Plains, and over parts of Virginia and North
Carolina.

...MT to SD/NE through tonight...
Moderate buoyancy is expected again this afternoon along and south
of a an outflow-reinforced baroclinic zone, in advance of a midlevel
shortwave trough (now over WA/OR) that will crest the ridge over MT
this evening.  Scattered thunderstorm development is expected in the
zone of ascent along the baroclinic zone and in advance of the
midlevel trough, in concert with the diurnal heating cycle in cloud
breaks.  MLCAPE of 2000-3000 J/kg, steep midlevel lapse rates and
long hodographs will favor supercells with very large hail (2-3
inches in diameter).  Clustering of storms through the evening will
contribute to an increasing threat for severe outflow winds of 60-80
mph as convection spreads eastward toward the SD/ND/MT border region
through tonight.

Farther south into the High Plains, the scenario will be similar to
the previous two days, with a few storm clusters expected to form
east of the higher terrain and spread eastward through late evening.
 Buoyancy/vertical shear will be sufficient for a couple of
supercells with some hail threat, though relatively deep mixing
supports upscale growth on outflow interactions, with an attendant
threat for severe outflow gusts. 

...Southeast SD/northwest IA/southwest MN this afternoon/evening...
An MCV from overnight convection will continue to move
east-southeastward across southeast SD and northwest IA/southwest MN
through this evening.  Morning convection across northwest IA has
weakened, but residual clouds linger.  Some flow enhancement in the
low-midlevels on the south side of the MCV, in combination with
diurnal destabilization in cloud breaks/steep midlevel lapse rates,
could support a cluster of storms with some hail/wind threat later
this afternoon/evening.  Will re-evaluate this corridor this
afternoon, but will maintain MRGL risk given lingering clouds and
some uncertainty regarding the magnitude of destabilization.  

...NW/central TX today...
Merged cold pools with overnight convection in OK continue to spread
southward across western north TX, with a history of occasional
measured gusts near 60 mph.  Daytime heating/destabilization ahead
of the cold pool will result in sufficient destabilization for
storms to continue to develop southward with the cold pool. 
However, vertical shear is weakening with time with the loss of the
nocturnal low-level jet, so convection organization is expected to
slowly diminish over time.  Still, the thermodynamic environment and
the established cold pool (per surface observations and KDYX radar
data) will support the continued potential for occasional
strong-severe outflow gusts toward central TX/parts of the Edwards
Plateau through the afternoon.

...Mid-Atlantic this afternoon/evening...
A front, reinforced by differential heating across southern VA,
appears to be mixing slowly northward and could serve as a focus for
thunderstorm development this afternoon.  Weak enhancement to
low-level shear/hodograph curvature along the boundary could support
weakly rotating storms with the potential to produce a brief tornado
or two.  Otherwise, the main concern will be isolated wind damage
with largely sub-severe winds where low-level lapse rates steepen
this afternoon along and south of the front.

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE NORTHERN PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms capable of producing large to very
large hail and swaths of severe/damaging gusts (some 75+ mph) are
likely across portions of central/eastern Montana into northeast
Wyoming and the western Dakotas this afternoon through tonight.
Additional strong to severe thunderstorms may occur across the
central/southern Plains, and over parts of Virginia and North
Carolina.

...Northern/Central Plains...
Ongoing thunderstorms across northeast MT may pose an isolated hail
threat this morning. Otherwise, upper ridging will continue to
prevail over the Southwest and southern Rockies today, with a subtle
mid-level shortwave trough forecast to advance northeastward across
the northern Rockies and adjacent High Plains through the period.
This feature will likely aid in the development of initially
high-based convection over parts of the northern Rockies in MT by
early to mid afternoon. Meanwhile, diurnal heating of a fairly moist
low-level airmass (surface dewpoints generally in the mid to upper
50s) and steep mid-level lapse rates will foster around 2000-3000
J/kg of MLCAPE through the afternoon across much of central/eastern
MT along and south of a convectively reinforced boundary. Modest
low-level east-southeasterly flow will veer to west-southwesterly
and strengthen with height through mid/upper levels. This will
support around 40-50 kt of effective bulk shear and organized
convection.

Intense thunderstorm development appears increasingly likely across
central MT by mid to late afternoon, as large-scale ascent
associated with the shortwave trough overspreads the surface warm
sector. Given the rather favorable thermodynamic/kinematic
environment expected, initial convection will likely be
supercellular and pose a threat for large to very large hail
potentially up to 2-3 inches in diameter. The Enhanced Risk has been
expanded westward some in central MT to account for this expected
supercell development, and a 30% area has been included for large
hail as well. With time this evening, one or more clusters will
likely evolve from the initially discrete activity across eastern MT
into parts of northeast WY and the western Dakotas. Steepened
low-level lapse rates should aid in efficient mixing of intense
downdraft winds to the surface, and swaths of severe/damaging winds
should occur as thunderstorms spread eastward through the evening
and into early Monday morning. Some of these winds may be
significant, with peak gusts potentially reaching up to 70-80 mph on
an isolated basis.

Isolated to scattered high-based thunderstorms should develop along
the surface trough/dryline within a moist low-level upslope flow
regime across portions of southeast WY into eastern CO, and perhaps
persisting into western NE/KS. This activity will pose a risk of
strong to severe outflow winds given a deeply mixed boundary layer
and the presence of very steep low-level lapse rates. Isolated hail
may also occur where any robust updrafts can be maintained within a
modestly sheared environment.

...Southern Plains...
Extensive, loosely organized convection is ongoing this morning
across much of western/southern OK and vicinity. This activity is
being aided by modest low-level warm moist advection associated with
a 20-30 kt southwesterly low-level jet. Current expectations are for
these thunderstorms to generally weaken through the rest of the
morning as the low-level jet gradually weakens. Even so, an isolated
threat for strong/gusty winds may persist with these clusters as
they spread generally south-southeastward. There may be some chance
for either this morning convection or related outflow to regenerate
new, robust convection this afternoon across parts of TX. Have
expanded the Marginal Risk for wind southward a bit to account for
this potential, but in general weak shear should limit convective
organization with southward extent. Otherwise, an isolated severe
threat may exist with convection that develops across AR this
afternoon in proximity to a remnant MCV, and along/east of the
surface lee trough/dryline across the southern High Plains.

...Virginia/North Carolina...
A low-amplitude mid-level shortwave trough will move eastward across
the central/southern Appalachians today. A related weak surface low
should develop eastward near the NC/VA border through the afternoon.
A moist and unstable airmass will likely be in place across much of
NC and southern VA as filtered daytime heating occurs. Poor lapse
rates aloft and modest deep-layer shear should limit the overall
severe potential across this region. Still, isolated wet microbursts
and/or marginally severe hail may occur with the stronger
updrafts/cores that can develop this afternoon and early evening.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM MST (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Dalila was 
located near latitude 18.1 North, longitude 107.4 West. Dalila is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h). This general 
motion is expected during the next couple days, as Dalila moves 
farther away from the southwestern coast of Mexico.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 60 mph (95 km/h) with 
higher gusts. Steady weakening is forecast during the next couple of 
days, with the system becoming a post-tropical remnant low tonight 
or Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 996 mb (29.42 inches).

Tropical Storm Dalila Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042025
200 AM MST Sun Jun 15 2025
 
Dalila is likely near its peak intensity, with little change in
organization evident since the previous advisory package. The latest
subjective Dvorak intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB were 65
knots and 55 knots, respectively. Objective estimates ranged from
45 to 57 knots, while an ASCAT pass earlier in the day showed
numerous 50 knot wind barbs. Based on a blend of these data, the
initial intensity for this advisory has been held at 55 knots.
 
Dalila is now heading toward the west-northwest, or 285/12 knots. A
turn toward the west is expected during the next day or so, as 
Dalila is steered by a mid-level ridge over northern Mexico and the 
southwest U.S. A westward to slightly south of due west motion is 
then forecast through dissipation as Dalila moves over much
cooler waters. The current forecast shows Dalila becoming a
post-tropical remnant low in a day or so, and dissipating by 
Tuesday. The latest track forecast is very close to that of the 
previous advisory, and is close to the track consensus aids.

Dalila should begin to weaken later today as some drier mid-level
air evident in water vapor imagery begins to impact the system.  
More steady weakening is then likely as the system moves
over much cooler water and into a progressively drier mid-level
environment. The latest intensity forecast is close to the previous
advisory and in good agreement with the intensity consensus
guidance.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. The outer bands of Tropical Storm Dalila will bring locally heavy 
rainfall to the Mexican states of Michoacán and Guerrero through 
this morning. Scattered areas of flooding and mudslides are 
expected, especially in areas of steep terrain near the coast.
 
2. Dalila is expected to produce tropical-storm-force winds across
portions of the warning area during the next few hours.  Winds 
will diminish today while the system moves farther offshore of the 
coast of southwestern Mexico.
