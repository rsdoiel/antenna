Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0639 AM CST Wed Dec 11 2024

Valid 111300Z - 121200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM THE EASTERN
CAROLINAS TO SOUTHERN NEW ENGLAND...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorm winds and a few tornadoes are possible from the
eastern Carolinas to southern New England.  Isolated severe
thunderstorms may occur southward into portions of Florida.

...Synopsis...
Moisture-channel imagery showed a substantial mid/upper trough
extending from a cyclone over the MB/ON border southward over the
Mississippi Valley to a strong, basal shortwave trough over portions
of MS/LA.  The latter feature is forecast to pivot eastward to the
TN Valley and FL Panhandle through 18Z, then turn northeastward
across WV, western VA and the west-central Carolinas by 00Z.  As
that occurs, the entire synoptic trough will become more negatively
tilted, with preceding speed maxima of 160-180-kt at 250 mb, 110-125
kt at 500 mb, and 70-85 kt at 700 mb over parts of the Atlantic
Coast States.

A cold front precedes the main mid/upper trough, and was analyzed at
11Z from east-central PA over western VA to a weak low near AVL,
then across central/southwestern GA and the west-central FL
Panhandle, to the central Gulf.  The front should sweep eastward
across VA, the Carolinas, GA and most of FL today, with a 00Z
position progged from VT across western Long Island, over Atlantic
waters to near or just offshore HSE, then southwestward over more of
the Atlantic to southeastern FL.  The front should proceed offshore
from the remaining Atlantic Coast by around 12Z tomorrow. 

...East Coast States...
An ongoing, prefrontal band of convection, with scattered to widely
scattered embedded thunderstorms, was apparent in radar, satellite
and lightning data from the northeastern Gulf northeastward across
the FL Big Bend region and southern/eastern GA.  This activity
should proceed eastward across much of FL and offshore from GA
today, with isolated potential for damaging to severe gusts and/or a
tornado, as it encounters foregoing diabatic surface destabilization
and boundary-layer theta-e advection.  The main changes this cycle
are to the associated "marginal area, to:
1.  Trim on the southwest edge in deference to ongoing convective
trends (faster than earlier guidance), and 
2.  Add somewhat more of central/southwestern FL to the
5%-wind/Marginal area to give the trailing part of the main squall
line more room to weaken, as diurnal heating of a moist airmass
somewhat offsets weakening trends in both large-scale and frontal
forcings.

Meanwhile, the most dense potential for damaging to severe gusts is
expected to develop farther north today across central/eastern parts
of the Carolinas, northeastward along the coast into southern New
England.  As the shortwave and synoptic troughs assume negative
tilt, synoptic to frontal-scale lift will increase and overlap,
resulting in a narrow band of convection (some with lightning, but
potentially a majority without) firming up into the Mid-Atlantic and
perhaps southern New England.  The aforementioned deep-layer wind
maxima will contribute to fast embedded cell motions and downward
momentum transfer within this band.  Intense associated gusts
sporadically should penetrate a deeply near-neutral to slightly
above moist-adiabatic layer of lapse rates -- with a shallow
near-surface absolutely stable layer possible -- from around the
Delmarva region northeastward, beneath MUCAPE of around 300-800
J/kg.  Buoyancy will become more surface-based with southern extent
from southeastern VA southward, with the greatest values of
low-level shear/SRH and largest hodographs expected over eastern NC
in and near the area of relatively peaked tornado probabilities. 
Line-embedded supercells and/or QLCS mesovortices will be the main
tornado concern, with the wind threat more generalized to any
sustained, bow/LEWP segments within the line.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Low-end fire weather potential is noted for Thursday across the
southern Plains and parts of the Southwest, but unsupportive fuel
conditions should moderate the overall fire weather threat. A cold
continental air mass will continue to overspread the eastern CONUS
in the wake of Wednesday's cold frontal passage with surface high
pressure building from the upper MS River Valley into the Southeast
states. Across the West, a more progressive, less-amplified upper
regime will begin to emerge with a shortwave trough migrating into
the lower Great Basin by late Thursday. This will promote surface
pressure falls across NV/UT with an uptick in low-level winds.

...Southern Plains...
The surface high over the Southeast coupled with weak lee troughing
along the southern High Plains should promote a dry return flow
regime across TX and much of OK Thursday afternoon. Areas of 15-20
mph winds with RH reductions into the 20-30% range appear probable
based on latest ensemble guidance. While areas of elevated fire
weather conditions may emerge, fuels across the region do not
support fire spread after recent precipitation and/or cool
temperatures. 

...Southern NV into AZ...
The low-level mass response across the Great Basin will induce
southerly winds across southern CA, NV, and much of AZ. Trajectories
emanating out of southern CA/AZ (where single-digit dewpoint values
are noted in recent surface observations) will advect dry air
northward coincident with 15-20 mph winds. Elevated to locally
critical fire weather conditions appear possible - especially along
and north of the Mogollon Rim into far southern NV. But as with the
southern Plains, latest fuel guidance shows ERCs are relatively
modest (between the 60-80th percentile), which should modulate the
overall fire threat and precludes highlights at this time (though
fuel trends will continue to be monitored).

...DISCUSSION...
Medium-range guidance is in good agreement that a deep upper trough
will be over much of the central and eastern CONUS early
D4/Wednesday morning. At the same time, a surface low is forecast to
be over eastern PA, with an attendant cold front extending
southwestward from this low across the central Carolinas,
southeastern GA, and northern FL.

A shortwave trough is forecast to move within the larger upper
troughing, moving from the TN Valley/Southeast through the
Mid-Atlantic on D4/Wednesday. This evolution will help induce a more
negative tilt to the parent troughing while encouraging an eastward
shift and deamplification as well. The cold front will also quickly
shift eastward off the East Coast. A fairly narrow warm sector may
precede this front, but poor lapse rates will limit instability.
This low buoyancy will counter the strong shear expected, resulting
in mostly weak updrafts and tempering any severe potential.

Stable conditions are expected across the CONUS on D5/Thursday as
high pressure shifts from the northern Plains into the OH Valley.
Some modest moisture return may potentially begin across TX on
D6/Friday ahead of a low-amplitude, southern-stream shortwave trough
expected to move across the southern Plains late D6/Friday and early
D7/Saturday. Guidance varies on the strength and speed of this wave,
limiting predictability, but some thunderstorms are possible across
central/east TX and LA late D6/Friday and early D7/Saturday as this
wave interacts with the return moisture.
