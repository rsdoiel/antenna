Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0707 AM CDT Sun Jun 08 2025

Valid 081300Z - 091200Z

...THERE IS A MODERATE RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON
AND EVENING FROM THE EASTERN TEXAS PANHANDLE INTO SOUTHERN OKLAHOMA
AND NORTHWEST/NORTH-CENTRAL TEXAS...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON
FROM THE MID-ATLANTIC REGION INTO GEORGIA....

...SUMMARY...
A severe weather outbreak is possible across the southern Plains
today. A few tornadoes, destructive wind gusts of 80-100 mph, and
giant hail up to 5 inches in diameter are likely. Strong gusts, and
perhaps a couple of tornadoes, are also possible along portions of
the East Coast.

...OK/TX...
Broad west-northwesterly flow is present today across the
central/southern Plains states, with a surface cold front sagging
southward across KS.  Ahead of the front, a very moist
boundary-layer air mass is in place across much of OK and TX, with
dewpoints in the upper 60s and lower 70s.  Strong daytime heating
and near dry-adiabatic low/mid-level lapse rates will yield a large
reservoir of extremely high CAPE values across western OK and
northwest TX.  

Rapid development of intense thunderstorms will ensue by mid/late
afternoon along the cold front over northwest OK and along a complex
dryline structure over the eastern TX Panhandle.  Strong deep layer
shear will favor supercells, despite rather weak low-level winds. 
Very large hail, damaging winds, and a few tornadoes will be
possible as these storms track southeastward across western/central
OK and congeal into one or more bowing segments.  Recent CAM
solutions suggest pockets of deep boundary-layer mixing, with some
areas heating into the mid 90s while dewpoints drop into the 50s. 
If this scenario develops, significant wind and hail would remain a
concern, but the overall risk of tornadoes would be reduced.

The risk of widespread destructive winds will increase through the
evening as the convective complex tracks into northwest and
north-central TX.  The activity make remain intense as far east as
northern/central LA tonight.

...Central/North TX early afternoon...
A cluster of strong thunderstorms is ongoing this morning between
ABI and LBB.  Other isolated cells are forming in eastern NM north
of TCC.  Given the very unstable environment, any one of these
clusters of storms could potentially persist through the day and
track southeastward into parts of central TX.  Large hail and
damaging winds would be the main concerns.

...Mid Atlantic Region...
A shortwave trough currently over OH will track eastward today, with
large-scale ascent overspreading the Mid-Atlantic states by
afternoon.  A moist surface air mass is present across much of
VA/MD/NC and vicinity with dewpoints in the upper 60s.  Persistent
clouds and weak mid-level lapse rates will limit destabilization. 
However, it appears likely that storms will develop off the Blue
Ridge by mid afternoon and spread eastward toward the coast. 
Forecast soundings show sufficient low and deep layer shear for
supercell structures capable of damaging wind gusts and perhaps a
few tornadoes.

...GA/SC...
A large MCS has persisted overnight across parts of AL/GA, with a
few strong storms along its leading edge.  Given a few hours of
daytime heating, these storms may pose a risk of damaging wind gusts
as they spread eastward toward the coast.

PUBLIC SEVERE WEATHER OUTLOOK  
NWS STORM PREDICTION CENTER NORMAN OK
0409 AM CDT SUN JUN 08 2025

...Severe thunderstorms expected over parts of the southern Plains
later today and tonight...

* LOCATIONS...
  North Texas
  Southern Oklahoma

* HAZARDS...
  Widespread damaging winds, some hurricane force
  A couple of tornadoes
  Scattered large hail, some baseball size

* SUMMARY...
  A severe weather outbreak is possible across the southern Plains
  today. A few tornadoes, destructive wind gusts of 80-100 mph,
  and giant hail up to 5 inches in diameter are likely.

Preparedness actions...

Review your severe weather safety procedures for the possibility
of dangerous weather today. Stay tuned to NOAA Weather Radio,
weather.gov, or other media for watches and warnings. A watch
means that conditions are favorable for severe thunderstorms
over the next several hours. If a severe thunderstorm warning is
issued for your area, move to a place of safety, ideally in an 
interior room on the lowest floor of a sturdy building.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0347 AM CDT Sun Jun 08 2025

Valid 111200Z - 161200Z

...DISCUSSION...
Guidance trends remain supportive of a more active pattern across
the northern High Plains to the Upper Midwest. GEFS-based ML
guidance from SPC and NSSL are now highlighting multiple days with
mesoscale areas of 15 percent probabilities, mainly over the
northern High Plains. Western Gulf moisture will spread north and
encompass much of the central states through next weekend. Various
shortwave impulses ejecting into the Northwest may support multiple
bouts of mesoscale-driven severe potential downstream along the
northern periphery of the expansive Great Plains buoyancy plume. The
initial impulse that is expected to reach northern CA by 12Z
Wednesday has poor predictability with its downstream evolution into
the North-Central States.

Low-probability severe potential may persist for several days with a
minor southern-stream shortwave impulse drifting east from the
southern Great Plains. This could foster daily mesoscale corridors
with a severe threat, as modest shear overlaps plentiful buoyancy
initially over the South-Central States.

Tropical Storm Barbara Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP022025
300 AM CST Sun Jun 08 2025
 
Showers and thunderstorms have become better organized in 
association with an area of low pressure located offshore of 
southwestern Mexico. A small, persistent area of deep convection has 
been observed in satellite images tonight, and recent scatterometer 
data confirm this has led to the formation of a well-defined, closed 
low-level circulation. Therefore, the NHC is starting advisories on 
Tropical Storm Barbara with an initial intensity of 40 kt based on 
the earlier scatterometer winds.

Barbara is currently within a moist and relatively low shear 
environment over warm waters. So, strengthening is expected during 
the next day or so, and this could occur quickly given recent 
satellite trends and the small size of the storm. The official NHC 
forecast shows Barbara becoming a hurricane in 24 h, which is 
supported by HAFS-A/B and the HFIP corrected consensus (HCCA). The 
window for strengthening is brief, as Barbara is forecast to move 
over cooler waters and into a drier mid-level environment by 48 h. 
This should disrupt the convective structure of the storm and result 
in weakening. By day 5, the remnant low of Barbara is forecast to 
either dissipate or become absorbed by the circulation of EP91.

Barbara is moving west-northwestward (295/10 kt) on the south side 
of a mid-level ridge, and this motion should continue over the next 
couple of days. For this time period, the NHC forecast generally 
lies near or between the simple and corrected consensus aids. Given 
the forecast track and wind radii, tropical-storm-force winds 
are not expected to affect the southwestern coast of Mexico. By 
Tuesday, the track forecast becomes more complicated given the 
potential for binary interaction between Barbara and another 
disturbance (EP91) with a high chance of formation. Because of this, 
the long-range track forecast could be subject to larger future 
adjustments depending on the evolution of EP91.

SUMMARY OF 300 AM CST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...15.2N 102.4W
ABOUT 180 MI...290 KM SSW OF ZIHUATANEJO MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...45 MPH...75 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 295 DEGREES AT 12 MPH...19 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1001 MB...29.56 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 AM CST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Barbara was 
located near latitude 15.2 North, longitude 102.4 West. Barbara is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h), and this 
motion is expected to continue for the next couple of days. A turn 
toward the west at a slower forward speed is anticipated on Tuesday.
 
Satellite-derived wind data indicate that maximum sustained winds 
are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts. Strengthening is 
forecast during the next day or so, and Barbara is forecast to 
become a hurricane on Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches, with localized amounts
up to 6 inches, are possible across portions of the Mexican states
of Guerrero, Michoacan, Colima, and Jalisco through Monday. This
rainfall may lead to areas of flooding and mudslides.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Tropical Storm Barbara, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep2.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Barbara will affect portions of the coast
of southwestern Mexico during the next few days. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will traverse the eastern U.S. while upper
ridging remains in place west of the Rockies tomorrow (Monday). A
combination of either recent rainfall over the past week (hence
dampened fuels), rich low-level moisture, or forecast
showers/thunderstorms, should limit significant wildfire-spread
potential over most locales over the CONUS. With seasonal mid-level
moisture overspreading the Great Basin toward the Pacific Northwest,
thunderstorms chances will increase during the afternoon. Along the
northernmost periphery the richer mid-level moisture, some
potentially dry thunderstorms may develop over southern Oregon.
However, fuel receptiveness is modest at best in this region, and
the potential for dry thunderstorms appears too locally confined
(given the fuel status) to warrant isolated dry thunderstorm
highlights this outlook.

Mesoscale Discussion 1182
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0341 PM CDT Sat Jun 07 2025

Areas affected...portions of eastern Missouri and southern Illinois

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 072041Z - 072245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...A few damaging gusts and instances of marginally severe
hail are possible across portions of eastern Missouri and southern
Illinois this afternoon. A watch is not anticipated.

DISCUSSION...An MCV is currently centered northwest of Columbia, MO
with some convection ongoing along a trailing surface boundary to
the south. Clouds have cleared to the south of the vortex with some
heating and modification of the earlier outflow from convection
across the Mid-South. As such, a pocket of 1000-1500 J/kg MLCAPE has
developed in the region along with strong deep-layer shear. RAP
forecast soundings show a warm nose around 750 mb, which has
generally suppressed convective development away from surface
boundaries. Given strong flow aloft, some damaging gusts are
possible with this activity if downdrafts are strong enough to
transfer that momentum to the surface, though this may be inhibited
by the aforementioned warm nose aloft and generally poor low-level
lapse rates. Some marginally severe hail is also possible given
straight hodographs with the cellular activity, though poor
mid-level lapse rates (6 C/km per mesoanalysis) may limit the
overall hail potential.

Mesoscale Discussion 1181
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0339 PM CDT Sat Jun 07 2025

Areas affected...Parts of northeastern NM into the far western TX/OK
Panhandles

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 072039Z - 072145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...The severe risk, including isolated large hail and locally
severe gusts, could spread southeastward into this evening. The area
is being monitored for a possible watch.

DISCUSSION...An isolated thunderstorm has recently intensified over
the Raton Mesa. Ahead of this storm, visible satellite imagery shows
a band of shallow cumulus extending west-northwestward from the TX
Panhandle -- which generally highlights the lower/middle 60s
dewpoints and related moderate surface-based instability. If this
isolated storm can persist southeastward through this corridor, a
long/straight hodograph (40-50 kt of effective shear) would support
one or more discrete supercells capable of producing large hail and
locally severe gusts. The area is being monitored for a possible
watch.

0324 PM CDT Sat Jun 07 2025

Areas affected...Parts of northeast AL...northwest GA...and
southeast TN

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 385...386...

Valid 072024Z - 072200Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 385, 386
continues.

SUMMARY...The severe-wind risk continues with an MCS tracking
eastward across northeastern AL, northwestern GA, and southeastern
TN.

DISCUSSION...A NNE/SSW-oriented MCS is tracking eastward across
parts of northeastern AL and southern Middle TN into northwestern GA
and southeastern TN this afternoon. This system has been associated
with a swath of wind damage focused over north-central AL. Around
30-40 kt of 0-6km shear (per nearby VWPs) oriented perpendicular to
the leading gust front and warm/moist pre-convective inflow should
support the maintenance of the MCS with eastward extent. The primary
concern continues to be damaging wind gusts, with embedded/localized
gusts upwards of 60-75 mph possible in any small bowing segments
and/or mesovorticies.

Mesoscale Discussion 1179
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0302 PM CDT Sat Jun 07 2025

Areas affected...Eastern North Dakota...Northeastern South
Dakota...and Northwestern Minnesota

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 072002Z - 072200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...A few severe gusts and marginally severe hail reports are
possible this afternoon and evening across parts of eastern North
Dakota, northeastern South Dakota, and northwestern Minnesota. A
watch is not anticipated.

DISCUSSION...Water vapor imagery and RAP analyses show a strong
shortwave trough moving southeastward out of Canada and into the
northern Plains, and this in tandem with a surface cold front has
provided the lift for convective development across parts of central
North Dakota. Ahead of this front, the air mass is cut off from the
rich low-level moisture by convection to the south, and as such,
surface dewpoints across the region are generally in the low to mid
50s F. Large-scale lift has resulted in enough mid-level cooling for
a narrow CAPE axis along the front, and this should continue to
track eastward with the mid-level trough this afternoon and evening.


Despite the lackluster low-level flow noted on regional VWPs, this
relatively dry boundary layer may result in a few strong-severe
gusts, particularly as storms cluster and cold pools merge with
time. Additionally, given a deep CAPE profile, modest mid-level
lapse rates, and weak low-level shear due to veered surface flow, a
few marginally severe hail reports are possible with the initial
activity. The hail threat is expected to gradually decrease with
time. Due to the expected sparse coverage of severe wind and hail, a
watch is not anticipated.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0351 PM CDT Sat Jun 07 2025

Valid 091200Z - 151200Z

Subtropical ridging over the western U.S. is forecast to briefly
intensify Day 3/Monday into Day 4/Tuesday before it begins to break
down later Day 4/Tuesday as mid-level troughing re-develops across
the West and persists into next weekend.  

...Northwest: Day 4/Tuesday - Day 5/Wednesday...
Dry and breezy conditions are expected to develop along/east of the
Cascades Day 4/Tuesday and Day 5/Wednesday across portions of
Washington and Oregon. While elevated to locally critical fire
weather conditions are possible, probabilities for Critical
conditions currently remains less than 40% due to continued
run-to-run ensemble model variability. 

...Great Basin into the Southwest: Day 5/Wednesday - Day
8/Saturday...
Dry and windy conditions are forecast to develop over the western
U.S. by mid-week as the aforementioned western U.S. trough impinges
on the area. While some increase in fire weather conditions is
expected from mid-week into next weekend, especially considering
several preceding days of dry/windy conditions, uncertainty
currently remains a bit too large to introduce probabilities for
Critical fire weather conditions. At this time, ensemble guidance
suggests elevated to locally critical conditions are most likely
across portions of Utah and Nevada. 

...Dry Thunderstorms: Northwest into the northern Great Basin and
northern Rockies...
Thunderstorm potential will increase across the Northwest Day
3/Monday before shifting into the Great Basin and northern Rockies
Day 4/Tuesday through much of the extended period. While dry
thunderstorms will be possible, uncertainty on coverage, mode (wet
vs dry), and fuel receptiveness precludes introducing an area at
this time.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0259 PM CDT Sat Jun 07 2025

Valid 072000Z - 081200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PARTS OF
THE SOUTHEASTERN US...

...SUMMARY...
An organized/bowing line of storms will move across parts of the
Southeast and southern Appalachians this evening with the potential
for corridors of wind damage and a tornado or two.  Other areas of
severe storms will be possible in the wake of this morning's storms
from Mississippi westward to Texas, and across parts of the southern
High Plains and Ozarks.

...20z Update Southeast and Tennessee Valley...
The ongoing MCS across the Southeast has steadily matured this
afternoon with numerous reports of wind damage across Alabama and
Mississippi. These storms will likely continue to pose a risk for
damaging gusts and an isolated tornado as they move eastward into
the southern Appalachians this evening/tonight. The primary change
with the outlook was to trim the Enhanced and Slight Risks behind
the cold pool. Continued heating and air mass recovery immediately
behind these storms may support some redevelopment along the western
edge of the trailing outflow from the ArkLaTex to Mississippi
tonight. Recent HRRR guidance suggests a few clusters of severe
storms may redevelop and spread eastward tonight with a risk for
occasional hail and damaging gusts.

...West-Central Texas, the Panhandle to Red River vicinity...
In the wake of morning convection now over the Southeast, robust
surface heating/mixing along and south of the remnant outflow and
synoptic front could be sufficient to support isolated thunderstorm
development this evening. Additional isolated storms are possible
near the dryline/outflow intersection across central Texas and the
southeastern Texas Panhandle. While confidence in storm development
is not overly high, owing to modest forcing for ascent and residual
capping, moderate to large buoyancy and deep-layer shear could
support splitting supercells capable of large to very large hail and
damaging outflow gusts this evening. Will maintain the level 2
Slight Risk and expand it westward for potential storm
development/intensification across west-central and western North
Texas this evening.

Otherwise, the prior outlook remains unchanged. Isolated severe
storms are possible across parts of the Ozarks ahead of a remnant
MCV. Damaging gusts are the most probable hazard. Additional
isolated storms are possible over the northern Plains ahead of the
cold front. See the prior discussion for more information.

..Lyons.. 06/07/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1130 AM CDT Sat Jun 07 2025/

...Mid-South into the Southeast through tonight...
Ahead of a midlevel shortwave trough over the lower MO Valley, an
MCS and associated MCV are moving eastward across the Mid-South. 
Per modified 12z soundings, as surface temperatures warm into the
80s, MLCAPE will exceed 2000 J/kg in an environment with sufficient
downdraft potential and low-midlevel vertical shear to maintain a
wind-damage threat through the afternoon from northern MS/adjacent
TN across AL to GA.  Please see MD 1175 for additional short-term
details.  Otherwise, the MCS is expected to weaken late this
evening/early tonight while moving into SC.  

In the wake of the morning convection, some additional storm
development will be possible along the trailing outflow/effective
front from north TX across southern AR into MS/AL.  The specific
corridor will depend on the southern extent of the outflow
progression with today's MCS, but some hail/wind threat will be
possible later this afternoon into tonight.

...Northeast NM into the northern TX Panhandle this evening...
Low-level flow will become upslope this afternoon, when surface
heating and low-level moisture could be sufficient for isolated
thunderstorm development near the Raton Mesa in far northeast NM. 
There is the potential for a sustained supercell to emerge from
initially high-based convection, and then move southeastward into
the northwest TX Panhandle this evening.  Moderate buoyancy (MLCAPE
of 1000-1500 J/kg), relatively straight hodographs with effective
bulk shear near or above 40 kt and midlevel lapse rates of 7-8 C/km
will support the primary threats of large hail and strong-severe
outflow gusts for a few hours this evening.

...Permian Basin this afternoon/evening...
The 12z MAF sounding revealed a warm elevated mixed layer and a
strong cap.  Surface heating/mixing along and south of an outflow
boundary could be sufficient to support isolated thunderstorm
development later this afternoon/evening, though confidence is low. 
If storms form, the environment will support splitting supercells
capable of producing isolated large hail and damaging outflow gusts
for a few hours this evening.  This area will be re-evaluated for a
possible upgrade at 20z.

...Mid MS/lower OH Valleys this afternoon/evening...
As the midlevel shortwave trough progresses east-southeastward from
northwest MO vicinity as of mid morning, there will be the potential
for a short arc of thunderstorms near and immediately southeast of
the midlevel vorticity center.  Boundary-layer dewpoints remain in
the 60s ahead of this feature, and there will be some increase in
vertical shear as the midlevel trough approaches.  However, fairly
widespread clouds, poor midlevel lapse rates and the influence of
the MCS farther south all suggest that the severe threat is best
characterized as marginal.

...Northern Plains this afternoon/evening...
A cold front will surge southeastward across ND this afternoon, in
association with a digging shortwave trough now over southern SK. 
Pre-frontal low-level moisture and buoyancy will likely remain
rather limited this afternoon, but a band of convection is expected
along the front this afternoon.  Gusty outflow winds and some hail
may occur with the strongest storms for a few hours this
afternoon/evening.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0230 PM CDT Sat Jun 07 2025

Valid 091200Z - 101200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS PORTIONS OF THE
SOUTHEAST...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms with potential for damaging winds and
large hail are possible on Monday into Monday evening across the
Southeast.

...Synopsis...
A vertically stacked cyclone will continue across the Great Lakes
region on Monday, with a cold front extending broadly from eastern
Ontario southwestward across the Ohio Valley and south into the
southern Plains. A secondary stationary front will be located near
central Virginia into the Carolinas. Thunderstorms are likely to be
ongoing across the Southern Plains with development expected along
the aforementioned boundaries in the north and east by the
afternoon.

...Southeastern US to the Ohio Valley and Central Appalachians...
Scattered thunderstorm development is likely along the cold front in
the northeast and Ohio Valley and along the stationary front in VA
and the Carolinas Tuesday afternoon. Daytime heating and moistening
should yield a broad region of MLCAPE around 500-1500 J/kg ahead of
the main cold front across the east. The primary risk with this
activity will be damaging wind. A few instances of large hail will
be possible, mainly along and near the cold front where stronger
deep layer shear will be available for organization. A southward
propagating MCS may be ongoing at the beginning of the D3 period
across the lower Mississippi Valley. Some reintensification along
residual outflow will be possible through the late
morning/afternoon.

...Southern High Plains to TX...
Diurnal storm development in New Mexico will probably remain tied to
the higher terrain with an isolated severe hail/wind threat amid
marginal deep-layer shear. Elevated convection may form downstream
of this and/or separately with weak low-level warm theta-e advection
north of the front. Sufficient effective bulk shear and elevated
buoyancy will exist for a risk of isolated large hail into Monday
night.

Valid 081200Z - 091200Z

...THERE IS A MODERATE RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHERN PLAINS...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS SOUTH/LOWER-MID
ATLANTIC PIEDMONT/COASTAL PLAIN...

CORRECTED FOR LINE ERROR

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are most likely across Oklahoma and northern
Texas to the Ark-La-Tex during the late afternoon and evening on
Sunday. A few tornadoes, destructive wind gusts of 80-100 mph, and
very large hail are possible.

...Synopsis...
A vertically stacked cyclone will drift southeast in the southern
MB/northwest ON to northern MN vicinity through early morning
Monday. The attendant surface cold front should arc from northeast
IL to the Raton Mesa by 21Z Sunday. Low-amplitude mid/upper
troughing, with multiple embedded MCVs, will move east from the
eastern Midwest and TN Valley into the Mid and South Atlantic States
by Sunday evening.

...Southern Plains...
Thunderstorm development is expected along the front in Kansas and
Oklahoma by late morning/early afternoon. South of the front,
daytime heating should  yield a gradient of strong to extreme CAPE
(3000-5000 MLCAPE) across southwestern OK into northern TX. Initial
development is likely to be supercelluar, with potential for large
to very large hail (some 3+ in) and damaging wind given steep lapse
rates through the profile and ample deep layer shear. A couple of
tornadoes remain possible where storm interactions and splitting
cells occur. Through time, mode is likely to become more
multicelluar before eventual upscale growth along congealing outflow
to an MCS. As this moves along the gradient southeast across
southwestern OK into northern TX, potential for significant winds
(80-100 mph) will be possible. 

...Ozarks to Mid-MS Valley...
Isolated to scattered thunderstorms should form along the northeast
to southwest front by late afternoon and persist through
mid-evening, before likely weakening east of the MS River owing to a
relatively confined MLCAPE plume. A strong mid-level jetlet is
expected to be centered across IA to southern WI. More moderate
deep-layer shear to the south-southeast will still be adequate for a
few supercells initially that congeal into multicell clusters.
Scattered large to isolated significant severe hail is possible,
along with scattered damaging winds and a brief tornado.

...South to Lower Mid-Atlantic States...
Boundary-layer heating is anticipated along the Atlantic
Coastal Plain and adjacent Piedmont should support MLCAPE of
1500-2500 J/kg. Multiple embedded MCVs will support at least
scattered afternoon storms developing near the higher terrain and
spreading east towards the coast. Enhanced mid-level westerlies will
support transient/weak updraft rotation and multicell clustering.
Scattered damaging winds and isolated severe hail are likely. A
couple of tornadoes are also possible in the Lower Mid-Atlantic
along the primary differential heating corridor, where low-level
shear may be adequate ahead of a central Appalachians MCV.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1151 AM CDT Sat Jun 07 2025

Valid 071700Z - 081200Z

The current forecast for elevated fire weather conditions across
portions of northeastern Montana and far northwest North Dakota is
on track, with no changes needed. As of 1630 UTC, surface
observations indicate gusty post-frontal surface winds ongoing
across much of the area, with sustained winds of 15-20 mph. Elevated
fire weather conditions are possible for a few hours this afternoon
as minimum RH values fall to 20-25% amidst at least marginally
receptive fuels and continued breeziness. Please see the previous
discussion below for more information on today's fire weather
forecast.

..Elliott.. 06/07/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0154 AM CDT Sat Jun 07 2025/

...Synopsis...
Broad upper troughing will overspread the north-central to eastern
CONUS today, supporting the northward return of low-level moisture,
as well as scattered to widespread showers and thunderstorms to much
of the U.S. east of the Rockies. As such, wildfire spread concerns
should be limited for much of the central and eastern CONUS. While
overall dry conditions will prevail across portions of the Southwest
into the Great Basin, overall fuel receptiveness and strength of the
surface wind fields appear too marginal for fire weather highlights.
One area for some wildfire-spread potential is northeast Montana.
Here, a surface cold front will sweep across the region, with
widespread 25+ mph sustained northwesterly surface winds likely
during the afternoon. Since RH may dip to 20 percent with the
aforementioned strong surface wind field, and given ERCs approaching
the 80th percentile in spots, Elevated highlights have been
introduced for far northeastern Montana.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0733 AM CDT Sat Jun 07 2025

Areas affected...northeast Arkansas...western Tennessee...and far
northern Mississippi.

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 071233Z - 071400Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...A watch may eventually be needed across western Tennessee
and vicinity.

DISCUSSION...A well-developed squall line exists this morning from
north-central Arkansas into southeast Oklahoma. Sporadic, mostly
sub-severe, wind gusts have been evident along this line this
morning. Ahead of this line, a cluster of storms has developed
within a warm-air advection regime across Arkansas. A few stronger
cells have developed within this cluster, but do not expect this
activity to produce a greater/widespread severe weather threat. The
greatest risk is associated with the squall line farther west, and
whether it maintains intensity as it moves east. At least some
heating appears likely this morning along the southern edge of the
upper-level cirrus shield.  Therefore, a severe thunderstorm watch
may be needed at some point to address this threat, but a watch is
not anticipated for the preceding cells/cluster at this time.

605 AM CDT Sat Jun 7 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Central and Northern Arkansas

* Effective this Saturday morning from 605 AM until NOON CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A couple tornadoes possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph likely
  Isolated large hail events to 1 inch in diameter possible

SUMMARY...A line of intense thunderstorms over northwest Arkansas
and eastern Oklahoma will track eastward through the morning across
the watch area.  Damaging winds along the leading edge of the storms
is the primary concern, although occasional tornadoes are also a
possibility.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 65 statute miles
north and south of a line from 50 miles west northwest of
Russellville AR to 40 miles east southeast of Batesville AR. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU3).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 381...WW 382...

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 1 inch. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 60 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean
storm motion vector 28035.

Mesoscale Discussion 1153
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0354 PM CDT Fri Jun 06 2025

Areas affected...eastern New Mexico and portions of Southwestern
Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 062054Z - 062300Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Supercells capable of large to very large hail, damaging
winds, and a couple of tornadoes likely this afternoon and evening.

DISCUSSION...Recent satellite imagery shows deepening cu across the
dryline and high terrain of eastern New Mexico. Dew points in this
region are in the upper 50s to 60s with MLCIN slowly eroding across
far southeastern New Mexico where temperatures are in the 90s.
Trends would suggest convective initiation may be delayed from
timing in most CAM guidance but should occur over the next couple of
hours. 

Strong deep layer shear around 50-55 kts will promote supercells
initially capable of large to very large hail and damaging wind.
Through time this evening, storms will be moving into a very
unstable and strongly sheared air mass across southwestern Texas. As
the low-level jet strengthens, an increase in hodograph curvature
and increasing 0-1 km SRH will likely lead to an increase in tornado
potential. A watch will likely be needed this afternoon/evening to
cover this threat.

Mesoscale Discussion 1152
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0347 PM CDT Fri Jun 06 2025

Areas affected...Eastern Kentucky

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 377...

Valid 062047Z - 062145Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 377
continues.

SUMMARY...The wind-damage threat appears to be diminishing, and the
watch may be canceled prior to 23z.

DISCUSSION...The earlier convective band has shown consistent signs
of weakening, with reduced echo tops, reflectivity and lightning
flash rates.  Though moderate buoyancy persists downstream from the
storms into eastern KY, the lack of additional surface heating
(clouds and later afternoon sun angle) and relatively weak vertical
shear suggest that any substantial/sustained uptick in storm
intensity is unlikely.  Thus, if recent trends persist, the watch
could be canceled prior to the 23z expiration.

Mesoscale Discussion 1151
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0329 PM CDT Fri Jun 06 2025

Areas affected...Western Kentucky and northern parts of
western/middle Tennessee

Concerning...Tornado Watch 376...

Valid 062029Z - 062130Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 376 continues.

SUMMARY...The threat for occasional wind damage and a couple of
tornadoes continues.

DISCUSSION...An increasingly complex surface pattern is evolving
within tornado watch 376, as a result of multiple bands/clusters of
storms and associated rain-cooled outflow.  The convective clusters
are occurring east of a remnant MCV approaching the lower OH Valley,
on the northern edge of an unstable warm sector.  Regional VWPs show
40-50 kt midlevel flow with the MCV (and associated deep-layer
vertical shear), but thus far low-level hodograph curvature/SRH has
remained somewhat limited where the majority of the convection is
occurring.  There is still some potential for embedded circulations
with an attendant tornado threat where favorable storm/boundary
interactions occur.

Mesoscale Discussion 1150
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0310 PM CDT Fri Jun 06 2025

Areas affected...Eastern Tennessee...northeast Alabama and far
northwest Georgia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 062010Z - 062145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered thunderstorms with isolated wind damage and/or
marginally severe hail will persist for the next few hours, but the
need for a watch is uncertain.

DISCUSSION...Scattered thunderstorms have formed in the unstable
warm sector from northern AL into middle and eastern TN.  This area
of convection is removed to the east-southeast of the remnant MCV
over southeast MO, and local VWPs show correspondingly weak
flow/vertical shear.  Some loose clustering of storms may occur with
outflow mergers through late afternoon/evening, but it is not clear
that any organized clusters will emerge from the storm mergers. 
Thus, it is not clear that a severe thunderstorm watch is necessary.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 376
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
110 PM CDT Fri Jun 6 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Southern Illinois
  Western into Central Kentucky
  Southeast Missouri
  Northwest into Middle Tennessee

* Effective this Friday afternoon and evening from 110 PM until
  800 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A couple tornadoes possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1 inch in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Scattered thunderstorms are forecast to develop and
intensify this afternoon as the low-level wind profile strengthens
across the Watch area.  A couple of supercell tornadoes are
possible, in addition to damaging gusts with the stronger storms.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 60 statute miles

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 378
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
145 PM MDT Fri Jun 6 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  East-Central and Southeast Colorado

* Effective this Friday afternoon and evening from 145 PM until
  900 PM MDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A couple tornadoes possible
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 3.5
    inches in diameter likely
  Scattered damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 75
    mph possible

SUMMARY...Widely scattered are forecast to develop this afternoon
near Interstate 25 and intensify as this activity moves east into
the plains.  A few supercells are likely with the more intense
supercells potentially capable of very large hail up to 3.5 inches
in diameter.  The risk for a couple of tornadoes appears greatest
during the late afternoon into the early evening when low-level
shear will strengthen.  The threat for severe gusts will probably
become more prevalent this evening as storms increase in coverage.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 70 statute miles
east and west of a line from 35 miles north of Limon CO to 40 miles
west southwest of Springfield CO. For a complete depiction of the
watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU8).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 376...WW 377...

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail

Mesoscale Discussion 1143
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0746 AM CDT Fri Jun 06 2025

Areas affected...Eastern Oklahoma far southern Mississippi...and
northwest Arkansas

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 375...

Valid 061246Z - 061415Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 375
continues.

SUMMARY...A damaging wind/tornado threat should persist for a few
more hours.

DISCUSSION...A line of storms continues to produce sporadic
damaging/severe wind gusts with occasional mesovorticies and line
embedded tornadoes. Only around 1000 to 1500 J/kg MUCAPE exists
ahead of the line now. In addition, a 40 knot low-level jet which
helped to maintain the MCS through the overnight period remains
across eastern Oklahoma and far western Arkansas with a weaker
low-level jet across central Arkansas and southern Missouri.
Therefore, as storms continue to move east of the stronger low-level
jet and the low-level jet weakens through the morning, expect this
line of storms to weaken within the weak to moderately unstable
environment.

In the meantime, a 35 knot low-level jet from the KSRX VWP and >200
m2/s2 will continue to support a severe wind/embedded tornado threat
in the near term before this weakening becomes more prevalent by
mid-morning.

Areas affected...Parts of the Texas Trans-Pecos

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 368...

Valid 052051Z - 052215Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 368
continues.

SUMMARY...Risk of very large hail continues across parts of the
Texas Trans-Pecos.

DISCUSSION...Splitting supercells are ongoing across the TX
Trans-Pecos -- in an environment with long/fairly straight
hodographs (around 40-50 kt of effective shear) and 2000-3000 J/kg
MLCAPE. Given the continued splitting/semi-discrete mode, very large
hail (3+ inches) remains the primary concern. In particular, a
large/persistent supercell cluster undergoing additional storm
merging west of Fort Stockton should pose a risk of very large hail
and severe wind gusts -- especially given recent signs of southward
propagation.

Areas affected...far eastern NM...TX South Plains

Concerning...Tornado Watch 367...

Valid 052046Z - 052245Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 367 continues.

SUMMARY...Supercell hail and tornado potential increasing through 23
UTC.  A strong tornado or two is probable once a dominant
right-moving supercell becomes established.

DISCUSSION...Visible-satellite/radar mosaic shows the
outflow/differential heating zone and maturing updrafts becoming
sustained along the boundary.  Enhanced storm-relative environmental
helicity (SRH) and elongated hodographs and a very unstable airmass
will strongly favor discrete supercell development.  Giant hail is
forecast over the next 1-3 hours with the stronger supercells (3 to
4 inches in diameter).  The tornado risk will markedly increase over
the next 0.5 to 2 hours as storms begin to propagate within the
moist boundary layer with backed low-level flow and enlarged
hodographs.

Mesoscale Discussion 1128

0333 PM CDT Thu Jun 05 2025

Areas affected...Parts of southwest Kansas

Concerning...Tornado Watch 369...

Valid 052033Z - 052200Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 369 continues.

SUMMARY...Risk of very large hail continues with an eastward-moving
supercell in far southwest KS. Tornado risk may be increasing as
well.

DISCUSSION...Ahead of a weak lee cyclone and surface boundary over
far southeastern CO, a supercell has evolved over far southwest KS.
A long/mostly straight hodograph (around 50 kt of 0-6 km shear) per
DDC VWP and moderate surface-based instability should continue to
favor large to very large hail and locally severe gusts with this
activity. Ahead of this storm, visible satellite imagery still shows
billow cloud structures -- indicating antecedent boundary-layer
static stability. However, the associated sheltered boundary layer
should be accompanied by enhanced low-level SRH, and given the
established mesocyclone, the tornado risk may be increasing.

Mesoscale Discussion 1127
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0320 PM CDT Thu Jun 05 2025

Areas affected...southeast OH...northern WV...southwest PA

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 052020Z - 052215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Strong to locally severe gusts capable of wind damage may
focus across southeast OH eastward into northern portions of WV and
southwest PA through 7-8pm EDT.

DISCUSSION...An MCV evident in radar imagery has moved
north-northeastward across western OH and another portion of this
mid-level vorticity maximum is moving east across south-central OH. 
The southern portion of this larger-scale convective-aided
disturbance is likely acting to enhance thunderstorm development
across the eastern 1/3rd of OH late this afternoon.  Surface
conditions ahead of the storm activity in southeast OH have warmed
into the lower 80s with dewpoints in the lower 60s.  Objective
analysis data shows around 1000 J/kg MLCAPE but effective shear at
or below 20 kt.  As a result, storm organization potential will
likely remain limited in terms of more organized multicellular
modes.  However, the MCV may act to focus thunderstorms and an
isolated risk for damaging gusts for the next several hours across
parts of the upper OH Valley.

Mesoscale Discussion 1126
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0306 PM CDT Thu Jun 05 2025

Areas affected...Parts of central Oklahoma

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 052006Z - 052200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...The risk of severe wind gusts and large hail could
continue spreading eastward across central Oklahoma this afternoon.
Trends are being monitored for a possible downstream watch.

DISCUSSION...A cluster of storms has become increasingly organized
as it tracks eastward along a boundary across west-central OK, as it
interacts with a warm/moist air mass amid 40 kt of effective shear.
While an earlier ACARS sounding from OKC and mesoanalysis suggest
lingering inhibition ahead of the ongoing cluster of storms,
continued diurnal heating amid upper 60s dewpoints and modestly
steep lapse rates could support the maintenance of these storms with
eastward extent across central OK through the afternoon. If this
were to occur, the 40 kt of effective shear would continue to
promote an organized cluster (and possibly embedded supercell
structure) -- capable of severe winds gusts and large hail.
Convective trends are being monitored for a possible watch
downstream of Severe Thunderstorm Watch 366.

Mesoscale Discussion 1125
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0245 PM CDT Thu Jun 05 2025

Areas affected...Parts of northeastern NM into the far western OK/TX
Panhandles

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 051945Z - 052145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...The risk of severe storms capable of producing large hail
and severe wind gusts will increase over the next few hours. The
tornado threat could eventually increase with east-southeastward
extent.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorms are developing along a wind shift over
northeastern NM this afternoon. Ahead of these evolving storms,
upper 50s to lower 60s dewpoints are contributing to moderate
surface-based instability -- given steep midlevel lapse rates.
Around 50 kt of effective shear (characterized by a long/straight
hodograph) oriented parallel to the zone of low-level ascent should
support a few supercell clusters as they move east-southeast into
the increasingly unstable air. Initial storms will pose a risk of
very large hail and severe wind gusts. The severe risk becomes more
uncertain with southeastward extent into the western TX Panhandle.
However, if storms can mature into this region, enhanced low-level
helicity would favor an increasing tornado threat as well. Trends
are being monitored for a possible watch over the area.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 371
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
350 PM CDT Thu Jun 5 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Central Oklahoma

* Effective this Thursday afternoon and evening from 350 PM until
  800 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...A cluster of storms with embedded bowing/supercell
structures will likely persist while moving east-southeastward
through central Oklahoma (especially the southern half of the OKC
metro).  Damaging gusts of 60-70 mph and large hail up to 1.5 inches
in diameter will be possible.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 45
statute miles east and west of a line from 40 miles east northeast
of Oklahoma City OK to 60 miles southeast of Oklahoma City OK. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU1).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 366...WW 367...WW

Mesoscale Discussion 1124
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0206 PM CDT Thu Jun 05 2025

Areas affected...Parts of the southern Great Basin and Southwest

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 051906Z - 052130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Sporadic severe downbursts are possible with high-based
thunderstorms through the afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Widely scattered high-based thunderstorms are evolving
across the southern Great Basin into the Southwest. Diurnal heating
beneath steep midlevel lapse rates (sampled by the 12Z VEF sounding)
and sufficient midlevel moisture are yielding a weakly unstable air
mass. While weak deep-layer flow/shear should generally limit storm
longevity/organization, enhanced evaporative cooling amid the steep
low-level lapse rates will support strong to severe downbursts with
the stronger cores. Severe-gust potential will be maximized with any
small clusters that can develop.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 367
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
120 PM CDT Thu Jun 5 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  East central and southeast New Mexico
  West central Texas

* Effective this Thursday afternoon and evening from 120 PM until
  1000 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A few tornadoes likely with a couple intense tornadoes possible
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 4
    inches in diameter likely
  Scattered damaging winds likely with isolated significant gusts
    to 80 mph possible

SUMMARY...Scattered supercell development is expected by mid
afternoon, and storms will spread eastward through late evening. 
The initial supercells could produce very large hail of 3-4 inches
in diameter, with an increasing threat for tornadoes (a couple of
which could be strong) as the storms interact with a residual
outflow boundary.  There will also be some potential for upscale
growth by this evening, with the potential for severe outflow winds
up to 75 mph.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 95 statute miles
north and south of a line from 70 miles east southeast of Lubbock TX
to 70 miles north of Carlsbad NM. For a complete depiction of the
watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU7).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

Mesoscale Discussion 1113

Areas affected...Parts of the Texas Trans-Pecos

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 042055Z - 042300Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated large hail and locally severe gusts will be
possible if storms can mature over the Trans-Pecos region this
afternoon.

DISCUSSION...The latest visible satellite imagery shows deepening
boundary-layer cumulus where a stationary front is intersecting the
higher terrain in the TX Trans-Pecos region this afternoon. Isolated
convective initiation is also underway along the TX/MX border. While
weak large-scale ascent and antecedent inhibition cast uncertainty
on storm longevity (especially away from the higher terrain
features), a long/straight hodograph (around 40-50 kt of effective
shear) and moderate-strong buoyancy will conditionally support a
discrete/semi-discrete supercell or two capable of producing large
hail and locally severe gusts. Given the conditional and potentially
localized nature of the threat, a watch is not expected.

Mesoscale Discussion 1112

0143 PM CDT Wed Jun 04 2025

Areas affected...Parts of southeast Missouri into southern/central
Illinois

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 041843Z - 042115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated strong to severe storms are possible through the
afternoon. The primary concern is locally damaging wind gusts.

DISCUSSION...Widely scattered thunderstorms are evolving
northeastward across southeastern MO -- within a zone of
differential heating along/ahead of the cold front. Despite poor
midlevel lapse rates, heating within cloud breaks amid upper
60s/lower 70s dewpoints is yielding sufficient (albeit weak)
surface-based instability. While deep-layer shear is modest across
the region (20-30 kt of effective shear), small, clockwise-curved
hodographs could still support localized convective organization
into clusters and transient supercell structures. The primary
concern is locally damaging wind gusts, especially with any
localized clustering, though a brief/weak tornado cannot be entirely
ruled out with any mini supercells that can evolve. Given the
expected localized nature of the severe threat, a watch is not
expected.

Mesoscale Discussion 1094

0344 PM CDT Tue Jun 03 2025

Areas affected...North-central Missouri

Concerning...Tornado Watch 359...

Valid 032044Z - 032145Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 359 continues.

SUMMARY...The greatest short-term threat for severe wind gusts,
large hail, and a tornado or two will exist in north-central
Missouri in WW 359.

DISCUSSION...A mature QLCS recently impacted the Kansas City metro
and vicinity and is continuing eastward through WW 359. A
consolidated bow echo is present at the northern extent of the line
(currently approaching Linn County), with a more outflow-dominated
signature present with southward extent. Both areas should continue
to pose a threat for severe wind gusts over the next couple of
hours. Periods of stronger low-level rotation were observed
recently, and some re-intensification is possible given locally
stronger low-level shear. Some semi-discrete cells have also formed
in a convergent zone ahead of the QLCS, which will pose a locally
greater threat for large hail in the short term.

Mesoscale Discussion 1093
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0339 PM CDT Tue Jun 03 2025

Areas affected...portions of eastern IL and northwest IL

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 032039Z - 032245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Severe potential will increase over the next couple of
hours. A new watch downstream from Tornado Watch 359 may be needed
late this afternoon across parts of eastern IA into northwest IL.

DISCUSSION...Airmass recovery has slowly occurred across eastern IA
into northwest IL in the wake of morning convection. Temperatures
have warmed into the upper 70s to low 80s, and dewpoints from 66-72
F are contributing to increasing MLCAPE. With time, vertical shear
is expected to remain favorable for organized convection as the QLCS
across northern MO track east/northeast with time and additional
convection develops along a cold front oriented across eastern IA.
Damaging gusts will be the main hazard with this activity. However,
the VWP at KDVN shows some enlargement of the low-level hodograph,
due in part to a 30-40 kt 850 mb southwesterly low-level jet over
the region, which is also supporting 0-1 km SRH around 100-150
m2/s2. As such, a tornado or two also could occur in addition to
strong gusts. A downstream watch may be needed in the next couple
hours.

Mesoscale Discussion 1092
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0313 PM CDT Tue Jun 03 2025

Areas affected...central OK

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 360...

Valid 032013Z - 032215Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 360
continues.

SUMMARY...Tornado potential may be increasing across central OK.

DISCUSSION...Strong cells have developed just west of the I-35
corridor in central OK. These cells show rotation aloft and the VWP
from KTLX shows an increasing low-level hodograph with 0-1 SRH near
150 m2/s2. Backed surface winds are also noted in surface
observations, along with dewpoints in the upper 60s to low 70s F.
This is contributing to strong instability and further storm
organization and intensification is possible over the next couple of
hours as these storms track northeast across central OK and the
greater OKC Metro area, and a brief tornado or two could occur with
these developing supercells. Additionally, as storms across
southwest OK move into this environment, some tornado and damaging
risk will be possible.

135 PM CDT Tue Jun 3 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Far Eastern Kansas
  West-Central into Northeastern Missouri

* Effective this Tuesday afternoon and evening from 135 PM until
  800 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A couple tornadoes possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...An organizing band of storms will likely move northeast
across the Watch along and north of modified outflow.  Moist low
levels and moderately strong low-level shear across the Watch will
support a risk for a couple of tornadoes.  A threat for damaging
gusts will probably accompany the stronger storms.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 55 statute miles
east and west of a line from 20 miles east northeast of Kirksville
MO to 45 miles south southeast of Olathe KS. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU9).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 1.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 60 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean
storm motion vector 24035.

Mesoscale Discussion 1078
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0348 PM CDT Mon Jun 02 2025

Areas affected...the Texas Panhandle

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 353...

Valid 022048Z - 022215Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 353
continues.

SUMMARY...An increase in convective intensity is expected over the
next 1 to 2 hours.

DISCUSSION...A well-developed outflow boundary has developed and is
emanating from storms across the western Texas Panhandle. This
outflow has mostly outrun the storms thus far. However, it is
quickly moving toward more favorable instability across the central
and eastern Panhandle. In fact, a boundary is apparent on the AMA
0.5 degree base reflectivity east of the radar which likely
represents the edge of the low 70s dewpoints across the eastern
Panhandle. 

As these boundaries collide, expect strong updrafts which should
strengthen the cold pool and severe wind gusts within the line. The
greatest threat for isolated 80-90 mph wind gusts this
afternoon/evening likely exists from this boundary collision
northeastward. This region has the most favorable diurnal timing and
the expectation for storm intensification as this line moves towards
the greater instability.

Mesoscale Discussion 1077
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0347 PM CDT Mon Jun 02 2025

Areas affected...Northeastern Colorado northeastward through
southwestern MN

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 022047Z - 022245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm development is likely this afternoon and
evening along a cold front across much of central Nebraska and
adjacent areas. Severe wind gusts and large hail will be the main
threats.

DISCUSSION...A Cu field is developing this afternoon across central
Nebraska to the south of a slowly sagging cold front. Very large
instability is present with temperatures rising into the upper 80s
and low 90s F across the region. Continued boundary-layer mixing
should erode any remaining inhibition, supporting convection
initiating in the next couple of hours. A number of factors should
contribute to quickly amalgamating storms, including widespread
initiation, largely line-parallel (and relatively modest) bulk shear
vectors, and ML LCLs between 1500-2000 m AGL. Large hail will be
possible with the strongest cores, particularly early in individual
storms' lifecycles, with a transition to a more widespread wind
threat likely during the evening. A tornado or two cannot be ruled
out amidst possibly complex storm interactions and/or stronger
updrafts interacting with locally enhanced surface vertical
vorticity near the front. A watch is possible this afternoon to
address these threats.

Mesoscale Discussion 1076
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0321 PM CDT Mon Jun 02 2025

Areas affected...Portions of West Texas and the Trans Pecos into
southeast New Mexico

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 022021Z - 022115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated large hail and severe wind gusts are possible
this afternoon and into this evening.

DISCUSSION...Moderate instability has developed across the Trans
Pecos and into West Texas with 1500 to 2000 J/kg MLCAPE. Some
convection has formed along the higher terrain from southeast New
Mexico to the Davis Mountains in Texas. A belt of slightly stronger
mid-level flow will overspread this region through the late
afternoon and into the evening, with RAP forecast soundings
indicating 35 to 40 knots of effective shear where southerly or
southeasterly flow remains by 23Z to 00Z. Therefore, a few
supercells are possible with a threat for large hail and severe wind
gusts. 

Large-scale forcing is mostly moving away from the region, so storm
coverage will likely remain isolated.

Mesoscale Discussion 1075
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0247 PM CDT Mon Jun 02 2025

Areas affected...eastern Colorado and western Kansas into far
southwest Nebraska.

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 021947Z - 022115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms are expected this afternoon with a primary
threat of severe wind gusts.

DISCUSSION...A gradient of instability exists across the central
High Plains with dewpoints in the 40s near the Front Range and in
the upper 60s across southwest Kansas. SPC mesoanalysis shows a
weakly unstable, but uncapped environment across southeast Colorado
where cold air associated with the upper low has started to move
east of the terrain. As heating continues and temperatures continue
to cool aloft, expect an uncapped environment across much of eastern
Colorado and western Kansas. In addition, ascent will increase as
the trough advances east. 

Therefore, expect a gradual increase in convective coverage across
northeast New Mexico and eastern Colorado this afternoon.
Eventually, these storms should become more intense as they move
toward greater instability. Some large hail is possible initially,
however, severe wind gusts will be preferred. Very steep lapse rates
will support the potential for some significant severe wind gusts of
80-90 mph this evening (in western Kansas), particularly where any
bowing line segments can develop. 

A watch will likely be needed later this afternoon for the threat
from these storms, and storms which will likely move into southwest
Kansas from watch 353.

Mesoscale Discussion 1074
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0214 PM CDT Mon Jun 02 2025

Areas affected...Southeastern Wyoming and northeastern Colorado into
western Nebraska

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 021914Z - 022115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm development is likely this afternoon, posing
a threat primarily for severe wind gusts and large hail.

DISCUSSION...Congested Cu are present in visible satellite imagery
across southeastern Wyoming, especially along the higher terrain in
advance of a slowly-southward-sagging cold front. A surface low is
developing in northeastern Colorado, promoting backing southeasterly
low-level flow and some moisture advection into the area. Limited
upper-level cloudiness has supported temperatures rising into the
mid-/upper-70s across the area, likely yielding minimal convective
inhibition in the short term.

As the cold front continues to move southward and a mid-level wave
impinges on the region, scattered thunderstorm development appears
likely in the next couple hours. 12z HREF guidance depicts multiple
stronger updrafts developing off the Laramie Mountains and moving
east into a well-mixed and unstable airmass. Amidst modest bulk
shear values (~30-35 kts) and relatively straight shear profiles,
some splitting supercells and mixed-mode storms are possible. The
primary threats should be large hail and local severe wind gusts
with the stronger cores, especially as they mature in the Nebraska
Panhandle.

Additional thunderstorms are expected in western Nebraska and points
eastward as storms erupt along the cold front later this
afternoon/evening. Trends will continue to be monitored in that
region for possible MCD/watch issuance there.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 356
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
345 PM CDT Mon Jun 2 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Eastern Colorado
  Western Kansas
  Far Southwest Nebraska

* Effective this Monday afternoon and evening from 345 PM until
  1000 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Widespread damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 85
    mph likely
  Isolated very large hail events to 2 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...A few thunderstorm clusters are forecast to move into the
Watch area this afternoon and persist into the evening.  Strong
buoyancy and large surface temperature and dewpoint spreads will
favor efficient thunderstorm downdrafts capable of severe gusts. 
Large hail may accompany the stronger thunderstorm cores this
afternoon into the early evening before thunderstorm outflow becomes
more prevalent.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 90
statute miles east and west of a line from 55 miles west northwest
of Mccook NE to 45 miles west of Liberal KS. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU6).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

0337 PM CDT Sun Jun 01 2025

Areas affected...Parts of central into southeast Texas

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 352...

Valid 012037Z - 012200Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 352
continues.

SUMMARY...The risk of large hail and severe wind gusts continues
across Severe Thunderstorm Watch 352.

DISCUSSION...A couple semi-discrete supercells continue to track
southeastward along the stationary boundary from central into
southeast TX -- along the east/southeastern periphery of around 2500
J/kg MLCAPE. While these storms are generally becoming removed from
this stronger instability, they will still pose a risk of isolated
large hail and locally severe gusts in the near term. To their
northwest, fresh updrafts are evolving along the stationary boundary
near Waco TX. Given that these evolving storms will track
southeastward through the strongest instability amid 40 kt of
effective shear, gradual intensification into semi-discrete
supercells is also possible -- posing a risk of large to very large
hail and severe wind gusts.

Areas affected...Parts of western/central North Carolina and far
northern South Carolina

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 011913Z - 012145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Widely scattered thunderstorms are expected to continue
developing/advancing eastward across western/central NC and far
northern SC through the afternoon. The strongest storms will be
capable of producing locally damaging wind gusts and marginally
severe hail. The severe threat is expected to remain too isolated
for a watch.

DISCUSSION...Along the southern periphery of a large-scale trough
over the Northeast, VWP data and earlier 12Z soundings sampled a
belt of 40-50 kt midlevel westerly flow across NC. Here,
differential heating along a weak E/W-oriented surface boundary is
supporting isolated to widely scattered showers, which should
continue to deepening into thunderstorms -- given sufficient (albeit
weak) surface-based instability. The moderate/strong westerly flow
aloft is yielding elongated/mostly straight hodographs (around 40 kt
of effective shear), which could promote localized convective
organization into small clusters capable of locally damaging wind
gusts and perhaps marginally severe hail. Current thinking is that
the overall severe threat will remain too isolated for a watch,
though convective trends will be monitored.

Mesoscale Discussion 1062
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0153 PM CDT Sun Jun 01 2025

Areas affected...central Colorado and north-central New Mexico

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 011853Z - 012130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms will continue to develop through the
afternoon. Instability will support at least some potential for hail
and gusty thunderstorm outflows. However, the lack of stronger
deep-layer shear should limit the overall severe threat to being
more transient in nature. A watch is not likely.

DISCUSSION...Terrain-driven low-level convergence has resulted in
the development of convection across the higher terrain of central
Colorado and north-central New Mexico. To the east of the higher
terrain, surface dewpoints in the 50s coupled with diurnal heating
has resulted in a corridor of MUCAPE between 1000-2000 J/kg, with
the higher values tied to higher surface moisture. Despite
sufficient instability for storm maintenance, deep-layer shear is
weak, with effective-layer shear generally less than 20 knots should
limit the ability for updraft organization. The result should be
updrafts initially tied to the terrain, where low-level convergence
will force ascent. Isolated hail and perhaps a strong wind gust or
two may be possible with these terrain-driven storms.

With time, aggregate cold pools may move off the terrain and into
the high-elevation plains adjacent to the mountains allowing for
additional thunderstorm development. Here, continued heating will
allow most-unstable CAPE to continue to increase until convective
cloud debris overspreads the area reducing insolation. However,
MUCAPE around 2000-2500 J/kg will remain possible. Forecast
soundings indicated that some increase in effective-layer shear, but
still generally below 30 knots. This may allow for some
conglomeration of updrafts and at least transient multi-cell
clusters capable of producing large hail and a strong wind gust or
two.

Given the anticipated isolated/transient nature of any organized

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 352
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
140 PM CDT Sun Jun 1 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  North-Central and East Texas

* Effective this Sunday afternoon and evening from 140 PM until
  1000 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail likely with isolated very large hail events
    to 2.5 inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Severe storms including supercell development are expected
this afternoon as a moist environment heats and destabilizes. Large
hail is expected with the most intense storms, with wind damage also
possible as these storms generally spread southeastward through
early/mid-evening.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 70
statute miles east and west of a line from 30 miles north of
Stephenville TX to 75 miles south southeast of Huntsville TX. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU2).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 600. Mean storm motion vector
33025.

Mesoscale Discussion 1060
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0705 AM CDT Sun Jun 01 2025

Areas affected...South-central Florida Peninsula

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 011205Z - 011400Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...An isolated tornado threat may continue for the next two
to three hours across south-central Florida. The threat is expected
to remain localized, and weather watch issuance appears unlikely,
although trends will be monitored.

DISCUSSION...An east-to-west band of strong thunderstorms is ongoing
across south-central Florida, along a zone of somewhat focused
low-level convergence. The storms are being supported by a shortwave
trough that is moving through the eastern Gulf. A mid-level jet
streak is analyzed by the RAP from the eastern Gulf extending
eastward across the Florida Peninsula. This jet has strengthened
deep-layer shear over south-central Florida into the 40 to 50 knot
range, according to the RAP. This will support isolated supercell
development this morning. Although RAP forecast soundings across
south-central Florida suggest that low-level shear is not
particularly strong, storm-relative helicity could be locally higher
near the zone of low-level convergence. As a result, transient
supercells could be capable of producing low to mid-level rotation,
with a brief tornado possible. Marginally severe wind gusts could
also occur. The threat should remain localized, and watch issuance
is currently not expected.

Mesoscale Discussion 1059
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0622 AM CDT Sun Jun 01 2025

Areas affected...Southern Oklahoma...North Texas

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 351...

Valid 011122Z - 011315Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 351
continues.

SUMMARY...A few strong thunderstorms, with isolated severe gusts or
hail, will be possible over the next few hours. However, any threat
should remain localized, and weather watch issuance is not expected
to the south of the current watch.

DISCUSSION...A cluster of thunderstorms is ongoing in south-central
Oklahoma, which is near a 500 mb jet analyzed by the RAP. This
cluster will continue to move southward across the remainder of
Oklahoma into parts of north Texas over the next few hours. Any
severe threat associated with the cluster will likely remain
localized and brief, primarily due to weak instability. For this
reason, weather watch issuance is not expected to the south of the
ongoing watch. 

As the outflow boundary, associated with the cluster, stalls over
north Texas later this morning, it will likely become a focus for
new convective development. Through that time, the situation will
continue to be monitored for changes in severe weather potential.
