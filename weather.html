DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM HST (1800 UTC), the broad mean center of elongating 
Tropical Storm Hone and an extratropical low was located near 
latitude 25.3 North, longitude 178.3 West. Hone is moving toward 
the west-northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h). This general motion with 
a decrease in forward speed is expected today as Hone merges with 
the extratropical low. A turn toward the north and an increase in 
forward speed is expected to resume on Monday. On the forecast 
track, Hone, or the extratropical low associated with Hone, will be 
passing near or just west of Kure Atoll near the International Date 
Line late Monday or Monday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher
gusts. Little change in strength is forecast during the next 48
hours.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND

Mesoscale Discussion 2041
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1254 PM CDT Sun Sep 01 2024

Areas affected...parts of western and northern New York

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 011754Z - 011930Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...A broken line of storms may produce occasional gusty wind
this afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Inhibition has been mostly eroded across western and
northern New York as temperatures have warmed to the upper 70s to
low 80s with mid 60s dewpoints. Expect scattered thunderstorms to
develop along a cold front once it moves east of Lake Erie and Lake
Ontario. Storms may be not be that deep given the relatively shallow
thermodynamic profile shown by the RAP forecast soundings. However,
relatively strong flow through the column and a well-mixed boundary
layer may support efficient transport of gusty winds to the surface
within these storms. Isolated damaging wind gusts are possible
through the afternoon with this threat waning near sunset.

Antilles has changed little in <br>organization since yesterday. The
disturbance is expected to move <br>westward and reach the Lesser
Antilles on Monday, then cross the <br>eastern Caribbean Sea on Tuesday.
Environmental conditions are <br>forecast to become more conducive for
development while the system <br>moves across the central and western
Caribbean Sea during the middle <br>and latter parts of the week, and a
tropical depression could form <br>during that time. Regardless of
development, this system could <br>result in some gusty winds and

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1211 PM CDT Sun Sep 01 2024

Valid 021200Z - 031200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Minimal severe risk will exist across the USA on Monday, with
thunderstorms most prevalent across parts of the Southeast and from
the Great Basin into parts of the Northwest.

...Great Basin into eastern OR into ID...
A compact upper low is forecast to move across northern CA and into
central OR on Monday, while mid and high level winds increase ahead
of it. Cooling aloft along with surface heating will result in very
steep lapse rates over much of the area, with -10 C at 500 mb as far
south as central NV. A surface trough will develop over eastern
WA/OR into western ID and northern NV, providing a focus for
scattered late-day storms.

Forecast soundings indicate inverted-v profiles, with minimal
overall CAPE values of a few hundred J/kg. This will support gusty
outflow winds with the strongest storms, however, it is unclear
whether enough downdraft material will be present to produce severe
gusts. In addition, mean winds in the lowest few km will remain
relatively weak while the stronger winds remain at or above 500 mb.
That said, an isolated gust over 50 kt cannot be ruled out, and low
severe wind probabilities may be considered in later outlooks as
confidence increases.

...Southeast...
A large upper trough will progress across the northeastern States on
Monday, with weak but cyclonic flow aloft extending into the
Southeast. Minimal cooling aloft will occur, while the air mass
remains moist. High pressure north of the region will result in
northerly winds which will tend to shunt the 70s F dewpoints toward
the coastal Carolinas, while providing minimal convergence. Daytime
heating should then result in scattered thunderstorms from parts of
GA across SC and toward coastal NC, but weak shear and poor lapse
rates suggest little severe risk.

..Thornton.. 09/01/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0151 AM CDT Sun Sep 01 2024/

...Synopsis...
Dry thunderstorms will be the primary fire weather concern for
today. Isolated dry thunderstorms were observed yesterday (Saturday)
across portions of central NV on the fringe of a modest monsoonal
moisture plume. This air mass is currently advecting northward into
north-central NV and adjacent portions of OR/ID per latest
water-vapor imagery. 00z soundings along the West Coast have already
begun to sample this mid-level moisture as well as cool mid-level
temperatures, which should support MUCAPE values between 100-250
J/kg this afternoon. Concurrently, an upper wave off the northern CA
coast is forecast to move onshore over the next 24-48 hours. Lift
ahead of this wave will overspread the moisture plume, resulting in
isolated to widely scattered thunderstorms from central OR into
eastern NV/far western UT. Dry boundary layer conditions (as well as
fast storm motions across OR) will limit rainfall accumulation and
favor dry lightning strikes. Given regional ERCs at or above the
80th percentile, dry lightning will pose a fire weather concern. 

Elsewhere across the West, dry conditions will prevail with another
day of afternoon RH minimums in the teens expected. Strengthening
southerly mid-level winds may support areas of dry/windy conditions
in the immediate lee of the central and northern Sierra Nevada, but
such conditions should remain too limited to warrant highlights.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM PARTS OF
THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS INTO THE MID-ATLANTIC AND SOUTHERN NEW
ENGLAND...

...SUMMARY...
Strong to severe thunderstorms capable of producing isolated
damaging winds may occur this afternoon across parts of the southern
Appalachians into the Mid-Atlantic and southern New England.

...Southern Appalachians into the Mid-Atlantic and Southern New
England...
Thunderstorms should gradually increase in coverage this afternoon
along/south of a diffuse front that extends from the Mid-South/lower
OH Valley into the Mid-Atlantic. Late morning visible satellite
imagery shows substantial cloud cover in the vicinity of the
boundary. Nevertheless, daytime heating of a moist low-level air
mass should allow at least weak/pockets of moderate instability to
develop by early to mid afternoon along and south/east of the front.

Modest ascent with an upper trough over eastern Canada and adjacent
Great Lakes/Northeast U.S., in combination with orographic ascent,
will likely contribute to thunderstorm development through the
afternoon and early evening.  Mid-level flow and related deep-layer
shear will remain fairly modest, especially with southward extent
across the Mid-Atlantic into the Carolinas and southern
Appalachians. Mid-level flow should still prove sufficient to
support modest thunderstorm organization.  Multiple loosely
organized multicell clusters may eventually develop and consolidate
by late afternoon and early evening, posing some threat for isolated
strong to damaging winds while moving generally eastward.  The
greatest concentration of thunderstorms should exist across parts of
southern VA into NC and upstate SC where greater instability (MLCAPE
on the order of 2000-2500 J/kg) is forecast this afternoon.

...Western/Northern New York into Northern New England...
The upper-level trough and associated surface cold front will move
east today across Ontario/Quebec provinces and Northeast U.S., with
weak surface-based instability possibly developing in advance of the
front.  This may result in a narrow, low-topped line of convection
(possibly with little lightning) moving east and accompanied by some
risk for strong/locally damaging gusts.

Tropical Storm Hone Discussion Number  41
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012024
500 AM HST Sun Sep 01 2024
 
The satellite presentation of Hone has become very ragged overnight, 
with the low-level circulation center becoming very difficult to 
locate with much confidence. An 1130z Oceansat-3 pass indicated 
that the low level center of Hone has shifted west-westward since 
the previous and appears to be merging with the mid-level low just 
east of the International Date Line. The latest subjective Dvorak 
current intensity estimates from PHFO, SAB, and JTWC, all came in 
at 2.5 (35 kt), while the objective intensity estimates were 
similar. As a result, the initial intensity has been held at a 
perhaps generous 35 kt for this advisory.
 
The initial motion is quite uncertain due to the low-level of Hone 
being in the process of merging with the mid-level low to the 
west, and is set at 300/12 kt. This general motion is expected 
to  continue today and tonight along with a decrease in forward 
speed as Hone merges with a mid-level low to the west.  Hone should 
begin moving northward with an increase in forward speed Monday and 
Monday night as it moves into a weakness in building mid-level 
ridges to the northwest and east of the system. A shift back toward 
the northwest is then expected late Tuesday through Thursday as a 
low and mid-level ridge builds to the north of Hone. The latest 
track forecast was adjusted to better align with the latest model 
guidance and generally follows the TVCE consensus.
 
Hone will be in a relatively favorable environment during the next
couple days, with warm sea surface temperatures and low vertical
wind shear. The interaction with a mid-level low, ragged LLCC and
entrainment of dry mid-level air should act to minimize the
potential for intensification however. Beyond 48 hours mid-level
moisture drops off considerably and the latest simulated satellite
imagery from the GFS and ECMWF suggest a loss of deep convection by
72 hours. As a result, the intensity forecast holds Hone as a 35 
kt Tropical Storm during the next couple days, with the cyclone 
expected to become a post-tropical remnant low by 72 hours, and 
dissipation occurring by 120 hours. The intensity forecast closely 
follows the latest intensity consensus guidance.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0748 AM CDT Sun Sep 01 2024

Valid 011300Z - 021200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM PARTS OF
THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS INTO THE MID-ATLANTIC AND SOUTHERN NEW
ENGLAND...

...SUMMARY...
Strong thunderstorms capable of producing isolated damaging winds
may occur this afternoon across parts of the southern Appalachians
into the Mid-Atlantic and southern New England.

...Southern Appalachians into the Mid-Atlantic and Southern New
England...
Thunderstorms should gradually increase in coverage this afternoon
along/south of a weak front that extends from the Mid-South/lower OH
Valley into the Mid-Atlantic. Morning visible satellite imagery
shows plentiful cloud cover near this boundary, and downstream
across parts of NC and the Mid-Atlantic into southern New England.
Still, filtered daytime heating of a moist low-level airmass should
allow at least weak instability to develop by early to mid afternoon
along and south/east of the front, even though mid-level lapse rates
will remain poor.

The glancing influence/ascent of an upper trough over eastern
Canada, along with weak orographic lift, will likely encourage
convection development through the afternoon and early evening.
Mid-level flow and related deep-layer shear are forecast to remain
fairly modest, especially with southward extent across the
Mid-Atlantic into the Carolinas and southern Appalachians. Still,
enough flow and related shear may be present to support modest
thunderstorm organization. Multiple loosely organized multicell
clusters may eventually develop and consolidate by late afternoon
and early evening, while posing some threat for isolated strong to
damaging winds as they move generally eastward. The greatest
concentration of thunderstorms should exist across parts of southern
VA into NC and upstate SC where greater instability is forecast this
afternoon. But, confidence in a more organized wind threat remains
too low to include greater severe wind probabilities.

...Western/Northern New York into Northern New England...
As the primary upper trough and related surface cold front continue
eastward across Ontario/Quebec today, daytime heating of a modestly
moist low-level airmass will occur over parts of western/northern
NY. Although poor mid-level lapse rates will likely hinder the
development of any more than weak instability across this area
(MLCAPE generally 500 J/kg of less), low/mid-level winds and related
shear in the cloud-bearing layer is expected to strengthen through
this afternoon with the approach of the upper trough. Some
high-resolution/convection-allowing model guidance shows a
low-topped line of thunderstorms developing this afternoon along or
just ahead of the cold front. As low-level lapse rates steepen with
daytime heating, some of this convection could produce isolated
strong to severe wind gusts given the strengthening low/mid-level
flow expected. The area impacted should remain fairly small across
western/northern NY (generally downstream of Lake Ontario) due to
more even more limited instability farther east across central NY
into northern New England.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0159 PM CDT Sat Aug 31 2024

Valid 021200Z - 031200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorm potential remains quite limited across the U.S.
on Monday.

...Synopsis...
Upper ridging will build over much of the central CONUS as a
mid-level trough ejects into the Atlantic, and a second mid-level
trough traverses the Pacific Northwest on Day 3/Monday. WAA, driven
by surface lee troughing across the Plains, as well as the heating
of a moist boundary layer across the southeast quadrant of the U.S.,
will foster isolated to scattered thunderstorm development from
eastern NM to the central/southern Atlantic Seaboard. At least
isolated thunderstorm development is also likely across much of the
Interior West as the West Coast mid-level trough approaches.

...Pacific Northwest...
Isolated to scattered thunderstorms may form near a weak surface low
to the lee of the Cascades late Monday afternoon into early evening.
These storms should be high based as they develop atop a boundary
layer that may mix up to 600-500 mb. Steep low and mid-level lapse
rates exceeding 9 C/km amid stronger unidirectional southwesterly
flow above 500 mb (hence elongated hodographs) may encourage storm
organization to some degree, with gusty winds possible. A Category
1/Marginal Risk for severe gusts may be needed over the Harney Basin
in eastern OR in future outlooks if greater storm coverage by
afternoon peak heating becomes apparent.

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Western Maryland
  Southwest Pennsylvania
  Northwest Virginia
  West Virginia

* Effective this Saturday afternoon and evening from 125 PM until
  700 PM EDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms are expected to increase in coverage and
move east across the watch area through the afternoon, posing a risk
for scattered damaging wind gusts and isolated instances of large
hail.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 60
statute miles east and west of a line from 40 miles northwest of
Altoona PA to 10 miles southwest of Beckley WV. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU6).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
1.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 550. Mean storm motion vector
26025.

Tropical Storm Hone Discussion Number  37
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012024
500 AM HST Sat Aug 31 2024
 
The nocturnal convective bloom persists along the eastern 
semicircle of Hone this morning. Deep convection obscured the low 
level circulation center (LLCC) through most of the night, with the 
LLCC now emerging from the western edge of the cold cloud cover. 
Subjective Dvorak satellite current intensity values ranged from 
2.0/30 kt to 2.5/35 kt between the three fix centers. UW-CIMSS ADT 
was 32 kt and, although a few points were rain-flagged, ASCAT-C 
showed enough winds in the 30 to 32 kt range within the northeast 
quadrant to justify bumping Hone's initial intensity to 35 kt for 
this forecast cycle, making this system a tropical storm again.

It seems that Hone's forward motion slowed significantly just as 
the convective bloom obscured the LLCC last evening, causing 
uncertainty as to what initial motion to assign. With the partial 
re-emergence of the LLCC from the western edge of cold cloud cover 
over the past hour, confidence in an initial motion of 315 degrees 
at 3 kt is higher than it would have been previously. Forecast 
philosophy remains unchanged. Global models show Hone's LLCC and an 
upper low less than 300 nm to its north becoming well-aligned in the 
next 24 hours as the upper feature drifts south, drawing the LLCC 
toward it. Afterward, the merged system will move slowly west 
northwestward. Because almost all track guidance wants to pull Hone 
almost due north initially, in contrast to current motion to the 
northwest, the forecast track is just to the left of the envelope 
through 24 hours, with little change made in the track forecast 
through then. The forecast track from 36 hours through 60 hours was 
adjusted noticeably to the right to keep it within the guidance 
envelope, mostly following HWRF, and creating a more pronounced kink 
in the track at 48 hours as guidance depicts the newly-aligned 
system transitioning from a west northwest track to an almost due 
north track. Beyond 72 hours, the forecast track once again closely 
mirrors the previous one.  

The environment that Hone will encounter offers far less shear and 
continued marginally favorable sea surface temperatures over the 
next 24 to 48 hours, and Hone is forecast to slowly strengthen 
during this time. Except for HAFS, which still calls for stronger 
intensification, the intensity guidance envelope is rather tight 
and well-behaved. The intensity forecast lies comfortably within 
this envelope, close to TVCN. Hone's intensity will peak by 72 hours 
at 50 kt, then slowly decrease afterward as it travels across the 
western North Pacific. After passing south of the northwest 
Hawaiian Islands, this system is forecast to cross the 
International Dateline late Sunday night Hawaii time.

Tropical Depression Hone Discussion Number  33
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012024
500 AM HST Fri Aug 30 2024
 
Like last night, convection bloomed across the eastern flank of 
Hone's low level circulation center (LLCC) between 06Z and 12Z. 
This recent convection partially obscured the LLCC initially, but 
has been sheared eastward just enough to make this feature 
discernible in satellite imagery. Subjective Dvorak satellite 
current intensity estimates were 2.0/30 kt from PHFO and JTWC, and 
1.5/25 kt from SAB. Unfortunately, the ASCAT pass missed Hone 
entirely. The 1110Z objective Dvorak estimate from UW/CIMSS of 32 kt 
remains close to the subjective estimates, and the intensity is set 
at 30 kt for this advisory, maintaining Hone's status as a tropical 
depression.
 
Hone began a slight turn to the north last evening and continues to 
make this turn with the 12Z cycle. The initial motion of 290 
degrees at 7 kt is in line with the previous forecast track and 
little change was introduced to the current forecast track through 
24 hours. As before, forecast track philosophy revolves around 
likely interaction of the LLCC with an upper low north of Midway 
Atoll. This upper low is forecast to dig southward over the next few 
days and Hone is expected to be pulled northwestward toward it. 
After Hone's LLCC and the upper low become aligned, the tropical 
cyclone is expected to resume a west-northwest motion over the 
western Pacific. The track guidance envelope through 72 hours 
remains rather tight, but has shifted to the right between 24 and 72 
hours, possibly predicting a stronger interaction with the upper 
low.The forecast track for this cycle has been adjusted a bit to 
the right of the previous one from 24 to 72 hours, with little 
change introduced outside of this window. Combined with the current 
motion, this results in a forecast track which depicts a steeper 
climb northward in the mid term.

Hone needs to maintain a shroud of organized deep convection for 
reintensification, and the recent nocturnal bloom was certainly a 
good start. If Hone manages to survive the 45 kt of westerly shear 
it is seeing now, there may be an opportunity for 
reintensification. However, in spite of a bit of a boost from last 
cycle, intensity models remain somewhat bearish on this possibility. 
Only HAFS, representing the high side of the envelope, takes Hone 
back to hurricane/typhoon strength. HWRF depicts Hone as a minimal 
tropical storm through 72 hours before granting a bit of 
strengthening. HCCA gradually strengthens Hone to 50 kt at 72 hours, 
then tries to dissipate it shortly after 120 hours. Global models 
generally try to do the same. In other words, intensity guidance 
varies widely after 48 hours as each model or ensemble copes with 
the uncertainty associated with Hone's interaction with the upper 
low north of Midway Atoll. The current intensity forecast closely 
follows the previous one, which lies within the wide guidance 
spread. Following our track and intensity forecast, Hone should 
cross the International Dateline as a mid-range tropical storm on 
Sunday, Hawaii time.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0115 AM CDT Fri Aug 30 2024

Valid 311200Z - 011200Z

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns will remain confined to portions of the Great
Basin for Saturday. Upper-level ridging currently over the western
CONUS will begin to slowly shift east towards the central Rockies
over the next 48-72 hours. As this occurs, a modest plume of
monsoonal moisture will spread north/northwest into southeastern NV
and southwest UT. Weak mid/upper-level ascent impinging on the
fringe of the moisture plume should support isolated thunderstorms
by late afternoon. A deep, well-mixed boundary layer will promote
limited rainfall with this activity over a region with generally
receptive fuels (ERC values at/above the 80th percentile).
Consequently, dry lightning will be a fire weather concern. 

Elsewhere across the West, dry conditions will persist, and
increasing mid-level flow along the West Coast may support some
breezy conditions in the immediate lee of the central to southern
Sierra Nevada. However, confidence in widespread elevated conditions
remains too limited for highlights.

Tropical Storm Hone Discussion Number  28
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012024
1100 PM HST Wed Aug 28 2024
 
Deep convection continues to develop to the north and northeast of 
low-level circulation center of Hone this evening. The center had 
been fully exposed for most of the afternoon and early evening 
hours as the cyclone continues to get hammered by 40 to 45 kt 
of westerly vertical wind shear. The subjective Dvorak current 
intensity estimates from PHFO, JTWC, and SAB ranged from 2.0 (35 kt) 
to 3.0 (45 kt), while a 06z SATCON estimate from UW-CIMSS was 40 
kt. These estimates in combination with the ragged appearance of 
Hone support lowering the initial intensity to 40 kt for this 
advisory.

Hone continues to move west to west-northwest or 280/8 kt. This 
motion is expected to continue during the next 36 hours as the 
cyclone is steered by a low to mid-level ridge to the north. After 
36 hours, the cyclone will begin interacting with a developing mid- 
level low near the International Dateline. A turn toward the 
northwest with a decrease in forward speed is expected Friday and 
Friday night, followed by a more northerly motion and an increase in 
speed on Saturday. The cyclone is then expected to shift westerly 
Sunday through early next week as a mid-level ridge builds to the 
north of the system. The track forecast closely follows a blend of 
the multi-model consensus aids and is very close to the previous 
track forecast. This track takes Hone toward the northwest Hawaiian 
Islands over the weekend, where there is some potential for impacts 
to Kure, Midway, and Pearl and Hermes Atolls.

Hone will remain under the influence of strong westerly vertical 
wind shear of 35 to 45 knots and dry mid-level air during the next 
36 hours. This should lead to slight weakening of the cyclone with 
convection continuing to flare to the north and northeast of the 
low level center. Beyond 36 hours, vertical wind shear will 
gradually trend lower while mid-level moisture increases. This in 
combination with warm sea surface temperatures of 28 to 29 C and 
high ocean heat content should allow for some strengthening of the 
cyclone if it manages to survive the hostile environment it will be 
in through early Friday. The intensity forecast calls for little 
change in strength during the next 48 hours, followed by gradual 
strengthening through the end of the forecast period. This 
generally follows the intensity consensus guidance through the 
forecast period. Only minor adjustments were made to the previous 
intensity forecast through 48 hours, with a slight upward adjustment 
beyond due to the increasingly favorable environment expected 
around Hone.

Tropical Storm Gilma Discussion Number  45
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   EP072024
1100 PM HST Wed Aug 28 2024
 
A few thunderstorms have been able to develop in association with 
Gilma's circulation this evening, but they have been unable to 
either wrap around, or move over, the center. This pulsing 
disorganized convection is doing little to sustain Gilma as a 
tropical cyclone, while also leading to lowering subjective and 
objective Dvorak intensity estimates that range from 1.5/25 kt to 
2.5/35 kt. The initial intensity estimate for this advisory is 
maintained at 35 kt, primarily based on a 0643Z ASCAT pass that 
showed maximum winds of 32 kt. 

Gilma's forward motion remains a steady 280/12 kt. A low-level 
ridge north of the cyclone will continue to steer it just north of 
due west over the next day or so, with a turn toward the 
west-northwest expected Friday as the ridge weakens. Little change 
to the previous forecast track was made, as consensus track guidance 
remains well clustered. 

Water vapor imagery and shear analyses indicate that Gilma is 
moving into an area of increasing westerly vertical wind shear on 
the order of 20-30 kt, associated with a trough aloft approaching 
from the west. GFS and ECMWF simulated satellite imagery indicate 
that Gilma will only produce brief periods of deep convection over 
the next day or two, with Gilma gradually spinning down from its 
peak that occurred just a few days ago. Gilma will likely become a 
post-tropical remnant low on Thursday, continue gradually weakening 
as it moves close to Hawaii on Friday, then dissipate in the 
vicinity of Kauai early Saturday.

Remnants Of Hector Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082024
200 AM PDT Thu Aug 29 2024
 
An overnight scatterometer pass showed that the low-level center of 
Hector has opened up into a trough.  There remains a limited area 
of shallow convection displaced over 250 n mi from the remnants of 
the center.  The initial intensity has been reduced to 30 kt based 
on the ASCAT data.  The remnants of Hector should continue to move 
generally westward for the next couple of days.

This is the final NHC advisory for Hector.  For additional 
information on this system, please see High Seas Forecasts issued by 
the National Weather Service, under AWIPS header NFDHSFEPI, WMO 
header FZPN02 KWBC, and on the web at 
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFEPI.php.

Tropical Storm Gilma Discussion Number  42
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   EP072024
500 AM HST Wed Aug 28 2024
 
ProxyVis satellite imagery shows Gilma's exposed low-level 
circulation center tracking just north of due west. Limited 
deep convection is forming a weak curved band north and northeast 
of the center, where an earlier ASCAT pass detected winds near 40 
kt. This data, and a blend of the subjective Dvorak estimates from 
PHFO, JTWC and SAB, supports lowering the initial intensity estimate 
to 40 kt. 

The initial motion estimate is 280/12 kt. A low-level ridge north 
of Gilma will continue to steer the shallow cyclone westward to 
west-northwestward until it dissipates near Kauai this weekend. 
There has been little change in the track guidance, and the new 
forecast track is similar to the previous track, and lies close to 
HCCA and FSSE guidance.

Gilma is expected to gradually degenerate to a remnant low as it 
passes close to the Hawaiian Islands Friday into Saturday. Guidance 
indicates the strong westerly vertical wind shear currently 
impacting Gilma will briefly ease later today as a passing trough 
aloft lifts north, slowing the recent rapid weakening trend. Another 
trough aloft approaching from the west will bring even stronger 
vertical wind shear Thursday and Friday, eventually leading to 
dissipation. The new intensity forecast follows trends presented by 
the intensity consensus IVCN and SHIPS.

Tropical Storm Hone Discussion Number  25
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012024
500 AM HST Wed Aug 28 2024
 
Convection redeveloped over the low-level circulation center 
(LLCC) of Hone shortly after the previous advisory, then collapsed a 
couple hours later allowing the LLCC to become exposed once again. 
It is clear the strong westerly vertical wind shear in excess 
of 40 knots is impeding any chance for intensification of this 
system at the moment. The  latest subjective Dvorak current 
intensity estimates remain between 2.5 (35 kt) and 3.5 (55 kt). 
In addition a 0845Z ASCAT pass showed several 40 to 45 kt wind 
barbs. As a result, the initial intensity has been held at 45 kt for 
this advisory.
 
Hone continues to move just north of due west or 280/8 kt. This
general motion is expected to continue during the next couple of
days as the cyclone is steered by a low to mid-level ridge to the
north. The motion is a bit more uncertain by the weekend as the
system begins to interact with a mid-level low near the
International Date Line. The track forecast calls for a slowing in
forward speed and a turn toward the northwest as a result of this
interaction. Little change was made to the official track forecast 
which closely follows a blend of the FSSE, TVCE, and HCCA consensus 
track guidance.
 
Strong westerly vertical wind shear of around 40 kt is forecast to
affect Hone during the next few days. This combined with dry
mid-level air surrounding the system should result in gradual
weakening despite the cyclone moving over increasingly warm sea
surface temperatures and higher ocean heat content. The intensity
forecast calls for slow weakening of the system, with Hone
forecast to become a post-tropical low on Friday, and dissipate by
Sunday. Little change was made to the intensity forecast which
remains closely aligned with a blend of the statistical and 
dynamical consensus aids.

Tropical Storm Hector Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082024
500 AM HST Wed Aug 28 2024

GOES-18 proxy-vis imagery shows that the low-level center of Hector 
is exposed to the southwest of a large area of deep convection.  A 
28/1040 UTC ATMS microwave pass also supports the analysis of the 
exposed center located to the southwest of the convection.  An 
ASCAT-B pass from 28/0608 UTC showed wind vectors up to 38 kt to the 
north of the center.  However, the ASCAT data also shows that the 
wind structure on the south side is becoming weak and elongated.  
Although the scatterometer data still shows some weak west winds on 
the south side, Hector could be close to opening up into a trough.  
Subjective current intensity estimates are 45 kt from both TAFB and 
SAB.  Objective intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS are a bit lower, 
ranging from 35 to 44 kt.  The initial intensity is held at 45 kt 
for this advisory.

The center of Hector is becoming a bit more ambiguous as there 
appears to be a couple of weak swirls, and the best estimate of the 
motion is westward, or 275/9 kt.  The cyclone should continue moving 
close to due west, steered by a low- to mid-level subtropical ridge 
to its north.  The new NHC forecast is just a tad slower than the 
previous official forecast and is close to the TVCE consensus aid.

Moderate west-southwesterly wind shear has already caused the 
convective area to be displaced well to the northeast of the 
center.  Given that Hector is expected to continue traveling within 
an environment of marginal SSTs, dry air, and moderate 
southwesterly shear, the NHC forecast will continue to show 
weakening, in agreement with the latest intensity consensus 
guidance.  Simulated satellite imagery from the GFS and ECMWF 
models suggests that Hector should lose its convection on Thursday, 
and the official forecast continues to show Hector degenerating to 
a remnant low at that time.  Most of the global models show the 
remnants of Hector opening up into a trough by Friday.  However, 
given the recent deteriorating surface wind structure observed on 
ASCAT and GOES-18 proxy vis imagery, it would not be surprising if 
Hector dissipated sooner than forecast.

Tropical Storm Gilma Discussion Number  41
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   EP072024
1100 PM HST Tue Aug 27 2024
 
 
Infrared satellite imagery shows new deep convection in Gilma's 
northeast quadrant this evening, with cloud tops colder than -70 
deg C. These thunderstorms have been unable to wrap around the 
center of the cyclone due to strong westerly winds aloft. The 
advisory intensity estimate is held at 45 kt based on a consensus 
of subjective Dvorak estimates of 3.0/45 kt from PHFO, JTWC and 
SAB. 

Gilma continues to move almost due west, and the initial motion 
estimate is 275/11 kt. A low-level ridge north of Gilma will 
steer the shallow cyclone westward to west-northwestward until it 
dissipates. There has been little change in the track guidance, and 
the new forecast track is similar to the previous track, and lies 
close to HCCA and FSSE guidance.

Although Gilma's recent rapid weakening trend has eased this 
evening, it is still expected to degenerate to a remnant low as it 
passes close to the Hawaiian Islands Friday and Saturday. Only 
slight changes to the intensity forecast have been made, mainly to 
keep Gilma at minimal tropical storm strength for a bit longer than 
previously indicated. Guidance indicates the strong westerly 
vertical wind shear currently impacting Gilma's circulation may 
briefly ease Wednesday as a passing trough aloft lifts north. 
Another trough aloft approaching from the west is expected to bring 
even stronger vertical wind shear Thursday and Friday, eventually 
leading to dissipation near Hawaii this weekend. The new intensity 
forecast follows trends presented by regional hurricane guidance and 
SHIPS guidance.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM HST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Hone was
located near latitude 20.4 North, longitude 167.8 West. Hone is
moving toward the west near 10 mph (17 km/h),  and a westward to
west-northwestward motion is expected for the next few days.  On the
forecast track, Hone will continue moving away from the main 
Hawaiian Islands, and pass well north of Johnston Island late 
tonight and early Wednesday. 
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Gradual weakening is expected during the next couple of days, and
Hone is forecast to become a post-tropical low by Friday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).

Tropical Storm Hone Discussion Number  24
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012024
1100 PM HST Tue Aug 27 2024
 
The low-level circulation center of Hone became exposed earlier
this evening, due to increasingly strong westerly vertical wind
shear of around 35 knots. Even though the LLCC is displaced to the
west of the persistent deep convection, the latest subjective
Dvorak current intensity estimates remain between 2.5 (35 kt) and
3.5 (55 kt). As a result, the initial intensity has been held at 45
kt for this advisory.
 
Hone continues to move just north of due west or 280/9 kt. This 
general motion is expected to continue during the next couple of 
days as the cyclone is steered by a low to mid-level ridge to the 
north. The motion is a bit more uncertain by the weekend as the
system begins to interact with a mid-level low near the
International Date Line. The track forecast calls for a slowing in
forward speed and a turn toward the northwest as a result of this
interaction. Little change was made to the track forecast during
the next couple days, followed by a nudge to the north over the
weekend to better align with the latest dynamical and consensus 
guidance.
 
Strong westerly vertical wind shear of around 40 kt is forecast to
affect Hone during the next few days. This combined with dry
mid-level air surrounding the system should result in gradual
weakening despite the cyclone moving over increasingly warm sea
surface temperatures and higher ocean heat content. The intensity 
forecast calls for slow weakening of the system, with Hone 
forecast to become a post-tropical low by Friday, and dissipate on 
Sunday. Little change was made to the intensity forecast which 
remains closely aligned with the latest intensity consensus 
guidance.

Tropical Storm Hector Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082024
1100 PM HST Tue Aug 27 2024
 
Hector continues to produce a large area of deep convection,
although it has become a little less organized this evening. Recent
microwave imagery depicts that the system is starting to tilt due to
15-20 kt of westerly wind shear. A recent scatterometer pass of
ASCAT-B depicted satellite derived winds around 38-40 kt. Subjective
and objective intensity estimates have held steady for this advisory
and range from 40-45 kt. Using a blend of ASCAT data and the
intensity estimates, the intensity is held at 45 kt for this
advisory.
 
The tropical storm continues to move west-northwestward at 285/10 
kt. The mid-level ridge ridge to the north will keep Hector on a 
west-northwestward to westward motion the next day or so. As the 
system weakens and becomes vertically shallow a more westward motion 
will occur as the system is steered in the low-level flow. The model 
guidance is in fairly good agreement and the latest NHC track 
forecast is very close to the previous advisory.
 
Atmospheric and oceanic conditions near the system are not very 
favorable as Hector will continue to deal with westerly wind shear, 
drier air, and moves over sub 26C sea surface temperatures. This 
should cause Hector to gradually weaken over the next few days. 
Global models are in fairly good agreement that the system will 
struggle to produce organized deep convection in about 36 h, and 
open into a trough and dissipate in 60 h. This is reflected in the 
latest NHC intensity forecast, which lies near the consensus aids.

Tropical Storm Hector Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082024
500 AM HST Tue Aug 27 2024
 
Hector has become less organized during the past 12-24 hours.  The 
center is now located near the western edge of a ragged convective 
mass.  Objective and subjective T-numbers have decreased and the 
initial intensity has been reduced to 40 kt, which is a blend of 
these estimates.  The environment ahead of Gilma does not look 
conducive.  Moderate westerly shear, dry mid-level air, and 
marginal sea surface temperatures should cause gradual weakening 
over the next 36-48 hours.  Hector will be moving over the cool wake 
of Gilma and this could result in a faster rate of weakening than 
indicated below.  The system is now forecast to become a remnant 
low in about 60 hours, and dissipate by day 4. 
 
Hector is moving west-northwestward at 10 kt.  A turn to the west
is expected during the next day or so as a low- to mid-level ridge 
builds to the north of Hector.  The latest NHC track forecast is 
near or slightly north of the previous forecast due to a more 
northward initial position, but it still lies near the model 
consensus.

Tropical Storm Hone Discussion Number  21
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012024
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
500 AM HST Tue Aug 27 2024
 
Hone continues to produce some vigorous deep convection, but this 
activity is not well organized, and the overall cloud pattern is 
rather ragged-looking.  The area of cold cloud tops has a sharp edge 
on the western side of the circulation, indicative of westerly shear 
over the system.  The advisory intensity is set at 45 kt in 
agreement with a subjective Dvorak satellite estimate from PHFO. 

The storm is moving a little north of west with an initial motion 
estimate of 280/12 kt.  A mid-level subtropical ridge is forecast to 
remain north of Hone for the next 48 to 72 hours.  This should 
result in a generally west-northwestward track until the system 
dissipates later this week.  The official forecast track is very 
close to the previous one and in good agreement with the dynamical 
model consensus.

Hone is likely to remain in an environment of strong upper-level 
westerly winds for the next few days, which should maintain strong 
vertical wind shear over the cyclone.  Thus, even though the system 
will be traversing gradually warmer waters, shear and dry air are 
likely to cause weakening through the forecast period.  Simulated IR 
satellite imagery from the GFS and ECMWF global models show the 
system losing most of its deep convection in about 60 hours, as does 
the official forecast.  By the weekend, the dynamical guidance 
indicates that Hone will open up into a trough over the western part 
of the Central Pacific basin.

Hurricane Gilma Discussion Number  37
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072024
1100 PM HST Mon Aug 26 2024
 
Satellite imagery depicts Gilma has started to weaken, and become 
less organized over the last several hours. Infrared images indicate 
that the previous well-defined eye has filled, and cloud tops have 
started to warm. The system is starting to encounter some westerly 
wind shear as well, as evident by a sharper sheared edge on the 
western side of the cyclone. A SSMIS microwave pass around 03Z 
depicts the eyewall has started to become less pronounced on the 
southern side, and may even be open. Subjective and objective 
intensity estimates have decreased from the previous advisory and 
range between 85-95 kt. Given the satellite degradation and a blend 
of the intensity estimates, the initial intensity is lowered to 90 
kt for this advisory.
 
Gilma is moving westward at 275/9 kt. A subtropical ridge should 
continue to steer the system generally westward to 
west-northwestward, with a gradual increase in forward speed over 
the next several days. On this track, Gilma should enter the Central 
Pacific basin by tomorrow. The track guidance continues to be fairly 
well clustered, with the main difference being the forward speed. 
The NHC track forecast is a little faster than the previous one, and 
lies near the simple consensus aids.
 
While Gilma has fought off the marginal environment and maintained 
hurricane status longer than anticipated, it seems the atmospheric 
and oceanic conditions are becoming increasingly unfavorable. 
Westerly wind shear is starting to increase, as is evident in the 
satellite depiction, and is forecast to increase throughout the next 
several days. The system is also starting to move into a drier and 
more stable airmass with sub 26C sea-surface temperatures. This will 
result in steady weakening throughout the forecast period. Model 
simulated satellite suggest that Gilma will struggle to produce deep 
convection around 72 h and is now forecast to degenerate into a 
remnant low at that time. Global models also indicate that Gilma 
should dissipate into an open trough by the end of the forecast 
period. The NHC intensity forecast is similar to the previous and 
lies near the simple and corrected consensus intensity aids.

Mesoscale Discussion 1998
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0126 PM CDT Mon Aug 26 2024

Areas affected...Portions of southern New England

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 648...

Valid 261826Z - 262030Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 648
continues.

SUMMARY...Large hail and isolated wind damage will remain possible
until storms move offshore. Should additional storms develop to the
north, the severe risk will likely be more marginal.

DISCUSSION...Scattered storms continue across parts of southern New
England. Thus far, 1-1.5 inch hail has been the primary observed
hazard over the past 90 minutes. The environment will remain
supportive of large hail and isolated wind damage before storms move
offshore within the next few hours. Given the position of the
greatest mid-level ascent on water vapor imagery, additional
development to the north of the current activity will likely be more
isolated in nature. With shear and buoyancy weaker with northern
extent, the severe threat should remain more marginal.

Mesoscale Discussion 1997
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1235 PM CDT Mon Aug 26 2024

Areas affected...Portions of central Minnesota

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 261735Z - 261900Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Initial storm development in central Minnesota may be
elevated to marginally surface based and struggle against residual
capping. Should storms mature, large hail and wind damage are
possible. A watch is possible, but this will depend on trends in
convective evolution.

DISCUSSION...Convection has developed in west-central Minnesota,
likely aided by weak warm advection at lower levels. This mornings
soundings from Aberdeen/Minneapolis showed a warm nose within the
850-700 mb layer. It appears that convection is struggling to
intensify/organize with this capping in place. Furthermore,
large-scale ascent is currently weak. Should this activity mature,
large hail and isolated wind damage would be possible.

Short-term guidance is not consistent in how this activity will
evolve, with some suggesting it will weaken in the next few hours
and others showing cold pool development that spurs new convection
farther south where greater buoyancy resides. From a large-scale
perspective, greater ascent/mid-level cooling is not expected until
later in the afternoon, though an MCV moving through eastern South
Dakota could potentially supplement ascent locally earlier. The most
probable scenario is that more robust convection will develop by
mid/late afternoon near an area of surface convergence in central
Minnesota. The need for a watch in the short term is uncertain;
however, trends will continue to be closely monitored this
afternoon.

Mesoscale Discussion 1996
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1215 PM CDT Mon Aug 26 2024

Areas affected...northeast WY...southeast MT...western SD...and
western NE

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 261715Z - 261915Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...Severe thunderstorm potential will increase over the next
few hours across eastern Wyoming into far southeast Montana, western
South Dakota and western Nebraska. Large hail and severe wind gusts
possible with this activity. A severe thunderstorm watch will likely
be needed for portions of the region in the next couple of hours.

DISCUSSION...A strong mid/upper trough will continue to eject
east/northeast across WY/MT this afternoon, providing ample
large-scale ascent for thunderstorm development. Boundary-layer
moisture will remain modest, but cool temperatures aloft/steep lapse
rates will foster MLCAPE from 1000-2000 J/kg. Effective shear
greater than 40 kt will favor organized updrafts, with a mix of
supercells and line segments possible. Elongated/straight hodographs
combined with a favorable thermodynamic and kinematic environment
will support large hail, with some potential for isolated hail
stones in the 2-3 inch diameter range in the strongest cells.
Additional heating will result in steepening low-level lapse rates,
enhancing severe gust potential, particularly across parts of
eastern WY into far southwest SD and northwest NE, where a few gusts
greater than 70 mph are possible. 

Some uncertainty exists on the north/east extent of severe potential
as morning convection across central SD has left lingering cloud
cover while reinforcing a more southward position of a surface
baroclinic zone near the SD/NE border. Nevertheless, a severe
thunderstorm watch will likely be needed for portions of the MCD
area within the next couple of hours.

Mesoscale Discussion 1995
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1051 AM CDT Mon Aug 26 2024

Areas affected...portions of New England

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 261551Z - 261745Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated thunderstorms may produce gusty winds and hail
around 1-1.5 inch diameter through the afternoon. Trends are being
monitored for possible watch issuance.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorms are gradually increasing in coverage and
intensity at midday as strong heating occurs across a seasonally
moist airmass. The 12z RAOB from ALB indicated modestly steep
midlevel lapse rates around 6.5-7 C/km amid 30 kt 0-6 km
northwesterly flow. Cool midlevel temperatures contributing modest
instability, and elongated/straight hodographs suggest large hail
will be possible with stronger cells. Effective shear magnitudes
will be somewhat marginal for longer-lived well-organized updrafts,
and convection may be somewhat pulse-like. As additional heating
occurs, steepening low-level lapse rates also may support sporadic
strong/locally damaging gusts. Convective trends are being monitored
for possible watch issuance for portions of the MCD area, with
somewhat greater watch potential focused across southern New England
this afternoon.

SUMMARY...Isolated thunderstorms may sporadically produce large hail
to near 1.25 inch diameter and strong gusts to 65 mph into early
afternoon across portions of central Wyoming.

DISCUSSION...Isolated strong to severe thunderstorms have developed
this morning within strong ascent associated with an upper shortwave
trough now ejecting east/northeast across western WY. The 12z RAOB
from RIW showed very steep midlevel lapse rates and cold
temperatures aloft amid increasing south/southwesterly mid/upper
level flow. This vertical wind profile will maintain
elongated/straight hodographs as the system continues to progress
east/northeast into early afternoon. This environment will remain
favorable for marginally severe hail over the next few hours. As
stronger heating occurs with eastward extent, steepening low-level
lapse rates and only modest boundary layer moisture may foster
isolated strong gusts as well. Given limited coverage and overall
marginal nature of the severe risk over the next few hours, a watch
is not expected.

Hurricane Gilma Discussion Number  34
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072024
500 AM HST Mon Aug 26 2024
 
Gilma still has a well-defined eye, seen on GOES-18 infrared and 
proxy-vis satellite imagery.  The latest subjective intensity 
estimates are T-4.5/77 kt from TAFB and T-5.0/90 kt from SAB. Recent 
objective intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS such as the ADT and 
DPRINT are in the 80 to 85 kt range.  However, during the last 
couple of hours, the eye has warmed and the cloud tops in the 
eyewall have cooled, so the initial intensity is increased to 90 kt, 
in best agreement with the SAB Dvorak intensity estimate.

Gilma is likely currently experiencing 10 to 15 kt of westerly wind 
shear as it continues moving near and parallel to the 26C SST 
isotherm.  Fluctuations in intensity appear possible for the next 12 
h.  Beyond 12 to 18 h, the westerly shear is forecast to increase to 
the 15 to 20 kt range, and the SSTs are forecast to decrease 
slightly along the path beyond 36 h.  These factors, along with the 
relatively dry, stable environmental air mass that Gilma will be 
traversing for the remainder of its lifetime, are expected to lead 
to continued steady weakening.  The NHC intensity forecast is a bit 
higher than the previous official forecast at hour 12, and then is 
similar to the previous official forecast.  The NHC forecast is near 
the middle of the intensity guidance envelope.
 
Gilma's initial motion is estimated to be westward, or 275/7 kt as
it continues moving along the southern periphery of a
mid-tropospheric subtropical ridge.  The models continue to be in
good cross-track agreement that the west to west-northwestward
motion will continue, although there are still some along-track
differences in the guidance.  The new NHC forecast lies very close
to, but perhaps a touch to the south of the previous official
forecast.  This forecast is close to the HCCA and TCVE consensus
aids.

Moderate westerly shear is continuing to take a toll on Hone. The 
low level circulation appears to be partly exposed and the center 
is likely near the western edge of an earlier burst of convection. 
PHFO and JTWC subjective intensities were 3.5, which agrees well 
with UW-CIMSS SATCON and AiDT. The initial intensity was lowered to 
55 kt with this advisory.

Hone continues to move just north of due west, 280/11, to the south 
of deep layer ridging. This general motion should persist for the 
next several days and the track guidance is still relatively 
tightly clustered. The current forecast is very similar to the 
previous forecast track. Although Hone will be moving over warmer 
sea surface temperatures, increasingly strong shear through the 
forecast period will continue to gradually weaken the tropical 
cyclone. Later in the forecast period, the low level trade wind 
flow will continue to take the shallow circulation of Hone on a 
westward journey. Most of the guidance shows a slightly slower 
forward speed prior to expected dissipation. The intensity forecast 
continues to be a blend of the statistical and dynamical guidance, 
and very similar to the previous forecast package. Hone should 
become a remnant low in about 4 days prior to dissipation as it 
approaches the International Date Line.

Tropical Storm Hector Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082024
500 AM HST Mon Aug 26 2024

Microwave imagery continues to show evidence of northerly shear 
over the cyclone, with the mid-level center displaced a little to 
the south of the surface center.  However, the overall cloud 
pattern appears to be slightly better organized than it was 
yesterday with some evidence of banding features over the eastern 
portion of the circulation.  The advisory intensity has been 
increased a bit, to 45 kt, in agreement with subjective Dvorak 
Current Intensity Numbers from TAFB and SAB.
 
Center fixes from geostationary and microwave imagery give a 
westward motion at around 270/9 kt.  A weak low- to mid-level ridge 
is currently situated to the north of Hector, and the global 
models suggest that the ridge will build a little in a few days.  
The track guidance calls for a west-northwestward to westward 
heading with a slight increase in forward speed for the next 3-5 
days.  The official forecast is similar to the previous one and 
follows the dynamical model consensus predictions.

Although the vertical shear is not forecast to be very strong, 
Hector is expected to traverse marginal SSTs for the next few days 
while it moves over or near the oceanic wake of Hurricane Gilma.  
Also, the global models show the system encountering increasingly 
dry air at low- to mid-levels.  The intensity guidance does not 
call for much additional strengthening and the official 
forecast is at the high end of the model predictions.  With the
expected less favorable environment, a weakening trend is likely to 
begin in a couple of days.  Simulated satellite imagery from the 
ECMWF and GFS models show little or no deep convection associated 
with Hector by the end of the forecast period, so the official 
forecast calls for the system to become a remnant low at that time.

Tropical Storm Hone Discussion Number  16
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012024
1100 PM HST Sun Aug 25 2024
 
Hone appears quite disorganized on satellite and radar this 
evening. However, the earlier exposed low level circulation center 
is once again obscured by layered cloud, and a ragged band of deep 
convection has redeveloped around a portion of the low level 
circulation center. The current intensity has been reduced to 60 kt, 
which is a blend of the unanimous data-T numbers and current 
intensity estimates from the fix agencies. This could be generous, 
given Hone's messy appearance.

The initial motion is 280/12. Deep layer ridging to the north of 
Hone is expected to maintain the system on a westerly track the 
next few days. Later in the forecast period, Hone is expected to be 
increasingly steered by the low level tradewind flow to the south 
of a vast subtropical ridge spanning much of the Pacific. The track 
guidance remains tightly clustered and the latest official forecast 
is very similar to the previous.

The UW-CIMSS shear analysis shows Hone is already in an environment 
of moderate shear. Over the next few days, Hone will continue to 
skirt along the southern periphery of the subtropical jet, 
subjecting the system to increasing westerly shear. This should 
continue the weakening trend, despite a gradual increase in sea 
surface temperatures along the forecast track. The intensity 
forecast continues to agree well with the statistical and dynamical 
guidance, and dissipation is expected as a remnant low late in the 
week.

Mahalo to both the U.S. Air Force Reserve and NOAA Hurricane 
Hunters for gathering much critical data from Tropical Cyclone Hone 
the last few days.

Hurricane Gilma Discussion Number  33
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072024
1100 PM HST Sun Aug 25 2024
 
This evening's satellite presentation consists of a ragged
partially obscured eye with a small inner core open in the south
semi-circle.  Gilma's cloud pattern continues to deteriorate slowly
and has shed most of the associated convective bands with the
exception of fragmented curved band wrapping in from the south.
The initial intensity is lowered to 85 kt and is based on the
Dvorak satellite intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB and a blend
of the UW-CIMSS ADT, AiDT, and DMINT objective estimates, yielding
83 kt.
 
Water vapor imagery and global model RH/700mb fields indicate that
the cyclone is moving toward a dry, stable air mass, indicative of
a large low-level stratocumulus cloud deck intruding from the
northwest in the GOES-18 Proxy-VIS images.  Subsequently, the
statistical GFS/ECMWF SHIPS indicated a mid-level/700-500mb RH of
42 percent.  This inhibiting thermodynamic contribution, along with
increasing west-to-west-southwesterly shear noted in the
statistical SHIPS intensity guidance, particularly beyond 36 hrs,
should cause Gilma to weaken at a quicker rate through day 5.
The NHC intensity forecast is a compromise of the Decay-SHIPS and
the IVCN intensity consensus and shows Gilma degenerating to a
post-tropical cyclone in 4 days.
 
Gilma's initial motion is estimated to be westward, or 280/8 kt,
and is moving in the southern periphery of a mid-tropospheric
subtropical ridge extending westward across the tropical-eastern
Pacific from northwestern Mexico.  The global and regional models
are fairly clustered together and indicate a slightly to the right
of the initial track motion, or west-northwestward beyond the 60 hr 
period, and the official forecast follows suit.  Along-track 
differences continue to be a model inconsistency, but following the 
skilled TVCE and HCCA consensus models have been the best track 
forecast solution so far.
 
Gilma's 50 kt wind radii have been slightly adjusted based on a 
0559 UTC METOP-C ASCAT overpass.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM HST (1800 UTC), the center of Hurricane Hone was located 
by Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft near latitude 18.5 
North, longitude 156.6 West. Hone is moving toward the west near 8 
mph (13 km/h). This general motion is expected to continue the next 
couple of days, with some increase in forward speed.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher
gusts. Hone is expected to gradually weaken the next couple of 
days. 

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115
miles (185 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 990 mb (29.23 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Hone can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header TCDCP1 and WMO header WTPA41
PHFO, and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/HFOTCDCP1.shtml.
 
WIND: Tropical Storm conditions will continue on the Big Island
through the morning hours. Winds are expected to be strongest
downslope of higher terrain, over headlands, and through passes.
 
RAINFALL: Hone is expected to produce an additional 3 to 6 inches 
of rainfall over mainly southeast and south facing slopes of the
Big Island. Additional rainfall of 1 to 3 inches will be possible 
over the smaller islands, mainly windward.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Hone are affecting portions of the 
Hawaiian islands, producing life-threatening surf and rip 
current conditions.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Valid 251627Z - 251830Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Intensifying renewed thunderstorm development is possible
across much of eastern Utah by 1-2 PM MDT.  Widely scattered
stronger storms may pose a risk for severe hail and wind while
spreading northeastward and eastward through late afternoon.  While
it is still not yet certain that a severe weather watch will be
needed, trends are being monitored for this possibility.

DISCUSSION...Downstream of a seasonably vigorous short wave trough
slowly progressing east-northeastward through the Great Basin, a
narrow band of large-scale ascent continues to gradually spread east
of the Wasatch.  This is in the wake of initial low-level warm
advection driven convection now spreading spreading northeastward
through the Colorado and adjacent Wyoming Rockies, with insolation
across a relatively moist boundary layer over much of eastern Utah
contributing to increasing destabilization.

Through 18-20Z, models suggest that mixed-layer CAPE may increase to
500-1000 J/kg, coincident with further strengthening of south to
southwesterly mid/upper wind fields (including 30-70+ kt in the
700-300 mb layer).  As new thunderstorm development begins to
initiate, it appears that this regime will become potentially
conducive to evolution of isolated supercells.  In addition to
posing a risk for large hail, stronger storms may become capable of
producing locally severe wind gusts, particularly as they spread
across the more strongly heated and deeply mixed lower elevations
through late afternoon.

Hurricane Gilma Discussion Number  30
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072024
500 AM HST Sun Aug 25 2024

Over the last 6 hours, Gilma's eye has continued to be present on 
most of the infrared and proxy vis images. However, the eye has 
become a bit more cloud-filled, and the convection over the 
southwestern eyewall is slightly less robust. Although the CI 
numbers from TAFB and SAB are still T-6.0/115 kt, the respective 
Final T numbers are lower than that. Recent UW-CIMSS objective 
intensity estimates range from 84 to 113 kt. Based on a blend of the 
subjective and objective intensity estimates, the initial intensity 
is nudged down slightly to 110 kt for this advisory.

Gilma is currently moving very near the 26C isotherm and is located 
in an environment of low vertical wind shear. The middle troposphere 
is fairly dry in the environment surrounding Gilma, but the cyclone 
has been able to prevent the dry air from entraining into the center 
enough to significantly disrupt the hurricane. The environmental 
conditions are not forecast to become more conducive for 
strengthening. Westerly vertical wind shear is forecast to increase 
slightly by late tonight or early Monday. SSTs should decrease 
slightly along the path of Gilma by late Monday or Monday night. 
Based on these factors, only slow weakening is forecast for the next 
24 h followed by more steady weakening after that. The confidence in 
the intensity forecast seems slightly below average in the 
short-term while Gilma straddles the 26C SST isotherm and remains in 
relatively low shear. In the 24 to 96 h time frame, Gilma should be 
weakening, but the rate at which it weakens is a bit uncertain. By 
day 4, vertical wind shear increases to moderate to strong, making 
it likely that Gilma should be significantly weaker in the 4- to 
5-day time frame. Gilma is forecast to lose its convection and 
become a remnant low by day 5. The NHC intensity forecast is similar 
to the previous one, perhaps showing a slightly slower rate of 
weakening in the 36-72 h period, closer to the latest intensity 
consensus guidance.

Gilma's initial motion is estimated to be westward, or 275/8 kt. A 
strengthening mid-tropospheric subtropical ridge situated to the 
north of the hurricane should steer Gilma on a westward to 
west-northwestward track through the forecast period. The official 
forecast is nearly unchanged from the previous advisory and is close 
to a blend of the TVCE and GFEX.

Hurricane Hone Discussion Number  13
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012024
500 AM HST Sun Aug 25 2024
 
Hone is passing by around 40 nautical miles south of South Point on 
the Big Island of Hawaii this morning, where it is within radar 
range. Combined radar, and data from an Air Force Reserve 
reconnaissance aircraft mission earlier this morning, support 
raising the initial intensity of Hone to 75 knots, keeping it a 
Category 1 Hurricane. Despite recent subjective Dvorak estimates 
suggesting a slightly lower intensity, the satellite presentation 
has evolved markedly overnight, with cold cloud tops near -75 C 
reinforcing the radar and aircraft-based intensities. The initial 
intensity is raised to 75 kt for this advisory.
 
The initial motion of Hone is set at 280/07. This westward 
trajectory is expected to persist over the coming days, influenced 
by a subtropical ridge to the north. However, as Hone remains near 
the Big Island through the early morning hours today, the 
mountainous terrain could influence local steering currents, 
potentially leading to localized and short-term deviations in the 
storm's motion and intensity. As we move into the early to mid 
portion of the week, Hone is projected to encounter increasing 
vertical wind shear, which is expected to weaken the storm and make 
it more shallow. This change in conditions will allow the low-level 
trade wind flow to steer the system toward the west-southwest. The 
official forecast track remains nearly identical to the previous 
advisory and is closely aligned with the tightly clustered consensus 
guidance.
 
Environmental conditions affecting Hone will remain steady over the 
next 12 to 24 h, with sea surface temperatures between 26 C and 27 
C, light to moderate vertical wind shear, and sufficient mid-level 
moisture. This supports maintaining a steady trend in intensity 
through the morning hours today. Although sea surface temperatures 
are forecast to rise to around 27 C tonight and beyond as Hone 
continues westward, increasing vertical wind shear will translate to 
a gradual weakening trend later today through the middle of the 
week. The intensity forecast closely follows dynamical consensus 
guidance.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Tropical Storm conditions will continue on the Big Island through 
the morning hours. Winds are expected to be strongest downslope of 
higher terrain, over headlands, and through passes.
 
2. Hone is expected to produce storm total rainfall of 6 to 12
inches over mainly windward and southeast facing slopes of the Big
Island, with locally higher amounts possible. Rainfall totals of 2
to 4 inches will be possible over portions of the smaller islands,
mainly windward.
 
3. Swells generated by Hone will continue today as this system 
continues westward. Expect dangerous conditions with 
life-threatening surf and rip currents.
