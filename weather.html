Mesoscale Discussion 0056
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0633 AM CST Tue Jan 28 2025

Areas affected...the Upper Michigan vicinity

Concerning...Heavy snow 

Valid 281233Z - 281700Z

SUMMARY...A period of heavy snow, at rates on the order of 1-2+
inches per hour, appears possible in a corridor overspreading the
central Upper Peninsula of Michigan vicinity by midday.

DISCUSSION...Downstream of a low-amplitude short wave perturbation,
accompanying an intense (110+ kt at 500 mb) jet streak digging
east-southeast of the Canadian Prairies, lower/mid-tropospheric warm
advection is overspreading the Upper Midwest into Great Lakes
region.  Associated forcing for ascent is becoming focused across
the southwestern flank of an arctic air mass now entrenched across
much of the Great Lakes region, particularly near a zone of strong
lower/mid-tropospheric frontogenesis, which is forecast to shift
from northwestern Ontario across the western Lake Superior and
central Upper Peninsula of Michigan vicinity through 17-18z.

Forecast soundings across this region indicate that the sub-freezing
thermodynamic profiles are in the process of saturating, ahead of an
ongoing band of moderate to heavy snow, which appears likely to be
maintained through at least early afternoon.  Temperatures appear
within a few degrees of -15C through an initially deep layer from
lower-levels into the 700-600 mb layer, where conditions will be
most conducive to large dendritic ice crystal growth.  Coinciding
with maximizing lift associated with the frontogenetic forcing, it
appears that this may support a 2-3 hour period of heavy snow rates
on the order of 1-2 inches per hour.  Forecast soundings also
indicate that a layer a steepening mid-level lapse rates may be
accompanied by the development of weak CAPE and embedded convective
development with heavier snow rates possible.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0637 AM CST Tue Jan 28 2025

Valid 281300Z - 291200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not forecast across the contiguous United
States through tonight.

...Synopsis...
Water-vapor imagery loop indicates a split flow upper-air pattern
over North America with a closed mid- to upper-level low meandering
over the Desert Southwest.  A few showers associated with the upper
low may become convectively augmented and yield a couple of
lightning flashes.  Otherwise, docile conditions will prevail across
the remainder of the Lower 48 from a thunderstorm perspective. 
Deep, cyclonic flow will encompass the Upper Midwest southeastward
into the Appalachians/Eastern Seaboard and maintain seasonably
cool/stable air via continental trajectories.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0146 AM CST Tue Jan 28 2025

Valid 291200Z - 301200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns are expected to be limited for Wednesday
across the country. The upper low currently over western Arizona
will shift into the southern Plains through Wednesday evening.
Widespread rain chances will overspread the southern Plains and
Southwest regions through the day limiting fire weather potential
for most areas. One exception is West Texas and south-central NM
where rainfall should be limited. While breezy southwest winds are
likely, recent guidance suggests the probability of reaching
elevated RH thresholds is low. Elsewhere across the country, cool
temperatures, weak winds, and/or recent rain/snowfall preclude fire
weather concerns.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0359 AM CST Sun Jan 26 2025

Valid 291200Z - 031200Z

...DISCUSSION...
...Wednesday/Day 4 to Thursday/Day 5...
A mid-level low is forecast to move eastward across the Desert
Southwest from Wednesday/Day 4 into Thursday/Day 5. Low-level
moisture advection will take place ahead of the system across the
southern Plains on Wednesday into Wednesday night, with surface
dewpoints increasing into the 60s F across parts of the southern
Plains. Scattered to numerous thunderstorms appear likely to develop
across the western part of the moist sector Wednesday night across
much of central and northern Texas, as large-scale ascent increases
ahead of the approaching system. This, combined with increasing
instability, and strong deep-layer shear along the western edge of
the moist sector should result in a severe threat late Wednesday
night. A cluster of strong and potentially severe storms may develop
in west-central Texas, with the severe threat persisting into
Thursday, as an MCS moves eastward across the southern Plains.
Supercells with isolated large hail and wind damage will be
possible. There is some concern that moisture return could be slower
than forecast. However, the strength of the system could help to
overcome instability concerns, and it appears a severe threat will
be possible as the mid-level jet ejects northeastward into the
southern Plains from Wednesday night into Thursday.

...Friday/Day 6 and Sunday/Day 8...
The mid-level trough is forecast to move across the southern Plains
on Friday/Day 6, as a cold front advances eastward into the lower
Mississippi Valley. On Saturday/Day 7 and Sunday/Day 8, this front
is forecast to move across the eastern U.S. Although thunderstorms
will be possible along and ahead of the front, instability is
forecast to be very weak suggesting a severe threat will be
unlikely.
