Day 1 Convective Outlook

Valid 121300Z - 131200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS PARTS OF THE
COASTAL CAROLINAS...CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS...THE EASTERN GREAT BASIN
NORTHWARD INTO PARTS OF THE NORTH-CENTRAL ROCKIES...AND NORTHERN
MONTANA...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms are possible today over parts of the
coastal Carolinas, central High Plains, the eastern Great Basin
northward into parts of the north-central Rockies, and northern
Montana.

...Rockies/Central High Plains Region...
Water-vapor imagery this morning depicts a flattened upper
anticyclone centered over east TX/LA and a large-scale trough over
the WA/OR/northern CA coast.  A notable mid-level disturbance will
move from the eastern Pacific east-northeastward into northern NV
during the period.  Mid-level flow ahead of the western U.S.
troughing will not be strong, but a plume of seasonably moist air
from the Four Corners northward into MT will favor scattered to
numerous thunderstorms developing this afternoon into the early
evening.  Heating will steepen 0-3 km lapse rates and promote severe
gusts with the stronger outflow surges from UT northward along the
ID/WY border.  Recent model guidance also indicates widely scattered
to scattered storms developing across northern MT and moving east as
a small thunderstorm cluster.  Localized severe gusts may accompany
this activity before weakening by early to mid evening.  Farther
east over the central High Plains, the maintenance of moist/upslope
flow into the High Plains and higher terrain (i.e., CO Front Range)
will promote isolated to scattered storms developing around peak
heating and moving into the adjacent High Plains.  An isolated risk
for large hail/severe gusts will be the primary hazards with the
stronger storms.  A cluster of storms will likely develop in
response to a nocturnal intensification of a LLJ but waning
instability by late evening will limit overall storm vigor.  

...Coastal Carolinas...
Southern influence of eastern US trough will glance this region
today as a belt of 20-30kt mid-level flow overspreads a very
moisture-rich airmass (i.e., mid to upper 70s deg F surface
dewpoints) south of a front.  Scattered thunderstorms should develop
along this boundary by early afternoon then propagate toward and off
the coast by early evening.  Marginally severe gusts could be noted
with the strongest storms.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook CORR 1

Valid 121200Z - 131200Z

CORRECTED FOR HEADLINE

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF NORTHWEST NEVADA...

...Synopsis...
A shortwave trough within broader cyclonic flow in the Northwest
will move through central California into western Nevada today. A
surface trough in the Northwest/northern Rockies will promote dry
and breezy conditions in parts of the northern Great Basin.

...Great Basin...
Broadly elevated fire weather conditions are expected over much of
Nevada into far southern Idaho. Winds of 15-20 mph will be the most
common along with 10-20% RH during the afternoon. A small region of
northwest Nevada may experience briefly critical conditions as both
the terrain and the mid-level jet help to enhance surface winds to
20-25 mph.

...Northwest...
Forcing for ascent from the upper trough will promote isolated
thunderstorms from north-central California into central Idaho. With
the mid-level jet more focused in northern Nevada, storm motions
will not be overly fast. A mix of wet and dry thunderstorms are most
probable. Recent CAM guidance also differs on the exact degree of
coverage, but enough confidence in at least isolated activity is
present for highlights.

Day 1 Convective Outlook

Valid 110100Z - 111200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
INTERMOUNTAIN WEST INTO THE HIGH PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms, capable of localized severe gusts and
perhaps hail, remain possible this evening over parts of the
Intermountain West and into the High Plains.

...01z Update...

Mid-level short-wave trough is advancing east across the northern
intermountain region early this evening. This feature is beginning
to flatten the ridge over western WY and scattered convection has
responded downstream where boundary-layer heating is maximized. 00z
sounding from SLC exhibits near dry adiabatic lapse rate in the
lowest 4km, and modest deep-layer shear; although, PW values are not
particularly high with values around one inch. Latest diagnostic
data suggests pockets of MLCAPE around 500 J/kg extend from southern
MT into eastern CO where considerably more buoyancy exists,
especially across southeast CO into the northern TX Panhandle.
Several gusts have exceeded 50kt with convection late this afternoon
and this remains the primary concern for the next several hours.
After sunset, boundary-layer cooling should hinder convective gusts
as 0-3km lapse rates weaken.
