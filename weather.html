Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0653 AM CDT Tue Mar 11 2025

Valid 111300Z - 121200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated thunderstorms are expected across far southern California
and into Arizona today into tonight. Severe storms are not expected.

...Discussion...
A potent mid to upper-level low west of southern CA will move east
and evolve into an open trough and reach the AZ-NM/Sonora-Chihuahua
border vicinity by early Wednesday morning.  Isolated to widely
scattered showers associated with the cold core will spread east
during the day from southern CA into the lower CO Valley and
southwest AZ, and later into the Sonoran Desert/Mogollon Rim
tonight.  Deeper convection near and east of the mid-level cold
pocket will probably result in occasional lightning flashes. 
Elsewhere, quiescent conditions for thunderstorm activity will
prevail.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0151 AM CDT Mon Mar 10 2025

Valid 111200Z - 121200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR EXTREME SOUTHEAST ARIZONA INTO
CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN NEW MEXICO...

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough over the eastern Pacific will rapidly approach
the CONUS and impinge on the Desert Southwest tomorrow (Tuesday),
encouraging surface low development across the southern Plains. As
this occurs, dry downslope flow from the southern Rockies will
overspread portions of the southern High Plains, promoting
wildfire-spread potential. By afternoon peak heating,
west-southwesterly surface winds in the 15-25 mph range will become
common, along with RH dipping to 5-15 percent. Critical fire weather
highlights have been introduced where guidance consensus shows 20+
mph sustained surface winds overlapping with 10 percent RH for at
least a few hours Tuesday afternoon.
