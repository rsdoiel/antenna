Tropical Storm Gilma Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072024
800 AM PDT Mon Aug 19 2024

Recent AMSR and SSMIS imagery indicate that Gilma's center is 
located near the northeast edge of its deep convection, with little 
deep convection present in its northeast quadrant. This is due, at 
least in part, to upper-level easterly winds that are causing some 
shear across the cyclone. A consensus of objective and subjective 
intensity estimates from SAB, TAFB, and UW-CIMSS support an initial 
intensity of 45 kt for this advisory, which also agree well with 
earlier ASCAT data.

The aforementioned wind shear is expected to persist for at least 
another day or two, which should limit the potential for 
strengthening. After around 36 h, global models indicate the shear 
will begin to decrease, which should allow for more strengthening. 
The exact timing of this strengthening is still highly uncertain, 
with several global models suggesting it could begin near the 36 h 
mark, while the HWRF indicates it won't begin to strengthen until 
closer to 60 h. Regardless, there is a good chance that Gilma will 
become a hurricane at some point before the end of the week. No 
significant changes were made to the intensity forecast, which 
follows the HCCA and IVCN intensity models. 

The track forecast is also largely unchanged from the previous NHC 
advisory. Gilma is currently moving west near 12 kt. A ridge 
extending westward from the southwest United States should keep 
Gilma on a similar heading today. After that, the tropical storm 
may interact with another disturbance to its west, while a trough 
off the U.S. west coast will begin to erode the ridge slightly. All 
models indicate that Gilma will generally slow down and turn 
west-northwestward in response to these steering changes, but there 
is unusually high spread in the guidance on the exact track the 
cyclone will take. The NHC track forecast follows the consensus 
aids, but confidence in the specifics of the forecast is lower than 
normal due to the high model spread.

Valid 191300Z - 201200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR PORTIONS OF
WESTERN INTO NORTH-CENTRAL MONTANA...EASTERN MONTANA...AND EASTERN
COLORADO...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are possible across portions of
Montana and eastern Colorado during the afternoon and evening. 
Large hail and severe gusts are the primary hazards.

...Synopsis...
Water-vapor imagery this morning shows a mid- to upper-level ridge
situated over the south-central High Plains northward through the
northern Great Plains.  A mid-level trough is over the East and a
mid-level low and associated trough are over the eastern Pacific to
the west of the Pacific Northwest.  

...Portions of the central and northern Rockies/High Plains...
Broad 40+ kt southwesterly 500 mb flow will overspread portions of
the central into the northern Rockies as an impulse embedded in the
West Coast mid-level trough grazes the region.  Isolated to
scattered thunderstorms are forecast across Montana with locally
greater thunderstorm coverage forecast over western into
north-central MT this afternoon and evening, and separately over
portions of eastern Montana.  Richer moisture is evident in morning
surface analysis across eastern MT where lower 60s F surface
dewpoints are present with mid 50s farther west near the I-15
corridor.  Consequently, greater buoyancy is expected later this
afternoon over eastern MT with 2000+ J/kg MLCAPE possible with
750-1250 J/kg farther west.  Given the deep boundary layer and
corresponding steep lapse rates in both areas, severe gusts are
possible with the more intense cells and clusters, especially if a
linear cluster can evolve near the Rocky Mtn Front and push
northeastward into the High Plains.  Elsewhere, isolated instances
of hail/wind may accompany the stronger thunderstorms from the
eastern Great Basin northward into ID/WY.  

...Eastern Colorado...
Moist upslope flow during peak surface heating will result in
thunderstorm initiation off of the higher terrain.  Surface
dewpoints in the low 60s F beneath 7.5-8 C/km mid-level lapse rates
will support over 2000 J/kg MLCAPE.  Modest veering and
strengthening of the vertical wind profile will contribute to 30-40
kts of effective bulk shear and modestly elongated hodographs. Some
of the stronger multicells and transient supercells may yield a risk
for large hail and severe gusts beginning mid afternoon through the
early evening.

...North Carolina into the Northeast...
At least scattered thunderstorms will develop amid weak vertical
wind shear this afternoon ahead of a cold front.  Pulse cellular and
occasional multicells are the expected storm mode. Rich low-level
moisture preceding the front will contribute to 1000-2000 J/kg
MLCAPE, which may support a few strong, potentially damaging gusts
with some of the stronger storms.

...North Florida...
A couple of strong thunderstorms may develop along the trailing
portion of a cold front by afternoon. Similar to the Northeast, rich
low-level moisture will promote 2000-3000 J/kg MLCAPE, fostering wet
downburst/strong wind gust potential with pulse single cells and
multicells.

...Sabine River Valley...
Ongoing clusters of weak thunderstorms moving southward on the
backside of the Eastern U.S. mid-level trough will likely continue
southward through the Sabine River Valley today.  Although the 12
UTC Lake Charles raob is characterized as only weakly unstable,
additional heating will result in moderate destabilization by
midday.  A localized wind-damage risk may accompany the stronger
outflow surges before this activity moves into the northwest Gulf.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM THE MIDDLE
ATLANTIC TO THE DEEP SOUTH...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered wind damage will be possible from the Mid-Atlantic States
to the Deep South from mid-afternoon to early evening on Sunday.

...Middle Atlantic to Deep South...

Great Lakes/OH Valley upper trough will shift east today with a
19/00z position forecast along the spine of the Appalachians. Modest
500mb flow should extend within the base of the trough into the
Middle Atlantic. This flow regime will aid the organizational
potential of convection that evolves ahead of the primary synoptic
front. Latest model guidance suggests a weak surface low may develop
over northern VA/MD by late afternoon and this feature should track
into NJ during the overnight hours. While deep-layer flow is not
forecast to be exceptionally strong, 0-6km bulk shear will exceed
30kt within a warm-advection zone. Forecast soundings favor storm
rotation and a few supercells may ultimately evolve across this
region. In addition to damaging wind threat, some risk for hail and
perhaps a brief tornado can be expected.

Trailing front across the Deep South will not be particularly
convergent as it surges into GA-AL-MS. Pre-frontal boundary layer
will be adequately buoyant for robust updrafts and any storms that
evolve ahead of the wind shift will do so within an environment that
favors some organization. Convection will propagate southeast toward
the Gulf Coast as northwesterly flow deepens with trough passage.

...Rockies/Central Plains...

Water-vapor imagery depicts a well-defined short-wave trough topping
the Rockies ridge over western WY at this time. This feature will
track southeast across the central Plains this afternoon as a 500mb
speed max translates into the lower MO Valley. LLJ will respond to
this feature which should contribute to an extensive zone of
elevated convection early in the period. This activity will
propagate southeast along a sharp corridor of warm advection into
eastern KS, then into the lower MS Valley during the overnight
hours. Have increased severe probabilities to account for this
evolution. Primary concern is damaging winds.

...Interior West...

Isolated strong/locally severe thunderstorms will once again develop
across western UT and track north-northeast along the
western/northern periphery of the dominant anticyclone. Gusty winds
are possible with this diurnally enhanced activity.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ALONG/JUST EAST OF
THE WASHINGTON/OREGON CASCADES...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms will spread across portions of
southwest Washington this evening. Hail/wind remain possible.
Isolated damaging gusts are also expected with convection across
portions of the southern Appalachians into the Ohio Valley.

...01z Update...

Notable short-wave trough is currently ejecting north across
northern CA into western OR. Water-vapor imagery also suggests a
lead disturbance may be associated with a fairly extensive cluster
of deep convection as it advances across northern OR into southwest
WA. Surface temperatures are holding in the lower 90s across lower
elevations of southern WA east of the Cascades. Latest diagnostic
data suggests a narrow corridor of higher instability extends
along/just east of the Cascades. While convection should
spread/develop north along the higher terrain, northeasterly
low-level flow should contribute to robust updrafts capable of
generating hail/wind.

Northwesterly flow is deepening across the southern Appalachians
early this evening as the upper trough progresses steadily east. A
broken band of organized convection is propagating southeast across
northwestern SC/northern GA through an axis of instability
characterized by 1500 MLCAPE. This activity may produce locally
damaging gusts for the next few hours, but otherwise will gradually
decrease in intensity as boundary layer cools this evening.

More isolated convection is observed across KY into the upper OH
Valley. This activity will also gradually wane in intensity as the
evening progresses and low-level lapse rates weaken. Until then, a
few gusts may be noted.
