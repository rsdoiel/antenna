Hurricane Carlotta Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032024
800 AM PDT Fri Aug 02 2024
 
Since the previous advisory, Carlotta's structure on satellite
imagery has improved, with a banding eye showing up on both infrared
and visible frames. We have been also receiving helpful surface
observations from Isla Clarion which earlier reported sustained
winds of 47 kt with a gust of 71 kt and a minimum pressure of 986 mb
as Carlotta passed by just to the north. These data, along with
subjective and objective intensity estimates in the 65-77 kt range
are the basis to increase the initial intensity to 70 kt, making
Carlotta the first hurricane of the East Pacific season.
 
Carlotta continues to move west-northwestward, estimated at 
285/12-kt. This heading with a gradual slowdown is expected to 
continue for the next several days as the hurricane remains 
influenced by a large deep-layer ridge centered over the 
southwestern United States. The track guidance this cycle has not 
changed much other than another subtle shift north again, and the 
NHC track forecast was nudged again in that direction.
 
The small hurricane has an opportunity to intensify further over the 
next day or so while it remains over warm ocean waters and low to 
moderate vertical wind shear. Similar to the previous advisory, the 
NHC forecast continues to show a peak intensity as a Category 2 
hurricane in 24-36 hours. However beyond that time, sea-surface 
temperatures decrease under 26 C and continue to cool as the 
environmental moisture becomes increasingly dry and stable. Thus, 
weakening should begin in earnest after that time period, with the 
system becoming post-tropical as it loses its remaining convection 
by the end of the forecast period.

Tropical Storm Carlotta Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032024
800 AM MST Thu Aug 01 2024
 
After intensifying over the past 12 to 18 hours, Carlotta is taking
a brief pause as the inner-core becomes better established, though
the system is still quite healthy looking on satellite imagery with
plenty of curved bands around a formative central dense overcast
(CDO). A blend of the latest subjective Dvorak intensity estimates
still support an intensity of 50-kt this advisory, which is also
roughly in the middle of objective intensity guidance.
 
Carlotta continues to move west-northwestward at 295/10-kt. This
motion is caused by a prominent deep-layer ridge located over the
southwestern United States, and Carlotta may turn more back westward
over the next few days as this ridge continues to strengthen.
However by day 3 and beyond, the tropical cyclone will begin to
feel a weakness to the north, which will likely result in a gradual
slowdown in its forward motion and another gentle shift more
poleward in the track. The latest track guidance is ever so slightly
further north and faster compared to the previous cycle. Thus, the
NHC track forecast has been shifted a bit in that direction,
roughly in between the prior track forecast, and the reliable
consensus aids TVCE and HCCA.
 
Environmental conditions still appear quite favorable for 
intensification, with warm 28-29 C sea-surface temperatures (SSTs), 
and low to moderate shear between 10-15 kt out of the northwest. The 
rate of intensification may be determined more by how Carlotta's 
inner-core evolves, and there have not been any recent microwave 
images to diagnose the current structure. The SHIPS rapid 
intensification index is a little lower than last night, though this 
could also be in response to the temporary pause in the 
intensification. However the last few GOES-18 images suggest the CDO 
is becoming better established though an eye has yet to fully appear 
on first-light visible imagery. Even though the intensity guidance 
has shifted a little lower than last night, I have elected to keep 
the same intensification rate in the NHC forecast from the last 
cycle over the next 24 hours. This forecast is in better agreement 
with the regional-hurricane models HAFS-A/B versus the lower 
consensus aids that have been influenced by the lower SHIPS and LGEM 
guidance. After 48-60 hours, SSTs begin to markedly decrease along 
the forecast track, dropping under 26 C in 96 hours. Thus, the NHC 
intensity forecast shows gradual weakening between days 3 to 5.

Tropical Storm Carlotta Advisory Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032024
800 AM MST Thu Aug 01 2024
 
...CARLOTTA STILL EXPECTED TO BECOME A HURRICANE BY TONIGHT OR
TOMORROW...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 800 AM MST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...17.2N 111.0W
ABOUT 455 MI...735 KM WSW OF MANZANILLO MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...60 MPH...95 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 290 DEGREES AT 12 MPH...19 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...997 MB...29.44 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM MST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Carlotta was
located near latitude 17.2 North, longitude 111.0 West. Carlotta is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h). This motion 
is expected to continue today, followed by a turn toward the west on 
Friday and a continued westward motion through the weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Strengthening is forecast during the next couple of days, and 
Carlotta is expected to become a hurricane either tonight or 
tomorrow.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 997 mb (29.44 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF: Swells generated by Carlotta will affect the coasts of
west-central mainland Mexico and the southern Baja California
peninsula beginning later today. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions through the
weekend. Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 200 PM MST.

Mesoscale Discussion 1763
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0956 AM CDT Wed Jul 31 2024

Areas affected...central Indiana

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 311456Z - 311630Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Locally gusty winds of 40-60 mph are possible across parts
of central Indiana through early afternoon. Severe thunderstorm
watch issuance is uncertain.

DISCUSSION...A cluster of storms near the IL/IN border will continue
to track east/southeast the next few hours. Overall structure and
organization of this activity has decreased compared to
overnight/earlier this morning. Measured wind gusts with this
activity have mostly been in the 30-40 kt range, with a couple
locally higher gusts. The downstream environment remains weakly to
moderately capped with deep-layer flow relatively weak (less than 30
kt effective shear). With continued heating, inhibition should
gradually decrease. However, instability and shear are expected to
remain somewhat modest. While some minor intensification is
possible, timing and coverage of any greater severe risk is
uncertain. Severe thunderstorm watch issuance is not expected in the
short term, but trends will be monitored and watch issuance is
possible later this morning or afternoon if trends increase
sufficiently.

Tropical Depression Three-E Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032024
800 AM MST Wed Jul 31 2024
 
Over the last few hours, the convective organization has improved 
with the area of low pressure we have been monitoring a few hundred 
miles off the southwestern coast of Mexico. First-light visible 
imagery from a GOES-West meso-sector over the storm show the 
development of organized curve banding, with low-level cloud motions 
also now suggesting the presence of closed cyclonic flow. This 
improved convective structure was also seen in an earlier 1040 UTC 
SSMIS microwave pass. In addition, the latest set of subjective 
Dvorak intensity estimates were both at T2.5/35 kt from both SAB and 
TAFB. All these data suggest that the system has become a tropical 
cyclone, and advisories are being initiated at this time. The 
initial intensity for this advisory is set at 30 kt, a little under 
the Dvorak estimates given the lower objective estimates and 
earlier scatterometer data.
 
The initial estimated motion is off to the west-northwest at 
295/12-kt. This motion is expected to continue with a gentle 
turn more westward over the next few days as the system becomes 
primarily steered by a deep-layer ridge located over the 
southwestern United States. Towards the end of the forecast period, 
there could be a bit more of a weakness in this ridge on its 
western extent, potentially allowing the system to turn more 
poleward again. The initial track forecast in general sticks close 
to the consensus aids TVCE and HCCA, which favor a track that is in 
between the operational GFS and ECMWF tracks, but slightly in favor 
of the latter.
 
Intensity-wise, TD3-E might be our first system in the East Pacific 
to last longer than a couple of days, with most of the guidance 
suggesting intensification into the weekend. SHIPS guidance from 
both the GFS and ECMWF suggest the shear will remain low (less than 
15 kt) while sea-surface temperatures underneath the cyclone remain 
in the 29-30 C range over the next few days. Such a favorable 
environment could favor significant intensification once an 
inner-core becomes established. Interestingly, the 
regional-hurricane model guidance, while showing intensification, do 
not currently forecast rapid intensification. The first NHC 
intensity forecast shows more gradual intensification for the next 
day or so, followed by a somewhat faster rate, peaking the system as 
a Category 1 hurricane in 72 h, on the high end of the intensity 
guidance.  Towards the end of the forecast, the tropical cyclone 
should begin to move over cooler ocean waters, with gradual 
weakening expected to begin around day 4 or 5.

Mesoscale Discussion 1743
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1139 AM CDT Tue Jul 30 2024

Areas affected...Pennsylvania...Maryland...and Virginia...including
Washington D.C.

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 301639Z - 301845Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Initially isolated thunderstorms should increase in
coverage through the afternoon hours with an accompanying increase
in damaging wind potential. Watch issuance is not anticipated given
a weak kinematic environment.

DISCUSSION...GOES imagery and lightning data over the past 30-60
minutes have shown steadily deepening/intensifying convection along
a residual outflow boundary and weak surface trough from central PA
southward into VA. While ongoing convection currently appears to be
sub-severe based on MRMS hail metrics and regional velocity data,
temperatures warming into the low 80s should promote SBCAPE values
up to 2000 J/kg that will likely result in additional thunderstorm
development as well as some degree of intensification through the
day with an attendant potential for damaging wind gusts. Given weak
deep-layer flow over the region, overall convective intensity will
likely be influenced primarily by low-level heating/destabilization.
This will be modulated by how quickly residual low-level stratus can
clear ahead of developing storms. If stronger diurnal heating can be
achieved (i.e. surface temperatures into the mid/upper 80s) then
higher SBCAPE (possibly up to 3000 J/kg) and steeper low-level lapse
rates will likely favor more intense convection with a relatively
higher damaging wind threat. Regardless, watch issuance is not
anticipated given the meager deep-layer wind shear and uncertainty
regarding the thermodynamic environment.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 569
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1005 AM CDT Tue Jul 30 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Southern Indiana
  North-Central Kentucky

* Effective this Tuesday morning and afternoon from 1005 AM until
  400 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...A small bowing cluster of thunderstorms should continue to
pose a risk for mainly scattered damaging winds up to 60-70 mph as
it moves quickly east-southeastward through the rest of the morning
and into the afternoon. Isolated severe hail may occur as well.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 35
statute miles north and south of a line from 110 miles west
northwest of Louisville KY to 25 miles east of Louisville KY. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU9).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 568...

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
1.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
30040.

Mesoscale Discussion 1742
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0909 AM CDT Tue Jul 30 2024

Areas affected...portions of southern Illinois and southern Indiana
into north-central Kentucky

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 567...

Valid 301409Z - 301615Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 567
continues.

SUMMARY...Severe thunderstorms posing a damaging wind risk will
persist across southern Illinois within Severe Thunderstorm Watch
567. Areas across southern Indiana into adjacent north-central
Kentucky are being monitored for possible downstream watch issuance.

DISCUSSION...A small, but well organized bowing cluster of storms
continues to track east/southeast across south-central Illinois this
morning. This activity has produced gusts near 50 kt within the past
hour. Around 30 kt effective shear magnitudes are likely sustaining
organized activity as convection shifts east/southeast along an
instability gradient oriented northwest to southeast across the
lower Ohio Valley vicinity. A very moist downstream airmass is
evident, with surface dewpoints in the 70s. With continued heating,
boundary-layer inhibition is expected to quickly erode by midday.
Damaging gusts may continue downstream of ongoing activity,
especially if additional convection can develop on the southern
flank of the ongoing cluster. Visible satellite imagery shows
deepening cumulus ahead of the southern flank, so this evolution
appears plausible. A downstream watch may be needed within the next
hour or so if current trends persist/increase.

Mesoscale Discussion 1741
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0847 AM CDT Tue Jul 30 2024

Areas affected...portions of southern Iowa...northern Missouri...and
extreme west-central Illinois

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 301347Z - 301515Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Damaging gusts are possible this morning and afternoon as
a cluster of storms tracks southeast across southern Iowa into
northern Missouri and extreme west-central Illinois. A watch may be
needed this morning, though timing is uncertain.

DISCUSSION...A well organized cluster of storms currently moving
into central Iowa has produced gusts near 50 kt within the past 30
minutes or so. This activity may be somewhat elevated in the wake of
overnight convection. Nevertheless, 35-45 kt effective shear
magnitudes and MLCAPE around 1000-1500 J/kg will likely maintain
organization. While outflow from overnight convection has surged
southward to near I-70 in Missouri, the airmass has shown signs of
quick recovery, with surface dewpoints in the mid/upper 60s F noted
in 13z surface obs. Clear skies ahead of the cluster will also allow
for quick heating through the morning hours. As a result, downstream
destabilization and erosion of capping is expected. 

The ongoing cluster of storms may continue to gradually intensify
and pose a risk for damaging gusts into late morning/early afternoon
as the downstream airmass continue to recover/destabilize. Given the
effect of overnight convection on the airmass, there is some
uncertainty in convective evolution and timing of possible watch
issuance. Nevertheless, it appears possible a severe thunderstorm
watch could be needed this morning across parts of the discussion
area.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0158 AM CDT Mon Jul 29 2024

Valid 301200Z - 311200Z

...Synopsis...
A midlevel trough will advance eastward across the northern Rockies
and adjacent High Plains during the day, while broad/enhanced
west-southwesterly flow aloft persists across the Great Basin.

...Northern Rockies/Intermountain West... 
Large-scale ascent accompanying the eastward-moving midlevel trough
will promote widely scattered thunderstorms across portions of the
northern Rockies/Intermountain West into the northern Plains during
the afternoon and evening. While many of these storms will be
capable of producing measurable rainfall, quick eastward-moving
storms (around 25-35 mph) will still favor a mix of wet/dry
thunderstorms over dry fuels. As a result, some lightning-induced
ignitions will be possible -- especially along the peripheries of
any rain cores.

...Great Basin...
Boundary-layer mixing into the modestly enhanced west-southwesterly
flow aloft will lead to locally dry/breezy conditions across parts
of the Great Basin during the afternoon. While locally elevated
conditions are possible, winds should be slightly weaker than the
day prior, and the overall threat appears too localized for an
Elevated area at this time.
