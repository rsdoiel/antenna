Mesoscale Discussion 1889
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0634 PM CDT Mon Aug 12 2024

Areas affected...Northeastern Colorado

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 122334Z - 130100Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...A supercell thunderstorm capable of damaging winds, hail,
and perhaps a tornado is tracking southward across portions of
northeast Colorado. Given the isolated nature of this storm, weather
watch issuance is not likely.

DISCUSSION...The severe weather threat associated with a
southward-moving supercell in northeast Colorado may persist for the
next 1-2 hours. The storm has exhibited signs of prolonged low-level
rotation, has produced 2.00 inch hail, and is moving into an
environment that will continue to support updraft rotation. Forecast
proximity hodographs indicate there is sufficient curvature of the
low-level flow and streamwise vorticity to support continued
low-level mesocyclone development and cycling. Both the curvature
and magnitude of the low-level hodograph is expected to increase as
the nocturnal low-level jet strengthens with the decoupling of the
boundary-layer. However, recent radar trends suggest the storm is
struggling to stay ahead of its own outflow, where temperatures are
15-20 F cooler than unmodified inflow. This supercell will likely
undergo several phases of organized low-level rotation, followed by
surging outflow, until the boundary-layer eventually stabilizes this
evening and convection becomes more elevated in nature.

Mesoscale Discussion 1888
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0513 PM CDT Mon Aug 12 2024

Areas affected...North-central Montana

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 122213Z - 130015Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...A potential will exist for marginally severe gusts and
hail early this evening across parts of north-central Montana. No
watch issuance is anticipated.

DISCUSSION...The latest water-vapor imagery shows a subtle shortwave
trough over the northern Rockies, embedded in southwest mid-level
flow. At the surface, a mesolow is analyzed over north-central
Montana, with upslope east-southeasterly flow located across much of
northern and eastern Montana. Isolated thunderstorms have developed
near and to the north of the low along a narrow corridor of
instability, where the RAP is estimating SBCAPE in the 1000 to 1500
J/kg range. Short-term forecast soundings in north-central Montana
early this evening have a relatively dry boundary layer, but show
steep lapse rates and moderate deep-layer shear. This may be enough
for a marginal severe threat for a few hours. Strong gusts and hail
will be possible.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0218 PM CDT Mon Aug 12 2024

Valid 141200Z - 151200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS
OF THE CENTRAL/NORTHERN PLAINS INTO THE MID-MISSOURI VALLEY...

...SUMMARY...
At least isolated severe thunderstorms may occur Wednesday across
parts of the northern/central Plains into the mid Missouri Valley.

...Synopsis...
A band of elevated thunderstorms will likely be ongoing at the
beginning of the period across a broad region of isentropic ascent
from southeast South Dakota to southern Missouri. As the low-level
jet weakens through the morning, expect the intensity of these
storms to lessen as they move east into a more stable airmass. To
the west, an unstable airmass is forecast across much of the central
and northern Plains in the vicinity of a broad surface trough. At
least weak to moderate instability is forecast with the potential
for greater instability in eastern NE/KS where higher dewpoints
(upper 60s to low 70s) are forecast.

The breakdown of the upper-level ridge will lead to height falls
across much of the central and northern Plains. Given the unstable
environment across much of the area, this weak upper-level forcing
combined with the surface trough will likely result in scattered
thunderstorms across much of the central and northern Plains
Wednesday afternoon/evening. A more focused threat may exist farther
south across eastern Kansas in Nebraska. Some enhancement of the
mid-level flow ahead of the ridge breakdown may lead to a localized
region of more favorable wind shear, co-located with the forecast
greater instability. If this occurs, particularly with the
development of a surface low as forecast by the NAM/ECMWF, a locally
greater severe weather threat may occur across this region. At this
time, uncertainty in the mesoscale features which will impact this
potential are too great to warrant higher severe weather
probabilities.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0327 PM CDT Mon Aug 12 2024

Valid 141200Z - 201200Z

The potential for widespread critical fire weather conditions
remains low through the extended period. Long-range ensemble
guidance continues to suggest mean troughing will become established
along the West Coast with upper ridging over the southern and
central CONUS through the work week and into next weekend. This
synoptic regime will favor widespread rain/thunderstorm chances for
much of the country with the exception of NV/CA and portions of
central TX.

...D4/Thursday - Pacific Northwest...
The evolving synoptic regime will favor multiple weak upper
disturbances propagating across the northern Great Basin as an upper
low slowly amplifies off the West Coast through the work week and
into the upcoming weekend. Multiple runs from the GFS/ECMWF/Canadian
model families (and associated ensembles) have shown a consistent
signal for convection across portions of OR on D4/Thursday as one
such disturbances moves across the region. While the probability for
convection is somewhat meager (around 40% based on blended ensemble
guidance), forecast PWAT values and QPF probabilities suggest that
thunderstorms that do development may be dry and pose a fire weather
concern given antecedent dry fuels and recent lighting starts across
this region. Low (10%) risk highlights have been introduced to
address this concern.

...Great Basin...
The evolving synoptic regime will favor multiple weak upper
disturbances propagating across the northern Great Basin as an upper
low slowly amplifies off the West Coast through the work week and
into the upcoming weekend. This will support multiple days of breezy
conditions across the Great Basin - primarily across NV - where
conditions should remain dry (RH in the low teens to low 20s) within
a persistent downslope flow regime off the Sierra Nevada. Areas of
elevated fire weather conditions appear possible each day, but the
synoptic regime will favor weak low-level mass responses and modest
surface winds. 

...Texas...
Ensemble guidance continues to show a strong signal for dry
conditions and afternoon high temperatures returning into the low
100s through the upcoming weekend. These hot/dry conditions will
support drying most fuels, especially grasses across west to
northwest TX where the hottest conditions are expected. The building
upper ridge will limit the potential for widespread, strong gradient
winds, but trends forecast wind speeds and fuels will be monitored.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
COASTAL CAROLINAS...CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS...EASTERN GREAT BASIN
NORTHWARD INTO PARTS OF THE NORTH-CENTRAL ROCKIES...AND NORTHERN
MONTANA...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms are possible today over parts of the
coastal Carolinas, central High Plains, the eastern Great Basin
northward into parts of the north-central Rockies, and northern
Montana.

...20z Update...
No changes are needed to the Day 1 Outlook.

Marginal risk for strong to severe gusts and large hail will
continue through the afternoon across the central High
Plains/Central Plains as well as the Intermountain West into the
northern High Plains. See MCD#1186 and MCD#1885 for more
information.

Additional thunderstorm development is expected across a front
portions of South Carolina this afternoon. Ahead of this boundary,
the air mass has destabilized, with around 2000 J/kg of MLCAPE and
20-30 kts of deep layer shear. Thunderstorms will be capable of
instances of strong to severe wind.

..Thornton/Mosier.. 08/12/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1129 AM CDT Mon Aug 12 2024/

...Central High Plains/Central Plains...
Upslope flow will persist across the central High Plains, helping to
maintain moderate low-level moisture across region. Afternoon
dewpoints are expected to range from the upper 60s in the southeast
CO/northeast NM/western Panhandles vicinity to the mid to upper 50s
across eastern WY. This low-level moisture will help support
moderate buoyancy during the afternoon/evening, although some
limited capping may linger. Thunderstorms are expected to develop
across the higher terrain before then progressing eastward into the
more moist and buoyant airmass downstream. Generally moderate
deep-layer vertical shear coupled with the potential for some
remaining convective inhibition suggest the severe potential will
remain isolated, with damaging gusts and/or large hail as the
primary severe risks. 

Thunderstorms will likely persist eastward into more of the central
Plains, supported by moderate buoyancy and shear and the development
of modest low-level jet. Isolated instances of large hail are
possible, but the overall storm severity will likely be tempered by
limited instability. 

...Intermountain West into the Northern High Plains...
Morning satellite imagery depicts upper ridging centered over TX
covering much of the southern third of the CONUS and also extending
northward into MT. Several shortwave troughs are moving through the
westerlies within the northern periphery of this ridging, including
a low-amplitude shortwave currently moving into ID and
northern/central NV and another, more defined shortwave farther west
off the northern CA coast. Eastward/northeastward progression of
these waves will bring greater mid-level moisture and increased
large-scale forcing for ascent, supporting the development of
scattered to numerous thunderstorms across the region. Mid-level
flow will remain modest, but a few more organized/persistent
updrafts are possible. High cloud bases atop steep low-level lapse
rates could result in a few stronger gusts as these more persistent
storms form into clusters, particularly from northern/central UT
into far eastern ID and far western WY and northern MT.

...Coastal Carolinas...
Far southern periphery of an upper trough currently extending from
Quebec through the Upper OH Valley will glance this region today as
it progresses eastward. Modest (i.e. 20-30kt) mid-level flow will
overspread a moisture-rich airmass (i.e. PWs over 2") in place south
of a front. Scattered thunderstorms should develop along this
boundary by early afternoon then propagate toward and off the coast
by early evening. A few water-loaded downbursts capable of damaging
gusts could be noted with the strongest storms.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0228 PM CDT Mon Aug 12 2024

Valid 131200Z - 141200Z

An isolated dry thunderstorm risk area has been introduced to
portions of eastern OR into ID. Isolated thunderstorms will likely
be ongoing at the start of the period across far eastern OR, and
should migrate eastward over the central ID mountains through the
afternoon with little in the way of wetting rainfall given fast
storm motions. 

A second round of convection remains possible during the late
afternoon across southeast OR/southwest ID, and will likely feature
dry convection given forecast PWAT values at/below 0.6 inch. While
ensemble guidance has trended towards higher probability for this to
occur, the overall signal remains fairly weak.

..Moore.. 08/12/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1252 AM CDT Mon Aug 12 2024/

...Synopsis...
On Tuesday, the upper trough will lift out of the northern Great
Basin and into the northern High Plains, all while losing amplitude.
While some increase in mid-level winds may occur over the Great
Basin, this will not occur until late in the period. At the surface,
the pressure pattern will be more disorganized than Monday and
stronger winds will likely be diurnally/terrain-driven.

...Nevada...
Areas of locally elevated fire weather are possible as RH will still
fall to 15-20% during the afternoon. Slightly stronger winds appear
possible in southern Nevada, but fuels are also less receptive than
farther north. Sustained elevated conditions are not currently
expected.

...Central Idaho...
With the mid-level trough moving through early in the period,
mid/upper-level cloud cover will be possible. This may impact
destabilization enough to reduce potential storm coverage during the
afternoon. Should storms occur, some could be dry. Confidence in
coverage is too low for highlights.

Far southern periphery of an upper trough currently extending from
Quebec through the Upper OH Valley will glance this region today as
it progresses eastward. Modest (i.e. 20-30kt) mid-level flow will
overspread a moisture-rich airmass (i.e. PWs over 2") in place south
of a front. Scattered thunderstorms should develop along this
boundary by early afternoon then propagate toward and off the coast
by early evening. A few water-loaded downbursts capable of damaging
gusts could be noted with the strongest storms.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR WESTERN NEVADA...

The primary forecast change for this update is an expansion of the
dry-thunderstorm risk area across portions of the Pacific Northwest
and northern Rockies. Morning soundings from BOI, OTX, and MFR all
show cooler mid-level temperatures compared to the previous 24
hours, which should support thunderstorm chances today through
tonight as lift associated with an approaching trough overspreads
the region. GOES imagery also depicts a plume of 0.4 to 0.6 inch
PWAT values across northern CA into central ID that was well sampled
by the BOI sounding, and suggests a slightly better probability for
dry thunderstorms exists through this corridor. A few
lightning-related fire starts associated with a mix of wet/dry
thunderstorms have been reported over the past 24 hours across WA
and ID, and a lack of widespread wetting rainfall has maintained dry
fuels that will support a continued fire weather concern for today
and into the early morning hours Tuesday. 

Other minor adjustments include an expansion of the Elevated risk
area into the Snake River Plain of eastern ID where ensemble
guidance has shown a consistent signal for a few hours of dry
conditions with 15-20 mph winds. See the previous discussion for
additional details.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0124 AM CDT Mon Aug 12 2024/

...Synopsis...
A shortwave trough within broader cyclonic flow in the Northwest
will move through central California into western Nevada today. A
surface trough in the Northwest/northern Rockies will promote dry
and breezy conditions in parts of the northern Great Basin.

...Great Basin...
Broadly elevated fire weather conditions are expected over much of
Nevada into far southern Idaho. Winds of 15-20 mph will be the most
common along with 10-20% RH during the afternoon. A small region of
northwest Nevada may experience briefly critical conditions as both
the terrain and the mid-level jet help to enhance surface winds to
20-25 mph.

...Northwest...
Forcing for ascent from the upper trough will promote isolated
thunderstorms from north-central California into central Idaho. With
the mid-level jet more focused in northern Nevada, storm motions
will not be overly fast. A mix of wet and dry thunderstorms are most
probable. Recent CAM guidance also differs on the exact degree of
coverage, but enough confidence in at least isolated activity is
present for highlights.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS PARTS OF THE
COASTAL CAROLINAS...CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS...THE EASTERN GREAT BASIN
NORTHWARD INTO PARTS OF THE NORTH-CENTRAL ROCKIES...AND NORTHERN
MONTANA...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms are possible today over parts of the
coastal Carolinas, central High Plains, the eastern Great Basin
northward into parts of the north-central Rockies, and northern
Montana.

...Rockies/Central High Plains Region...
Water-vapor imagery this morning depicts a flattened upper
anticyclone centered over east TX/LA and a large-scale trough over
the WA/OR/northern CA coast.  A notable mid-level disturbance will
move from the eastern Pacific east-northeastward into northern NV
during the period.  Mid-level flow ahead of the western U.S.
troughing will not be strong, but a plume of seasonably moist air
from the Four Corners northward into MT will favor scattered to
numerous thunderstorms developing this afternoon into the early
evening.  Heating will steepen 0-3 km lapse rates and promote severe
gusts with the stronger outflow surges from UT northward along the
ID/WY border.  Recent model guidance also indicates widely scattered
to scattered storms developing across northern MT and moving east as
a small thunderstorm cluster.  Localized severe gusts may accompany
this activity before weakening by early to mid evening.  Farther
east over the central High Plains, the maintenance of moist/upslope
flow into the High Plains and higher terrain (i.e., CO Front Range)
will promote isolated to scattered storms developing around peak
heating and moving into the adjacent High Plains.  An isolated risk
for large hail/severe gusts will be the primary hazards with the
stronger storms.  A cluster of storms will likely develop in
response to a nocturnal intensification of a LLJ but waning
instability by late evening will limit overall storm vigor.  

...Coastal Carolinas...
Southern influence of eastern US trough will glance this region
today as a belt of 20-30kt mid-level flow overspreads a very
moisture-rich airmass (i.e., mid to upper 70s deg F surface
dewpoints) south of a front.  Scattered thunderstorms should develop
along this boundary by early afternoon then propagate toward and off
the coast by early evening.  Marginally severe gusts could be noted
with the strongest storms.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
INTERMOUNTAIN WEST INTO THE HIGH PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms, capable of localized severe gusts and
perhaps hail, remain possible this evening over parts of the
Intermountain West and into the High Plains.

...01z Update...

Mid-level short-wave trough is advancing east across the northern
intermountain region early this evening. This feature is beginning
to flatten the ridge over western WY and scattered convection has
responded downstream where boundary-layer heating is maximized. 00z
sounding from SLC exhibits near dry adiabatic lapse rate in the
lowest 4km, and modest deep-layer shear; although, PW values are not
particularly high with values around one inch. Latest diagnostic
data suggests pockets of MLCAPE around 500 J/kg extend from southern
MT into eastern CO where considerably more buoyancy exists,
especially across southeast CO into the northern TX Panhandle.
Several gusts have exceeded 50kt with convection late this afternoon
and this remains the primary concern for the next several hours.
After sunset, boundary-layer cooling should hinder convective gusts
as 0-3km lapse rates weaken.
