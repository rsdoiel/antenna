0354 PM CDT Fri May 02 2025

Areas affected...portions of far eastern Texas...central and
northern Louisiana...and central Mississippi

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 211...

Valid 022054Z - 022230Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 211
continues.

SUMMARY...The severe threat continues across Severe Thunderstorm
Watch 211. Large hail and damaging gusts remain possible with the
stronger storms.

DISCUSSION...Multicellular convection persists amid a moderately
unstable but weakly sheared airmass across portions of far eastern
TX into central MS. Ahead of the storms, surface temperatures remain
in the upper 70s to mid 80s F amid upper 60s F dewpoints, with
MLCAPE exceeding 2500 J/kg in spots. Multicellular clusters that
continue to progress eastward into this more buoyant air will
continue to pose a threat for at least marginally severe hail and
strong wind gusts.

Mesoscale Discussion 0656
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0344 PM CDT Fri May 02 2025

Areas affected...portions of southern...central...and eastern Texas

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 212...215...

Valid 022044Z - 022215Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 212, 215
continues.

SUMMARY...The severe threat continues across Severe Thunderstorm
Watches 212 and 215. Large hail is the main threat, though damaging
gusts and a tornado remain possible.

DISCUSSION...Multiple rounds of strong to severe thunderstorms are
underway, and are expected to persist through the remainder of the
afternoon across southern into central and eastern TX. Ahead of the
cold front, quasi-linear multicellular convection persists across
central TX, where marginal severe hail has been reported. Surface
temperatures ahead of these storms are in the 80s F, with low 70s F
dewpoints, supporting 1500-2000 J/kg MLCAPE and a continued marginal
severe hail threat. 

To the south of the central TX storms, supercells continue to
fluctuate in strength along a baroclinic boundary. These storms have
produced occasional instances of marginal severe hail and brief
bouts of low-level rotation. Given ample buoyancy with these storms,
periodic occurrences of large hail and low-level rotation should
continue through the afternoon. Once storms to the north encounter
the ongoing supercells, a few severe gusts could occur given cold
pool mergers. 

Perhaps the greatest threat for severe storms may materialize east
of the Big Bend, over the Edwards Plateau. Here, undisturbed
insolation has persisted the longest, resulting in over 4000 J/kg
MLCAPE amid 45 kts of effective bulk shear. Supercells that develop
in this environment could pose the greatest risk for 2+ inch
diameter hail and perhaps a tornado, as also suggested by some of
the latest Warn-on-Forecast output.

0322 PM CDT Fri May 02 2025

Areas affected...eastern KY/TN and far southwest OH

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 213...

Valid 022022Z - 022215Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 213
continues.

SUMMARY...A mixed threat of isolated severe hail and damaging gusts
should persist through early evening with scattered to broken
thunderstorms from the central Ohio Valley to the Cumberland
Plateau.

DISCUSSION...A fairly messy convective evolution persists, which has
likely mitigated a more widespread damaging wind threat so far this
afternoon. The northern end of the convective swath across KY has
broken up into more cellular elements, with the far northern portion
that moved through the Louisville area producing damaging winds.
Meanwhile farther south in TN, the convective line has failed to
appreciably organize. This may be related to the weak lower-level
flow sampled in area VWP data. Primary severe threat may remain from
sporadic, marginally severe hail. Any one of these stronger cores
might aid in localized damaging wind swaths downstream, but
confidence is low in if/where a more concentrated threat will occur.

0303 PM CDT Fri May 02 2025

Areas affected...north AL...far northwest GA...far southeast TN

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 209...213...214...

Valid 022003Z - 022200Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 209, 213,
214 continues.

SUMMARY...A mix of marginal severe hail and strong to isolated
severe gusts is expected to persist across mainly northern Alabama
through early evening.

DISCUSSION...Yet another line segment has consolidated, this time
along the MS/AL border area, generally on the southern periphery of
the scattered convective swaths over the Deep South and TN Valley.
With low to mid 80s surface temperatures ahead of this line at peak
mixing of the boundary layer, potential for strong to severe gusts
(55-70 mph) should mainly spread across north AL through early
evening. Recent surface observations from KHSV and KCBM have
measured 48 kt gusts. Small to marginally severe hail cores will
remain embedded within the line and in additional cells that can
redevelop atop the large-scale convective outflows, across far north
AL and north GA. Areas farther north-northwest in middle TN appear
to be well stabilized.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 211
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1210 PM CDT Fri May 2 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Southeast Arkansas
  Central and Northern Louisiana
  Central Mississippi
  East Texas

* Effective this Friday afternoon and evening from 1210 PM until
  700 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph likely
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2
    inches in diameter possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms will continue to intensify along an axis
from western Louisiana into central Mississippi through the
afternoon.  A moist and very unstable air mass will promote the risk
of severe storms capable of damaging wind gusts and large hail.  An
isolated tornado cannot be ruled out.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 60

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0250 PM CDT Fri May 02 2025

Valid 022000Z - 031200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM CENTRAL
TX...THE LOWER MS VALLEY TN VALLEY AND LOWER OH VALLEY...

...SUMMARY...
Widespread strong/severe thunderstorms will continue across parts of
central and eastern Texas to the lower Mississippi and Tennessee
Valleys, and into the Cumberland Plateau this afternoon and evening.
This includes potential for large hail and damaging wind gusts.

...20z Update...
The prior outlook remains largely unchanged. Numerous strong
thunderstorms and severe potential continues across the eastern half
of the CONUS. Storm coverage has gradually increased, and should
continue to do so this afternoon/evening along a broad frontal zone
from TX to OH. Damaging winds and hail are likely.

...Rio Grand Valley to LA...
South of the slow moving convectively modified front, robust heating
amid 70's F surface dewpoints will favor additional storm
development this afternoon/evening from southern TX to LA. Low-level
winds will be rather weak, but sufficient deep-layer shear will
promote supercells amid very large SBCAPE (4000-5000 J/kg) and weak
inhibition. Given the expected storm mode, very large hail appears
probable with initial storms across southern TX. The damaging wind
threat should increase through this evening as the front continues
south and upscale growth promotes a more linear mode as storms
spread eastward into the lower MS Valley tonight.

...GA into the western Carolinas...
A cluster of predominately multicell storms has emerged and
persisted across the southern Appalachians this afternoon. Moderate
buoyancy amid weak vertical shear appears likely to support a
continued risk for intermittent strong updrafts. Hail probabilities
have been increased ahead of this cluster as additional storms are
likely over the next several hours. As clustering continues, some
damaging wind threat may also evolve as individual cold pools
gradually coalesce.

...TN Valley...
The severe risk continues across the Mid South and TN Valley ahead
of several loosely organized convective bands and cells. Moderate
CAPE (2000+ J/kg) and 25-35 kt of shear will promote occasional
storm organization with a risk for hail, and eventually damaging
gusts as amalgamation into loosely organized clusters occurs this
evening.

..Lyons.. 05/02/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1110 AM CDT Fri May 02 2025/

...TN/OH Valleys...
Multiple clusters of thunderstorms are affecting parts of
AR/northern MS/west TN late this morning.  These storms will
progress northeastward into a very moist and unstable air mass,
where strong heating and dewpoints near 70F will yield afternoon
MLCAPE values of 2000+ J/kg.  Moderately strong westerly flow aloft
will aid in convective organization, posing a risk of multicell
storms and bowing line segments capable of large hail and damaging
wind gusts.  Southerly low-level wind are strong enough to pose a
risk of a tornado or two, if one or more of the clusters can become
better organized.  Reference WW 209.

...OH/PA...
Thunderstorms are beginning to develop across western OH along a
weak cold front.  This activity will increase in coverage through
the afternoon, spreading northeastward across OH and into northwest
PA.  The strongest cells will be capable of damaging wind gusts and
hail.  Reference MCD #645.

...TX/LA...
A convectively aided front is sagging southward across north TX this
morning.  The air mass along and ahead of the boundary is very moist
and unstable, with forecast soundings showing steep mid-level lapse
rates and at least pockets of very large CAPE (4000-5000 J/kg). 
Weak inhibition will lead to scattered thunderstorm development
along the boundary by mid-afternoon.  Low-level winds will be rather
weak, but sufficient deep-layer shear will promote supercells
capable of very large hail and damaging wind.  Very strong
anvil-level winds will aid in the large/giant hail potential. 
Reference MCD #646.

Valid 031200Z - 041200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

Dry thunderstorm chances were removed from the D2 Fire Weather
Outlook with this update. Portions of central New Mexico into
eastern Arizona will likely receive wetting rainfall on D1.
Precipitable water values will remain near or just under 0.50" for
D2, with slow storm motions forecast to continue. Additional wetting
rainfall will be possible in this regime as scattered thunderstorms
are expected.

..Thornton.. 05/02/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0140 AM CDT Fri May 02 2025/

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns will continue to be focused across the
Southwest as isolated to scattered thunderstorms develop through
late Saturday afternoon. Upper ridging is expected to spread across
the High Plains through the day as an upper wave begins to approach
the West Coast. Southerly low/mid-level flow ahead of the upper wave
will help maintain a modestly moist air mass (characterized by 0.4
to 0.6 inch PWAT values) across the Southwest into the Great Basin.
Increasing broad scale ascent, coupled with antecedent steep
mid-level lapse rates, will promote isolated thunderstorms from
central NM to central NV by late afternoon. Limited moisture
throughout the column combined with deep boundary layers will act to
limit precipitation amounts and support dry lightning strikes. While
this potential is noted across a broad swath of the region, the fire
weather threat will be greatest across eastern AZ into NM where fuel
conditions are currently the driest per recent fuel and drought
guidance.

Valid 041200Z - 051200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM THE FLORIDA
EAST COAST INTO SOUTHERN PENNSYLVANIA...AND ACROSS EASTERN NEW
MEXICO...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated strong to severe thunderstorms are possible along the
Florida east coast into the North Carolina/Virginia Piedmont and
southern Pennsylvania. Additional severe thunderstorms are possible
across eastern New Mexico.

...Coastal GA to southern PA...

A mid/upper cyclone will remain centered over the OH/TN Valley
vicinity on Sunday. This will maintain a belt of enhanced mid/upper
flow across portions of the Southeast and central
Appalachians/Mid-Atlantic vicinity. Meanwhile, at the surface a cold
front will stall from roughly northern VA into southeast GA and the
FL Panhandle. Ahead of the surface boundary, 60s F dewpoints will be
in place as far north as the Delmarva. Morning showers and clouds
across the region may limit stronger heating and destabilization,
but continued moist advection beneath modest midlevel lapse rates
will support corridors of MLCAPE around 500-750 J/kg. Vertical shear
will remain modest, around 25 kt effective shear magnitudes, but
sufficient for at least transient organized updrafts. Stronger cells
may produce locally damaging gusts or marginal hail. 

...FL...

While large-scale ascent will remain nebulous across the region, low
to mid-60s F dewpoints and strong heating will support weak to
moderate diurnal destabilization. Forecast guidance suggests a
well-defined sea breeze will develop along the FL east coast.
Low-level convergence along this boundary within the moderately
unstable airmass should support isolated to scattered
cellular/multicell convection during the afternoon. While vertical
shear will remain modest (around 25 kt effective shear), vertically
veering profiles and steep low-level lapse rates suggest locally
strong gusts and perhaps a tornado could occur along the sea breeze
boundary.

...Eastern NM...

An upper cyclone will develop eastward across the Southwest on
Sunday. A belt of enhanced mid/upper southerly flow will overspread
the southern Rockies/adjacent High Plains during the
afternoon/evening. Near the surface, southeasterly upslope flow is
forecast. While boundary moisture will remain meager (dewpoints
generally in the 40s F), cool temperatures aloft (around -15 C at
500 mb) will result in steep midlevel lapse rates, supporting weak
instability. Isolated to scattered thunderstorms are expected to
develop along the central mountains of NM and spread into the
adjacent High Plains with time from late afternoon into the evening
hours. Isolated large hail and strong gusts will be possible with
these storms.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM PORTIONS OF
THE CAROLINAS INTO SOUTHEAST PENNSYLVANIA...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated strong to severe storms are possible on Saturday from the
Southeast to southern New England and across deep South Texas.

...Synopsis...

A positive-tilt mid/upper trough from the Great Lakes to East Texas
will shift east over the MS Valley as an upper cyclone develops over
IL/MO by early afternoon. The upper cyclone should progress eastward
over the Lower OH/TN Valley vicinity by the end of the period. Ahead
of this system, a broad swath of modest southwesterly flow aloft
will overspread much of the Eastern Seaboard. At the surface, weak
cyclogenesis is forecast over the Ohio Valley. Meanwhile, a cold
front will move across the Northeast, the central Appalachians, and
much of the Southeast through Sunday morning. 

Further west, an upper trough will develop inland across the West. A
belt of enhanced southerly mid/upper flow is expected to overspread
portions of the Great Basin and the northern Rockies as this occurs.
At the surface, a cold front will move eastward across the northern
Great Basin.

...Southeast to Northeast U.S....

Southerly low-level flow will transport modest boundary layer
moisture northward ahead of the aforementioned cold front and
surface low. Dewpoints will generally range from the upper 60s to
low 60s F, though a corridor of mid-60s F dewpoints may occur from
the Southeast into the central Appalachians. Convection will likely
be ongoing across portions of MS/AL into the Lower OH Valley
Saturday morning. Some of this activity across the Southeast could
pose a risk for strong gusts. Additional convection is expected to
develop during the afternoon ahead of the advancing cold front
within a modestly destabilizing airmass (MLCAPE to around 1000
J/kg). Overall, vertical shear profiles are forecast to remain
modest, with less than 25-30 kt effective shear magnitudes. However,
closer to the surface low and within a zone of potentially stronger
differential heating from the central Appalachians to southeast PA,
25-35 kt effective shear may support better organized/stronger
updrafts. Isolated severe gusts and hail to 1.5 inches could occur
with these cells within an area of steepened low-level lapse rates
and moderate shear. An upgrade to Slight (level 2 of 5) has been
included with this outlook update.

The severe risk across the broader region will be tempered by modest
shear/instability, though isolated strong gusts or hail may occur
with any stronger cells. Additionally, with eastward extent into the
Piedmont and Mid-Atlantic coastal areas, inhibition will increase
during the evening as storms move into these areas, further limiting
severe potential.

...NV into OR/ID...

Scattered thunderstorms are expected during the afternoon amid
increasing large-scale ascent and steepening mid and low-level lapse
rates. Cool temperatures aloft will support steep midlevel lapse
rates greater than 7-7.5 C/km, fostering up to 500 J/kg MLCAPE.
Midlevel flow around 30-45 kt atop steep low-level lapse rates and a
well-mixed boundary layer suggest some stronger outflow winds will
be possible with the convection and a Marginal (level 1 of 5) risk
has been included.

...South TX...

Strong storms may be ongoing at the beginning of the period as the
southwest extent of the aforementioned cold front overlies far South
TX. Strong gusts could occur with this activity for a few hours in
the morning before the boundary pushes south.

1201 PM CDT Fri May 02 2025

Valid 021700Z - 031200Z

Adjustments were made to the dry thunderstorm risk across portions
of central New Mexico to reduce the spatial extent across
central/east-central New Mexico. Though moisture is limited, it
appears that storm motions and coverage will be sufficient for
wetting rainfall across this area. HREF guidance suggests a broad
swath of 0.25-0.50" of rain is possible.

..Thornton.. 05/02/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1255 AM CDT Fri May 02 2025/

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns are expected to remain confined to the
Southwest for today, and will mainly manifest as a dry-thunderstorm
risk across parts of far eastern Arizona into central New Mexico.
Early-morning water vapor imagery shows a weak upper low over the
southern CA coast. This feature is expected to drift east over the
next 24 hours, reaching AZ/NM by peak heating this afternoon. Steep
mid-level lapse rates and modest mid-level moisture were sampled by
the FGZ and ABQ 00z soundings, which should be adequate for weak
convection this afternoon as ascent overspreads the region. Deep,
well-mixed boundary layers between 2-3 km deep, coupled with PWAT
values of 0.6 inches or less, should promote relatively dry
thunderstorms from central AZ to central NM. Latest fuel and drought
guidance shows sufficiently dry conditions across eastern AZ into NM
to support fire ignitions from dry lightning strikes. South of the
dry thunderstorm risk area, 10-15 mph southerly winds coupled with
RH values in the teens will promote pockets of elevated fire weather
conditions.

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM
CENTRAL/EAST TEXAS TO THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AND TENNESSEE
VALLEY...

...SUMMARY...
Widespread strong/severe thunderstorm development is expected from
parts of central and eastern Texas to the lower Mississippi and
Tennessee Valleys, and into the Cumberland Plateau by evening. This
includes potential for large hail and damaging wind gusts.

...TN/OH Valleys...
Multiple clusters of thunderstorms are affecting parts of
AR/northern MS/west TN late this morning.  These storms will
progress northeastward into a very moist and unstable air mass,
where strong heating and dewpoints near 70F will yield afternoon
MLCAPE values of 2000+ J/kg.  Moderately strong westerly flow aloft
will aid in convective organization, posing a risk of multicell
storms and bowing line segments capable of large hail and damaging
wind gusts.  Southerly low-level wind are strong enough to pose a
risk of a tornado or two, if one or more of the clusters can become
better organized.  Reference WW 209.

...OH/PA...
Thunderstorms are beginning to develop across western OH along a
weak cold front.  This activity will increase in coverage through
the afternoon, spreading northeastward across OH and into northwest
PA.  The strongest cells will be capable of damaging wind gusts and
hail.  Reference MCD #645.

...TX/LA...
A convectively aided front is sagging southward across north TX this
morning.  The air mass along and ahead of the boundary is very moist
and unstable, with forecast soundings showing steep mid-level lapse
rates and at least pockets of very large CAPE (4000-5000 J/kg). 
Weak inhibition will lead to scattered thunderstorm development
along the boundary by mid-afternoon.  Low-level winds will be rather
weak, but sufficient deep-layer shear will promote supercells
capable of very large hail and damaging wind.  Very strong
anvil-level winds will aid in the large/giant hail potential. 
Reference MCD #646.

Valid 051200Z - 101200Z

...DISCUSSION...
...Day 4/Monday - Southern High Plains...
Lee cyclogenesis will strengthen on Monday in the southern High
Plains as a mid-level trough advects eastward. As this occurs, rich
low-level moisture will advect into West Texas which will result in
strong instability as temperatures continue to cool aloft. Expect
scattered thunderstorm development along the dryline during the
afternoon/evening. However, more widespread storm development is
likely after 00Z as the low-level jet strengthens across West Texas.
Initial supercells will have a threat for all severe weather hazards
before eventual upscale growth into a MCS likely results in a
greater severe wind threat. 

...Day 5/Tuesday - Central/East Texas into Louisiana...
Day 4 thunderstorms will likely be ongoing at the beginning of the
period along a frontal zone across central/East Texas and persist
eastward through the day. Destabilization remains questionable as
strong high pressure and the low-latitude nature of the mid-level
trough may limit northward movement of the warm front. The potential
for this front to be stationary, in addition to widespread
convection/cloud cover concerns along the front, preclude severe
weather probabilities at this time. However, there will likely be a
corridor along the frontal zone with some greater severe weather
threat which may become more clear as the event draws closer.

Additional severe storms will be possible Day 6 and 7 along the
frontal zone/composite outflow in Texas, but the location of this
feature and degree of destabilization along it will be highly
dependent on prior days convective activity. For these reasons, no
probabilities have been added at this time.

Mesoscale Discussion 0634
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0322 PM CDT Thu May 01 2025

Areas affected...western MD/eastern WV Panhandles into south-central
PA

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 012022Z - 012145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...A single, slow-moving supercell may persist for the next
couple hours with a threat of large hail and localized damaging
winds. Confidence is low in greater coverage/longevity for a
potential severe thunderstorm watch.

DISCUSSION...A supercell centered on Allegany County, MD has had the
most impressive observational structure per radar/satellite trends,
relative to other severe storms in the Upper OH Valley/Lower Great
Lakes region. This cell appears to be anchored near a slow-moving
warm front, likely ingesting a mesoscale ribbon of mid 60s surface
dew points southeastward along the WV/VA/MD border area. Given the
relatively confined region of this enhancement, with a substantially
drier air mass both to the northeast and south, the longevity of a
sustained supercell structure is questionable. However, it is
plausible that a localized severe hail/wind threat may continue for
the next couple hours.

Mesoscale Discussion 0623
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0307 PM CDT Wed Apr 30 2025

Areas affected...Eastern Kentucky

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 302007Z - 302200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated damaging winds and potentially marginally severe
hail may occur with the strongest storms. A watch is not likely this
afternoon.

DISCUSSION...A very moist airmass (mid/upper 60s F dewpoints) is in
place in the Upper Ohio Valley vicinity. On the southern fringe of a
belt of stronger mid-level flow, effective shear is a modest 25-30
kts. Around 1500 J/kg MLCAPE will promote a few stronger to
marginally severe storms. Low-level lapse rates are steep and
damaging winds are the primary threat. Mid-level lapse rates
(sampled by this mornings soundings) are modest. Small to perhaps
isolated, marginally severe hail may occur with the strongest
storms.

Mesoscale Discussion 0622
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0253 PM CDT Wed Apr 30 2025

Areas affected...western and central Arkansas

Concerning...Tornado Watch 197...

Valid 301953Z - 302200Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 197 continues.

SUMMARY...A line of strong to severe storms will continue eastward
the next several hours. Damaging gusts and a tornado or two remain
possible. A downstream watch will likely be needed.

DISCUSSION...The line of convection across western AR will continue
to shift east at around 35 kt the next few hours. downstream,
filtered heating has allowed temperatures to warm into the low/mid
80s amid low/mid 60s F dewpoints. Midlevel lapse rates remain
modest, but the moist environment is fostering modest instability
amid a moderately sheared environment. Given stronger heating ahead
of the line, low-level lapse rates have steepened considerable, and
this may foster a continued risk for damaging gusts into early
evening. A new watch downstream from Tornado Watch 197 will likely
be needed in the next hour.

Mesoscale Discussion 0621
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0240 PM CDT Wed Apr 30 2025

Areas affected...East-central Missouri into southern Illinois

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 301940Z - 302145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...A few storms are possible along an outflow boundary. All
severe hazards would be possible. A watch is uncertain in the short
term, but issuance is possible this afternoon depending on
observational trends.

DISCUSSION...Airmass modification after earlier convection has been
evident over the past couple of hours in central Missouri and
southern Illinois. The primary outflow boundary is situated just
south of St. Louis and extends into far southern Illinois and
southern Indiana. Dewpoints south of the boundary have increased to
upper 60s F except for parts of southeastern Missouri which has only
recovered into the low 60s F. North of the outflow boundary, stable
billow clouds remain. However, very near the boundary temperatures
and dewpoints have increased and at least some MLCIN has been
removed and convection has begun to slowly deepen.

With 40 kts of effective shear (more favorably oriented across the
boundary on its western half), supercells would be expected if
storms develop. Large hail and damaging winds would be possible. A
tornado or two would also be possible for storms interacting with
the more backed easterly/southeasterly winds on the cooler side of
the boundary. Being in the wake of an earlier MCV, forcing for
ascent will be nebulous and will depend on heating/destabilization
along the outflow. Trends will continue to be monitored. A watch is
possible this afternoon.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0736 AM CDT Wed Apr 30 2025

Valid 301300Z - 011200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM NORTHEAST
TX INTO SOUTHWEST OK AND THE ARKLATEX...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM WEST-CENTRAL
MO ACROSS SOUTHERN IL INTO SOUTHERN IN...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are possible on later today into this
evening from the southern Plains into the Lower Ohio Valley, with
the greatest risk expected across north-central Texas into the
ArkLaTex region. Large to very large hail, damaging winds, and
tornadoes are all possible, with some strong-tornado potential.

...Synopsis...
Early morning satellite imagery shows a mature convective complex
over western OK and northwest TX, another decaying convective
complex over southern MO, and a shortwave trough moving across the
Southwest. Recent surface analysis shows a mesolow associated with
western OK/northwest TX MCS over the SPS vicinity, with another,
more substantial low back southwest near SNK. An outflow boundary
from prior convection extends from south-central OK through
southeastern OK before becoming more diffuse and merging with the
stationary front over central AR.

The ongoing MCS is forecast to continue eastward/northeastward
throughout the day while the Southwest shortwave progresses into the
southern High Plains. Farther east, the stationary front that
extends from AR into the Mid-Atlantic is expected to begin
translating back northward as a warm front. 

...North TX/Southern OK into the Arklatex and Mid-South...
The well-organized MCS currently tracking across southwest OK and
northwest TX is forecast to continue east-northeastward throughout
much of the period. The northern portion of this system will likely
remain progressive, moving through southern OK and north TX.
Damaging gusts and occasional hail will be possible with this system
throughout much of its lifecycle. Buoyancy decreases with eastern
extent, so the system should begin to lose intensity, but its
organized character limits the predictability of where that will
occur. Not only that, but downstream destabilization could lead to
potential reintensification/redevelopment along the outflow during
the late afternoon. Vertical shear will be modest, suggesting
reorganization into a severe convective line appears unlikely. 

The southwestern portion of this MCS is expected to trail behind the
more forward-progression portion as it becomes more parallel to the
deep-layer shear vector. This orientation would likely keep deep
convection out of central/northeast TX before this afternoon. Storm
development appears probable across central TX as the surface low
and associated dryline shifts eastward ahead of the Southwest
shortwave trough. Development is possible ahead of this dryline
within the destabilized warm sector over northeast TX as well. Lapse
rates will be modest, but ample low-level moisture will still result
in moderate to strong buoyancy during the afternoon. Additionally, a
belt of stronger low-level flow is anticipated to persist,
supporting strong low-level shear and veering low-level hodographs.
The conditions support the potential for supercells capable of all
severe hazards, including tornadoes.

Eventual storm clustering could lead to development of a nocturnal
MCS that could eventually approach parts of the lower MS Valley,
with at least an isolated severe threat.  

...West TX into Northwest TX/Southwest OK...
Additional strong to severe storms will be possible across parts of
west TX, in closer proximity to shortwave trough moving across the
southern High Plains. Cold temperatures aloft and steep lapse rates
will support a threat of hail and localized severe gusts, even
though deep-layer flow/shear will be more modest within this regime.
These storms may eventually spread toward southwest OK/northwest TX
before weakening. 

...Parts of MS/OH Valleys...
Afternoon thunderstorm development is anticipated amid modest
low-level moisture advection in the wake of the convective cluster
currently moving through southwest MO. Modest buoyancy and shear
across the region suggest there is some potential for at least
transient storm organization in the vicinity of the frontal zone,
with an attendant threat for hail, locally damaging wind, and
possibly a tornado.

...Southern VA/northern NC...
Scattered storm development will be possible near the front across
parts of VA/NC. Deep-layer flow/shear will generally be weak, but
steep low-level lapse rates could support locally damaging outflow
winds with the strongest storms.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 196
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1255 AM CDT Wed Apr 30 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Southwest and South-Central Oklahoma
  Northwest and North-Central Texas

* Effective this Wednesday morning from 1255 AM until 800 AM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2
    inches in diameter likely
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph likely
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Strong to severe thunderstorms are expected to persist
throughout the night in the vicinity of an outflow boundary that
extends across the region. Hail will be the primary risk with this
more cellular development. There is also some potential for the
storms in west TX to evolve into an organized line segment that
could progress across the region later. Damaging gusts would be the
primary risk with this more linear activity.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 50
statute miles north and south of a line from 50 miles south
southwest of Altus OK to 30 miles south southeast of Mcalester OK.
For a complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch
outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU6).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 194...WW 195...

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
24035.

Areas affected...Portions of South Plains into western North Texas

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 190...

Valid 292055Z - 292230Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 190
continues.

SUMMARY...A localized corridor of tornado potential may develop over
the next few hours. Storms will need to root along/east of the
surface boundary for this potential to be realized.

DISCUSSION...A cluster of supercells, some of which have produced
greater than 2 inch hail, are generally rooted just on the cool side
of the surface cold front. If storms can remain discrete and track
with a more eastward motion, warm/moist easterly surface winds are
in the warm sector. Greater tornado potential would exist should
that scenario occur. Given at least a modest increase in low-level
flow this evening, it is possible the boundary moves slightly
northwestward. Trends will be monitored.

Mesoscale Discussion 0607
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0335 PM CDT Tue Apr 29 2025

Areas affected...Parts of eastern Oklahoma into Northwest Arkansas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 292035Z - 292230Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Storms that are currently elevated may produce marginally
severe hail. A watch is not anticipated in the short term, but
trends will be monitored.

DISCUSSION...Storms in central Oklahoma have remained elevated and
sub-severe so far. The observed 18Z Norman sounding showed modestly
steep mid-level lapse rates, but relatively weak buoyancy due to
cloud cover/precipitation. This activity will generally move to the
east/northeast behind an outflow boundary. Recent surface
observations have shown some airmass modification/recovery in
east-central Oklahoma where temperatures have warmed back into the
low 70s. There is at least low potential that storms nearest to the
outflow boundary could become near to surface based. A locally
greater severe threat would be possible in that scenario. Overall,
however, storms will primarily be capable of marginally severe hail
and perhaps isolated damaging gusts.

Mesoscale Discussion 0606
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0327 PM CDT Tue Apr 29 2025

Areas affected...southern IL/IN into southwest OH.

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 188...189...

Valid 292027Z - 292230Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 188, 189
continues.

SUMMARY...Strong to severe thunderstorms producing damaging wind
gusts will move from southern Illinois into southern Indiana the
next 1-2 hours. Additional severe risk may redevelop into southwest
Ohio this evening.

DISCUSSION...A mature MCS continues to move from southern IL into
southern IN this afternoon. This activity has sporadically produced
damaging gusts and isolated hail over the last couple of hours, with
a couple areas of line-embedded rotation also noted. These storms
should maintain intensity as it moves east across a moderately
unstable airmass with steepening low-level lapse rates continuing to
support damaging wind potential across Severe Thunderstorm Watch
189. 

By evening, this MCS is expected to approach southwest OH and Severe
Thunderstorm Watch 188. The airmass across this area has shown signs
of recovery from a midday cluster of severe storms now approaching
western PA. Temperatures have rebounded into the mid/upper 70s with
dewpoints in the mid/upper 60s. This area could support a continued
severe risk into this evening. As such, watch clearance has not been
recommended as redevelopment of new convection is possible.
Likewise, the cluster moving into southern IN also may approach this
area in the next 2-3 hours.

Mesoscale Discussion 0599
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0552 AM CDT Tue Apr 29 2025

Areas affected...central into northeast Oklahoma...far southeast
Kansas

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 186...

Valid 291052Z - 291345Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 186
continues.

SUMMARY...Locally severe gusts remain possible from central into
northeast Oklahoma.

DISCUSSION...The leading edge of a small MCS which moved out of
northwest TX and pivoted into southwest OK continues to produce
measured severe gusts, most recently in Grady County as of 1030Z.
North of this area, storms have gradually increased along the cold
front extending from southeast KS into north-central OK. This line
of storms is also beginning to produce outflow as well.

An unstable air mass remains ahead of both convective systems, and
it appears these storms will merge from central into northeast OK.
Damaging gusts will remain the most likely threat, although hail of
1.00+" is likely in the stronger storm cores.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 186
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
235 AM CDT Tue Apr 29 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Far Northwest Arkansas
  South-Central/Southeast Kansas
  Far Southwest Missouri
  Northern Oklahoma
  Far Northeast Texas Panhandle

* Effective this Tuesday morning from 235 AM until 1000 AM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2
    inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms are expected to develop across northwest OK
and the far northeast TX Panhandle in the vicinity of a cold front
progressing southward. This initial activity could pose a threat for
large hail. This development will likely grow upscale with an
attendant threat for damaging gusts as it moves eastward across
northern OK and south-central/southeast KS into far southwest MO and
far northwest AR. Some hail is possible within the stronger cells
across these areas as well.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 60
statute miles north and south of a line from 95 miles west southwest
of Alva OK to 20 miles east northeast of Joplin MO. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU6).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
24035.

PUBLIC SEVERE WEATHER OUTLOOK  
NWS STORM PREDICTION CENTER NORMAN OK
0852 PM CDT MON APR 28 2025

...Severe thunderstorms expected over parts of the Upper Midwest
this evening and overnight...

* LOCATIONS...
  Wisconsin
  Northern Iowa
  Far Southeast Minnesota

* HAZARDS...
  Several tornadoes, a few intense
  Scattered large hail, some baseball size
  Scattered damaging winds

* SUMMARY...
  Multiple corridors of severe thunderstorms will continue this
  evening from the Upper Midwest into the central and southern
  Plains. Tornadoes, large hail, and severe gusts all remain
  possible, including some potential for strong tornadoes.

Preparedness actions...

Tornadoes at night can be particularly dangerous because they 
are usually fast-moving and difficult to see. Stay tuned to
NOAA Weather Radio, weather.gov, or other media for watches and
warnings. A tornado watch means that conditions are favorable
for tornadoes to form during the next several hours. If a tornado
warning is issued for your area, move to a place of safety,
ideally in a basement or interior room on the lowest floor of a
sturdy building.

Mesoscale Discussion 0588
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0333 PM CDT Mon Apr 28 2025

Areas affected...Edwards Plateau into western/central Oklahoma

Concerning...Severe potential...Tornado Watch likely 

Valid 282033Z - 282300Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...A tornado watch will likely be needed this afternoon as
storms are expected to develop along the dryline in the next 2-3
hours. All severe hazards will be possible. The tornado threat will
steadily increase from late afternoon into the evening.

DISCUSSION...Signs of mid-level ascent have been evident across the
southern Plains with visible satellite showing increasing amounts of
mid/high-level clouds moving in from the southwest. As a shortwave
perturbation lifts northeastward this afternoon/evening, this ascent
and additional surface heating should erode capping along/near the
dryline. A high-based storm has already formed northeast of Fort
Stockton in the last hour. Additional storms are expected to develop
later this afternoon, perhaps within the next 2-3 hours.

The environment will be quite favorable for supercells capable of
all severe hazards. Very steep mid-level lapse rates were observed
within the High Plains region on this mornings soundings. Large to
potentially giant hail will be possible along with severe winds.
Tornadoes will also be possible, particularly from southwest
Oklahoma into the Texas Rolling Plains where dewpoints have remained
in the upper 60s/low 70s F. The tornado threat will steadily
increase with time as 850 mb winds increase east of the dryline from
late afternoon into the evening. A strong tornado cannot be ruled
out within this more favorable mesoscale zone.

Mesoscale Discussion 0587
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0328 PM CDT Mon Apr 28 2025

Areas affected...far southeast NE...southwest into central
IA...northwest MO...northeast KS

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 282028Z - 282300Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...Widely scattered thunderstorms will pose a risk for a few
tornadoes (a couple strong), large to very large hail (up to 3 inch
diameter), and isolated damaging gusts through evening. A tornado
watch will likely be needed for portions of the discussion area from
central Iowa into northeast Kansas.

DISCUSSION...Deepening cumulus is noted along a dryline from eastern
NE/northwest IA southward into northeast KS. An 18z RAOB from OAX
indicated an EML around 700 mb, but only weak capping remained.
Additional heating into the low/mid 80s F amid mid/upper 60s F
dewpoints beneath steep midlevel lapse rates around 7.5-8.5 C/km 
immediately downstream from the surface dryline is support strong
instability with MLCAPE greater than 2000 J/kg noted in latest SPC
Mesoanalysis and the 18z OAX RAOB. In addition to this this
favorable thermodynamic environment, vertical shear is very
favorable for supercell thunderstorms, as evident in enlarged,
looping low-level hodographs becoming somewhat elongated above 2-3
km. 

Large-scale ascent will remain somewhat weaker with southward extent
into the MO Valley vicinity, and storm coverage is a bit uncertain,
especially with southward extent. Timing of convective initiation is
also uncertain, but seems most likely in the 22-00z time frame.
Regardless, any storms developing in this environment will likely
have robust updrafts and become intense, posing a risk for very
large hail, a few tornadoes and damaging gusts. A tornado watch will
likely be needed for portions of the MCD area in the next 1-2 hours.

Mesoscale Discussion 0586
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0225 PM CDT Mon Apr 28 2025

Areas affected...central/southeast MN...western WI...northern IA

Concerning...Severe potential...Tornado Watch likely 

Valid 281925Z - 282130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...Severe thunderstorm potential will increase through late
afternoon. All severe hazards, including tornadoes (some strong),
very large hail (to 3 inch diameter) and damaging gusts (to 70 mph)
are possible.

DISCUSSION...A line of convection along a surface front across
southwest MN into northwest IA will continue to shift east/northeast
this afternoon. Ahead of this convection, the downstream airmass
across central/southeast MN, northern IA and western WI continues to
moisten and destabilize. Surface dewpoints have increased into the
low to mid 60s as far north as the Minneapolis metro area, with
upper 50s to near 60 F to the north and east. Continued northward
moisture transport on a 50+ kt low level jet should continue to aid
in further destabilization over the next few hours as large-scale
ascent overspreads the region. 

Region VWP data from KMPX/KDMX/KARX already show impressive vertical
shear favorable for supercells. Enlarged, curved low-level
hodographs amid the strengthening low-level jet is aiding in 0-1 km
SRH greater than 250 m2/s2. As weak MLCIN continues to erode,
convection moving into this environment is likely to become better
organized, with an increase in storm coverage expected into northern
IA. Intense convection is expected to move across the MCD from late
this afternoon into this evening, posing an all-hazards severe risk.
A tornado watch will likely be needed in the next 1-2 hours.

Day 3 Convective Outlook CORR 1
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0317 AM CDT Mon Apr 28 2025

Valid 301200Z - 011200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS PORTIONS OF
NORTH-CENTRAL TEXAS INTO SOUTHERN OKLAHOMA...

CORRECTED FOR INCORRECT DAY REFERENCE

...SUMMARY...
Widely scattered thunderstorm activity is expected from the southern
Plains to the Great Lakes on Wednesday as a mid-level trough ejects
into the southern Plains. Severe thunderstorms will be possible
across east-central Texas into central/eastern Oklahoma.

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will eject across the southern Plains on Tuesday.
Surface low development is expected across western Texas on
D2-Tuesday, with a weak low tracking eastward into east-central
Texas by the D3-Wednesday period. Overnight thunderstorm activity is
expected at the beginning of the D3 period across portions of
central Oklahoma into east-central Texas. By the afternoon,
additional scattered thunderstorm development along the dryline near
the Red River on Wednesday afternoon will pose potential for severe
wind, hail, and a tornado.

...East-Central Texas into southern Oklahoma...
Scattered thunderstorm development along the dryline across central
Texas into Oklahoma on Wednesday afternoon will pose some severe
potential. Some uncertainty arises in coverage of morning convection
and cloud cover. However, it appears a corridor of favorable
instability and shear will overlap by the afternoon along and ahead
of the dryline. Shear profiles will be supportive of supercells
before clusters begin to form and attempts at upscale growth occur.
Large hail and damaging wind will be the primary risks given steep
lapse rates, though forecast soundings do show some curvature of low
level hodographs favorable for some tornado risk with early
supercell modes.

Mesoscale Discussion 0577
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0349 PM CDT Sun Apr 27 2025

Areas affected...parts of nw TX into the TX Pnhdl

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 272049Z - 272245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Probabilities for thunderstorm development appear low, but
may not be negligible late this afternoon into early evening, with
the environment conditionally supportive of supercells posing a risk
for large hail and tornadoes.  If and when it becomes more certain
that storms will form, a severe weather watch will probably be
needed.

DISCUSSION...Boundary-layer moisture characterized by lower/mid 60s
surface dew points is being maintained across the Lubbock through
Amarillo vicinities, beneath a deep warm elevated mixed-layer based
between 850-700 mb, just east of a dryline which may mix only slowly
northeastward/eastward into early evening.  This appears to be
contributing to strong potential instability (3000+ J/kg), beneath
moderate to strong southwesterly mid/upper flow (including 40-70+ kt
in the 500-300 mb layer), and an environment conditionally
supportive of intense supercells.

Perhaps due to the warm/dry air at mid-levels, and weak large-scale
forcing for ascent, convection allowing guidance, in particular,
continues to indicate generally low potential for thunderstorm
initiation through early evening.  However, at least attempts at
deepening convective development are evident to the west of the
dryline, and objective analysis indicates a possible secondary
maximum in dryline convergence developing near/north of Lubbock
toward areas west of Amarillo.   

Of particular concern, if a sustained storm does develop during the
next couple of hours, there appears potential for rapid
intensification while propagating across the dryline.  Toward
23-00Z, strengthening south-southeasterly low-level flow (in excess
of 30 kt around 850 mb) may contribute to enlarging clockwise curved
low-level hodographs increasingly supportive of potential for
tornadoes, in addition to large, potentially damaging hail.

Mesoscale Discussion 0576
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0347 PM CDT Sun Apr 27 2025

Areas affected...Western Kansas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 272047Z - 272245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Watch issuance in western Kansas is currently unlikely.
Significant severe would be possible if storms develop.
Observational trends will be monitored.

DISCUSSION...Periodic enhancement to the cumulus field in western
Kansas has been noted in day cloud phase satellite imagery,
primarily in the vicinity of Goodland. Low 60s F dewpoints ahead of
the surface trough/modest dryline has allowed around 2500 J/kg
MLCAPE to develop. With the generally weak dryline circulation and
uncertain/subtle mid-level ascent, the development of deep
convection is far from a given. Only the more aggressive of the CAM
models suggests development later this afternoon. However, despite
this uncertainty, the environment will be conditionally favorable
for significant severe if storms can form. Supercells would be
likely given 40-45 kts of effective shear perpendicular to the
dryline. Furthermore, a strong increase in 850 mb winds after 00Z
would support a tornado threat.

Watch issuance appears unlikely at this time, but observational
trends (including observed sounding data) will be monitored over the
next few hours.

Mesoscale Discussion 0575
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0329 PM CDT Sun Apr 27 2025

Areas affected...2Nebraska Panhandle into the Sandhills and
Southwest Nebraska

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 272029Z - 272230Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated to widely scattered supercell potential should
increase over the next 2-3 hours. Large/very-large hail and severe
gusts will be possible. The tornado threat will initially be low,
but will increase for storms persisting near/after sunset. Trends
will be monitored for watch issuance.

DISCUSSION...As the lee trough continues to deepen this afternoon,
clusters of cumulus clouds have begun to develop in northeast
Colorado. With time and the approach of a shortwave trough, a
surface low will become more evident in eastern Colorado. Low 60s F
dewpoints have already reached parts of northwest Kansas and should
continue north and west as low-level winds respond to the surface
cyclone.

Effective shear of around 45 kts across the trough axis will promote
discrete storm development. Steep mid-level lapse rates and
initially long, straight hodographs will promote a risk for
large/very-large hail and severe winds. As the low-level jet
increases this evening, any mature supercells ongoing will have an
increased potential to produce a tornado. Storm coverage is somewhat
uncertain, but isolated to widely scattered supercells appear
possible given at least modest mid-level ascent expected over the
next few hours.

Mesoscale Discussion 0574
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0255 PM CDT Sun Apr 27 2025

Areas affected...,parts of swrn TX

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 271955Z - 272100Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...The initiation of a couple of storms appears increasingly
likely near and northwest through north of Fort Stockton through 4-5
PM CDT.  More rapid thunderstorm intensification accompanied by
increasing potential for large hail and locally damaging wind gusts
may be initially slow, before probably increasing toward early
evening around the Midland through Big Spring vicinities.

DISCUSSION...The boundary-layer is becoming strongly heated and
deeply mixed across the Davis Mountains vicinity of southwest Texas
into the Texas South Plains.  The dryline is sharpening east through
north of Fort Stockton, where 2-hourly surface pressure falls around
2.0+ mb have been observed the past couple of hours, and low-level
convergence appears strongest.

Deepening convective development is ongoing within the deeper
mixed-boundary layer around Fort Stockton, where surface
temperature/dew point spreads are around 50 F (95/44), but forecast
soundings and HREF guidance suggests that the initiation of at least
isolated thunderstorm development is increasingly probable through
21-22Z.  It appears that this may be aided by forcing associated
with a mid-level speed maximum within southwesterly flow emanating
from the northern Mexican Plateau.

Downstream of slow moving large-scale mid-level troughing over the
southern Great Basin and Southwest, after at least some further
eastward mixing of the dryline late this afternoon, it probably will
begin to retreat northwest across the Pecos Valley vicinity toward
23-00Z.  As this occurs, convection may acquire more substantively
unstable updraft inflow (including most unstable CAPE up to
2000-3000+ J/kg), supporting increasing potential for rapid
thunderstorm intensification, in the presence of strong deep-layer
shear.  This may including a splitting supercell or two, posing a
risk for large hail and a few strong surface gusts.

Until then, though, initial thunderstorm development will probably
be more modest in strength, but could still pose some risk for
producing severe hail and wind.
