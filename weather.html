Mesoscale Discussion 1956
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0552 PM CDT Fri Aug 15 2025

Areas affected...portions of eastern/southeastern Iowa into
northwestern Illinois

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 590...

Valid 152252Z - 160015Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 590
continues.

SUMMARY...A well organized bowing cluster should continue across
southeastern IA into northwestern IL this evening. Damaging gusts
(some 70+ mph) are likely.

DISCUSSION...As of 2245 UTC, regional radar imagery shows a stronger
bowing cluster has emerged from the initial convection of storms
over eastern IA. Downstream, a very unstable environment (4000-5000
J/kg of SBCAPE) remains in place. While vertical shear (25-35 kt) is
expected to decrease with southern extent, evidence of an elevated
rear-inflow jet and a 20-25 deg F cold pool, along with the degree
of buoyancy suggest maintenance of this complex is likely for at
least a few more hours. With several gusts to 70+ mph observed over
the 60 minutes, damaging winds remain likely across
eastern/southeastern IA, into northwestern and possible
north-central IL this evening.

CAM guidance has not handled the convective evolution particularity
well thus far, with only a few outlier solutions capturing the
intensity of the bow. This lends lower confidence to the downstream
severe risk this evening. However, the continued favorable
environment and well-organized radar presentation of the system does
suggest at least some damaging wind potential may occur downstream
of the eastern edge of WW590 in IL tonight. Conditions will continue
to be monitored should an additional watch be needed later this
evening.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 591
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
525 PM CDT Fri Aug 15 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Southern Minnesota
  Western Wisconsin

* Effective this Friday afternoon and evening from 525 PM until
  1100 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  Scattered large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Strong to severe thunderstorms will continue to develop
across the region through early evening. Hail will be possible, and
at least isolated damaging wind potential will exist, especially as
storms merge/organize as they progress east-southeastward.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 35
statute miles north and south of a line from 35 miles north of
Redwood Falls MN to 55 miles east southeast of Eau Claire WI. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU1).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 590...

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
1.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 550. Mean storm motion vector
28025.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0458 PM CDT Fri Aug 15 2025

Valid 171200Z - 231200Z

...Day 3/Sunday...
A mid-level trough across the Pacific Northwest along with a diffuse
frontal boundary along a corridor of Pacific moisture will promote a
mix of wet and dry thunderstorms from northern CA into the Northern
Rockies. Alignment of drier, more receptive fuels and faster
northeast thunderstorm motions limiting rainfall are expected across
northern NV into central ID. A 10 percent dry thunderstorm
probability was maintained to cover this threat. A dry southwest
flow pattern between the Pacific Northwest trough and upper-level
ridge across the Southern U.S. will promote sustained
south-southwest winds of up to 15 mph along with low daytime
relative humidity of around 15 percent across southern NV amid very
dry fuels. However, widespread critical fire weather conditions are
not expected.

...Day 4/Monday - Day 8/Friday...
Mid-level troughing will moderate fire weather concerns across the
Northwestern U.S. early next week while the Southern U.S.
mid/upper-level ridge begins to shift and strengthen into the Four
Corners region. Ridging amplifies well into the Northern Rockies by
Day 5/Tuesday with gradual expansion and westward propagation into
the West Coast by Day 8/Friday. Above normal surface temperatures
will similarly expand across most of the western U.S. by the end of
next week. A return of monsoon moisture into the Intermountain West
could pose a dry thunderstorm threat across the eastern Great Basin
beginning on Day 6/Wednesday translating northward to include UT by
Day 7/Thursday and WY by Day 8/Friday. Uncertainty in magnitude of
moisture return and subsequent thunderstorm coverage precludes
introducing dry thunderstorm probabilities at this time.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0257 PM CDT Fri Aug 15 2025

Valid 152000Z - 161200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THOUGH TONIGHT
FROM THE UPPER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY INTO SOUTH DAKOTA...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong to severe storms with damaging winds and large hail
are likely through tonight from the Upper Mississippi Valley into
South Dakota.

...Upper MS Valley through tonight...
Convection is ongoing in a cluster across north central IA, with
clear evidence of cold pool development and a bowing structure.  The
storms will likely continue to spread eastward/southeastward through
the afternoon while encountering a very unstable environment
characterized by surface temperatures in the upper 80s and
boundary-layer dewpoints in the low-mid 70s.  Cluster is expected to
be maintained given deep-layer shear vectors near 30 kt (oriented
west-northwest to east-southeast), and steep midlevel lapse rates
will support the potential for occasional damaging/severe outflow
gusts and isolated large hail with the strongest embedded updrafts.

Otherwise, a strengthening low-level warm advection regime will
develop tonight into MN along a slow-moving front, and atop the cold
pool from the ongoing IA storms.  Elevated buoyancy will remain
large, with the potential to support additional severe storm
development with occasional large hail and damaging/severe outflow
gusts. 

...NE/SD this evening into tonight...
High-based convection is expected to form this afternoon from
southeast WY into the western NE Panhandle and southwest SD.  The
initial storms will be capable of producing a few severe outflow
gusts in an environment with deep inverted-V profiles and modest
buoyancy.  Though surface convective inhibition will increase this
evening with diurnal cooling, storms could grow into a cluster
through outflow interactions, while moving into richer low-level
moisture and larger buoyancy with eastward extent (along and south
of a baroclinic zone across SD).

..Thompson.. 08/15/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1130 AM CDT Fri Aug 15 2025/

...MN/IA/WI...
Recent satellite imagery shows a pair of convectively generated
vorticity maxima moving across the northern/central Plains, with the
northernmost vorticity max over the eastern ND/SD border and the
southernmost vorticity max over north-central NE. Showers and
thunderstorms have persisted near these features over the last
several hours, but the strongest cells in both of these clusters
have recently shown a weakening trend. A moist and buoyant airmass,
characterized by dewpoints in the upper 60s/low 70s, exists
downstream and redevelopment is possible ahead of both of these
vorticity maxima. How that redevelopment evolves is uncertain, with
recent guidance offering varied solutions regarding overall coverage
and evolution. 

Redevelopment appears most probable with the southern vorticity
maxima, given the ample moist and buoyancy that exists downstream.
This development should grow upscale quickly, with the resulting
convective cluster then tracking southeastward. Recent guidance
continues to trend farther south, so the wind probabilities were
extended southward to cover this potential. Damaging gusts appear
like the most likely threat through the evening. Current progression
of the northern vorticity maximum takes it into a less buoyant
airmass across central MN and northern WI, and redevelopment
along/ahead of this disturbance appears less likely. 

Depending on the strength of the IA cluster, additional development
is possible in its wake amid a strengthening low-level jet and
associated warm-air advection over its outflow. Steep mid-level
lapse rates should still be in place, supporting strong updrafts and
large hail with these elevated storms. 

Lastly, a decaying convective line may reach the southwestern
MN/northwestern IA vicinity late in the period. Given the potential
for preceding storms, the amount of buoyancy that will still be in
place remains is uncertain. However, if thunderstorm coverage is low
or most storms develop farther east, enough buoyancy could remain to
support strong updrafts capable of damaging gusts and/or hail within
the convective line or any preceding more cellular storms.

..NE/SD this afternoon through tonight...
Strong heating and ample mid-level moisture will result in scattered
high-based thunderstorm development across eastern WY and western
NE/SD by late afternoon. Isolated hail and strong gusts are possible
with this initial activity. This activity will then track
east-northeastward through the early evening into a progressively
more moist and unstable air mass across NE and SD. The combination
of improving thermodynamic environment and an intensifying nocturnal
low-level jet will likely aid in thunderstorm intensification and
upscale growth through the evening across northern NE and central
SD. Guidance continues to vary significantly with the strength of
this MCS, but general consensus would suggest the threat for strong
to severe gusts will persist across SD tonight. There is at least a
low probability for the development of a well-organized MCS that
could produce significant severe gusts. However, that probability is
currently too low to introduce an unconditional sig wind area.

...TX Coastal Plain into the Hill Country and Southeast TX...
A maturing tropical disturbance is near south TX, with associated
outflow currently spreading northward across the TX Coastal Plain.
Limited lightning has been noted with in the short-lived cores that
have been developing along this outflow. This process of brief
intensification along this outflow is expected throughout the day,
with an overall increase in thunderstorm coverage anticipated. A
modest increase in low to mid-level flow is expected along the
eastern periphery of this system, spreading northward into central
and southeast TX. Even so, shear will remain weak, with a
disorganized multicellular pulse storm mode anticipated. Given the
very moist profiles (i.e. PW values over 2"), a few water-loaded
downbursts are possible, but should be isolated enough to preclude
the need for severe probabilities.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0253 PM CDT Fri Aug 15 2025

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

...Dry Thunderstorms...
A mid-level trough with an attendant cold front and associated
Pacific moisture pushing into the northwestern U.S. will be the
primary focus for showers and thunderstorms on Day 2 (Saturday). A
subtle mid-level wind maxima introducing increasing vertical wind
shear (35-40 knots) into southeastern OR and central ID will promote
faster northeastward thunderstorm trajectories. The thunderstorm
threat could extend into Saturday night/early Sunday morning given
lingering elevated instability and favorable shear profiles. Limited
rainfall could support new ignitions over dry fuels with outflow
winds impacting existing active fires across the area. 

...Great Basin...
Mid-level troughing across the Northwest should continue to promote
breezy and dry conditions across portions of southern/northeastern
NV and western UT. South-southwest winds of up to 15 mph along with
daytime relative humidity as low as 15% are expected in some valleys
in the Great Basin but not widespread enough to include Elevated
highlights at this time.

..Williams.. 08/15/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0200 AM CDT Fri Aug 15 2025/

...Synopsis...
Troughing over the West will gradually intensify Friday as central
US ridging also builds and gradually shifts eastward. As western US
troughing deepens, southwesterly flow aloft will continue over the
Great Basin and Intermountain West. A cold front will move through
the Northwest, bringing showers and thunderstorms to parts of OR, WA
and northern CA, while dry and breezy conditions will persist over
the southern Great Basin.

...Dry Thunderstorms...
Across the Northwest and central Rockies, persistent monsoon
moisture will be in palace ahead of the upper trough and advancing
cold front. Widespread wetting rainfall is expected across much of
the Pacific Northwest west of the Cascades. To the east, diurnal
heating and more modest moisture should support a relatively dry
boundary layer with drier storms. isolated to scattered storms are
expected along the cold front from eastern OR into western ID. While
some wetting rainfall is possible, the modest moisture and faster
storm speed should still support isolated dry thunder potential over
the Northeast and central Rockies Friday afternoon into the early
evening.

...Southern Great Basin...
As the western US trough slowly deepens, southwesterly flow aloft
will remain fairly modest over the West. Still, some increase is
expected over portions of southern NV and western UT. While not
overly strong, afternoon westerly winds near 15 mph appear possible
Friday afternoon. With low RH (below 15) locally elevated
fire-weather conditions will be possible for a few hours amidst dry
fuels. The lack of stronger winds for now precludes elevated
Highlights.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0227 PM CDT Fri Aug 15 2025

Valid 171200Z - 181200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM MONTANA
THROUGH THE UPPER MIDWEST AND SOUTHERN GREAT LAKES...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms with potential for isolated severe wind gusts and hail
will be possible on Sunday across parts of the northern Plains
eastward into Upper Midwest and southern Great Lakes.

...Northern Plains/Upper Midwest into the southern Great Lakes...
A flattened mid-level ridge will influence thunderstorm activity on
Sunday across a large part of the CONUS.  On the northern periphery
of the ridge, a weak mid-level disturbance is forecast to crest the
ridge over the north-central states and move from SD to the western
Great Lakes.  Warm 700-mb temperatures and an associated capping
inversion will likely limit storm development across the lower MO
Valley.  A composite surface boundary, likely modulated by previous
day's thunderstorm outflow, is forecast to be draped from the
southern Great Lakes west-northwestward into parts of the Upper
Midwest and into portions of the northern High Plains.  

Showers and storms may be ongoing early Sunday morning across the
Upper Midwest in association with weak low-level warm advection in
advance of the aforementioned impulse.  Isolated to scattered
diurnal storms are forecast to focus along the low-level boundary
during the afternoon/evening given large-scale upper forcing for
ascent will remain weak to negligible.  Despite expected strong
diurnal destabilization, deep-layer shear will likely remain modest
and limit storm organization potential, with isolated severe gusts
and large hail being the severe hazards.

Areas affected...northern/central IA and adjacent WI/MN/IL

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 589...

Valid 151841Z - 152015Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 589
continues.

SUMMARY...Strong to locally severe wind threat should increase into
late afternoon with an eastward-progressing cluster from
north-central Iowa. An additional Severe Thunderstorm Watch may be
warranted downstream.

DISCUSSION...Despite the presence of a cluster that has accelerated
to around 40-kt easterly movement, surface wind gusts appear to not
even be strong yet, which could be related to the initially elevated
character of the cluster and modest cold pool/warm sector
temperature differences from 10-15 F. MLCIN appears to be finally
minimizing downstream and thus strong to sporadic severe gusts
should develop on approach to peak heating as the cluster spreads
into the northeast IA vicinity. Hail growth will probably remain
limited and generally confined along the trailing west/southwest
flank where mid-level lapse rates remain steep per the 18Z OAX
sounding, but with only 20-kt effective bulk shear at this latitude.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR MUCH OF SOUTH
DAKOTA...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are possible Saturday over South
Dakota primarily during the late afternoon through the late evening
period.  Large hail and severe gusts appear to be the primary
hazards with the stronger storms.

...Northern Great Plains...
A mid-level ridge centered over the lower MS Valley/Mid South will
feature a weak disturbance moving from the WY/CO vicinity into the
Dakotas Saturday night.  A residual composite front will remain
draped east-west from the Upper Midwest into western SD, where it
will intersect a lee trough from the central High Plains
north-northwestward into eastern MT.  Although large-scale ascent
will remain fairly weak across the region, isolated thunderstorms
will likely develop in the vicinity of the lee trough and Black
Hills by the late afternoon as convective inhibition erodes.  To the
north of the front, a moist and unstable airmass featuring a
moderate to very unstable boundary layer will develop by mid-late
afternoon.  Model guidance shows a gradual increase in storm
coverage during the early evening over western/central SD.  Ample
directional shear will support effective shear magnitudes 30-40 kt
and storm organization with the stronger storms.  Large hail and
severe gusts appear to be the primary threats.

...Midwest...
A linear cluster of thunderstorms is expected to be ongoing Saturday
morning across parts of the Upper MS Valley/western Great Lakes. 
Model guidance differs on the evolution of this potentia
shower/thunderstorm activity, but west-northwesterly mid-level flow
poleward of a mid-level anticyclone centered over the lower MS
Valley, will potentially favor some continuation of storms
downstream across the southwestern Great Lakes.  Models continue to
show a moist/unstable airmass across southern portions of the Great
Lakes.  Although large-scale ascent will remain weak across the
region, regenerative storm development on remnant outflow may yield
a subsequent evolution of a storm cluster but uncertainty remains
high.  Isolated damaging gusts/hail are the main threats with these
storms.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1149 AM CDT Fri Aug 15 2025

Valid 151700Z - 161200Z

...Dry Thunderstorms...
Thermodynamic profiles continue to be supportive of dry thunderstorm
development over portions of Northeast NV into southern ID/western
WY and southward along the central UT mountain chain. Enhanced
southwesterly flow associated with a trough over the Great Basin
will support faster storm motions, particularly from a corridor from
northeastern Nevada into southeastern ID, further limiting rainfall
potential. A clearly evident, deeper moisture plume depicted by
satellite imagery currently translating northward from northern AZ
into eastern UT, should promote more wetting rain cores out of
expected higher terrain shower/thunderstorm development this
afternoon. PWATs across the Colorado Plateau and Western Slope
should remain at or above 0.80" limiting lightning ignition
efficiency in this region. Orographically forced convection and a
few thunderstorms with limited rainfall across the Central Sierra
Nevada mountains are also expected over increasingly dry fuels. 

...Southern Nevada, southeastern Idaho and far southwest Montana...
The mid-level trough will also support a swath of enhanced south to
southwest winds (15-20 mph) across southern and eastern NV as well
as portions of central ID mountains and Upper Snake River Plain. The
winds combined with a dry boundary layer and surface relative
humidity of 15% or below will promote elevated fire weather
conditions amid dry fuels.

..Williams.. 08/15/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0159 AM CDT Fri Aug 15 2025/

...Synopsis...
Broad mid-level ridging over the Central US is forecast to build
today, as weak westerly flow passes over it. Weak troughing over the
Great Basin will gradually shift eastward bolstering mid-level flow
over the region. A weak lee low over the High Plains will support
west/southwesterly winds over much of the Great Basin and
Intermountain West through this afternoon. 15-20 mph gusts will
overlap with very warm and dry conditions (RH below 15) from eastern
NV into portions of UT, WY and ID.  Several hours of elevated fire
weather conditions are probable given very dry and receptive fuels.

...Dry Thunder...
Weak height falls from the upper trough over the West will continue
to overspread robust monsoon moisture supporting isolated
thunderstorms this afternoon. Similar to previous days, a
combination of steep mid-level lapse rates and modest mid-level
moisture will overlap with dry boundary layer conditions and high
cloud bases. This will favor dry storms with limited potential for
wetting rainfall. The favorable thermodynamic conditions, coupled
with 15-25 knot storm motions over top receptive fuels will continue
to support dry lightning potential with these storms over the
eastern Great Basin and central Rockies.

Valid 151630Z - 161200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON AND
TONIGHT FROM PARTS OF SOUTH DAKOTA INTO THE UPPER MIDWEST...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong to severe storms are likely today and tonight over
parts of the northern Plains and Upper Mississippi Valley.

...MN/IA/WI...
Recent satellite imagery shows a pair of convectively generated
vorticity maxima moving across the northern/central Plains, with the
northernmost vorticity max over the eastern ND/SD border and the
southernmost vorticity max over north-central NE. Showers and
thunderstorms have persisted near these features over the last
several hours, but the strongest cells in both of these clusters
have recently shown a weakening trend. A moist and buoyant airmass,
characterized by dewpoints in the upper 60s/low 70s, exists
downstream and redevelopment is possible ahead of both of these
vorticity maxima. How that redevelopment evolves is uncertain, with
recent guidance offering varied solutions regarding overall coverage
and evolution. 

Redevelopment appears most probable with the southern vorticity
maxima, given the ample moist and buoyancy that exists downstream.
This development should grow upscale quickly, with the resulting
convective cluster then tracking southeastward. Recent guidance
continues to trend farther south, so the wind probabilities were
extended southward to cover this potential. Damaging gusts appear
like the most likely threat through the evening. Current progression
of the northern vorticity maximum takes it into a less buoyant
airmass across central MN and northern WI, and redevelopment
along/ahead of this disturbance appears less likely. 

Depending on the strength of the IA cluster, additional development
is possible in its wake amid a strengthening low-level jet and
associated warm-air advection over its outflow. Steep mid-level
lapse rates should still be in place, supporting strong updrafts and
large hail with these elevated storms. 

Lastly, a decaying convective line may reach the southwestern
MN/northwestern IA vicinity late in the period. Given the potential
for preceding storms, the amount of buoyancy that will still be in
place remains is uncertain. However, if thunderstorm coverage is low
or most storms develop farther east, enough buoyancy could remain to
support strong updrafts capable of damaging gusts and/or hail within
the convective line or any preceding more cellular storms.

..NE/SD this afternoon through tonight...
Strong heating and ample mid-level moisture will result in scattered
high-based thunderstorm development across eastern WY and western
NE/SD by late afternoon. Isolated hail and strong gusts are possible
with this initial activity. This activity will then track
east-northeastward through the early evening into a progressively
more moist and unstable air mass across NE and SD. The combination
of improving thermodynamic environment and an intensifying nocturnal
low-level jet will likely aid in thunderstorm intensification and
upscale growth through the evening across northern NE and central
SD. Guidance continues to vary significantly with the strength of
this MCS, but general consensus would suggest the threat for strong
to severe gusts will persist across SD tonight. There is at least a
low probability for the development of a well-organized MCS that
could produce significant severe gusts. However, that probability is
currently too low to introduce an unconditional sig wind area.

...TX Coastal Plain into the Hill Country and Southeast TX...
A maturing tropical disturbance is near south TX, with associated
outflow currently spreading northward across the TX Coastal Plain.
Limited lightning has been noted with in the short-lived cores that
have been developing along this outflow. This process of brief
intensification along this outflow is expected throughout the day,
with an overall increase in thunderstorm coverage anticipated. A
modest increase in low to mid-level flow is expected along the
eastern periphery of this system, spreading northward into central
and southeast TX. Even so, shear will remain weak, with a
disorganized multicellular pulse storm mode anticipated. Given the
very moist profiles (i.e. PW values over 2"), a few water-loaded
downbursts are possible, but should be isolated enough to preclude
the need for severe probabilities.
