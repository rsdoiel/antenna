Mesoscale Discussion 1856
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0334 PM CDT Thu Jul 31 2025

Areas affected...portions of southern/central Idaho and southwestern
Montana

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 312034Z - 312130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Potential for strong to severe winds with thunderstorm
activity this afternoon and evening.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorm activity has developed across portions of
southern Idaho near the Snake River Plain and Sawtooth Range. This
is expected to continue to move northward this afternoon, with
potential for strong to severe winds. Temperatures across
southern/central Idaho are in the mid to upper 80s, with large dew
point spreads around 40 degrees noted in surface observations.
Surface objective analysis shows steep low to mid-level lapse rates
around 8.5-9 C/km. This environment will be supportive of strong
downburst potential. As storms cluster and grow along outflow, a
more organized damaging wind threat may emerge.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0302 PM CDT Thu Jul 31 2025

Areas affected...parts of southern Pennsylvania...New
Jersey...Delaware...much of Maryland and northern Virginia into the
eastern West Virginia panhandle

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 562...

Valid 312002Z - 312200Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 562
continues.

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm activity may continue to develop and
intensify across the Greater Washington D.C. into Baltimore
vicinities through 5-6 PM EDT, accompanied by a risk for potentially
damaging wind gusts.

DISCUSSION...The environment across much of the northern Mid
Atlantic, from Greater Philadelphia into the Greater New York City
area, is becoming substantially impacted by convective precipitation
and outflow.  In the wake of this activity, it appears that the
surface front is beginning to advance across and south of the
southern Pennsylvania state border, into a seasonably moist
boundary-layer still supporting sizable CAPE across the eastern West
Virginia panhandle through the Greater Washington D.C./Baltimore
area, where shear remains at least marginally conducive to organized
convective development near the southern fringe of the westerlies.

Mesoscale Discussion 1853
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0236 PM CDT Thu Jul 31 2025

Areas affected...parts of southwestern Arkansas into northeastern
Texas and northern Louisiana

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 311936Z - 312130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Potential for strong to severe wind gusts may increase
with a cluster of storms spreading toward the Ark-La-Tex through 4-5
PM CDT, before activity tends to weaken to the south and southwest
of the region.

DISCUSSION...Vigorous convective development continues a general
slow south/southwestward propagation, in the presence of weakly
sheared light northerly deep-layer mean flow.  The most recent
flareup southwest through south of Hot Springs has contributed to
further strengthening of an associated cold pool, with 2-hourly
surface pressure rises in excess of 2 mb noted in 19Z observations
at Arkadelphia and a 28 degree F differential in temperature across
the cold pool between Arkadelphia and Texarkana.

Aided by low-level updraft inflow of seasonably high boundary-layer
moisture content characterized by large CAPE, renewed vigorous
thunderstorm development is ongoing near/just ahead of the
southwestward propagating segment of the outflow across southwestern
Arkansas, toward Texarkana, with an expanding area of northward
spreading anvil-level precipitation in its wake.  As this continues
through the next hour or two, it appears possible that
north-northeasterly rear inflow may strengthen/descend and pose
increasing potential for strong to severe gusts across the
Ark-La-Texas vicinity, before the storms encounter more stable
updraft inflow and weaken.

Tropical Storm Gil Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072025
1100 AM HST Thu Jul 31 2025
 
Gil has been holding steady since the last advisory.  A 
scatterometer pass from 1729 UTC showed the low-level center near 
the northern edge of the Central Dense Overcast (CDO) suggesting the 
cyclone is experiencing moderate vertical wind shear.  The initial 
intensity is held at 45 kt for this cycle, in agreement with the 
TAFB and SAB Dvorak estimates.  While the scatterometer pass only 
covered the western half of the storm, it did provide information 
used to update some of the tropical-storm-force radii.

The motion is west-northwestward at 11 kt along the southern 
periphery of a mid-level ridge centered over the Baja California 
peninsula.  This general motion, with a gradual increase in forward 
speed, should continue through the weekend.  By early next week, 
Gil should turn more westward in the trade winds.  Only slight 
adjustments have been made to the latest official track forecast.

Global models predict that the vertical wind shear should 
gradually abate over the next 12 hours or so.  After this occurs, 
the warm sea surface temperatures and ample mid-level moisture 
should allow Gil to continue to strengthen for the next day or so.  
By Saturday, the storm is expected to cross the 26 degree isotherm 
and move over progressively cooler waters.  This should induce a 
steady-to-rapid weakening trend through the end of the forecast 
period.  Gil is still predicted to lose its organized deep 
convection and become a remnant low by day 4.  The intensity 
guidance predictions have decreased somewhat this cycle and the 
official forecast now lies near the upper end of the guidance 
envelope.

Tropical Storm Iona Discussion Number  19
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 AM HST Thu Jul 31 2025

Iona is still generating a large area of strong but disorganized 
convection over the low-level center.  An earlier partial SSMI/S 
overpass suggest the convection had poorly-defined banding, and 
that the low-level center may have become elongated. Satellite 
intensity estimated have increased a little over the past several 
hours and now are in the 40-60 kt range. The intensity will be held 
at 45 kt for now.
 
The initial motion is now 285/19 kt. Iona is expected to continue
west-northwestward with a decrease in forward speed for the next 
two to three days as it moves along along the southern periphery of 
a low- to mid-level subtropical ridge located to the north. After 
60-72 h, the models have come into better agreement than Iona should 
turn northwestward toward a break in the subtropical ridge west of 
160E, with the formerly more westward GFS joining the more 
northward ECMWF/Canadian.  The model guidance envelope has shifted 
to the right since the last advisory, and while the new forecast 
track is also shifted to the right it still lies to the left of the 
center of the envelope and the consensus models.

Iona continues to be affected by 20-25 kt of northwesterly shear.
This should continue for the next 24 h or so, and during this time 
the storm is expected to weaken some.  Subsequently, the shear is 
forecast to decrease, but the global models forecast the cyclone to 
move close to an upper-level low or trough. It is not clear at this 
time whether this will be favorable or unfavorable for Iona to 
re-intensify, as small changes in the relative positions of the 
systems could make a large difference in how much intensification 
might occur.  After 96 h, the global models agree that Iona should 
weaken, possibly due to upper-level convergence and dry air 
entrainment. In contrast, the HAFS regional hurricane models 
forecast re-intensification at that time. Overall, the intensity 
guidance has trended higher since the last advisory. Due to the 
uncertainties, the new intensity forecast will not yet make 
significant changes and is an update of the previous forecast. 
However, it lies near the lower end of the intensity guidance.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 562
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
115 PM EDT Thu Jul 31 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  District Of Columbia
  Delaware
  Maryland
  New Jersey
  Southeast New York
  Southern into Eastern Pennsylvania
  Northern and Eastern Virginia
  Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia
  Coastal Waters

* Effective this Thursday afternoon and evening from 115 PM until
  800 PM EDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 65 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1 inch in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Scattered to numerous thunderstorms are forecast to
develop and intensify this afternoon.  Several clusters of
thunderstorms will likely focus a risk for strong to severe wind
gusts capable of wind damage.  This activity will likely persist
into the early evening before diminishing or moving east of the
coast.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 95
statute miles east and west of a line from 10 miles east northeast
of Allentown PA to 50 miles southwest of Patuxent River MD. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU2).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
1 inch. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 55 knots. A few
cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 550. Mean storm motion vector
27020.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0315 PM CDT Thu Jul 31 2025

Valid 021200Z - 081200Z

...Great Basin...
Dry and windy conditions are generally expected each day through
mid/late next week. Deterministic/ensemble guidance shows greater
divergence toward the end of next week, but these conditions could
potentially linger even into next weekend. The main point of
uncertainty is the evolution of the upper trough in the West.
Cyclonic flow in the Northwest is the expected pattern, but how far
south/southeast the belt of stronger mid-level winds reaches is not
clear. Critical fire weather probabilities may need to be increased
in subsequent outlooks, but inter-model and run-to-run consistency
are too low at this point to confidently highlight a 70% area.

...Northwest...
Potential for thunderstorms will likely persist in the Northwest
through the weekend. This will primarily affect parts of Oregon.
With repeated days of convection plus the previous precipitation
that has fallen, concern for large fires should be trending
downward. Furthermore, storm motions will be slow until perhaps
Sunday where an approaching trough will move storms more quickly
northeastward. Overall, the threat for ignition of large fires is
too marginal for dry thunderstorm highlights. Another model trend
worth watching will be the track/timing of a forecast trough
mid/late next week. Winds would strengthen, but RH broadly falling
to critical levels is uncertain given the signal for clouds/cooler
temperatures. Some increase in fire activity from recent lightning
could occur if drier conditions were to occur.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THERE IS A SLIGHT
RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR PORTIONS OF THE MID-ATLANTIC STATES
AND FROM THE COLORADO FRONT RANGE INTO EASTERN AND NORTHERN
WYOMING...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms capable of damaging winds are possible this
afternoon and early evening across the Mid-Atlantic region. Other
severe wind and hail producing storms are also possible across the
central/northern High Plains.

...20z Update...
The forecast remains largely on track with only minor adjustments
made based on recent convective trends. Low-end/5% risk
probabilities were expanded slightly across portions of the northern
Rockies where recent observed dewpoint depressions and short-range
forecast soundings show low-level thermodynamic environments
favorable for strong/severe downburst winds and GOES imagery shows
deepening convection. Elsewhere, the forecast remains on track. See
the previous discussion below and MCDs #1853 and #1854 for
additional details.

..Moore.. 07/31/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1115 AM CDT Thu Jul 31 2025/

...Mid Atlantic Region...
Midday visible-satellite imagery indicates a moist airmass via a
swelling cumulus field from the upper OH Valley eastward into the
Mid-Atlantic states and Long Island.  Additional heating of an
extremely moist boundary layer (12 UTC raobs at IAD and WAL showing
17-18 g/kg lowest 100-mb mean mixing ratios), will result in
temperatures warming through the 80s deg F with 74-78 dewpoints to
the east of the Fall Line.  

An upstream mid-level shortwave trough over WI/IL will continue to
progress eastward towards the region and promote the gradual
southward movement of a weak cold front.  Despite weak mid-level
lapse rates, the aforementioned warming/destabilization through mid
afternoon will promote scattered thunderstorms along/ahead of
the front.  Forecast hodographs will be elongated due to 50-70 kt
upper-level flow, which will support storm organization in the form
of multicell clusters and possibly a few weak supercell structures. 
Weak low-level flow and a deep/moisture-rich profile will facilitate
water-loaded downdrafts with the stronger cores.  Widely scattered
50-65 mph gusts capable of wind damage will be the primary severe
concern before much of this activity moves east of the coast by mid
evening.

...High Plains...
No change from the previous forecast thinking.  Weak shortwave
ridging will reside across the central Rockies/plains northward into
the northern High Plains.  Surface observations and satellite data
depict a seasonably moist airmass abutted to the Front Range and
northward into the eastern WY.  Heating over the higher terrain and
along a residual frontal zone will aid in scattered storm
development this afternoon.  The strongest cells will pose some risk
of hail and gusty winds over the higher terrain before spreading
onto the plains by late afternoon.  Forecast soundings in this
region show moderately steep mid-level lapse rates, MLCAPE values of
1000-1500 J/kg, and sufficient vertical shear for transient
supercell structures.  Upscale growth into a linear cluster or two
may evolve (supported by recent HREF guidance), and this appears
most probable near the WY/CO/NE border during the early evening.  A
gradual transition from primarily a hail risk to a threat favoring
severe gusts may occur as outflow becomes more pervasive as storm
coverage and outflow increases during the evening.

...ID/Western MT...
A mid-level trough over northern NV will move slowly northward
through tonight into the northern Rockies.  Forcing for ascent
attendant to this upper feature coupled with orographic circulations
will likely result in scattered storms developing by mid to late
afternoon.  Very steep lapse rates and dry sub-cloud layers will
promote evaporative cooling and an isolated risk for severe gusts
(60-70 mph) with the stronger cores and outflow surges.

...AR/LA...
Scattered diurnally driven storms will likely evolve in the vicinity
of a weakness in the southern U.S. mid-level anticyclone.  A very
moist boundary layer amid moderate buoyancy may result in a few
stronger water-loaded microbursts capable of 50-65 mph gusts and
pockets of wind damage.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0221 PM CDT Thu Jul 31 2025

Valid 021200Z - 031200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...AND OVER PORTIONS OF THE
SOUTHEAST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe storms capable of large hail and severe wind gusts
are expected in the central and southern High Plains vicinity on
Saturday. Additional strong storms are possible across the
Southeast.

...Central/Southern High Plains...

The upper ridge over the Rockies will flatten on Saturday, while a
weak shortwave trough migrates across the Four Corners and into the
southern/central High Plains. South/southeasterly low-level flow
will maintain upper 50s to low 60s F dewpoints (perhaps mid 60s over
parts of western KS into the OK/TX Panhandles). Steep midlevel lapse
rates will support moderate to strong destabilization and
thunderstorms are likely to develop by late afternoon. Vertical
shear is forecast to remain modest, but sufficient for organized
cells capable of producing locally strong outflow winds and hail.
With time during the evening, some forecast guidance suggests
upscale growth could occur across western KS with a small cluster or
MCS moving southeast into parts of northwest OK and the OK/TX
Panhandles. If this occurs, damaging wind potential may increase. If
confidence in this evolution increases, higher outlook probabilities
may be necessary in subsequent outlooks.

...Southeast...

A surface cold front will be located in the vicinity of southern AL
into southern GA on Saturday. A seasonally very moist and strongly
unstable airmass will exist near the boundary. While deep layer
shear will be weak, the boundary could become a focus for clustering
of thunderstorm activity. Given PW values greater than 2 inches,
some potential will exist for wet microbursts and/or forward
propagating clusters along outflows producing sporadic/locally
damaging gusts.

No changes to the ongoing forecast. Thunderstorms are possible
farther west/northwest in northern California and southwest Oregon.
However, storm motions appear that they will be too slow for a
significant threat of ignitions. Additionally, locally elevated
conditions are possible from southern Nevada into southwest Utah.
Winds generally appear too weak (less than 15 mph) or short in
duration for highlights.

..Wendt.. 07/31/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0307 AM CDT Thu Jul 31 2025/

...Synopsis...
Broad upper troughing will persist over the Interior West, with at
least one pronounced mid-level impulse expected to traverse the
upper trough over the northern Great Basin tomorrow (Friday). Upper
support with the embedded impulse will support high-based
thunderstorm development atop a dry boundary layer over the northern
Great Basin. During the afternoon, both wet and dry thunderstorms
should produce dry strikes over receptive fuel beds, necessitating
isolated dry thunderstorm highlights.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1217 PM CDT Thu Jul 31 2025

Valid 011200Z - 021200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS
OF THE HIGH PLAINS AND OVER THE SOUTHEAST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated to potentially scattered severe storms are possible
throughout the High Plains and across portions of the Southeast on
Friday. Strong wind gusts and large hail will be possible with the
strongest storms.

...High Plains...

An upper ridge centered over the Rockies will remain stationary on
Friday. Several weak shortwave impulses will migrate through modest
westerly flow within the upper ridge. Very steep midlevel lapse
rates atop a seasonally moist airmass will support a narrow corridor
of moderate to strong destabilization from northeast NM into western
SD and vicinity. Southeasterly low-level upslope flow will support
thunderstorm development by mid to late afternoon. While vertical
shear will remain modest, increasing winds above 500 mb and
vertically veering low-level winds could be sufficient for a few
supercells. Large hail will be possible with the strongest storms.
Deep boundary layer mixing and strong heating also will result in
steep low-level lapse rates and isolated strong/severe wind gusts
also will be possible. Higher outlook probabilities may be needed in
subsequent outlooks if confidence increases in greater storm
coverage/organization within the broader Marginal risk (level 1 of
5) area.

...Southeast...

An upper trough will shift east across the Great Lakes and Northeast
on Friday. Strengthening surface high pressure over the Great
Lakes/Midwest will drive a cold front south across the Carolinas and
much of the Southeast toward the Gulf Coast. Ahead of the front, a
very moist and unstable airmass will be in place from southern NC
into SC/GA. The highest concentration of thunderstorm clusters is
expected ahead of the southward surging wedge front from southern NC
into SC/GA. Vertical shear and lapse rates will remain weak, but 2+
inch PW values amid moderate/strong instability could result in wet
microbursts. Some stronger forward propagating clusters also are
possible as the cold front interacts with the cold front near the
southeast NC/SC coastal plain.

No changes to the ongoing forecast.

..Wendt.. 07/31/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0247 AM CDT Thu Jul 31 2025/

...Synopsis...
Broad mid-level troughing will overspread the Interior West today,
with multiple mid-level impulses poised to pivot around the trough
through the Day 1 period. Upper support with a glancing mid-level
impulse will encourage dry and windy conditions across portions of
the eastern Great Basin. 20+ mph sustained southwesterly surface
winds amid 15 percent RH will overspread dry fuels for several hours
during the afternoon, warranting Critical highlights. 

Mid-level moisture will continue to advect northward across the
Pacific Northwest and overspread a relatively dry low-level airmass.
High-based thunderstorms will develop during the afternoon and
evening hours, with a mix of wet and dry storms possible. Given
receptive fuels, isolated dry thunderstorm highlights have been
added.

1115 AM CDT Thu Jul 31 2025

Valid 311630Z - 011200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR PORTIONS OF
THE MID-ATLANTIC STATES AND FROM THE COLORADO FRONT RANGE INTO
EASTERN AND NORTHERN WYOMING...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms capable of damaging winds are possible this
afternoon and early evening across the Mid-Atlantic region. Other
severe wind and hail producing storms are also possible across the
central/northern High Plains.

...Mid Atlantic Region...
Midday visible-satellite imagery indicates a moist airmass via a
swelling cumulus field from the upper OH Valley eastward into the
Mid-Atlantic states and Long Island.  Additional heating of an
extremely moist boundary layer (12 UTC raobs at IAD and WAL showing
17-18 g/kg lowest 100-mb mean mixing ratios), will result in
temperatures warming through the 80s deg F with 74-78 dewpoints to
the east of the Fall Line.  

An upstream mid-level shortwave trough over WI/IL will continue to
progress eastward towards the region and promote the gradual
southward movement of a weak cold front.  Despite weak mid-level
lapse rates, the aforementioned warming/destabilization through mid
afternoon will promote scattered thunderstorms along/ahead of
the front.  Forecast hodographs will be elongated due to 50-70 kt
upper-level flow, which will support storm organization in the form
of multicell clusters and possibly a few weak supercell structures. 
Weak low-level flow and a deep/moisture-rich profile will facilitate
water-loaded downdrafts with the stronger cores.  Widely scattered
50-65 mph gusts capable of wind damage will be the primary severe
concern before much of this activity moves east of the coast by mid
evening.

...High Plains...
No change from the previous forecast thinking.  Weak shortwave
ridging will reside across the central Rockies/plains northward into
the northern High Plains.  Surface observations and satellite data
depict a seasonably moist airmass abutted to the Front Range and
northward into the eastern WY.  Heating over the higher terrain and
along a residual frontal zone will aid in scattered storm
development this afternoon.  The strongest cells will pose some risk
of hail and gusty winds over the higher terrain before spreading
onto the plains by late afternoon.  Forecast soundings in this
region show moderately steep mid-level lapse rates, MLCAPE values of
1000-1500 J/kg, and sufficient vertical shear for transient
supercell structures.  Upscale growth into a linear cluster or two
may evolve (supported by recent HREF guidance), and this appears
most probable near the WY/CO/NE border during the early evening.  A
gradual transition from primarily a hail risk to a threat favoring
severe gusts may occur as outflow becomes more pervasive as storm
coverage and outflow increases during the evening.

...ID/Western MT...
A mid-level trough over northern NV will move slowly northward
through tonight into the northern Rockies.  Forcing for ascent
attendant to this upper feature coupled with orographic circulations
will likely result in scattered storms developing by mid to late
afternoon.  Very steep lapse rates and dry sub-cloud layers will
promote evaporative cooling and an isolated risk for severe gusts
(60-70 mph) with the stronger cores and outflow surges.

...AR/LA...
Scattered diurnally driven storms will likely evolve in the vicinity
of a weakness in the southern U.S. mid-level anticyclone.  A very
moist boundary layer amid moderate buoyancy may result in a few
stronger water-loaded microbursts capable of 50-65 mph gusts and
pockets of wind damage.

0736 AM CDT Thu Jul 31 2025

Valid 311300Z - 011200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON AND
EVENING OVER PORTIONS OF NORTH-CENTRAL COLORADO AND EASTERN
WYOMING...AND PARTS OF THE MID ATLANTIC REGION...

...SUMMARY...
A few severe storms capable of damaging winds are possible this
afternoon across the Mid-Atlantic region. Other severe wind and hail
producing storms are also possible across the central/northern High
Plains.

...High Plains...
A broad upper ridge remains in place across most of the southern US,
with a weak trough over the western states.  A plume of monsoonal
moisture extends from NM into CO/WY/MT, leading to another round of
afternoon thunderstorms across the Rockies.  The strongest cells
will pose some risk of hail and gusty winds over the higher terrain
before spreading onto the plains by late afternoon.  Forecast
soundings in this region show moderately steep mid-level lapse
rates, MLCAPE values of 1000-1500 J/kg, and sufficient vertical
shear for transient supercell structures.  This may be sufficient
for widely scattered severe storms capable of large hail and
damaging winds.

...Mid Atlantic Region...
A weak cold front continues to sag southward across parts of PA and
far southern New England this morning.  Strong heating to the south
of the boundary, coupled with a very moist air mass will lead to
moderate afternoon MLCAPE values - despite weak mid-level lapse
rates.  Scattered thunderstorms are expected to form along/ahead of
the front by mid-afternoon.  A few severe storms are possible, with
locally damaging wind gusts being the main concern.

...ID/Western MT...
A shortwave trough is noted in morning water vapor imagery over NV
lifting northward.  Large scale forcing for ascent ahead of the
trough will foster scattered high-based thunderstorms this afternoon
across parts of ID and western MT.  The strongest cells will be
capable of gusty/damaging wind gusts.

...DISCUSSION...
The extended range will primarily feature the potential for
Northwest flow severe across the Plains. Moderate to strong
instability is expected to build across the central Plains and into
parts of the northern Plains. A mid-level trough off the California
coast at the beginning of the period is forecast to move northward
and eventually into southern Canada. Beyond this time, the forecast
uncertainty increases. Both the ECMWF and GFS suggest some troughing
will advance toward the Midwest/Great Lakes, but the amplitude
varies. This will have significant impact on the potential locations
of severe weather and the potential for the threat to extend east of
the Plains/Upper Midwest. Regardless of the exact solution of the
extended range pattern, moderate mid-level flow will likely
overspread much of the northern Plains and potentially portions of
the central Plains. Where this mid-level flow interacts with the
developing instability and thunderstorms, some severe weather is
possible. However, the uncertain timing and evolution of the pattern
makes identification of these corridors challenging and precludes
severe weather probabilities at this time.

Tropical Storm Gil Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072025
1100 PM HST Wed Jul 30 2025

Satellite imagery indicates that the disturbance NHC has been 
tracking for the past several days has become much better organized 
during the past 12 hours.  The latest subjective Dvorak estimates 
are 2.5/35 kt from TAFB and 1.5/25 kt from SAB.  A 0457 UTC ASCAT-B 
pass showed a well-defined circulation with peak winds near 35 kt. 
Since that time, the convective organization has continued to 
improve significantly, with a central convective area containing 
cloud tops that are becoming colder and more circular on infrared 
imagery, along with developing banding features.  The system is 
upgraded to Tropical Storm Gil based on the above data, and the 
initial intensity estimate is 40 kt to reflect the improved 
structure since the time of the ASCAT pass.

Gil is moving westward, or 275/13 kt.  The track forecast is fairly 
straightforward.  A mid-level ridge to the north of Gil will steer 
the cyclone west-northwestward for the next 3 to 4 days.  As Gil 
weakens and becomes shallow, it should bend more to the west by day 
4.  The track forecast is near the middle of the guidance envelope 
and is close to the TVCE consensus.

Gil is currently located in a moist environment with warm 
sea-surface temperatures and low to moderate vertical wind shear, 
and the cyclone is forecast to strengthen to a hurricane over the 
next 36 h.  The shear is forecast to decrease further over the next 
24 h while upper-level divergence increases.  Given the current 
impressive outflow and relatively fast recent development trends, it 
is possible Gil could strengthen a bit more than forecast over the 
next day or two.  However, Gil is forecast to reach colder water and 
more stable conditions by hour 48 as it gains latitude, which should 
lead to weakening.  The NHC intensity forecast is near the middle of 
the guidance envelope.  Gil is forecast to lose its convection and 
become a remnant low by day 5.

Tropical Storm Iona Discussion Number  17
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 PM HST Wed Jul 30 2025
 
Satellite imagery indicates that convection has become more 
concentrated over the center of Iona, with a recent convective burst 
producing cloud tops as cold as -85 C. This burst has obscured the 
previously exposed low-level circulation center, though the overall 
structure generally remains disorganized. Subjective Dvorak current 
intensity estimates ranged from 2.5/35 kt (JTWC) to 3.0/45 kt (SAB), 
with HFO at 3.5/55 kt. These values are mostly consistent with 
objective satellite intensity estimates, which ranged from 30 to 40 
kt. Based on a blend of these estimates and the current satellite 
presentation, the initial intensity is held at 45 kt.

The initial motion is estimated at 280/20 kt. Iona is expected to 
continue moving westward over the next day or two along the southern 
periphery of a low- to mid-level subtropical ridge located to the 
north. By 48 to 60 hours, a gradual turn toward the west-northwest 
and a decrease in forward speed are anticipated as the system 
approaches a weakness in the ridge. The forecast track remains 
consistent with the previous advisory and is well supported by the 
latest consensus guidance.

Only slight additional weakening is expected in the short term as 
Iona remains embedded within a moderate westerly shear environment 
of 20 to 25 kt. By around 60 hours (Saturday), vertical shear is 
forecast to relax, which could allow the cyclone to hold steady or 
even briefly restrengthen as it moves over slightly warmer waters. 
However, conditions are expected to deteriorate again late this 
weekend through early next week, with increasing shear and mid-level 
dry air likely leading to weakening. The intensity forecast has been 
held steady from the the previous advisory, supported by the recent 
burst of convection and the latest guidance. This forecast assumes 
that Iona will maintain enough convection to remain a tropical 
cyclone, but if convection fails to persist, the system could 
degenerate into a remnant low sooner than currently indicated.

Remnants Of Keli Discussion Number  10
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP022025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 AM HST Wed Jul 30 2025
 
Convection associated with Keli has largely collapsed.  Based on
the geostationary visible imagery, it appears the low-level
circulation has opened into a trough on the northern side of Iona.
The remnants of Keli are moving westward at around 15 kt within
the northeastern circulation of Iona and this motion is expected
to continue for the next day or so.

This will be the last advisory issued for Keli.  For additional 
information, see the High Seas Forecasts issued by the National 
Weather Service under WMO header FZPN02 KWBC and AWIPS header 
NFDHSFEPI.

Tropical Storm Iona Discussion Number  15
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 AM HST Wed Jul 30 2025
 
Iona continues to rapidly weaken, as the low-level center is now 
seen in visible imagery exposed well to the west-northwest of the 
remaining poorly-organized convection.  Subjective and objective 
satellite intensity estimates again have decreased significantly 
and currently are in the 40-65 kt range. Based on a blend of these 
estimates, the initial intensity is reduced to a possibly generous 
55 kt, and Iona is downgraded to a tropical storm.
 
The initial motion is 275/19 kt. There is little change in the 
forecast philosophy from the past couple of forecasts, as a general 
westward motion is expected to continue during the next day or two 
while Iona moves along the southern periphery of a low- to mid-level
subtropical ridge to the north.  A turn toward the west-northwest
and a gradual decrease in forward speed are expected after 48 h as 
the system is steered into a weakness in the ridge.  There has been 
little change in the forecast guidance since the last advisory, and 
the new forecast track is similar to the previous track.

Rapid weakening should continue for the next 12 h or so due to
westerly vertical shear and a track over cooler sea surface 
temperatures.  After that, the intensity forecast shows a period of 
little change in strength as sea surface temperatures begin to warm 
along the forecast track and the atmospheric conditions become a 
little more favorable. After 72 h, Iona should again weaken as it 
encounters mid-level dry air and another bout of vertical shear.  
The intensity forecast was again lowered below the previous 
forecast based on the current intensity trends.  Note that the 
intensity forecast is based on the premise that Iona will re-develop 
enough convection to sustain the system as a tropical cyclone. If 
this does not happen, the cyclone could degenerate to a remnant low 
or trough before 120 h.

and severe wind gusts will be possible this afternoon into the
evening. However, given that widespread severe storms are not
expected at this time, the likelihood of weather watch issuance is
low.

DISCUSSION...Scattered thunderstorm have developed across portions
of western and central Wyoming this afternoon, in an environment
characterized by 1000-1500 J/kg MUCAPE and 45-40 kts of effective
deep-layer shear. While there is sufficient shear for some storms to
become more intense and organized, the expectation is that any
severe storms will largely be isolated and transient in nature. Any
organized convection would be capable of 60 MPH wind gusts and any
hail is expected to remain below 2.00 inches in size. 

While the probability of watch issuance is expected to remain low,
convective trends will continue to be monitored.

Tropical Storm Keli Discussion Number   8
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP022025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 PM HST Tue Jul 29 2025

Satellite imagery shows that Keli continues to produce organized 
deep convection, and the latest subjective Dvorak numbers from SAB, 
PHFO and JTWC are a consensus 2.5/2.5.  The recent objective 
intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS range from 30 to 40 kt.  The 
advisory intensity estimate is held at 35 kt.  The storm remains 
quite small with only about a 30 n mi extent of 34-kt winds from the 
center.
 
Keli is moving faster, with the motion estimated to be westward, or 
280/18 kt.  This faster westward motion is due to its proximity to 
the east-northeast of Iona, as well as the mid-level ridging 
located well to the north of the cyclone.  The track guidance is in 
good agreement, and the official forecast has been nudged to show a 
slightly faster forward motion.

Although Keli is hanging on as a tropical storm for the moment, it
is not likely to last for more than another day or so.  Increasing 
vertical wind shear from the outflow of Iona is likely to cause
weakening, and Keli's inflow should be soon disrupted by Iona's
low-level circulation.  The official forecast calls for weakening 
and dissipation in 36 hours or so.  The global models indicate 
that dissipation could occur a bit sooner than forecast.

Hurricane Iona Discussion Number  13
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 PM HST Tue Jul 29 2025
 
The satellite presentation has continued to deteriorate this 
evening, with the low-level center of Iona obscured by a central 
dense overcast with gradually warming cloud top temperatures.  The 
cyclone is continuing to be influenced by increasing westerly 
vertical wind shear while also moving over cooler sea surface 
temperatures around or slightly below 27C, as depicted by the 
Real-time, Global, Sea Surface Temperature Analysis.  The latest 
subjective Dvorak current intensity estimates ranged from 
4.5/77 knots to 5.5/102 knots, while the latest objective intensity 
estimates range from 77 to 87 knots.  Taking a blend of these data 
the initial intensity has been lowered to 90 knots for this 
advisory.
 
Iona is moving westward, or 275 degrees, at 15 knots.  This general 
motion is expected to continue during the next couple of days as the 
cyclone moves along the southern periphery of a subtropical ridge to 
the north.  A turn toward the west-northwest and a gradual decrease 
in forward speed is expected late in the week and over the weekend, 
as the system is steered into a weakness in the mid-level ridge to 
the north.  The official track forecast remains near the center of 
the tightly clustered guidance envelope and is very close to the 
previous advisory. Confidence remains high that Iona will stay well 
south of the Hawaiian Islands.

The cyclone is expected to undergo rapid weakening tonight and 
Wednesday as it experiences increasing westerly vertical wind shear 
while also moving over cooler sea surface temperatures of 26.5 to 
27C.  The intensity forecast then shows little change in strength 
Thursday through Friday as sea surface temperatures begin to warm, 
vertical wind shear gradually eases, and mid-level moisture 
increases.  Iona should then begin to gradually weaken by days 4 
and 5 as the mid-levels dry out and the system becomes influenced by 
increasing westerly and southwesterly vertical wind shear.  The 
official forecast was adjusted to account for the latest intensity 
guidance trends, and lies pretty close to the middle of the guidance 
envelope.

Mesoscale Discussion 1835
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0339 PM CDT Tue Jul 29 2025

Areas affected...Northeastern Nevada into southwestern Oregon

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 292039Z - 292245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Strong to isolated severe thunderstorm wind gusts are
possible across portions of northeast Nevada into southwest Oregon
with dry thunderstorm outflow. Weather watch issuance is not
anticipated.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorm development ongoing in a deeply-mixed, dry
boundary layer will result in some chances of strong to severe
thunderstorm wind gusts. With LCL heights at 3.5km and low-level RH
well below 20%, evaporative cooling within downdrafts will result in
gusty thunderstorm outflow. The greatest chance for strong to severe
winds will be along the leading edge of any outflow boundaries.

Mesoscale Discussion 1834
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0259 PM CDT Tue Jul 29 2025

Areas affected...parts of southwest into central Nebraska

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 291959Z - 292200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Strongest thunderstorm development may become focused
across parts of southwestern into central Nebraska through 4-7 PM
CDT.  This may include a few evolving supercell structures posing a
risk for large hail, locally damaging wind gusts and perhaps a brief
tornado.

DISCUSSION...Within lee surface troughing across much of western
Kansas and adjacent portions of the high plains, a strongly heating
(including surface temperatures approaching 100 F) and increasingly
deeply mixed boundary layer is becoming characterized by moderate
CAPE based on latest objective analysis.  Mid-level inhibition is
gradually eroding and deepening convective development is evident,
including the initiation of scattered thunderstorm activity.  As a
weak mid-level perturbation shifts east of the Front Range, models
suggest that thunderstorm development may increase either side of a
remnant frontal zone within the lee surface trough, which is
forecast to slowly shift southeast of the high plains through early
evening.  

Near the nose of the stronger pre-frontal heating, now developing
north and east of the McCook NE vicinity toward areas between North
Platte and Kearney, surface dew points in the lower 70s F are
contributing to moderate to large CAPE along an initially stalled
segment of the frontal zone, where low-level convergence may
eventually focus strongest thunderstorm development.  Although wind
fields in lower through mid-levels are rather weak, easterly
near-surface flow veering to northerly near the eastward migrating
frontal wave (beneath southerly mid-level flow) may contribute to
sufficient shear for intensifying supercell structures posing a risk
for severe hail and perhaps a brief tornado.  Otherwise, storms,
particularly those forming in the strongly heated pre-frontal
environment, may pose a risk for locally strong to severe surface
gusts.

Mesoscale Discussion 1833
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0233 PM CDT Tue Jul 29 2025

Areas affected...Northwest Wyoming into southern Montana

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 291933Z - 292130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...A severe thunderstorm watch may be needed this afternoon
across portions of northern Wyoming into southern Montana in
anticipation of severe thunderstorms capable of large hail and
damaging wind gusts.

DISCUSSION...Convective initiation is well underway across portions
of Yellowstone National Park into southern/central Montana, with
storms anticipated to move off the higher terrain and into the
better buoyancy this afternoon. MLCAPE at or exceeding 1000 J/kg,
combined with 30-40 kts of deep layer shear is expected to support
organized thunderstorms capable of large hail and damaging winds. 

Current SPC surface objective mesoanalysis shows Significant Hail
Parameter values of 1.5-2.0 across portions of southeastern Montana.
RAP/HRRR forecast profiles over the next few hours in the vicinity
of northern Wyoming into Montana corroborate this with steep
low-level lapse rates and strong deep-layer shear. Depending on the
location, low-level wind profiles vary from straight-line (favoring
supercell splits), to cyclonically curved (favoring right supercell
motions). Either scenario will support a large hail threat,
including significant (2.00+ inch) hail with the most robust,
isolated thunderstorms. The steep low-level lapse rates, coupled
with higher LCL heights/dryer boundary layer profiles in the
deeply-mixed air will also support a severe wind threat that will be
maximized with any bowing outflow segments. 

A severe thunderstorm watch may be needed within the next few hours.

Tropical Storm Keli Discussion Number   6
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP022025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 AM HST Tue Jul 29 2025
 
Keli is a ragged-looking tropical storm.  Thunderstorms have been 
developing in the eastern semicircle of the the circulation 
suggesting some decrease in the southeasterly shear.  Satellite 
intensity estimates from PHFO and JTWC were T2.5 and T2.0, 
respectively, and the initial intensity will be held at 35 kt.  Keli 
is a small tropical cyclone and tropical-storm-force winds only 
extend outward from the center about 30 n mi.

The storm appears to be gradually accelerating and is moving 
westward at 13 kt.  A narrow ridge to the north should continue to 
steer Keli westward through the next day or so.  The track guidance 
envelope has shifted northward and increased in forward speed this 
cycle. Thus, the official track forecast has been nudged poleward 
and is slightly faster, lying between the previous forecast and the 
various consensus aids.

Only minimal changes have been made to the intensity forecast.  
Atmospheric conditions and the storm's proximity to Hurricane 
Iona are expected to gradually weaken Keli.  Model guidance has been 
advancing the dissipation of this small storm, and the official 
forecast now shows Keli opening into a trough by 48 h.  However, 
dissipation could still occur sooner than expected.

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM HST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Iona was located
near latitude 10.9 North, longitude 155.7 West. Iona is moving
toward the west near 14 mph (22 km/h) and this general motion with 
some increase in forward speed is expected during the next few 
days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 125 mph (205 km/h) with higher
gusts. Iona is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale. Some additional strengthening is possible
today, but steady weakening is expected to begin by Wednesday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles
(150 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 957 mb (28.26 inches).

Hurricane Iona Discussion Number  11
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 AM HST Tue Jul 29 2025
 
 
After rapidly intensifying over the past day or so, Iona's strength 
appears to have leveled off. The eye of the hurricane is not quite 
as distinct as it was a few hours ago and the convective pattern is 
slightly less symmetric.  The initial intensity is held at 110 kt, 
but this is near the high end of the latest satellite intensity 
estimates. Although Iona is quite powerful, its wind field remains 
compact. The hurricane- and tropical-storm-force wind radii are 
estimated to only extend up to 25 n mi and 80 n mi from the center, 
respectively.
 
The major hurricane is likely near its peak intensity. Water vapor 
images show a large area of dry and likely stable air just west of 
the system, and this stable air combined with increasing shear 
should cause Iona to steadily weaken during the next several days. 
The new forecast is a touch lower than the previous one and lies 
generally near the middle of the guidance envelope.
 
Iona has been moving due westward at about 12 kt on the south side 
of a narrow mid-level ridge situated across the Hawaiian Islands. 
The hurricane should continue westward on the south side of the 
ridge during the next few days, and then turn west-northwestward to 
northwestward after that when it moves toward the southwestern 
periphery of the high pressure system.  The models are again a 
little slower this cycle, and the new track forecast has been 
adjusted in that direction. Iona is expected to cross the 
International Date Line in about 4 days.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 556
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
230 PM MDT Tue Jul 29 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Southern Montana
  Central and Northern Wyoming

* Effective this Tuesday afternoon and evening from 230 PM until
  900 PM MDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 80
    mph possible
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2.5
    inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Scattered thunderstorms are forecast to develop and
intensify through the afternoon and persist into the early to mid
evening.  A few supercells may evolve from the stronger
thunderstorms during the afternoon.  Upscale growth into one or two
small clusters is expected.  Large to very large hail will
potentially accompany any supercell that develops, and severe gusts
(60-80 mph) are possible with the more intense downdrafts and
outflow.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 105
statute miles east and west of a line from 50 miles east northeast
of Harlowton MT to 45 miles east southeast of Lander WY. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU6).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 70 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
24025.

...Smith

Hurricane Iona Discussion Number   9
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 PM HST Mon Jul 28 2025
 
Iona has a very impressive satellite presentation this evening, with 
very cold cloud tops ranging from -70°C to -80°C surrounding the 
well-defined eye.  Subjective Dvorak current intensity estimates 
came in at 5.0/90 knots from PHFO and 5.5/102 knots from SAB.  The 
ADT and AiDT objective intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS have ranged 
between 97 and 104 knots over the past several hours. Based on a 
blend of these data, the initial intensity for this advisory has 
been increased to 100 knots, making Iona a Category 3 major
hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale.
 
Iona is moving due west, or 270 degrees at 11 knots. This general 
motion, along with a gradual increase in forward speed, is expected 
to continue over the next several days as the cyclone moves along 
the southern periphery of a subtropical ridge to the north.  A turn 
toward the west-northwest is anticipated by late in the week as the 
system is influenced by a weakness in the mid-level ridge, created 
by a developing upper-level low west of the International Date Line. 
The official track forecast remains near the center of the guidance 
envelope and is nearly identical to the previous advisory.  
Confidence remains high that Iona will stay well south of the 
Hawaiian Islands.
 
Environmental conditions appear conducive for further 
intensification during the next 12 hours or so, as Iona will remain 
over warm sea surface temperatures near 28C, with sufficient 
mid-level moisture and minimal vertical wind shear.  Given the 
conducive environment, the intensity forecast calls for Iona to 
reach category 4 status later tonight or early Tuesday.  Steady 
weakening is forecast to begin Tuesday night or Wednesday and 
continue into the weekend, as the system moves over slightly cooler 
waters, encounters increasing westerly vertical wind shear, and 
begins to entrain drier mid-level air.  The intensity forecast has 
been adjusted slightly upward from the previous advisory, reflecting 
the latest trends in the intensity guidance.  This aligns well with 
regional hurricane models during the next 24 to 36 hours, and then 
lies near or slightly below the intensity guidance envelope 
thereafter.

Tropical Storm Keli Discussion Number   4
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP022025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 PM HST Mon Jul 28 2025
  
Keli has not changed much this evening, with an area of deep 
convection to the west of the low-level center. The system is 
struggling to become better organized due to vertical wind shear. 
The subjective Dvorak satellite intensity estimates were T2.0 from 
both PHFO and JTWC. Using these estimates and satellite trends, the 
intensity is held at 35 kt for this advisory. Keli is a small 
tropical cyclone and tropical-storm-force winds only extend outward 
about 30 n mi from the center.
  
The storm is moving westward, with an estimated motion of 280/10 kt. 
Keli is forecast to continue moving generally westward for the next 
few days steered by a mid-level ridge north of the system.  The 
official track forecast is similar to the previous, although with a 
slightly faster forward motion.
 
Keli is forecast to remain over warm sea surface temperatures, but 
wind shear is forecast to increase later today, thus the official 
intensity forecast shows little change in intensity during the next 
day or so. As Keli continues to feel the upper-level outflow of 
nearby Hurricane Iona the system should begin to weaken by 36 h, and 
dissipate by Day 3. The official intensity forecast lies near the 
simple and corrected consensus aids. Global models indicate that the 
shear could take its toll on Keli quicker than forecast, and due to 
the small storm size it is possible that the system could dissipate 
into a trough earlier then officially forecast.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 552
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
345 PM CDT Mon Jul 28 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Extreme west central Minnesota
  Northern Nebraska
  Central and eastern South Dakota

* Effective this Monday afternoon and evening from 345 PM until
  1000 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Widespread damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 90
    mph likely
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2.5
    inches in diameter likely
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Initial severe storm development is underway across south
central South Dakota, where supercells with isolated very large hail
up to 2.5 inches in diameter will be possible, as well as an
isolated tornado or two with storms near the front closer to Huron. 
Eventual upscale growth into one or more clusters is expected, with
an increasing threat for swaths of damaging winds (potentially up to
80-90 mph) with any bowing segments.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 75
statute miles north and south of a line from 50 miles north
northwest of Valentine NE to 20 miles southeast of Brookings SD. For
a complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU2).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 551...

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 80 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 650. Mean storm motion vector
26030.

Mesoscale Discussion 1824
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0247 PM CDT Mon Jul 28 2025

Areas affected...parts of south central and southeastern South
Dakota...adjacent north central Nebraska

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 281947Z - 282145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered, intensifying thunderstorm development, posing a
risk for a few strong downbursts and perhaps some hail, appears
possible by 4-6 PM CDT.  Timing of a potential severe weather watch
issuance remains unclear, but trends are being monitored for this
possibility.

DISCUSSION...A surface cold front, now advancing south of Pierre,
Philip and Rapid City is becoming better defined, with strengthening
differential heating along and ahead of it, centered near the
western South Dakota/Nebraska state border northeastward across the
Winner toward Huron vicinities.  While temperatures are approaching
100 F within the corridor of stronger boundary-layer heating,
surface dew points have been slower to mix below 70F, and through
the 60s F, than suggested by model forecast soundings at Winner and
Valentine.  Even so, latest objective analysis suggests that the
pre- and post-cold frontal boundary layer remains strongly capped
beneath the warm and elevated mixed-layer air as far north as the
North/South Dakota state border vicinity.

Mid/upper support for sustained boundary-layer based convection
anytime soon remains unclear, although it appears possible that a
subtle perturbation progressing across and east-northeast of the
Black Hills is contributing to ongoing attempts at convective
development.  It appears more probable that with further insolation,
continued heating and deeper mixing within the pre-frontal
boundary-layer may eventually support intensifying, high-based
thunderstorm development late this afternoon.  In the presence of
strong deep-layer shear, this activity could pose a risk for severe
hail and increasing potential for strong downbursts into early
evening.

Hurricane Iona Discussion Number   7
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 AM HST Mon Jul 28 2025
 
After rapidly strengthening overnight, the cloud pattern and
overall structure of Iona has changed little during the past 6
hours.  A fairly symmetric Central Dense Overcast is seen over the
center in geostationary satellite imagery, but there has been no
recent microwave data to examine the inner core structure. The
latest subjective satellite intensity estimates are T4.0/65 kt
from SAB, and T3.5/55 kt from both PHFO and JTWC.  Objective
estimates remain lower, although it is possible that the small size 
of the cyclone is making it difficult for those techniques to 
capture the true intensity.  The initial intensity for this advisory 
will remain 65 kt, in line with the higher subjective estimate from 
SAB.
 
Iona is located within a low-shear environment and over sea surface
temperatures of around 28C.  Those conditions favor strengthening,
however some nearby dry mid-level air may have been entrained in 
the circulation which likely caused the recent pause in
intensification.  Given the favorable upper-air pattern and warm 
sea surface temperatures, additional strengthening appears likely.  
The regional hurricane models are more aggressive this cycle and 
indicate that Iona could be near or at major hurricane strength in 
a day or so.  As a result, the lastest official forecast calls 
for rapid strengthening during the next 24 hours and the peak 
intensity is raised slightly from the previous advisory.  Around 
midweek, slightly lower SSTs and an increase in vertical
wind shear are expected to cause gradual weakening through the
remainder of the forecast period.  The updated NHC intensity 
forecast is close to the regional models through 24 hours, and then 
follows the latest multi-model (IVCN) consensus aid after that time.
 
Iona is moving westward or 270 degrees at 9 kt.  The storm is
forecast to move along the southern portion of a subtropical ridge
that is well established over the central Pacific.  This steering
pattern should take the storm westward during the next day or so,
followed by a faster west-northwestward motion after midweek. The
updated track forecast is once again near the center of the model
envelope, close to the various consensus aids.  Confidence remains
high that Iona will stay well south of the Hawaiian Islands.

Tropical Storm Keli Discussion Number   2
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP022025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 AM HST Mon Jul 28 2025

ASCAT data from around 1830 Z showed a small area of 
tropical-storm-force winds just north of the center of the system.  
Based on that data, the depression has been upgraded to Tropical 
storm Keli with maximum winds of about 35 kt. Although the winds 
are estimated to be higher than earlier this morning, satellite 
images indicate that the deep convection has generally decreased 
during the past few hours. Keli is a very compact storm with its 
associated cloud field extending only about 90 n mi across. 
 
The storm is moving westward at about 9 kt. Keli is expected to 
continue westward, following Iona, during the next few days as it 
remains on the south side of a narrow mid-level ridge. The latest 
track models have trended a little to the north and are faster this 
cycle, and the official forecast has been nudged in those 
directions.
 
The environmental conditions could favor a little more strengthening 
during the next day or so while the storm is over relatively warm 
water, embedded in a moist air mass, and in generally moderate 
shear conditions. By the middle of the week, however, Iona's outflow 
will likely impinge on the cyclone. These unfavorable upper-level 
winds and stable air should end the opportunity for strengthening 
and cause weakening. Most of the models show Keli dissipating in 
about 2 days, except for the GFS which hangs on to the cyclone for 
about 3 days. Based on the latest guidance, the official forecast 
has moved up dissipation by 24 hours.

Mesoscale Discussion 1821
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0721 AM CDT Mon Jul 28 2025

Areas affected...parts of western/central ND

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 281221Z - 281415Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...A persistent supercell or two may yield a confined swath
of large hail and strong gusts into late morning. Monitoring for
possible Severe Thunderstorm Watch issuance.

DISCUSSION...A couple elevated supercells are ongoing across
southwest/west-central ND, along and just north of I-94. Despite a
lack of reported severe thus far, strong westerly speed shear above
3 km (now sampled by the BIS VWP and 12Z observed sounding) has
sustained persistent organizational structures as these cells spread
across the MT/ND border. This elevated activity is likely to persist
into midday along the buoyancy gradient across western ND. Large
hail and strong gusts should be the primary hazards. Severe wind may
increase if flanking convection can form along the outflow into a
destabilizing airmass over SD. But ongoing low clouds/fog in the
swath of richest low-level moisture casts uncertainty on whether
that scenario may occur soon or later today.

Tropical Storm Iona Discussion Number   5
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 PM HST Sun Jul 27 2025
 
The satellite presentation of Iona has improved this evening, with a
well-defined curved banding structure and excellent upper-level
outflow evident in all quadrants. A recent 28/0650Z Metop-C ASCAT
pass showed a few wind barbs near 40 knots. The latest subjective
Dvorak current intensity estimates came in at 3.0/45 knots from
PHFO, 3.0/45 knots from SAB, and 2.5/35 knots from JTWC. Objective
intensity estimates ranged from 42 to 49 knots. Taking a blend of
these data, the initial intensity for this advisory has been raised
to 45 knots, which may still be slightly conservative.
 
Tropical Storm Iona is moving westward at 270 degrees/10 knots. This
general motion is expected to continue over the next several days as
the cyclone moves along the southern periphery of a subtropical
ridge to the north. A gradual increase in forward speed is also
expected, due to a strengthening low- to mid-level ridge north of
the system. The track forecast remains closely aligned with a blend
of the FSSE, HCCA, and GFEX consensus guidance and is nearly
unchanged from the previous advisory. Confidence remains high that
Iona will stay well south of the Hawaiian Islands.
 
The environment appears conducive for further intensification over
the next day or so, as Iona remains over warm waters near 28C, with
adequate mid-level moisture and very light vertical wind shear. In
fact, the latest GFS and ECMWF SHIPS guidance indicates more than a
30 percent chance of a 25-knot increase in intensity over the next
24 hours. Given the current structure and favorable conditions, the
intensity forecast explicitly calls for rapid intensification during
the next 24 hours, with Iona expected to become a hurricane late
Monday or Monday night. Iona should reach peak intensity Monday
night or Tuesday, with steady weakening anticipated beginning
Tuesday night, as the system moves over slightly cooler waters,
begins to experience increasing westerly vertical wind shear, and
starts to entrain drier mid-level air. The cyclone is expected to
become a post-tropical remnant low by Day 5 and could potentially
weaken into a trough by that time. The intensity forecast has been
raised from the previous advisory to reflect the latest trends in
the guidance, and is best aligned with the FSSE and IVCN consensus
solutions.

Tropical Depression One-C Discussion Number   3
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 AM HST Sun Jul 27 2025
 
The system continues to become better organized this morning, with 
deep convection in curved banding generally to the west of the 
center. Recent imagery shows that convection has been developing the 
last few hours near the low-level center, with some increased 
curvature. Subjective Dvorak satellite intensity estimates from HFO 
and SAB were T/2.0 this cycle. A scatterometer pass is expected 
shortly which should give a better idea of the surface winds. Using 
the Dvorak estimates, the intensity is held at 30 kt.
 
The system is moving westward at about 270/10 kt. A westward motion 
is expected the next several days as the cyclone moves on the south 
side of a mid-level ridge. There continues to be some spread in the 
along track guidance, although there is high confidence on the 
system remaining well south of the Hawaiian islands. The NHC track 
forecast is similar to the previous, and lies closest to the HCCA 
corrected consensus aids.
 
Environmental conditions appear favorable for some gradual 
strengthening the next couple of days. The hurricane regional models 
remain at the higher end of the guidance envelope, and the latest 
NHC forecast is near the previous. Beyond 48 h, a gradual weakening 
trend should begin as the system moves over slightly cooler sea 
surface temperatures, a drier airmass, and vertical wind shear is 
expected to increase. The gradual weakening trend will cause the 
system to become a remnant low by day 5, potentially even opening 
into a trough.

0257 PM CDT Sun Jul 27 2025

Areas affected...central/eastern North Carolina...southern Virginia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 271957Z - 272200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered thunderstorm activity will promote a few
instances of strong to severe wind this afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Scattered thunderstorm activity has increased in
coverage across portions of eastern North Carolina this afternoon.
The air mass in this region is very hot and unstable, but deep layer
shear for a more organized severe threat remains weak. Given the
deep moisture and strong instability, a few wet downbursts may
produce some instances of strong to severe wind. Overall, this
threat will remain too isolated for watch issuance.

Tropical Depression One-C Discussion Number   1
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 PM HST Sat Jul 26 2025

Deep convection has persisted over the area of low pressure well 
southeast of the Hawaiian Islands for the last 12 hours or so, with 
the latest satellite images showing improved organization and a 
better defined banding structure.  The latest subjective Dvorak 
current intensity estimates came in at 2.0/30 knots from PHFO, 
1.5/25 knots from SAB, and 1.0/25 knots from JTWC.  A recent 
27/0620Z Metop-B ASCAT pass showed a well-defined low-level 
circulation with a large swath of 25-knot winds and a few embedded 
25- to 30-knot wind barbs.  Given the improved structure and 
organization of the system, advisories are being initiated on the 
first tropical cyclone of the season in the central Pacific, 
Tropical Depression One-C.  The initial intensity will be set at 30 
knots.

Tropical Depression One-C is moving toward the west, or 270 degrees, 
at 10 knots.  This general westward motion is expected to continue 
over the next couple of days as the system moves along the southern 
periphery of a subtropical ridge to the north.  Beyond 48 hours, the 
forward speed is expected to increase considerably in response to a 
low- to mid-level ridge strengthening to the north of cyclone.  The 
track forecast closely follows a blend of the TVCE and HCCA 
consensus guidance.

The environment will remain conducive for intensification over the 
next couple of days, as One-C remains over warm waters between 28 
and 29C, with adequate mid-level moisture and light to moderate 
easterly shear.  As a result, the intensity forecast calls for 
steady strengthening during this time, with One-C becoming Tropical 
Storm Iona on Sunday.  Beyond 60 hours, the cyclone will begin to 
experience increasing westerly vertical wind shear while also 
entraining drier mid-level air.  This is expected to lead to steady 
weakening, with the system becoming a tropical depression again 
around day 5.  The intensity forecast is best aligned with the HCCA 
intensity consensus guidance.
