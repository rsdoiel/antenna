SUMMARY...A cluster of storms will move southeastward across the
region this morning with wind damage possible.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 65
statute miles north and south of a line from 65 miles west northwest
of Springfield IL to 35 miles east of Mattoon IL. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU8).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 576...WW 577...

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
1.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A

Mesoscale Discussion 1763
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0956 AM CDT Wed Jul 31 2024

Areas affected...central Indiana

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 311456Z - 311630Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Locally gusty winds of 40-60 mph are possible across parts
of central Indiana through early afternoon. Severe thunderstorm
watch issuance is uncertain.

DISCUSSION...A cluster of storms near the IL/IN border will continue
to track east/southeast the next few hours. Overall structure and
organization of this activity has decreased compared to
overnight/earlier this morning. Measured wind gusts with this
activity have mostly been in the 30-40 kt range, with a couple
locally higher gusts. The downstream environment remains weakly to
moderately capped with deep-layer flow relatively weak (less than 30
kt effective shear). With continued heating, inhibition should
gradually decrease. However, instability and shear are expected to
remain somewhat modest. While some minor intensification is
possible, timing and coverage of any greater severe risk is
uncertain. Severe thunderstorm watch issuance is not expected in the
short term, but trends will be monitored and watch issuance is
possible later this morning or afternoon if trends increase
sufficiently.

Tropical Depression Three-E Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032024
800 AM MST Wed Jul 31 2024
 
Over the last few hours, the convective organization has improved 
with the area of low pressure we have been monitoring a few hundred 
miles off the southwestern coast of Mexico. First-light visible 
imagery from a GOES-West meso-sector over the storm show the 
development of organized curve banding, with low-level cloud motions 
also now suggesting the presence of closed cyclonic flow. This 
improved convective structure was also seen in an earlier 1040 UTC 
SSMIS microwave pass. In addition, the latest set of subjective 
Dvorak intensity estimates were both at T2.5/35 kt from both SAB and 
TAFB. All these data suggest that the system has become a tropical 
cyclone, and advisories are being initiated at this time. The 
initial intensity for this advisory is set at 30 kt, a little under 
the Dvorak estimates given the lower objective estimates and 
earlier scatterometer data.
 
The initial estimated motion is off to the west-northwest at 
295/12-kt. This motion is expected to continue with a gentle 
turn more westward over the next few days as the system becomes 
primarily steered by a deep-layer ridge located over the 
southwestern United States. Towards the end of the forecast period, 
there could be a bit more of a weakness in this ridge on its 
western extent, potentially allowing the system to turn more 
poleward again. The initial track forecast in general sticks close 
to the consensus aids TVCE and HCCA, which favor a track that is in 
between the operational GFS and ECMWF tracks, but slightly in favor 
of the latter.
 
Intensity-wise, TD3-E might be our first system in the East Pacific 
to last longer than a couple of days, with most of the guidance 
suggesting intensification into the weekend. SHIPS guidance from 
both the GFS and ECMWF suggest the shear will remain low (less than 
15 kt) while sea-surface temperatures underneath the cyclone remain 
in the 29-30 C range over the next few days. Such a favorable 
environment could favor significant intensification once an 
inner-core becomes established. Interestingly, the 
regional-hurricane model guidance, while showing intensification, do 
not currently forecast rapid intensification. The first NHC 
intensity forecast shows more gradual intensification for the next 
day or so, followed by a somewhat faster rate, peaking the system as 
a Category 1 hurricane in 72 h, on the high end of the intensity 
guidance.  Towards the end of the forecast, the tropical cyclone 
should begin to move over cooler ocean waters, with gradual 
weakening expected to begin around day 4 or 5.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0759 AM CDT Wed Jul 31 2024

Valid 311300Z - 011200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
MIDDLE MISSOURI VALLEY AND UPPER MIDWEST...

...SUMMARY...
Another active severe-weather day is expected from the
northern/central Plains and Upper Midwest to the southern
Appalachians. This includes potential for large hail across parts of
the northern/central Plains, aside from a more prevalent risk of
damaging winds, some of which could be significantly strong.

...Great Plains/Mid-Missouri and Mid-Mississippi Valleys...
A relatively prominent summertime mid-level trough is readily
apparent across the northern High Plains early this morning, and
will reach the Upper Midwest tonight. Ahead of this trough,
scattered occasionally strong/locally severe convection has occurred
overnight across northern South Dakota into southern/eastern North
Dakota. This convection should further increase into midday/early
afternoon, with a more appreciable severe risk evolving across
north-central/eastern South Dakota, and eventually into southwest
Minnesota by mid/late afternoon. Some initial supercells capable of
very large hail will be possible, but storm mergers within a very
unstable environment by mid/late afternoon should lead to MCS
development and heightened wind potential. 

Additional potentially intense storm development is expected
southwestward near the cold front into Nebraska and Kansas, with
large hail and severe-wind gusts expected. One or more organized
clusters should regionally evolve by early/mid-evening across the
Siouxland and far eastern Nebraska into much of Iowa. Potentially
significant wind gusts in excess of 75 mph are plausible given the
steep lapse rate environment and reservoir of strong to extreme
buoyancy. Severe-MCS persistence seems viable tonight across much of
Iowa/southern Minnesota, possibly northern Missouri, and Illinois.

...Central Plains/southern High Plains...
Isolated to scattered thunderstorms are expected to develop along
and ahead of the front. Deep-layer shear will be strong enough for
an isolated severe threat. Large to very large hail will be possible
with supercells in parts of central Kansas. However, the environment
will be less favorable further southwest with more of an
isolated/marginal overall severe threat expected across southwest
Kansas into northwest Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle.

...Lower Ohio Valley/Cumberland Plateau/Southern Appalachians...
Similar to yesterday, a seasonally strong belt of northwesterly flow
aloft will persist today from the lower Ohio Valley to the southern
Appalachians and coastal Southeast. Much of this will reside atop a
moist and very unstable air mass, especially across parts of the
lower Ohio Valley to Cumberland Plateau, where upwards of 3000-4000
J/kg MLCAPE may develop by peak heating outside of any MCS-related
impacts. This general scenario will likely support several organized
severe-producing storms clusters/MCSs through the evening across
these regions. Somewhat higher severe probabilities (Enhanced
category) may be warranted in subsequent outlooks for parts of these
region.

For one, an MCS ongoing across central Illinois this morning may
potentially persist southeastward within this increasingly unstable
environment, possibly impacting areas such as southern Indiana,
southern Ohio and parts of Kentucky/Tennessee with a heightened wind
damage potential. Aided by differential heating, scattered storms
should also increase across the southern Appalachians vicinity this
afternoon, with some organization into clusters possible given the
aforementioned relative strength of winds aloft, with wind damage
possible.

...Southern Arizona...
An upper low near Baja and ongoing early day storms across parts of
northwest Mexico may influence thunderstorm development this
afternoon within a moist air mass particularly across southeast
Arizona. Some of the storms could produce severe-caliber wind gusts
and blowing dust this afternoon into early evening.

Mesoscale Discussion 1743
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1139 AM CDT Tue Jul 30 2024

Areas affected...Pennsylvania...Maryland...and Virginia...including
Washington D.C.

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 301639Z - 301845Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Initially isolated thunderstorms should increase in
coverage through the afternoon hours with an accompanying increase
in damaging wind potential. Watch issuance is not anticipated given
a weak kinematic environment.

DISCUSSION...GOES imagery and lightning data over the past 30-60
minutes have shown steadily deepening/intensifying convection along
a residual outflow boundary and weak surface trough from central PA
southward into VA. While ongoing convection currently appears to be
sub-severe based on MRMS hail metrics and regional velocity data,
temperatures warming into the low 80s should promote SBCAPE values
up to 2000 J/kg that will likely result in additional thunderstorm
development as well as some degree of intensification through the
day with an attendant potential for damaging wind gusts. Given weak
deep-layer flow over the region, overall convective intensity will
likely be influenced primarily by low-level heating/destabilization.
This will be modulated by how quickly residual low-level stratus can
clear ahead of developing storms. If stronger diurnal heating can be
achieved (i.e. surface temperatures into the mid/upper 80s) then
higher SBCAPE (possibly up to 3000 J/kg) and steeper low-level lapse
rates will likely favor more intense convection with a relatively
higher damaging wind threat. Regardless, watch issuance is not
anticipated given the meager deep-layer wind shear and uncertainty
regarding the thermodynamic environment.

1130 AM CDT Tue Jul 30 2024

Valid 301630Z - 311200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE MID MISSOURI VALLEY INTO THE MID MISSISSIPPI VALLEY/MIDWEST...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE NORTHERN PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are expected today into tonight across a broad
area from eastern Nebraska and Iowa into parts of the Midwest,
Tennessee Valley and southern Appalachians, with multiple swaths of
damaging winds likely within this corridor. Severe thunderstorms are
also possible across parts of the northern Plains.

...Mid Missouri Valley into the Midwest/Ohio Valley/Southeast...
A larger than usual amount of uncertainty remains regarding
convective evolution this afternoon though tonight. Ongoing cluster
in southern IA will move southeastward across the mid MS Valley into
a rapidly destabilizing airmass with enhanced northwesterly winds at
mid/upper-levels supporting sufficient deep-layer shear for
continued updraft organization. A swath of severe/damaging winds
appears likely with this cluster given the favorable parameter
space. Therefore, the Enhanced Risk for damaging winds has been
extended southeastward to account for the forecast evolution of this
MCS. Another ongoing cluster over the lower OH Valley should also
pose some threat for severe/damaging winds as it and associated
outflow on its southwest flank spreads east-southeastward across KY
and perhaps parts of TN the rest of this afternoon/evening.

Additional robust thunderstorm development appears possible through
the period in a broad corridor from central/eastern NE through the
lower OH Valley and Southeast, with swaths of damaging winds likely
the main threat. Details on where/when this activity will develop
remain rather uncertain. But, isolated supercells may develop across
central/eastern NE late this afternoon/evening in the vicinity of a
surface low/lee trough. Very large hail may occur with this
convection, with a greater threat for severe/damaging winds possible
if this activity can grow upscale into another cluster and spread
southeastward across the mid MO and mid MS Valleys this
evening/overnight.

...Northern Plains...
Weak mid-level height falls amid moderate to strong instability
should foster to widely scattered thunderstorm development along a
surface trough/dryline across parts of the Dakotas this afternoon.
Moderate mid-level westerlies should support deep-layer shear around
30-35 kt, sufficient for a few organized storms, including a few
supercells, capable of both large hail and damaging gusts this
afternoon and evening.

...Mid-Atlantic Vicinity...
A weak mid/upper-level trough and will move across the
Mid-Atlantic and vicinity through this evening. Scattered
thunderstorm development should continue this afternoon from VA into
parts of PA. While there is some uncertainty regarding the extent of
heating and destabilization due to lingering cloudiness, a couple of
stronger cells/clusters may become capable of producing isolated
damaging winds.

...Northeast...
Weak to locally moderate instability may develop this afternoon from
parts of northern New York into northern New England. While storm
coverage remains uncertain, deep-layer shear and relatively cool
temperatures aloft could support a couple of modestly organized
thunderstorms capable of locally damaging winds, and possibly some
hail.

Valid 301700Z - 311200Z

The current forecast remains on-track with no necessary updates or
changes. See previous discussion for further detail.

..Halbert/Squitieri.. 07/30/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0138 AM CDT Tue Jul 30 2024/

...Synopsis...
A midlevel trough will move eastward across the northern Rockies and
adjacent Plains during the day. Along/south of the trough, moderate
west-southwesterly midlevel flow will overspread the Great Basin
into the northern/central Rockies.

...Dry Thunderstorms - Northern Rockies/Intermountain West...
Large-scale ascent accompanying the midlevel trough will promote
widely scattered thunderstorms across portions of ID and western MT
during the afternoon and evening. While 0.6-0.9 inch PW will favor a
mix of wet/dry thunderstorms, 25-35 mph storm motions may tend to
limit overall rainfall in any given area. Nevertheless,
lightning-induced ignitions will be possible on the peripheries of
rain cores, given dry fuels across the area.

...Dry/Windy - Great Basin into the Central Rockies...
Deep boundary-layer mixing into the enhanced flow aloft will yield
5-10 percent RH and 15-20 mph sustained west-southwesterly surface
winds from southern UT into WY -- with the strongest winds expected
over WY. These dry/breezy conditions atop modestly receptive fuels
will favor elevated fire-weather conditions during the afternoon.

Mesoscale Discussion 1742
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0909 AM CDT Tue Jul 30 2024

Areas affected...portions of southern Illinois and southern Indiana
into north-central Kentucky

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 567...

Valid 301409Z - 301615Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 567
continues.

SUMMARY...Severe thunderstorms posing a damaging wind risk will
persist across southern Illinois within Severe Thunderstorm Watch
567. Areas across southern Indiana into adjacent north-central
Kentucky are being monitored for possible downstream watch issuance.

DISCUSSION...A small, but well organized bowing cluster of storms
continues to track east/southeast across south-central Illinois this
morning. This activity has produced gusts near 50 kt within the past
hour. Around 30 kt effective shear magnitudes are likely sustaining
organized activity as convection shifts east/southeast along an
instability gradient oriented northwest to southeast across the
lower Ohio Valley vicinity. A very moist downstream airmass is
evident, with surface dewpoints in the 70s. With continued heating,
boundary-layer inhibition is expected to quickly erode by midday.
Damaging gusts may continue downstream of ongoing activity,
especially if additional convection can develop on the southern
flank of the ongoing cluster. Visible satellite imagery shows
deepening cumulus ahead of the southern flank, so this evolution
appears plausible. A downstream watch may be needed within the next
hour or so if current trends persist/increase.

Mesoscale Discussion 1741
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0847 AM CDT Tue Jul 30 2024

Areas affected...portions of southern Iowa...northern Missouri...and
extreme west-central Illinois

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 301347Z - 301515Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Damaging gusts are possible this morning and afternoon as
a cluster of storms tracks southeast across southern Iowa into
northern Missouri and extreme west-central Illinois. A watch may be
needed this morning, though timing is uncertain.

DISCUSSION...A well organized cluster of storms currently moving
into central Iowa has produced gusts near 50 kt within the past 30
minutes or so. This activity may be somewhat elevated in the wake of
overnight convection. Nevertheless, 35-45 kt effective shear
magnitudes and MLCAPE around 1000-1500 J/kg will likely maintain
organization. While outflow from overnight convection has surged
southward to near I-70 in Missouri, the airmass has shown signs of
quick recovery, with surface dewpoints in the mid/upper 60s F noted
in 13z surface obs. Clear skies ahead of the cluster will also allow
for quick heating through the morning hours. As a result, downstream
destabilization and erosion of capping is expected. 

The ongoing cluster of storms may continue to gradually intensify
and pose a risk for damaging gusts into late morning/early afternoon
as the downstream airmass continue to recover/destabilize. Given the
effect of overnight convection on the airmass, there is some
uncertainty in convective evolution and timing of possible watch
issuance. Nevertheless, it appears possible a severe thunderstorm
watch could be needed this morning across parts of the discussion
area.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0158 AM CDT Mon Jul 29 2024

Valid 301200Z - 311200Z

...Synopsis...
A midlevel trough will advance eastward across the northern Rockies
and adjacent High Plains during the day, while broad/enhanced
west-southwesterly flow aloft persists across the Great Basin.

...Northern Rockies/Intermountain West... 
Large-scale ascent accompanying the eastward-moving midlevel trough
will promote widely scattered thunderstorms across portions of the
northern Rockies/Intermountain West into the northern Plains during
the afternoon and evening. While many of these storms will be
capable of producing measurable rainfall, quick eastward-moving
storms (around 25-35 mph) will still favor a mix of wet/dry
thunderstorms over dry fuels. As a result, some lightning-induced
ignitions will be possible -- especially along the peripheries of
any rain cores.

...Great Basin...
Boundary-layer mixing into the modestly enhanced west-southwesterly
flow aloft will lead to locally dry/breezy conditions across parts
of the Great Basin during the afternoon. While locally elevated
conditions are possible, winds should be slightly weaker than the
day prior, and the overall threat appears too localized for an
Elevated area at this time.
