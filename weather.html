Mesoscale Discussion 0454
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0349 PM CDT Wed Apr 16 2025

Areas affected...parts of swrn into s cntrl KS

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 162049Z - 162315Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...An isolated supercell or two may evolve from initially
high-based thunderstorm development by 6-7 PM CDT, posing primarily
a risk for severe hail and locally strong surface gusts.

DISCUSSION...As boundary-layer heating and mixing continues,
deepening high-based convective development is ongoing in a corridor
near/north of the Raton Mesa vicinity into southwestern Kansas. 
This appears focused downstream of a weak mid-level perturbation,
which is progressing toward the crest of large-scale mid-level
ridging across the southern Rockies through southern Great Plains. 
With continuing insolation, this convective development is likely to
persist and gradually spread northeastward and eastward with the
supporting large-scale forcing for ascent.  

Strongest boundary-layer heating appears focused northwest of the
Dalhart TX toward Dodge City KS vicinity, where surface dew points
remain in the upper 30s to lower 40s F.  However, more substantive
moistening is ongoing farther east, including a corridor across the
Medicine Lodge toward Great Bend KS vicinities, where dew points may
continue to increase into and through the lower mid 50s F, as
southerly low-level flow strengthens through 23-00Z.  It appears
that this may contribute mixed-layer CAPE increasing to the order of
1000 J/kg.

In the presence of lower/mid-tropospheric warm advection, the
boundary-layer destabilization may largely remain suppressed by
warming, elevated mixed-layer air.  However, the eventual
intensification of initially high-based convection overspreading the
region appears at least possible later this afternoon, particularly
near/east of the Dodge City vicinity, aided by inflow of the
potentially more unstable air.  If this becomes sustained, shear
beneath moderate to strong westerly mid/upper flow appears more than
sufficient to support the evolution an isolated boundary-layer based
supercell or two, primarily posing a risk for severe hail and
locally strong surface gusts.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS LATE THIS
AFTERNOON INTO TONIGHT FROM THE TEXAS PANHANDLE TO NORTHEAST KANSAS
AND VICINITY...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated large hail and strong-severe outflow gusts are possible
this evening into tonight from parts of the southern and central
Plains into the lower to mid Missouri Valley.

...Discussion...
The forecast is on track, and no change is needed to the previous
outlook.

..Smith.. 04/16/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1116 AM CDT Wed Apr 16 2025/

...TX Panhandle to northeast KS and vicinity through tonight...
Upper ridging that currently extends from the southern Plains into
eastern Manitoba/northwest Ontario is forecast to shift eastward
throughout the period. This eastward shift will occur as a shortwave
trough drops south-southeastward through the Pacific
Northwest/northern Rockies, phasing with the upper low off the
southern/central CA Coast as it does. This evolution will result in
strengthening southwesterly flow aloft from the Southwest into the
central Plains, which in turn will foster a deepening lee surface
trough across the High Plains and eventual surface cyclogenesis over
the central High Plains. 

Moisture return will also increase across the southern Plains, with
upper 50s/low 60s dewpoints likely across much of OK by this
evening. Some thunderstorm development could occur during the late
afternoon/early evening where the western edge of this moisture
interacts with a dryline that extends south from the developing
central High Plains surface low. Convergence along this boundary
will be modest and convective initiation remains uncertain given the
warm mid-level temperatures and resultant capping. Even so, an
isolated storm or two appears possible from southwest KS into the
eastern TX Panhandle. Strong mid-level flow (and resulting long
hodographs) support a supercellular storm mode with any convection
that is also to deepen and persist. Large hail and damaging gusts
would be possible with any supercells.

Higher thunderstorm coverage is anticipated later tonight as the
surface low and any afternoon storms move eastward across
southwest/south-central KS into the greater low-level moisture, and
a strengthening low-level jet fosters increased warm-air advection. 
Hail will likely be the primary risk with these storms, but the dry
subcloud layer in place could still support a few gusts to the
surface as well. Overall severe coverage is still expected to remain
low enough to keep 5%/Marginal probabilities.

Valid 171200Z - 181200Z

...EXTREMELY CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHWESTERN...CENTRAL
AND NORTHEASTERN NEW MEXICO...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHEASTERN ARIZONA INTO PARTS OF
THE SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

A significant fire weather threat is still expected across portions
of the Southwest and central High Plains Thursday. Strong mid-level
flow over a very dry boundary layer will promote southwest surface
winds of 30-40 mph amid relative humidity values of 5-10 percent
during the afternoon across southwestern into northeastern New
Mexico. Latest model guidance and increasing ensemble probabilities
of significant fire weather threat across the area prompted an
southwest to northeast elongation of the Extreme highlights across
New Mexico. Higher confidence exists for enhanced downslope drying
and associated stronger winds via lee cyclone development for
Critical fire weather conditions across southeastern Colorado
resulting in a slight northward expansion of Critical highlights
into this area.

..Williams/Moore.. 04/16/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0159 AM CDT Wed Apr 16 2025/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough will continue its slow progression eastward on
Thursday. Mid-level winds will increase and peak during the
afternoon in New Mexico. A deep surface low will develop in eastern
Colorado into western Kansas. A cold front will move southward into
the central Plains by late afternoon.

...New Mexico...
A significant fire weather event is expected across much of New
Mexico. Strong surface winds of 25-40 mph appear likely,
particularly in portions of central and northeastern New Mexico.
Wind gusts with the mid-level jet overhead will approach 50-60 mph.
ERC data shows much of this region at or above the 90th percentile
due to ongoing severe drought. A swath of 5-10% RH is also probable
during the afternoon. These conditions will promote extreme fire
behavior should any ignitions occur.

...Southern High Plains...
RH values near 10% are expected to extend into parts of eastern
Colorado, western/central Kansas, and the Texas/Oklahoma Panhandles.
Strong winds of 20-30 mph are also expected. The strongest winds are
expected from the northwest Texas/Oklahoma Panhandles into southeast
Colorado and far southwest Kansas. Strong downslope winds will
extend into parts of the central Front Range. Critical fire weather
will occur where the strongest winds overlap with sufficiently dry
fuels. The critical highlights have been kept out of parts of the
Texas Panhandle/South Plains where greenup will mitigate fuel
receptiveness. Elsewhere, elevated to critical fire weather can be
expect for several hours. The northern extent of the greatest fire
weather risk will be delineated by the southward moving cold front.
Some areas of northeast Colorado into northwest Kansas will see
elevated to briefly critical conditions before winds shift to the
north and RH rises.

0216 PM CDT Wed Apr 16 2025

Valid 181200Z - 191200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM THE CENTRAL
GREAT LAKES TO THE SOUTHERN GREAT PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are possible from the central Great
Lakes to the southern Great Plains, mainly during the late afternoon
Friday into Friday night.

...Synopsis...
Within a broad open wave trough, a swath of increasing southwesterly
flow aloft will overspread the southern Rockies and extend into the
southern and central Plains. At the surface, a front will extend
roughly from western Oklahoma northward to Wisconsin, with a surface
low tracking eastward to the Great Lakes region. A secondary area of
cyclogenesis is expected to develop across the Texas/Oklahoma
panhandles through the period. Scattered thunderstorms development
is expected along the front from the southern Great Plains to the
Great Lakes region.

...Central Great Lakes to the Southern Great Plains...
An area of elevated thunderstorms will likely be ongoing across the
northern portion of the outlook area. These will pose some lingering
risk of severe hail early. 

Additional thunderstorm development is expected through the
afternoon and evening along the cold front. This development will be
delayed by a pronounced EML and MLCIN along and ahead of the
boundary. As a secondary low establishes across the Oklahoma/Texas
Panhandles, thunderstorm development will likely occur along the
dryline across the Southern Plains. As the cold front sags
southwards and upper-level cooling and forcing overspreads the
boundary, additional scattered thunderstorm development is expected
to continue northward into the Great Lakes region. Shear profiles
are largely boundary parallel, which would favor training and
clustering of thunderstorms through time. Given broad region of
favorable MLCAPE and deep layer shear, storms will be capable of
large hail and damaging winds. Early more discrete storm modes
across southern Oklahoma/north Texas on the edge of a plume of steep
low to mid-level lapse rates may promote a conditional risk of very
large hail early on.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PORTIONS OF
THE EASTERN CENTRAL PLAINS AND UPPER MIDWEST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated to scattered severe thunderstorms are possible, mainly from
late afternoon Thursday into the evening, across parts of the
eastern Central Plains to the Upper Midwest. Large to very large
hail and localized damaging winds are the primary risks.

...Synopsis...
A broad open wave trough will extend from the western Canada into
the Northern Rockies and Great Basin on Thursday, with broad
southwesterly flow extending from the Southwest through the
central/northern Plains. A surface cyclone is expected to develop
across western Kansas, with a diffuse frontal boundary extending
southwest to northeast across the Central Plains into the Midwest.
The triple point near the low/dryline/front interface is expected to
be the focus point for convective development by the afternoon and
evening from eastern Nebraska to Iowa and into Minnesota.

...Eastern Central Plains into the Upper Midwest...
As the low develops across western Kansas late Wednesday into
Thursday, southerly return flow will bring moisture northward into
the central Plains. Afternoon thunderstorm development is expected
as differential heating is maximized along a frontal boundary across
eastern Nebraska Thursday afternoon. This region will be
characterized by dew points in the 50s to 60s, with MLCAPE around
1500-2500 J/kg by the afternoon amid a plume of steep low to
mid-level lapse rates. While MLCIN is expected to increase across
portions of Iowa, a corridor of open warm sector is expected to
develop across eastern Nebraska where wind profiles will support
supercells. These supercells may be initially surface based, capable
of large hail (some very large 2"+), damaging wind, and perhaps a
tornado. Boundary parallel flow will likely lead to some
undercutting of storms as well as storm motions that favor training
cells, which will likely limit the tornado threat into the evening
while potential for large hail and damaging wind continues with
eastward extent.

A few surface based cells may develop as far north as southwestern
Minnesota. Moisture profiles are less favorable this far northward
but convergence along the front/surface trough along with favorable
wind profiles will support some risk for large hail, damaging wind,
and perhaps a tornado.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR EASTERN ARIZONA INTO NEW MEXICO
INTO SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

Latest model guidance and surface observations supported an eastward
expansion of Elevated highlights farther into Nebraska. Minimal
boundary layer moisture and persistent westerly flow will keep
relative humidity rather low (10-20% range) through the day coupled
with breezy west winds, supporting Elevated fire weather conditions
across southeastern Wyoming and western Nebraska. Otherwise,
forecast remains on track across the Southwest and adjacent southern
High Plains with a broad area of Elevated to Critical fire weather
concerns in place.

..Williams/Moore.. 04/16/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0157 AM CDT Wed Apr 16 2025/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough will evolve from an upper low off the southern
California coast today. This will drive increasing mid-level winds
across much of the Southwest. East of the Divide, surface lee
troughing will increase through the day.

...Eastern Arizona into New Mexico into southern High Plains...
The strongest mid-level winds will not arrive until the evening, but
moderate flow will be ongoing during the afternoon. Coupled with the
lee trough to the east, 15-25 mph winds are possible across a broad
portion of the Southwest into the southern High Plains. The
strongest winds are expected in eastern Arizona and New Mexico. RH
of 10-15% (locally 5-10%) in these areas will promote a critical
fire weather threat.

...Central High Plains...
With an extension of the lee trough into western Nebraska and
eastern Wyoming, a zone of 15-20 mph downslope winds will develop
during the afternoon. RH of 10-20% appears possible. Elevated fire
weather is expected this afternoon.

...Mid-Missouri Valley...
Southerly/southeasterly winds will reach 15-20 mph during the late
morning to mid-afternoon. Model variance in terms of the RH during
the afternoon is large. This is likely due to uncertainty in the
amount of surface heating with mid/upper-level clouds in the region.
Fuels will at least support a locally elevated fire weather threat.

Isolated large hail and strong-severe outflow gusts are possible

...TX Panhandle to northeast KS and vicinity through tonight...
Upper ridging that currently extends from the southern Plains into

trough across the High Plains and eventual surface cyclogenesis over
the central High Plains. 

Moisture return will also increase across the southern Plains, with
upper 50s/low 60s dewpoints likely across much of OK by this
evening. Some thunderstorm development could occur during the late
afternoon/early evening where the western edge of this moisture
interacts with a dryline that extends south from the developing

...SUMMARY...
Isolated large hail and strong-severe outflow gusts are possible
this evening into tonight from parts of the southern and central
Plains into the lower to mid Missouri Valley.

...TX Panhandle to northeast KS and vicinity through tonight...
Midlevel ridging will shift slowly eastward from the Great Plains to
the MS Valley by tonight, as a midlevel trough digs southward toward
the northern Great Basin and begins to phase with a closed low off
the CA coast.  This pattern will favor west-southwesterly flow over
the Rockies and lee cyclogenesis across the central High Plains. 
Northward advection of a modifying Gulf air mass will occur from TX
to KS, beneath an elevated mixed layer.  Thunderstorm development
will become possible late this afternoon/evening from the TX
Panhandle into southwest KS, where surface heating and sufficiently
deep mixing occur along the developing dryline.  MLCAPE of 1000-1500
J/kg and long hodographs will favor high-based supercells capable of
producing isolated large hail and strong-severe outflow gusts. 
Confidence in diurnal storm development is modest, but storms that
form (especially across KS) could persist/spread eastward overnight
with a strengthening low-level jet and associated warm advection.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0351 AM CDT Wed Apr 16 2025

Valid 191200Z - 241200Z

...DISCUSSION...
Severe potential remains apparent into the weekend, but
predictability wanes substantially by D5/Sunday. 

...D4/Saturday...
The persistent longwave trough is expected to breakdown as an
embedded northern-stream shortwave impulse accelerates east across
ON/QC and the basal shortwave impulse moves more gradually east into
the southern High Plains. Through Saturday afternoon, an expansive
swath of strong mid-level flow will persist from the central
Appalachians southwestward into the southern Great Plains. The
nearly stalled baroclinic zone from TX/OK into the Lower OH Valley
will likely be modulated by ongoing convection on Saturday morning.
But with appreciable boundary-layer heating of a seasonably moist
air mass to the south-southeast, scattered severe storms are
plausible from the Upper OH Valley through central TX. 

...D5/Sunday...
The 00Z GFS and related GEFS are substantially different relative to
24 hours ago with the evolution of the compact shortwave trough
ejecting across the southern Great Plains and the attendant synoptic
cyclone. Most other guidance has remained relatively consistent to
prior days with probable cyclogenesis from OK to the Lower MO
Valley. This would result in a confined belt of strong mid-level
southwesterlies overlapping a broad warm sector with rich western
Gulf moisture. Potentially extensive convection in parts of OK/TX on
Sunday morning does complicate exactly how far north-northwest
appreciable destabilization may occur into the Ozarks/Lower MO
Valley and beyond. Overall setup outside of the GFS-based guidance
appears to support scattered severe storms across the South-Central
States on Sunday afternoon/evening.

Mesoscale Discussion 0447
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0110 PM CDT Mon Apr 14 2025

Areas affected...parts of cntrl/sern SD...swrn MN...nern IA...nern
NE

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 141810Z - 142115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Showers spreading southeastward through the mid Missouri
Valley may begin to intensify by 3-4 PM CDT, with a few weak
thunderstorms developing and posing increasing potential for strong
to severe surface gusts while spreading southeastward through the
remainder of the afternoon.

DISCUSSION...In the wake of a deep cyclone, now migrating northeast
of the Upper Great Lakes region, downward mixing of momentum is
already contributing to 30-35+ kt northwesterly surface gusts across
much of the middle Missouri Valley, as boundary-layer warming
progresses.  This is occurring just ahead of a vigorous short wave
trough now digging through the western Dakotas, and forecast to
continue rapidly southeastward through early evening.  

Models indicate that the mid-level cold core (including -30 to -35C
around 500 mb) will overspread a corridor from central South Dakota
through northeastern Iowa between 20-23Z, coincident with further
strengthening of northwesterly flow (35-40+ kt) in the 850-700 mb
layer and peak afternoon surface heating.  As this occurs, forecast
soundings indicate that profiles will become increasingly conducive
to deepening convection capable of producing lightning. 

With at least some further intensification of ongoing developing
convection, evaporative cooling and melting of precipitation within
an increasing well-mixed boundary layer (characterized by sizable
surface temperature/dew point spreads on the order of 20+ F),
coupled with the downward mixing of stronger flow aloft, seems
likely to contribute to increasing potential for surface gusts
approaching or briefly exceeding severe limits.  This may continue
into early evening, as convection spreads southeastward, before
rapidly diminishing with the onset of boundary-layer cooling.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 138
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
325 PM EDT Mon Apr 14 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Central and Eastern Kentucky
  Southern Ohio
  Far Southwestern Pennsylvania
  Southwestern Virginia
  West Virginia

* Effective this Monday afternoon and evening from 325 PM until
  1100 PM EDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph likely
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2
    inches in diameter possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms coverage is expected to increase over the
next few hours along and ahead of a cold front pushing eastward
across the region. Environmental conditions support strong to severe
storms. An initially cellular mode will favor large hail and
damaging gusts before a transition to a more linear storm mode
favors primarily damaging gusts.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 80
statute miles north and south of a line from 30 miles west of
Lexington KY to 60 miles north northeast of White Sulphur Springs
WV. For a complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch
outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU8).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
24040.

...Mosier
