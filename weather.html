0610 AM CST Sun Mar 02 2025

Valid 021300Z - 031200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON AND
EVENING ACROSS PORTIONS OF WESTERN OKLAHOMA AND THE EASTERN TEXAS
PANHANDLE....

...SUMMARY...
Isolated strong to severe storms are possible from western North
Texas into western Oklahoma this afternoon and early evening. Large
hail and strong/marginally severe winds, and a couple tornadoes are
the primary hazards.

...Western OK and Vicinity...
a compact and progressive upper low is tracking eastward this
morning across southern NM, along with an accompanying 90-100 knot
mid-level jet max. Large scale upper divergence and lift ahead of
the low will likely result in scattered thunderstorm activity by
mid-morning across west TX.  This activity will spread eastward
through the day into western OK, with a low-end threat of hail in
the strongest storms.

In the wake of the morning activity, relatively strong heating is
expected to the east of the Caprock, where temperatures will climb
well into the 70s behind the dryline.  A narrow corridor of modest
CAPE (1000-1500 J/kg) should develop along the dryline during the
peak heating period.  Most CAM solutions suggest isolated convective
initiation by 21-23z as the primary upper jet max noses into the
region.  Forecast soundings show very steep mid-level lapse rates
and strong deep-layer shear, favorable for supercells capable of
large hail.  Low-level shear profiles will be quite strong, but
winds in the 3-5km layer exhibit a veer-back-veer pattern that may
disrupt discrete storm modes.  Nevertheless, a couple tornadoes are
also possible.

The primary severe threat is expected to remain focused across
western OK and northwest TX where the best thermodynamic parameters
are forecast.  However, storms will spread eastward through the
evening into central/southern OK and north TX with a continued
isolated severe hail/wind threat.

...EXTREMELY CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF EASTERN NEW
MEXICO INTO FAR WESTERN TEXAS...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR MUCH OF NEW MEXICO INTO
SOUTHEASTERN COLORADO...THE OKLAHOMA PANHANDLE...AND WESTERN
TEXAS...

...Synopsis...
The second and larger in a series of mid-level troughs will traverse
the Southern Rockies tomorrow (Monday), encouraging rapid surface
low development along the High Plains. Behind a trailing surface
dryline, widespread dry and windy conditions will prevail for
several hours Monday afternoon, promoting dangerous wildfire-spread
potential. Widespread 20+ mph sustained west-southwesterly surface
winds amid 10-15 percent RH will become common across much of New
Mexico into southeastern Colorado and western Texas, necessitating
the introduction of broad Elevated/Critical highlights. However,
deterministic and ensemble guidance consensus (including
high-resolution members) depict a belt of 30-40 mph sustained
west-southwesterly surface winds coinciding with 5-10 percent RH for
at least a few hours across portions of eastern New Mexico into Far
West Texas. In this area, fuel receptiveness is approaching critical
thresholds, and when considering the intense winds with very low RH,
at least localized to potentially widespread extreme wildfire-spread
behavior is possible, with Extremely Critical highlights introduced.

Multiple rounds of thunderstorms are expected to develop across the
southern Plains Sunday into Monday. The southwestern most extent of
these storms may occur across portions of western Texas into
Oklahoma, which may temper wildfire-spread concerns in the
northeastern portions of the Elevated and Critical highlights. As
such, these particular highlights may need considerable adjustments
in later outlooks.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0322 PM CST Sat Mar 01 2025

Valid 031200Z - 091200Z

Fire weather concerns are expected to remain very active through
much of next week with a progressive pattern resulting in a series
of strong mid/upper-level troughs moving across the southern U.S.
Meanwhile, the persistent dry conditions across the southern High
Plains will continue to promote further drying of fuels, with
critically dry fuels expected over a broad area. Multiple days of
very strong winds, very low minimum RH values, and critically
receptive fuels are expected. Higher-end critical conditions - with
significant fire potential - appear probable on Day 3/Monday and Day
4/Tuesday.

...Southern Plains: Day 3/Monday - Day 4/Tuesday and Day 6/Thursday
- Day 7/Friday...
A large mid-level trough is forecast to rapidly deepen over the Four
Corners on Day 3/Monday as strong mid-level flow overspreads a warm
and dry low-level airmass across the Southern Plains. In response,
an area of rapidly developing lee cyclogenesis is expected across
portions of CO/KS, which will tighten the surface pressure gradient.
The combination of very strong surface winds, very low minimum RH,
and critically receptive fuels (including locally heavy herbaceous
fuel loading) will promote higher-end and potentially significant
fire weather conditions - especially across portions of New Mexico
and far western Texas. 

Higher-end critical fire weather conditions (with significant fire
weather potential) will also be possible Day 4/Tuesday across
portions of Texas as the aforementioned surface low moves eastward.
The primary uncertainty remains the eastward extent of the fire
weather threat, which may be modulated somewhat by wetting rainfall
ahead of the system. 

After a brief break from large-scale fire weather conditions across
the southern High Plains Day 5/Wednesday, fire weather conditions
are forecast to return Day 6/Thursday through at least Day 7/Friday
as another mid-level trough moves across the southern U.S. Enough
run-to-run and inter-model consistency exists to introduce 40%
probabilities for Critical conditions both Day 6/Thursday (in a dry
return flow pattern) and Day 7/Friday (behind a dryline/frontal
passage), where the most favorable overlap of strong winds, low RH,
and receptive fuel is currently expected. 

...Eastern US: Day 5/Wednesday - Day 6/Thursday...
Local fire weather conditions are possible Day 5/Wednesday and Day
6/Thursday across portions of the Southeast U.S., as dry/breezy
conditions occur behind a cold frontal passage. However, at this
time, confidence for any critical fire weather risk is low due to
precipitation potential ahead of the front perhaps reducing fuel
receptiveness.

Valid 021200Z - 031200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR THE EASTERN
TEXAS PANHANDLE...WESTERN OKLAHOMA...PARTS OF SOUTHWEST KANSAS...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated strong to severe storms are possible from western North
Texas into northwest Oklahoma and adjacent southwest Kansas on
Sunday. Large hail and strong/marginally severe winds are the
primary hazards.

...Synopsis...
A compact upper low currently in the lower Colorado Valley will
eject into the southern High Plains by early afternoon on Sunday. A
modest surface low will develop in response to this feature and will
generally track through the Texas Panhandle into western/central
Oklahoma. Moisture return on the western flank of the surface high
to the east will be relatively weak. However, with 50s F dewpoints
in portions of Central Texas, it is possible that mid/upper 40s F
could return into the Texas Panhandle/western Oklahoma vicinity
during the afternoon.

...Eastern Texas Panhandle into western Oklahoma Vicinity...
With the approach of the compact shortwave trough, some elevated
showers and embedded thunderstorms are possible Sunday morning. This
activity will move northeastward and may persist into the early/mid
afternoon in some areas. The primary severe risk will be associated
with the surface low and whatever destabilization is able to occur
in the wake of the early activity. As mentioned, moisture will be
rather modest. Compensating for this, however, will be very cold
temperatures aloft (-20 to -22 C in the core of the upper
low/trough). At lest a narrow band of buoyancy is expected to
develop in the eastern Texas Panhandle and far western Oklahoma. A
strong mid-level jet on the southern/eastern flank of the upper
trough will promote at least marginal supercell structures capable
of large hail and strong/marginally severe winds. Storms are more
likely to be elevated farther north into Kansas and east into
central Oklahoma. Even so, small to marginally severe hail and
isolated strong gusts would be possible in the strongest storms.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF SOUTHEAST ARIZONA INTO
FAR SOUTHWESTERN NEW MEXICO...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF WESTERN NORTH AND
SOUTH CAROLINA...

...Mid-Atlantic/Southeast...
Latest high-resolution ensemble guidance continues to suggest a
large area of elevated to near-critical fire weather conditions in
the lee of the Appalachians and across the Southeast this afternoon.
A very dry airmass has settled across the region in the wake of a
dry cold front, with current surface observations indicating
dewpoints between 25-35F. Highs near 70F today will support several
hours of critical minimum RH values near 20-30% amidst receptive
fuels and breezy downslope west/southwesterly surface winds. At this
time, the best overlap of stronger surface winds (sustained winds
near 20 mph and wind gusts 20-30 mph) and critical fuels appears to
be across portions of western North and South Carolina, where a
Critical fire weather area has been introduced. The Elevated area
was also expanded farther across portions of the Northeast, along
the Appalachians, and across the Southeast. 

...Southwest...
Latest water vapor imagery shows an upper low over portions of 
southern CA, which is forecast to move eastward into southwest AZ by
this evening. As this occurs, strong mid-level flow is expected to
overspread portions of the Desert Southwest. The latest surface
observations suggest a very dry airmass is in place, with critical
RH values already being observed. Strong/gusty surface winds are
expected to develop over the next few hours, as a surface cyclone
strengthens across the Lower Colorado River Basin. Higher-end
critical fire weather conditions are possible across portions of
Southern Arizona, where sustained winds near 30 mph and minimum RH
values less than 10% are expected for a few hours this afternoon.  

Please see the previous discussion below for more information.

..Elliott.. 03/01/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0148 AM CST Sat Mar 01 2025/

...Synopsis...
A pronounced mid-level trough will traverse the Desert Southwest as
a larger-scale upper trough amplifies along the East Coast today. A
surface cyclone will develop over the Lower Colorado River Basin,
while a surface trough and accompanying cold front sweep across the
Eastern Seaboard into the Southeast during the afternoon,
encouraging dry and windy conditions across both meteorological
regimes. Across the Lower Colorado River Basin, 20+ mph sustained
southerly surface winds will coincide with 10-15 percent RH for at
least a few hours around peak heating, warranting the maintenance of
Critical highlights given drying fuels. Likewise, fuels continue to
dry from Virginia to Alabama, where the passage of the surface lee
trough/cold front will support 15+ mph sustained southwesterly
surface winds, that should shift to a northwesterly direction with
time. RH will dip to at least 30 percent over several locales from
the Mid Atlantic to the Southeast, where fuels remain receptive to
wildfire spread and where Elevated highlights remain in place.

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms appear unlikely through tonight.

...Synopsis and Discussion...
12Z observed soundings, recent surface observations, and
satellite-based precipitable water estimates across AZ show very
little moisture present this morning. A closed upper low over
southern CA and northern Baja California will continue to advance
eastward across the Southwest through the period. While strong
large-scale ascent and cold mid-level temperatures will accompany
this feature, nearly all guidance shows a lack of even weak
instability until later this evening, mainly on the
subsident/backside of the upper low. While showers should eventually
move across parts of AZ late this evening and overnight, the
potential for thunderstorms appears less than 10% due to the very
limited low-level moisture and instability forecast. Elsewhere,
thunderstorms are not expected across the remainder of the CONUS
through tonight.

...DISCUSSION...
Medium-range guidance suggests that an initially zonal, intense
mid/upper jet across the western into central mid-latitude Pacific
may undergo considerable amplification into and through this period.
It remains a bit unclear how emerging waves will impact the
downstream pattern by the middle to latter portion of next week. 

However, it still appears that one significant preceding short wave
trough, migrating inland of the Pacific coast by early Monday, will
progress into and across the southern Rockies, before accelerating
east-northeastward through mid week.  And guidance remains
suggestive that this will be accompanied by strong surface
cyclogenesis, perhaps most notably across portions of the east
central Great Plains toward the lower Great Lakes region late
Tuesday through Tuesday night.  This may include an evolving warm
sector with intensifying low-level and deep-layer shear (in the
presence of southerly to southwesterly flow strengthening to 50-100
kt in the 850 to 500 mb layer), coincident with an influx of
moistening and destabilizing boundary-layer air off the northwestern
Gulf.  

Spread typical at this extended time frame (day 5) lingers among the
various model output concerning the sub-synoptic, and even synoptic,
details across the southeastern Great Plains through Ohio Valley and
Southeast, which may considerably impact the severe weather risk
area and potential.  However, the medium-range guidance depicts an
environment at least conditionally supportive of an organized severe
weather event, including potential for a few strong tornadoes and
damaging straight line winds.

It is possible, but perhaps a bit more uncertain, that this could
continue across parts of the southern and middle Atlantic Seaboard
on Wednesday.

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms are not expected across the CONUS on Tuesday.

...Synopsis...
After an upper-level trough moves of the eastern Florida coast,
generally quasi-zonal flow will prevail across the CONUS. Two
shortwaves, one in central/northern Rockies and the other in
Mid-Atlantic, will have little in terms of moisture to work with.
Thunderstorm potential with these features will be quite low. Very
isolated thunderstorm activity could linger into early Tuesday
morning in Florida, but the departing shortwave/surface low will not
synoptically favor coverage at or above 10%.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0117 PM CST Sun Feb 23 2025

Valid 232000Z - 241200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms should continue across portions of Louisiana and
immediate surrounding areas today. Additional isolated thunderstorms
may still occur in portions of Oregon/Washington. No severe weather
is expected.

...20Z Update...
The primary change made to the 20Z Day 1 Convective Outlook was to
trim western portions of the general thunder delineation over
Coastal TX. Low-level moisture advection and associated buoyancy is
translating east along the Gulf Coast in tandem with a mid-level
trough. As such, additional lightning flashes are most likely across
portions of LA into central/southern MS and adjacent waters. A few
lightning flashes still remain possible across portions of the
Pacific Northwest with the approach of a mid-level trough.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1012 AM CST Sun Feb 23 2025/

...TX/LA...
A prominent shortwave trough is tracking eastward across TX today,
providing lift and destabilization to parts of southeast TX and LA. 
Scattered thunderstorms have been occurring in this region through
the morning, but should slowly shift offshore by later this
afternoon as the upper system passes.  While small hail could occur
with the strongest onshore storms, no severe weather is anticipated.


...WA/OR...
Recent water vapor loop shows a strong shortwave trough approaching
the Pacific Northwest coast.  As this system approaches,
strengthening onshore flow and cold temperatures aloft will increase
the risk of at least isolated thunderstorms - mainly this evening.
