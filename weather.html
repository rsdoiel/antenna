Weather Outlook<br>NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br>945 AM EDT
Wed Sep 11 2024<br><br>For the North Atlantic…Caribbean Sea and the Gulf
of Mexico:<br><br>Special Outlook issued to update the system in the
eastern Tropical <br>Atlantic west-southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands
(AL93).<br><br>Active Systems:<br>The National Hurricane Center is
issuing advisories on Hurricane <br>Francine, located over the western
Gulf of Mexico a couple hundred <br>miles off the coast of Louisiana.
<br><br>1. Eastern and Central Tropical Atlantic (AL93):<br>Updated:
Recent satellite-wind data indicates that the system <br>located a few
hundred miles to the west-southwest of the Cabo Verde <br>Islands has
developed a well-defined circulation. In addition, <br>showers and
thunderstorms continue to show signs of organization, <br>and if these
trends continue, advisories will be issued on a <br>tropical depression
later this morning. The system is moving to the <br>west-northwest at 10
to 15 mph and will be moving into the central <br>Tropical Atlantic by
the end of the week.<br>* Formation chance through 48 hours…high…90
percent.<br>* Formation chance through 7 days…high…90 percent.<br><br />
2. Central Tropical Atlantic (AL92): <br>An elongated area of low
pressure located over the central tropical <br>Atlantic continues to
produce some disorganized shower and <br>thunderstorm activity.
Environmental conditions appear marginally <br>conducive for some slight
development during the next day or two <br>while the system moves
westward at 5 to 10 mph over the central <br>tropical Atlantic. The
disturbance is expected to reach an area of <br>stronger upper-level
winds on Thursday, likely ending its chances <br>for development.<br>*
Formation chance through 48 hours…low…30 percent. <br>* Formation chance
through 7 days…low…30 percent.<br><br /> 3. East of the Leeward Islands
(AL94):<br>A small but well-defined area of low pressure located several
<br>hundred miles to the east of the Leeward Islands is producing an
<br>area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms. The proximity of dry
<br>air near the system is expected to limit additional development over
<br>the next couple of days before environmental conditions become even
<br>less conducive by this weekend as it moves slowly
<br>west-northwestward. <br>* Formation chance through 48 hours…low…10
percent. <br>* Formation chance through 7 days…low…10 percent.<br><br />
4. Offshore the Southeastern U.S. over the Western Atlantic:<br>In a few
days, a non-tropical area of low pressure could form along <br>a
residual frontal boundary a few hundred miles off the southeastern
<br>U.S. coastline. Thereafter, some subtropical or tropical development
<br>is possible during the early part of next week as the system
<br>meanders over the Gulf Stream or drifts slowly northward.<br>*
Formation chance through 48 hours…low…near 0 percent. <br>* Formation
chance through 7 days…low…20 percent.<br><br /> <br>Forecaster

Areas affected...southeastern Louisiana coastal areas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 111250Z - 111615Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...The risk for occasional tornadoes may begin to increase
near southeastern Louisiana coastal areas by late morning (10
AM-Noon).  Trends are being monitored for the possibility of a
tornado watch.

DISCUSSION...The center of Francine has been migrating across and
northeast of the Gunnison Oil Platform vicinity of the northwestern
Gulf of Mexico during the past hour or so, and is still roughly 170
miles from its forecast south central Louisiana coastal landfall
later today.  However, the leading edge of a broader convective
precipitation shield preceding Francine is beginning to overspread
coastal areas, accompanied by saturating thermodynamic profiles with
lapse rates trending moist adiabatic in mid-levels.

In the wake of this regime, and with the continued approach of
Francine, model forecast soundings suggest that a subtle increase in
boundary-layer temperatures and dew points may contribute to modest
destabilization by midday along coastal areas from west of
Boothville into the Vermilion Bay vicinity.  It appears that this
will coincide with more notable strengthening of low-level wind
fields, which are forecast to contribute to enlarging low-level
hodographs increasingly supportive of convection with embedded
low-level mesocyclones potentially capable of producing tornadoes.

Valid 111300Z - 121200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS IN THE CENTRAL
GULF COAST VICINITY...

...SUMMARY...
Hurricane Francine poses a tornado threat today and tonight in the
central Gulf Coast vicinity.

...Synopsis...
The midlatitude westerly belt will amplify somewhat in mid/upper
levels, related somewhat to general height rises over the mid/upper
Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes and Northeast.  However, the main
influence will be troughing related to a cyclone now closing off,
just offshore from the Pacific Northwest Coast.  The trough will
move inland today and cross the interior Northwest, reaching an axis
from southern BC across eastern parts of WA/OR to the Sierra south
of RNO by 00Z.  By 12Z, the trough should extend from the
southernmost Canadian Rockies, across westernmost MT, through a
500-mb low over eastern ID, to near LAS, with associated cyclonic
flow covering most of the CONUS west of 100W and north of 35N.

Farther southeast, moisture-channel imagery indicates that a weak,
cut-off, 500-mb low analyzed last night at 00Z over north-central TX
has moved little since.  However, the low is expected to drift/
redevelop northeastward through the period, reaching southeastern OK
by 12Z tomorrow.  In response, and as forecast by NHC, Hurricane
Francine should move inland tonight across southeastern LA, and into
southwestern MS before daybreak tomorrow.

At the surface, 11Z analysis showed a quasistationary front from
northern FL across the shelf waters of the FL Panhandle/AL/MS,
becoming a diffuse warm front over the Mississippi River mouth and
southern Terrebonne Parish, then just offshore again around the
northern/northwestern rim of Francine's circulation.  This boundary
should move slowly northward/inland over the north-central Gulf
Coast through the period, with the decaying center of Francine
likely catching the front inland tonight.  Elsewhere, a lee trough,
with several weak lows attached, was drawn over eastern portions of
MT/WY/CO, and should strengthen today amidst peripheral mass
response to the major mid/upper trough moving into the northwestern
CONUS.

...Gulf Coast:  Hurricane Francine...
Increasing southwesterly deep shear on the cyclone as a whole is
expected, contributing to greater asymmetry in the overall precip/
convective pattern, with increasing supercell/tornado potential
today northeast through east of center.  The threat is expected to
ramp up through the remainder of the morning, from south to north
and west to east along the coast, with the greatest potential still
appearing to be this afternoon into early evening, near and south of
the I-10/I-12 corridor from southeastern LA eastward toward MOB,
then overnight, spreading eastward into some of the western FL
Panhandle.

This should occur as:
1.  Destabilization spreads somewhat inland -- both from theta-e
advection along and south of the warm front, and weak diurnal
heating;
2.  Relatively large low-level hodographs spread over the region
along and south of the warm front -- in the outer parts of the
closed TC circulation; and
3.  Both the greater instability and shear spread into a regime of
developing, discrete to semi-discrete convection in bands that can
organize to supercells.
Overland penetration of the most favorable parameter space will
occur overnight, but should be restricted in extent and magnitude by
abundant inland precip and associated stability, as well as
nocturnal/diabatically driven stability inland.

See SPC Mesoscale Discussion 2051 for near-term assessments.  Refer
to NHC advisories for forecast track, intensity and tropical watch/
warning information on Francine.

...Northern Rockies to northern High Plains...
Two main regimes are expected to contribute to high-based
thunderstorms, atop well-mixed subcloud layers, with marginal
hail/wind potential (western lobe) and mainly strong/isolated severe
gusts (eastern lobe) in the outlook area, with a relative minimum
but non-zero potential for a severe gust in between.

In the western lobe, scattered afternoon thunderstorms in bands and
clusters should develop as low/middle-level destabilization,
combined with modest but adequate moisture, weakens MLCINH and
strengthens buoyancy.  Cooling aloft related to increasing large-
scale lift from DCVA, and in the left-exit region of cyclonically
curved upper-jet segment, will overlie surface heating to steepen
tropospheric lapse rates, with pockets of 250-750 J/kg peak/
preconvective MLCAPE expected to develop.  Though north of the
strongest deep shear, the area still will lie under strong difluence
aloft, and 25-35-kt effective-shear magnitudes contributing to some
organization.

Farther east over the northern High Plains, marginal low-level
moisture, recycled from the last continental/polar air intrusion,
will keep moisture weak (with post-mixing surface dewpoints in the
40s to low 50s F), yet still just enough to support isolated to
widely scattered thunderstorms this afternoon into early evening. 
Activity may be relatively maximized near the intensifying lee
trough, where low-level mass convergence and strong diurnal heating
will combine to eradicate CINH.  Deep subcloud layers with steep
lapse rates will support downdraft accelerations, even with modest
updraft buoyancy (MLCAPE generally 500-1000 J/kg).  A moist axis
near and parallel to the front will yield higher CAPE, but in a more
strongly capped air mass where initiation and maintenance of
surface-based convection is less certain.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0202 AM CDT Tue Sep 10 2024

Valid 111200Z - 121200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE GREAT BASIN...

...Synopsis...
The upper trough over the western US will quickly intensify
Wednesday, as a shortwave perturbation and mid-level jet streak move
onshore over the West Coast. As the trough strengthens, mid-level
flow over much of the West will increase. A surface low will deepen
over the northern Great Basin, while a cold front moves onshore and
also strengthens. To the east, TS Francine will approach the Gulf
Coast with offshore winds likely over parts of the mid South. Strong
surface winds, low humidity, and thunderstorms over parts of the
West and central US will support critical fire-weather concerns
Wednesday.

...Great Basin...
Ahead of the deepening trough, a potent mid-level jet streak will
move over parts of the western Great Basin beginning early
Wednesday. A deepening surface low in parts of the eastern Basin
will drive 20-25 mph winds over much of NV into western UT.
Augmented by downslope flow off the Sierra and the approaching cold
front, a brief period of winds of 25-30 mph will be possible along
with RH below 15%. Widespread critical fire-weather conditions are
likely over parts of the Great Basin. Fire-weather concerns should
diminish behind the front as cooler and more quiescent conditions
are expected behind the front into early Thursday.

...Lee of the Rockies and High Plains...
As the trough approaches, height falls and stronger flow aloft will
overspread the Rockies and High Plains. A surface low will deepen
first in eastern MT, with a lee trough extending south into the
central High Plains. Near the lee trough, strong southerly winds
will overlap with areas of low RH and drying fine fuels. Elevated
fire weather concerns are expected over parts of the High Plains
Wednesday afternoon and evening.

...Mid South...
As Francine approaches the Gulf Coast Wednesday and Wednesday night,
offshore pressure gradients will increase over parts of the lower MS
Valley and Mid South. While humidity values are not expected to be
overly low with the tropical air mass approaching, strong gusts are
expected to overlap with areas of relatively dry fuels and little
recent rainfall. Brief elevated fire-weather conditions are possible
before rain chances increase into early Thursday.

...Northwest Thunder...
Ahead of the cold front, increasing mid-level moisture and strong
lift from the trough will promote scattered thunderstorms Wednesday
afternoon. Lightning may interact with areas of somewhat drier fuels
over parts of the Northwest and northern Rockies before broader
wetting rainfall develops. However, these storms will likely have
higher precipitation efficiency with a cooler air mass and more
plentiful Pacific moisture in place. This lends significant
uncertainty on the threat for any lightning ignitions.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR PARTS OF THE
LA GULF COAST...

...SUMMARY...
Some tornado threat associated with Tropical Cyclone Francine may
approach the Louisiana Gulf Coast by early Wednesday morning.

...Synopsis...
Tropical Storm Francine will potentially intensify into a hurricane
as it moves north-northeastward across the western Gulf of Mexico.
Meanwhile, a strong mid/upper-level shortwave trough is forecast to
dig southeastward into the Pacific Northwest and northern CA.
Diurnal thunderstorms capable of locally gusty winds will be
possible from the eastern Great Basin into parts of the Rockies, and
also across the FL Peninsula. More isolated storms will also be
possible from the central Plains into the parts of the upper
Midwest, which may also be capable of locally gusty winds. Organized
severe-thunderstorm potential is expected to remain low, with the
possible exception of the LA Gulf Coast region late in the period in
association with Francine. 

...LA Gulf Coast vicinity...
Refer to NHC forecasts and advisories for more information regarding
Tropical Storm Francine. Based on the current forecast track, the
most favorable environment for low-topped supercells associated with
Francine should remain offshore for most of the forecast period.
However, some outer bands may begin to approach the LA Gulf Coast
prior to 12Z Wednesday morning, accompanied by an increase in
low-level shear/SRH. A small Marginal Risk has been included near
the immediate LA Gulf Coast for the potential of an increasing
tornado threat prior to the end of the forecast period.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0150 AM CDT Mon Sep 09 2024/

...Synopsis...
Broad trouhging over the Northwest should continue today as an
embedded perturbation moves eastward over the northern Rockies.
Southwesterly flow aloft is forecast to increase over much of the
West as the broad trough slowly shifts east. At the surface, a cold
front will move into the Rockies, bringing a cooler air mass to
parts of the Northwest, but gusty winds to parts of the Cascades. A
lee trough developing east of the Rockies will help support isolated
dry thunderstorms over parts of WY and MT. Periods of stronger
surface winds and low RH will support elevated to near-critical
fire-weather conditions.
 
...Northwest and Great Basin....
Stronger flow aloft is expected to persist today over much of the
Northwest and northern Great Basin. Surface winds should increase to
15-25 mph as momentum from aloft mixes down. Downsloping and
mid-level drying should keep the air mass quite dry with diurnal RH
minimums below 15% likely. Several hours of widespread elevated to
near-critical fire-weather conditions are likely across the northern
Sierra and Great Basin.

Farther north, more moderate RH of 25-30% is expected beneath the
upper trough and behind the cold front. Despite the arrival of a
cooler Pacific air mass, downslope winds of 15-25 mph should overlap
with dry fuels and pockets of lower RH during the day. Overlapping
with recent lightning and fire activity, a few hours of elevated to
near-critical conditions are possible in the lee of the Cascades as
winds increase.

...Northern Rockies...
Stronger westerly flow head of the embedded shortwave will aid in
deepening a lee trough east of the Rockies. Westerly surface winds
should strengthen in turn, supporting pockets of downslope winds of
15-25 mph across parts of MT and WY. With hot temperatures and
little recent rainfall, afternoon RH values should remain quite low,
generally below 20%. Increasing winds, receptive fuels, and
persistent dry conditions should support several hours of elevated
to near critical fire-weather conditions over parts of the northern
Rockies.

...Dry Thunder...
Isolated, high-based thunderstorms appear likely over parts of the
Rockies (mainly WY and MT) today ahead of the shortwave trough. Weak
buoyancy, and PWATs of 0.5 to 0.7 inches, atop dry and well-mixed
low levels will support poor precipitation efficiency and the
potential for strong outflow winds. At least isolated storms are
expected over areas of receptive fuels. Thus, dry lightning
ignitions are possible, especially across parts of north-central WY,
where storm coverage appears greatest.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
NEW YORK...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated damaging winds may occur this afternoon across parts of New
York.

...New York...
Within large-scale upper troughing over the Northeast and eastern
Canada, an embedded shortwave trough over southern Ontario and the
upper Great Lakes will continue to move across the Northeast this
afternoon and evening. Ascent associated with this shortwave trough
and related mid-level jet is supporting isolated thunderstorms
across southern Ontario and vicinity. This activity will spread
east-southeastward this afternoon across parts of NY. The airmass
over this region should become only weakly unstable as filtered
daytime heating occurs, with poor mid-level lapse rates, persistent
cloud cover, and modest low-level moisture limiting destabilization.
Still, gradually increasing west-northwesterly winds at low/mid
levels will foster around 25-35 kt of deep-layer shear. This should
support modest thunderstorm organization, with multicells/small
clusters potentially evolving along and downstream of Lake Ontario.
Isolated strong to damaging winds should be the main threat with
this convection as it moves across much of NY this afternoon and
early evening, before eventually weakening with eastward extent with
the loss of daytime heating.

...Northern/Central Rockies and High Plains...
Isolated to widely scattered thunderstorms should develop this
afternoon over portions of the northern/central Rockies as a weak
shortwave trough continues eastward. Low-level moisture and related
instability are both expected to remain rather meager into the High
Plains, which should limit updraft intensities. Still, isolated
strong/gusty winds may occur with this high-based activity across
parts of MT/WY where low-level lapse rates can become steepened.
Greater low-level moisture is present farther east into the Dakotas,
along/east of a weak surface low/trough. But, increasing
low/mid-level temperatures and a strong cap should generally inhibit
thunderstorm development through much of the day with eastward
extent across the northern/central Plains.
