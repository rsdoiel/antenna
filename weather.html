Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0641 PM CST Mon Dec 11 2023

Valid 120100Z - 121200Z

...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms are not expected in the U.S. through tonight.

...DISCUSSION...
An upper-level trough will move eastward across the Northeast
tonight, as west to northwest mid-level flow remains over much of
the remainder of the U.S. At the surface, a large area of high
pressure from the Ohio Valley southwestward into the lower
Mississippi Valley will suppress moisture return. The relatively dry
and cool airmass associated with the high will make thunderstorms
unlikely through tonight.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0326 PM CST Mon Dec 11 2023

Valid 131200Z - 191200Z

Fire weather potential remains low for the extended period. An
expansive surface high will slowly become established over the
central and eastern CONUS in the wake of the mid-level impulse and
attendant surface front currently progressing across the Canadian
Prairies and northern Plains. This unseasonably strong surface high
will modulate winds for much of the country, resulting in low
probability for winds exceeding critical thresholds. Weak winds,
combined with increasing rain chances from the southern High Plains
to the lower MS River Valley during the mid/late week period, will
yield limited fire weather potential outside of the southern CA
coast.

...Southern California...
An offshore flow regime will likely persist D3/Wednesday into
D4/Thursday along the southern CA coast as an upper disturbance
exits the region to the east. However, medium to long-range guidance
continues to suggest mid to upper-level winds will remain fairly
modest on the back side of the upper trough. Consequently, offshore
winds may be driven primarily by surface pressure gradients, which
remain poorly resolved by most guidance at this range (considerable
spread is noted in deterministic/ensemble solutions). Localized fire
weather concerns remain possible, but confidence in critical
conditions remains too low for highlights.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0629 AM CST Mon Dec 11 2023

Valid 111300Z - 121200Z

...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms are not expected in the U.S. through tonight.

...Synopsis/Discussion...
In mid/upper levels, cyclonic flow will remain over the East, but
will lose amplitude in response to two processes:
1.  The eastward ejection of a substantial trough now over the Lower
Great Lakes and Mid-Atlantic region.  The associated low-level cold
front is in the process of clearing the New England Coast, with the
surface-based buoyancy well south of the area, and another couple
hours of 100-300 J/kg MUCAPE largely confined to between the top of
a stable boundary layer and the -20 deg C thermal level.  While a
rogue flash cannot be ruled out around Cape Cod, lightning potential
appears too low and isolated to introduce a general-thunder area. 
2.  Amplification and slow eastward shift of initially weak
troughing now over the Pacific Coast vicinity, reaching interior
OR/western ID, northwestern NV, and east-central/southwestern CA by
the end of the period.  Associated strengthening DCVA/cooling aloft
should remain too displaced from enough elevated moisture to support
a thunderstorm area until day 2.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1254 AM CST Mon Dec 11 2023

Valid 121200Z - 131200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
An upper-level cyclone will be positioned across parts of the
Northeast with a cutoff low developing in the Great Basin in a
quasi-Rex Block pattern. Surface high pressure will continue to be
the predominant feature over much of the CONUS. Fire weather
concerns will likely remain minimal on Tuesday for most areas.
Offshore pressure gradients in southern California will increase
very late Tuesday into Wednesday morning. However, RH recovery
overnight and only marginal increases in the wind should keep fire
weather concerns low through the end of the period.
