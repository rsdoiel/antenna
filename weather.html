Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0743 AM CDT Fri Apr 04 2025

Valid 041300Z - 051200Z

...THERE IS A MODERATE RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM THE
ARKLATEX INTO SOUTHEAST MISSOURI...

...SUMMARY...
Several clusters of severe storms are expected from central Texas
across the ArkLaTex and into the lower Ohio Valley through tonight.
The greatest threat for tornadoes, large hail and damaging winds
will be from the ArkLaTex across western Arkansas into southeast
Missouri, including potential for strong to potentially intense
tornadoes.

...Synopsis...
Early morning satellite imagery shows a deep upper trough extending
across the western CONUS, with an embedded shortwave trough moving
through the southern High Plains. Another embedded shortwave trough
exists farther west and is currently moving across the central Baja
Peninsula. The lead wave is forecast to continue northeastward into
the central Plains throughout the day, while the second wave
continues eastward into northern/central Mexico. 

At the surface, a stalled frontal boundary currently extends from a
weak low near DRT northeastward to another weak low in northeast TX.
Widespread showers and thunderstorms are ongoing north of this
boundary, supported by a warm-air advection from a strong low-level
jet that covers much of central/eastern TX and the Lower MS Valley.
Expectation is for the low-level jet to persist throughout the day,
gradually shifting eastward in response to modest eastward progress
of the upper troughing. Eastern portion of the stationary front
should transition to a warm front while elevated thunderstorms
continue north of this boundary. Northward progression of this front
will allow the very moist airmass in place across east TX and LA to
surge northward into more of the Mid-South/Mid MS Valley, resulting
in a broad and unstable warm sector by early afternoon. At the same
time, the portion of the front over TX will begin drifting
southeastward as a cold front. Severe thunderstorms are expected as
this front interacts with the moist and unstable warm sector in
place.

...Eastern OK into the Mid MS Valley this morning...
Ongoing showers and thunderstorms across eastern OK and
northern/western AR are expected to shift northeastward this
morning, gradually losing intensity as buoyancy weakens with
northern extent. Expectation is for these storms to stay elevated
north of the warm front, but there should still be enough buoyancy
for large hail within the strongest storms.

...Arklatex through the Mid-South this afternoon/evening...
As mentioned in the synopsis, the warm front across the region is
expected to surge quickly northward, with very moist air expected to
advect into the region in its wake. 70s dewpoints are already in
place across east TX and northwest LA and consensus within the
guidance takes these 70s dewpoints into central AR and western TN by
later this afternoon. Modest heating within this airmass will bring
temperatures into the upper 70s/low 80s. These surface conditions
beneath a residual EML will support robust destabilization and a
large area of 2000+ J/kg of MLCAPE. A vigorous low-level jet will
extend across this region as well, resulting in robust low-level
shear. Some mid-level weakness is noted in forecast hodographs, but
the bulk shear is still more than enough to support supercells.

A combination of convergence along the front and strengthening
large-scale ascent is expected to result in initial development
around 18Z from far west-central/southwest OK through the Arklatex
into northeast TX. Given the strong buoyancy and shear, this
development should mature quickly into supercells capable of all
severe hazards, including strong to intense tornadoes and very large
(i.e. greater than 2" in diameter) hail. With the increasing ascent
and little to no convective inhibition, overall storm coverage will
be high and storm interactions could have a large role in
determining supercell longevity. That being said, environmental
conditions do support the potential for long-track tornadoes.

...Lower MO Valley into the Mid MS and Lower OH Valleys this
afternoon/evening... 
A persistent low-level jet coupled with modest height falls and
perhaps even some convectively enhanced vorticity maxima will
support widespread elevated thunderstorms. Some hail is possible
with the stronger, more consistent cores as this activity moves
northeastward. There is some chance that storms along the
southernmost tier of this activity begin to interact with the warm
front (and potentially a weak frontal low) in the southeast
MO/southern IL/far western KY vicinity. As a result, there could be
a period where a more organized convective line develops, with an
attendant threat for damaging wind gusts.

...Southwest TX/TX Hill Country tonight...
Second shortwave trough mentioned in the synopsis is forecast to
cross northern/central Mexico and move into the southern High Plains
late tonight. Steep mid-level lapse and associated significant
elevated buoyancy will be in place, and thunderstorm development is
anticipated as the shortwave moves into the region. Strong shear
will also be in place, which will likely aid in the development of
supercells capable of large to very large hail.

Areas affected...parts of nern OK...nrn AR...sern KS...srn and cntrl
MO

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 112...

Valid 041206Z - 041400Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 112
continues.

SUMMARY...The risk for severe hail is expected to lessen with time
as an evolving cluster of thunderstorms overspreads southern into
central Missouri through 9-11 AM CDT.  A new severe weather watch
probably will not be needed, but trends will continue to be
monitored.

DISCUSSION...Rapid east-northeastward progression of the
lower/mid-tropospheric forcing for ascent and associated stronger
convective development, near the leading edge of northward returning
plume of elevated mixed layer air, continues.  Through 14-16Z, the
primary clustering of thunderstorm activity appears likely to
overspread areas near and south of the Missouri Interstate 44
corridor, toward the Greater St. Louis vicinity.  This is getting
further removed from the stalled, sharp surface frontal zone now
across/just south of the Memphis through Texarkana vicinities. 
However, models suggest that moisture return above the cold
surface-based air is maintaining inflow of air characterized by CAPE
in excess of 1000 J/kg.   

With convection continuing to consolidate into less discrete
elements the risk for severe hail seems likely to lessen with
northeastward progression.  A few gusts approaching severe limits
have recently been observed to the southeast of Tulsa.  However,
barring the development of a more substantive surface pressure
perturbation, which may not be out of the question, but seems low in
probability, the risk for severe surface gusts probably will not
increase.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0322 AM CDT Fri Apr 04 2025

Valid 071200Z - 121200Z

...DISCUSSION...
...Monday/Day 4 and Tuesday/Day 5...
On Monday, a cold front is forecast to move southeastward across the
eastern Carolinas, southeast Georgia and Florida. It appears that
pockets of moderate instability will be possible ahead of the front
by midday. Considering that strong deep-layer shear is forecast
across much of the Southeast, thunderstorms that form near the front
could develop an isolated severe threat. Severe wind gusts would be
possible near the leading edge of a convective line. However, the
timing of the cold front as it passes through the Southeast remains
questionable, and uncertainty exists concerning instability,
suggesting predictability is low for Monday.

On Tuesday, surface high pressure is forecast to move across the
central and eastern U.S. Relatively dry and stable air should limit
any severe potential across the continental U.S Tuesday.

...Wednesday/Day 6 to Friday/Day 8...
From Wednesday to Friday, a cold front and an associated mid-level
trough is forecast to move southeastward across the central and
eastern U.S. Thunderstorm development will be possible ahead of the
trough near the front, beginning Wednesday night in the central
Plains. The most reliable model forecasts suggest that the most
likely area for an isolated severe threat on Thursday would be from
the central Plains into the mid Mississippi Valley. The severe
potential is forecast to shift eastward into the Carolinas on
Friday. Severe wind gusts and hail would be the primary threats.
During the mid to late week, instability is forecast to remain
relatively weak ahead of the front. Also, the timing of the trough
is still in question. This suggest that predictability is low from
Wednesday to Friday.

Mesoscale Discussion 0382
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0343 PM CDT Thu Apr 03 2025

Areas affected...Northeast TX into northwest LA and southern AR

Concerning...Tornado Watch 109...

Valid 032043Z - 032215Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 109 continues.

SUMMARY...Storm intensification is possible by late afternoon.
Tornadic supercells remain possible near/south of the front, in
addition to a threat of severe hail and wind.

DISCUSSION...Some increase in deep convection has been noted across
northeast TX, along and south/east of an outflow-reinforced surface
front draped from northern MS into southern AR and northeast TX. The
environment remains quite favorable for tornadic supercells within
the warm sector in this region, with the 19Z SHV sounding depicting
MLCAPE in excess of 3000 J/kg, 60 kt of effective shear, and 0-1 km
SRH of greater than 200 m2/s2. However, in the absence of stronger
large-scale ascent, it remains uncertain if any supercells can
mature prior to moving to the cool side of the surface front. Any
sustained surface-based supercells could pose some threat of
significant (EF2+) tornadoes within this environment. Otherwise, a
threat for severe hail (possibly greater than 2 inches in diameter)
and damaging wind will accompany any supercells (surface-based or
elevated) within this regime.

Mesoscale Discussion 0381
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0331 PM CDT Thu Apr 03 2025

Areas affected...Portions of West Virginia and northern Virginia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 032031Z - 032300Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Storms moving into West Virginia may pose a threat of
severe weather this afternoon and evening.  Convective trends will
continue to be monitored, although a watch appears unlikely at this
time.

DISCUSSION...Despite midlevel height rises across the area,
low-level warm-air advection continues to support thunderstorm
development across eastern Kentucky.  The storms are expected to
continue moving eastward across West Virginia, though high clouds
and poorer boundary-layer moisture (per 18Z RNK sounding) have
limited destabilization.  With low-level flow (and attendant warm
advection) forecast to increase into the evening, there is a threat
for the convection to persist.  Given the sufficient low-level and
deep-layer shear across the area, these storms will have the
potential to produce damaging winds, hail, and a tornado. Trends
will be monitored through the evening, but a watch appears to be
unlikely at this time.

0211 PM CDT Thu Apr 03 2025

Areas affected...eastern Kentucky

Concerning...Tornado Watch 107...

Valid 031911Z - 032115Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 107 continues.

SUMMARY...Storms across eastern Kentucky continue to pose a threat
of damaging winds, hail, and tornadoes this afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Sustained low-level warm-air advection continues to
support thunderstorms across eastern Kentucky.  Afternoon insolation
and a narrow axis of better moisture (upper 60s dewpoints) extending
into eastern Kentucky have resulted in MLCAPE values approaching
1000 J/kg. The deep-layer flow and shear (over 50 kts per
mesoanalysis and local VWPs) are more than sufficient for organized
storm modes.  Currently, the dominant convective mode of north-south
oriented bands along the differential heating zone seems to favor
severe-wind potential at this time; however, the strong low-level
shear would support tornado potential pending a more favorable
convective mode.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0300 PM CDT Thu Apr 03 2025

Valid 032000Z - 041200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS
AFTERNOON/EVENING FROM NORTHEAST TX TO MIDDLE TN...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms will continue to form and move along a stalled
frontal zone from northeast Texas into middle Tennessee and southern
Kentucky through late evening, with the possibility of very large
hail and a couple of strong tornadoes.  Very large hail will be
possible after midnight from southwest Texas into cnetral Texas and
southern Oklahoma.

...Northeast TX to middle TN/southern KY this afternoon/evening...
Severe storms are developing along and to the immediate cool side of
a rain-reinforced baroclinic zone from northeast TX across AR and
middle TN/southern KY.  Initial storm motions will tend to carry the
convection to the cool side of the boundary (especially across AR),
though there is some potential for surface-based supercells to form
and move along the wind shift.  The warm sector to the south is
characterized by boundary-layer dewpoints ranging from mid 60s F
across TN/KY to low 70s F from northeast TX into southern AR.  The
rich moisture and surface temperatures warming into the low-mid 80s
beneath 7-8.5 C/km midlevel lapse rates maintain MLCAPE ranging from
1500 J/kg east to 3000+ in northeast TX/northern LA.  Deep-layer
vertical shear/hodograph length is more than sufficient for
sustained supercells, while substantial low-level hodograph
curvature (effective SRH of 200-300 m2/s2) and the moist boundary
layer will support the potential for a couple of strong tornadoes
with supercells moving along the boundary.  Otherwise, large hail of
1.5-2.5 inches in diameter will be possible with both the
surface-based and elevated supercells, as well as isolated wind
damage as storms train along and just north of the boundary.

...SW into central TX and southern OK overnight...
Within the large-scale trough over the Southwest, an embedded jet
streak will move through the base of the trough from Baja to
southwest TX by the end of the period.  Mass response to the
approaching jet streak will result in strengthening warm advection
and the likelihood of elevated thunderstorm development over
southwest TX after 06z.  Storms will subsequently spread
northeastward, with additional storm development expected by 12z
from northwest TX into southern OK.  Steep midlevel lapse rates, a
rapid increase in moisture above the surface, and strong deep-layer
shear will favor elevated supercells capable of producing very large
hail (2-3 inches in diameter), as well as isolated damaging surface
winds.

..Thompson.. 04/03/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1130 AM CDT Thu Apr 03 2025/

...Southern Plains/Mid-South/Tennessee Valley...
With a prominent upper trough over the West, strong southwesterly
winds aloft will overlie areas along/north of a frontal zone
extending from the middle part of Texas into the ArkLaTex/Mid-South,
east-northeastward to the central Appalachians and Mid-Atlantic
States. With neutral to slightly rising mid-level heights, the
convectively reinforced front is forecast to move little today
across the ArkLaTex, Mid-South, and Tennessee Valley.

Even though large-scale ascent will tend to remain somewhat nebulous
near the front and southward into the warm sector, persistent
low-level warm advection should aid in renewed thunderstorm
development along/near the stalled front through the afternoon and
evening. Any convection which can form on or just south of this
boundary will have a rather favorably moist low-level airmass, steep
lapse rates aloft, and strong deep-layer shear to support organized
updrafts.

A notable diurnal strengthening of the low-level jet /45-55 kt/ is
expected today across the ArkLaTex to the Mid-South/Lower
Mississippi Valley, where it will impinge on the west/southwest to
east/northeast-oriented effective front. This is concerning
regarding supercell tornado potential later today, some of which
could be strong (EF2+) given the magnitudes of the
deep-layer/low-level shear and moisture-rich environment with
surface dewpoints in the upper 60s/near 70F. That said, some
modal/mesoscale uncertainties still persist as to warm-sector
development and the coverage and longevity of surface-based
supercells, with convection potentially tending to be more
prevalent/likely just north of the effective front. Otherwise, large
to very large hail will be a threat with the expected supercellular
development along/north of the front, with upscale-growing clusters
posing a damaging wind threat as well.

...West-central/North Texas and southern Oklahoma late tonight...
Elevated supercells are expected to again develop late tonight
(after midnight CDT) and early Friday as forcing for ascent
increases to the north of the surface front. These storms will pose
a large hail threat, and possibly some severe-wind potential as
well, particularly if elevated bow echo development occurs as storms
spread northeastward within a highly sheared environment.

...Central Appalachians to Mid-Atlantic/Delmarva...
Remnants of convection and related outflow boundaries will serve as
a northern limit to any appreciable severe threat today. While some
details remain uncertain, any storms that develop along/south of the
front could pose risks for hail and damaging winds.

0236 PM CDT Thu Apr 03 2025

Valid 041200Z - 051200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

Locally elevated conditions are possible in the lowlands of
south-central New Mexico under diminishing southwest flow aloft amid
residual surface dryness. Otherwise, the previous forecast (see
below) remains on track.

...Synopsis...
Downstream of a highly amplified large-scale trough centered on the
Southwest, a belt of strong south-southwesterly flow and embedded
midlevel speed maximum will shift eastward into TX. While a weak
surface cyclone and related breezy conditions will persist over
parts of southern/central NM, the meridional orientation and
displacement of the midlevel jet will limit fire-weather concerns
compared to previous days.

0223 PM CDT Thu Apr 03 2025

Valid 051200Z - 061200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR EASTERN
TEXAS TO WESTERN MISSISSIPPI...

...SUMMARY...
Severe storms producing damaging winds and a few tornadoes are
forecast Saturday and Saturday night from the Sabine Valley to the
Tennessee Valley.

...Synopsis...
A mid-level speed max across northern Mexico, rounding the base of a
larger scale trough, will emerge and strengthen into a 100 knot jet
streak across the southern Plains on Saturday. As this occurs, a
closed surface low is forecast to develop somewhere near the
ArkLatex Saturday afternoon/evening and move along the pre-existing
frontal zone to northern Mississippi by Sunday morning. An
unseasonably warm/moist airmass will be in place south of this front
which will support potentially multiple rounds of severe storms on
Saturday and Saturday night. 

...Eastern Texas to the Mid-Mississippi Valley...
A cluster of storms, emanating from initial elevated supercells
across central Texas, will likely be ongoing at the beginning of the
period across east Texas. The very moist airmass, featuring
dewpoints in the low 70s, and the strong wind field, will likely
support some severe threat from this activity through the morning as
it moves east. Guidance remains unclear whether this convection will
strengthen through the day and pose some severe weather threat (such
as shown by the ECMWF), or if it weakens and moves into
Arkansas/northern Mississippi and reinforces the baroclinic zone.
The evolution of this morning activity will affect both the timing
and the intensity of the severe weather threat as a more robust
morning MCS through the warm sector would probably inhibit a greater
supercell tornado threat later in the day with a much reduced
available warm sector. Despite these uncertainties, an ejecting
mid-level trough with a very strong jet streak, a developing surface
low, and an unseasonably warm/moist airmass will support a
significant severe weather threat on Saturday. 

...Mid-Mississippi Valley to the Upper Ohio Valley...
Mid 60s dewpoints are expected along and ahead of the cold front
from northeast Arkansas to western Pennsylvania on Saturday morning.
Expansive cloud cover will likely inhibit significant
destabilization. However, weak instability associated with the moist
airmass could support maintenance of a squall line along and south
of the Ohio River and perhaps a few stronger, more cellular storms
from eastern Ohio into western Pennsylvania.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1230 PM CDT Thu Apr 03 2025

Valid 041200Z - 051200Z

...THERE IS A MODERATE RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THE ARKLATEX
INTO WESTERN ARKANSAS...

...SUMMARY...
Several clusters of strong to severe storms are possible from
central Texas across the ArkLaTex and into the lower Ohio Valley
Friday and Friday night. The greatest threat for tornadoes, large
hail and damaging winds will be from the ArkLaTex across western
Arkansas, including potential for strong to potentially intense
tornadoes.

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough, centered across the Southwest and northern New
Mexico, will start to shift east on Friday. As this occurs a broad,
strong low-level jet will develop across eastern Texas and into
Louisiana, Arkansas, and Mississippi. This strengthening lower
tropospheric flow will aid in the northward advancement of a warm
front, located from central Texas to the Mid-Mississippi Valley at
the beginning of the period, to eastern Oklahoma an near the MO/AR
border by 00Z Sat. This reorientation of the frontal boundary should
be favorable for supercells with the potential for large hail (some
2+ inch), damaging wind gusts, and tornadoes (some potentially
EF3+). 

...ArkLatex to Western Arkansas...
As a warm front lifts north across Arkansas through the day, a very
unstable environment (2500-4000 J/kg MLCAPE) will develop from the
ArkLaTex into western Arkansas as temperatures warm into the mid 80s
with dewpoints in the low 70s. Some weak convection may maintain
along the frontal zone in eastern Oklahoma during the morning and
early afternoon. However, more robust convective development is not
anticipated until mid-afternoon when height falls start to
overspread the region, and the influence of the entrance region of
the upper-level jet increases ascent. In addition, most high
resolution guidance indicates a local area of low pressure may
traverse the frontal zone to near northwest Arkansas by 21Z. The
combination of these factors, which have decent agreement among 12Z
guidance, points toward multiple supercells along the frontal zone
during the mid to late afternoon and into the evening. These
supercells, in an environment featuring 2500-3500 J/kg MLCAPE and
0-1km SRH ~400 m2/s2, will support the potential for strong to
intense tornadoes. Messy storm mode could limit the longevity of any
of these supercells/tornadoes, but even with limited duration, the
environment supports a tornado threat.

A more conditional long-track tornado threat, which would also bring
greater opportunity for EF3+ tornadoes, exists east of the frontal
boundary. Synoptic forcing ahead of the boundary is relatively weak,
but very strong instability (3000-4000 J/kg MLCAPE) is forecast with
minimal inhibition across the warm sector. Therefore, more discrete,
open warm-sector supercell development is possible, but will be more
dependent on mesoscale details which will become more clear in the
Day 1 timeframe.

...Missouri into the Ohio Valley...
Storm mode and destabilization will be a lot more unclear farther
northeast along the frontal zone from southern Missouri and into
western Ohio. Multiple rounds of ongoing storms and new development
are anticipated through the period in a strongly sheared
environment, but storm motion will likely keep the majority of
storms on the cool side of the boundary. Any storms which can stay
along or south of the boundary will pose some severe weather threat
with all hazards possible, particularly farther southwest, closer to
the richer low-level moisture. However, hail, and perhaps some wind
gusts will be possible with any storms in this region. 

...West Texas to Central Texas...
Strong elevated instability (2500-3000 J/kg MUCAPE) is forecast
across central Texas and into portions of west Texas Friday night
and into early Saturday morning. This instability, combined with
very strong shear (70-80 knots per NAM forecast soundings), will
support elevated supercells capable of large hail (perhaps 2+")
early Saturday morning as the low-level jet reintensifies and
orients into central Texas ahead of the approaching mid-level
trough.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1136 AM CDT Thu Apr 03 2025

Valid 031700Z - 041200Z

Eastern extent of Elevated highlights in portions of eastern New
Mexico and the far western Texas Panhandle was trimmed slightly back
to the west. This is to account for recent precipitation and
considerably higher relative humidity, which should continue to
overspread far eastern New Mexico from portions northwestern Texas
through the day. Otherwise, the previous forecast (see below)
remains on track.

..Squitieri/Williams.. 04/03/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0151 AM CDT Thu Apr 03 2025/

...Synopsis...
Within the base of a highly amplified large-scale trough over the
West, a 70-80-kt midlevel southwesterly speed maximum will emerge
over the southern High Plains. In response, a weak lee cyclone will
develop over southeast CO, while another broad/weak surface cyclone
forms along the tail end of a front south of the TX Big Bend. Aided
by downslope flow and diurnal heating on the western edge of
increasing cloud coverage, a corridor of 15-20 percent RH will
develop from southern NM northeastward to far southeast CO. Here,
around 15-20 mph sustained southwesterly surface winds will favor
elevated fire-weather conditions. Locally elevated fire-weather
conditions are also possible over the TX Big Bend, where dry/breezy
conditions are expected north of the surface cyclone.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1130 AM CDT Thu Apr 03 2025

Valid 031630Z - 041200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
ARKLATEX AND MID-SOUTH REGIONS...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are likely today along a frontal zone from the
southern Plains into the lower Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys.
The most concentrated corridor for severe potential should be
focused from the ArkLaTex across the Mid-South into Middle
Tennessee. Large hail, damaging winds, and a few strong tornadoes
are all possible.

...Southern Plains/Mid-South/Tennessee Valley...
With a prominent upper trough over the West, strong southwesterly
winds aloft will overlie areas along/north of a frontal zone
extending from the middle part of Texas into the ArkLaTex/Mid-South,
east-northeastward to the central Appalachians and Mid-Atlantic
States. With neutral to slightly rising mid-level heights, the
convectively reinforced front is forecast to move little today
across the ArkLaTex, Mid-South, and Tennessee Valley.

Even though large-scale ascent will tend to remain somewhat nebulous
near the front and southward into the warm sector, persistent
low-level warm advection should aid in renewed thunderstorm
development along/near the stalled front through the afternoon and
evening. Any convection which can form on or just south of this
boundary will have a rather favorably moist low-level airmass, steep
lapse rates aloft, and strong deep-layer shear to support organized
updrafts.

A notable diurnal strengthening of the low-level jet /45-55 kt/ is
expected today across the ArkLaTex to the Mid-South/Lower
Mississippi Valley, where it will impinge on the west/southwest to
east/northeast-oriented effective front. This is concerning
regarding supercell tornado potential later today, some of which
could be strong (EF2+) given the magnitudes of the
deep-layer/low-level shear and moisture-rich environment with
surface dewpoints in the upper 60s/near 70F. That said, some
modal/mesoscale uncertainties still persist as to warm-sector
development and the coverage and longevity of surface-based
supercells, with convection potentially tending to be more
prevalent/likely just north of the effective front. Otherwise, large
to very large hail will be a threat with the expected supercellular
development along/north of the front, with upscale-growing clusters
posing a damaging wind threat as well.

...West-central/North Texas and southern Oklahoma late tonight...
Elevated supercells are expected to again develop late tonight
(after midnight CDT) and early Friday as forcing for ascent
increases to the north of the surface front. These storms will pose
a large hail threat, and possibly some severe-wind potential as
well, particularly if elevated bow echo development occurs as storms
spread northeastward within a highly sheared environment.

...Central Appalachians to Mid-Atlantic/Delmarva...
Remnants of convection and related outflow boundaries will serve as
a northern limit to any appreciable severe threat today. While some
details remain uncertain, any storms that develop along/south of the
front could pose risks for hail and damaging winds.

0638 AM CDT Thu Apr 03 2025

Areas affected...north Texas and southeast OK

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 106...

Valid 031138Z - 031345Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 106
continues.

SUMMARY...Elevated cells will continue to pose a large hail risk
this morning across portions of north Texas into southeast Oklahoma.

DISCUSSION...A couple of strong, elevated supercells across western
north TX will continue to shift east through the morning. This
activity is occurring in a warm advection regime atop a stalled
surface boundary draped across north/north-central Texas eastward to
the AR/LA border. Steep midlevel lapse rates are contributing to
modest elevated instability, with MUCAPE values around 1000-2000
J/kg noted in latest mesoanalysis. Additional cells may develop
within this regime through the morning hours and large hail
potential may persist beyond the 13z expiration time of Severe
Thunderstorm Watch 106. Some severe potential also could persist
downstream of the current watch, though north and east extent is
somewhat uncertain. A new watch, or a local watch extension will
likely be needed in the next hour or so.

Concerning...Tornado Watch 94...96...

Valid 021217Z - 021415Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 94, 96 continues.

SUMMARY...Strong/damaging gusts and a couple of tornadoes remain
possible across WW 94 and 96 over west-central MO. A downstream
watch may be needed later this morning, though timing is uncertain.

DISCUSSION...Strong to severe thunderstorms continue near a surface
cold front across western MO this morning. Boundary layer moistening
is slowly occurring as an intense low-level jet streams over the
area, contributing to enlarged, looping hodographs. Some rotation
has been noted amid the somewhat messy storm mode early this
morning. Capping and weaker instability with eastward extent likely
is tempering severe potential somewhat, but isolated strong gusts, a
couple of tornadoes and sporadic large hail remain possible. This
convection will continue to propagate eastward through the morning
and some potential for a downstream watch into east-central MO
exists. However, timing is uncertain as destabilization is expected
to be more modest across eastern MO through the morning hours.
Trends will continue to be monitored.

Concerning...Tornado Watch 95...96...

Valid 021157Z - 021400Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 95, 96 continues.

SUMMARY...Damaging wind and tornado potential may be maximized
across northeast Oklahoma into extreme southwest Missouri/northwest
Arkansas over the next couple of hours.

DISCUSSION...Recent radar trends have shows some propensity for
linear convection to become more supercellular. This activity is
moving across the max STP corridor (effective layer STP around 5-7)
amid strong vertical shear and moderate instability. While some
rotation has been occurring, and even a brief TDS was noted over
Tulsa and Rogers Counties in northeast OK, capping and storm motion
parallel to the surface front is likely limiting the longevity of
stronger/better organized cells within the broader line of
convection. Nevertheless, a couple of tornadoes, damaging gusts and
isolated large hail remain possible this morning.

Areas affected...portions of North Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 021115Z - 021315Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated gusty winds and marginal hail to near 1 inch
possible this morning. Overall risk is expected to remain low and a
watch is not expected.

DISCUSSION...Elevated convection has developed along an
eastward-advancing cold front across western north Texas this
morning. Mid-60s dewpoints beneath steep midlevel lapse rates are
contributing to strong MLCAPE amid intense vertical shear. Capping
and modest linear forcing associated with the cold front will likely
preclude greater severe potential despite the favorable
thermodynamic and kinematic parameter space. Nevertheless, isolated
gusty winds and perhaps hail to near 1 inch diameter will be
possible. Watch issuance is not currently expected, but radar trends
will continue to be monitored through the morning.
