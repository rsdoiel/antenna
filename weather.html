Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0652 PM CST Thu Jan 04 2024

Valid 050100Z - 051200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered non-severe thunderstorms are possible late tonight over
parts of southeast Texas including the Texas Coast.

...Discussion...
Sporadic lightning is noted this evening over southeast NM, where
cold temperatures aloft exist in proximity to the upper low. The
loss of diabatic heating is expected to further reduce thunderstorm
chances as the trough moves into western TX, though isolated flashes
cannot be ruled out with weak elevated instability present.

A greater probability of thunderstorms will develop late tonight
into Friday morning over southeast TX and much of the TX Coast.
Here, more robust theta-e advection will develop atop the cool
boundary layer, and as 850-mb winds increase to 40 kt out of the
south. Despite strong shear, little to no severe threat is forecast,
due to only weak elevated instability, and cool surface air over
land.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0336 PM CST Thu Jan 04 2024

Valid 061200Z - 121200Z

Fire weather concerns are expected to remain low through the
extended period. Enhanced flow across the southern US will bring
localized windy/dry conditions D3 - Saturday and D4 - Sunday.
Potential for widespread rainfall across already moist fuels on D2
Friday will further limit the potential for fire spread. 

A potent surface low is expected to develop across the southern
Plains on D5 - Monday tracking eastward before moving into the Upper
Ohio River Valley by D7 - Wednesday. This will bring the potential
for very strong surface winds but also additional precipitation
chances. The driest conditions are expected to be across portions of
southwestern and far western Texas on D5 - Monday through D7 -
Wednesday, where less precipitation is likely with multiple periods
of windy/dry conditions. Locally Elevated conditions may be
possible, particularly across far western Texas south into the Rio
Grande Valley. Given the seasonably moist conditions of fuels and
potential for multiple rounds of precipitation keeping the threat
localized, confidence remains too low to include any areas at this
time.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1113 AM CST Wed Jan 03 2024

Valid 041200Z - 051200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not forecast through early Friday.

...TX vicinity...
A pronounced shortwave trough over AZ will move east into the
southern Great Plains through early Friday. Forcing for ascent
driven by mid-level height falls ahead of this wave in conjunction
with steep mid-level lapse rates may compensate for limited
low-level moisture to yield scant elevated buoyancy. Sporadic
lightning flashes will be possible within a confined convective band
from east NM to central TX, although overall coverage should remain
very isolated. 

Greater thunder potential will occur early Friday morning towards
the TX coastal plain as low-level warm theta-e advection yields
increasing moisture from the western Gulf. This activity should
remain elevated over land, with minor surface cyclogenesis
anticipated just offshore in the northwest Gulf. A weak supercell is
possible along the immediate middle/upper TX Gulf Coast vicinity
towards 12Z, but the bulk of intensifying deep convection should
remain offshore.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1024 AM CST Wed Jan 03 2024

Valid 031630Z - 041200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected today or tonight.

...FL Gulf coast tonight...
A southern-stream shortwave trough will continue eastward over the
Gulf coast today and off the southeast Atlantic coast tonight, with
only a weak surface reflection of the midlevel wave.  The majority
of the surface warm sector with the Gulf coast trough will remain
offshore, with only a small part of the unstable warm sector
expected to reach the west central FL coast tonight.  Still,
marginal midlevel lapse rates and low-level moistening will tend to
limit buoyancy over land, which will be greatest after low-level
shear and forcing for ascent begin to weaken.  A strong storm might
approach the Tampa area tonight, but the severe threat appears too
limited to justify adding an outlook area.

...Southern CA/NV into AZ through tonight...
Low-topped convection with isolated lightning flashes will be
possible today along the central/southern CA coasts in association
with relatively steep low-midlevel lapse rates beneath the midlevel
thermal trough, as the midlevel trough moves from central/southern
CA toward southern NV.  Isolated lightning flashes will also be
possible with pockets of weak destabilization as the midlevel
vorticity center moves over southern NV this afternoon/evening. 
Midlevel cooling/moistening could also support isolated lightning
flashes with weak convection overnight in the zone of ascent
preceding the midlevel trough over southeast AZ.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1024 AM CST Wed Jan 03 2024

Valid 031700Z - 041200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The current D1 Fire Weather Outlook remains on track with no updates
needed. See previous discussion below.

..Thornton.. 01/03/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1251 AM CST Wed Jan 03 2024/

...Synopsis...
Minimal fire weather concerns are expected today. Latest fuel
guidance reveals some recent drying from the southern High Plains
into the central and northern High Plains. However, early-morning
surface observations show a cold front pushing southward through the
Northern Plains that should usher in cooler temperatures by this
afternoon. Similarly, surface high pressure over the southern Plains
after a recent frontal passage will favor cool and fairly calm
conditions this afternoon.
