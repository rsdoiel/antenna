Mesoscale Discussion 0008
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0756 AM CST Sun Jan 05 2025

Areas affected...southeast Kansas...much of southern Missouri...far
southern Illinois and western Kentucky

Concerning...Winter mixed precipitation 

Valid 051356Z - 051800Z

SUMMARY...A combination of snow, sleet, and freezing rain will
become mostly rain by late morning.

DISCUSSION...13Z surface analysis shows a 1004 mb surface low in
eastern Oklahoma with strong high pressure across the northern
Plains and Great Lakes region. Northeasterly surface winds resulting
from this pressure gradient continue to supply low-level arctic air
to areas north of the warm front from Kansas to the Lower Ohio
Valley. Strong 850mb warm air advection has resulted in a thermal
profile favorable for freezing rain across a broad region from
southeast Kansas and across much of southern Missouri early this
morning. The 0C 850mb line will continue to slowly shift north as
strong warm air advection occurs ahead of the surface cyclone. This
will result in snow changing to freezing rain in the next few hours
across parts of southern Illinois and western Kentucky. Areas across
southern Missouri where temperatures are currently near freezing
will likely rise above freezing this morning and bring an end to the
freezing rain threat. However, for much of the area currently
observing freezing rain, the threat will persist through at least
midday.

Mesoscale Discussion 0007
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0727 AM CST Sun Jan 05 2025

Areas affected...east-central Missouri...parts of southern
Illinois...southern Indiana...and parts of central Kentucky.

Concerning...Heavy snow 

Valid 051327Z - 051730Z

SUMMARY...1+ inch per hour snowfall rates are expected this morning.

DISCUSSION...Light to  moderate snowfall has developed within a
swath from central Missouri to central Kentucky this morning with a
few heavy snow observations appearing recently in southern Illinois
and southern Indiana. Expect moderate to heavy snow in a relatively
narrow corridor north of the freezing rain from east-central
Missouri to parts of central Kentucky. In addition to the radar
depiction and surface observations indicating heavy snow, the 12Z
HRRR shows a swath of significant accumulation between 13Z and 17Z.
By midday much of this area will switch to freezing rain with the
heavy snow swath shifted farther north during the afternoon as warm
air advection strengthens ahead of the approaching surface low.

Mesoscale Discussion 0006
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0651 AM CST Sun Jan 05 2025

Areas affected...northeast Kansas into west-central Missouri

Concerning...Blizzard 

Valid 051251Z - 051715Z

SUMMARY...Snowfall rates and winds are increasing. Blizzard
conditions will develop this morning.

DISCUSSION...Light to moderate snow is now being observed across
most of northeast Kansas and west-central Missouri. Expect further
increase in snowfall intensity through the morning as the
mid-latitude cyclone continues to organize. Snowfall rates over 2
inches per hour are possible with 40 to 50% probabilities indicated
by the HREF. In addition, winds are expected to increase further as
strong high pressure builds into the northern Plains. The resulting
pressure gradient will lead to sustained winds of 25 to 30 mph and
gusts over 40 mph for much of the day. This will result in
significant blowing and drifting and visibility restrictions.
Blizzard/near-blizzard conditions are likely along the I-70 corridor
from central Kansas to west-central Missouri through most of the day
today.

Mesoscale Discussion 0005
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0439 AM CST Sun Jan 05 2025

Areas affected...portions of southwest and south-central Kansas.

Concerning...Blizzard 

Valid 051039Z - 051545Z

SUMMARY...Blizzard conditions developing.

DISCUSSION...A deformation band has started to organize across
southwest Kansas and the OK/northern TX Panhandles. As this rotates
eastward, heavy snow with 1+ inch per hour rates are expected. In
addition, strong winds are already present (sustained 31 mph at KGBD
on the 956Z observation) and are expected to strengthen further over
the next 3 to 6 hours. Temperatures are in the mid teens which
should result in less dense snow and accentuate visibility
reductions amid strong winds. This will likely result in some
blizzard conditions across parts of southwest and south-central
Kansas through the morning. 

Freezing rain is falling across eastern portions of the MD area
where warmer mid-level air has advected west to the north of the
surface low. However, expect these areas to transition to snow after
13-14Z once the surface low moves farther east.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0648 AM CST Sun Jan 05 2025

Valid 051300Z - 061200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are expected this afternoon and evening from
the Sabine River Valley into the Mid-South and lower Mississippi
Valley. Tornadoes and scattered severe/damaging winds should be the
primary threats. A couple of strong tornadoes may also occur.

...East Texas into the Mid-South and Lower Mississippi Valley...
A strong shortwave trough over the central/southern High Plains this
morning will evolve into a closed upper low later today over eastern
KS/western MO. Related mid-level height falls and large-scale ascent
will encourage the primary surface low over central OK to develop
eastward to the Mid-South vicinity by late afternoon/early evening.
An attendant cold front will continue to sweep east-southeastward
over the southern Plains and lower MS Valley/Southeast through
tonight. Pronounced low-level mass response, with a 45-60 kt
low-level jet, will aid in the northward transport of partially
modified Gulf moisture across east TX and the lower MS Valley ahead
of the surging cold front.

Even though low/mid-level lapse rates are forecast to generally
remain modest, low to mid 60s surface dewpoints should be present by
early afternoon in a narrow corridor along and just ahead of the
cold front from parts of east TX to northern MS and vicinity.
Filtered daytime heating should support around 500-1000 J/kg of
MLCAPE by mid afternoon, with weaker instability with northward
extent into western TN near the surface low. Ample deep-layer shear
(40-50 kt) will be present across the warm sector to support
organized severe convection, including the potential for some
supercells. Current expectations are for surface-based convection to
develop and corresponding severe threat to increase in the early to
mid afternoon as the boundary layer gradually destabilizes. Given
the forcing of the cold front itself, a line of convection is
expected to eventually consolidate and pose a threat for mainly
scattered severe/damaging winds and a few tornadoes as it moves
quickly eastward through the early evening.

However, most high-resolution guidance shows some chance for
thunderstorms to develop along a weak surface trough/confluence zone
ahead of the front early this afternoon from parts of
central/northern LA into western MS. The strong low-level jet will
support enhanced low-level shear (effective SRH around 200-350+
m2/s2), and a threat for tornadoes with any supercells that can
mature in the narrow warm sector ahead of the surging cold front.
Given the rather favorable shear and enlarged low-level hodographs
shown in 06Z NAM/11Z RAP forecast soundings, a couple of strong
(EF-2) tornadoes appear possible with any sustained supercell across
this region. The best time frame for this tornado potential should
be mainly around 19-23Z, before any pre-frontal convection becomes
absorbed within the line. Isolated hail may also occur with this
activity. Embedded/QLCS tornadoes and damaging winds will still
remain possible for as long as the line can remain surface based.
Severe potential should quickly diminish with the line late this
evening and overnight as it continues into AL and encounters a less
favorable thermodynamic environment.

Valid 061200Z - 071200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
With a fairly expansive trough across much of the U.S. on Monday,
fire weather concerns are expected to be minimal on account of
cool/cold conditions and higher RH values. There will be modest
increase in offshore winds in southern California towards Tuesday
morning, but winds and RH still appear too marginal for more than a
locally elevated threat.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0256 PM CST Thu Jan 02 2025

Valid 041200Z - 101200Z

A progressive upper pattern will prevail over the CONUS this weekend
into next week, resulting in rapid surface low development over the
Plains this weekend, followed by widespread surface high pressure
and colder air overspreading most of the CONUS through the week.
Behind the surface low, downslope flow along the lee of the southern
Rockies will promote dry and windy conditions amid drying fuels over
southern High Plains on Day 3 (Saturday), where 70 percent Critical
probabilities have been introduced. 

After surface high pressure becomes fortified across the Great Basin
and points east next week, a pressure gradient will become
established across southern California in the Days 6-8
(Tuesday-Thursday) period. Dry offshore flow atop dry fuels will
promote wildfire-spread potential to some degree. There is some
variability in medium-rage guidance as to when the best upper-level
support will overspread southern California to promote strong to
damaging offshore winds. However, there is enough agreement among
guidance members in strong, dry offshore flow on Days 6-8
(Tuesday-Thursday) to warrant 40 percent Critical probabilities. As
more guidance becomes available and the timing of maximum upper
support becomes clearer, Critical probabilities may need to be
adjusted Tuesday through Thursday, with the possibility of higher
Critical probabilities being needed as well.

Thunderstorms are not expected to remainder of today/tonight given
dry and stable conditions across much of the country. No changes are

..Leitman.. 01/02/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1021 AM CST Thu Jan 02 2025/

...Synopsis...
In the mid levels, The general pattern is forecast to slowly amplify
as weak troughing with broad cyclonic flow will persist over the
eastern 2/3rds of the CONUS. At the same time, ridging will
intensify over the West. This will favor increasingly strong (80-100
kts) northwesterly flow over the central US. As a result, strong
high pressure at the surface is expected over the northern Plains
and Southeast. With cold temperatures and dry/stable offshore flow,
little to no buoyancy is expected inland, aside from extreme
southern/coastal TX. This will suppress thunderstorm potential below
10% coverage.

0125 PM CST Thu Jan 02 2025

Valid 041200Z - 051200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated thunderstorms are possible Sunday morning from far
northwest Texas across central Oklahoma into southeast Kansas.

...Synopsis...
As the upper trough over the Northeast slowly lifts/weakens, a
potent shortwave trough will move rapidly from the Great Basin
Saturday morning and across the central Plains into early Sunday.
High pressure will remain entrenched from the northern Plains into
the Southeast, but low pressure will develop over the southern High
Plains late in the day, moving into OK by 12Z Sunday.

Increasing southerly winds in the low levels will bring a plume of
50s F dewpoints northward across TX and toward the low over OK
Sunday morning. At that time, a warm front will generally extend
from the low southeastward into central MS.

Several hundred J/kg of MUCAPE may eventually develop, most likely
from OK toward the ArkLaTex. Although moistening, the boundary layer
may remain capped over most areas, with the highest probability of
elevated thunderstorms near the low and north of the warm front.
Given the small window in time and space for uncapped surface-based
parcel potential, the presence of strong shear should be moot, and
severe storms are not expected.

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Sporadic lightning flashes may occur Friday afternoon and evening
over the coastal Pacific Northwest. Severe weather is not expected.

...Synopsis...
The pattern on Friday will feature an upper trough over the eastern
CONUS, with a western ridge breaking down late. The shortwave trough
responsible for the ridge breakdown will provide rapid cooling aloft
late in the day from northern CA into western WA and OR, and
overnight across the Great Basin. Given favorable diurnal
timing/steepening lapse rates, a few lightning flashes with
low-topped convection is possible near coastal counties as a cold
front approaches. 

Elsewhere, high pressure will maintain dry and/or stable conditions
over land. A few thunderstorms may occur over the northwest Gulf of
Mexico with a weak low well offshore.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1021 AM CST Thu Jan 02 2025

Valid 021630Z - 031200Z

...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms are not expected through tonight.

...Synopsis...
In the mid levels, The general pattern is forecast to slowly amplify
as weak troughing with broad cyclonic flow will persist over the
eastern 2/3rds of the CONUS. At the same time, ridging will
intensify over the West. This will favor increasingly strong (80-100
kts) northwesterly flow over the central US. As a result, strong
high pressure at the surface is expected over the northern Plains
and Southeast. With cold temperatures and dry/stable offshore flow,
little to no buoyancy is expected inland, aside from extreme
southern/coastal TX. This will suppress thunderstorm potential below
10% coverage.

..Squitieri.. 01/02/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0128 AM CST Thu Jan 02 2025/

...Synopsis...
Elevated fire weather conditions should be ongoing across
terrain-favored areas of southern California. The favorable offshore
wind surface-pressure gradient should hold on a little longer today
than previously expected, resulting in elevated fire weather
conditions lasting into and perhaps through the day -- especially in
terrain-favored areas. Here, winds may gust to near 30 mph and
relative humidity may fall into the upper single digits. Late in the
forecast period, winds may begin to turn more toward the southwest
as a mid-level trough approaches the California coast. As the winds
switch to the southwest, an inland surge of higher humidity should
bring to an end this offshore wind event.

PUBLIC SEVERE WEATHER OUTLOOK  
NWS STORM PREDICTION CENTER NORMAN OK
0715 PM CST SAT DEC 28 2024

...Severe thunderstorms expected over parts of the Gulf Coast States
this evening and overnight...

* LOCATIONS...
  Central and Southern Mississippi
  Western and Central Alabama
  Southeast Louisiana

* HAZARDS...
  Widespread damaging winds, some hurricane force
  Several tornadoes, a few intense
  Isolated large hail

* SUMMARY...
  Tornadoes (some strong with at least EF-2 damage possible) and
  numerous severe/damaging wind gusts are expected this evening
  through tonight. The threat area will shift eastward across
  parts of the lower Mississippi Valley this evening, and continue
  overnight through early Sunday morning over portions of the
  Tennessee Valley, central Gulf Coast states, and western
  Georgia.

Preparedness actions...

Tornadoes at night can be particularly dangerous because they 
are usually fast-moving and difficult to see. Stay tuned to
NOAA Weather Radio, weather.gov, or other media for watches and
warnings. A tornado watch means that conditions are favorable
for tornadoes to form during the next several hours. If a tornado
warning is issued for your area, move to a place of safety,
ideally in a basement or interior room on the lowest floor of a
sturdy building.
