Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0700 AM CST Sun Dec 29 2024

Valid 291300Z - 301200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM THE EASTERN
GULF COAST NORTHWARD INTO THE CAROLINAS AND SOUTHERN VIRGINIA...

...SUMMARY...
A few tornadoes and sporadic damaging to severe gusts are possible
today from the eastern Gulf Coast northward into the Carolinas and
southern Virginia.  More-isolated severe storms may occur across
parts of the central Appalachians and Ohio Valley, and over
southernmost Florida.

...Synopsis...
In mid/upper levels, a progressive pattern will persist across the
CONUS.  A strong shortwave trough will move ashore in the Pacific
Northwest and northern CA today.  This will be preceded by some
thunder potential, as lapse rates steepen from large-scale ascent,
over areas where at least marginal low/middle-level moisture exists
to support convection.  Downstream, a strong shortwave trough was
evident in moisture-channel imagery between the Mid-South and
Tennessee Valley.  This perturbation will pivot northeastward over
TN, KY and IN today, forming a closed 500-mb low by 00Z over the
Michiana region, and phasing with an initially upstream perturbation
now over the central Plains.  By 12Z, the resultant trough should
assume considerable negative tilt, extending from a low over eastern
Lake Huron to the Hampton Roads of VA/northeastern NC region.

The associated surface cyclone was centered at 11Z over southwestern
IN, with cold front across middle TN, central AL, past the
Mississippi River mouth, then across the northwestern Gulf.  The low
is forecast to deepen and occlude today as it moves to near TOL. 
The cold front should sweep across much of the eastern CONUS through
the period.  By 00Z, the front should reach central parts of PA/VA/
NC/SC, southeastern GA, and the eastern Gulf, preceded by a
strong-severe line of thunderstorms.  By 12Z, the front should reach
eastern NY, then offshore until central FL. 

...Southern Atlantic Coast States...
An ongoing, prefrontal squall line, with sporadic/embedded LEWP/
bowing features and an occasional embedded mesovortex, extends from
northwestern SC across central/southern GA and the FL Panhandle, to
the adjoining Gulf.  This convection should become more northeast/
southwest oriented as its northern portion races through the central
Appalachians/Piedmont region today, amid meager but still locally
sufficient buoyancy (MLCAPE mostly less than 400 J/kg), long and
curved low-level hodographs with 200-400 J/kg effective SRH, and
favorable deep shear.  Damaging gusts and a few embedded QLCS
tornadoes will be the main concerns. See SPC Tornado Watches 723-724
and associated mesoscale discussions for the latest near-term
coverage.  

...Central Appalachians/Ohio Valley...
Widely scattered low-topped thunderstorms are possible from midday
through afternoon in a pocket of marginally unstable air ahead of
the surface low and ejecting mid/upper trough.  A marginal threat
exists for damaging gusts or a brief tornado from this activity.  As
the trough approaches, midlevel flow will strengthen considerably,
associated large-scale ascent will steepen low/middle-level lapse
rates, while the mass response increases low-level and deep-layer
shear.  Temperatures from the upper 50s F to mid 60s (southeastern
parts) would support MLCAPE in the 100-400 J/kg range amidst 40-50
kt effective-shear magnitudes and SRH of 100-200 J/kg in the lowest
1/2 km.  Damaging gusts may be brought to the surface via momentum
transfer in downdrafts from the LLJ, and conditional potential
exists for mini-supercells to develop.  Given the weak overall lapse
rates and lack of greater buoyancy, the already marginal threat
should diminish quickly by around 00Z. 

...South FL/Keys...
A small but persistent MCS, with an embedded MCV on its northwest
side, has been moving slowly eastward across the easternmost Gulf
toward Florida Bay for most of the prior overnight hours.  This
complex should affect at least parts of the mid/upper Keys, and
southern Everglades, through midday.  The ambient/synoptic gradients
suggest only modest deep-layer shear this far from the ejecting
shortwave trough.  However, mesoscale midlevel flow enhancement and
low-level mass response will promote some hodograph enlargement in a
small corridor southeast through east of the MCV.  Accordingly,
sporadic and mostly short-lived mesocirculations have been observed
in the complex for several hours, amid rich inflow-layer moisture
and low LCL.  An associated low-end tornado threat may extend into
the outlook area before the complex weakens substantially.  See SPC
Mesoscale Discussion 2317 for near-term details.

PUBLIC SEVERE WEATHER OUTLOOK  
NWS STORM PREDICTION CENTER NORMAN OK
0715 PM CST SAT DEC 28 2024

...Severe thunderstorms expected over parts of the Gulf Coast States
this evening and overnight...

* LOCATIONS...
  Central and Southern Mississippi
  Western and Central Alabama
  Southeast Louisiana

* HAZARDS...
  Widespread damaging winds, some hurricane force
  Several tornadoes, a few intense
  Isolated large hail

* SUMMARY...
  Tornadoes (some strong with at least EF-2 damage possible) and
  numerous severe/damaging wind gusts are expected this evening
  through tonight. The threat area will shift eastward across
  parts of the lower Mississippi Valley this evening, and continue
  overnight through early Sunday morning over portions of the
  Tennessee Valley, central Gulf Coast states, and western
  Georgia.

Preparedness actions...

Tornadoes at night can be particularly dangerous because they 
are usually fast-moving and difficult to see. Stay tuned to
NOAA Weather Radio, weather.gov, or other media for watches and
warnings. A tornado watch means that conditions are favorable
for tornadoes to form during the next several hours. If a tornado
warning is issued for your area, move to a place of safety,
ideally in a basement or interior room on the lowest floor of a
sturdy building.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0146 AM CST Sun Dec 29 2024

Valid 301200Z - 311200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR EASTERN NEW MEXICO...WESTERN
TEXAS/TEXAS PANHANDLE...FAR WESTERN OKLAHOMA PANHANDLE...

...Synopsis...
Enhanced westerly flow aloft will overspread the central/southern
Rockies through the base of a mid-level shortwave moving across the
central/southern Plains on D2/Monday. Resulting surface cyclogenesis
and strengthening lee troughing will lead to an increase in westerly
surface winds across portions of the southern High Plains. This will
support a broad region of Elevated to Critical fire weather concerns
across areas from southeastern Colorado to the Oklahoma Panhandle
and into New Mexico and Texas.

...Eastern New Mexico, Texas/Oklahoma Panhandle, Western Texas...
Warm/dry/gusty westerly downslope flow is expected across eastern
New Mexico into western Texas/Oklahoma Monday. Afternoon
relative-humidity reductions to around 10-20 percent (driest across
portions of western Texas) will overlap surface winds sustained
around 20-25 mph. Fuels within this region have seen drying over the
last several days. While latest fuel guidance suggests 100-hr fuels
are largely marginal, the extended period of critical winds and
relative humidity should lead to further drying (especially of fine
fuels), supporting risk for fire spread. The previous D3 70 percent
was converted to a Critical area to support this risk.

Mesoscale Discussion 2297
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0838 AM CST Sat Dec 28 2024

Areas affected...portions of central Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 281438Z - 281615Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...The severe threat is increasing across central portions of
Texas. Severe wind and hail appear to be the predominant threats
with the stronger storms that develop, though a tornado or two
cannot be ruled out. A WW issuance may be needed in the next couple
of hours.

DISCUSSION...The boundary layer is expected to gradually warm
through the morning (given diurnal heating), where upper 60s F
surface dewpoints are in place. 7 C/km mid-level lapse rates and
deep-layer ascent are overspreading central TX in tandem with the
mid-level trough and associated 70-90 kt upper-level jet streak. As
such, thunderstorms are already developing along a Bosque-Kendall
County line ahead of the cold front, and they should continue to
gradually organize/intensify further throughout the morning. 50+ kt
effective bulk shear is already present over the warm sector, and
shear (as well as boundary-layer based buoyancy) should only
increase with time. 

Supercells are possible within this developing band of storms, as
well as with any storms that can develop and mature ahead of the
line, as suggested by high-resolution model guidance. Given
relatively steep lapse rates amid curved and elongated hodographs,
severe hail and wind are likely with the stronger storms. Low-level
hodographs are not particularly large (evident via the GRK VAD).
However, given rich low-level moisture and strong deep-layer
forcing/shear, a tornado or two cannot be ruled out, especially with
any sustained supercell preceding the main line of storms. A WW
issuance will likely be needed over the next hour or so.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1131 AM CST Fri Dec 27 2024

Valid 281200Z - 291200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM PORTIONS
OF EAST TEXAS...THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY INTO THE
TENNESSEE VALLEY...

...SUMMARY...
A regional outbreak of severe storms, with large hail, damaging
winds, and strong tornadoes is possible Saturday into Saturday
night, from East Texas, across the Lower Mississippi Valley, into
parts of the Tennessee Valley.

...Synopsis...
Mid-level flow is expected to rapidly amplify over the southern
CONUS Saturday, as several southern stream perturbations intensify
as they move near the Gulf Coast. A prominent shortwave trough,
initial located across the southern OH Valley, will quickly eject
northward as a second stronger shortwave approaches from the
southern Plains vicinity. A roughly east-west oriented warm front
will quickly move inland overnight Friday and into early Saturday in
response to increased mid-level height falls and a deepening surface
low near the Red River. This will allow for robust moisture return,
with upper 60s to low 70s F dewpoints likely across the lower MS
Valley by daybreak. While clouds and precipitation from inland
moisture advection may complicate destabilization to some degree,
sufficient buoyancy is expected to support numerous strong to severe
storms with all hazards possible from East TX and the lower MS
valley, into the TN valley from Saturday morning into early Sunday.

...East TX, Lower MS Valley...
As the mid-level flow pattern quickly amplifies Saturday, the
prominent shortwave trough and a subtle lead wave over the southern
plains should rapidly strengthen, taking on neutral to slightly
negative tilts by 00z Sunday. As this occurs, increasingly strong
diffluent flow aloft will overspread East Texas toward the ArkLaMiss
vicinity, where middle 60s F surface dewpoints will become more
common. Steepening low/mid-level lapse rates and diurnal heating
should allow for moderate destabilization, despite some lingering
clouds and isolated elevated storms.

Deeper convection is expected to develop early in the period
(11-14z) as ascent from the embedded perturbation and main trough
move over a pre-frontal confluence axis across East TX/Western LA. A
second round of robust convection may also develop across eastern TX
later in the afternoon as a Pacific front associated with the
surface low over North TX impinges on the warm sector from the west.
A mix of semi-discrete supercells and linearly organized bowing
segments are expected with sufficient buoyancy/deep-layer shear
overlap for storm organization. An initial risk for large hail,
especially where low-level flow is somewhat veered, should
transition to a risk for damaging winds and tornadoes as 0-1 km SRH
increases to 150-300 m2/s2 into mid/late Saturday afternoon with a
35+ kt 850 mb low-level jet.

Convection should quickly spread northeast into the lower MS Valley,
peaking in intensity through the afternoon and early evening hours.
Coincident with an increase in the low-level jet to 45-65 kt and
intensifying surface pressure falls, low-level hodographs will
expand with 0-1 km SRH of 300-400 m2/s2 likely. This will support
the potential for strong tornadoes with any established
suppercellular elements.

...Tennessee Valley and Cumberland Plateau...
As the upper trough continues to amplify through the day, the warm
front will gradually lift north into the southern TN valley by early
afternoon. A broad area of cloud cover and perhaps light stratiform
precipitation is expected in the presence of strong isentropic
ascent along the advancing warm front. This remains the primary
uncertainty regarding the northern/eastern extent of the
surface-based severe risk later Saturday afternoon into Saturday
night. While buoyancy/destabilization may be muted, the intensifying
upper trough and surface low will favor very strong low and
mid-level wind fields supportive of storm organization into Saturday
evening and early Sunday. With very large low-level hodographs (0-1
km SRH 300-500 m2/s2) weakly buoyant near-surface based parcels will
still allow for some tornado and or damaging wind risk into the
overnight hours, especially with any established supercell or bowing
structures across parts of AL, TN and western GA.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The forecast is on track. Some gusty winds are possible across parts
of the southern High Plains this afternoon along with low RH.
However, above average fuel moisture in the region should preclude a
significant fire threat. See the previous discussion for further
details.

..Supinie.. 12/27/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1231 AM CST Fri Dec 27 2024/

...Synopsis...
Enhanced westerly flow across the central/southern Rockies will lead
to a dry/warm downslope flow regime across the southern High Plains
this afternoon. Relative-humidity reductions to 15-25 percent will
overlap with sustained winds around 10-15 mph (gusting 20-30,
locally higher across the higher elevations). Latest guidance
suggests fuels in this region will largely not be receptive to fire
spread, precluding the need to include any areas at this time.

Valid 271630Z - 281200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON
AND EVENING FROM SOUTHEAST LA/MS INTO SOUTHWEST AL AND THE WESTERN
FL PANHANDLE...

...SUMMARY...
A few strong to locally severe thunderstorms could occur today
across parts of the central Gulf Coast States.

...Central Gulf Coast Region...
A compact negative-tilted shortwave trough that has provided
occasionally strong thunderstorms to parts of southern MS/southeast
LA is tracking away from the Gulf Coast region.  Low-level winds are
slowly veering/decreasing with time, suggesting the threat of
supercell structures and associated severe threat is marginal
through mid-afternoon.  

Another strong upper trough that is now over north TX will graze the
same area late this afternoon, possibly resulting in a
re-invigoration of convection across southeast MS and southwest AL. 
The air mass has been slow to recover, with mid 60s dewpoints
restricted to areas just a few rows of counties inland.  Widespread
clouds will also limit destabilization.  Locally gusty winds or a
brief tornado will remain possible with this renewed early evening
activity, but the overall threat appears marginal.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0410 AM CST Thu Dec 26 2024

Valid 291200Z - 031200Z

...DISCUSSION...
At least some severe-weather risk is expected on Sunday/Day 4 across
the Southeast States as an upper trough shifts east-northeastward
from the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys toward the Appalachians. Very strong
deep-layer winds will overspread the region, but guidance
variability exists regarding the availability and
north-northeastward extent of minimal buoyancy, especially with
GFS/ECMWF-related guidance depicting the possibility of considerable
scattered convection ongoing Sunday morning. Regional areas
including northern Florida into southern/eastern Georgia and parts
of the Carolinas will continue to be reevaluated in subsequent
outlooks as far as Sunday's severe potential, but at least
some/low-end severe risk seems probable even with these instability
uncertainties.

Thereafter, severe-weather potential early next week is currently
expected to remain low.
