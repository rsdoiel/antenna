Mesoscale Discussion 2166
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0345 PM CDT Wed Oct 30 2024

Areas affected...southern Kansas and northwest/central/northern
Oklahoma.

Concerning...Tornado Watch 694...

Valid 302045Z - 302215Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 694 continues.

SUMMARY...The large hail/severe wind threat is expected to continue
through the afternoon as supercells move across northwest Oklahoma
and into southern Kansas. The tornado threat is expected to increase
this evening.

DISCUSSION...Supercells have developed along the dryline in western
Oklahoma. Thus far, one measured wind gust of 70 mph has been
observed with MRMS MESH suggesting around 1 to 1.25 inch hail. As
these supercells mature, expect the threat for large hail and severe
wind gusts to continue. Low-level shear is quite weak this afternoon
(60-70 m2/s2 0-500 SRH per VNX VWP), but is forecast to increase
substantially after 22-23Z as the low-level jet strengthens. During
this time is when the greatest tornado threat is anticipated.
Eventually, expect storms to congeal into a squall line with severe
wind and a few embedded QLCS tornadoes as the primary threat.

Mesoscale Discussion 2165
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0305 PM CDT Wed Oct 30 2024

Areas affected...Southern Iowa and far northern Missouri

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 693...

Valid 302005Z - 302200Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 693
continues.

SUMMARY...A line of storms will continue to pose a risk of damaging
winds across southern Iowa and far northern Missouri over the next
few hours. However, downstream watch issuance is not currently
anticipated given recent convective trends.

DISCUSSION...An organized bowing segment with a history of producing
severe winds continues to migrate across south-central IA. However,
a decrease in vertically integrated ice, VIL, and echo top height
has been noted over the past 30 minutes, suggesting that the severe
wind threat may be decreasing in spatial extent and/or intensity to
some degree. This is likely attributable to the QLCS meandering into
a slightly more stable air mass where daytime heating has been muted
due to preceding clouds and light rain. Despite these trends,
gradual destabilization continues immediately downstream of the line
and ahead of the cold front due to strong low-level warm/moist
advection with MLCAPE estimates up to 500 J/kg per mesoanalysis and
RAP forecast soundings. The combination of modest
destabilization/ascent and favorable deep-layer, line-orthogonal
wind shear may maintain the severe wind threat downstream through
the remainder of WW 693. Additional watch issuance into
southeast/eastern IA remains uncertain and will be conditional on
convective trends over the next 1-2 hours.

Mesoscale Discussion 2164
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0303 PM CDT Wed Oct 30 2024

Areas affected...northeast Kansas into southeast Nebraska and far
northwest Missouri

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 302003Z - 302200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Airmass recovery should result in some severe storms this
afternoon and evening.

DISCUSSION...Widespread showers and thunderstorms across northeast
Kansas has stunted destabilization thus far. However, some clearing
and low-level moisture advection in the wake of the morning activity
has started to destabilize parts of northeast Kansas. A line of
storms is starting to organize across central Kansas which is
expected to continue to grow upscale as it moves northeast. Expect
sufficient destabilization ahead of this line of storms for some
threat for severe wind gusts, large hail, and potentially a few
tornadoes (along and south of the front). A tornado watch will
likely need to be issued within the next hour or two across
northeast Kansas, to fill the gap between watch 693 and 694.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 693
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
130 PM CDT Wed Oct 30 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Southern/Central Iowa
  Extreme Northeast Kansas
  Northern Missouri

* Effective this Wednesday afternoon and evening from 130 PM
  until 700 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging winds likely with isolated significant gusts
    to 80 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...A bowing thunderstorm cluster will likely continue to pose
a threat for scattered severe/damaging winds potentially up to 70-80
mph as it continues east-northeastward across northern Missouri and
southern/central Iowa this afternoon and early evening. Isolated
hail and perhaps a tornado may also occur.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 60
statute miles north and south of a line from 50 miles north

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0254 PM CDT Wed Oct 30 2024

Valid 302000Z - 311200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS
NORTHERN/CENTRAL OKLAHOMA INTO CENTRAL/EASTERN KANSAS AND WESTERN
MISSOURI...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms capable of producing scattered large hail,
numerous damaging wind gusts, and a few tornadoes are expected today
into tonight across the middle Missouri Valley and central/southern
Plains, including parts of eastern Kansas/Oklahoma into Missouri and
vicinity. A strong tornado or two is possible across
south-central/southeastern Kansas into central Oklahoma.

...20z Update...
The Enhanced Risk was expanded further southward through the
Oklahoma City metro with this update. The Slight Risk was also
expanded further west and southward. Recent trends in satellite and
radar have shown cell development further south and west along the
dryline than previously forecast. The environment across central
Oklahoma is favorable for maintenance of supercells, with daytime
heating yielding MLCAPE around 1500 J/kg and shear around 40 kts
progged to increase with the increasing low level jet this
afternoon/evening. Boundary parallel shear and overtaking of the
dryline by the cold front will lead to a transition to more linear
structure around sunset. However, deep layer shear profiles will
continue to support embedded supercell structures after dark with
the potential for tornadoes, some strong, to continue through the
evening. Large hail will also be a concern late afternoon/early
evening while discrete mode is maintained.

Tornado probabilities were adjusted across northeastern Kansas to
account for progression of the cold front and earlier convective
activity. See previous discussion for more information.

..Thornton/Gleason.. 10/30/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1130 AM CDT Wed Oct 30 2024/

...Southern/Central Plains into the Mid Missouri Valley...
The lead portion of an upper trough centered over the Rockies and
Four Corners will eject northeastward over the central Plains today.
A related surface low will likewise develop northeastward along a
cold front from the southern High Plains to IA by this evening. A
dryline extending southward from this low will mix eastward across
western OK and west TX through late this afternoon before stalling.
Robust low-level warm/moist advection will continue today across the
southern/central Plains along and south/east of the cold front and
dryline. Generally elevated thunderstorms have developed this
morning across parts of central KS, as large-scale ascent preceding
the ejecting upper trough has begun to overspread the central
Plains. This activity should tend to remain just to the cool side of
the front through the early afternoon. But, this convection may pose
some threat for severe hail given sufficient MUCAPE with steepening
mid-level lapse rates in the presence of strong deep-layer shear.
There is also some chance it eventually becomes surface based later
this afternoon across northeast KS.

Otherwise, continued filtered daytime heating of the moistening warm
sector should support around 500-1500 J/kg of MLCAPE by late
afternoon from southern IA into eastern KS/western MO, and locally
stronger to around 2000 J/kg in north-central OK. Current
expectations are for surface-based thunderstorms to initiate by
20-22Z across central/eastern KS and north-central/northwest OK, in
close proximity to the surface low and front/dryline intersection.
Rather strong (50-80 kt) southwesterly mid-level flow will overlie
this region this afternoon/evening, along with enhanced
south-southwesterly flow in the 850-700 mb layer. Related deep-layer
shear around 45-60 kt will easily support supercells and associated
threat for scattered hail initially. Isolated very large hail may
occur from south-central KS into north-central OK with any sustained
supercell given the rather favorable overlap of moderate instability
with steepened mid-level lapse rates and strong deep-layer shear.

With time this evening, upscale growth into a QLCS with greater
threat for severe/damaging winds is anticipated. This
severe/damaging wind threat should continue tonight as the line
spreads eastward across IA/MO, before eventually becoming more
isolated/diminishing with eastward extent into the mid MS Valley.
The tornado potential should also increase late this afternoon and
evening, as a southerly low-level jet and related 0-1 km SRH
strengthens rapidly through 23-04Z. The potential for sustained
supercells in central/eastern KS and north-central OK remains
somewhat unclear, but any semi-discrete activity will pose a threat
for tornadoes, a couple of which could be strong given the favorable
low-level shear and hodograph curvature. Embedded mesovorticies
within the QLCS will also be possible. Based on latest guidance and
observational trends, severe probabilities have been expanded
westward some across KS/OK, especially in the vicinity of the
expected front/dryline intersection. The Enhanced Risk has also been
expanded slightly eastward in western MO to account for scattered to
numerous severe wind gusts with the QLCS this evening.

Convective initiation may be delayed until around 00Z or later
across central/eastern OK. But, potential for discrete supercells
may be a bit better across this region given the dryline as the
initiating boundary, and somewhat less large-scale ascent with
southward extent away from the cold front. Any convection that can
develop and be sustained will likely be supercellular for at least a
couple of hours this evening, before upscale growth eventually
occurs along the cold front. A threat for large hail and tornadoes
will exist with any supercell, before the damaging wind threat
increases as the convective mode becomes more linear.

...Southeast Texas...
There is some potential that a few stronger/potentially rotating
thunderstorms could materialize today across the region within a
very moist and confluent low-level flow regime. This would be as
low-level lapse rates diurnally steepen coincident with a moderate
degree of low-level hodograph length and curvature. Modest-strength
winds above 2km AGL should limit the sustainability and intensity
for any showers/thunderstorms that may exhibit rotating
characteristics, and the overall severe potential should tend to
remain limited.

Valid 311200Z - 011200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No changes to the ongoing forecast.

..Wendt.. 10/30/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0204 AM CDT Wed Oct 30 2024/

...Synopsis...
As the upper trough continues eastward, the attendant surface
cyclone and cold front will move through the central US with
thunderstorms and widespread precipitation ahead of it. Behind the
front, high pressure and a cooler air mass will quickly develop over
the Rockies and High Plains. Mid-level flow will slacken as the
pattern evolves towards broad zonal flow and weak Pacific troughing.
This should reduce the coverage of strong winds and low RH over much
of the CONUS Thursday. 

One exception to this may be across portions of the Southwest. Here,
mid-level flow will remain somewhat stronger, but the strongest
winds are expected to overlap with only modestly low RH and
relatively poor fuels given recent precipitation. Thus, critical
fire-weather conditions appear unlikely.

0218 PM CDT Wed Oct 30 2024

Valid 011200Z - 021200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE
SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
A few strong storms capable of producing marginal hail are expected
to develop Friday night over the southern High Plain region.

...Synopsis...
Amplification of the upper flow field across the western and central
U.S. is forecast, as mid-level short-wave energy on the western side
of a low near Vancouver Island digs south-southeastward across the
eastern Pacific toward California.  This will result in
amplification of cyclonic flow over the West and, in response,
increased ridging/anticyclonic flow over the central states.  

At the surface, high pressure will prevail in the wake of a cold
front expected to move eastward across New England through the day,
while trailing west-to-east across the Carolinas and Gulf Coast
States, and into the southern Plains.

Meanwhile over the West, a cold front is forecast to advance across
the northwestern states and eventually into the Great Basin, in
response to the digging upper system.

...Southern High Plains...
Development of scattered/elevated storms is expected overnight
across the southern High Plains area, within a zone of low-level
warm advection near and north of the remnant surface baroclinic
zone.  Rather steep lapse rates aloft will contribute to ample CAPE,
while moderate southwesterly mid-level flow will allow sufficient
cloud-layer shear for a few stronger updrafts.  This suggests
potential for hail near or in excess of severe levels with these
potentially stronger storms.

Valid 311200Z - 011200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM SOUTHERN
LOWER MICHIGAN SOUTHWESTWARD TO NORTHEASTERN TEXAS/NORTHERN
LOUISIANA...

...SUMMARY...
Locally strong storms -- a couple of which may produce marginally
severe gusts -- will be possible Thursday morning and afternoon,
from the Midwest to northeastern Texas/northern Louisiana.

...Synopsis...
A progressing short-wave trough initially forecast over the Middle
Missouri Valley area is expected to move quickly northeastward
toward/across the Great Lakes region through the first half of the
period, and then into Ontario/Quebec overnight.  At the surface, an
associated cold front will move eastward across the Great Lakes and
Ohio Valley areas, while moving more slowly southeastward across the
Lower Mississippi Valley and southern Plains.  By the end of the
period, the boundary should extend from the Northeast to the Texas
Coast.

...Southern Lower Michigan southwest to northeastern Texas/northern
Louisiana...
Showers and thunderstorms will be ongoing near and ahead of an
advancing cold front -- which is initially forecast to lie from the
southern Wisconsin vicinity southwestward to central Texas.  With
the associated upper system forecast to be ejecting quickly
northeastward into/across the Upper Great Lakes region, decreasing
ascent and weakening flow aloft is expected with time from roughly
the Ohio Valley southward.  Meanwhile, weak instability north of the
Ohio Valley will be an overall limiting factor, despite more
favorable kinematics.

Overall, it appears that Level 1/MRGL risk remains appropriate, to
cover the potential for a few stronger storms/line segments to
produce strong/gusty winds that may locally reach severe levels. 
Risk should be greatest during the morning and afternoon hours,
after which decreasing convective intensity and attendant severe
potential is expected.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF TEXAS/OKLAHOMA PANHANDLES
INTO FAR NORTHWEST OKLAHOMA...

Minor modifications were made to the elevated area in Kansas based
on the current frontal position and expected surface low track this
afternoon. The forecast is otherwise on track. See the previous
discussion for additional details.

..Wendt.. 10/30/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0203 AM CDT Wed Oct 30 2024/

...Synopsis...
A strong upper trough will intensify further as it ejects eastward
over the central US today and tonight. Strong mid-level flow will
accompany the trough, deepening a lee low over parts of CO/KS. The
low will move northeast along a cold front across KS and OK, drawing
an unusually moist air mass northward across the eastern Plains. To
the west, dry and breezy conditions are likely over parts of TX and
western OK, as well as the Midwest and Great Lakes. Elevated to
critical fire-weather conditions are possible.

...Southern Plains...
As the upper trough ejects eastward a 70-80 kt mid-level jet will
round the base of the trough over the southern and central High
Plains. West of a lee low and intensifying dryline, downslope winds
of 25-35 mph are likely across much of the eastern Panhandle and
western OK. Aided by mid-level subsidence and unusually warm
temperatures in the mid to upper 80s F, afternoon RH values of 8-15%
are expected through peak heating. The overlap of several hours of
hot, dry and windy conditions over very dry fuels lends higher
confidence in sustained critical fire-weather conditions this
afternoon. Additionally, the cold front trailing the low will pass
over the High Plains later this evening. A notable wind shift to
north/northwesterly is expected after 00z. Strong winds could
continue into the overnight hours exacerbating fire concerns despite
increasing RH.

...Great Lakes...
Dry and windy conditions are possible ahead of the deepening trough
over parts of the Great Lakes and Midwest today. While RH values
should steadily increase as moisture advects northward, sustained
southerly winds near 15-20 mph will overlap with extremely dry
fuels. While clouds and the increasing moisture should limit
marginal RH, a few hours of locally elevated fire-weather conditions
are possible this afternoon given the strong winds and unusually dry
fuels.

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
NORTHERN OKLAHOMA INTO CENTRAL/EASTERN KANSAS AND WESTERN
MISSOURI...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms capable of producing scattered large hail,
numerous damaging wind gusts, and a few tornadoes are expected today
into tonight across the middle Missouri Valley and central/southern
Plains, including parts of eastern Kansas/Oklahoma into Missouri and
vicinity.

...Southern/Central Plains into the Mid Missouri Valley...
The lead portion of an upper trough centered over the Rockies and
Four Corners will eject northeastward over the central Plains today.
A related surface low will likewise develop northeastward along a
cold front from the southern High Plains to IA by this evening. A
dryline extending southward from this low will mix eastward across
western OK and west TX through late this afternoon before stalling.
Robust low-level warm/moist advection will continue today across the
southern/central Plains along and south/east of the cold front and
dryline. Generally elevated thunderstorms have developed this
morning across parts of central KS, as large-scale ascent preceding
the ejecting upper trough has begun to overspread the central
Plains. This activity should tend to remain just to the cool side of
the front through the early afternoon. But, this convection may pose
some threat for severe hail given sufficient MUCAPE with steepening
mid-level lapse rates in the presence of strong deep-layer shear.
There is also some chance it eventually becomes surface based later
this afternoon across northeast KS.

Otherwise, continued filtered daytime heating of the moistening warm
sector should support around 500-1500 J/kg of MLCAPE by late
afternoon from southern IA into eastern KS/western MO, and locally
stronger to around 2000 J/kg in north-central OK. Current
expectations are for surface-based thunderstorms to initiate by
20-22Z across central/eastern KS and north-central/northwest OK, in
close proximity to the surface low and front/dryline intersection.
Rather strong (50-80 kt) southwesterly mid-level flow will overlie
this region this afternoon/evening, along with enhanced
south-southwesterly flow in the 850-700 mb layer. Related deep-layer
shear around 45-60 kt will easily support supercells and associated
threat for scattered hail initially. Isolated very large hail may
occur from south-central KS into north-central OK with any sustained
supercell given the rather favorable overlap of moderate instability
with steepened mid-level lapse rates and strong deep-layer shear.

With time this evening, upscale growth into a QLCS with greater
threat for severe/damaging winds is anticipated. This
severe/damaging wind threat should continue tonight as the line
spreads eastward across IA/MO, before eventually becoming more
isolated/diminishing with eastward extent into the mid MS Valley.
The tornado potential should also increase late this afternoon and
evening, as a southerly low-level jet and related 0-1 km SRH
strengthens rapidly through 23-04Z. The potential for sustained
supercells in central/eastern KS and north-central OK remains
somewhat unclear, but any semi-discrete activity will pose a threat
for tornadoes, a couple of which could be strong given the favorable
low-level shear and hodograph curvature. Embedded mesovorticies
within the QLCS will also be possible. Based on latest guidance and
observational trends, severe probabilities have been expanded
westward some across KS/OK, especially in the vicinity of the
expected front/dryline intersection. The Enhanced Risk has also been
expanded slightly eastward in western MO to account for scattered to
numerous severe wind gusts with the QLCS this evening.

Convective initiation may be delayed until around 00Z or later
across central/eastern OK. But, potential for discrete supercells
may be a bit better across this region given the dryline as the
initiating boundary, and somewhat less large-scale ascent with
southward extent away from the cold front. Any convection that can
develop and be sustained will likely be supercellular for at least a
couple of hours this evening, before upscale growth eventually
occurs along the cold front. A threat for large hail and tornadoes
will exist with any supercell, before the damaging wind threat
increases as the convective mode becomes more linear.

...Southeast Texas...
There is some potential that a few stronger/potentially rotating
thunderstorms could materialize today across the region within a
very moist and confluent low-level flow regime. This would be as
low-level lapse rates diurnally steepen coincident with a moderate
degree of low-level hodograph length and curvature. Modest-strength
winds above 2km AGL should limit the sustainability and intensity
for any showers/thunderstorms that may exhibit rotating
characteristics, and the overall severe potential should tend to
remain limited.

Mesoscale Discussion 2161
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0907 AM CDT Wed Oct 30 2024

Areas affected...central/northern Kansas into southeast Nebraska

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 301407Z - 301530Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Elevated storms capable of some large hail are possible
this morning from portions of central Kansas into southeast
Nebraska.

DISCUSSION...Lightning has increased across central Kansas as ascent
increases across the Plains within a moderately unstable
environment. The TOP 12Z RAOB indicated around 1300 J/kg MUCAPE and
continued low-level moisture advection and mid-level cooling should
increase instability as the morning progresses. Effective shear was
actually quite weak at 12Z with a 60 knot low-level jet near the
low-level jet and 60 knots at 7km with weaker flow between this
layer. However, as the mid-level jet streak approaches the region
and nocturnal influences of the low-level jet reduce, a more
favorable, gradually increasing wind profile with height is expected
to develop by late morning to early afternoon. As instability and
the wind profile improve, eventually expect some supercells to
develop along or slightly on the cool side of the cold front.
Isolated large hail will be the primary threat from this activity
later this morning and into the early afternoon. A watch likely will
not be needed in the short term.

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR PORTIONS
EASTERN KANSAS...NORTHEAST OKLAHOMA...AND NORTHWEST MISSOURI...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms capable of producing large hail, damaging wind
gusts, and a few tornadoes, are expected today into tonight across
the middle Missouri Valley and central/southern Plains, including
parts of eastern Kansas and Oklahoma into Missouri.

...Lower Missouri Valley/South-Central Plains...
A relatively active severe-weather day is expected regionally,
especially late this afternoon into evening, including some southern
Plains areas in which there hasn't been severe-weather potential in
over a month.

The lead portion of an upper-level trough centered over the
central/southern Rockies this morning will eject northeastward over
the central Plains toward broader parts of the Upper Midwest and
Corn Belt. A surface wave will evolve across the eastern Texas
Panhandle/northwest Oklahoma vicinity. From this low, an
east/southeastward-moving cold front will extend across Kansas into
Iowa/Minnesota and eventually Wisconsin/western Missouri by this
evening, with this front overtaking a dryline across the southern
High Plains.

Some severe-weather potential may increase as early as late morning
into midday near the cold front across central Kansas into southeast
Nebraska and Iowa, with a likely increase in surface-rooted
convection and greater severe potential by mid/late afternoon as the
front approaches east-central/northeast Kansas and northwest
Missouri/southern Iowa. Pre-convective MLCAPE values should reach
500-1250 J/kg within this corridor, with very strong deep-layer
southwesterly winds supporting 40-50 kt effective shear and fast
east-northeastward storm motions, which will largely parallel the
front and its east-southeastward motion. Some severe hail will be
possible during the day, but damaging winds and some tornado
potential will be more prevalent into late afternoon and evening as
a QLCS evolves with embedded bowing segments and potential
mesovortices. 

Farther south, in closer proximity to the surface wave, somewhat
more discrete thunderstorm development is expected across
south-central/east-central Kansas including the I-35/135 corridors
and north-central Oklahoma, with prospects for even more isolated
initial supercellular development by around sunset southward into
central/southern Oklahoma and North Texas. Surface temperatures in
the upper 70s F, combined with mid 60s F dewpoints, will contribute
to 1500-2000 J/kg MLCAPE by peak heating. Storms that develop/mature
in this environment will likely be supercells in the presence of 45+
effective shear, highlighted by a dramatic strengthening (50-65 kt)
of 2-3 km AGL (surface-700 mb) southwesterly winds toward/after
sunset. Storm mergers will result in squall line development over
time, with a longer duration of more discrete development with
southward extent across Oklahoma. A few tornadoes are plausible
regionally, and a strong tornado or two could occur, particularly
within a couple of hours of sunset. The severe threat should
transition to more of a damaging wind threat as the squall line
matures, although line-embedded QLCS tornadoes will remain possible
this evening, and possibly overnight.

...Southeast Texas...
There is some potential that a few stronger/potentially rotating
storms could materialize today across the region within a very moist
and confluent low-level flow regime. This would be as low-level
lapse rates diurnally steepen coincident with a moderate degree of
low-level hodograph length and curvature. Modest-strength winds
above 2km AGL should limit the sustainability and intensity for any
showers/thunderstorms that may exhibit rotating characteristics, and
the overall severe potential should remain limited.

...DISCUSSION...
...Thursday/Day 4 to Saturday/Day 6...
An upper-level trough is forecast to move eastward into the upper
Mississippi Valley on Thursday, and into the Northeast on Friday. At
the surface, a cold front is forecast to advance southeastward into
the Gulf Coast states. Thunderstorm development will be likely near
and ahead of the front Thursday afternoon and evening. Weak
instability and limited large-scale ascent should keep any severe
threat marginal.

From Friday into Saturday, low-level moisture return is expected to
take place further west into the southern Plains. Thunderstorms are
forecast to develop on Friday over parts of eastern New Mexico and
west Texas, with an isolated severe threat possible. On Saturday,
moisture and instability is forecast to increase across the southern
and central Plains, which could result in an expansion of severe
threat coverage. However, the latest models suggest that instability
will be relatively weak in most areas, helping to marginalize the
severe threat.

...Sunday/Day 7 and Monday/Day 8...
On Sunday and Monday, an upper-level system is forecast to move from
near the southern California coast into northwestern Mexico. Ahead
of the system, an anticyclonic and subtle southwesterly mid-level
flow pattern is forecast in the south-central U.S, where a moist
airmass should be located. Isolated to scattered thunderstorms are
expected to develop on both Sunday and Monday afternoons with this
airmass. The strongest instability is forecast to be near the
western edge of the moist airmass, suggesting the greatest severe
potential could be from west Texas extending north-northeastward
into the central Plains. Forecast instability should be relatively
weak, keeping any severe threat marginal.
