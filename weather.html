Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1021 AM CST Fri Jan 26 2024

Valid 261630Z - 271200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS PRE-DAWN
SATURDAY MORNING OVER PORTIONS OF LOUISIANA AND SOUTHERN
MISSISSIPPI....

...SUMMARY...
Isolated strong to severe thunderstorms are possible early Saturday
morning over parts of Louisiana and southern Mississippi.

...Southeast states today...
Recent radar and satellite imagery shows multiple clusters of
showers and thunderstorms occurring over the central Gulf of Mexico.
This activity will continue through the day, with only weak forcing
and minimal destabilization occurring inland across the Gulf coast
states and Carolinas.  Isolated thunderstorms are possible in this
area, but coverage is expected to be quite limited.

...LA/MS early Saturday morning...
Later in the forecast period, strong low-level cyclogenesis is
forecast across the Arklatex region as the primary upper trough
approaches from the west.  Strengthening low-level wind fields will
enhance warm advection and lift, resulting in scattered
thunderstorms after midnight.  Morning model guidance suggests the
potential for the intensification/organization of a line of
convection along the strengthening cold front over LA/MS after 09z. 
Forecast soundings indicate near-surface-based convection and strong
vertical shear profiles - posing some risk of gusty/damaging winds
or perhaps a tornado after 09z.  Therefore have added a small MRGL
risk area to cover this scenario.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0947 AM CST Fri Jan 26 2024

Valid 261700Z - 271200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No changes are needed. The previous forecast (below) remains on
track based on morning observations and latest guidance.

..Moore.. 01/26/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1150 PM CST Thu Jan 25 2024/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough will strengthen as it ejects into the southern
Plains today. Ahead of a surface cold front, westerly winds within
the Trans-Pecos/Big Bend will increase. Marginal RH reductions to
around 20% in some areas is possible. Fire weather concerns should
still remain minimal given generally unfavorable fuels.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0647 AM CST Fri Jan 26 2024

Valid 261300Z - 271200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated strong thunderstorms are possible this afternoon over parts
of west Texas, and tonight near the central Gulf Coast and over
Louisiana.  Organized severe weather appears improbable.

...Synopsis...
The mid/upper-level pattern will remain progressive over the CONUS
this period, with a trough now over CO and NM being the main
convective influence aloft.  This perturbation will house an
intermittently closed 500-mb low -- initially over east-central/
northeastern NM.  That low should move roughly eastward across the
southern High Plains today, reaching the Caprock Escarpment between
LBB-CDS around 00Z, then moving roughly down the Red River Valley to
near I-35 in southern OK or extreme north-central TX by 12Z
tomorrow.  By that time, the positively tilted trough should extend
from there southwestward to northern Coahuila. 

At the surface, a broad, wavy baroclinic zone was analyzed across
the northern Gulf, modulated on the mesoscale by convective
boundaries.  This feature should shift north but still remain mostly
offshore through the period, except for some warm-frontal incursion
into the MS/AL/western FL Panhandle region possible near the end of
the period.  This would occur southeast of frontal-wave low
development over the northwest Gulf, offshore from the TX Coast, in
response to the approaching mid/upper trough.  The low should move
northeastward close to a LCH-JAN track overnight, with a synoptic
warm front/inverted trough northeastward into the southern
Appalachians.  

...West TX...
An organized thunderstorm or two may move southeastward across the
southern South Plains and/or northern Permian Basin regions of west
TX this afternoon, with potential for strong gusts and/or hail
approaching severe limits.  Though surface temperatures will remain
cool over this region today (50s to low 60s in general), cooling
aloft with the approaching trough will steepen low/middle-level
lapse rates enough to support isolated strong convection, amid
30-40-kt effective-shear magnitudes.  Inflow-layer parcels may even
become briefly surface-based, depending on cloud breaks and
insolation duration locally, with MLCAPE in the 300-700 J/kg range
possible along the southern rim of the cold-core region.  Lack of
more-substantial inflow-layer moisture/buoyancy should preclude an
organized/areal severe threat.

...Gulf Coast States...
Strong convection is evident over open Gulf waters south of LA, in
IR satellite pictures, lightning data and imagery from distantly
located radar(s), with an extensive area of downstream anvil
material and precip from that also being shown in radar composites. 
This precip may be under-depicted in composites, given the
unavailability of the closest (former Slidell) radar while it is
being relocated westward.  This convection, being surface-based over
a well-modified and relatively high-theta-e boundary layer, is
likely to remain both organized and over the Gulf through the day
and into much of tonight.  Meanwhile, a relatively stable boundary
layer to its north should be maintained and reinforced by:
1.  Its own continuing downshear precip plume, and
2.  Additional, widely scattered to scattered thunderstorms expected
to form over east TX and LA from this afternoon through tonight, as
elevated warm advection and moisture transport occur beneath
steepening midlevel lapse rates overnight.

Any sustained/discrete convection overnight in LA may produce hail
with MUCAPE up to about 1500 J/kg and 40-50-kt effective-shear
magnitude possible.  However, with a lack of elevated MUCINH
reasonably apparent in forecast soundings, storm mode may become
clustered/messy fairly quickly.  For now any severe-hail threat
appears too conditional/isolated for probabilities.  One area of
interest for the last few hours of the period may be the coastal
corridor around BIX-MOB-PNS, where theta-e advection may render
surface-based parcels if earlier convection and related boundaries
move away long enough beforehand.  For now the predictability of
such mesoscale processes remains too low to introduce unconditional
severe probabilities, but this potential will be monitored through
remaining outlook cycles.

Valid 222000Z - 231200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected.

...20Z Update...
Minor changes have been made to the general thunderstorm area, but
otherwise the previous outlook reasoning remains valid. See the
previous discussion below for more details. A few stronger storms
are possible this afternoon/evening near the upper TX coast, and
perhaps late tonight near the Edwards Plateau region, but the severe
threat still appears limited through the end of the period.

..Dean.. 01/22/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1036 AM CST Mon Jan 22 2024/

...South-central CONUS including coastal Texas...
Surface high pressure and cold stable conditions will exist over the
eastern half of the CONUS, but multiple low-amplitude mid-level
disturbances and a prevalent warm conveyor over the south-central
CONUS toward the Ozarks/Midwest will influence widespread showers
across that same region with continued elevated thunderstorm
potential especially across east/southeast Texas toward Louisiana
and the ArkLaTex. 

Weak surface-based destabilization should gradually occur near the
upper Texas coast, beginning this afternoon and more so tonight.
Within a favorable kinematic environment, a few stronger
near-surface-based storms could occur as early as this afternoon
across the upper Texas coast, but the overall severe thunderstorm
potential is still expected to remain low through tonight.

...Western States...
Showers and occasional lightning flashes will be possible from
portions of southwest Oregon and California into southern Arizona.
This convection will be associated with a pronounced mid-level
trough embedded within broader cyclonic flow, with steepening lapse
rates.

Mesoscale Discussion 0083
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0917 AM CST Mon Jan 22 2024

Areas affected...portions of eastern/northeastern IL...northern
IN...far southern MI and far northwest OH

Concerning...Freezing rain 

Valid 221517Z - 221915Z

SUMMARY...Light to moderate freezing rain is expected through the
morning hours with rates of 0.01-0.03 in/hr possible. Some
mixed-phase precipitation is also possible early.

DISCUSSION...As of 15 UTC, regional radar mosaic imagery and surface
observations showed a broad area of light to moderate wintry
precipitation across parts of northeastern IL. Over the last hour,
automated reports of unknown precipitation type and freezing rain
have gradually become more numerous as the precipitation has
expanded over an air mass with surface temperatures in the mid to
upper 20s F. Driven primarily by low-level warm advection, light to
moderate precipitation is expected to continue to move
east/northeast this morning. Light snow has been observed across
parts of southwest lower MI and northwest IN. However, observed and
modified model soundings show an elevated warm nose of 1-2 C between
1-2 km AGL will gradually advect northeastward over the next few
hours. While some snow and sleet are possible ahead of the main area
of precipitation, gradually deepening of the elevated warm layer to
near 600-800 m will favor a transition to predominately freezing
rain.

Rain rates of 0.01-0.03 in/hr are possible above favorable surface
temperatures for rapid ice accretion. The most likely corridor for
impactful freezing rain appears to be from northeastern IL into
northwest IN and far southwest lower MI through this morning. Hi-res
CAM guidance has been poor thus far in handling the evolution of the
precipitation field. While low-level warm advection may wane
slightly through the day, observed low and mid-level ascent appears
strong enough to continue to support precipitation into the early
afternoon. Given the cold surface temperatures and melting layer
aloft, freezing rain appears likely.
