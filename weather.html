Mesoscale Discussion 0742
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1229 PM CDT Thu May 08 2025

Areas affected...northern Florida...southeastern Georgia...far
southern South Carolina

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 081729Z - 081930Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Hail and damaging wind threat may increase through the
afternoon as thunderstorms develop along the sea breeze.

DISCUSSION...The air mass across southeastern Georgia and southern
South Carolina has warmed and destabilized through the morning and
early afternoon, with temperatures now in the 80s. Thunderstorms
have developed across southern South Carolina along a southward
moving remnant outflow boundary. 

Additional thunderstorm development is expected along the sea breeze
boundary through the afternoon. Deep layer shear will see some
increase to around 30-40 kts through the afternoon, with increasing
westerly flow aloft. A plume of steep lapse rates is in place across
this region, owing to cooling temperature aloft. Largely straight
hodographs and moderate to strong instability will support risk for
large hail and damaging wind with thunderstorm development. This
area will be monitored for possible watch issuance by mid to late
afternoon.

Mesoscale Discussion 0741
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1132 AM CDT Thu May 08 2025

Areas affected...Portions of far Western and South-Central Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 081632Z - 081830Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Storms capable of large to very large hail and severe
winds possible through the afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorm activity ongoing near the Trans Pecos and
Davis Mountains is showing an uptick in intensity over the last 30
minutes. Additionally, cumulus development further south across the
Texas Big Bend is noted on visible satellite. Further thunderstorm
development is expected this afternoon as a weak shortwave shifts
eastward and the current activity shifts south and eastward through
time. 

The environment across this region is characterized by MLCAPE around
500-1000 J/kg, steep low to mid-level lapse rates, and deep layer
shear 45-50 kts. Further daytime heating and moist advection will
lead to increase in instability through the afternoon. This regime
will support a mix of supercells and multi-cell clusters capable of
large to very large hail (some 2-2.5 in) and severe wind. There is
some uncertainty on when the most robust convection will develop
beyond the ongoing thunderstorms. This will be monitored for watch
potential this afternoon.

Mesoscale Discussion 0740
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1110 AM CDT Thu May 08 2025

Areas affected...the Mid Mississippi Valley to the Southern
Appalachians

Concerning...Severe potential...Severe Thunderstorm Watch likely 

Valid 081610Z - 081745Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Widespread thunderstorm development is expected this
afternoon with a threat for large hail and damaging wind gusts.

DISCUSSION...Cold temperatures aloft, associated with an eastward
meandering upper low, will provide a focus for widespread
thunderstorm development this afternoon from the Mid Mississippi
Valley to the southern Appalachians. Beneath this cold air aloft,
surface dewpoints are mostly in the mid 60s. This moisture will be
sufficient for moderate instability this afternoon (~1500 J/kg
MLCAPE) as temperatures warm into the mid 70s. A belt of moderate
(40 to 45 knots) of mid-level flow exists south of this upper low
and was apparent on the 12Z RAOB from KBNA and KLZK. This will
provide a sufficiently sheared environment for organized storms
including the potential for some rotating updrafts. This cold air
aloft, yielding moderately steep mid-level lapse rates, and
potential for some supercells will support a threat for large hail,
some of which could be 2+ inches. A remnant EML and dry air aloft,
combined with steep low-level lapse rates will also support a
damaging wind threat. In addition, the expectation for many storms
within the already uncapped airmass should promote storm clustering
which will also increase the damaging wind threat within those
corridors which clustering/bowing segments occur.

The 12Z BNA RAOB showed a convective temperature of 73F which has
nearly been reached as of 16Z. As such, a few storms have already
developed over southeast Missouri and northwest Tennessee where
cooler temperatures aloft are likely supporting a lower convective
temperature. As the boundary layer warms and mid-level temperatures
continue to cool, expect additional strong storm development within
the next 1 to 2 hours. Multiple severe thunderstorm watches will be
needed to address the threat from this development.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1211 PM CDT Thu May 08 2025

Valid 091200Z - 101200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM PARTS OF
THE GULF COAST STATES NORTHWARD INTO THE CAROLINAS...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms capable of damaging gusts and large
hail are possible across the Southeast States.

...Synopsis...
Upper troughiness will extend from the Northeast southwestward into
TX, with upper lows in both locales. The low/trough over the Mid
Atlantic and New England will deepen through the period, with the
base of this wave sweeping across VA and NC. To the south, cool
midlevel temperatures will remain over the Gulf Coast states as a
positive tilt trough develops over the western Gulf.

At the surface, weak low pressure will develop from the Mid Atlantic
Coast to the eastern Carolinas, ahead of a cold front. Sufficient
moisture will exist ahead of the front, from far southeast VA toward
the Gulf Coast and FL, to support scattered strong and isolated
severe daytime storms.

...Southeastern States...
Although the Gulf Coast portion of the front will be weak, moderate
instability due to strong heating should lead to scattered storms by
late afternoon in an east-west zone from southern MS into southern
GA. Forecast soundings depict weak shear but a steep lapse rate
environment favorable for diurnal hail. Cold downdrafts may also
yield localized wind damage.

To the north, storms will increase in coverage over much of the
Carolinas into far southeast VA. Instability may be a bit marginal
over north parts of this region due to early development. However,
pockets of air mass recovery will support scattered strong storms,
aided by the upper trough influence to the north.

Over FL, strong heating beneath cool midlevel temperatures (500 mb
around -11 C) will result in moderate instability. Isolated storms
are likely to develop over the interior Peninsula, with large hail
potential. Storms should move slowly given weak flow below 500 mb,
and as such, the threat should remain relatively localized.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1148 AM CDT Thu May 08 2025

Valid 081700Z - 091200Z

The Elevated area was expanded based on the latest observations and
high-resolution ensemble forecast guidance. RH has already dropped
to 15-30% in northwest Minnesota with wind gusts of 15-30 mph. In
western North Dakota, RH is generally 25-35% with sustained
south-southwest winds of 15-25 mph gusting 25-35 mph. With daytime
heating and the approaching cold front, elevated to locally critical
conditions are expected to develop across western North Dakota into
northwest Minnesota this afternoon into the early evening. 

An IsoDryT area was added as well in western North Dakota. There is
a 10-30% chance of isolated to scattered high-based showers and
thunderstorms across western North Dakota late this afternoon into
the evening along/ahead of an approaching cold front, with the area
along the pre-frontal trough likely a genesis zone. Precipitable
water values of 0.5-0.8", storm motions of 10-25 mph, and cloud
bases of ~3km AGL will help limit wetting rainfall, although some
training could be possible before winds aloft turn more westerly.
Gusty and erratic winds are also possible with these storms.

..Nauslar.. 05/08/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1250 AM CDT Thu May 08 2025/

...Synopsis...
Elevated fire weather conditions are expected this afternoon across
portions of western North Dakota. 05 UTC surface analysis shows a
surface low developing in the lee of the Canadian Rockies, which
will track to the east through the day. Southerly winds are forecast
to increase to 15-20 mph across ND ahead of a southeastward moving
cold front out of MT and Saskatchewan. Although isolated to
scattered showers and thunderstorms are expected along this boundary
by early evening, there should be a 3-4 hour wind during the
afternoon with warm temperatures in the low/mid 80s, RH values in
the low 20s, and breezy conditions. Although spring green up is
underway, dead grasses remain across the fuel landscape and are
sufficiently dry to carry large fires (as evidenced by a couple of
large fires in recent days across western ND). Similar wind/RH
conditions could develop along the MT/Canadian border within the
post-frontal regime, but wetting rainfall over the past three days
has likely mitigated fuel status for the time being. Elsewhere
across the country, widespread rain chances and weak gradient winds
will limit additional fire weather concerns.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS MUCH OF THE
MID-SOUTH INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND SOUTHEAST...AND PARTS OF THE
RIO GRANDE VALLEY IN TEXAS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered thunderstorms with severe wind gusts and large hail are
expected today over parts of the Tennessee Valley and southern
Appalachians/Southeast, with isolated very large hail possible.
Severe wind gusts and large to very large hail will also be possible
across portions of west/south Texas including the Rio Grande Valley.

...Tennessee Valley/Southeast Appalachians into the Southeast...
A positively tilted upper trough will extend from Ontario and the
Northeast southwestward across the Great Lakes, OH/TN Valley, and
into the Mid-South and southern Plains today. A weak surface low
analyzed this morning over the mid MS Valley is forecast to
gradually fill/lose definition through the afternoon/evening, as a
weak cold front moves slowly south-southeastward through the period.
Areas of at least scattered to broken clouds remain evident on
recent visible satellite imagery from northern MS/western TN to the
southern Appalachians. This will tend to hinder diurnal
destabilization to some extent, but cool temperatures aloft (around
-13 to -16C at 500 mb from area 12Z soundings) and modestly
steepened mid-level lapse rates should compensate to some extent.

Within the broader upper troughing, a weak embedded upper low/trough
will continue to advance slowly eastward from the mid MS Valley to
the TN Valley and southern Appalachians through this evening. Modest
large-scale ascent associated with this feature, along with weak
low-level convergence along the cold front, should be sufficient to
aid in at least scattered convective development across these
regions this afternoon. A combination of moderate instability and
around 30-40 kt of effective bulk shear appear adequate to support
some thunderstorm organization. Multiple supercells and short line
segments/clusters should develop and spread east-southeast this
afternoon/evening across parts of the Mid-South into the TN Valley
and southern Appalachians. Large hail will be possible with
sustained supercells, and isolated very large hail (potentially up
to 2-2.5 inches in diameter) could also occur. Otherwise,
severe/damaging winds will also be a concern with any clusters.
Based on latest observational and guidance trends showing a
favorable environment this afternoon and evening across a broader
portion of the TN Valley/Southeast, the Slight Risk has been
expanded westward some across the Mid-South/lower OH Valley where
convection is initiating, and eastward to include more of
north/central GA, and the western/central Carolinas into
south-central VA.

A somewhat separate area of strong to severe thunderstorms may focus
along/near the Atlantic Coast sea breeze this afternoon from parts
of coastal/southeast GA to the east-central FL Peninsula. Seasonably
cool temperatures aloft combined with moderate to strong instability
and a generally long/straight hodograph at mid/upper-levels should
support some threat for both large hail and damaging winds with any
cells/clusters that can form.

...Rio Grande Valley...
Thunderstorms are ongoing late this morning across parts of west TX,
in association with a weak shortwave trough over northern Mexico and
related modest low-level warm/moist advection. Current expectations
are for this activity to gradually increase in coverage and
intensity across the Big Bend region and vicinity through the
afternoon as daytime heating acts to further destabilize an already
moist low-level airmass. While mid-level winds are not forecast to
be overly strong with the low-amplitude shortwave trough, veering
winds with height will support deep-layer shear around 35-45 kt.
Supercells should be the primary convective mode initially, with a
threat for scattered large to very large hail (generally 1.5-2.5
inches in diameter) and isolated severe winds.

Additional intense convection should develop over the higher terrain
of north-central to northeast Mexico, with some potential for this
activity to spread east-southeastward across the Rio Grande Valley
this afternoon and evening in a moderately to strongly unstable
airmass. Large hail will continue to be a threat with any sustained
supercells, and the threat for severe/damaging winds may also
increase if a small cluster/MCS can develop and spread southeastward
this evening and tonight. Finally, a separate area of strong to
severe thunderstorms may develop through the afternoon along/near
the coast and a stalled front in deep south TX. This activity would
also pose some threat for severe hail/wind given a very
moist/unstable airmass and sufficient deep-layer shear for organized
updrafts.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
TENNESSEE VALLEY...SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS...SOUTHEAST AND THE RIO
GRANDE VALLEY OF TEXAS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered thunderstorms with severe wind gusts and large hail are
expected today over parts of the Tennessee Valley, and southern
Appalachians, with hailstones greater than 2 inches in diameter
possible. Severe wind gusts and large hail will also be possible in
other parts of the Southeast, as well as West/South Texas including
the Rio Grande Valley.

...Tennessee Valley/Southern Appalachians to Southeast...
A positively-tilted mid-level trough, with an upper low centered
over the Ozarks this morning, will move through the Ohio and mid
Mississippi Valleys today, and toward the Appalachians tonight.
Surface dewpoints to the south of an advancing cold front will range
from the mid 50s to the mid 60s F. As surface temperatures warm
during the day, moderate instability is expected to develop with
minimal convective inhibition beneath relatively cool mid-level
temperatures via the proximity of the upper cold pocket. 

Storms will steadily increase into the afternoon with some
supercells and organizing clusters from western and central Kentucky
into middle Tennessee, eastward into the southern Appalachians.
These storms will develop south-southeastward into northern Alabama,
northern Georgia and the western Carolinas by late afternoon. Large
hail can be expected, with hail greater than 2 inches in diameter
possible especially with the more discrete and intense supercells.
Damaging wind gusts can also be expected regionally.

Another relatively favorable area for severe storms may focus across
southeast Georgia and nearby far southern South Carolina and/or far
north Florida this afternoon through early evening. This will be
coincident with somewhat stronger mid-level flow as compared to
areas farther south across the northern/central Florida Peninsula,
where isolated severe storms are still expected. Regarding northern
Florida this morning, see Mesoscale Discussion 738.

...West/South Texas including Rio Grande Valley...
A low-latitude shortwave trough will progress east-southeastward
across far northern Mexico and along the Rio Grande Valley today and
tonight. A corridor of moderate to strong instability will be in
place across the Rio Grande Valley. As surface temperatures warm
today, scattered thunderstorms are expected to develop in the higher
terrain of northern Mexico, with convection spreading eastward into
and across the Rio Grande Valley, potentially with multiple
rounds/corridors of severe weather possible across South Texas.
Regarding short-term severe potential across South Texas, see
Mesoscale Discussion 739. Strong deep-layer shear will contribute to
supercells capable of large to very large hail and damaging wind
gusts, especially if storms cluster/organize across the Rio Grande
Valley later this afternoon into evening.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0330 PM CDT Wed May 07 2025

Valid 091200Z - 151200Z

Fire weather concerns will remain low in the D3/Wednesday through
D6/Monday period. A broad upper-low will linger across the
southeastern US as heights rise with an upper-level ridge building
in the western US. The building upper-level high in the west will
bring warming and drying conditions, but generally light winds will
keep fire concerns low. 

Late in period D6/Monday into D7/Tuesday, a trough is progged to
develop across the western Pacific. Increased southwesterly flow
aloft will overspread the Great Basin region, bringing likely
overlap of wind/dry conditions ahead of potential for more
precipitation. Less precipitation is expected across portions of
Arizona. Fuels in both of these regions are generally below seasonal
averages for dryness, owing to recent scattered shower and
thunderstorm activity. Though some drying is forecast in ERC
modeling, it is unlikely fuels will be overly receptive for fire
spread, leading to low confidence in including any areas at this
time. Some overlap of windy/dry conditions may extend into portions
of western New Mexico as well. For now, model spread leads to low
confidence in including areas.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
CENTRAL/EASTERN OKLAHOMA INTO WESTERN ARKANSAS AND THE OZARKS...AND
SOUTHEAST GEORGIA INTO PARTS OF FLORIDA...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms may occur today across parts of the
southern Plains into the Ozarks, and separately over southeast
Georgia into portions of Florida.

...20Z Update...
The primary change with this update was the removal of
severe-thunderstorm probabilities over the central Gulf Coast --
where a remnant MCS has moved offshore.

..Weinman.. 05/07/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1128 AM CDT Wed May 07 2025/

...Texas to the Central Gulf Coast...
Extensive convection and related outflow has shunted greater
low-level moisture and an effective front off most of the TX Coast
this morning. Ongoing clusters/supercells just south of the LA Coast
are generally expected to remain offshore this afternoon as they
track eastward along/near the surface boundary. A small and somewhat
separate cluster with a history of producing measured severe winds
near New Orleans should track along/near the MS/AL Coast over the
next few hours while weakening, as it will remain north of the
outflow boundary/front. Even so, modest heating of a residually
moist low-level airmass may support weak MUCAPE and an isolated
threat for damaging winds and perhaps a tornado with this activity.

The potential for renewed convective development this afternoon
across TX appears low, as the upper low over OK moves northeastward
towards the Ozarks. Neutral to weakly rising mid-level heights
suggest nebulous large-scale forcing at best, and perhaps some
subsidence through the day. While a strong thunderstorm or two may
still develop across south-central TX and vicinity near the stalled
front, the overall severe potential appears too low/conditional to
maintain even Marginal Risk caliber severe probabilities with this
update.

...Central/Eastern Oklahoma into Western Arkansas...
A mid/upper-level low over KS/OK will progress eastward to the
Ozarks/Lower MO Valley by tonight, accompanied by a belt of enhanced
west-southwesterly mid-level winds on its southern periphery. A weak
surface low and modest low-level convergence will exist this
afternoon across central/eastern OK. But, weak instability is still
expected to develop as cloud breaks occur under the mid-level cool
pocket (around -13 to -18 C at 500mb), with around 500-800 J/kg
MLCAPE plausible with peak afternoon heating. Some of the
lower-topped convection that develops could become strong to locally
severe with hail possible from mid/late afternoon into this evening.
Brief funnel/tornado potential may also diurnally exist given
ambient low-level vorticity/steep lapse rates in proximity to the
upper low. This activity is expected to quickly weaken with eastward
extent this evening with the loss of daytime heating.

...Florida/Coastal Georgia...
Isolated strong to severe thunderstorms may develop this afternoon
and early evening along and south of a front draped across
coastal/southeast GA into parts of FL. Moderate instability and
sufficient deep-layer shear should be present across these regions
to support some updraft organization. Occasional severe hail and
damaging winds may occur with the strongest cores.

..Thornton.. 05/07/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1238 AM CDT Wed May 07 2025/

...Synopsis...
Fire weather potential will generally be limited for much of the
country on Thursday, though regional concerns will likely emerge for
parts of western North Dakota during the afternoon hours. A cold
front associated with a clipper low migrating across the Canadian
Prairies is forecast to push across central and eastern MT during
the day. Pre-frontal southerly flow is forecast to increase to 15-20
mph across western ND by late afternoon. A combination of
temperatures warming into the low 80s with deep boundary-layer
mixing should yield RH values in the low to mid 20s. Much of western
ND has remained dry over the past few days, and residual dead
grasses have supported a couple of large fires over the past week.
While the fire weather threat is not expected to be particularly
widespread, the potential for elevated fire weather conditions over
a receptive fuel landscape warrants highlights.

0222 PM CDT Wed May 07 2025

Valid 091200Z - 101200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS IN THE
SOUTHEAST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms, from damaging winds along with some
hail, are possible across the Southeast States, mainly on Friday
afternoon to early evening.

...Synopsis...
An elongated mid/upper-level trough will begin to separate into a
more compact trough across the Northeast and a weak cutoff low over
the South-Central States. A weak surface cyclone should accompany
the northern shortwave impulse, tracking from the VA vicinity
towards coastal southern New England. 

...Southeast...
The aforementioned synoptic pattern evolution will confine the
spatial extent of at least moderate mid-level west-southwesterlies
closer to the Coastal Plain and Piedmont regions of the Southeast by
Friday afternoon. This should overlap a broad swath of 60s surface
dew points, with strong boundary-layer heating from the Carolinas
southward where moderate buoyancy is anticipated. Large-scale ascent
tied to the vigorous shortwave impulse over the Northeast should
largely remain displaced farther north of this plume. Highest
confidence in scattered storm development is along the sea breezes
and lee trough along the southern Appalachians. Isolated damaging
winds and severe hail will be possible.

0313 AM CDT Wed May 07 2025

Valid 101200Z - 151200Z

...DISCUSSION...
From this weekend through early next week, an upper-level low will
be situated in the lower Mississippi Valley into the northern Gulf.
This feature will drive repeated days of convection within parts of
the Southeast into the Florida Peninsula. Lower-end severe potential
may occur with this activity, but how organized/intense it will be
is not certain. The upper-level low will become more progressive and
lift northeastward by the middle of next week. Shortwave ridging
aloft will move through the Plains into the Southeast in advance of
a western trough. With the presence of the upper low over the Gulf
Coast region, there will be offshore flow in the western Gulf for a
few days before moisture returns northward again in response to the
mid-week trough.

The largest uncertainty with this system will be the moisture
quality. Secondly, models currently project the strongest forcing to
be within the central/northern Plains, farther away from the
moisture plume moving north. At least as currently forecast, strong
southwesterly/westerly winds aloft should overspread the
southern/central Plains by late next week. This particular trend in
guidance is recent and confidence is accordingly low, but model
trends will continue to be monitored in the coming days.

Mesoscale Discussion 0723
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0348 PM CDT Tue May 06 2025

Areas affected...Southeast Texas to much of Louisiana.

Concerning...Tornado Watch 234...

Valid 062048Z - 062215Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 234 continues.

SUMMARY...Continued threat for severe wind gusts, tornadoes, and
isolated hail.

DISCUSSION...A well-developed line of storms extends from
east-central Texas to northwest Louisiana. Sporadic wind damage and
at least one tornado has been reported thus far within the line. A
more favorable orientation of the line has occurred across northeast
Texas/northwest Louisiana where a bowing segment is apparent. In
addition, a tornado with a TDS was recently observed southwest of
the SHV radar where a leading supercell interacted with this line.
Limited surface base instability amid mid 60s dewpoints and
preceding rainfall should keep the tornado threat somewhat limited,
but enough surface based or near surface based instability is
present for some tornado threat near the apex of this bow,
particularly where any cell interactions occur. Expect the greatest
severe wind threat near this bowing segment of the line across
northern Louisiana this afternoon and into the early evening.
Farther south, isolated large hail and severe wind gusts are
possible, particularly with any embedded supercells within the line.

A conditional greater tornado threat exists with any supercells
which can develop along/south of the warm front in Louisiana where
STP values are around 2 to 3. STP values may increase this evening
as low-level shear strengthens. Convection strengthening across
southeast Texas could be the beginning of this potential threat. If
any of these supercells can remain discrete with sufficient
longevity to mature, they will pose a strong tornado threat this
afternoon/evening.

New Jersey and southern New York

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 233...

Valid 062037Z - 062200Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 233
continues.

SUMMARY...Additional instances of damaging gusts and perhaps hail
remain possible with the stronger storms. A tornado may still occur
with storms ahead of a pre-frontal boundary.

DISCUSSION...A primary arching band of strong thunderstorms persists
ahead of a pseudo-dryline pre-frontal boundary across far eastern
PA, with temperatures rising into the upper 70s F amid 10 degree F
dewpoint decreases as the boundary passes. These pre-frontal storms
have been the most organized so far, with multiple instances of
low-level rotation detected and an apparent tornado reported in the
past hour. The best chance for an additional tornado remains with
these storms, along the PA/NJ/NY borders, before the ongoing storms
move into a more stable airmass. Otherwise, strong wind gusts and
perhaps hail may develop with the stronger storms to the west of the
pre-frontal boundary.

Areas affected...much of the Florida Peninsula

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 061927Z - 062200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...A sparse severe threat could develop this afternoon across
the FL Peninsula, where a stray damaging gust or instance of hail
are possible. However, the severe threat should be isolated at best,
precluding a WW issuance.

DISCUSSION...Strong surface heating has aided in thunderstorm
initiation across the FL Peninsula as temperatures have climbed over
90 F. Given at least upper 60s F dewpoints steep low-level lapse
rates, 2000-3000 J/kg MLCAPE are in place south of a remnant frontal
boundary per 19Z mesoanalysis. Synoptic forcing is weak and vertical
wind shear is quite poor, casting doubt on any appreciable severe
threat. However, if a robust thunderstorm manages to develop and
persist, the strong buoyancy in place may support an instance of
hail or strong wind gusts, especially over southern parts of the
Florida Peninsula. Given the very isolated nature of the severe
threat, a WW issuance is not expected.

Mesoscale Discussion 0712
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0611 AM CDT Tue May 06 2025

Areas affected...South-central into east-central TX

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 230...

Valid 061111Z - 061415Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 230
continues.

SUMMARY...An increase in the tornado threat is expected with time
this morning. Tornado Watch issuance is likely later this morning,
though timing is uncertain.

DISCUSSION...Some increase in convection has recently been noted
across parts of the TX Hill Country, in close proximity to a surface
warm front that is expected to lift northward through the morning
across parts of south-central into east-central TX. Favorable
deep-layer shear and low-level SRH (as noted on the KEWX VWP) will
result in supercell potential through the morning, especially as the
warm front moves northward and rich low-level moisture continues to
support moderate to locally strong buoyancy. 

Timing of additional supercell development and maturation within the
warm-advection regime remains somewhat uncertain, as does the
potential influence of an ongoing eastward-moving storm cluster near
San Angelo. However, as the threat for surface-based supercells
increases, a corresponding increase in the tornado threat is
expected with time this morning, in addition to potential for large
hail and locally damaging winds. A Tornado Watch will likely be
needed later this morning, though timing is uncertain.

    to 2.5 inches in diameter possible
  Isolated damaging wind gusts to 65 mph possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...At least isolated severe storms are expected to expand
east-northeastward across parts of the Low Rolling Plains toward
North-central/central Texas. Large hail will be the primary hazard
overnight, with locally damaging winds also possible. Tornado
potential should increase into central Texas/I-35 vicinity later
this morning.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 70
statute miles north and south of a line from 60 miles north
northwest of San Angelo TX to 55 miles north of Austin TX. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU0).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

Mesoscale Discussion 0700
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0348 PM CDT Mon May 05 2025

Areas affected...portions of southeastern Texas

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 225...

Valid 052048Z - 052215Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 225
continues.

SUMMARY...The severe threat continues across Severe Thunderstorm
Watch 225. Large hail remains the main concern, but a tornado could
still occur if a supercell can become surface based.

DISCUSSION...Multiple supercell structures have developed across
southeast Texas, and have been progressing eastward on the immediate
cool side of a baroclinic zone. These supercells are likely still
elevated, and given adequate buoyancy above 700 mb (per RAP forecast
soundings), severe hail could still occur given elongated mid to
upper-level hodographs and corresponding 50+ kts of effective bulk
shear. Closer to the Gulf Coast, multiple thunderstorms continue to
intensify within a WAA regime. These storms are associated with a
relatively more unstable, surface-based airmass. Regional VADs on
the warm side of the baroclinic boundary show low-level hodographs
with modest size and curvature, with around 300 m2/s2 SRH present
(per 19Z mesoanalysis). It is unclear if these storms can organize
and intensify into mature surface-based supercells before reaching
the cool side of the baroclinic boundary. If they do though, a
tornado remains possible.

Mesoscale Discussion 0699

0311 PM CDT Mon May 05 2025

Areas affected...east-central and southeast FL

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 224...

Valid 052011Z - 052215Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 224
continues.

SUMMARY...Potential for isolated large hail and localized severe
gusts should persist through early to mid evening across southeast
and east-central Florida.

DISCUSSION...Several cells across southeast FL have somewhat
weakened after earlier producing large hail reported up to ping-pong
ball size. This activity may still produce marginal hail/wind as
storms oscillate in the near-term. Large-scale convective outflow
has surged south and west, potentially serving as a focus for storm
development in the interior peninsula into early evening. 

Farther north, the Melbourne VWP has consistently sampled around
40-45 kt 0-6 km shear. Although thunderstorm development has been
subdued to an extent, additional storms may yet form along the
Atlantic sea breeze to the quasi-stationary front. Ample buoyancy
will favor isolated large hail and localized severe gusts.

Mesoscale Discussion 0697
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0210 PM CDT Mon May 05 2025

Areas affected...eastern NC and southeast VA

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 223...

Valid 051910Z - 052115Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 223
continues.

SUMMARY...A mixed severe hail/damaging wind threat should persist
across eastern North Carolina and advance/shift north-northeast
across southeast Virginia through early evening.

DISCUSSION...Numerous cells have been prevalent, especially across
central into eastern NC this afternoon. Here, a south-southwesterly
deep-layer wind profile, per area VWPs, along with transient
supercell structures has resulted in convection largely progressing
northeastward thus far. But activity should pivot to a greater
northerly component given the evolution of the upstream vort
max/attendant mid-level jetlet. Air mass appears to be modestly
unstable downstream across southeast VA with MLCAPE of 1000-1500
J/kg. This should help sustain a severe hail/damaging wind threat
through early evening. Despite numerous cells and hail reports, peak
severe magnitude has only reached 1 inch thus far.

Mesoscale Discussion 0684
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0338 PM CDT Sun May 04 2025

Areas affected...southeast NM and far west TX

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 222...

Valid 042038Z - 042215Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 222
continues.

SUMMARY...Supercells are expected to intensify across southeast New
Mexico into parts of far west Texas through early evening. Hail is
the primary hazard, likely reaching golf to tennis ball size.
Isolated severe gusts to 70 mph and a brief tornado are possible.

DISCUSSION...Overall forecast remains as advertised. Storm
intensification has been gradual, but largely focused near the
Sacramento Mountains in Otero and Lincoln counties, and separately
over Eddy and Chaves, spreading into Lea within NM. These cells and
others that should develop off the higher terrain of the northern
Trans-Pecos in TX will likely intensify during the next few hours. A
ribbon of surface dew points near 50 F have held along the Pecos
Valley, supporting a confined corridor of moderate buoyancy. With
onset of strengthening low-level flow around 22Z, supercell
coverage/intensity should peak into early evening. Thereafter, drier
low-level air over the TX South Plains and eastern Permian Basin
should result in increased ingest of MLCIN deeper into the evening.

Mesoscale Discussion 0677
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0547 AM CDT Sun May 04 2025

Areas affected...eastern North Carolina into far southeast Virginia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 041047Z - 041345Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated strong gusts, and perhaps a brief/weak tornado,
cannot be ruled out over eastern North Carolina and eventually into
far southeast Virginia.

DISCUSSION...A line of convection with wind shift continues to push
east, now completely out of SC and over eastern NC. Earlier, a 50 kt
gust was measured near North Myrtle Beach. 

In addition to the narrow north-south line of convection, other
storms have developed ahead of the line. These storms have shown
periodic weak mesocyclones. Other storms continue to show
near-severe inbound velocities mainly over the water, but this
activity may eventually move inland.

The air mass is marginally unstable, but sufficient for isolated
severe reports this morning. Low-level SRH with 0-1 km values of
100-150 m2/s2 will continue to favor rotation within the stronger
storms, though any tornado risk should remain low-end in nature.
