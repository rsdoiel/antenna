Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0743 AM CDT Tue Sep 10 2024

Valid 101300Z - 111200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER COASTAL
AREAS OF LOUISIANA...

...SUMMARY...
Marginal tornado potential may reach coastal areas of Louisiana
during the late overnight/early morning hours.

...Synopsis...
In mid/upper levels, a strong shortwave trough now over the eastern
Gulf of Alaska is forecast to dig southeastward and develop a closed
500-mb cyclone tonight, with the low about 150 nm west of AST by 12Z
tomorrow.  Ahead of this progressive and intensifying perturbation, 
height falls and strengthening cyclonic flow will spread across the
northwestern CONUS throughout the period, combining with modest low/
middle-level moisture to support thunderstorm potential in parts of
the Northwest, in addition to the diurnal-cycle convection across
the Four Corners region, central/northern Rockies and parts of MT.

Downstream, mid/upper flow should be nearly zonal from the Rockies
across the Great Lakes.  An embedded shortwave trough was evident in
moisture-channel imagery over the Dakotas.  This feature is forecast
to move eastward to MN by 00Z, then across the Upper Great Lakes to
Lake Huron and adjoining parts of ON by 12Z.  Farther south, a weak,
cut-off, mid/upper-level low over north-central TX should drift
erratically near its present location, while increasingly
influencing the path of Tropical Storm Francine. 

The 11Z surface analysis showed a wavy, quasistationary frontal zone
fro Atlantic waters offshore SC, across northern FL to near the
Mississippi River mouth, then a warm front arching across Gulf
waters just south of the LA and TX Coasts, and into western parts of
the Francine circulation.  This boundary should move little from
about 90W eastward, but remain a warm front over the upper TX and LA
coastal waters, diffusely shifting inland over southern LA through
the period. 

...LA Coast...
T.S. Francine -- initially centered southeast of BRO -- is forecast
by NHC to turn northeastward across the northwestern Gulf today and
become a hurricane, then move ashore in Louisiana on day 2. 
Suitably rich low-level moisture already is in place over coastal
LA, and scattered to numerous showers and thunderstorms should cover
the outlook area throughout much of the period, even well northeast
of Francine's center.  However, supercell potential will await
sufficiently strong wind fields reaching the coastline ahead of the
cyclone to enlarge hodographs favorably -- likely during the last
few hours of the period.  Then, tornado potential will be a matter
of having relatively distinct/discrete, outer-band convection that
can survive long enough to mature into supercells before weakening
again in more-stable inflow air -- either inland or in broader
precip areas.  Unconditional probabilities are kept at marginal
levels for now, given the late timing of the favorable kinematic
fields, the nocturnal min in overland instability, and convective/
structural uncertainties with Francine.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0202 AM CDT Tue Sep 10 2024

Valid 111200Z - 121200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE GREAT BASIN...

...Synopsis...
The upper trough over the western US will quickly intensify
Wednesday, as a shortwave perturbation and mid-level jet streak move
onshore over the West Coast. As the trough strengthens, mid-level
flow over much of the West will increase. A surface low will deepen
over the northern Great Basin, while a cold front moves onshore and
also strengthens. To the east, TS Francine will approach the Gulf
Coast with offshore winds likely over parts of the mid South. Strong
surface winds, low humidity, and thunderstorms over parts of the
West and central US will support critical fire-weather concerns
Wednesday.

...Great Basin...
Ahead of the deepening trough, a potent mid-level jet streak will
move over parts of the western Great Basin beginning early
Wednesday. A deepening surface low in parts of the eastern Basin
will drive 20-25 mph winds over much of NV into western UT.
Augmented by downslope flow off the Sierra and the approaching cold
front, a brief period of winds of 25-30 mph will be possible along
with RH below 15%. Widespread critical fire-weather conditions are
likely over parts of the Great Basin. Fire-weather concerns should
diminish behind the front as cooler and more quiescent conditions
are expected behind the front into early Thursday.

...Lee of the Rockies and High Plains...
As the trough approaches, height falls and stronger flow aloft will
overspread the Rockies and High Plains. A surface low will deepen
first in eastern MT, with a lee trough extending south into the
central High Plains. Near the lee trough, strong southerly winds
will overlap with areas of low RH and drying fine fuels. Elevated
fire weather concerns are expected over parts of the High Plains
Wednesday afternoon and evening.

...Mid South...
As Francine approaches the Gulf Coast Wednesday and Wednesday night,
offshore pressure gradients will increase over parts of the lower MS
Valley and Mid South. While humidity values are not expected to be
overly low with the tropical air mass approaching, strong gusts are
expected to overlap with areas of relatively dry fuels and little
recent rainfall. Brief elevated fire-weather conditions are possible
before rain chances increase into early Thursday.

...Northwest Thunder...
Ahead of the cold front, increasing mid-level moisture and strong
lift from the trough will promote scattered thunderstorms Wednesday
afternoon. Lightning may interact with areas of somewhat drier fuels
over parts of the Northwest and northern Rockies before broader
wetting rainfall develops. However, these storms will likely have
higher precipitation efficiency with a cooler air mass and more
plentiful Pacific moisture in place. This lends significant
uncertainty on the threat for any lightning ignitions.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR PARTS OF THE
LA GULF COAST...

...SUMMARY...
Some tornado threat associated with Tropical Cyclone Francine may
approach the Louisiana Gulf Coast by early Wednesday morning.

...Synopsis...
Tropical Storm Francine will potentially intensify into a hurricane
as it moves north-northeastward across the western Gulf of Mexico.
Meanwhile, a strong mid/upper-level shortwave trough is forecast to
dig southeastward into the Pacific Northwest and northern CA.
Diurnal thunderstorms capable of locally gusty winds will be
possible from the eastern Great Basin into parts of the Rockies, and
also across the FL Peninsula. More isolated storms will also be
possible from the central Plains into the parts of the upper
Midwest, which may also be capable of locally gusty winds. Organized
severe-thunderstorm potential is expected to remain low, with the
possible exception of the LA Gulf Coast region late in the period in
association with Francine. 

...LA Gulf Coast vicinity...
Refer to NHC forecasts and advisories for more information regarding
Tropical Storm Francine. Based on the current forecast track, the
most favorable environment for low-topped supercells associated with
Francine should remain offshore for most of the forecast period.
However, some outer bands may begin to approach the LA Gulf Coast
prior to 12Z Wednesday morning, accompanied by an increase in
low-level shear/SRH. A small Marginal Risk has been included near
the immediate LA Gulf Coast for the potential of an increasing
tornado threat prior to the end of the forecast period.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0150 AM CDT Mon Sep 09 2024/

...Synopsis...
Broad trouhging over the Northwest should continue today as an
embedded perturbation moves eastward over the northern Rockies.
Southwesterly flow aloft is forecast to increase over much of the
West as the broad trough slowly shifts east. At the surface, a cold
front will move into the Rockies, bringing a cooler air mass to
parts of the Northwest, but gusty winds to parts of the Cascades. A
lee trough developing east of the Rockies will help support isolated
dry thunderstorms over parts of WY and MT. Periods of stronger
surface winds and low RH will support elevated to near-critical
fire-weather conditions.
 
...Northwest and Great Basin....
Stronger flow aloft is expected to persist today over much of the
Northwest and northern Great Basin. Surface winds should increase to
15-25 mph as momentum from aloft mixes down. Downsloping and
mid-level drying should keep the air mass quite dry with diurnal RH
minimums below 15% likely. Several hours of widespread elevated to
near-critical fire-weather conditions are likely across the northern
Sierra and Great Basin.

Farther north, more moderate RH of 25-30% is expected beneath the
upper trough and behind the cold front. Despite the arrival of a
cooler Pacific air mass, downslope winds of 15-25 mph should overlap
with dry fuels and pockets of lower RH during the day. Overlapping
with recent lightning and fire activity, a few hours of elevated to
near-critical conditions are possible in the lee of the Cascades as
winds increase.

...Northern Rockies...
Stronger westerly flow head of the embedded shortwave will aid in
deepening a lee trough east of the Rockies. Westerly surface winds
should strengthen in turn, supporting pockets of downslope winds of
15-25 mph across parts of MT and WY. With hot temperatures and
little recent rainfall, afternoon RH values should remain quite low,
generally below 20%. Increasing winds, receptive fuels, and
persistent dry conditions should support several hours of elevated
to near critical fire-weather conditions over parts of the northern
Rockies.

...Dry Thunder...
Isolated, high-based thunderstorms appear likely over parts of the
Rockies (mainly WY and MT) today ahead of the shortwave trough. Weak
buoyancy, and PWATs of 0.5 to 0.7 inches, atop dry and well-mixed
low levels will support poor precipitation efficiency and the
potential for strong outflow winds. At least isolated storms are
expected over areas of receptive fuels. Thus, dry lightning
ignitions are possible, especially across parts of north-central WY,
where storm coverage appears greatest.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
NEW YORK...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated damaging winds may occur this afternoon across parts of New
York.

...New York...
Within large-scale upper troughing over the Northeast and eastern
Canada, an embedded shortwave trough over southern Ontario and the
upper Great Lakes will continue to move across the Northeast this
afternoon and evening. Ascent associated with this shortwave trough
and related mid-level jet is supporting isolated thunderstorms
across southern Ontario and vicinity. This activity will spread
east-southeastward this afternoon across parts of NY. The airmass
over this region should become only weakly unstable as filtered
daytime heating occurs, with poor mid-level lapse rates, persistent
cloud cover, and modest low-level moisture limiting destabilization.
Still, gradually increasing west-northwesterly winds at low/mid
levels will foster around 25-35 kt of deep-layer shear. This should
support modest thunderstorm organization, with multicells/small
clusters potentially evolving along and downstream of Lake Ontario.
Isolated strong to damaging winds should be the main threat with
this convection as it moves across much of NY this afternoon and
early evening, before eventually weakening with eastward extent with
the loss of daytime heating.

...Northern/Central Rockies and High Plains...
Isolated to widely scattered thunderstorms should develop this
afternoon over portions of the northern/central Rockies as a weak
shortwave trough continues eastward. Low-level moisture and related
instability are both expected to remain rather meager into the High
Plains, which should limit updraft intensities. Still, isolated
strong/gusty winds may occur with this high-based activity across
parts of MT/WY where low-level lapse rates can become steepened.
Greater low-level moisture is present farther east into the Dakotas,
along/east of a weak surface low/trough. But, increasing
low/mid-level temperatures and a strong cap should generally inhibit
thunderstorm development through much of the day with eastward
extent across the northern/central Plains.
