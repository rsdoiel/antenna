Mesoscale Discussion 0469
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0940 AM CDT Wed Apr 17 2024

Areas affected...far northeast IL into northern IN and southwest
Lower MI

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 171440Z - 171545Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms will gradually develop this morning, mainly
across northwest IN into far southwest MI. Severe potential should
remain low the next 1-2 hours.

DISCUSSION...Visible satellite data and regional radar indicates
convection is beginning to deepen ahead of the eastward advancing
cold front. This activity will likely only slowly continue to
intensify through the morning. Nevertheless, temperatures are
already in the upper 60s to low 70s with weak instability noted in
14z mesoanalysis. Severe potential is expected to remain low over
the next couple of hours, but gusty winds to 45 mph will be possible
with these showers and isolated thunderstorms. A watch is not
expected in the short term, but severe potential should increase by
around midday/early afternoon downstream.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0752 AM CDT Wed Apr 17 2024

Valid 171300Z - 181200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
SOUTHERN LOWER MICHIGAN INTO THE OHIO VALLEY...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered thunderstorms capable of producing damaging winds, large
hail, and a few tornadoes should develop across parts of the Ohio
Valley and Lower Great Lakes this afternoon. Thunderstorms with
mainly a large hail threat may occur tonight over parts of the
central Plains.

...Synopsis...
An upper trough/low over the Upper Midwest this morning will
continue to move east-northeastward across the Great Lakes and OH
Valley today while gradually de-amplifying/weakening. An associated
40-60 kt mid-level jet will accompany this trough and overspread
much of the OH/TN Valleys. At the surface, a low over southeastern
MN/western WI should continue to gradually occlude through the day
in tandem with the weakening upper cyclone. An attendant cold front
will sweep eastward over the Lower Great Lakes/OH Valley through
this evening, while a warm front advances as far north as parts of
Lower MI and perhaps far western NY.

...Lower Michigan into the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys and
Mid-Atlantic...
Upper 50s to low 60s surface dewpoints are expected to be in place
ahead of the cold front late this morning/early afternoon. A
pronounced mid-level dry slot evident on water vapor satellite
imagery should aid in diurnal destabilization via a general lack of
mid/upper-level cloud cover across parts of the OH Valley. As the
boundary layer gradually warms/moistens, around 1000-1500 J/kg of
MLCAPE should develop across southern Lower MI, eastern IN, and OH.
Sufficiently strong low/mid-level winds will support 40-50 kt of
deep-layer shear and updraft organization. Current expectations are
for convection to develop along or just ahead of the cold front by
early afternoon, and subsequently spread quickly east-northeastward
across Lower MI, OH, and western PA through this evening. Tendency
may be for thunderstorms to quickly organize into a line, especially
across Lower MI which will be in closer proximity to the large-scale
ascent attendant to the upper trough/low. If this evolution occurs,
then severe/damaging winds would be the main threat with this
activity. Have expanded the Marginal and Slight Risks northward
across Lower MI to account for this potential.

Farther south across eastern IN and OH, forcing will gradually
become more limited, which may allow for somewhat lower thunderstorm
coverage initially. Even so, deep-layer shear will be strong enough
to support supercells, with large hail, damaging wind, and a few
tornadoes all possible. The best tornado potential may be focused
across parts of southeastern Lower MI and northern OH, in closer
proximity to the warm front and greater low-level shear. Some
upscale growth may also occur with this activity as it moves into
eastern OH and western PA, with a potentially greater threat for
damaging winds through the early evening before convection
eventually weakens.

Overall convective coverage should be lower across the TN Valley
into the Southeast, with weaker large-scale ascent present over
these regions. Still, isolated strong thunderstorms may occur this
afternoon and early evening in a weakly unstable but strong
deep-layer shear environment. Occasional hail and gusty winds appear
possible with the more robust cores. Based on latest guidance
trends, have trimmed the western extent of the Marginal Risk over
western KY/TN and northern MS.

Across the eastern Mid-Atlantic (northern VA/MD/DC/DE/south-central
PA), a well-mixed boundary layer and steep low-level lapse rates
forecast by some guidance may support occasional strong to damaging
winds with convection spreading eastward off the higher terrain of
the Appalachians and Blue Ridge Mountains. With limited instability,
the overall severe wind threat will likely remain isolated.

...Nebraska/Kansas into Iowa/Missouri...
An upper-level trough will move eastward across the north-central
CONUS tonight. A 40-45 kt southerly low-level jet will develop this
evening across parts of the southern/central Plains in response.
Thunderstorms should eventually initiate near the northern edge of
the low-level jet late this evening from central KS into far
southeast NE. Ample MUCAPE, steep mid-level lapse rates, and strong
shear in the cloud-bearing layer should support some threat for
large hail with this mainly elevated convection. The large hail
threat should to be greatest in the 04Z to 08Z time window with
initial development, but it may persist through the end of the
period. If convection can grow upscale into a small bowing cluster,
then isolated damaging winds may also occur.

A conditional threat for a supercell or two will exist farther south
across south-central/southeastern KS into far northeastern OK. Here,
modest low-level convergence along the intersection of a developing
warm front and dryline may be sufficient to initiate isolated
convection early this evening as the low-level jet strengthens. If
this occurs, then all severe hazards appear possible.

...Texas...
Very isolated thunderstorms may develop late this afternoon and
early evening across parts of south-central into central TX along a
surface dryline. If any convection can be sustained, it could
produce severe winds and hail. But, this threat currently appears
too conditional and uncertain to add low severe probabilities.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0153 AM CDT Wed Apr 17 2024

Valid 181200Z - 191200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Predominately zonal mid-level flow is expected over the CONUS by
D2/Thursday. Stronger westerly flow is expected to gradually shift
east as weak high pressure builds over the West. At the surface, a
cold front is forecast to move across much of the plains ushering in
a cooler air mass. Surface high pressure behind the front should
keep winds modest over much of the central US. The only exception to
this may be across parts of far northeast NM and southern CO. Here,
the dry air mass may remain sheltered from the cold front supporting
at least brief localized fire-weather conditions D2/Thursday
afternoon. Otherwise, fire-weather potential appears limited across
the CONUS.

Mesoscale Discussion 0465
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0447 PM CDT Tue Apr 16 2024

Areas affected...portions of eastern/southeastern Iowa into
northwestern Illinois

Concerning...Tornado Watch 117...

Valid 162147Z - 162315Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 117 continues.

SUMMARY...The ongoing convective line has evolved into semi-discrete
supercells which will allow for an increase in the risk for all
hazards over the next couple of hours. A favorable
shear/thermodynamic environment may also support a strong (EF-2+)
tornado.

DISCUSSION...As of 2140 UTC, regional radar and satellite data
showed the ongoing convective line in southeastern IA has trended
towards more semi-discrete elements, especially with southward
extent, over the last hour. The broader environment remains
favorable for severe storms with moderate buoyancy and strong
deep-layer shear established. Low-level shear has also increased
ahead of the storms with backed surface flow supporting 300-400
m2/s2 of effective SRH observed from area VADs and SPC mesoanalysis.
With a more supercellular mode emerging, the potential for stronger
mesocyclones within a strong low-level shear environment suggests an
increasing potential for tornadoes, in addition to the continued
risk for damaging winds and hail. STP values of 2-3 along with 0-3km
CAPE of 50-100 J/kg favor strong low-level stretching of vertical
vorticity. Large low-level hodogaphs may also support the risk for a
strong (EF-2+) tornado with the longer lived supercells. This
increasing risk may extended near the Quad Cities and farther east
into parts of northwestern IL over the next couple of hours.

Mesoscale Discussion 0464
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0340 PM CDT Tue Apr 16 2024

Areas affected...portions of northern/central IL

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 162040Z - 162215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Severe potential may slowly increase over the next few
hours into parts of northern and central Illinois. A watch may be
needed at some point late this afternoon, but timing remains
uncertain.

DISCUSSION...A band of storms continues to lift northeast across
eastern IA into western IL this afternoon. Much of the convection is
somewhat disorganized in a messy storm mode. Downstream into
northern/central IL, some modest increase in boundary-layer moisture
still may occur as a warm front lifts north. While strong heating
has occurred, some weak inhibition remains over parts of the area.
Nevertheless, modest boundary-layer moisture beneath midlevel lapse
rates around 7 C/km are supporting weak instability (MLCAPE 1000
J/kg or less). The initial band of convection moving toward the MCD
area may largely remain unproductive. However, as large-scale ascent
increasing toward evening, a secondary band of convection may move
into the area and post more of a severe risk. Given the somewhat
limited thermodynamic environment (despite favorable vertical
shear), severe potential may only gradually increase toward evening.
The area will be monitored for potential watch issuance, but timing
is uncertain.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0337 PM CDT Tue Apr 16 2024

Valid 181200Z - 241200Z

An upper-level trough will continue into the Great Lakes and
Northeast into the weekend. Models are suggesting that a more
amplified western ridge/eastern trough pattern will develop by early
next week. A push of cooler air will move into the southern Plains
late this week with another push expected during the weekend.

Given recent and expected precipitation, fire weather concerns
within much of CONUS should remain low. Dry and modestly breezy
conditions are expected to remain across parts of the Southwest
through part of the weekend, west of a back-door cold font. However,
fuels across the region are generally marginally receptive with
perhaps the exception of increasingly dry areas of central/western
New Mexico. Even so, potential for critical fire weather appears too
low for highlights.

Day 1 Convective Outlook

0254 PM CDT Tue Apr 16 2024

Valid 162000Z - 171200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
MIDWEST AND MIDDLE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are likely today, especially across
northern Missouri, Iowa, and northwestern Illinois. Large hail,
damaging winds, and tornadoes are expected. More isolated activity
could develop as far south as the Ozarks and Mid-South.

...Synopsis...
The previous forecast largely remains on track with only minor
modifications made to reflect convective trends across portions of
NE, KS, and western MO. Recent analyses show that the best kinematic
environment resides from central AR into MO and southern/southeast
IA. However, thermodynamic limitations (largely due to warm
temperatures in the 850-700 mb as sampled by the 18 UTC DVN and 19
UTC ILX soundings and modest mid-level lapse rates) and unfavorable
storm interactions have modulated convective intensity/organization
thus far. Further intensification remains possible through the
afternoon/early evening amid peak diurnal heating (see MCD 460 for
additional near-term details). Across far eastern NE into western
IA, cold temperatures aloft (supporting surface-based lifted indices
between -7 to -9 C) combined with plentiful ambient low-level
vorticity along surface boundaries continues to support a tornado
threat. See MCD 461 for additional details.

..Moore.. 04/16/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1140 AM CDT Tue Apr 16 2024/

...Midwest/Middle Mississippi Valley...
Regenerative scattered showers and thunderstorms continue to occur
across western/northern Missouri into much of Iowa at late morning,
originating with a warm sector that narrows with north-northwestward
extent into southern Iowa and far east/northeast Nebraska in
vicinity of the surface low. Even while warm-sector cloud breaks
have been limited, steady early-spring heating and low-level
moistening is occurring with surface dewpoints rising through the
lower 60s F.

This development coincides with an intense/cyclonically curved 90+
kt polar jet and a low-level jet that will remain diurnally strong
(40+ kt). Modest cloud breaks aside, destabilization will be further
aided by a pocket of steep mid-level lapse rates and cold
temperatures aloft on the southeast side of the upper trough/low.
Scenario supports a risk for supercells especially across northern
Missouri into southern/eastern Iowa and northwest Illinois.

Steep mid-level lapse rates will aid in hail production, with a few
golf ball or 2+ inch diameter stones possible with the more robust
cores. Tornadoes will also be a concern, as the enhanced
boundary-layer flow and enlarged/curved hodographs associated with
the low-level jet will aid in updraft rotation. The main tornado
potential is still expected to be focused along/near the warm front
in southern/eastern Iowa where the stronger low-level shear is
forecast. A strong (EF2+) tornado is possible. Isolated to scattered
damaging winds are otherwise expected regionally.

Farther south toward the Ozarks and Mid-South, a potential for at
least isolated severe thunderstorms remains apparent into this
evening, with a moist/confluent regime near/ahead of the
eastward-advancing front. Mid-level lapse rates will remain limited.
However, steady low-level moistening will tend to counteract a
tendency for nocturnal boundary cooling, netting a scenario with
limited warm-sector inhibition tonight, supporting the possibility
of supercells capable of all severe hazards including a tornado
risk, even if severe storms remain relatively isolated overall.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1228 PM CDT Tue Apr 16 2024

Valid 171200Z - 181200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS NORTHEAST INDIANA
INTO SOUTHEAST LOWER MICHIGAN AND MUCH OF OHIO...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are possible Wednesday afternoon and
evening from southern Lower Michigan into parts of the Ohio Valley.
A more isolated severe threat may materialize across parts of
Tennessee Valley into the Southwest as well as parts of the
east-central Plains and Ozark Plateau.

...Synopsis...
The upper-level wave and attendant surface low currently over the
central Plains/Midwest are forecast to weaken over the next 24-48
hours as they gradually lift to the northeast. A trailing surface
cold front associated with the low is forecast to push east across
the Great Lakes region through the day it becomes increasingly
influenced by mean westerly flow. This boundary should be the focus
for strong to severe thunderstorm development by late morning/early
afternoon across IN/OH and lower MI. Additional thunderstorm
development is anticipated by peak heating across portions of the TN
Valley as a residual outflow boundary migrates east. To the west
across the Plains, a warm advection regime should become established
by early evening as a surface low begins to deepen ahead of an
approaching upper-level wave. Isolated strong to severe
thunderstorms are possible within the warm advection regime across
parts of the Ozarks into the east-central Plains. 

...Midwest/Great Lakes...
Broken cloud cover is anticipated Wednesday morning across the
Midwest/Great Lakes as a mid-level dry slot overspreads the region
in the wake of Tuesday night's convection. The north/northeast track
of the decaying surface low should allow for low to mid 60s
dewpoints to spread north into IN/OH and lower MI by late morning
ahead of the approaching cold front. Thunderstorm development may
occur by mid-morning across portions of IN, but the development and
intensification of any convection will be dependent on the degree of
subsidence within the dry slot. Diurnal heating of the low-level air
mass should allow for 1000-2000 J/kg SBCAPE by early afternoon with
decreasing inhibition. Consequently, more robust convection is
likely by early afternoon across lower MI into western OH.
Deep-layer flow off the front should favor initially discrete cells
within a broken line of storms with an attendant hail and tornado
risk. Steepening low-level lapse rates, combined with 40-50 knot
mid-level flow, should support an increasing damaging wind threat by
late afternoon. Upscale growth into one or more clusters is probable
by late afternoon into the evening hours across eastern OH and far
western PA given strong forcing along the front and similar storm
and boundary motions. Further south into the OH River Valley,
thunderstorm development is less certain given increasing
displacement from the stronger forcing for ascent. However, a
conditionally favorable environment for organized convection is
forecast, which should support a more isolated severe threat. 

...Tennessee Valley region...
A residual outflow boundary from Tuesday night's convection is
expected to push east through the morning hours, reaching the
eastern TN Valley into northern AL/MS by peak heating. Thunderstorm
development and/or re-intensification is possible - especially
across AL/MS/GA where latest CAMs show reasonable agreement in
redevelopment as SBCAPE increases to around 1500 J/kg. While
low-level flow is forecast to be weak, 30-40 knot westerlies aloft,
combined with steepening low-level lapse rates by late afternoon,
should support a few stronger cells/clusters with an attendant
hail/wind risk. 

...Southwest Missouri to Northeast Kansas...
An upper disturbance currently approaching northern MT is forecast
to migrate southeast over the next 48 hours. Surface pressure falls
over the Plains in response to the approach of this feature will
strengthen southerly low/mid-level winds on the western periphery of
a warm/moist air mass over the southern Plains/lower MS Valley -
especially by early evening as the nocturnal jet strengthens.
Concurrently, a cold air mass will begin migrating south along the
High Plains. Thunderstorms may develop within the warm advection
regime on the northern fringe of the returning moisture during the
00-06 UTC period across parts of the Ozark Plateau. A second round
is probable later overnight (during the 08-12 UTC period) as the
cold front impinges on the returning moisture across northeast KS.
For both regimes, sufficient deep-layer flow should be in place to
support organized cells with a severe hail risk.

Mesoscale Discussion 0448
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0713 PM CDT Mon Apr 15 2024

Areas affected...parts of western/central Kansas into south central
Nebraska

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 160013Z - 160245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Rapid thunderstorm development and intensification appears
probable at some point this evening, most likely by 10 PM-Midnight,
but perhaps an hour or two earlier.  Once storms form, a few
supercells  are likely posing a risk for large hail and tornadoes, a
couple of which could become strong. Trends are closely being
monitored for a watch issuance, which seems likely at some point,
though timing remains a bit unclear.

DISCUSSION...A significant mid-level trough and embedded low are in
the process of overspreading the the southern Rockies, with the
leading edge of stronger mid-level height falls beginning to impact
the high plains from the Texas Panhandle through the Black Hills
vicinity.  As intensifying southwesterly mid-level flow (in excess
of 90 kt around 500 mb) noses across the Texas Panhandle vicinity
through 02-04Z, strengthening mid/upper forcing for ascent likely
will increasingly interact with a retreating dryline across western
Kansas.  

As boundary-layer moisture, characterized by dew points increasing
as high as the lower/mid 60s, advects westward beneath steepening
lapse rates aided by cooling aloft, forecast soundings suggest
mixed-layer CAPE may increase in excess of 2000 J/kg within at least
a narrow corridor.  By mid to late evening, it appears that this
will roughly become focused along an axis from near Dodge City  KS
into areas west of Kearney NE.  

Some increase in high based convective development is already
evident to the west of the dryline across the Texas Panhandle into
western Kansas.  While guidance has generally been suggestive that
more substantive convective development and thunderstorm initiation 
may not commence until closer to the 03-05Z time frame, it is not
certain that this will not occur sooner.  Of primary concern, once
storms initiate, intensification may be rapid and include at least
one or two supercells with potential to produce strong tornadoes, as
boundary-layer moistening and destabilization coincide with
enlarging clockwise-curved hodographs beneath southerly 850 mb flow
strengthening in excess of 50 kt.

Mesoscale Discussion 0447
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0632 PM CDT Mon Apr 15 2024

Areas affected...parts of western Texas into far southwest OK

Concerning...Tornado Watch 110...

Valid 152332Z - 160100Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 110 continues.

SUMMARY...The severe risk continues. Developing storms across West
TX will remain capable of all hazards this evening. Broad cloud
cover may limit the threat farther east until more robust forcing
arrives from the west.

DISCUSSION...As of 2315 UTC, regional radar and satellite imagery
showed storms finally developing near the dryline over
west/southwest TX. Likely driven by diurnal mixing west of a broad
cirrus plume, these storms have struggled to maintain intensity over
the last hour due to remaining MLCINH. Continued heating west of the
cloud band may allow for additional development into the early
evening as more intense forcing for ascent from the west. The
environment remains capped, but moderately unstable with 2000-2500
J/kg of MLCAPE and dewpoints in the mid to upper 60s F. Strong
deep-layer shear would support supercellular organization with any
storms able to be sustained. Given the moderate buoyancy and shear,
large hail would be likely. 

Hi-res guidance suggests more robust development is possible closer
to sunset. Low-level flow is also forecast to increase potentially
increasing the tornado risk with any more sustained supercells that
become established. While uncertain on how much storm
development/coverage will occur in the near-term, the environment
remains favorable for severe weather into this evening.

Day 1 Convective Outlook

1130 AM CDT Mon Apr 15 2024

Valid 151630Z - 161200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE CENTRAL GREAT PLAINS AND CENTRAL AND EASTERN VIRGINIA...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are likely across parts of the Great
Plains, beginning mainly this evening and continuing overnight.
Several tornadoes, large to very large hail, and damaging wind gusts
all appear possible.  Strong tornadoes may occur this evening across
parts of Kansas and Nebraska.  Scattered severe gusts are probable
this afternoon into the evening across portions of Virginia.

...Synopsis...
Water-vapor imagery this morning shows a large, closed upper cyclone
over UT with this feature ejecting over the southern/central Plains
tonight.  A strong mid/upper-level jet will overspread much of the
southern/central Plains while a cyclone deepens over the High Plains
today.  Southerly low-level flow will facilitate moisture return
northward concurrent with a warm front advancing northward across
the central Great Plains.  A dryline is forecast to mix eastward
across the southern/central High Plains through peak afternoon
heating, before retreating westward this evening across parts of the
TX/OK Panhandles and western KS.

...Northern/Central Plains (Kansas/Nebraska/South Dakota)...
No appreciable change in thinking from the previous forecast in the
overall severe scenario for later today/tonight.  Capping will
likely inhibit storm initiation over the northern/central Plains
through at least late afternoon.  However, strong southerly
low-level flow will advect increasingly rich moisture northward with
upper 50s to low 60s surface dewpoints by early this evening across
the warm sector.  Prior to storm initiation, 2000-3000 J/kg MLCAPE
is forecast concurrent with strengthening mid/upper-level flow.  

Once convective initiation occurs (early evening), rapid supercell
development is expected as a LLJ intensifies.  Large to very large
hail (around 2-3 inches in diameter) will be a threat with any
supercells that can form along/near the warm front, or southward
along the length of the dryline into western KS.  Enlarged
hodographs during the evening will occur through midnight while some
additional increase in low-level moisture acts to counter increasing
CINH due to cooling surface temperatures.  If a few discrete
supercells can maintain a feed of effective near-surface inflow
parcels, the tornado risk will likely become focused with those
storms.  Given the strength of shear/buoyancy combination, strong
tornadoes appear possible this evening/tonight across portions of
KS/NE.  As additional storms develop, an evolving cluster growing
upscale will potentially yield severe gusts, most likely from
north-central KS into central NE overnight.  

...Southern Plains (Oklahoma/Texas)...
A lower coverage of storms is expected to develop farther south
along the dryline over parts of the southern Great Plains late this
afternoon into tonight.  Ample mid to high-level clouds will tend to
limit daytime heating to some extent along the length of the
dryline.  However, model guidance shows sufficient agreement in
depicting storm development across parts of northwest TX by late
this afternoon.  Supercells appear likely with this activity given
strong (50-60 kt) deep-layer shear and large buoyancy.  Isolated
large to very large hail will probably be the main threat with this
convection as it moves towards north-central TX. But, occasional
severe/damaging winds and perhaps a couple of tornadoes may also
occur through the early evening.  Most guidance indicates any
supercells which develop will weaken with eastward extent as they
encounter increasing MLCIN, and become increasingly displaced from
the better large-scale ascent with the upper trough/low ejecting
over the central Plains.  A highly conditional severe threat remains
apparent across OK late this afternoon and evening, with a favorable
parameter space to support supercells capable of producing all
severe hazards.  But, much of OK may have a relative minimum in
convective activity until late tonight as a Pacific cold front
overtakes the dryline.

...Lower OH Valley into the Mid-Atlantic states...
Morning surface mesoanalysis places a residual frontal zone draped
over central IN/OH with a low-level moisture reservoir (low 60s deg
F surface dewpoints) extending from the confluence of the MS/OH
rivers northeastward into the lower Wabash Valley.  Atop this
moisture, a plume of steep 700-500 mb lapse rates (8.0 to 8.3 deg
C/km) sampled at the Lincoln, IL and Wilmington, OH raob sites, will
overspread the OH Valley eastward into VA today.  The richer
low-level moisture will likely remain west of the Appalachians
across the lower OH Valley where 1500-2500 J/kg MLCAPE is forecast. 
Widely scattered thunderstorms are forecast to develop by mid
afternoon within the moist axis along/south of a stalled front over
the OH Valley.  Effective shear 25-35 kt will support a mix of
supercells and organized line segments capable of hail and wind.  

Farther east, steep lapse rates from the surface to 500 mb are
depicted in forecast soundings by early to mid afternoon (8 deg
C/km).  Although PW will be lower across the Mid-Atlantic region, a
more deeply mixed boundary layer is forecast with strong westerly
mid-level flow (40 kt).  Initial cellular storms will likely develop
over the higher terrain with subsequent development across northern
VA.  A band of storms posing a risk for severe gusts (60-70 mph) and
resultant wind damage is forecast.  Given the lapse rate profile
coupled with ample mid- to high-level flow and a linear mode, have
increased wind probabilities and an upgrade to level 3 categorical
outlook this update.  The overall severe threat should gradually
diminish through late evening with the loss of diurnal heating.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook

Valid 151700Z - 161200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN HIGH
PLAINS...

Morning observed soundings within the High Plains region showed
shallow moisture along with a shallow temperature inversion. This
should allow surface temperatures to rapidly rise into the afternoon
along with moisture mixing out quite efficiently. Widespread
critical fire weather is expected today. Extremely critical
conditions appear probable at least on a localized basis.

Within the Missouri Valley, morning surface observations already
show ongoing elevated to borderline critical conditions, which is
ahead of even the drier/windier deterministic model solutions. Given
pockets of receptive fuels, particularly with southwestern extent,
several hours of elevated to locally critical conditions are
possible. RH should eventually increase from southwest to northeast
as the warm front lifts northward with time.

..Wendt.. 04/15/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0202 AM CDT Mon Apr 15 2024/

...Synopsis...
An upper low and strong jet streak are forecast to intensify and
eject eastward over the Great Plains today and tonight. A lee low
should rapidly deepen over central High Plains with surface pressure
falls and the strong flow aloft bolstering strong surface winds over
much of the Plains. Hot and dry surface conditions atop drying fuels
will allow for widespread critical and localized extremely critical
fire-weather conditions.

...Southern and central High Plains...
As the main upper low phases with the subtropical jet, 70+ kt
mid-level flow will shift eastward and cross the Rockies late in the
afternoon and evening. The rapidly deepening lee low will force
strong west/southwest flow downslope over the High Plains behind a
dryline forecast to mix near 100 degrees west. Sustained surface
winds of 25-40 mph are possible behind the dryline given the strong
pressure falls and enhanced momentum transfer from increasing flow
aloft. Minimum RH values are also expected to be critically low,
falling to 10-15% over much of the High Plains. Widespread dry and
receptive fuels, combined with strong wind gusts and very dry
surface conditions, will support ubiquitous high-end critical
fire-weather concerns from eastern CO and western KS, into parts of
the Panhandles, and eastern NM/west TX. 

Localized extremely critical conditions also appear possible as
strong winds continue to increase into the late afternoon and
evening hours. The most likely corridors for localized extreme
conditions will exist from southeastern CO into parts of western KS
and the northwestern Panhandles, and across parts of the southwest
TX. Here, the overlap of the strongest flow aloft and single digit
RH is possible for a few hours late in the afternoon. Uncertainty on
the duration of extreme conditions remains too large to introduce
any Extremely Critical areas. Considerable uncertainty also exists
on the positioning of the dryline and the amount of mid and
high-level cloud cover. Will maintain a broader Elevated area to
capture the potential for more brief fire-weather conditions should
the dryline mix farther east.

...Missouri Valley...
Locally elevated fire weather conditions are possible in parts of
northwestern Iowa into southeast South Dakota this afternoon. Dry
air ahead of the warm front and gusty winds will increase prior to
precipitation arriving during the evening/overnight. With these
dry/windy conditions occurring primarily over marginally dry fuels
and over a limited duration, the threat is likely to remain
localized.
