Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0716 AM CDT Wed Sep 04 2024

Valid 041300Z - 051200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE CENTRAL ROCKIES INTO THE NORTHERN/CENTRAL PLAINS AND UPPER
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated strong to severe thunderstorms capable of gusty winds and
hail may occur this afternoon and evening across parts of the
central Rockies into the northern/central Plains and upper
Mississippi Valley.

...Central Rockies into the Northern/Central Plains and Upper
Mississippi Valley...
A weak shortwave trough over the northern Rockies and adjacent Great
Basin this morning will become absorbed later today into an
amplifying upper trough over the Canadian Prairie provinces and
northern Plains. At the surface, a cold front related to the upper
trough will continue southward over the northern Plains, and
southeastward across the Upper MS Valley through the period. Modest
low-level moisture is forecast to be in place ahead of this boundary
across the northern Plains and upper MS Valley, with more limited
moisture expected farther west across the central Rockies and
adjacent High Plains. Relatively cool mid-level temperatures
associated with the weak shortwave trough and the presence of steep
mid-level lapse rates should aid in the development of weak
instability across parts of WY, northern CO, and vicinity this
afternoon. Sufficient deep-layer shear (generally 25-35 kt) should
support some updraft organization with convection that initially
forms over the higher terrain before subsequently spreading
eastward. Isolated instances of marginally severe hail and
strong/gusty winds may occur with the more cellular development.
But, some increase in strong to severe wind potential may be
realized as thunderstorms move into an area of steeper low-level
lapse rates across the central High Plains by late this afternoon
and early evening, especially if any small clusters can form.

The severe potential along much of the length of the front in the
northern Plains and upper MS Valley appears rather conditional.
While large-scale ascent associated with the approaching upper
trough should gradually overspread the warm sector by late
afternoon/early evening, most guidance continues to suggest that a
cap and substantial MLCIN will hinder robust convection from
developing through much of the day. Even so, sufficient instability
and shear should be in place along/ahead of the front to support an
isolated hail/wind threat if thunderstorms can form and be sustained
through the evening and early overnight period. The post-frontal
regime across much of MT into ND and western SD appears unlikely to
support severe convection. Accordingly, the Marginal Risk has been
trimmed southward to account for recent guidance and observational
trends.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1219 PM CDT Tue Sep 03 2024

Valid 041200Z - 051200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS
OF THE CENTRAL ROCKIES...CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS...NORTHERN PLAINS...AND
THE MIDWEST....

...SUMMARY...
Isolated strong to severe storms are possible on Wednesday across
parts of the central and northern Rockies and Plains into parts of
Minnesota.

...Synopsis...
A broad, positively tilted trough with several embedded shortwave
troughs will become more consolidated and start to amplify across
the northern Plains on Wednesday and Wednesday night. At the
surface, a cold front will move southeast across the northern Plains
with scattered thunderstorms possible. The greater thunderstorm
coverage is expected during the afternoon/evening across the central
Rockies, beneath the coldest air aloft, and across northwest
Wisconsin/eastern Minnesota early Thursday morning as the low-level
jet intensifies along the frontal zone. 

...Central Rockies into the central High Plains...
Scattered to widespread thunderstorms are expected across the
central Rockies on Wednesday afternoon as cold air aloft (-12C at
500mb) combines with significant heating over the higher terrain.
The greatest instability will be near the center of the vorticity
maximum/cold air pocket where wind shear will be quite weak. Some
wind gusts or isolated large hail will be possible, but a more
organized threat seems unlikely. A more favorable wind profile will
exist along the southern periphery of this trough from eastern Utah
to southern Wyoming and northern Colorado. However, the warmer
temperatures aloft within this corridor may limit storm
coverage/intensity somewhat. Therefore, a few strong to locally
severe storms are possible from southern Montana to northern
Colorado, western Nebraska, and southwest South Dakota, however, a
displacement between the best instability and wind shear should keep
the threat somewhat limited.  

...Upper Midwest...
A mid-level shortwave trough will eject across the Dakotas, in the
vicinity of the cold front, during the day Wednesday. Therefore, a
few thunderstorms are possible along the cold front, but a lack of
better moisture should mostly limit the daytime thunderstorm threat.
However, as the low-level jet strengthens overnight, it will result
in some moistening between 850mb and 700mb which will likely result
in more widespread thunderstorm development after 06Z. During this
period, mid-level flow will also strengthen from around 25 knots to
near 35 knots by 12Z. This will improve the shear across the region
and therefore, result in some threat for large hail and damaging
wind gusts near sunrise as storms develop within a region of
moderate instability and 30 to 35 knots of shear.

..Thornton.. 09/03/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0102 AM CDT Tue Sep 03 2024/

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns will continue into today across parts of the
northern Great Basin/northern Rockies as well as the Plains. The
upper trough currently over OR is forecast to slowly shift east over
the next 24 hours, reaching the northern Rockies by early Wednesday.
As this occurs, breezy surface winds within the dry slot of the
maturing low will support dry/windy conditions across parts of NV
and ID. Over the Plains, a tightening surface pressure gradient will
maintain windy conditions through the afternoon, resulting in areas
of elevated to critical fire weather conditions. 

...Nevada into Idaho...
A pronounced dry slot is developing in low-level water-vapor imagery
across the northwestern Great Basin/southern OR as the upper low
continues to mature. This dry slot is forecast to spread east
through this afternoon, which will limit cloud and precipitation
chances for northern NV and central to eastern ID and help support
RH reductions into the teens. Numerous lightning strikes have been
observed over the past 24 hours across this region with GOES IR
imagery showing active large fires as of 05 UTC. This fire activity
demonstrates the very receptive nature of the current fuel landscape
(with the exception of the few locations that received wetting
rainfall), and any holdover fires that resulted from the recent
lightning activity may become more active today as west/southwest
winds increase by late afternoon. Latest deterministic and ensemble
solutions continue to suggest 15-20 mph winds will be common,
especially through the Snake River Plain of southern/eastern ID and
in the lee of the Independence and Ruby Mountains in northeast NV. A
few locations may see periods of critical wind/RH conditions, but
recent guidance suggests elevated conditions are more likely.

Away from the dry slot, isolated to scattered thunderstorms are
expected again today across the broader central/northern Rockies
region. Forecast storm motions near 30 knots and PWAT values between
0.6 to 0.8 inches suggest dry lightning strikes are possible.
However, higher MLCAPE values and lower LCL heights compared to
yesterday (Monday) are mitigating factors for predominantly dry
thunderstorms. Additionally, latest guidance shows a better QPF
signal compared to previous days, which further limits confidence in
the dry lightning threat. While this concern precludes risk
highlights, any lightning strike may support fire starts given the
very dry fuel conditions (ERCs above the 90th percentile).

...Wyoming into Nebraska and South Dakota...
Surface pressure has been steadily falling across western NE/SD over
the past 12-24 hours, and is expected to fall further through the
afternoon as a lee trough continues to deepen. This will maintain
breezy southerly winds across the central Plains as well as
strengthen westerly downslope flow across eastern WY this afternoon.
Downslope warming/drying will result in another day of 15-20% RH
minimums across eastern WY and far western NE/SD. Elevated fire
weather conditions appear likely within the downslope regime prior
to the arrival of clouds (and potentially showers/thunderstorms)
around early evening.

To the east, modest moisture return into the Plains is ongoing,
which will result in a zonal moisture gradient across the Plains by
mid afternoon. Recent solutions suggest that the strongest winds may
lie within this moisture gradient, resulting in a somewhat confined
corridor of elevated fire weather conditions where 15-25 mph winds
(gusting to 30-35 mph at times) will overlap with 15-25% RH values.
Although guidance occasionally struggles to accurately capture the
degree of boundary-layer mixing within these return flow regimes,
latest deterministic solutions appear to be capturing moisture
trends well and don't show substantial signs of a moist bias. This
lends confidence to the ongoing forecast of predominantly elevated
fire weather conditions across the region (although some locations
may see periods of critical conditions).

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1130 AM CDT Tue Sep 03 2024

Valid 031630Z - 041200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE NORTHERN ROCKIES/GREAT BASIN AND ADJACENT HIGH PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered thunderstorms developing across the northern Rockies and
adjacent portions of the Great Basin this afternoon may yield an
isolated severe risk, before spreading eastward toward the northern
High Plains this evening.

...Northern Great Basin/Rockies into the Adjacent High Plains...
Visible-satellite imagery this morning shows a smoke-encased mid to
upper-level low/vorticity maximum over central ID.  This upper
feature will move to near southwest MT/eastern ID late tonight.  The
satellite data late this morning shows agitated cumulus developing
immediately ahead of the vorticity max near the ID/MT border, and as
large-scale ascent spreads east, additional thunderstorms (widely
scattered to scattered coverage) should develop over the higher
terrain through early afternoon in tandem with daytime heating.

Forecast soundings across southwest MT into northwest WY show
500-1000 J/kg MLCAPE with some elongation of the hodograph.  A few
of the stronger storms will probably acquire transient supercell
characteristics and have an associated hail/wind threat.  Some
clustering may eventually evolve by early evening as storms move
into south-central MT and adjacent parts of northern WY.  

Somewhat more limited low-level moisture should be present this
afternoon farther south into WY and northern UT. Even so, diurnal
heating will aid in a deeply mixed boundary layer by this afternoon,
and steep mid-level lapse rates are also expected to remain over
this region. The net result will be high-based thunderstorms capable
of producing isolated severe gusts initially developing across
northern UT into far eastern ID, and subsequently moving
east-northeastward over WY through the evening.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0127 AM CDT Tue Sep 03 2024

Valid 041200Z - 051200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns are expected to be limited for Wednesday
across the country. The upper-level low currently over parts of the
Pacific Northwest is forecast to de-amplify and drift east into the
Plains. As this occurs, weak ascent will support widespread cloud
cover as well as isolated to scattered showers and thunderstorms
across the central Rockies to central Plains. The surface pressure
trough currently in place along the High Plains will shift
east/southeast through the day, and while breezy conditions are
likely just ahead of the boundary, increasing moisture return into
the Plains will modulate diurnal RH reductions. Across the West,
building surface high pressure should limit wind speeds.
Consequently, the potential for elevated fire weather concerns
appears limited with no highlights required.

At 800 AM HST (1800 UTC), the broad mean center of elongating 
Tropical Storm Hone and an extratropical low was located near 
latitude 25.3 North, longitude 178.3 West. Hone is moving toward 
the west-northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h). This general motion with 
a decrease in forward speed is expected today as Hone merges with 
the extratropical low. A turn toward the north and an increase in 
forward speed is expected to resume on Monday. On the forecast 
track, Hone, or the extratropical low associated with Hone, will be 
passing near or just west of Kure Atoll near the International Date 
Line late Monday or Monday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher
gusts. Little change in strength is forecast during the next 48
hours.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area
Monday and Monday night.
 
RAINFALL: Storm total rainfall of 2 to 4 inches is possible over
Midway and Kure Atolls.

Mesoscale Discussion 2041
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1254 PM CDT Sun Sep 01 2024

Areas affected...parts of western and northern New York

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 011754Z - 011930Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...A broken line of storms may produce occasional gusty wind
this afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Inhibition has been mostly eroded across western and
northern New York as temperatures have warmed to the upper 70s to
low 80s with mid 60s dewpoints. Expect scattered thunderstorms to
develop along a cold front once it moves east of Lake Erie and Lake
Ontario. Storms may be not be that deep given the relatively shallow
thermodynamic profile shown by the RAP forecast soundings. However,
relatively strong flow through the column and a well-mixed boundary
layer may support efficient transport of gusty winds to the surface
within these storms. Isolated damaging wind gusts are possible
through the afternoon with this threat waning near sunset.

Tropical Storm Hone Discussion Number  41
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012024
500 AM HST Sun Sep 01 2024
 
The satellite presentation of Hone has become very ragged overnight, 
with the low-level circulation center becoming very difficult to 
locate with much confidence. An 1130z Oceansat-3 pass indicated 
that the low level center of Hone has shifted west-westward since 
the previous and appears to be merging with the mid-level low just 
east of the International Date Line. The latest subjective Dvorak 
current intensity estimates from PHFO, SAB, and JTWC, all came in 
at 2.5 (35 kt), while the objective intensity estimates were 
similar. As a result, the initial intensity has been held at a 
perhaps generous 35 kt for this advisory.
 
The initial motion is quite uncertain due to the low-level of Hone 
being in the process of merging with the mid-level low to the 
west, and is set at 300/12 kt. This general motion is expected 
to  continue today and tonight along with a decrease in forward 
speed as Hone merges with a mid-level low to the west.  Hone should 
begin moving northward with an increase in forward speed Monday and 
Monday night as it moves into a weakness in building mid-level 
ridges to the northwest and east of the system. A shift back toward 
the northwest is then expected late Tuesday through Thursday as a 
low and mid-level ridge builds to the north of Hone. The latest 
track forecast was adjusted to better align with the latest model 
guidance and generally follows the TVCE consensus.
 
Hone will be in a relatively favorable environment during the next
couple days, with warm sea surface temperatures and low vertical
wind shear. The interaction with a mid-level low, ragged LLCC and
entrainment of dry mid-level air should act to minimize the
potential for intensification however. Beyond 48 hours mid-level
moisture drops off considerably and the latest simulated satellite
imagery from the GFS and ECMWF suggest a loss of deep convection by
72 hours. As a result, the intensity forecast holds Hone as a 35 
kt Tropical Storm during the next couple days, with the cyclone 
expected to become a post-tropical remnant low by 72 hours, and 
dissipation occurring by 120 hours. The intensity forecast closely 
follows the latest intensity consensus guidance.
