Mesoscale Discussion 0869
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1027 AM CDT Tue May 21 2024

Areas affected...Eastern NE...Western IA...Far Southeast SD

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 211527Z - 211730Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Fast-moving supercells capable of all severe hazards will
be possible, including large to very large hail, strong gusts up to
70 mph, and tornadoes. A Tornado Watch will likely be needed for
portions of the area with in the next hour or two.

DISCUSSION...Recent surface analysis places the primary surface low
over north-central KS (just southwest of CNK), with a warm front
extending northeastward into southeast NE and then more
east-northeastward across southern IA. A cold front also extends
from this low southwestward through central KS and the eastern OK
Panhandle. There is a secondary surface low farther north near the
IA/SD/MN border intersection, with weak surface troughing connecting
these two lows. 

Given the position of the surface features, the recent thunderstorm
activity along the central NE/KS border is likely elevated,
initiated by strong ascent attendant to the approaching shortwave
trough. However, as the primary surface low moves quickly
northeastward, and the warm front correspondingly moves northward,
the airmass across eastern NE and western IA (particularly
east-central/southeast NE and west-central/southwest IA) is expected
to become increasingly supportive of surface-based storms. Within
the warm sector, fast-moving supercells capable of all severe
hazards will be possible, including large to very large hail, strong
gusts up to 70 mph, and tornadoes. Large hail and strong gusts will
be possible with the elevated storms as well. Given this severe
potential, a Tornado Watch will likely be needed for portions of the
area with in the next hour or two.

Mesoscale Discussion 0868
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0929 AM CDT Tue May 21 2024

Areas affected...Central/Eastern IA...Far Southwest WI...Far
Northwest IL

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 275...

Valid 211429Z - 211600Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 275
continues.

SUMMARY...Threat for damaging gusts will continue across central and
eastern IA for the next few hours.

DISCUSSION...A convective line continues over central IA, with
recent storm motion estimated to be northeastward at 40-45 kt. This
motion takes the line into more of eastern IA between 15Z and 16Z.
Recent surface analysis places a warm front from far southwest IA
northeastward to south of CID and then eastward into northern IL.
The ongoing convective line is currently north of this boundary,
with the elevated character to this line likely contributing to the
lack of measured surface gusts. The southwest-to-northeast
orientation of the warm front and its somewhat slow motion north
coupled with the predominantly northeastward motion of the line
casts some doubt to whether or not this line will be able to evolve
towards a more surface-based character with eastern extent. If it
does, some trend towards stronger and more frequent gusts is
possible. Even if the line remains elevated, the overall environment
is expected to improve as it moves downstream, with damaging gusts
remaining possible. 

Additionally, given the improving environmental conditions
anticipated, overall convective trends will be monitored for
potential downstream watch issuance into northwest IL and southwest
WI.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0800 AM CDT Tue May 21 2024

Valid 211300Z - 221200Z

...THERE IS A MODERATE RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER MUCH OF IA
AND NEARBY PARTS OF SOUTHEASTERN
MINNESOTA...WISCONSIN...ILLINOIS...AND MISSOURI...

...SUMMARY...
An outbreak of severe thunderstorms, including the potential for
strong tornadoes, is expected mainly this afternoon to early
evening.  The greatest threat is over Iowa and parts of adjacent
states.

...Synopsis...
In mid/upper levels, a persistent, slow-moving cyclone will meander
over southern SK through the period, while a separate closed low
digs southeastward from northern BC to WA.  These will anchor a mean
trough extending from the northern Rockies across southern CA and
offshore from northern Baja.  In the downstream southwesterlies, a
shortwave trough was evident in moisture-channel imagery over the
High Plains from western NE to northeastern NM.  This perturbation
should pivot northeastward to southern MN, central IA and
northwestern MO by 00Z, then northeastward over western and northern
parts of the upper Great Lakes by 12Z tomorrow.

At the surface, 11Z analysis showed lows near SUX and CNK, along a
cold front arching to southwestern KS and the Raton Mesa.  The lows
should consolidate today into a more-coherent cyclone center and
move to southern MN by 00Z, with cold front to southeastern IA,
central MO, and central OK, becoming quasistationary to warm across
western OK and the northern TX Panhandle, to a low in southeastern
CO.  A dryline -- initially analyzed from a frontal intersection
over west-central KS south-southwestward to between MAF-FST, should
shift eastward today over southern/central OK, northwest/west-
central TX, and the Edwards Plateau.  By 12Z, the low should become
occluded over the Boundary Waters region, with cold front across
Lower MI, southern IL, southeastern MO, southern OK, northwest TX,
and southeastern NM.

...Upper Mississippi to lower Missouri Valleys...
An ongoing, organized band of thunderstorms, with a history of
producing several measured severe gusts in central/eastern NE --
will sweep across parts of IA through the remainder of the morning. 
This activity will overtake isolated strong-severe convection near
the outflow boundary, where relatively maximized low-level vorticity
and instability will be most strongly juxtaposed.  Severe gusts,
sporadic large hail, and a tornado or two all are possible.  See SPC
Severe Thunderstorm Watch 275 and related mesoscale discussions for
near-term guidance on this threat.

That activity is a precursor to the main event, which is expected to
sweep across much of the same areas (and portions of adjoining
states) from midday through the evening.  Scattered to numerous
thunderstorms (including multiple fast-moving supercells) are
expected to form over parts of eastern NE from midday into early
afternoon, and over IA and northern/central MO this afternoon.  This
will occur as the cold front impinges on a retreating outflow
boundary from the morning storms, and an airmass destabilizing
rapidly on both sides of the boundary from a combination of diurnal
heating and intense warm advection.  Sufficient airmass recovery for
a surface-based, all-hazards severe threat is expected across most
of IA and probably into southern MN as well, spreading into parts of
western/northern IL and WI ahead of the main convective arc. 
Several tornadoes -- some strong (EF2+ damage potential) are
possible, along with large, damaging hail and severe downdrafts. 
Given potential for cell motions of 45-50 kt, potential exists for a
few long-track mesocyclones/tornadoes.

The approach of the shortwave trough will increase large-scale lift
-- now evident with post-frontal convection over southwestern NE and
northwestern KS that may be trackable across southern NE to the
earliest substantial convection in the midday hours.  The ascent
should spread over the region, atop that from the front and surface
heating, supporting the development of steep low/middle-level lapse
rates.  With surface dewpoints recovering into the upper 60s to
around 70 F, a corridor of 2000-3000 J/kg MLCAPE should develop over
much of IA, with slightly weaker (but still favorable) values
clipping parts of southern MN as well.  Activity should begin to
gradually outrun the corridor of favorable surface-based buoyancy in
the evening after crossing the Mississippi River, but may remain
well-organized in terms of severe-wind threat across Lake Michigan. 
The largest low-level hodographs should be near and north of the
remnant outflow boundary, with effective SRH exceeding 300 J/kg --
but will be favorable for potentially tornadic supercells farther
south into southern IA and parts of MO as well.

...Ozarks to south Texas...
Isolated to scattered thunderstorms are expected to form from
midafternoon into evening near the front and dryline, offering large
to very large hail and locally severe gusts.  Hail at least 3 inches
in diameter is possible.  A tornado or two is not out of the
question -- especially in northern areas (Ozarks vicinity) under the
fringes of the gradient-flow/deep-shear influence from the ejecting
shortwave trough -- and with high-CAPE storm-scale processes amid
favorable deep shear elsewhere.

Though capping from an EML will limit convective potential for much
of the day, a combination of strong surface heating, rich boundary-
layer moisture, and frontal/dryline lift will weaken MLCINH enough
by mid/late afternoon to support deep convective development.  Upper
60s to low 70s F surface dewpoints should become common beneath a
high equilibrium level (deep troposphere) and steep midlevel lapse
rates, supporting a corridor of 3000-4000 J/kg MLCAPE (locally
higher).  Sufficient veering of winds with height, and effective-
shear magnitudes in the 45-60 kt range, will support supercell
potential.  Activity over TX my weaken within a few hours after
sunset as nocturnal boundary-layer cooling re-establishes the strong
capping beneath the EML.  However, farther north across parts of
AR/MO, a weaker EML influence may permit activity to persist later
and farther east this evening, before weakening.

...Adirondacks region to northern New England...
Widely scattered to scattered thunderstorms should develop over
portions of the Adirondacks and White Mountains today, and perhaps
also move into the area from nearby parts of extreme eastern ON and
southernmost QC.  Damaging gusts and isolated severe hail will be
possible.

A mid/upper-level shortwave trough and embedded MCV -- related to
the significantly severe MCS over KS two days ago -- is apparent in
satellite imagery over Lake Huron.  This feature will move eastward
toward northern NY/New England and times well with the diurnal-
heating cycle there.  Activity should form as large-scale DCVA/lift
and enhancement of midlevel flow -- preceding the MCV/shortwave
trough -- spread atop a destabilized, suitably moist boundary layer,
heated to convective temperature over elevated terrain.  These
processes will erode MLCINH to negligible levels, fostering MLCAPE
commonly in the 1000-1500 J/kg range, locally/briefly near 2000
J/kg.  Deep shear should remain modest, with effective-shear
magnitudes generally 25-35 kt, though enough veering with height in
low levels may develop to shape somewhat enlarged hodographs. 
Multicell and transient supercell modes should predominate, with the
severe threat diminishing markedly after dark.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 275
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
615 AM CDT Tue May 21 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Central and southern Iowa

* Effective this Tuesday morning and afternoon from 615 AM until
  100 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 75
    mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Clusters of thunderstorms -- including an organized bowing
complex initially over eastern NE -- will pose a threat mainly for
severe gusts while crossing the watch area from west to east.  A
tornado or two cannot be ruled out, especially near an outflow
boundary draped across central/south-central IA.  Isolated large
hail is possible.  This is a precursor to the main severe-weather
threat expected later today, for which we have a "Moderate Risk"
outlook.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 60
statute miles north and south of a line from 80 miles west of Des
Moines IA to 25 miles south southeast of Cedar Rapids IA. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU5).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 274...

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
1.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 65 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 550. Mean storm motion vector
26045.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0222 AM CDT Tue May 21 2024

Valid 221200Z - 231200Z

...Synopsis...
A broad upper trough will encompass the central and western CONUS
Wednesday. The strongest mid-level flow is expected to extend from
the Southern Plains through the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes
regions, and across the Pacific Northwest near the base of mid-level
cyclone. A deeply mixed air mass will remain present over the Desert
Southwest, while a cold front dives southward into portions of the
Southern and High Plains. Further west across portions of NM and AZ,
sustained westerly surface winds near 15 mph are expected where
increasingly receptive fuels and single-digit RH will be present.
Localized wind speeds may briefly approach or exceed 20 mph across
southern NM Wednesday afternoon, but the probability of this
occurring for more than 3 hours across a broad region is too low to
introduce a Critical area at this time.

Mesoscale Discussion 0859
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0825 PM CDT Mon May 20 2024

Areas affected...parts of southwestern Nebraska and adjacent
northern Kansas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 210125Z - 210300Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...An intensifying supercell and perhaps small upscale
growing convective cluster appears likely to continue developing
eastward along a frontal zone into portions of southwestern Nebraska
and adjacent northern Kansas through 10 PM-Midnight CDT.  This will
be accompanied by increasing potential for large hail, severe wind
gusts and a few tornadoes.  A new watch likely will be issued within
the next hour or so.

DISCUSSION...More substantive intensification of convection across
northeastern Colorado is now underway, including one supercell now
propagating eastward across the Akron CO vicinity.  As activity
continues eastward, strengthening easterly low-level updraft inflow
will become increasingly unstable with deeper progression into the
plains.  This likely will support further upscale growth, including,
at least initially, an enlarging supercell, then perhaps a gradually
upscale growing cluster focused along the baroclinic zone (roughly
centered around 700 mb) extending eastward near/north of the
Kansas/Nebraska border vicinity.

Mesoscale Discussion 0860
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0923 PM CDT Mon May 20 2024

Areas affected...Northern Iowa and southern Minnesota

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 272...

Valid 210223Z - 210400Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 272
continues.

SUMMARY...Discrete supercells capable of producing large hail up to
2.0 inches in diameter remain possible across northern IA this
evening. Damaging wind gusts could also accompany collapsing
thunderstorms.

DISCUSSION...A couple of discrete, right moving supercells have
evolved this evening over Cherokee, Clay, and Palo Alto Counties.
Recent FSD VAD profiler data indicates deep layer shear magnitudes
around 50 kt. Although slightly weaker shear is likely present
further east and southeast, where ongoing supercells are persisting,
the discrete nature of them along a nearly stationary boundary may
be supporting localized storm pressure perturbations capable of
significant updraft velocities. In addition, steep mid-level lapse
rates/large CAPE within the hail growth zone (00Z OAX sounding) is
also contributing larger hail potential. However, as MLCINH
continues to increase updraft strength should slowly diminish and
hail sizes should decrease. The severe threat will continue through
the late evening hours along and just behind the surface front,
where some elevated supercells will also be possible.

  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 60 mph possible
  Scattered large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Scattered thunderstorm development is expected this
evening along a slow moving front across southern Minnesota and
northern Iowa.  The storm environment will favor a mix of multicell
clusters and storms with supercell structure capable of producing
large hail of 1-1.5 inches in diameter and damaging outflow gusts up
to 60 mph.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 45
statute miles north and south of a line from 35 miles east of
Rochester MN to 50 miles west of Storm Lake IA. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU2).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

* Primary threats include...
  A few tornadoes likely with a couple intense tornadoes possible
  Scattered damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 80
    mph likely
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 3
    inches in diameter likely

SUMMARY...Clusters of intensifying supercells across northeast
Colorado will continue eastward into Kansas/Nebraska with some
potential for upscale growth tonight.  The storm environment will
favor all significant hazards of all types (tornadoes capable of EF2
damage, very large hail up to 3 inches in diameter, and severe
outflow winds up to 80 mph).

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 55 statute miles
north and south of a line from 25 miles west of Imperial NE to 35

Day 1 Convective Outlook

0759 PM CDT Mon May 20 2024

Valid 210100Z - 211200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS IN THE CENTRAL
HIGH PLAINS ACROSS SOUTHERN NE...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are expected through tonight from the
central High Plains to parts of the Upper Midwest. The greatest
concentration of tornadoes, large hail, and severe wind is expected
over northeast Colorado into southern Nebraska, and far northwest
Kansas. This will include potential for a strong tornado, very large
hail, and significant severe gusts.

...01Z Update...
Primary concern is with ongoing convection developing across
northeast CO into the southwest NE Panhandle. With a current of east
to southeast 0-1 km winds expected to increase during the next few
hours, afternoon CAM guidance along with recent WoFS runs are
insistent on long-lived supercell development along the southern
flank of the thunderstorm plume. This appears likely to emanate out
of the Akron, CO vicinity and move east towards the CO/KS/NE border
area. With low 60s surface dew points across northwest KS marking
the northwest extent of MLCAPE in excess of 1500 J/kg, a supercell
or two impinging on the increasingly buoyant airmass downstream, may
become intense. In addition to the risk for very large hail,
enlarging low-level hodographs will support potential for cyclic
tornadogenesis, especially in the 02-05Z time frame. Transition from
tornadic supercell to a bow will likely occur during the late
evening to early morning, with probable movement along the
pronounced MLCAPE gradient into at least south-central NE.
Increasingly large MLCIN is anticipated overnight across KS,
suggesting that the severe wind swath will remain latitudinally
confined. Downstream convection, ongoing across southeast NE,
suggests the upstream severe wind threat may wane somewhat near dawn
as the MCS approaches the Mid-MO Valley. But the potential for a
well-organized MCS to persist across much of southern NE is apparent
and warrants expansion of the level 3-ENH risk.

Elsewhere, scattered large hail and sporadic severe wind gusts
should occur this evening into the early overnight from southeast NE
to southeast MN. A lower-end QLCS across Lower MI into northwest IN
may produce locally damaging winds with strong gusts through the
rest of this evening. But this convection will likely diminish
overnight.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0449 PM CDT Mon May 20 2024

Valid 221200Z - 281200Z

...Southwest into the southern High Plains...

...Days 3-4/Wednesday-Thursday...
A broad large-scale trough will persist across the West, with the
strongest midlevel flow confined to the northwestern CONUS. Along
the southern periphery of the trough, moderate west-southwesterly
flow will overspread a dry/deeply mixed air mass from the Southwest
into the southern High Plains. As a result, elevated to locally
critical conditions are expected each afternoon, given increasingly
dry/receptive fuels across the region. 40-percent Critical
probabilities remain in place for these days, though confidence in
any more than locally critical conditions is too low to introduce
higher probabilities at this time. 

...Days 5-6/Friday-Saturday...
On Day 5/Friday, west-southwesterly midlevel flow will strengthen
across the Southwest, where a warm/dry antecedent air mass will be
in place. Given the strengthening midlevel flow and a modest surface
pressure gradient, critical conditions are expected on Day 5/Friday
over northeast AZ and northwest NM. Thereafter, a robust midlevel
jet streak embedded in the west-southwesterlies will overspread the
Southwest and southern High Plains on Day 6/Saturday. This will
promote another day of dry/windy conditions across the region, with
the best overlap of strong surface winds and low RH atop receptive
fuels expected over southern NM, where critical conditions are
expected. 

Elevated to locally critical conditions will likely continue on Day
7/Sunday, though midlevel flow will be slightly weaker than days
prior -- precluding 70-percent probabilities at this time.

Mesoscale Discussion 0851
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1237 PM CDT Mon May 20 2024

Areas affected...the Michigan Thumb vicinity

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 201737Z - 201930Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Strong to severe storms capable of isolated damaging wind
and hail are possible this afternoon.

DISCUSSION...A cluster of storms has recently intensified near the
Thumb region of Michigan. While low-level moisture is relatively
limited, strong heating is occurring downstream of this cluster,
supporting MUCAPE of near or above 1000 J/kg. Deep-layer shear is
rather modest, but unidirectional southwesterly flow may support
some organization with this cluster as it moves northeastward
through the afternoon. Steepening low-level lapse rates will support
a threat for strong/damaging outflow gusts, while stronger embedded
cells may be capable of producing some hail. In addition, isolated
strong storm development cannot be ruled out later this afternoon to
the southwest of the ongoing cluster, along a trailing surface
boundary.

1258 PM CDT Mon May 20 2024

Valid 211200Z - 221200Z

...THERE IS A MODERATE RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS SOUTHERN
IOWA...NORTHWEST ILLINOIS AND FAR NORTHEAST MISSOURI...

...SUMMARY...
Severe storms are expected Tuesday across the Midwest, especially
including portions of Iowa and Missouri into Wisconsin and
western/northern Illinois. Tornadoes (a few strong), damaging wind
gusts, and large hail are expected.

...Lower/Middle Missouri Valley to the Upper Great Lakes...
A notably strong belt of cyclonically curved westerlies (70+ kt 500
mb) will extend from the south-central Great Plains to the Upper
Midwest and Upper Great Lakes on Tuesday, with a lead/convectively
augmented shortwave trough likely to spread from the central High
Plains toward the Lake Superior vicinity late Tuesday night. An
elongated surface low over eastern Nebraska Tuesday morning will
deepen and lift northeast to northern Wisconsin/Upper Michigan by
evening, with a surface warm front lifting northward ahead of the
surface low, although its effective position will likely be
influenced by the early day precipitation. Meanwhile, a trailing
cold front will surge east across Iowa/eastern Kansas/northern
Missouri from mid-afternoon into the evening.

Remnant clusters of storms will likely be ongoing Tuesday morning
across central/eastern Nebraska, with the possibility of additional
storms farther east across southern Iowa/northern Missouri in
association with a warm-advection regime. Some key uncertainties
persist about the influences of this early day convection, but
trends will be for quick air mass recovery given a
progressive/highly dynamic pattern.

Very steep mid-level lapse rates will overspread the increasingly
moist warm sector, supporting aggressive diurnal destabilization
especially on the southern fringe of lingering convection/cloud
cover. Significantly strengthening mid-level winds and a diurnally
persistent strong low-level jet will support initial supercells
capable of large hail and a few tornadoes, including strong (EF2+)
tornado potential. But a mixed/transitional mode is expected
overall, as upscale growth occurs given the degree of forcing for
ascent, with likely evolution into a well-organized/fast-moving QLCS
capable of increasingly widespread/intense damaging winds and a
continued QLCS-related tornado risk. This scenario currently appears
to be most probable across southern/eastern Iowa into northwest
Illinois and nearby far northern Missouri. The severe risk will
persist into the Upper Great Lakes region and middle Mississippi
Valley overnight.

...Southern Plains...
Convective coverage will likely decrease with southward extent as
large-scale ascent focuses northward toward the Great Lakes.
Nevertheless isolated storms are possible into northeast
Oklahoma/northwest Arkansas by late afternoon/evening, and more
conditionally with southwest extent near a dryline from central
Oklahoma into central Texas. Large hail and severe gusts will be
possible with this activity.

...Northeast States...
A weak upper shortwave trough will move across southern Quebec and
northern New England. This will result in a band of enhanced
westerly deep-layer flow from northern New York into Maine. A
seasonally moist airmass will be in place with surface dewpoints
into the low 60s F, with strong heating and steepening low-level
lapse rates. MLCAPE to around 1000 J/kg and effective shear
magnitudes around 35 kt will support organized cells. Elongated
hodographs and favorable vertical shear suggest marginally severe
hail will be possible along with locally damaging wind gusts.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0202 AM CDT Mon May 20 2024/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level jet streak will overspread the Southwest this afternoon
as a mid-level trough amplifies across the western CONUS. A deeply
mixed boundary layer is expected across Arizona and New Mexico with
temperatures in the 90s. Some of this stronger flow will mix to the
surface amid the deep boundary layer. In addition, lee cyclogenesis
will tighten the pressure gradient in the region and aid in stronger
surface winds. Sustained surface winds of 25 to 30 mph are expected
across New Mexico with some sustained winds over 30 mph in northern
Arizona. Single-digit relative humidity is also expected across most
of the region. Fuels have started to dry to critical levels across
portions of eastern and northern Arizona. Therefore, a Critical
delineation is warranted.

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PORTIONS
OF THE CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
NORTHERN ILLINOIS AND SOUTHERN WISCONSIN...

...SUMMARY...
The primary threat for severe thunderstorms today will be over parts
of the central Plains, with large hail, damaging wind gusts, and a
few tornadoes possible.

...Central High Plains...
A large upper trough will slowly deepen across the western United
States today, with strengthening southwesterly mid/upper level flow
spreading across the Plains states.  A band of mid-level moisture
and instability will result in scattered high-based thunderstorms
across northern CO/southern WY by mid-afternoon, capable of locally
damaging wind gusts.  Other discrete supercell storms may form in
vicinity of the DCVZ as southeasterly low-level winds and elevated
terrain aid in initiation.  These storms will track
east-northeastward into a progressively more moist/unstable air
mass, with the risk of very large hail and a few tornadoes through
the evening.  By mid-evening, coverage of storms will increase over
southwest NE as a southerly low-level jet strengthens, with storms
progressing across the central Plains overnight with a continued
risk of large hail and damaging winds.

...IL/WI...
A well-defined remnant MCV from overnight convection over KS is
currently over northeast IA.  A surface boundary extends eastward
from the low across northern IL.  Broken clouds and partial
afternoon heating will aid in the development of thunderstorms near
the MCV later today as it tracks across southern WI/northern IL. 
Any storm that can interact with the boundary would have the
potential to become a supercell and pose a risk of a tornado or two.
 Otherwise, hail and gusty winds could occur with the strongest
cells.

...Southeast FL...
Widely scattered afternoon thunderstorms are possible across
southeast FL.  Ample low-level moisture, strong heating, cyclonic
midlevel flow, and relatively steep lapse rates could result in a
strong storm or two capable of gusty winds and hail.
