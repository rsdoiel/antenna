Mesoscale Discussion 1963
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0720 AM CDT Sat Aug 16 2025

Areas affected...Southeast MN into western WI

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 595...

Valid 161220Z - 161345Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 595
continues.

SUMMARY...Some threat for locally damaging wind and isolated hail
may continue into mid morning.

DISCUSSION...An earlier compact bowing MCS has largely weakened this
morning across southern/central MN, after encountering extensive
preceding convection. A larger and more loosely organized MCS is
ongoing, aided in part by the remnant cold pool from the earlier
system. Favorable MUCAPE (2000-3000 J/kg) will help to maintain the
ongoing convection as it moves into western WI, though low-level
stability and strong MLCINH is expected to keep the short-term
damaging-wind threat rather isolated. Isolated hail also cannot be
ruled out with the strongest embedded cores. 

While cloudiness is extensive across the region, modest diurnal
heating may eventually allow for some intensification along the
southern and eastern periphery of the ongoing convection with time.
However, a more substantial uptick in the organized severe threat
may not evolve until late this morning or into the afternoon. In the
short term, WW issuance downstream of WW 595 is unlikely, unless
notable intensification occurs over the next 60-90 minutes.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging winds likely with isolated significant gusts
    to 85 mph possible
  Scattered large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...A fast-moving and intense cluster of thunderstorms over
southeast South Dakota will race eastward across the watch area
during the next several hours.  Locally damaging wind gusts,
including some potential for significant wind damage is expected.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 60
statute miles north and south of a line from 70 miles northwest of
Worthington MN to 40 miles southeast of Minneapolis MN. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU5).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 594...

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0721 AM CDT Sat Aug 16 2025

Valid 161300Z - 171200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON AND
TONIGHT OVER PARTS OF SOUTH DAKOTA...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong/severe thunderstorms are possible today into
tonight across parts of the northern Great Plains into Midwest and
Great Lakes region.

...MN/Great Lakes Region...
A long-lived severe MCS that affected parts of SD and southwest MN
overnight has weakened in east-central MN.  These storms will track
eastward this morning into a region of moderate MUCAPE, but slightly
cooler/drier surface air over WI that was affected by one or more
areas of thunderstorms yesterday.  For this reason, these storms are
expected to struggle to organize, with locally gusty winds being the
main concern today.  Refer to MCD #1963 for further short-term
details.

Farther south across parts of IA/IL/IN, an overnight MCS pushed the
effective surface boundary south into northeast MO and central IL. 
Strong daytime heating and southerly low-level winds will help the
boundary to retreat back into northern IA/IL by mid-afternoon.  The
corridor along/north of the boundary should provide the greatest
potential for re-development of a few storms later today, with
locally damaging wind gusts possible.  Given the uncertainty of
where the boundary is, and anticipated limited coverage of storms,
will maintain MRGL risk at this time.

...SD and Vicinity...
A well-defined but rather weak shortwave trough is currently over
western CO and will spread into eastern WY/western Dakotas by
evening.  Similar to yesterday, high-based storms will develop ahead
of the approaching trough and intensify as they move eastward into a
progressively more moist/unstable air mass over west-central SD. 
Another nocturnal MCS may affect central/eastern SD tonight, with a
risk of damaging wind gusts and some hail.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0356 AM CDT Sat Aug 16 2025

Valid 191200Z - 241200Z

...DISCUSSION...
...Tuesday/Day 4 and Wednesday/Day 5...
A mid-level ridge will build across the Rockies and northern High
Plains during the middle part of the week. At the surface, a front
will advance slowly southward into the lower Missouri and mid
Mississippi Valleys. A post-frontal airmass will remain over the 
upper Mississippi and Great Lakes region. On the southern and
western periphery of this airmass, moderate instability is forecast
to develop each afternoon. Limited large-scale ascent is expected to
keep convective coverage isolated. In spite of relatively weak
deep-layer shear along much of the instability corridor, steep low
to mid-level lapse rates will be in place and could be enough for a
marginal severe threat in areas that destabilize the most.

...Thursday/Day 6 and Saturday/Day 8...
Mid-level zonal flow is forecast to develop on Thursday over much of
the north-central and northwestern U.S., as a ridge moves
southeastward into the western Great Lakes. A pocket of moderate
instability is forecast to develop ahead of a cold front on Thursday
in the northern Plains. Limited large-scale ascent should keep
convective coverage isolated. Although deep-layer shear is forecast
to be modest, any cell that can develop and persist near the
stronger instability in the late afternoon and early evening could
obtain an isolated severe threat.

On Friday an Saturday, a cold front is forecast to move
southeastward across the north-central U.S. Near and ahead of the
front, isolated thunderstorms will be possible each afternoon from
the upper Mississippi Valley into the Great Lakes region. The
combination of instability and shear could be sufficient for an
isolated severe threat. However, considerable uncertainty exists at
this range in the forecast.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0204 AM CDT Sat Aug 16 2025

Valid 171200Z - 181200Z

...Synopsis...
Across the US, broad ridging is forecast to expand while troughing
consolidates over the West. As height aloft build, very warm surface
temperatures are expected over parts of the southern and
Southwestern CONUS. A belt of stronger flow aloft will impinge on
the northern Rockies as the trough and a weak surface cold front
approach. Monsoon moisture should support dry thunderstorms, while
light winds and dry conditions will persist elsewhere Sunday.

...Northern Rockies Dry Thunder...
Troughing should continue to intensify as it moves into the Great
Basin and Rockies Sunday, as a cold front moves in from the west.
This will allow for additional monsoon moisture to filter northward,
supporting scattered showers and thunderstorms through the
afternoon. Despite PWATs climbing to near 0.8 to 1 inches, a mix of
wet and dry thunderstorms is expected ahead of the front from
northern CA into the Northern Rockies. While not as dry as previous
days, stronger flow aloft is expected ahead of the deepening trough.
This should allow for a favorable alignment of drier/more receptive
fuels and faster northeast thunderstorm motions to limit rainfall
across northern NV into central ID and western MT. Thus, isolated
dry lightning and ignitions are likely to remain a concern across
the receptive fuels beds of the northern Great Basin and Rockies
Sunday.

...Southern NV into southwest UT
South of the western US troughing and stronger flow aloft, another
day of dry and locally breezy conditions is expected over parts of
the southern Great Basin. While displaced from the stronger flow,
localized 15 mph surface winds and low RH below 15% are likely
across southern NV and southwest UT. With area fuels very dry and
receptive, some locally elevated fire-weather conditions are
possible, though widespread occurrence is unlikely owing to the
modest winds.

Mesoscale Discussion 1956
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0552 PM CDT Fri Aug 15 2025

Areas affected...portions of eastern/southeastern Iowa into
northwestern Illinois

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 590...

Valid 152252Z - 160015Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 590
continues.

SUMMARY...A well organized bowing cluster should continue across
southeastern IA into northwestern IL this evening. Damaging gusts
(some 70+ mph) are likely.

DISCUSSION...As of 2245 UTC, regional radar imagery shows a stronger
bowing cluster has emerged from the initial convection of storms
over eastern IA. Downstream, a very unstable environment (4000-5000
J/kg of SBCAPE) remains in place. While vertical shear (25-35 kt) is
expected to decrease with southern extent, evidence of an elevated
rear-inflow jet and a 20-25 deg F cold pool, along with the degree
of buoyancy suggest maintenance of this complex is likely for at
least a few more hours. With several gusts to 70+ mph observed over
the 60 minutes, damaging winds remain likely across
eastern/southeastern IA, into northwestern and possible
north-central IL this evening.

CAM guidance has not handled the convective evolution particularity
well thus far, with only a few outlier solutions capturing the
intensity of the bow. This lends lower confidence to the downstream
severe risk this evening. However, the continued favorable
environment and well-organized radar presentation of the system does
suggest at least some damaging wind potential may occur downstream
of the eastern edge of WW590 in IL tonight. Conditions will continue
to be monitored should an additional watch be needed later this
evening.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 591
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
525 PM CDT Fri Aug 15 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Southern Minnesota
  Western Wisconsin

* Effective this Friday afternoon and evening from 525 PM until
  1100 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  Scattered large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Strong to severe thunderstorms will continue to develop
across the region through early evening. Hail will be possible, and
at least isolated damaging wind potential will exist, especially as
storms merge/organize as they progress east-southeastward.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 35
statute miles north and south of a line from 35 miles north of
Redwood Falls MN to 55 miles east southeast of Eau Claire WI. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU1).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 590...

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
1.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 550. Mean storm motion vector
28025.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0458 PM CDT Fri Aug 15 2025

Valid 171200Z - 231200Z

...Day 3/Sunday...
A mid-level trough across the Pacific Northwest along with a diffuse
frontal boundary along a corridor of Pacific moisture will promote a
mix of wet and dry thunderstorms from northern CA into the Northern
Rockies. Alignment of drier, more receptive fuels and faster
northeast thunderstorm motions limiting rainfall are expected across
northern NV into central ID. A 10 percent dry thunderstorm
probability was maintained to cover this threat. A dry southwest
flow pattern between the Pacific Northwest trough and upper-level
ridge across the Southern U.S. will promote sustained
south-southwest winds of up to 15 mph along with low daytime
relative humidity of around 15 percent across southern NV amid very
dry fuels. However, widespread critical fire weather conditions are
not expected.

...Day 4/Monday - Day 8/Friday...
Mid-level troughing will moderate fire weather concerns across the
Northwestern U.S. early next week while the Southern U.S.
mid/upper-level ridge begins to shift and strengthen into the Four
Corners region. Ridging amplifies well into the Northern Rockies by
Day 5/Tuesday with gradual expansion and westward propagation into
the West Coast by Day 8/Friday. Above normal surface temperatures
will similarly expand across most of the western U.S. by the end of
next week. A return of monsoon moisture into the Intermountain West
could pose a dry thunderstorm threat across the eastern Great Basin
beginning on Day 6/Wednesday translating northward to include UT by
Day 7/Thursday and WY by Day 8/Friday. Uncertainty in magnitude of
moisture return and subsequent thunderstorm coverage precludes
introducing dry thunderstorm probabilities at this time.

Mesoscale Discussion 1954
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0349 PM CDT Fri Aug 15 2025

Areas affected...Central High Plains

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 152049Z - 152245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated severe winds and large hail will be possible with
storms that can move off the terrain into the High Plains. A watch
is not expected in the short term.

DISCUSSION...Mid-level ascent is evident on visible/water vapor
imagery this afternoon from the eastern Great Basin into the central
High Plains. Modest moisture (upper 40s/low 50s F) in eastern
Wyoming has allowed convection and widely scattered thunderstorms to
develop. Inhibition immediately to the east of this activity is
slowly weakening. Some this activity will likely move off the
terrain. Isolated severe wind gusts and large hail would be
possible. The observed 18Z UNR/LBF soundings do show stronger
inhibition into the Plains. While there is a signal in guidance for
convection to cluster and eventually intensify, this is not likely
to occur until early evening when MLCIN erodes farther east. At that
point, the low-level jet will focus in the region and mid-level
ascent will be marginally stronger. That said, a watch is not
anticipated in the short term.

0332 PM CDT Fri Aug 15 2025

Areas affected...central/eastern IA and adjacent WI/IL

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 589...590...

Valid 152032Z - 152200Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 589, 590
continues.

SUMMARY...Sporadic severe wind/hail will remain possible through
early evening as a linear cluster moves east-southeast from
north-central Iowa.

DISCUSSION...A short and generally west-southwest/east-northeast
oriented linear cluster has been progressing east-southeast at
around 35-40 kts. The temperature gradient between the cold pool and
the ambient warm-moist sector downstream has increased to 15-20 F.
Strong/near-severe gusts producing localized tree damage along with
marginally severe hail have been recently reported, and should
continue for at least a few more hours, especially on the
eastward-propagating portion of the cluster. Outflow is largely
ahead of the trailing westward portion, but not strongly surging, so
there is possibility for a bowing segment to surge southeastward.
Ongoing Severe Thunderstorm Watches appear to well handle the
overall threat, but some refinement could be needed based on
convective trends over the next 1-2 hours.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 589
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1230 PM CDT Fri Aug 15 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  North-Central Iowa

* Effective this Friday afternoon from 1230 PM until 500 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph likely
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Convective cluster ongoing across northwest IA has shown a
strengthening trend over the last hour or so as it moves into the
moist and destabilizing airmass downstream across north-central IA.
Isolated hail and scattered damaging gusts are possible with this
line as it moves over north-central IA this afternoon.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 60
statute miles north and south of a line from 40 miles west of Fort
Dodge IA to 50 miles south southeast of Mason City IA. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU9).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
1.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector

Valid 152000Z - 161200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THOUGH TONIGHT
FROM THE UPPER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY INTO SOUTH DAKOTA...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong to severe storms with damaging winds and large hail
are likely through tonight from the Upper Mississippi Valley into
South Dakota.

...Upper MS Valley through tonight...
Convection is ongoing in a cluster across north central IA, with
clear evidence of cold pool development and a bowing structure.  The
storms will likely continue to spread eastward/southeastward through
the afternoon while encountering a very unstable environment
characterized by surface temperatures in the upper 80s and
boundary-layer dewpoints in the low-mid 70s.  Cluster is expected to
be maintained given deep-layer shear vectors near 30 kt (oriented
west-northwest to east-southeast), and steep midlevel lapse rates
will support the potential for occasional damaging/severe outflow
gusts and isolated large hail with the strongest embedded updrafts.

Otherwise, a strengthening low-level warm advection regime will
develop tonight into MN along a slow-moving front, and atop the cold
pool from the ongoing IA storms.  Elevated buoyancy will remain
large, with the potential to support additional severe storm
development with occasional large hail and damaging/severe outflow
gusts. 

...NE/SD this evening into tonight...
High-based convection is expected to form this afternoon from
southeast WY into the western NE Panhandle and southwest SD.  The
initial storms will be capable of producing a few severe outflow
gusts in an environment with deep inverted-V profiles and modest
buoyancy.  Though surface convective inhibition will increase this
evening with diurnal cooling, storms could grow into a cluster
through outflow interactions, while moving into richer low-level
moisture and larger buoyancy with eastward extent (along and south
of a baroclinic zone across SD).

..Thompson.. 08/15/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1130 AM CDT Fri Aug 15 2025/

...MN/IA/WI...
Recent satellite imagery shows a pair of convectively generated
vorticity maxima moving across the northern/central Plains, with the
northernmost vorticity max over the eastern ND/SD border and the
southernmost vorticity max over north-central NE. Showers and
thunderstorms have persisted near these features over the last
several hours, but the strongest cells in both of these clusters
have recently shown a weakening trend. A moist and buoyant airmass,
characterized by dewpoints in the upper 60s/low 70s, exists
downstream and redevelopment is possible ahead of both of these
vorticity maxima. How that redevelopment evolves is uncertain, with
recent guidance offering varied solutions regarding overall coverage
and evolution. 

Redevelopment appears most probable with the southern vorticity
maxima, given the ample moist and buoyancy that exists downstream.
This development should grow upscale quickly, with the resulting
convective cluster then tracking southeastward. Recent guidance
continues to trend farther south, so the wind probabilities were
extended southward to cover this potential. Damaging gusts appear
like the most likely threat through the evening. Current progression
of the northern vorticity maximum takes it into a less buoyant
airmass across central MN and northern WI, and redevelopment
along/ahead of this disturbance appears less likely. 

Depending on the strength of the IA cluster, additional development
is possible in its wake amid a strengthening low-level jet and
associated warm-air advection over its outflow. Steep mid-level
lapse rates should still be in place, supporting strong updrafts and
large hail with these elevated storms. 

Lastly, a decaying convective line may reach the southwestern
MN/northwestern IA vicinity late in the period. Given the potential
for preceding storms, the amount of buoyancy that will still be in
place remains is uncertain. However, if thunderstorm coverage is low
or most storms develop farther east, enough buoyancy could remain to
support strong updrafts capable of damaging gusts and/or hail within
the convective line or any preceding more cellular storms.

..NE/SD this afternoon through tonight...
Strong heating and ample mid-level moisture will result in scattered
high-based thunderstorm development across eastern WY and western
NE/SD by late afternoon. Isolated hail and strong gusts are possible
with this initial activity. This activity will then track
east-northeastward through the early evening into a progressively
more moist and unstable air mass across NE and SD. The combination
of improving thermodynamic environment and an intensifying nocturnal
low-level jet will likely aid in thunderstorm intensification and
upscale growth through the evening across northern NE and central
SD. Guidance continues to vary significantly with the strength of
this MCS, but general consensus would suggest the threat for strong
to severe gusts will persist across SD tonight. There is at least a
low probability for the development of a well-organized MCS that
could produce significant severe gusts. However, that probability is
currently too low to introduce an unconditional sig wind area.

...TX Coastal Plain into the Hill Country and Southeast TX...
A maturing tropical disturbance is near south TX, with associated
outflow currently spreading northward across the TX Coastal Plain.
Limited lightning has been noted with in the short-lived cores that
have been developing along this outflow. This process of brief
intensification along this outflow is expected throughout the day,
with an overall increase in thunderstorm coverage anticipated. A
modest increase in low to mid-level flow is expected along the
eastern periphery of this system, spreading northward into central
and southeast TX. Even so, shear will remain weak, with a
disorganized multicellular pulse storm mode anticipated. Given the
very moist profiles (i.e. PW values over 2"), a few water-loaded
downbursts are possible, but should be isolated enough to preclude
the need for severe probabilities.

Valid 171200Z - 181200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM MONTANA
THROUGH THE UPPER MIDWEST AND SOUTHERN GREAT LAKES...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms with potential for isolated severe wind gusts and hail
will be possible on Sunday across parts of the northern Plains
eastward into Upper Midwest and southern Great Lakes.

...Northern Plains/Upper Midwest into the southern Great Lakes...
A flattened mid-level ridge will influence thunderstorm activity on
Sunday across a large part of the CONUS.  On the northern periphery
of the ridge, a weak mid-level disturbance is forecast to crest the
ridge over the north-central states and move from SD to the western
Great Lakes.  Warm 700-mb temperatures and an associated capping
inversion will likely limit storm development across the lower MO
Valley.  A composite surface boundary, likely modulated by previous
day's thunderstorm outflow, is forecast to be draped from the
southern Great Lakes west-northwestward into parts of the Upper
Midwest and into portions of the northern High Plains.  

Showers and storms may be ongoing early Sunday morning across the
Upper Midwest in association with weak low-level warm advection in
advance of the aforementioned impulse.  Isolated to scattered
diurnal storms are forecast to focus along the low-level boundary
during the afternoon/evening given large-scale upper forcing for
ascent will remain weak to negligible.  Despite expected strong
diurnal destabilization, deep-layer shear will likely remain modest
and limit storm organization potential, with isolated severe gusts
and large hail being the severe hazards.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR MUCH OF SOUTH
DAKOTA...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are possible Saturday over South
Dakota primarily during the late afternoon through the late evening
period.  Large hail and severe gusts appear to be the primary
hazards with the stronger storms.

...Northern Great Plains...
A mid-level ridge centered over the lower MS Valley/Mid South will
feature a weak disturbance moving from the WY/CO vicinity into the
Dakotas Saturday night.  A residual composite front will remain
draped east-west from the Upper Midwest into western SD, where it
will intersect a lee trough from the central High Plains
north-northwestward into eastern MT.  Although large-scale ascent
will remain fairly weak across the region, isolated thunderstorms
will likely develop in the vicinity of the lee trough and Black
Hills by the late afternoon as convective inhibition erodes.  To the
north of the front, a moist and unstable airmass featuring a
moderate to very unstable boundary layer will develop by mid-late
afternoon.  Model guidance shows a gradual increase in storm
coverage during the early evening over western/central SD.  Ample
directional shear will support effective shear magnitudes 30-40 kt
and storm organization with the stronger storms.  Large hail and
severe gusts appear to be the primary threats.

...Midwest...
A linear cluster of thunderstorms is expected to be ongoing Saturday
morning across parts of the Upper MS Valley/western Great Lakes. 
Model guidance differs on the evolution of this potentia
shower/thunderstorm activity, but west-northwesterly mid-level flow
poleward of a mid-level anticyclone centered over the lower MS
Valley, will potentially favor some continuation of storms
downstream across the southwestern Great Lakes.  Models continue to
show a moist/unstable airmass across southern portions of the Great
Lakes.  Although large-scale ascent will remain weak across the
region, regenerative storm development on remnant outflow may yield
a subsequent evolution of a storm cluster but uncertainty remains
high.  Isolated damaging gusts/hail are the main threats with these
storms.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1149 AM CDT Fri Aug 15 2025

Valid 151700Z - 161200Z

...Dry Thunderstorms...
Thermodynamic profiles continue to be supportive of dry thunderstorm
development over portions of Northeast NV into southern ID/western
WY and southward along the central UT mountain chain. Enhanced
southwesterly flow associated with a trough over the Great Basin
will support faster storm motions, particularly from a corridor from
northeastern Nevada into southeastern ID, further limiting rainfall
potential. A clearly evident, deeper moisture plume depicted by
satellite imagery currently translating northward from northern AZ
into eastern UT, should promote more wetting rain cores out of
expected higher terrain shower/thunderstorm development this
afternoon. PWATs across the Colorado Plateau and Western Slope
should remain at or above 0.80" limiting lightning ignition
efficiency in this region. Orographically forced convection and a
few thunderstorms with limited rainfall across the Central Sierra
Nevada mountains are also expected over increasingly dry fuels. 

...Southern Nevada, southeastern Idaho and far southwest Montana...
The mid-level trough will also support a swath of enhanced south to
southwest winds (15-20 mph) across southern and eastern NV as well
as portions of central ID mountains and Upper Snake River Plain. The
winds combined with a dry boundary layer and surface relative
humidity of 15% or below will promote elevated fire weather
conditions amid dry fuels.

..Williams.. 08/15/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0159 AM CDT Fri Aug 15 2025/

...Synopsis...
Broad mid-level ridging over the Central US is forecast to build
today, as weak westerly flow passes over it. Weak troughing over the
Great Basin will gradually shift eastward bolstering mid-level flow
over the region. A weak lee low over the High Plains will support
west/southwesterly winds over much of the Great Basin and
Intermountain West through this afternoon. 15-20 mph gusts will
overlap with very warm and dry conditions (RH below 15) from eastern
NV into portions of UT, WY and ID.  Several hours of elevated fire
weather conditions are probable given very dry and receptive fuels.

...Dry Thunder...
Weak height falls from the upper trough over the West will continue
to overspread robust monsoon moisture supporting isolated
thunderstorms this afternoon. Similar to previous days, a
combination of steep mid-level lapse rates and modest mid-level
moisture will overlap with dry boundary layer conditions and high
cloud bases. This will favor dry storms with limited potential for
wetting rainfall. The favorable thermodynamic conditions, coupled
with 15-25 knot storm motions over top receptive fuels will continue
to support dry lightning potential with these storms over the
eastern Great Basin and central Rockies.

Mesoscale Discussion 1950
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0752 AM CDT Fri Aug 15 2025

Areas affected...Parts of northeast NE into extreme northwest IA

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 151252Z - 151415Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...A threat for isolated hail and damaging gusts may continue
into mid morning.

DISCUSSION...A strong cell has recently evolved out of a storm
cluster across northeast NE. This storm appears to be associated
with an MCV that emerged out of the central High Plains. Steep lapse
rates were observed on regional 12Z soundings, and this cell could
continue to pose a threat of hail and localized strong gusts in the
short term as it moves east-northeastward within a favorably
unstable environment (with MUCAPE in excess of 2500 J/kg). 

The longevity of this storm this morning remains uncertain, due to
its evolution into a discrete cell, and a general tendency for
veering and weakening of the low-level jet with time. Recent
HRRR/RRFS guidance suggests that a more organized cluster may
eventually evolve downstream into northern IA in association with
this MCV, though such an evolution may not occur until late morning
or early afternoon, with the aid of diurnal destabilization.

Mesoscale Discussion 1949
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0701 AM CDT Fri Aug 15 2025

Areas affected...Northeast SD into extreme southeast ND/west-central
MN

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 151201Z - 151330Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated severe gusts and hail are possible this morning.

DISCUSSION...A small but relatively long-lived storm cluster has
recently intensified in the vicinity of a surface boundary across
northeast SD, as it has encountered increasingly favorable buoyancy
(with MUCAPE in excess of 3000 J/kg). The longevity of this cluster
is uncertain, due to its elevated nature and some increase in
downstream MUCINH noted in recent mesoanalysis estimates. Midlevel
flow of 25-35 kt will continue to provide somewhat favorable
effective shear for this cluster as long as it persists.

Strong to locally severe gusts have been reported with this cluster
over the last 60-90 minutes, and a threat for isolated damaging wind
may continue in the short term as this cluster approaches far
west-central MN. Hail in excess of 1-inch in diameter has also been
recently observed, and stronger embedded cells could continue to
pose an isolated hail threat, given the presence of steep midlevel
lapse rates and favorable buoyancy.

0240 PM CDT Thu Aug 14 2025

Areas affected...portions of extreme northeast Nevada into central
and northern Utah...southeastern Idaho...and southwestern into
central Wyoming

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 141940Z - 142215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms will pose a risk for strong to potentially
severe wind gusts through the afternoon and early evening hours.

DISCUSSION...High-based thunderstorms are developing atop a dry
boundary layer, where 40-50 T/Td spreads are already in place. RAP
forecast soundings, and the DPG 18Z observed sounding, all depict
inverted-v profiles extending up to 500 mb, with 20-40 kts of
southwesterly flow constrained to the buoyant/cloud-bearing layer.
Given 0-3 km lapse rates already exceeding 9 C/km in spots,
conditions are favorable for fast-moving thunderstorms capable of
producing dry downbursts, with strong erratic wind gusts possible. A
few of these gusts may exceed 50 kts. However, the overall severe
risk should remain widely scattered at best, so a Severe
Thunderstorm Watch issuance is not currently anticipated.

Mesoscale Discussion 1944
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0237 PM CDT Thu Aug 14 2025

Areas affected...southwest to central MN

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 141937Z - 142130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...A marginal severe threat might develop before early
evening within a few cells shifting slowly east from southwest
Minnesota. A Severe Thunderstorm Watch issuance is unlikely.

DISCUSSION...Along the backside of a remnant MCV moving from
south-central to southeast MN, lower-level warm theta-e advection
has persisted across southwest MN. A belt of 40-45 kt
southwesterlies has been consistently sampled by the FSD VWP from
1-3 km and this is expected to gradually shift east into this
evening. RAP-based forecast soundings and observed cloud bases
suggest initial cells are probably rooted around 750 mb along the
differential heating zone west of the MCV cloud shield. Nearly all
guidance has lacked robust convective signal this afternoon, except
for the 12Z HRW-NSSL. It has a low-probability scenario of a
supercell developing within this regime and tracking south-southeast
along the differential heating corridor. The more probable scenario
is for sporadic attempts at transient updraft rotation, capable of
producing marginally severe hail and locally strong gusts. These
threats should remain within a confined corridor at any one time,
but gradually translate east into early evening.

Mesoscale Discussion 1939
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0311 PM CDT Wed Aug 13 2025

Areas affected...portions of northeastern Wyoming into western South
Dakota

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 132011Z - 132145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...The severe threat is increasing across portions of the
northern Plains. Severe wind and hail are the main threats, with an
organized wind threat likely if storms merge into an MCS.

DISCUSSION...A multicellular cluster has developed across northern
WY, and is gradually intensifying (based on increasing lightning
trends) as a mid-level vort max traverses the northern Rockies. As
such, the ongoing convection should persist as it progresses into SD
over the next few hours. With the approach of the vort max,
deep-layer shear should continue to strengthen, with widespread 40
kts of effective bulk shear likely. At the same time, MLCINH will
continue to erode as surface temperatures climb into the 90s F amid
upper 50s F dewpoints in western SD, boosting MLCAPE to 1000 J/kg. 

The combination of this buoyancy and mainly elongated hodographs
will encourage continued multicellular development and perhaps
preceding supercells, accompanied by both a severe wind and hail
threat. With time though, upscale growth into an MCS is possible,
particularly in western SD. This MCS will then approach a more moist
low-level airmass while traversing a surface boundary, with surface
dewpoints well into the 60s F, which will encourage further
strengthening and associated potential for some wind swath
organization. As such, a Severe Thunderstorm Watch will eventually
be needed, with timing of watch issuance remaining the primary
question.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 588
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
245 PM MDT Wed Aug 13 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Northern Nebraska
  Western and Central South Dakota
  Northeast Wyoming

* Effective this Wednesday afternoon and evening from 245 PM
  until 1000 PM MDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm cluster moving out of northeast WY is
expected to continue southeastward over the next several hours. This
cluster has already produced several gusts around 60 mph. The risk
for strong to severe gusts should continue over the next several
hours as the cluster moves southeastward into the more moist and
unstable airmass downstream across western/central South Dakota and
northern Nebraska.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 65
statute miles north and south of a line from 85 miles west of Rapid
City SD to 55 miles north northeast of Oneill NE. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU8).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
1.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
27035.

Post-Tropical Cyclone Henriette Discussion Number  37
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   EP082025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 PM HST Tue Aug 12 2025
 
Henriette has failed to produce any deep convection near the 
low-level center for about 12 hours. Global models show that 
convection is not expected to return over the low-level center in an 
environment of strong vertical wind shear, dry mid-level air, and 
cooling SSTs along the forecast track. With convection not 
anticipated to return, Henriette is now designated as a 
post-tropical cyclone. A recent scatterometer Metop-B pass at 0717 
UTC showed winds around 35-39 kt, mainly in the eastern semi-circle. 
Using this data, and an assumed weakening trend from the previous 
advisory the intensity is set to 40 kt.
 
The cyclone is moving towards the northwest at 325/17 kt. This 
general motion should continue through Wednesday, with a turn to the 
north, then northeast around a large subtropical ridge as the system 
continues to weaken. The cyclone is forecast to open into a trough 
and dissipate by the end of the week.
 
This is the last advisory for this system. For additional
information on the post-tropical cyclone please see High Seas
Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, under AWIPS header
NFDHSFEPI, WMO header FZPN02 KWBC, and on the web at
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFEPI.php

Tropical Storm Henriette Discussion Number  35
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   EP082025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 AM HST Tue Aug 12 2025
 
 
Henriette continues to weaken.  Convection has become fragmented
over the past few hours with some shallow convection to the east of
the center.  A microwave image from 1740 UTC showed the low-level
eyewall open to the west.  Subjective and objective Dvorak estimates
have generally decreased this cycle and a blend of these data
supports an initial intensity of 55 kt for this advisory.
 
Atmospheric and oceanic conditions are becoming increasingly
hostile.  Sea surface temperatures are expected to drop below 26
degrees C within a few hours.  The ongoing moderate wind shear is
forecast to increase and likely force additional nearby dry air into
the storm's circulation.  Global models suggest that Henriette will
lose all deep convection within 24 hours.  The latest official
intensity forecast now shows the storm becoming a post-tropical
cyclone on Wednesday and a remnant low by Wednesday evening, and
this is in line with the latest consensus aids.
 
Henriette is moving northwestward or 315/15 kt. This general motion
should continue for the next day or so as the storm is steered 
between a mid-level ridge to the northeast and an upper-level low to 
the west. Thereafter, the system should be steered more by the 
low-level flow as it weakens and is expected to decelerate and turn 
north-northwestward and northward. Only minor adjustments have been 
made to the latest NHC track forecast.

Mesoscale Discussion 1935
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0244 PM CDT Tue Aug 12 2025

Areas affected...southern/eastern IL...western/northern
IN...southwest Lower MI

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 121944Z - 122145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Sporadic strong gusts of 45-60 mph and generally small
hail to 1 inch in diameter will be possible with a broken band of
thunderstorms slowly progressing from Illinois into parts of Indiana
and Lower Michigan. A Severe Thunderstorm Watch is not expected.

DISCUSSION...Along a band of low-level confluence, thunderstorms
have become increasingly numerous from southeast MO into southwest
Lower MI. With surface temperatures of 86-91 F common ahead of this
activity, to the west/north of separate convective outflow in
central IN, potential for sporadic downbursts exists amid weak
lower-level flow. Area VWP data indicate 0-6 km shear around 20 kts
across IL into IN, to around 25 kts in southwest Lower MI. Speed
change with height is largely concentrated in the mid to upper
portion of the buoyancy profile. This suggests small to marginally
severe hail may accompany the strongest updrafts. Loose multicell
clustering may support a localized, marginal severe wind threat.
Based on latest trends, this could be centered in corridors across
the IL/IN/MI border area with ongoing storms near/south of
Chicagoland and separately to the east-northeast of storms near/east
of St. Louis.

Tropical Storm Henriette Discussion Number  34
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   EP082025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
500 AM HST Tue Aug 12 2025
 
The overall satellite presentation of Henriette has not changed 
much overnight with deep convection over the small inner core of 
the cyclone.  Earlier microwave imagery showed that the eye had 
become less distinct, and the latest subjective and objective 
satellite intensity estimates have begun to decrease.  A blend of 
Dvorak Final-T and CI-numbers from the subjective estimates support 
an initial intensity of 60 kt for this advisory. 

Environmental conditions consisting of SSTs of 26-27 degrees C and 
moderate vertical wind shear suggests that only gradual weakening 
will occur today.  However, the shear is forecast to increase 
significantly overnight and on Wednesday which should result in a 
faster rate of demise.  Simulated satellite imagery from the  
global models show the system decoupling in 24 to 36 hours, and the 
updated forecast calls for Henriette to become post-tropical by 
36 hours, but this could occur a little sooner. The latest NHC 
intensity forecast is near the IVCN multi-model consensus aid, which 
is a little above the HFIP corrected consensus that indicates an 
even faster rate of weakening. 

Henriette is moving northwestward or 315/15 kt, and this general 
motion should continue for another 24 to 36 hours as the system is 
steered between a mid-level ridge to its northeast and an 
upper-level low to the west. As the cyclone weakens and is steered 
more by the low-level low it is expected to decelerate and turn 
north-northwestward and northward. The updated official track 
forecast is essentially an update of the previous advisory and lies 
close to the various consensus aids.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM HST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Henriette was
located near latitude 32.8 North, longitude 161.6 West. Henriette is
moving toward the northwest near 16 mph (26 km/h), and this motion 
is expected to continue through Wednesday. A turn toward the 
north-northwest or northwest at a slower forward speed is expected 
Wednesday night, followed by a northward turn on Thursday. 
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased and are near 70 mph (110 
km/h) with higher gusts.  Some weakening is forecast during the 
next 48 hours, and Henriette is expected to become post-tropical on 
Wednesday, and a remnant low Wednesday night. 
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km)
from the center.

Hurricane Henriette Discussion Number  33
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   EP082025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 PM HST Mon Aug 11 2025
 
Henriette's inner core has deteriorated during the past several
hours.  Microwave overpasses from the Space Operations Command 
(SpOC) WSF-M1 and an ISS TEMPEST-D CubeSat imager revealed a 
collapsed, partial eyewall in the eastern half of the cyclone and 
fragmented curved bands in the southwest and northeast quadrants.  
Subjective intensity estimates from PGTW (17th OWS), PHFO, and SAB, 
a 0710 UTC SATCON analysis of 64 kt and a blend of the UW-CIMSS 
objective intensity techniques yield a lowered initial intensity of 
65 kt.
 
Henriette is moving beneath a region of upper-level convergence
between an upper-tropospheric low to the northwest of the cyclone
and an upper-level anticyclone to the northeast.  This inhibiting
dynamic contribution, along with increasing northerly shear and 
progressively cooler oceanic surface temperatures, should cause 
Henriette to weaken quickly through the remainder of the period.  
The majority of the deterministic models predict that Henriette 
should degenerate into a post-tropical cyclone by early Thursday 
and open up into a trough over the central north Pacific by the 
weekend.  Accordingly, quick weakening is indicated in the NHC 
forecast and resembles the previous one, and is very close to the 
LGEM and just above the HCCA and IVCN consensus intensity models.
 
The initial motion is estimated to be northwestward, or 315/14 kt.
Henriette should continue moving in this general heading during the
next couple of days in the mid-level steering flow provided by a
subtropical ridge to Henriette's northeast and a mid- to 
upper-level low located northwest of the cyclone.  Afterward, a 
weakened, vertically shallow Henriette should turn toward the 
north-northwest then to the north while rounding the western 
periphery of a low- to mid-level high to the east.  The new track 
forecast is essentially an update of the previous advisory and lies 
close to the various consensus aids.

Hurricane Henriette Discussion Number  31
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   EP082025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 AM HST Mon Aug 11 2025

Henriette now has a compact Central Dense Overcast, with a dimple 
noted in visible satellite imagery where a small eye could be 
attempting to form, surrounded by a long spiral band.  Subjective 
and objective satellite intensity estimates are relatively 
unchanged from 6 hours ago, so the initial intensity is still 
assumed to be around 75 kt.

The initial motion is also unchanged--northwestward, or 310/16 kt.  
The track guidance is tightly packed for the next 48-60 hours, with 
Henriette expected to continue moving northwestward between a 
mid-level low northwest of the Hawaiian Islands and a large ridge 
centered off the coast of the Pacific Northwest United States.  
There is more significant spread after 60 hours, related to whether 
or not Henriette gets picked up by a shortwave trough near the 
Aleutian Islands (and turns eastward, as in the GFS) or gets left 
behind and continues northward (as in the ECWMF).  The new NHC 
track forecast is a little east of the previous prediction at the 
end of the forecast, leaning toward the new consensus aids.
 
Some intensification is still possible during the next 12 hours or 
so while there remains some favorable divergence aloft, and the NHC 
intensity forecast reflects that potential.  By 24 hours, 
upper-level convergence, increasing northerly to northwesterly 
shear, and cooling sea surface temperatures are expected to induce 
weakening.  Henriette could lose its organized deep convection, and 
thus become post-tropical, in about 60 hours, with the remnant low 
likely dissipating by day 5 over the far northern Pacific.

is moving toward the northwest near 18 mph (30 km/h), and this 
general motion is expected to continue through Wednesday.  A turn 
toward the north-northwest at a slower forward speed is forecast on 
Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some slight strengthening is possible through tonight.  
Weakening is forecast to begin on Tuesday, with Henriette likely 
becoming a tropical storm by early Wednesday and then becoming 
post-tropical by late Wednesday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles
(110 km).

Mesoscale Discussion 1929
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0328 PM CDT Mon Aug 11 2025

Areas affected...central Oklahoma into northeast Oklahoma

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 112028Z - 112200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated damaging wind gusts are possible this
afternoon/evening.

DISCUSSION...A slow moving cold front is advancing southeast across
Oklahoma. Ahead of this front, temperatures in the low to mid 90s
and dewpoints in the upper 60s to low 70s have yielded 2500 J/kg
MLCAPE amid moderately steep mid-level lapse rates (~8 C/km per 12Z
OUN RAOB). A remnant MCV can be seen in visible satellite imagery
approaching central Oklahoma which will also likely be a focus for
stronger storms this afternoon/evening. Very weak shear (~15 knots
per TLX/INX VWP) will result in mostly unorganized convection,
although a few multicell clusters are possible. Isolated damaging
wind gusts will be possible, but no watch is anticipated.

Post-Tropical Cyclone Ivo Discussion Number  20
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092025
800 AM PDT Mon Aug 11 2025
 
The last bit of convection associated with Ivo dissipated about 15 
hours ago, and it has therefore degenerated into a remnant low.  
Maximum winds are estimated to be 25 kt, and further weakening is 
forecast as the system moves over colder waters.  Ivo is expected 
to open up into a trough--and thus dissipate--in about 36 hours, as 
depicted in global model fields.  Until that time, a low-level 
ridge to the north is expected to steer the remnant low westward at 
about 10 kt, and no major changes were made to the official track 
forecast.

Hurricane Henriette Discussion Number  29
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   EP082025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 PM HST Sun Aug 10 2025
 
The satellite presentation of Henriette had degraded earlier this 
evening, perhaps due to what appeared to be an eye wall replacement 
cycle, while the cyclone was also passing over a tongue of slightly 
cooler sea surface temperatures around 25.5C.  Recent satellite 
images however depict the eye becoming better defined and surrounded 
by cooling cloud tops.  The most recent subjective Dvorak current 
intensity estimates were 4.0/65 kt from PHFO and SAB, and 4.5/77 kt 
from JTWC.  Meanwhile, the objective estimates from UW-CIMSS have 
ranged between 65 and 76 kt during the past several hours.  Taking a 
blend of these estimates, the initial intensity has been held at 70 
kt for this advisory.
 
Henriette is moving toward the northwest, or 315 degrees, at 15 kt. 
This general motion is expected to continue during the next couple 
of days as the cyclone is steered between a mid-level low to the 
northwest of Hawaii and a building mid-level ridge far to the north 
of the cyclone.  A turn toward the north and a decrease in forward 
speed is expected beyond 60 hours as the increasingly shallow system 
is steered by a low to mid-level ridge to the east.  The official 
track forecast is near the middle of the guidance envelope and is 
very close to the previous advisory.
 
Henriette will remain over sufficiently warm water for some 
intensification during the next day or so, however, vertical wind 
shear is forecast to increase considerably by about 36 hours.  As a 
result, the official forecast calls for some strengthening during 
the next 24 hours, followed by slight weakening between 24 and 36 
hours, and more rapid weakening thereafter.  Henriette is expected 
to weaken into a post-tropical low by 72 hours, with dissipation 
expected by 120 hours.  The intensity forecast is mostly unchanged 
and is slightly higher than the intensity guidance in the near term, 
then close to the middle of the intensity guidance envelope beyond 
36 hours.

Tropical Depression Ivo Discussion Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092025
200 AM PDT Mon Aug 11 2025

Ivo has become devoid of deep convection as it moves over 
increasingly cooler waters and into a drier air mass.  The current 
intensity estimate is 30 kt which could be a bit generous based on 
partial scatterometer overpasses.

The motion continues west-northwestward, or around 295/9 kt.  Ivo 
should remain embedded in low-level easterly flow for the next day 
or two.  The track forecast is similar to that from the previous 
advisory and very close to the latest corrected consensus, HCCA, 
solution.

Since the system is expected to traverse even cooler waters during 
the next 36 hours or so, it is unlikely to regenerate significant 
deep convection.  Thus the cyclone will likely become a 
post-tropical remnant low very soon.  The global models depict 
the system opening up into a trough within 48 hours and this is 
reflected in the official forecast.
