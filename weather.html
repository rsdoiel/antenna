Mesoscale Discussion 0448
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0713 PM CDT Mon Apr 15 2024

Areas affected...parts of western/central Kansas into south central
Nebraska

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 160013Z - 160245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Rapid thunderstorm development and intensification appears
probable at some point this evening, most likely by 10 PM-Midnight,
but perhaps an hour or two earlier.  Once storms form, a few
supercells  are likely posing a risk for large hail and tornadoes, a
couple of which could become strong. Trends are closely being
monitored for a watch issuance, which seems likely at some point,
though timing remains a bit unclear.

DISCUSSION...A significant mid-level trough and embedded low are in
the process of overspreading the the southern Rockies, with the
leading edge of stronger mid-level height falls beginning to impact
the high plains from the Texas Panhandle through the Black Hills
vicinity.  As intensifying southwesterly mid-level flow (in excess
of 90 kt around 500 mb) noses across the Texas Panhandle vicinity
through 02-04Z, strengthening mid/upper forcing for ascent likely
will increasingly interact with a retreating dryline across western
Kansas.  

As boundary-layer moisture, characterized by dew points increasing
as high as the lower/mid 60s, advects westward beneath steepening
lapse rates aided by cooling aloft, forecast soundings suggest
mixed-layer CAPE may increase in excess of 2000 J/kg within at least
a narrow corridor.  By mid to late evening, it appears that this
will roughly become focused along an axis from near Dodge City  KS
into areas west of Kearney NE.  

Some increase in high based convective development is already
evident to the west of the dryline across the Texas Panhandle into
western Kansas.  While guidance has generally been suggestive that
more substantive convective development and thunderstorm initiation 
may not commence until closer to the 03-05Z time frame, it is not
certain that this will not occur sooner.  Of primary concern, once
storms initiate, intensification may be rapid and include at least
one or two supercells with potential to produce strong tornadoes, as
boundary-layer moistening and destabilization coincide with
enlarging clockwise-curved hodographs beneath southerly 850 mb flow
strengthening in excess of 50 kt.

Mesoscale Discussion 0447
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0632 PM CDT Mon Apr 15 2024

Areas affected...parts of western Texas into far southwest OK

Concerning...Tornado Watch 110...

Valid 152332Z - 160100Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 110 continues.

SUMMARY...The severe risk continues. Developing storms across West
TX will remain capable of all hazards this evening. Broad cloud
cover may limit the threat farther east until more robust forcing
arrives from the west.

DISCUSSION...As of 2315 UTC, regional radar and satellite imagery
showed storms finally developing near the dryline over
west/southwest TX. Likely driven by diurnal mixing west of a broad
cirrus plume, these storms have struggled to maintain intensity over
the last hour due to remaining MLCINH. Continued heating west of the
cloud band may allow for additional development into the early
evening as more intense forcing for ascent from the west. The
environment remains capped, but moderately unstable with 2000-2500
J/kg of MLCAPE and dewpoints in the mid to upper 60s F. Strong
deep-layer shear would support supercellular organization with any
storms able to be sustained. Given the moderate buoyancy and shear,
large hail would be likely. 

Hi-res guidance suggests more robust development is possible closer
to sunset. Low-level flow is also forecast to increase potentially
increasing the tornado risk with any more sustained supercells that
become established. While uncertain on how much storm
development/coverage will occur in the near-term, the environment
remains favorable for severe weather into this evening.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0344 PM CDT Mon Apr 15 2024

Valid 171200Z - 231200Z

A shortwave trough lifting into the Great Lakes region mid to late
this week will continue to weaken while another shortwave will pivot
through the northern Rockies into the northern Plains by late in the
week. The secondary trough is forecast to intensify across the Great
Lakes into the Northeast during the weekend. Across the southern
tier of the U.S., flow aloft will remain relatively zonal through
the period. At the surface, a weak lee cyclone is expected to
develop in southeast Colorado on Wednesday. As this moves eastward
along with the upper trough to the north, cooler air will filter
into the southern Plains. A secondary surge of cooler air will push
into the northern Gulf during the weekend.

...Southern High Plains...
Elevated to perhaps locally critical conditions appear possible as
the southeastern Colorado low develops on Wednesday afternoon. Winds
of 15-20 mph will overlap very low RH of around 10-15%. Fire weather
concerns will be somewhat localized near the terrain to the
southwest of the surface low.

...Western/Central New Mexico...
As the back door cold front pushes against the southern Rockies late
this week into the weekend, generally dry conditions are expected
across the Southwest. As fuels are continuing to dry within New
Mexico, it is possible some fire weather risk will exist for central
and western parts of the state. This would most likely occur on
Saturday when a low-amplitude trough approaches from the west. Model
and fuel trends will continue to be monitored.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0255 PM CDT Mon Apr 15 2024

Valid 152000Z - 161200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
CENTRAL GREAT PLAINS AND CENTRAL TO EASTERN VIRGINIA AND EASTERN
MARYLAND...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are likely across parts of the Great
Plains, beginning mainly this evening and continuing overnight.
Several tornadoes, large to very large hail, and damaging wind gusts
all appear possible.  Strong tornadoes may occur this evening across
parts of Kansas and Nebraska.  Scattered severe gusts are likely
this afternoon into the evening across portions of Virginia.

...Synopsis...
Few forecast changes are needed based on latest observations and
recent short-range guidance. Northward moisture return continues
amid steady surface pressure falls across northeast CO with
convective initiation anticipated in the coming hours across several
regions within the coming hours (see MCDs 440, 441, and 442 for
additional, region-specific details).

...VA/MD...
The Enhanced risk has been modified slightly to better reflect the
corridor of strong/severe wind potential. Latest visible imagery
shows deepening cumulus along a surface pressure trough with
temperatures warming well into the mid/upper 80s. Low-level lapse
rates have increased up to 9 C/km along/ahead of this boundary, as
well as downstream of ongoing convection. These low-level
thermodynamic conditions will support a damaging wind threat with
the strongest cells in the coming hours.

...KS/NE...
Richer moisture is noted advecting northward across central KS into
south-central NE in the form of a shallow cumulus field. Further
convective deepening within this field is anticipated amid continued
heating/destabilization and increasing ascent with the approach of
the primary synoptic wave. Latest WoFS guidance suggests CI may
begin as early as the 22-00 UTC time frame, which is supported by
these observations.

..Moore.. 04/15/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1130 AM CDT Mon Apr 15 2024/

...Synopsis...
Water-vapor imagery this morning shows a large, closed upper cyclone
over UT with this feature ejecting over the southern/central Plains
tonight.  A strong mid/upper-level jet will overspread much of the
southern/central Plains while a cyclone deepens over the High Plains
today.  Southerly low-level flow will facilitate moisture return
northward concurrent with a warm front advancing northward across
the central Great Plains.  A dryline is forecast to mix eastward
across the southern/central High Plains through peak afternoon
heating, before retreating westward this evening across parts of the
TX/OK Panhandles and western KS.

...Northern/Central Plains (Kansas/Nebraska/South Dakota)...
No appreciable change in thinking from the previous forecast in the
overall severe scenario for later today/tonight.  Capping will
likely inhibit storm initiation over the northern/central Plains
through at least late afternoon.  However, strong southerly
low-level flow will advect increasingly rich moisture northward with
upper 50s to low 60s surface dewpoints by early this evening across
the warm sector.  Prior to storm initiation, 2000-3000 J/kg MLCAPE
is forecast concurrent with strengthening mid/upper-level flow.  

Once convective initiation occurs (early evening), rapid supercell
development is expected as a LLJ intensifies.  Large to very large
hail (around 2-3 inches in diameter) will be a threat with any
supercells that can form along/near the warm front, or southward
along the length of the dryline into western KS.  Enlarged
hodographs during the evening will occur through midnight while some
additional increase in low-level moisture acts to counter increasing
CINH due to cooling surface temperatures.  If a few discrete
supercells can maintain a feed of effective near-surface inflow
parcels, the tornado risk will likely become focused with those
storms.  Given the strength of shear/buoyancy combination, strong
tornadoes appear possible this evening/tonight across portions of
KS/NE.  As additional storms develop, an evolving cluster growing
upscale will potentially yield severe gusts, most likely from
north-central KS into central NE overnight.  

...Southern Plains (Oklahoma/Texas)...
A lower coverage of storms is expected to develop farther south
along the dryline over parts of the southern Great Plains late this
afternoon into tonight.  Ample mid to high-level clouds will tend to
limit daytime heating to some extent along the length of the
dryline.  However, model guidance shows sufficient agreement in
depicting storm development across parts of northwest TX by late
this afternoon.  Supercells appear likely with this activity given
strong (50-60 kt) deep-layer shear and large buoyancy.  Isolated
large to very large hail will probably be the main threat with this
convection as it moves towards north-central TX. But, occasional
severe/damaging winds and perhaps a couple of tornadoes may also
occur through the early evening.  Most guidance indicates any
supercells which develop will weaken with eastward extent as they
encounter increasing MLCIN, and become increasingly displaced from
the better large-scale ascent with the upper trough/low ejecting
over the central Plains.  A highly conditional severe threat remains
apparent across OK late this afternoon and evening, with a favorable
parameter space to support supercells capable of producing all
severe hazards.  But, much of OK may have a relative minimum in
convective activity until late tonight as a Pacific cold front
overtakes the dryline.

...Lower OH Valley into the Mid-Atlantic states...
Morning surface mesoanalysis places a residual frontal zone draped
over central IN/OH with a low-level moisture reservoir (low 60s deg
F surface dewpoints) extending from the confluence of the MS/OH
rivers northeastward into the lower Wabash Valley.  Atop this
moisture, a plume of steep 700-500 mb lapse rates (8.0 to 8.3 deg
C/km) sampled at the Lincoln, IL and Wilmington, OH raob sites, will
overspread the OH Valley eastward into VA today.  The richer
low-level moisture will likely remain west of the Appalachians
across the lower OH Valley where 1500-2500 J/kg MLCAPE is forecast. 
Widely scattered thunderstorms are forecast to develop by mid
afternoon within the moist axis along/south of a stalled front over
the OH Valley.  Effective shear 25-35 kt will support a mix of
supercells and organized line segments capable of hail and wind.  

Farther east, steep lapse rates from the surface to 500 mb are
depicted in forecast soundings by early to mid afternoon (8 deg
C/km).  Although PW will be lower across the Mid-Atlantic region, a
more deeply mixed boundary layer is forecast with strong westerly
mid-level flow (40 kt).  Initial cellular storms will likely develop
over the higher terrain with subsequent development across northern
VA.  A band of storms posing a risk for severe gusts (60-70 mph) and
resultant wind damage is forecast.  Given the lapse rate profile
coupled with ample mid- to high-level flow and a linear mode, have
increased wind probabilities and an upgrade to level 3 categorical
outlook this update.  The overall severe threat should gradually
diminish through late evening with the loss of diurnal heating.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
<<<<<<< HEAD
1131 AM CDT Mon Apr 15 2024

Valid 151700Z - 161200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN HIGH
PLAINS...

Morning observed soundings within the High Plains region showed
shallow moisture along with a shallow temperature inversion. This
should allow surface temperatures to rapidly rise into the afternoon
along with moisture mixing out quite efficiently. Widespread
critical fire weather is expected today. Extremely critical
conditions appear probable at least on a localized basis.

Within the Missouri Valley, morning surface observations already
show ongoing elevated to borderline critical conditions, which is
ahead of even the drier/windier deterministic model solutions. Given
pockets of receptive fuels, particularly with southwestern extent,
several hours of elevated to locally critical conditions are
possible. RH should eventually increase from southwest to northeast
as the warm front lifts northward with time.

..Wendt.. 04/15/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0202 AM CDT Mon Apr 15 2024/

...Synopsis...
An upper low and strong jet streak are forecast to intensify and
eject eastward over the Great Plains today and tonight. A lee low
should rapidly deepen over central High Plains with surface pressure
falls and the strong flow aloft bolstering strong surface winds over
much of the Plains. Hot and dry surface conditions atop drying fuels
will allow for widespread critical and localized extremely critical
fire-weather conditions.

...Southern and central High Plains...
As the main upper low phases with the subtropical jet, 70+ kt
mid-level flow will shift eastward and cross the Rockies late in the
afternoon and evening. The rapidly deepening lee low will force
strong west/southwest flow downslope over the High Plains behind a
dryline forecast to mix near 100 degrees west. Sustained surface
winds of 25-40 mph are possible behind the dryline given the strong
pressure falls and enhanced momentum transfer from increasing flow
aloft. Minimum RH values are also expected to be critically low,
falling to 10-15% over much of the High Plains. Widespread dry and
receptive fuels, combined with strong wind gusts and very dry
surface conditions, will support ubiquitous high-end critical
fire-weather concerns from eastern CO and western KS, into parts of
the Panhandles, and eastern NM/west TX. 

Localized extremely critical conditions also appear possible as
strong winds continue to increase into the late afternoon and
evening hours. The most likely corridors for localized extreme
conditions will exist from southeastern CO into parts of western KS
and the northwestern Panhandles, and across parts of the southwest
TX. Here, the overlap of the strongest flow aloft and single digit
RH is possible for a few hours late in the afternoon. Uncertainty on
the duration of extreme conditions remains too large to introduce
any Extremely Critical areas. Considerable uncertainty also exists
on the positioning of the dryline and the amount of mid and
high-level cloud cover. Will maintain a broader Elevated area to
capture the potential for more brief fire-weather conditions should
the dryline mix farther east.

...Missouri Valley...
Locally elevated fire weather conditions are possible in parts of
northwestern Iowa into southeast South Dakota this afternoon. Dry
air ahead of the warm front and gusty winds will increase prior to
precipitation arriving during the evening/overnight. With these
dry/windy conditions occurring primarily over marginally dry fuels
and over a limited duration, the threat is likely to remain
localized.
=======
1128 AM CDT Sun Oct 13 2024

Valid 131700Z - 141200Z

...17Z Update...
A minor areal extension was made to the Elevated area across OK to
include portions of southern KS. Observational trends in relative
humidity, along with the latest hires guidance, suggest a drop to
near or just below 20 percent will occur by early this afternoon
within this added region. Northerly wind speeds behind a cold front
are also expected to increase to around 15 to 20 mph later today. In
addition, fuels are highly receptive to fire spread across the
Plains. Please see the previous discussion for the Elevated area
across AZ and UT, where the forecast has not been adjusted.

..Barnes.. 10/13/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1224 AM CDT Sun Oct 13 2024/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level shortwave trough will transition to a closed low over
the northern Great Basin, providing some enhancement to the
mid-level flow and stronger southerly surface winds over portions of
northwestern Arizona into southern Utah. Dry/breezy post-frontal
flow in Oklahoma will also support Elevated fire-weather concerns. 

...Northwest Arizona into Utah...
The forecast has trended a little less dry, with relative humidity
values between 15-20% and 15-20 MPH winds. The strongest winds
(approaching 20 MPH sustained) will be confined to northwest
Arizona, where ERC values are on the lower end at the 80th annual
percentile and relative humidity is closer to 20%. Further north in
Utah, fuels vary between the 90th and 95th annual percentiles and
are colocated with <15% relative humidity values, but confidence in
winds exceeding sustained 15 MPH is lower. Given the overall spread
of moisture, wind speeds, and fuel percentiles over the area,
Elevated highlights have been maintained with no introduction of
Critical areas. 

...Oklahoma...
Forecast guidance has come into better agreement for 15-20% relative
humidity and 15 MPH winds during the afternoon as a cold front moves
southward across Oklahoma. Fuels guidance shows ERC values at or
exceeding the 98th annual percentile, supporting both wildfire
ignition and spread.

Day 1 Convective Outlook

0745 AM CDT Mon Apr 15 2024

Valid 151300Z - 161200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE CENTRAL PLAINS...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE SOUTHERN MID-ATLANTIC...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are likely across parts of the Great
Plains, beginning mainly this evening and continuing overnight.
Several tornadoes, large to very large hail, and damaging wind gusts
all appear possible. Strong tornadoes may occur this evening across
parts of Kansas and Nebraska.

...Synopsis...
A large, closed upper cyclone is present over the Great Basin this
morning. This feature will track eastward across the central
Rockies, eventually ejecting over the southern/central Plains
tonight. A strong mid/upper-level jet attendant to this upper
cyclone will overspread much of the southern/central Plains through
this evening. Pronounced large-scale ascent preceding the
upper-level trough/low will encourage additional deepening of a
surface low over the central High Plains though the day. Moisture
will continue streaming northward through the period in tandem with
a warm front and persistent low-level warm/moist advection. This
warm front should be located across NE and perhaps into far southern
SD by late this evening, as the primary surface low consolidates
over the NE Panhandle. A dryline is forecast to mix eastward across
the southern/central High Plains through peak afternoon heating,
before retreating westward this evening across parts of the TX/OK
Panhandles and western KS.

...Northern/Central Plains (Kansas/Nebraska/South Dakota)...
A cap and the late timing of large-scale ascent associated with the
ejecting upper cyclone will likely inhibit convective development
across the northern/central Plains through at least late afternoon.
Still, low-level moisture will gradually increase through the day,
with surface dewpoints of at least upper 50s to low 60s becoming
common by early this evening across the warm sector. Steep mid-level
lapse rates and cooling thermal profiles aloft are expected to
contribute to substantial MLCAPE by the peak of the diurnal heating
cycle, with values likely ranging around 2000-3000 J/kg. With
gradually strengthening mid/upper-level flow anticipated, deep-layer
shear should also become sufficiently strong to support a mix of
supercells and multicells across this region.

Convective initiation should be delayed across much of KS/NE/SD
until around 00Z as a southerly low-level jet rapidly strengthens to
50-60 kt. Very large hail (around 2-3 inches in diameter) will be a
threat with any supercells that can form along/near the warm front,
or southward along the length of the dryline into western KS.
Low-level hodographs are forecast to become enlarged/curved in the
00-06Z time frame tonight, and the threat for tornadoes is likewise
expected to increase with any supercells that can persist and remain
at least semi-discrete. Confidence has increased in a more
concentrated corridor of tornado potential across parts of
western/central KS into central NE, where supercells appear most
likely in very favorable thermodynamic and kinematic parameter
space. Given the forecast strength of the low-level shear, strong
tornadoes appear possible this evening/tonight across this area.
Severe/damaging winds will also be possible as convection attempts
to grow upscale into one or more clusters overnight. Even with
nocturnal cooling, these severe/damaging winds may persist given the
ample reservoir of buoyancy available.

...Southern Plains (Oklahoma/Texas)...
The overall coverage and severity of convection across the southern
Plains is somewhat more uncertain compared to locations farther
north across the central Plains. This uncertainty is largely tied to
the influence of a sub-tropical mid/upper-level jet that will move
over the southern Plains through the period, along with associated
mid/upper-level cloudiness. These clouds may tend to limit daytime
heating to some extent along the length of the dryline. Even so,
attempts at robust convective development will probably occur across
parts of northwest TX by late this afternoon. If this activity can
be sustained, then supercells appear likely given ample (50-60 kt)
deep-layer shear. Isolated large to very large hail will probably be
the main threat with this convection as it moves towards
north-central TX. But, occasional severe/damaging winds and perhaps
a couple of tornadoes may also occur through the early evening. Most
guidance indicates any supercells which develop will weaken with
eastward extent as they encounter increasing MLCIN, and become
increasingly displaced from the better large-scale ascent with the
upper trough/low ejecting over the central Plains. A highly
conditional severe threat remains apparent across OK late this
afternoon and evening, with a favorable parameter space to support
supercells capable of producing all severe hazards. But, much of OK
may have a relative minimum in convective activity until late
tonight as a Pacific cold front overtakes the dryline.

...Mid-Atlantic to the Mid Mississippi Valley...
The glancing influence and modest ascent with an upper trough across
the Northeast and eastern Canada will overspread parts of the
Mid-Atlantic by early afternoon. Weak low-level convergence along a
sagging cold front should be sufficient to support isolated to
scattered thunderstorm development through the afternoon and evening
from parts of the mid MS Valley into the OH Valley, central
Appalachians, and southern Mid-Atlantic. Ahead of the front across
the Mid-Atlantic, generally low 50s surface dewpoints and steepened
mid-level lapse rates will foster around 1000-1500 J/kg of MLCAPE
with moderately enhanced westerly mid/upper-level flow. Deep-layer
shear across this region appears strong enough to support supercells
with an associated threat for large hail. Damaging wind gusts may
also occur with multicell clusters that attempt to form as they
track generally east-southeastward through the evening hours. With
weaker deep-layer shear across the mid MS and OH Valleys, convection
should be somewhat less organized while still posing an isolated
threat for hail/wind. The overall severe threat should gradually
diminish through late evening with the loss of diurnal heating.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON
AND EVENING FROM THE NORTHERN APPALACHIANS INTO PARTS OF THE
TENNESSEE VALLEY....

...SUMMARY...
Strong to locally severe thunderstorms are possible, mainly this
evening, from Pennsylvania southward to the Tennessee Valley.
Isolated wind damage should be the main threat.

...Central/Southern Appalachians into the Tennessee Valley...
Water vapor loop shows a fast-moving and deepening shortwave trough
over WI.  This feature will dig southeastward across the Great Lakes
region through the day, with fast flow aloft extending eastward
across the central Appalachians.  A surface low currently over
northern OH will track eastward across PA along a warm front, while
an associated cold front sweeps southeastward across OH/WV/KY/TN. 
Low-level moisture is quite limited ahead of this system, which will
limit coverage and overall intensity of convection.  However, over
half of morning CAM solutions suggest thunderstorm development along
the front this afternoon and evening, where winds aloft and steep
low-level lapse rates will promote a risk of locally gusty/damaging
winds.  

The MRGL risk area has been extended northeastward into parts of
central/northeast PA, ahead of the surface low and along the warm
front.  CAPE will be very weak in this area, but forecast soundings
and some CAM guidance suggest the potential for 1 or 2 rotating
storms capable of gusty wind or perhaps a brief spin-up around peak
heating.

0746 AM CDT Sun Oct 13 2024

Valid 131300Z - 141200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE CENTRAL/SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS AND TENNESSEE VALLEY...

...SUMMARY...
Strong to locally severe thunderstorms are possible, mainly this
evening, across parts of the central/southern Appalachians and
Tennessee Valley. Isolated wind damage and marginally severe hail
should be the main threats.

...Central/Southern Appalachians into the Tennessee Valley...
Ongoing elevated thunderstorms across northeast OH and western PA
should continue eastward this morning in tandem with an enhanced
west-southwesterly low-level jet. This activity is expected to
outpace low-level moisture return and related destabilization today,
and eventually weaken. But in the short term, small hail remains
possible. Meanwhile, a vigorous shortwave trough over the Upper
Midwest will dig southeastward through the base of a large-scale
mid/upper trough, and yield amplification of this trough southward
across the Great Lakes through Monday morning. Ascent preceding this
shortwave trough will overspread parts of the central/southern
Appalachians into the TN Valley, mainly during the evening and
overnight.

A leading and weaker mid-level perturbation will encourage the
primary surface low to develop eastward across PA this afternoon
through early evening. A surface cold front will extend southwest of
this low into the TN Valley. Convective development along the front
appears likely to be delayed until early evening, as the
strengthening large-scale ascent aids in increasing low-level
convergence along the front amid generally veered flow within the
warm sector. Surface dew points should largely range from the mid
50s in WV to a narrow corridor of low 60s in TN, yielding a plume of
MLCAPE around 500-1500 J/kg amid initially steep mid-level lapse
rates.

Recent guidance still differs regarding storm coverage along/ahead
of the cold front this evening, from almost none to scattered. This
is perhaps in response to the ascent with the shortwave trough
strengthening after peak diurnal heating. The strongest 700 mb
westerlies (around 40-55 kt) should be confined to mainly northeast
of the TN Valley. Forecast hodographs above this level appear small,
owing to weakening winds with height as fast mid/upper flow lags to
the north-northwest. This suggests supercell structures may struggle
to develop/be sustained. But the strong 700 mb flow could support
localized damaging winds in any multicell clusters that can form.
Farther southwest, somewhat greater buoyancy could foster small to
marginally severe hail as well. The overall severe threat appears
likely to remain rather isolated, and no changes have been made to
the Marginal Risk with this update.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0200 PM CDT Sat Oct 12 2024

Valid 141200Z - 151200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
The risk for thunderstorms still appears negligible across much of
the U.S. Monday through Monday night.

...Synopsis...
A broad mid-level trough, with embedded perturbations, will persist
across the eastern CONUS as a 500 mb cut-off low continues to
meander over the Four Corners region. Widespread surface high
pressure behind a cold front will overspread the MS Valley toward
the Gulf Coast and Atlantic Seaboard, resulting in enough static
stability to limit thunderstorm development over most locales. The
cold front should be drifting southward across the FL Peninsula,
with thunderstorms possible across southern portions of the state by
afternoon. A couple of lightning flashes are also possible over
portions of Lake Michigan and Lake Erie (and immediate surrounding
landmass), as cold mid-level temperatures associated with the upper
trough overspread relatively warm waters. Finally, cooler mid-level
temperatures and associated lapse rates accompanying the cut-off low
may support a couple of thunderstorms over the higher terrain of the
Four Corners given the assistance of orographic lift.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1258 AM CDT Sat Oct 12 2024/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level shortwave trough will transition to a closed low over
the northern Great Basin on Sunday, providing some enhancement to
the mid-level flow and stronger southerly winds over portions of
northwestern Arizona into southern Utah. Dry/breezy pre-frontal flow
in Texas and post-frontal flow in Oklahoma may result in Elevated
fire-weather conditions as well. 

...Northwest Arizona into Utah...
15-20 MPH winds and 10-15% relative humidity values are expected as
daytime heating and boundary-layer mixing occurs during the
afternoon, with some areas seeing locally critical conditions where
topography supports enhanced surface winds. These conditions will
overspread fuels modestly to very receptive to wildfire ignition and
spread, with ERC values between the 80th and 95th annual
percentiles.

...Central Texas...
Portions of central Texas may see Elevated fire-weather conditions
on Sunday, where warm/dry southwesterly flow ahead of a
southward-moving cold front will support at least 15 MPH winds with
boundary-layer relative humidity values between 10% and 20%.
However, these conditions don't currently overlap with especially
receptive fuels, and there is still uncertainty in the surface wind
speeds reaching sustained Elevated criteria. 

...Oklahoma...
Much of Oklahoma could also experience some Elevated fire-weather
conditions in a dry and breezy post-frontal airmass. However,
ensemble guidance indicates spread/uncertainty in both
boundary-layer relative humidity and wind speeds supporting wildfire
spread, and recent wetting rainfall has lessened fuel receptiveness
in portions of Central Oklahoma. Still, much of the fuels
surrounding the areas recently rained on have ERC values exceeding
the 95th annual percentile. If future forecast guidance comes into
better agreement about the meteorological conditions, Elevated
highlights may be warranted.

Valid 131200Z - 141200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR PORTIONS OF
THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS...

...SUMMARY...
Strong thunderstorms cannot be ruled out in a corridor across West
Virginia, and perhaps into portions of eastern Kentucky and
southwestern Virginia, late tomorrow (Sunday) afternoon and evening.
Small to marginally severe hail and potentially damaging wind gusts
are the main concerns.

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will amplify across the eastern half of the CONUS
as a 500 mb cut-off low meanders over the Interior West and a second
upper trough impinges on the West Coast tomorrow (Sunday). A surface
low will translate across the eastern OH Valley and Mid Atlantic
states during the day, promoting deep-layer ascent amid just enough
moisture return to support thunderstorm development (a couple of
which may be strong). Meanwhile, steep lapse rates associated with
the 500 mb low over the Four Corners, in conjunction with adequate
surface heating and orographic lift, may support isolated
thunderstorm development. Daytime heating of a moist airmass may
also encourage the development of a few thunderstorms over the
southern FL Peninsula.

...Central Appalachians...
As the surface low progresses toward the Mid Atlantic, a cold front
will sag southeastward across the eastern OH Valley into the central
Appalachians by afternoon peak heating, providing lift for at least
isolated thunderstorm development. Surface dewpoints are expected to
only reach the mid 50s F. However, 7+ C/km low and mid-level lapse
rates may support over 1000 J/kg SBCAPE, that combined with rapidly
strengthening vertical wind profiles and 35+ kts of effective bulk
shear, may support organized multicells immediately ahead of the
cold front. A couple of damaging gusts or instances of small to
marginally severe hail cannot be ruled out with the stronger storms.
