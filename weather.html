Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0756 AM CDT Thu Mar 27 2025

Valid 271300Z - 281200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE LOWER
MISSOURI/MID-MISSISSIPPI VALLEY REGION...AND SOUTH TEXAS...

...SUMMARY...
Multiple rounds of severe thunderstorms are possible in south Texas.
Across parts of the Lower Missouri/Mid-Mississippi Valleys, isolated
to scattered large hail and localized severe wind gusts are
possible, mainly during the late afternoon and evening.

...South Texas...
The slow-moving upper trough will eject across northern Mexico
toward deep South Texas by the end of the period. Strongest
mid-level flow will translate through the base of the trough, south
of the international border into the lower Valley of Texas by early
evening. A low-level jet will remain focused across south Texas and
multiple rounds of deep convection are expected. While regenerative
convection and outflow will limit the northern extent of more
appreciable destabilization, adequate buoyancy, a modestly steep
lapse rate environment, and deep-layer shear will support robust
updrafts and storm organization. Hail/wind appear to be the main
threats, although a tornado or two can not be ruled out.

...Central Plains to Lower Missouri/Middle Mississippi Valleys...
Scattered thunderstorms, including a few lingering strong storms,
continue early this morning mainly across northwest Missouri and far
southern Iowa. These storms will continue to transition
east-southeastward, with severe-storm potential remaining limited as
the low-level jet/warm advection abate this morning. 

As the regional upper ridge tends to flatten later today into
tonight, steep mid-level lapse rates will overspread this region.
Convective inhibition may become sufficiently weak by late
afternoon/early for isolated thunderstorm development near the warm
front/wind shift including a corridor across northern Kansas,
southeast Nebraska to southwest Iowa/northwest Missouri.
Supercellular development could occur in the presence of moderate
instability and favorable wind profiles featuring around 35-40 kt
effective shear magnitudes. A greater coverage of elevated storms
will occur tonight as the low-level jet reestablishes and storms
expand eastward regionally. Large hail is the most probable hazard
in both regimes.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0357 AM CDT Thu Mar 27 2025

Valid 301200Z - 041200Z

...DISCUSSION...
Predictability remains a concern during the medium-range period. 
Models reveal notable differences even in the Day 4-5 time frame
with respect to strength of the eastern U.S. upper trough, and
associated evolution/development of the surface pattern.  As the
initial surface system moves offshore late in the Day 5 period
(Tuesday morning), substantial divergence in solutions is evident
with the next trough moving into/across the western CONUS.  Given
these differences, any severe potential beyond Day 5 cannot be
quantified with any degree of confidence.

With that said, a fairly widespread area of severe potential remains
evident Day 4/Sunday, ahead of a cold front moving eastward across
the Mississippi and Ohio and eventually the Tennessee Valleys. 
Northward advection of 60s dewpoints is expected ahead of this
front, which will combine with daytime heating to boost mixed-layer
CAPE into the 1000 to 1500 J/kg range, and potentially above 2000
J/kg farther southwestward along the front from East Texas into the
lower Mississippi Valley.

As a belt of strong southwesterly flow aloft overspreads the
moistening/destabilizing pre-frontal boundary layer, development of
strong/severe storms is expected near and ahead of the boundary
during the afternoon -- potentially extending as far southwestward
as East Texas.  Along with potential for large hail and damaging
winds, likelihood for supercell storms suggests potential for a few
tornadoes as well.  Risk will spread eastward through the evening
across portions of the Midwest/Ohio Valley and Mid/Lower Mississippi
Valley, and southeastward into the Tennessee Valley and central Gulf
Coast states overnight -- likely persisting through the end of the
period.

Day 5/Monday, models begin to differ more substantially with respect
to surface frontal location -- particularly with northern extent. 
The GFS depicts the front as extending from New England
southwestward to the Texas Coast Monday morning, while the ECMWF
places it from Lower Michigan to coastal Texas.  By late afternoon,
the GFS shows the front reaching the New England coastal area and
Mid-Atlantic region, focusing the primary severe threat from the
Mid-Atlantic area southwestward.  Meanwhile, some risk could extend
as far north as the Lower Great Lakes region/central Appalachians
per the ECMWF's deterministic forecast.  At this time, will keep the
Day 5 risk area focused from the Mid-Atlantic region to the lower
Mississippi Valley, though adjustments/refinements to the area over
the next several days will likely be required.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0215 AM CDT Tue Mar 25 2025

Valid 261200Z - 271200Z

...Synopsis...
Large-scale ridging will continue to amplify over the western US as
a subtle southern stream shortwave trough slides underneath the
ridge. Weak ascent will overspread parts of the Southwest as modest
moisture returns to the west. This may support isolated dry
thunderstorms atop dry fuels in parts of the Southwest.

...Parts of NM...
As the weak upper-level trough moves over the Southwest, modest
ascent and easterly upslope flow is expected to promote isolated to
widely scattered showers and thunderstorms from central NM to
western TX. At the western extent of the moist plume, PWAT values
less than 0.75 inches will overlap with sufficiently steep low and
mid-level lapse rates to support high-based storms with poor
precipitation efficiency. Dry lightning strikes appear likely over
very receptive fuels given the high-based nature of any convection
that forms. An Isolated Dry Thunder area has been added across
western and central NM where best overlap of thunderstorm potential
and dry fuels should exist for several hours Wed.

...Appalachians...
Another day of dry conditions is expected across the southern
Appalachians Wed. High pressure will gradually shift eastward with
downslope flow likely across parts of western VA and the Carolinas.
While surface winds may not be overly strong (generally less than 15
mph), isolated gusts near 20 mph are possible. In addition,
afternoon RH should fall below 25%. Model guidance shows
considerable spread regarding the spatial and temporal coverage of
any elevated fire weather conditions that may develop. A few hours
of locally elevated fire-weather conditions are possible, but
uncertain.

Mesoscale Discussion 0260
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0756 AM CDT Mon Mar 24 2025

Areas affected...southeastern Louisiana

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 64...

Valid 241256Z - 241430Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 64
continues.

SUMMARY...A damaging wind threat will continue through the morning
across southeast Louisiana.

DISCUSSION...A line of storms continues to move east across
southeast Louisiana this morning with a recent 68 knot wind gust at
KBTR at 1228 UTC near the apex of this bow. The 12Z LIX RAOB showed
around 1250 J/kg MLCAPE with a weak near-surface stable layer and 48
knots of 0-6 km shear. Extensive cloudcover should limit much
heating this morning, but continued low-level moistening ahead of
the squall line should maintain some surface based instability and a
damaging wind threat through the morning. The northern extent of
this severe weather threat is likely delineated by a southward
moving line of storms/outflow boundary (currently near the MS/LA
border). An additional watch is not currently anticipated east of
watch 64 as any residual surface based instability will likely be
limited to the immediate coastline by later this morning.
