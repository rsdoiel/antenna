Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1100 AM CST Wed Dec 20 2023

Valid 211200Z - 221200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated thunderstorms should occur Thursday across parts of
central/southern California and southern Arizona. Severe
thunderstorms are not expected.

...Synopsis and Discussion...
An upper low should be centered well off the coast of southern CA
early Thursday morning. This low is expected to drift gradually
southward through the day, before moving more eastward towards the
coast overnight and into Friday morning. Large-scale ascent, ample
mid-level moisture, and cold mid-level temperatures associated with
this upper low should encourage isolated thunderstorms along and
near the central/southern CA coast through the period. As the low
moves gradually eastward, showers and occasional thunderstorms are
forecast to expand eastward across southern Arizona through early
Friday morning. Weak instability should preclude a meaningful threat
for severe thunderstorms across these areas.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1025 AM CST Wed Dec 20 2023

Valid 201630Z - 211200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated thunderstorms will be possible across parts of
southern/central California and over portions of the Southwest.
Severe weather is not expected.

...Discussion...
Low-amplitude ridging aloft will prevail across much of the country
today, as eastern U.S. troughing continues to slowly depart the
Northeast.  The main feature of interest with respect to convective
potential remains an upper low off the coast of California, which
will continue moving slowly southward.

Within the warm conveyor region of this system, and just ahead of a
weak surface front moving onshore, a disorganized band of convection
is indicated -- the strongest portion of which will gradually move
onshore over San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara Counties over the
next few hours.  Ahead of this band, onshore instability remains
very weak and low-topped -- as evidenced by the overall lack of
lightning.  This, combined with weak low-level shear precludes any
appreciable risk for severe weather, though gusty winds may
accompany any stronger convective elements.

Elsewhere, sporadic lightning will continue across portions of the 
Southwest, in conjunction with a weaker mid-level disturbance moving
slowly eastward across the Four Corners states.  Thunderstorms are
not expected across the remainder of the U.S., where surface high
pressure and accompanying cool/stable conditions prevail.

No changes, the potential for critical fire-weather conditions is
low.

..Lyons.. 12/20/2023

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1249 AM CST Wed Dec 20 2023/

...Synopsis...
Upper-ridging will overspread the central and eastern U.S. as a
mid-level trough meanders along the California coast today. Surface
high pressure will reinforce cooler temperatures from the
Mississippi River to the Atlantic coastline, as well as over the
Intermountain West. Meanwhile, surface lee troughing will encourage
modest moisture return across the Plains states, with the West Coast
mid-level trough supporting appreciable precipitation accumulations
over much of California. The culmination of the aforementioned
synoptic setup will be quiescent fire-weather conditions over the
CONUS.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0631 AM CST Wed Dec 20 2023

Valid 201300Z - 211200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated thunderstorms will be possible across parts of
southern/central California and over portions of the Southwest. The
severe-thunderstorm threat appears low.

...CA to AZ/NM though tonight...
A midlevel low is expected to move slowly southward off the
central/southern CA coast through early Thursday, while a weak/lead
shortwave trough ejects northeastward over AZ/NM.  Some midlevel
convection occurred overnight across southern AZ in association with
the lead wave, where sufficient midlevel lapse rates/moisture
contributed to MUCAPE of 100-200 J/kg (rooted near 700 mb). 
Isolated thunderstorms will be possible through the day from
southeast AZ shifting eastward into NM.  Otherwise, the primary
baroclinic band will overspread the central CA coast today and
eventually reach the southern CA coast by tonight.  Isolated
thunderstorms will be possible near the coast through the period,
and across the San Joaquin Valley this afternoon.  Forecast wind
profiles suggest low potential for embedded organized/weakly
rotating storms just offshore, as observed south of San Francisco
this morning.  However, inland buoyancy should remain too marginal
to introduce any damaging wind and/or tornado probabilities.

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will meander along the West Coast as upper
ridging persists from the Interior West toward the Appalachians
tomorrow/Tuesday. While surface lee troughing is expected across the
High Plains, surface high pressure and associated cooler air should
dominate over the rest of the CONUS. Similar to Day 1, quiescent
fire weather conditions are expected over the U.S.

Mesoscale Discussion 2333
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1106 AM CST Sun Dec 17 2023

Areas affected...parts of the coastal Carolinas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 171706Z - 172100Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...A conditional risk of brief tornadoes or damaging gusts is
forecast today, from the South Carolina upper coast toward coastal
North Carolina. The risk is conditional on air mass recovery, and a
watch may be considered.

DISCUSSION...A surface low will deepen as it moves northeastward off
the SC Coast today, along an existing baroclinic zone which is
currently well offshore. Surface observations show cool air over
land with gusty northeast winds, and this will likely maintain a
decoupled boundary layer which should mitigate tornado and damaging
gust potential in the near term.

Later today, gradual warming is expected as the warm front shifts
north along the coast. As winds veer to east and then southeast, a
warmer and more unstable air mass will then support a risk of brief
tornadoes and damaging gusts, as shear will remain strong along the
warm front. Observational trends will continue to be monitored
closely, along with satellite imagery, to ascertain when a potential
watch may be needed later today.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 722
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
150 PM EST Sun Dec 17 2023

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  eastern North Carolina
  Coastal Waters

* Effective this Sunday afternoon and evening from 150 PM until
  800 PM EST.

* Primary threats include...
  A few tornadoes and a couple intense tornadoes possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 65 mph possible

SUMMARY...Potential for locally damaging winds and a couple of
tornadoes will gradually increase this afternoon and into this
evening, as locally intense thunderstorms shift north-northeastward
across the North Carolina Coastal Plain and Outer Banks area.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 45 statute miles
east and west of a line from 110 miles northeast of New Bern NC to
30 miles south of Wilmington NC. For a complete depiction of the
watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU2).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 0.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 55 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 400. Mean
storm motion vector 18040.
