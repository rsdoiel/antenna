Mesoscale Discussion 0070
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0121 PM CST Thu Feb 06 2025

Areas affected...Portions of western/central Tennessee and vicinity

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 061921Z - 062145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms are expected to increase in coverage and
intensity across Tennessee this afternoon and evening along and
ahead of a cold front.  Convective trends will continue to be
monitored for the possibility of a watch.

DISCUSSION...While synoptic forcing is limited across the area, some
vertical ascent is apparent in visible imagery across southeastern
Missouri, leading to multiple instances of convective initiation. 
Deep-layer shear (around 50 knots per mesoanalysis) is sufficient to
support organized storm modes, including supercells.  Long, straight
hodographs will also be supportive of storm splits, as evidenced by
the initial storm evolution in northwestern Tennessee.  The limiting
factor to a more robust severe threat is the marginal instability
(currently around 500 J/kg of MLCAPE).  Low-level clouds have been
persistent across much of western/central Tennessee slowing
destabilization across the area.  Nevertheless, with some additional
clearing/heating, storms are expected to increase in coverage and
intensity, especially over northern-middle Tennessee later this
afternoon and evening, posing an all-hazards severe weather risk.
Convective trends will be monitored for the possibility of a watch.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0253 PM CST Thu Feb 06 2025

Valid 081200Z - 141200Z

Generally zonal mid-level flow will prevail across much of the
central and southern CONUS through Day 5 (Monday), before more
pronounced upper troughs traverse the Rockies by Days 6-8 (next
Tuesday-Thursday). Over the weekend, a surface low will drift away
from the southern Plains, with some lee surface troughing and
associated downslope flow expected across portions of the southern
High Plains. Surface high pressure and an intruding cold front will
also overspread much of the Plains states toward the Lower
Mississippi Valley and points east this weekend into mid next week. 

For Days 5-6 (next Monday-Tuesday) downslope flow will promote dry
and windy conditions across southern New Mexico into Far West Texas.
Thereafter, a cold front will sweep across the southern Plains, with
dry and windy conditions persisting across Far West Texas on Day 7
(Wednesday). Given medium-range guidance consensus in widespread dry
and windy conditions meeting Elevated- to Critical-equivalent
criteria, and given the lack of recent observed or forecast
precipitation accumulations, 40 percent Critical probabilities have
been introduced.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PORTIONS OF
TENNESSEE AND VICINITY...

...SUMMARY...
A few strong/severe thunderstorms are expected this afternoon and
evening across parts of the Tennessee Valley.

...20z Updates...
Updates were made to clip the Marginal Risk to the Blue Ridge
Mountains in the western Carolinas to account for where instability
wanes and more stable air resides. A few thunderstorms have
developed across northwestern Tennessee into southwestern Kentucky.
Additional thunderstorm development is expected into Middle
Tennessee/central Kentucky through the afternoon and evening. See
MCD#70 for more information on this threat.

..Thornton/Hart.. 02/06/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1008 AM CST Thu Feb 06 2025/

...TN and vicinity...
Morning visible satellite imagery shows a surface cold front
extending from northwest TN into southern KY.  The air mass along
and south of the front continues to slowly moisten with dewpoints
now in the 60s across most of western/middle TN, and cloud cover
appears to be thinning.  This will lead to a zone of 1000-1500 J/kg
surface-based CAPE this afternoon.  Most 12z model solutions
indicate scattered thunderstorms will form along the front and track
east-southeastward across much of TN through the afternoon/evening. 
Low-level wind fields are considerably weaker than last night,
suggesting the overall tornado risk has likely decreased.  However,
mid-level lapse rates around 7 C/km, weak forcing, strong westerly
flow aloft, and diurnal heating suggest the risk of a few discrete
rotating/bowing storms capable of hail and damaging wind gusts.  A
tornado or two is possible.  The threat may persist after dark in
east TN, but should weaken as storms move into less instability over
the mountains.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF CENTRAL NEW MEXICO
INTO THE WESTERN TEXAS PANHANDLE...

Widespread dry and windy conditions are still anticipated during the
day tomorrow (Friday) for far eastern Arizona into much of New
Mexico and far western Texas. Elevated and Critical highlights have
been expanded to areas where the latest guidance consensus has
trended drier and windier. Critical conditions (25+ mph sustained
westerly winds amid 10 percent RH) are expected to be widespread
along the lee of the Sangre de Cristo mountains into the western TX
Panhandle. However, at least brief bouts of Critical conditions may
be expected along the lee of Sacramento and Guadalupe mountains in
southern New Mexico, as well as parts of western New Mexico, by
afternoon peak heating.

..Squitieri.. 02/06/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0156 AM CST Thu Feb 06 2025/

...Synopsis...
Westerly mid-level flow will continue over the CONUS D2/Friday as a
more prominent shortwave and attendant jet streak approach the
Southwest. In response to the approach of the upper trough, a lee
cyclone will intensify over the High Plains, supporting strong winds
and low humidity. The persistent dry conditions, exacerbated by
downslope winds and low humidity, will support widespread elevated
to critical fire-weather conditions.

...Southwest and Southern High Plains...
Another day of dry and windy conditions is expected across parts of
the Southwest and High Plains D2/Friday. As the mid-level jet and
shortwave cross the Rockies, enhanced lee cyclogensis will support
strong west/southwesterly winds of 20-30 mph across eastern AZ, much
of NM and parts of western TX/OK. Continued warm temperatures and
dry downslope trajectories will support afternoon RH values in the
teens to single digits. The combination of strong westerly winds,
low humidity and worsening fuels suggest widespread elevated to
critical fire-weather conditions are likely. The most likely area
for sustained critical concerns is expected across parts of the High
Plains in northeastern NM and the TX Panhandle.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0121 PM CST Thu Feb 06 2025

Valid 081200Z - 091200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Aside from low probabilities for scattered thunderstorm development
across parts of the Ohio Valley, the risk for thunderstorms appears
negligible across much of the U.S., Saturday through Saturday night.

...Discussion...
Models indicate that mid-level flow will begin to undergo
amplification across the northern mid-latitudes of the eastern
Pacific into western North America, including building mid-level
ridging across the northeastern Pacific through Alaska and digging
downstream troughing east of the Canadian Rockies.  Otherwise, it
appears that there will be little change across much of the
contiguous U.S., with ridging centered over the subtropical
latitudes maintaining an influence across much of the southern into
central tier states.  Within a broadly confluent, zonal regime
across the northern tier, a couple of embedded short wave
perturbations may consolidate into larger-scale, but still
low-amplitude, troughing progressing across the Great Lakes vicinity
into Northeast by late Saturday night.

It appears that the evolving mid-level trough may provide support
for increasingly significant surface cyclogenesis offshore of the
northern Mid Atlantic coast by the end of the period.  This is
likely to be focused along a tightening baroclinic zone, near the
eroding southern periphery of a seasonably cold air mass entrenched
to the east of the Rockies.  Initially stalled across parts of the
southern Great Plains into Ohio Valley and southern Mid Atlantic,
the surface frontal zone is forecast to advance southward into the
Gulf Coast states Saturday through Saturday night, in the wake of
the wave.

...Lower Ohio Valley...
Model differences concerning the frontal wave development, and
potential boundary-layer destabilization, along the eroding shallow
southern periphery of the cold air across the interior U.S. remains
problematic concerning convective potential.  Strengthening of
lower/mid-tropospheric wind fields and shear near the frontal wave
is likely to become conditionally supportive of severe weather
potential, given sufficient destabilization.  However, regardless of
the boundary-layer modification (and the NAM may be too aggressive
with the lingering shallow sharp surface-based inversion across
Kentucky, east-northeast of Bowling Green into the Blue Grass by
late Saturday afternoon), there does appear a general consensus that
relatively warm, dry air at mid-levels may tend to suppress
destabilization.  At least some convection, perhaps mostly elevated
near and north of the Ohio River, may become capable of producing
lightning.  But the risk for severe weather still appears negligible
at this time.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1105 AM CST Thu Feb 06 2025

Valid 071200Z - 081200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Aside from some potential for a couple of weak thunderstorms across
parts of the northern Rockies vicinity, the risk for thunderstorms
appears negligible across much of the U.S., Friday through Friday
night.

...Discussion...
Models indicate that broad mid/upper ridging will be maintained
across the subtropical latitudes, from northern Mexico through the
western Atlantic, and a prominent influence across the southern into
central tier of the U.S. through this period, downstream of
persistent ridging in the northern mid-latitudes, and troughing in
the southern mid- to subtropic latitudes, of the eastern Pacific. 
To the east of the northeastern Pacific ridging, broad mean
troughing, with more progressive embedded smaller-scale
perturbations, is forecast to linger across British Columbia and 
the Pacific Northwest, while developing eastward across the Canadian
Prairies, northern U.S. Rockies and Great Plains.  

Beneath this regime, guidance indicates potential for modest surface
cyclogenesis across eastern Colorado through areas near/south of the
Kansas/Oklahoma border vicinity.  There appears better consensus
among the models, particularly the ECENS/ECMWF and GEFS/GFS.  But
this output may still be having issues handling ongoing reinforcing
cold intrusions to the lee of Rockies.  The NAM and Rapid Refresh
remain slower to erode the colder boundary-layer across the Texas
South Plains into central Oklahoma vicinity, and are slower and
weaker with the evolving surface wave. 

Otherwise, a gradual erosion, from south to north, of the shallow
leading edge of the entrenched cold air mass is possible, beneath a
continuing southerly to westerly return flow across parts of the
southeastern Great Plains into southern Mid Atlantic.  However, it
appears that associated moisture emanating from a modifying western
Gulf boundary layer will not become supportive of more than weak
destabilization, or an appreciable risk for thunderstorms, due to
negligible forcing for ascent and warm, capping layers aloft.

...Pacific Northwest into northern Great Plains...
Models do indicate that forcing for ascent and cooling mid-levels
may contribute to pockets of weak destabilization across parts of
the Pacific Northwest into northern Great Plains during this period.
However, based on the latest NAM and Rapid Refresh forecast
soundings, the calibrated High Resolution Ensemble Forecast guidance
might be too aggressive with probabilities for thunderstorms across
the eastern Great Basin into northern Rockies vicinity for Friday
afternoon and evening.  Instability will probably be sufficient to
support scattered to numerous snow and rain showers.  However,
whether the boundary layer in higher elevations warms enough, or
convection initiating in lower elevations deepens through
sufficiently cold layers aloft, to support an appreciable risk for
lightning remains a bit unclear.

made to the forecast to reflect the latest high-resolution guidance
consensus.

..Squitieri.. 02/06/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0154 AM CST Thu Feb 06 2025/

...Synopsis...
Zonal, mid-level flow is forecast to continue across the central and
western US today and tonight. Embedded within the westerly flow,
several weak perturbations will cross the Rockies enhancing a lee
trough over the High Plains. 

...Southwest and Southern High Plains...
Dry and breezy conditions are again expected across parts of eastern
AZ and NM today as strong westerly flow continues over the Rockies.
Several embedded mid-level perturbations will help strengthen lee
troughing, and the resulting west/southwesterly surface winds to
15-25 mph. The strong downslope winds, along with warm temperatures
and days of low humidity will support afternoon RH values of 10-15%.
 Given the favorable overlap of strong winds, low humidity and
ongoing drought, widespread elevated fire-weather conditions are
likely. A few hours of locally critical fire-weather conditions also
appear possible within areas of stronger terrain-enhanced wind
gusts. However, confidence in widespread critical conditions is
relatively low.

Areas affected...Southeast KY into far western VA

Concerning...Tornado Watch 3...

Valid 061452Z - 061615Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 3 continues.

SUMMARY...Some threat for locally damaging wind and/or a tornado may
continue into late morning.

DISCUSSION...A band of thunderstorms with a history of producing an
apparent tornado and locally damaging gusts is moving across
southeast KY toward western VA this morning. Diminishing instability
with eastward extent and a tendency for a weakening/veering
low-level jet (as the primary midlevel shortwave trough moves away)
should result in a gradual weakening trend with time as storms move
eastward. However, strong low/midlevel flow and favorable deep-layer
shear will continue to support organized convection through late
morning, with an attendant threat of locally damaging gusts and
perhaps a tornado across the remaining portion of WW 3, and also
potentially into adjacent parts of far western VA.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM THE
TENNESSEE VALLEY INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS...

...SUMMARY...
Multiple rounds of isolated severe thunderstorms may occur across
parts of the southern Appalachians and Tennessee Valley, mainly this
morning and later in the afternoon to early evening.

...TN Valley into the Southern Appalachians...
A line of thunderstorms is ongoing this morning from western WV into
south-central KY, along a weak cold front progressing eastward
across the region. The warm sector ahead of this front is
characterized by temperatures in the low/mid 60s, dewpoints in the
low 60s, and modest buoyancy. Strong vertical shear exists across
this region as well, with mesoanalysis estimating effective bulk
shear values around 50-55 kt. Notable low-level curvature exists
over the region as well, supported by strong low-level flow (i.e.
850 mb flow over 50 kt). These environmental conditions are
supporting occasional updraft organization with the convective line,
with a resulting potential for a few brief tornadoes as well as
strong gusts and small hail. Shortwave trough responsible for the
cold front as well as the strong low-level flow will continue to
lift northeastward towards the Lower Great Lakes/northern
Appalachians this morning. Resultant weakening of the large-scale
ascent and low-level shear will likely lead to a weakening of this
convective line by the late morning.

The cold front is expected to continue gradually southward, and by
the early afternoon will likely extend from far western VA
west-southwestward across northern TN into northern AR. Another
low-amplitude shortwave trough is expected to move through the
region, contributing to another round of thunderstorms in the
vicinity of this front. Thunderstorms are possible on both sides of
the cold front, with greater storm coverage likely north of the
boundary where large-scale ascent will be strongest. Vertical shear
will be strong enough to support hail within a few of these elevated
storms. 

Potential for surface-based storms will exist south of the boundary,
with the degree of buoyancy modulated by how much heating is
realized. Current guidance suggests temperatures could reach the low
70s, which would result in MLCAPE around 1000 J/kg. Fast, nearly
unidirectional zonal flow regime will yield mid/upper-level
hodograph elongation. This should foster potential for an organized
cluster to develop by late afternoon, centered on the western/middle
TN vicinity. Localized damaging winds and marginally severe hail may
accompany this convection as it moves across TN and into far western
NC by early evening.

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated thunderstorms will be possible across northern/central
California this afternoon and evening.

...Northern/Central CA...
Morning water vapor imagery shows a shortwave trough approaching the
coast of northern CA.  An associated surface cold front is also
moving southeastward into northern CA, with an increasingly large
shield of showers along/ahead of the front.  Forecast soundings show
the development of very weak CAPE later today, which could result in
a few lightning flashes within the embedded precip shield.  No
severe storms are expected.

...DISCUSSION...
Medium-range models are in reasonably good agreement through day 6
(Sunday), in terms of large-scale features.  Substantial divergence
begins thereafter, casting substantial uncertainty into the forecast
beyond the upcoming weekend.

Day 4, as an upper short-wave trough crossing the Northeast moves
into/across the Canadian Maritimes, the quasi-zonal flow pattern
over the U.S. will continue.  Weak amplification of the flow will
occur over the West with time, however, as a short-wave trough moves
across the Rockies.  As this occurs, frontal low development is
expected along the persistent west-to-east front lying from the
southern Plains to the Mid-Atlantic region.  However, with only weak
instability expected near the developing low, and eastward along the
front, convection is forecast to remain disorganized.

Day 5, the upper wave is forecast to continue eastward across the
central and northern Plains through the day, and into and across the
Great Lakes region overnight.  The associated frontal low --
initially progged to lie over the Oklahoma vicinity, will deepen as
it shifts east-northeastward with time, reaching the northeast
through the end of the period.  The trailing surface front will
sharpen and advance southeastward, extending from the Mid-Atlantic
region southwestward to coastal Texas late.  While showers and a few
thunderstorms will be associated with the frontal advance, weak
instability anticipated at this time should again hinder convective
intensity.

Day 6, as the low moves offshore and the front continues advancing
steadily southeastward, it should clear the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts
during the evening, lingering only across Florida through the end of
the period.  The continued trend of weak instability, as well as
weakening flow with southward extent, should hinder prospects for
more robust convection.
