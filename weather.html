Day 1 Convective Outlook

0749 AM CDT Wed May 14 2025

Valid 141300Z - 151200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PORTIONS OF
THE CENTRAL AND NORTHERN PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong to severe thunderstorms are possible mainly over
parts of the Dakotas and Nebraska this afternoon and evening, and
far western Iowa and southwest Minnesota overnight. A few strong to
severe storms may occur from parts of the southern Appalachians to
the Carolinas and Mid-Atlantic this afternoon.

...Northern/Central Plains...
Surface low pressure will deepen in the vicinity of the CO/KS/NE
border today in response to the approach of an upper-level trough,
as an associated surface cold front moves slowly east across the
central/northern Plains. Low-level moisture advection and steep
mid-level lapse rates (in excess of 8 deg C/km) will result in
MLCAPE of 2500-3000 J/kg across central NE, with weaker instability
northward across the central Dakotas. Thunderstorm development is
expected by late afternoon near the front across the Dakotas and
central/northern NE, with severe hail and wind the primary risks.
Damaging winds will become more likely as one or two clusters
ultimately evolve over central/northern NE and move towards
southeast SD/southwest MN and far northwest IA during the late
evening and overnight.

Across southwest/central NE, more discrete supercell structures will
be possible with storms developing closer to the surface low/dryline
intersection, with large to very large hail possible. A 5 percent
tornado probability has been introduced across portions of central
NE, where a short-duration window may exist for a couple of
tornadoes this evening with any semi-discrete storm or small cluster
in the presence of increasing low-level shear. Expected upscale
growth should limit the time frame for supercell tornado potential. 


...Southern Appalachians into the Carolinas and Mid-Atlantic...
Weak to moderate instability will develop from the southern 
Appalachians to the Carolinas Wednesday. As a mid-level shortwave
trough overspreads the region, scattered thunderstorms are expected
to develop. Sufficient shear of 25 to 30 knots will support some
storm organization including potential for transient supercell
structures. Modestly steep mid-level lapse rates should support the
potential for large hail and perhaps isolated damaging wind gusts.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0353 AM CDT Wed May 14 2025

Valid 171200Z - 221200Z

...DISCUSSION...
An active period of severe weather remains likely through the
weekend and into early next week for portions of the central CONUS.
A weakening upper trough is forecast to migrate across the Northeast
late this weekend as a second upper wave begins to amplify over the
western states. This upper regime will favor surface pressure falls
across the High Plains that will promote south/southeasterly return
flow into the southern/central Plains through early next week.
Severe thunderstorm chances will increase as preceding upper
disturbances and the primary upper wave eject into the Plains over
the warm sector. While severe weather chances are anticipated most
days through the extended period, confidence in more focused,
synoptically-driven corridors is currently greatest on D5/Sunday and
D6/Monday across the southern Plains.

...D5/Sunday to D6/Monday...
Increasing southwesterly flow aloft over the southern/central
Rockies will promote lee cyclogenesis across the central High Plains
beginning D4/Saturday through D7/Monday. This will foster moisture
return into northern TX, OK, and southern KS as a warm front lifts
north. Long-range ensemble guidance suggests dewpoints ranging from
the mid 60s to low 70s are likely by Sunday afternoon across the
southern High Plains to the east of a sharpening dryline. Recent
GFS/GEFS solutions have come into better alignment with ECMWF/EPS
runs that depict a leading impulse within the subtropical jet
overspreading the southern High Plains late Sunday afternoon.
Enhanced westerly low- to mid-level flow coupled with ascent
associated with the upper feature should promote eastward mixing of
the dryline with attendant chances for thunderstorm development
within a buoyant and strongly sheared environment. 

The ejection of the primary trough axis on D6/Monday should result
in more widespread 50+ knot mid-level flow overspreading much of
OK/KS. The eastward migration of the surface low and trailing
dryline through the day should provide adequate forcing for ascent
for thunderstorm development within a buoyant and strongly sheared
environment, which should promote an organized, and potentially more
widespread, severe threat. 

More specific mesoscale details for both days remain unclear at this
range, but the general alignment of global deterministic/ensemble
guidance regarding the overall synoptic regime and convective
environment, combined with a consistent QPF signal on both days,
suggests predictability is high enough to introduce risk
probabilities.

...D4/Saturday...
A residual cold front associated with a weakening surface low over
the northern CONUS is expected to be draped from the southern
Appalachians southwestward into the mid-MS Valley/Ozark Plateau
region. Sufficient buoyancy and strong zonal flow aloft will likely
support organized convection along the frontal zone. While some
severe threat is anticipated, mid-level ridging and lingering
convection at the start of the day limit confidence/predictability
in where the better mesoscale corridors for severe convection will
become established. 

...D7/Tuesday...
Some severe threat is expected to persist into Tuesday as a surface
low and attendant trough/dryline migrate east towards the Midwest.
Ensemble guidance hints at strong/severe thunderstorm potential
across parts of AR, MO, and the lower OH Valley, but spread among
deterministic solutions and the potential for lingering convection
from D6/Monday limits confidence at this range.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
NORTH CAROLINA INTO THE SOUTHERN MID-ATLANTIC...CENTRAL GULF COAST
STATES...AND THE NORTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Marginally severe thunderstorms will be possible from this afternoon
into tonight across parts of North Carolina, the Mid-Atlantic,
central Gulf Coast states, and northern High Plains.

...DISCUSSION...
No change is made to the outlook for this issuance.

..Broyles.. 05/13/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1122 AM CDT Tue May 13 2025/

...North Carolina into the Southern Mid-Atlantic...
A closed mid/upper-level low will continue to slowly meander from
the TN Valley towards the central Appalachians through the period.
An embedded mid-level shortwave trough will rotate northward across
the Carolinas into the southern Mid-Atlantic by this evening.
Stronger low/mid-level flow will tend to remain across the eastern
Carolinas into southern VA today, with generally weaker winds aloft
in closer proximity to the mid/upper low. A moist low-level airmass
will remain in place over much of the Carolinas, central
Appalachians, and southern Mid-Atlantic. But, poor mid-level lapse
rates will tend to limit any more than weak instability from
developing through this afternoon. Deep-layer shear away from the
coast will also tend to remain muted, which should keep overall
thunderstorm organization modest. Even with these forecast
thermodynamic and kinematic limitations, some organization may occur
with thunderstorms that develop and spread northward this afternoon.
Isolated damaging winds appear to be the main threat with any
loosely organized clusters that can form, but marginally severe hail
could also occur with the strongest cores. A tornado or two also
appears possible along a pseudo-warm front across northeast NC into
southeast VA and vicinity, where low-level flow and shear are
forecast to be modestly enhanced compared to locations farther west.

...Mississippi/Alabama...
Morning showers and related cloudiness will temper diurnal
destabilization to some extent across northern MS/AL this afternoon.
But, renewed thunderstorm development still appears possible later
today across this region, on the southern fringe of the slowly
moving mid/upper low. Weak low-level westerly winds are expected to
veer to northwesterly and gradually strengthen with height though
mid levels. Related 30-40 kt of deep-layer shear will conditionally
support organized updrafts, including the potential for a supercell
with an associated hail/wind threat. The overall severe risk should
remain quite isolated, which warrants maintaining the Marginal Risk
with this update.

...Northern Plains...
An amplified mid/upper-level trough will move eastward over the
western states through tonight. A surface cold front is forecast to
decelerate and eventually stall over parts of the Dakotas by this
evening. Stronger mid/upper-level flow is expected to remain
displaced to the west of this surface boundary. Even so, there are
some indications in guidance that elevated thunderstorms posing a
threat for isolated hail may impact parts of the northern Plains
this evening into tonight. Weak instability should tend to limit the
overall severe threat.

Valid 141200Z - 151200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHWEST...

Minor adjustments were made to bring the Elevated area further north
into northwestern New Mexico and far eastern Arizona to account for
latest trends in ensemble guidance. Otherwise, the outlook remains
on track. See previous discussion below for more information.

..Thornton.. 05/13/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0159 AM CDT Tue May 13 2025/

...Synopsis...
The upper trough over the western US will continue to intensify as
it emerges over the Rockies and onto the Plains Wednesday. Strong
mid-level flow will strengthen a lee cyclone with a trailing cold
front and dryline across the Great Plains. Dry westerly flow is
likely over the Southwest where critical fire-weather conditions are
expected. A more conditional threat for locally elevated
fire-weather conditions exist over the Plains and Midwest ahead of
the cold front.

...Southwest...
As the main upper trough begins to move eastward over the Plains,
the fire weather threat will persist for portions of Southwest. 
Moderate mid-level flow at the base of the upper-trough will support
westerly downslope winds to 20-25 mph across southern New Mexico and
eastern AZ Wednesday afternoon and evening. Amidst a very dry
surface pattern with little recent rainfall and abnormally warm
temperatures, RH values below 15% are likely. With sufficient fuels
in place, and expanding in coverage from recent drying, widespread
critical fire-weather conditions are likely Wednesday.

...Central plains and upper Midwest...
As the upper trough moves eastward, a lee trough/dryline will
gradually sharpen across the central CONUS. To the west, dry
downslope flow is possible over parts of the central/northern Plains
into the Upper Midwest. With RH minimums below 30% and wind gusting
to 20 mph, some elevated fire-weather threat may be possible across
parts of CO/KS and NE into the Dakotas. However, the strongest
meteorological conditions are not expected to overlap with areas of
supportive fuels given rainfall over the past week. Increasing
surface moisture and some precipitation potential with the advancing
cold front may further limit any appreciable overlap. This will
favor a more localized threat with only isolated elevated
fire-weather conditions expected.

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER MUCH OF
WISCONSIN...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are likely across parts of the
western Great Lakes states and into parts of the Midwest Thursday
afternoon and evening. Very large hail and a few tornadoes may
occur. A more isolated/conditional severe threat will extend
southwestward from western Kentucky into Arkansas late.

...Synopsis...
An upper low will deepen over the northern Plains as a midlevel wave
ejects northeastward toward the upper MS Valley. A surface low will
also deepen over ND/MN, with occlusion. Extending southeast from the
low will be a warm front, which will rapidly jump into northern MN
and WI by late afternoon, and through much of Lower MI during the
evening. Southeast winds near this boundary will bring mid to
perhaps upper 60s F dewpoints northwestward, resulting in areas of
strong instability. Given the fast motion of the shortwave trough
and strongly veering winds in the low-levels, the primary severe
risk area may be relatively narrow.

The main front/dryline will stall near the OH River or Mid MS Valley
and southwestward toward the Ozarks. This corridor, primarily later
in the evening, will likely foster isolated severe storms  as well.

Elsewhere, a lingering upper trough will exit the Northeast, and
warm advection on the backside of this feature may support isolated
strong to severe storms from parts of PA into the Mid Atlantic
during the day. 

...Upper MS Valley/Great Lakes/Midwest...
Models are in good agreement depicting a strong convective signal
near the MN/WI border by 20Z or so, with increasing coverage points
east through evening. Forecast soundings across WI and vicinity
depict steep lapse rates aloft and hodographs favoring supercells. A
strong tornado cannot be ruled out given the very favorable
thermodynamics, including a slight capping inversion atop the moist
boundary layer in combination with 200-300 m2/s2 ESRH. 

Southeast of the Enhanced Risk area into IL and IN, storm coverage
looks to be more isolated. However, any supercells in this area will
have the same significant hail and tornado potential as points
north. This activity would likely wait until late in the day/after
21Z and closer to 00Z when heating is maximized to break the cap. 

Nocturnal severe storms will also be likely across much of Lower MI,
northern IN and OH as activity moves in from the west. Supercells
producing large hail again appear likely.

...OH Valley into AR Late...
The aforementioned stalled boundary will be situated beneath
persistent southwest flow at 850 mb Thursday evening and overnight.
Robust moisture/high theta-e will be in place from eastern OK into
the OH Valley, and scattered storms are likely to develop overnight.
This area is a bit more conditional in terms of  coverage of severe,
but clearly large hail will be possible. A brief tornado may occur
as well although hodographs will be primarily straight by this time.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PARTS OF THE
DAKOTAS...NEBRASKA...AND WESTERN IOWA AND SOUTHWEST MINNESOTA...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong to severe thunderstorms are possible mainly over
parts of the Dakotas and Nebraska Wednesday afternoon and evening,
and perhaps into far western Iowa and southwest Minnesota overnight.
A few strong gusts may occur over parts of the Southeast and
Mid-Atlantic Wednesday afternoon.

...Synopsis...
A potent upper speed max will move from the Four Corners area into
the central Plains late Wednesday, with the overall trough taking on
a negative tilt from MT into NE late. During the daytime, southerly
flow and cooling aloft will proceed eastward across the northern
Plains, where a surface trough will also deepen. This will provide a
focus for afternoon storms, with additional activity late in the day
over the central High Plains in association with the ejecting upper
wave.

To the east, a weakening upper trough will continue lifting north
across the OH Valley, Great Lakes and Mid Atlantic, with cool
temperatures aloft aiding daytime destabilization for scattered
thunderstorms.

...Northern Plains...
A north-south line of convection is forecast to form within the
surface trough across the central Dakotas by 00Z, with additional
activity developing over western NE. Shear will be marginal early
on, but cool temperatures aloft and 1500-2000 J/kg MUCAPE will favor
hail and locally strong gusts.  During the evening and overnight,
the environment will change rapidly as the upper trough approaches.
Additional cooling aloft as well as developing 850 mb warm front
should support an MCS or two, with damaging wind and hail both
spreading across central and northern NE, eastern SD, and finally
into western IA and southwest MN. Capping should limit southward
development, perhaps to I-80 or so.

...Mid Atlantic Region...
Cool midlevel temperatures will remain from the OH Valley into the
Mid Atlantic beneath the ejecting upper trough. Dewpoints in the 60s
F along with daytime heating will lead to pockets of 1500 J/kg
MLCAPE, with generally weak but veering winds with height. Scattered
storms appear most likely over central NC and VA, and a few strong
wind gusts cannot be ruled out.

The Elevated and Critical areas across the southwestern US were
expanded to include portions of northern Arizona and northwestern
New Mexico. Morning observations indicate critical meteorological
conditions are ongoing across these regions. Though some guidance
keeps relative humidity just above critical values, it appears
windy/drier solutions are verifying more closely to observations.
Fuels along the Mogollon Rim and favored downslope regions are
around the 75th percentile, which supports inclusion into the
Critical. Fuels near the Four Corners and in northwestern New Mexico
remain around the 50th percentile as such were included in the
Elevated.

The Elevated and Critical in the northern Plains was maintained with
this outlook. See previous discussion for more information.

..Thornton.. 05/13/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0155 AM CDT Tue May 13 2025/

...Synopsis...
Western US trouhging will deepen and begin to spread eastward as
upper-level blocking breaks down over the central US today. A lee
low will aid strong southwesterly winds and dry downslope conditions
across the Southwest and High Plains. With little recent rainfall
and above normal temperatures overlapping the increased surface
winds, critical fire-weather conditions are expected.

...Northern Plains...
Hot, dry and breezy conditions are again expected across parts of
the Red River Valley of the North and upper Midwest, as a strong lee
low supporting dry southerly winds over the northern Plains. Ahead
of a surface trough and cold front gusty southerly winds of 20-25
mph are likely across the eastern Dakotas and western MN through the
afternoon. Abnormally warm temperatures and modest moisture
advection should keep afternoon RH values below 30%. With very dry
fuels (ERC >90th percentile), several hours of widespread elevated
to critical conditions appear likely.

...Southwest...
The deepening upper trough over the western US will begin to move
eastward today, spreading strong westerly flow over the Southwest
and southern Rockies. The accelerating mid-level flow over a deep,
dry boundary layer with above normal temperatures will bring gusty
west-southwest winds of 15-25 mph to much of the Southwest. Fuels
continue to dry/cure farther north into eastern AZ and western
NM,supporting widespread elevated and critical fire-weather
conditions.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1122 AM CDT Tue May 13 2025

Valid 131630Z - 141200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
NORTH CAROLINA INTO THE SOUTHERN MID-ATLANTIC...CENTRAL GULF COAST
STATES...AND NORTHERN PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated strong to severe thunderstorms appear possible today and
tonight across parts of North Carolina into the southern
Mid-Atlantic, central Gulf Coast states, and northern Plains.

...North Carolina into the Southern Mid-Atlantic...
A closed mid/upper-level low will continue to slowly meander from
the TN Valley towards the central Appalachians through the period.
An embedded mid-level shortwave trough will rotate northward across
the Carolinas into the southern Mid-Atlantic by this evening.
Stronger low/mid-level flow will tend to remain across the eastern
Carolinas into southern VA today, with generally weaker winds aloft
in closer proximity to the mid/upper low. A moist low-level airmass
will remain in place over much of the Carolinas, central
Appalachians, and southern Mid-Atlantic. But, poor mid-level lapse
rates will tend to limit any more than weak instability from
developing through this afternoon. Deep-layer shear away from the
coast will also tend to remain muted, which should keep overall
thunderstorm organization modest. Even with these forecast
thermodynamic and kinematic limitations, some organization may occur
with thunderstorms that develop and spread northward this afternoon.
Isolated damaging winds appear to be the main threat with any
loosely organized clusters that can form, but marginally severe hail
could also occur with the strongest cores. A tornado or two also
appears possible along a pseudo-warm front across northeast NC into
southeast VA and vicinity, where low-level flow and shear are
forecast to be modestly enhanced compared to locations farther west.

...Mississippi/Alabama...
Morning showers and related cloudiness will temper diurnal
destabilization to some extent across northern MS/AL this afternoon.
But, renewed thunderstorm development still appears possible later
today across this region, on the southern fringe of the slowly
moving mid/upper low. Weak low-level westerly winds are expected to
veer to northwesterly and gradually strengthen with height though
mid levels. Related 30-40 kt of deep-layer shear will conditionally
support organized updrafts, including the potential for a supercell
with an associated hail/wind threat. The overall severe risk should
remain quite isolated, which warrants maintaining the Marginal Risk
with this update.

...Northern Plains...
An amplified mid/upper-level trough will move eastward over the
western states through tonight. A surface cold front is forecast to
decelerate and eventually stall over parts of the Dakotas by this
evening. Stronger mid/upper-level flow is expected to remain
displaced to the west of this surface boundary. Even so, there are
some indications in guidance that elevated thunderstorms posing a
threat for isolated hail may impact parts of the northern Plains
this evening into tonight. Weak instability should tend to limit the
overall severe threat.

Mesoscale Discussion 0774
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0746 AM CDT Tue May 13 2025

Areas affected...Parts of eastern NC into southeast VA

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 131246Z - 131445Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...A localized brief-tornado and wind-damage threat may
persist through the morning.

DISCUSSION...Extensive convection is ongoing this morning across
eastern NC into southeast VA. Weak instability (MLCAPE generally 500
J/kg or less) is limiting updraft intensity, with lightning
primarily confined to somewhat deeper convection near the NC coast.
However, to the east of the slow-moving midlevel cyclone centered
over western TN/KY, rather strong low-level flow continues to be
noted on the KMHX and KAKQ VWPs, supporting effective SRH of 150-200
m2/s2. Small cells with occasional rotation have persisted from
northeast NC into far southeast VA, and some localized threat for a
brief tornado and wind damage could persist through the morning with
these smaller cells. 

Farther south, an extensive convective cluster is ongoing off the NC
coast, with some evidence of an MCV south of Morehead City. This
cluster could spread northward toward the immediate coast and Outer
Banks with time, with embedded cells potentially posing a threat of
strong gusts and a brief tornado, especially where surface dewpoints
remain near 70 F this morning.

Mesoscale Discussion 0765
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0139 PM CDT Sun May 11 2025

Areas affected...eastern Idaho into western Wyoming and southwest
Montana

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 111839Z - 112115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Storms should gradually increase in coverage and intensity
from eastern Idaho into southwest Montana, with both hail and gust
potential.

DISCUSSION...A line of convection continue to increase in intensity
over the upper Snake River Plain, with both strong heating and
low-level warm advection ahead of it. Continued steepening of
deep-layer lapse rates as the upper trough moves in the from the
west and more heating should support further strengthening of this
convection. Strong deep-layer shear will favor hail production with
these storms over eastern ID. A brief/weak tornado cannot be ruled
out with the stronger cells this afternoon, as low-level stretching
is maximized.

Farther north toward the Bitterroots, stronger cooling aloft is
occurring, and areas of heating persist ahead of this activity as
well. Long hodographs and cold midlevel temperatures will favor hail
with these storms through the day.

Mesoscale Discussion 0767
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0221 PM CDT Sun May 11 2025

Areas affected...central Florida northward toward southeast Georgia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 111921Z - 112145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Storms are forecast to increase in coverage throughout the
afternoon from the central Florida Peninsula into northeast Florida
and southeast Georgia.

DISCUSSION...Storms are currently increasing east of Tampa to west
of Okeechobee where strong heating has led to strong instability.
The southerly flow regime should support a north/northeast movement
to this development, affecting the remainder of central into
northeastern Florida. Breaks in the clouds in those downstream areas
are developing, and this should further increase instability.
Although temperatures aloft are not as cool as previous days, MUCAPE
over 2000 J/kg and deep-layer shear of 35-40 kt will support
cellular storm mode with sporadic hail > 1.00" expected. Locally
strong to damaging gusts cannot be ruled out as well, especially
with any merging outflows.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 245
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
110 PM MDT Sun May 11 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Eastern Idaho
  Northern Utah
  Western Wyoming

* Effective this Sunday afternoon and evening from 110 PM until
  800 PM MDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 80
    mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm intensity and coverage is expected to
increase this afternoon across eastern ID, northern UT, and western
WY. Environmental conditions support the potential for strong to
severe storms capable of strong gusts. Isolated large hail is also
possible, particularly in areas of higher terrain.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 80
statute miles east and west of a line from 65 miles north northeast
of Idaho Falls ID to 40 miles southwest of Salt Lake City UT. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU5).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
1.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 70 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
23035.

0149 PM CDT Sun May 11 2025

Areas affected...Portions of southeast Georgia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 111849Z - 112045Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...A locally greater risk for damaging winds and perhaps a
tornado is evident in southeast Georgia near a local warm front
feature.

DISCUSSION...A small corridor in southeast Georgia has heated into
the low 80s F. A few weak discrete cells exist near the
Georgia/South Carolina state line. One cell has recently intensified
and shown signs of low-level rotation. The localized warm front
feature will promote at least marginal potential for a brief tornado
with southeasterly winds near the boundary. Nearby KCLX radar
accordingly shows modest 0-1 km SRH. Over the next hour or two this
environment will support a locally greater risk for damaging winds
and perhaps a tornado. The discrete cells will have the greatest
potential, but stronger updrafts within the linear segment farther
southwest could also acquire low-level rotation as well.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0130 PM CDT Sun May 11 2025

Areas affected...Salt Lake Vicinity

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 111830Z - 112030Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Severe wind gusts will be possible this afternoon with
high-based showers and embedded thunderstorms.

DISCUSSION...With temperatures rising into the low/mid 80s F in the
vicinity of Salt Lake, high-based showers and isolated thunderstorms
have deepened over the last hour. A few of these storms have
produced 58-63 mph measured gusts in Tooele/Salt Lake Counties.
While low-level wind fields are not overly strong, the 9.2 C/km
700-500 mb lapse rate observed in this mornings 12Z SLC sounding,
coupled with steep low-level lapse rates and high surface dewpoint
depressions, will continue to support strong diabatically driven
downdrafts. Severe wind gusts will remain possible through the
afternoon in association with this weak, disorganized convection.
