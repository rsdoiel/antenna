Mesoscale Discussion 0131
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0856 AM CST Tue Mar 04 2025

Areas affected...Isolated wind gusts remain possible through this
morning.

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 19...

Valid 041456Z - 041630Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 19
continues.

SUMMARY...Isolated wind gusts remain possible through this morning.

DISCUSSION...The intensity of the squall line across northeast
Oklahoma has weakened over the past 30 minutes as it moves into an
increasingly stable/cool downstream airmass. Some recovery may may
continue to occur across northern Arkansas and southern Missouri
which may provide just enough instability to maintain the squall
line as it continues east. Given the very strong low-level flow, (60
knots at 1km per SRX VWP), some threat for isolated severe wind
gusts may continue despite the less intense squall line,
particularly in the southern portions of watch 19 where mid-50s
dewpoints and slightly greater instability are present.

Mesoscale Discussion 0130
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0749 AM CST Tue Mar 04 2025

Areas affected...Arklatex into the Sabine Valley and vicinity

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 041349Z - 041545Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...A severe wind, and eventually tornado risk exists over the
area, ahead of the cold front and near and south of the warm front.
A watch may be considered.

DISCUSSION...Although a greater threat of severe storms including
tornadoes is expected into the afternoon, some severe risk may
persist with the ongoing early day activity as a line of storms
continues east out of TX and eastern OK.

12Z soundings indicate a capping inversion near 700 mb, by virtue of
relatively cool surface conditions near the warm front. However,
very strong southerly winds above the surface with the low-level
jet, as well as areas of daytime heating will allow for a growing
area of concern across the developing warm sector, including much of
LA and into MS.

In the near term, robust storms persist along the cold front over
northeast TX, with a few counties width of warm sector west of the
warm front. At least a few hours of severe risk likely remains in
this area, prior to expected diurnal maximum, and a watch will
likely be needed to address this early threat.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 20
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
815 AM CST Tue Mar 4 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Southern Arkansas
  Western and Northern Louisiana
  East Texas

* Effective this Tuesday morning and afternoon from 815 AM until
  300 PM CST.

* Primary threats include...
  A few tornadoes and a couple intense tornadoes possible
  Scattered damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 75
    mph likely
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...A broken squall line will continue east into the Watch
area this morning.  A destabilizing airmass near and immediately
ahead of this strong to severe thunderstorm activity will aid in a
severe risk continuing eastward through the early afternoon. 
Scattered severe gusts and a risk for tornadoes will be the primary
hazards with the stronger storms.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 75 statute miles
east and west of a line from 25 miles northwest of Pine Bluff AR to
60 miles southwest of Fort Polk LA. For a complete depiction of the
watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU0).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM
SOUTHEASTERN OKLAHOMA/NORTHEASTERN TEXAS EAST-SOUTHEASTWARD TO
SOUTHERN ALABAMA AND WESTERN PARTS OF THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms with a threat for tornadoes, damaging winds,
and isolated hail are possible today from eastern portions of the
southern Plains into the lower Mississippi Valley and Southeast. A
couple strong tornadoes will be possible.

...North and East Texas and Oklahoma eastward to the southern
Appalachians/Southeast...
Water-vapor imagery shows a large-scale mid to upper-level trough
moving east across the central and southern High Plains this
morning.  Several embedded perturbations are rotating through the
larger-scale upper feature with the most notable feature being a
100+ kt 500-mb speed max forecast to move from south-central TX
through the lower MS Valley and into the TN Valley/Mid South
tonight.  Meanwhile a deepening surface low will move from KS into
the mid MS Valley during the period as a cold front sweeps east
across the Mid South and central Gulf Coast later today/tonight.  

A severe squall line is ongoing this morning from central TX
north-northeastward into eastern OK.  Intense shear profiles within
an adequately unstable warm/moist sector will favor severe gusts
with the bowing segments as this mature squall line rapidly moves
east across eastern OK/TX this morning.  A risk for a few tornadoes
will accompany the band of storms as this activity moves east across
the Ark-La-Tex and into the Ark-La-Miss during the day.  Forecast
soundings show very large hodographs which will support storm-scale
rotation with the stronger cells either embedded within or that can
develop ahead of the squall line.  Strong tornado potential exists
given the wind field across the lower MS Valley where diurnal
destabilization and northward-returning Gulf moisture will aid in
storm intensity/coverage.  

This activity will likely maintain a linear mode tonight as it moves
east across the central Gulf Coast states into the TN Valley.  A
continued risk for damaging gusts and tornadoes will become the
primary severe hazards.  Have expanded Slight-Risk and Enhanced-Risk
equivalent severe probabilities farther east across southern AL and
southwestern GA where confidence in a surface-based severe threat
appear greatest.  

...Eastern Kansas to western Illinois...
As the upper low pivots eastward across Oklahoma and Kansas through
the day, and into Missouri by evening, cold air aloft accompanying
the low will yield steep mid-level lapse rates.  Any daytime heating
in the wake of initial/prior convection across the northeastern
Kansas vicinity could yield enough CAPE for isolated, low-topped
convective redevelopment.  Assuming this scenario manifests, a
couple of the strongest storms could pose marginal risk for
hail/wind and possibly a tornado.  Any such risk would taper by
evening.

Farther east, across Missouri and into western Illinois, elevated
storms east of the primary zone of convection may pose limited/local
risk for marginal hail during the morning and into the afternoon
hours.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0140 AM CST Tue Mar 04 2025

Valid 051200Z - 061200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Upper ridging will build over the Plains states as a mid-level
trough ejects into the Atlantic and a second upper trough amplifies
across the Southwest tomorrow (Wednesday). As such, relatively more
quiescent wildfire-spread conditions are likely across the southern
Plains compared to previous days. Broad northwesterly mid-level flow
may transport downward via a mixed boundary-layer mixing across the
southern Plains. However, marginal RH and the recent occurrence of
appreciable rainfall accumulations precludes Elevated highlights at
this time. Dry and occasionally breezy conditions will also return
to eastern New Mexico ahead of the aforementioned approaching upper
trough. However, surface winds appear too weak on a widespread basis
to justify the addition of fire weather highlights this outlook.

...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms appear unlikely through tonight.

...Synopsis...

A dearth of boundary-layer moisture and strong surface high pressure
east of the Rockies will preclude thunderstorm potential for the
remainder of this evening/overnight.
