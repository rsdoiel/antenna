Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0729 AM CDT Mon Oct 28 2024

Valid 281300Z - 291200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected today.

...Discussion...
Deep convective potential will remain limited today with severe
storms not expected. This will be influenced by an amplifying
large-scale pattern, highlights by strong height falls over the
West, particularly across the Great Basin to central/southern
Rockies. In this scenario, steep lapse rate profiles may support a
few flashes of lightning with shallow convection near the Pacific
Coast today. Increasing forcing for ascent and steepening lapse
rates across the interior Great Basin/Four Corners may contribute to
isolated convection, some of which may generate lightning later this
afternoon into evening.

Later tonight, primarily after 03Z, elevated thunderstorms are
expected to develop and spread east-northeastward across the Upper
Great Lakes. This will be a byproduct of a robustly strong
southwesterly low-level jet and warm advection regime emanating from
the central Plains toward the upper Mississippi Valley.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0357 AM CDT Mon Oct 28 2024

Valid 311200Z - 051200Z

...DISCUSSION...
...Thursday/Day 4 to Saturday/Day 6...
An upper-level trough is forecast to move eastward into the upper
Mississippi Valley on Thursday, and into the Northeast on Friday. At
the surface, a cold front is forecast to advance southeastward into
the Gulf Coast states. Thunderstorm development will be likely near
and ahead of the front Thursday afternoon and evening. Weak
instability and limited large-scale ascent should keep any severe
threat marginal.

From Friday into Saturday, low-level moisture return is expected to
take place further west into the southern Plains. Thunderstorms are
forecast to develop on Friday over parts of eastern New Mexico and
west Texas, with an isolated severe threat possible. On Saturday,
moisture and instability is forecast to increase across the southern
and central Plains, which could result in an expansion of severe
threat coverage. However, the latest models suggest that instability
will be relatively weak in most areas, helping to marginalize the
severe threat.

...Sunday/Day 7 and Monday/Day 8...
On Sunday and Monday, an upper-level system is forecast to move from
near the southern California coast into northwestern Mexico. Ahead
of the system, an anticyclonic and subtle southwesterly mid-level
flow pattern is forecast in the south-central U.S, where a moist
airmass should be located. Isolated to scattered thunderstorms are
expected to develop on both Sunday and Monday afternoons with this
airmass. The strongest instability is forecast to be near the
western edge of the moist airmass, suggesting the greatest severe
potential could be from west Texas extending north-northeastward
into the central Plains. Forecast instability should be relatively
weak, keeping any severe threat marginal.
