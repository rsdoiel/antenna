Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK

Valid 241200Z - 301200Z

Forecast guidance has come to a consensus for a cut off low which
will dominate the weather for much of the central and eastern CONUS
by the middle of this week. In addition, there is some potential for
tropical development which may eventually merge with this upper low
later this week. As this pattern evolves across the eastern CONUS,
ridging will build across the western CONUS. Some warmer conditions
are anticipated, however, winds are expected to be light across
areas with dry fuels. The only period with even elevated
fire-weather conditions forecast is on Day4/Wednesday when some dry
and breezy conditions may develop in the lee of the northern
Sierra/southern Cascades as a mid-level trough moves through the
Pacific Northwest. However, fuels are not critically dry in this
region. Therefore, only elevated conditions forecast at this time
and unreceptive fuels preclude the need for any critical
probabilities given the potential for fire-weather concerns is too
low.

Tropical Depression Ten-E Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP102024
300 PM CST Sun Sep 22 2024
 
Convection has gradually become better organized today in 
association with an area of low pressure that the NHC has been 
monitoring off the coast of southern Mexico. A recent scatterometer 
pass shows the circulation is closed, with a well-defined center and 
peak winds of about 30 kt over the southern semicircle. Therefore, a 
new tropical depression has formed in the eastern Pacific basin.
 
The depression is nearly stationary, but a slow northeastward drift 
is expected to begin later tonight. The track forecast is 
challenging, as there is a large spread in the guidance regarding 
the potential path of the system. Much of the track guidance shows 
the system moving generally east-northeastward as it becomes 
captured within the broader circulation of a developing Central 
American Gyre. However, a couple of global models (ECMWF and UKMET) 
instead show a northward drift over the next couple of days. The NHC 
track forecast favors the first scenario, and generally lies between 
the simple and corrected consensus aids. However, this track 
forecast is of low confidence given the large spread in the models, 
and adjustments will likely be required with future issuances.
 
The moist, unstable environment and very warm waters should be 
conducive for some strengthening of the system during the next 
couple of days. The NHC intensity forecast lies between the IVCN and 
HCCA aids, but it should be noted that there are some models 
indicating the system could reach hurricane strength. While this is 
not explicitly forecast, it certainly cannot be ruled out given the 
environmental and oceanic conditions, and interests along the coast 
of southern Mexico should monitor the latest forecast updates. The 
peak intensity of the system will be highly dependent on how long 
the cyclone remains over water before reaching the coast, which is 
quite uncertain given the track challenges described above.
 
Based on this forecast, the government of Mexico has issued a
Tropical Storm Watch for the southern coast of Mexico from Punta
Maldonado to Salina Cruz.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Slow-moving Tropical Depression Ten-E will bring very heavy
rainfall to coastal portions of southern and southwestern Mexico
through the upcoming week. This heavy rainfall will bring a risk of
significant flash flooding and mudslides to the Mexican States of
Chiapas and Oaxaca, particularly in areas near the coast.
 
2. The depression is forecast to become a tropical storm while
moving near the coast of southern Mexico on Monday or Tuesday. A
Tropical Storm Watch has been issued for a portion of the coastline,
where tropical storm conditions could begin on Tuesday.
 
3. The system could strengthen more than forecast if it remains
over water. Interests along the coast of southern Mexico should
monitor the latest forecast updates, as a Hurricane Watch could be
required for a portion of the coastline later tonight or on Monday.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM WEST TEXAS
INTO THE LOWER OHIO RIVER VALLEY...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms are possible from southwest/west Texas
to western Kentucky.

...20z Update...
The previous forecast remains on track with no adjustments required.
Convection across West Texas into central Oklahoma continues to
intensify per GOES IR imagery with further intensification probable
through late afternoon. In general, the Texas Low Rolling Plains and
portions of Ozarks remain relatively more favorable for organized
severe convection due to better diurnal destabilization (MLCAPE has
increased to 1500-2000 J/kg) along and ahead of the front, but
instances of sporadic hail/damaging gusts remain possible across
northwest TX into OK. See the previous discussion below for
additional details.

..Moore.. 09/22/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1127 AM CDT Sun Sep 22 2024/

...West Texas to the Ozarks and lower Ohio Valley...
Within a split flow regime, a southern-stream shortwave trough will
continue generally eastward while tending to weaken over the
south-central High Plains. Scattered showers and thunderstorms will
remain common near an east/southeastward-moving cold front that
extends from Lake Michigan southwestward across the middle
Mississippi Valley, with convection also occurring along/behind the
south/southeastward-moving portion of the front that extends from
the Ozarks across Oklahoma toward west/southwest Texas.

Outflows and cloud cover extending into the pre-frontal warm sector
will be factors, but somewhat stronger destabilization (possibly
1500-2000 J/kg MLCAPE) may occur by peak heating in areas such as
the Texas Low Rolling Plains/Permian Basin, and potentially parts of
the Ozarks. Moderately strong west-southwesterly flow aloft will
largely parallel the frontal zone, with near/pre-frontal effective
shear limited to 20-30 kt, with an exception being the elevated
convection from west/northwest Texas into Oklahoma where some
stronger cores could produce hail in the post-frontal environment.

Where storms intensify near the front this afternoon, strong to
locally damaging wind gusts (50-60 mph) and some hail (up to around
1 inch in diameter) will be possible through the early part of the
evening.

Valid 241200Z - 251200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorm potential appears low on Tuesday.

...Synopsis...
Broad troughing aloft will continue over much of the
northern/central Plains into the Midwest on Tuesday. A lead
shortwave perturbation will initially be located in the Ozarks/lower
Ohio Valley region and move northeastward and weaken with time. In
the Plains, another shortwave perturbation will dig southward into
the southern Plains by Wednesday morning. This feature will get cut
off from the stronger upper-level flow in the Upper Great Lakes.
Overall, a generally weakening upper-level system will promote weak
to modest height falls across parts of the Tennessee Valley with a
weak cold front/surface low moving slowly eastward with time.

...Tennessee Valley...
Early day precipitation potential will again be possible. The
location and degree of surface destabilization remains in question.
It is possible for a few storms to develop during the afternoon
along the cold front. Mid-level flow will be sufficient for modest
storm organization in the strongest storms. However, continued poor
mid-level lapse rates and lack of focused forcing for ascent leaves
coverage of potentially severe storms in doubt. While a conditional
threat for isolated large hail and damaging winds may develop,
severe probabilities will be withheld and trends in guidance will
continue to be monitored.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM WEST TEXAS
TO SOUTHERN MISSOURI...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms are possible on Sunday from west Texas
to central/southern Missouri.

...Synopsis...
A filling mid-level low will move toward the central High Plains on
Sunday afternoon/evening. Moderate mid-level flow will maintain
southeast of this low and overspread the Oklahoma/southern Kansas
vicinity. At the surface, a cold front will extend from southern
Michigan across Illinois and Missouri and into Oklahoma and Texas. 

...Southern Missouri across Oklahoma and into West Texas...
Thunderstorms will likely be ongoing along and ahead of the surface
front across the TX Panhandle and into Oklahoma and from central
Kansas, across Missouri, and to southern Illinois Sunday morning. A
seasonally moist airmass featuring upper 60s to perhaps low 70s
dewpoints will exist ahead of the surface front Sunday
afternoon/evening. Surface heating ahead of the front should result
in moderate instability amid a marginally sheared airmass. A few
stronger/organized storms are possible with a primary threat of
damaging wind gusts, especially where any clustering or line
segments can develop. Some large hail is also possible, where a few
supercells are possible across northwest Texas and West Texas. 

The severe threat will be primarily diurnally driven with minimal
severe concerns after 1-3 UTC.

1127 AM CDT Sat Sep 21 2024

Valid 211630Z - 221200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS OF
THE SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS....

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe storms capable of all hazards are possible this
afternoon and evening across portions of the southern High Plains.

...Southern High Plains...
A potent upper low and associated 65-75 kt mid-level jet max
centered over AZ are expected to quickly move eastward,
overspreading the southern Rockies/High Plains this afternoon and
evening. At the surface, sustained southerly flow ahead of a
deepening surface low and trailing cold front over western NM will
support moderate destabilization (MLCAPE 1500-2000 J/kg) with
afternoon heating and continued low-level upslope. As the mid-level
system approaches, mid-level height falls and flow aloft will
intensify, elongating low and mid-level hodographs, allowing for
convective development/organization in the form of supercells.

One source of continued uncertainty is the ongoing elevated
convection and cloud debris centered north of a diffuse surface
boundary stretching from central NM to the western TX Panhandle. So
far, this boundary has been slowly lifting north with pronounced
low-level theta-e advection taking place to the south. As deep-layer
ascent intensifies through the late morning, continued convective
development to the north may support reinforcement and stalling of
the boundary. The northward extent of destabilization remains
unclear, though this boundary could serve as a focus for renewed
development of more robust convection expected later this afternoon.


Most CAM guidance shows scattered thunderstorms initiating off the
higher terrain of eastern NM, or ahead of the cold front farther
west by early this afternoon. These storms should quickly mature
with supportive thermodynamics and kinematics, eventually spreading
eastward into the TX Panhandle. The risk for large to very large
hail/severe gusts will likely accompany the stronger supercells, and
a threat for a couple tornadoes may be realized later this
afternoon/early evening from eastern NM into parts of adjacent west
TX, especially near the boundary where low-level shear may be
locally enhanced.

...Upper Midwest and MO Valley...
A second upper low near the international border is forecast to
quickly move eastward reaching the western Great Lakes by early this
evening. Weak ascent is expected ahead of a surging cold front and
diffuse wave cyclone across the northern MO valley and southern MN.
Surface moistening with a warm front lifting north near the IA/MN
border may act as a focus for more robust convective development
along the cold front late this afternoon. Increasingly orthogonal
deep-layer flow and steeping low/mid-level lapse rates could support
a mix of supercells and multi-cell clusters. A few of the stronger
storms may pose some hail/wind threat, which should peak in
intensity during the early evening. However, somewhat limited
heating and the lack of broader forcing for ascent suggests storm
coverage should remain isolated.

...Western PA into the Mid Atlantic...
Short-wave troughing across the upper OH Valley within mid-level
northwesterly flow is expected to support isolated to widely
scattered thunderstorms across western PA/VA later this afternoon.
Model forecast soundings with moderate buoyancy and modest
deep-layer shear would imply some of the stronger storms being
capable of an isolated risk for wind damage (50-60 mph) and perhaps
some hail. This activity will likely diminish by early evening
coincident with nocturnal cooling.

as a cold front brings cooler temperatures and increasing
precipitation chances across much of the central/northern Plains.
Brief periods of Elevated fire weather concerns will be possible
across portions of New Mexico as enhanced mid-level flow rounds the
western US upper low. In this region, relative humidity reductions
to 15-20 percent will briefly overlap winds around 15-20 mph. Fuels
across this region remain unsupportive of large-fire spread at this
time with potential for additional rainfall from thunderstorm
activity on Saturday. As such, no areas were included with this
outlook.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0743 AM CDT Fri Sep 20 2024

Valid 201300Z - 211200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM SOUTHWEST
LOWER MICHIGAN INTO PARTS OF ILLINOIS...INDIANA...AND SOUTHEAST
MISSOURI...AND OVER PARTS OF THE CENTRAL PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated strong to severe thunderstorms are possible during the late
afternoon over parts of southwest Lower Michigan, Illinois, Indiana,
and southeast Missouri. Isolated strong to severe storms are also
possible across parts of the south-central Plains.

...Synopsis...
Shortwave trough currently moving through WI and Upper MI will
continue eastward through the Upper Great Lakes region today.
Another shortwave trough will follow quickly in its wake,
progressing across Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba, and adjacent
portions of MT and the northern Plains this evening and overnight.
Father south, a deep upper low with seasonably cold mid-level
temperatures will move from southern CA into AZ. Progression of this
low will dampen the northwestern periphery of the upper ridging
centered over TX. 

A surface low attendant to this WI/Upper MI shortwave trough is
currently near the IA/WI/IL border intersection, with weak cold
front extending southwestward from this low to another subtle
surface low over the central OK/KS border. Surface troughing
continues southwestward from this secondary low, but this portion of
the boundary has taken on more warm-front-like characteristics over
the past several hours (evidenced by the dewpoint increase of 3-4
deg F over the past 3 hours across the eastern TX/OK Panhandle).
Enhanced westerly/southwesterly flow aloft attendant to both the
central Canada/MT shortwave trough and CA upper low will contribute
to sharpening surface lee troughing throughout the day and into this
evening.

...Central Plains...
Low-level moisture is expected to advect northward/northwestward
throughout the day as Thursday's cold front returns northward as a
warm front. As a result, low to mid 60s dewpoints will likely be in
place across south-central/southeast KS during the late afternoon.
Dewpoints will likely be in upper 50s farther west in southwest KS,
with notably drier conditions across the adjacent TX/OK Panhandles
where downsloping southwesterly surface winds are likely. 

Southwesterly flow aloft ahead of the approaching upper low will
advect steep mid-level lapse rates northeastward through the
southern High Plains into western portions of the central Plains.
Modest buoyancy is anticipated during the late afternoon where these
lapse rates overlay the more favorable low-level moisture across
southern KS. Limited large-scale ascent and low-level confluence
near the warm front is anticipated over this region as well, with
isolated to widely scattered high-based thunderstorm anticipated.
Vertical shear will be modest, but still strong enough for
persist/organized storm structures, and the potential for some
strong gusts with the more robust storms. Some isolated hail is also
possible over south-central KS where buoyancy is maximized.  

Low-level moisture will continue advection northward during the
evening and overnight, with a strengthening low-level jet
anticipated as well. Consequently, additional thunderstorm
development is expected after 04Z over northeast KS and adjacent far
southeast NE and northwest MO. Isolated hail is possible with the
strongest storms.

...Southwestern Lower MI into IN, IL, and southeast MO...
Upper 60s to low 70s dewpoints are expected from southwest Lower MI
southwestward across western IN, southern IL, and southeast MO.
Daytime heating of this moist low-level air mass will yield a
moderately unstable and uncapped air mass ahead of the approaching
front, and thunderstorm development is anticipated as the front
interacts with this airmass. Moderate vertical shear will be in
place, but poor lapse rates and notable mid-level dry air could make
updraft maintenance difficult. As such, a more multicellular storm
mode is anticipated. Highest storm coverage is expected over
southwest Lower MI and western IN, with warm mid-level temperatures
likely limiting coverage across southern IL and southeast MO.
Locally strong gusts will be the primary severe risk, with isolated,
marginally severe hail possible as well.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 677
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
210 PM CDT Thu Sep 19 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Northern Iowa
  Southern and East-Central Minnesota
  Western Wisconsin

* Effective this Thursday afternoon and evening from 210 PM until
  1000 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail likely with isolated very large hail events
    to 2.5 inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms should continue to develop this afternoon
while posing a threat for large hail up to 1.5-2.5 inches in
diameter. As this activity spreads east-northeastward, damaging
winds around 60-70 mph may become more of a threat through this
evening, especially if thunderstorms can form into clusters. A
tornado or two also appears possible with any persistent,
surface-based supercell.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 75
statute miles east and west of a line from 45 miles north northwest
of Eau Claire WI to 15 miles southwest of Mason City IA. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU7).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
24030.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0356 AM CDT Thu Sep 19 2024

Valid 221200Z - 271200Z

...DISCUSSION...
Some severe potential is evident on both D4/Sunday and D5/Monday.
But both regimes appear to be focused on the mesoscale, rendering
insufficient predictability at this time frame for a 15 percent
highlight. A combination of both low predictability and potential is
apparent mid-week next week.

A southern-stream shortwave trough is expected to progress from the
Southwest into the central Great Plains on D4. A confined belt of
enhanced mid-level southwesterlies overspreading a corridor of rich
boundary-layer moisture just ahead of an attendant weak surface
cyclone may yield a severe-storm threat on Sunday afternoon. Per
consensus of latest guidance, the most favored area could be
centered around the Lower MO Valley. This shortwave trough may
continue northeastward towards the Upper MS Valley into D5. Guidance
spread increases with the degree of forward speed, along with
potential weakening of the flow fields surrounding the trough.
Still, a similar setup may occur on Monday in parts of the Midwest,
centered on the southwest Great Lakes region. Mid-level lapse rates
on both days are uniformly depicted to be weak, suggestive of
lower-end severe potential.

Mesoscale Discussion 2084
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0342 PM CDT Wed Sep 18 2024

Areas affected...The eastern Texas Panhandle into northwest Oklahoma
and southern Kansas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 182042Z - 182245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm development is expected by late
afternoon/early evening across the eastern Texas Panhandle and into
adjacent portions of northwest Oklahoma and southern Kansas.
Thunderstorm coverage should remain sufficiently isolated to
preclude watch issuance, but instances of severe hail/wind will be
possible.

DISCUSSION...Latest GOES imagery shows deepening cumulus along a
weakly confluent surface trough across the TX Panhandle into
southern KS. The southerly flow regime across the region has helped
offset the influence of diurnal mixing with dewpoints remaining the
low to mid 60s. Concurrently, temperatures are warming into the low
to mid 90s, which is eroding inhibition and supporting MLCAPE
upwards of around 1000 J/kg. Any further improvements to the
thermodynamic environment will be modest through late afternoon,
namely in the form of steepening low-level lapse rates as
temperatures peak in the mid to upper 90s. However, nearly zonal
30-35 knot flow aloft is supporting somewhat elongated mid-level
hodographs with similar effective bulk shear values. This kinematic
environment should support organized convection, including the
potential for a supercell or two with an attendant risk for large
hail (most likely up to 1.0-1.75 inches in diameter) and severe
winds. Based on the aforementioned satellite trends, at least a
couple of storms appear probable, but the fairly weak forcing for
ascent along the surface trough and stronger inhibition downstream
into OK and KS suggests that storm coverage and duration may be
limited. Consequently, watch issuance is unlikely.

Mesoscale Discussion 2083
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0253 PM CDT Wed Sep 18 2024

Areas affected...parts of eastern South Dakota...adjacent
northeastern Nebraska and southwestern Minnesota

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 181953Z - 182230Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...The initiation of one or two strong storms appears
possible late this afternoon.  Sustained storm development may
include the evolution of supercell structures posing a risk for
severe hail, and perhaps some potential for a tornado by early
evening.  Due to the isolated nature, it is not certain that a
severe weather watch is needed, but trends are being monitored.

DISCUSSION...Although stronger mid-level height falls appear to be
shifting to the north, a destabilizing warm sector boundary layer
across the eastern South Dakota vicinity will remain beneath weakly
difluent cyclonic mid-level flow into early evening.  With
mixed-layer CAPE now on the order of 1500 J/kg, beneath 30-50 kt
southwesterly mid/upper flow, the environment appears at least
conditionally supportive of supercells, and low-level hodographs may
enlarge with clockwise curvature as southerly flow around 850 mb is
forecast to strengthen some (to around 30+ kt) through 22-00Z.

Although low-level forcing for sustained convective development
remains unclear, weak warm advection to the east of the dryline may
be supporting ongoing attempts at deepening convection east of Huron
into the Watertown vicinity.  And objective analysis has indicated a
persistent localized area of enhanced convergence along a confluence
zone near/west of Yankton.

Model output, including the convection allowing guidance, suggest
that probabilities for thunderstorm development are generally low
into early evening.  However, the initiation of one or two storms
appears possible.  If this is sustained, this may include the
evolution of supercell structures posing a risk for severe hail, and
perhaps some potential for a tornado.

Post-Tropical Cyclone Ileana Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092024
800 AM MST Sun Sep 15 2024
 
Ileana has been devoid of deep convection since yesterday afternoon, 
as the system has been within a strong wind shear and very dry 
environment. Given the lack of convection, the system is being 
designated as a post-tropical remnant low.  An ASCAT-C pass from 
late last night depicted winds near 30 kt over the Gulf of 
California near northern Sinaloa.  Given this, will hold the 
intensity at 30 kt for this advisory, although that may be generous.
 
The system has been meandering over the Gulf of California with a 
motion of 310/3 kt.  The remnant low will increase forward speed 
later today as it continues northwestward.  The remnant low will 
continue to weaken throughout the day, and is forecast to dissipate 
on Monday. 

This is the last advisory on this system. For additional 
information on the remnant low please see High Seas Forecasts issued 
by the National Weather Service, under AWIPS header NFDHSFEPI, WMO 
header FZPN02 KWBC, and on the web at
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFEPI.php
