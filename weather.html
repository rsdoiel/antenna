Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0638 AM CDT Sun Jul 27 2025

Valid 271300Z - 281200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON AND
EVENING ACROSS PARTS OF THE UPPER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY INTO THE
WESTERN GREAT LAKES REGION...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms will be possible this afternoon and evening
from parts of the upper Mississippi Valley into the western Great
Lakes. Marginally severe storms will also be possible in parts of
the northern Plains, central Appalachians, Mid-Atlantic and eastern
North Carolina.

...Northern MN This Morning...
A persistent bowing MCS is over northern MN headed toward the
Arrowhead region.  These storms have produced locally damaging wind
gusts through much of the night, but have shown signs of weakening
on the north end of the bow during the past 1-2 hours.  One intense
cells remains on the south end of the bow, headed toward the Hibbing
vicinity.  This activity may continue to pose a risk of damaging
winds or hail for awhile this morning.

...Upper MS Valley into western Great Lakes...
A convectively aided shortwave trough is currently tracking across
ND.  This feature will move into northern MN this afternoon with an
associated surface cold front sagging into central MN.  Steep
mid-level lapse rates and strong heating ahead of the front will
result in a very unstable airmass this afternoon, with MLCAPE values
of 3000-4000 J/kg.  A consensus of CAM solutions suggests the
development of a few discrete supercells along the front by mid/late
afternoon.  These storms will be capable of very large hail and
perhaps a few tornadoes during the first couple of hours.  After
that, upscale growth is likely with damaging winds becoming the main
concern as storms build southeastward across southern MN and into
central WI.

...Mid Atlantic/Central Appalachians...
Scattered afternoon thunderstorms are expected once again today from
parts of PA/WV into VA/NC.  Similar to previous days, mid-level
lapse rates will be weak and considerable mid-level moisture will
limit overall severe concerns.  However, the strongest cells will be
capable of occasional gusty/damaging winds.

...MT...
Strong heating will occur this afternoon across much of
central/eastern MT, where deep boundary-layer mixing will lead to
inverted-v profiles.  Scattered thunderstorms are forecast to
develop along a corridor from southwest into central MT by late
afternoon.  These high-based storms may pose a risk of a few
damaging wind gusts.

Tropical Depression One-C Discussion Number   1
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 PM HST Sat Jul 26 2025

Deep convection has persisted over the area of low pressure well 
southeast of the Hawaiian Islands for the last 12 hours or so, with 
the latest satellite images showing improved organization and a 
better defined banding structure.  The latest subjective Dvorak 
current intensity estimates came in at 2.0/30 knots from PHFO, 
1.5/25 knots from SAB, and 1.0/25 knots from JTWC.  A recent 
27/0620Z Metop-B ASCAT pass showed a well-defined low-level 
circulation with a large swath of 25-knot winds and a few embedded 
25- to 30-knot wind barbs.  Given the improved structure and 
organization of the system, advisories are being initiated on the 
first tropical cyclone of the season in the central Pacific, 
Tropical Depression One-C.  The initial intensity will be set at 30 
knots.

Tropical Depression One-C is moving toward the west, or 270 degrees, 
at 10 knots.  This general westward motion is expected to continue 
over the next couple of days as the system moves along the southern 
periphery of a subtropical ridge to the north.  Beyond 48 hours, the 
forward speed is expected to increase considerably in response to a 
low- to mid-level ridge strengthening to the north of cyclone.  The 
track forecast closely follows a blend of the TVCE and HCCA 
consensus guidance.

The environment will remain conducive for intensification over the 
next couple of days, as One-C remains over warm waters between 28 
and 29C, with adequate mid-level moisture and light to moderate 
easterly shear.  As a result, the intensity forecast calls for 
steady strengthening during this time, with One-C becoming Tropical 
Storm Iona on Sunday.  Beyond 60 hours, the cyclone will begin to 
experience increasing westerly vertical wind shear while also 
entraining drier mid-level air.  This is expected to lead to steady 
weakening, with the system becoming a tropical depression again 
around day 5.  The intensity forecast is best aligned with the HCCA 
intensity consensus guidance.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0327 AM CDT Sun Jul 27 2025

Valid 301200Z - 041200Z

...DISCUSSION...
The general upper-level pattern over the next week will feature a
trough in the Northeast, a ridge over much of the southern U.S. and
Plains, and a weak trough off the West Coast. The Northeastern
trough will weaken with time, before moving out of the region around
next weekend.  Models eventually develop a shortwave trough in the
West, but this signal has been inconsistent in the past several
runs. At the surface, high pressure will build into the Great Lakes
and Northeast. This will progressively push a cold front farther
south and west with time.

While some severe risk is possible along the cold front, shear and
buoyancy will be diminished with each successive day. With the front
pushing modest moisture into the Rockies, convection is possible
each day next week. Strong to potentially severe storms may occur
with this activity, but weak shear beneath the upper ridge makes it
unclear where the most intense storms would be. Furthermore,
repeated days of convection will at some point adversely affect the
quality of the low-level airmass. Predictability remains too low for
highlights.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0132 AM CDT Sun Jul 27 2025

Valid 281200Z - 291200Z

...Synopsis...
A similar weather pattern is in store for the U.S. tomorrow
(Monday), with a mid-level trough expected to meander along the West
Coast as upper ridging prevails over the remainder of the CONUS.
Locally dry and breezy conditions are expected across portions of
the Four Corners into the central Rockies, though the lack of a
stronger surface wind field precludes Elevated highlights at this
time. Mid-level moisture ahead of the upper trough will support a
mix of wet and dry thunderstorms Sunday afternoon and evening over
far northern parts of the Great Basin into the Pacific Northwest.
Given dry fuels in place, isolated dry thunderstorm highlights have
been introduced.

Mesoscale Discussion 1793
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0350 PM CDT Sat Jul 26 2025

Areas affected...much of central into northern South Dakota into
southern North Dakota

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 262050Z - 262315Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Storms will increase over the next 1-2 hours over central
South Dakota, with further activity developing north/northeastward
into southern North Dakota. Damaging winds appear likely, with
locally large hail. Isolated significant gusts cannot be ruled out.

DISCUSSION...Visible imagery shows storms beginning to develop near
the surface low over south-central SD, in a very steep lapse rate
environment. The 18Z UNR soundings shows 9.5 C/km midlevel lapse
rates, and modest westerlies aloft. East of there, surface analysis
depicts MLCAPE in excess of 3000 J/kg, and a theta-e axis roughly
along the ND/SD border counties.

Given the observed TCU vigor over south-central SD currently, this
may be the initiation point for a larger-scale,
northward-propagating complex of storms depicted in some CAM
solutions. Otherwise, it is also possible outflow from high-based
storms coming out of WY into western NE may produce outflow aiding
further development as well.

Mesoscale Discussion 1792

0348 PM CDT Sat Jul 26 2025

Areas affected...Northeastern Colorado...western Nebraska

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 262048Z - 262145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm activity across the high terrain will move
eastward into the evening with potential for damaging winds.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorm activity has been steadily developing
across the high terrain in Colorado/Wyoming over the last couple of
hours. Dew points in these regions are low in the mid 40s, with
better moisture located across Nebraska into southern South Dakota.
CAM guidance suggests that activity will develop along eastward
moving outflow by late afternoon/evening. Downstream, temperatures
have warmed into the upper 90s to 100s, with dew point spreads
around 40-50 degrees. Though deep layer shear remains weak, large
dew point spreads and steep low to mid-level lapse rates may promote
some damaging wind potential. In addition, the low level jet is
progged to increase through the evening with the deepening of a
surface low across South Dakota. While watch issuance is not
anticipated, trends in this area will be monitored.

Valid 262000Z - 271200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE NORTHERN PLAINS AND MID-ATLANTIC...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms accompanied by damaging wind gusts are possible
this afternoon through tonight in parts of the northern
Plains. Isolated strong to severe storms will also be possible from
the Ohio Valley and lower Great Lakes into the Mid-Atlantic region,
and across the central High Plains and much of Montana.

...20Z Update...
The forecast remains on track, and only minor changes were made with
this update. The Marginal risk was expanded slightly eastward in
northern MN, where an ongoing cluster of storms (preceding a remnant
MCV) may pose a risk of strong/severe gusts through the afternoon.
For details on the near-term severe risks in the Mid-Atlantic and
Midwest, reference MCDs 1790/1791.

..Weinman.. 07/26/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1146 AM CDT Sat Jul 26 2025/

...Northern Plains...
Ahead of an upper low over northern California/western Nevada,
midday water vapor imagery reflects a lead shortwave trough moving
northeastward over northern Utah/eastern Idaho and western Wyoming.
In this regime, forcing for ascent and gradual cooling aloft will
occur through late today over northern Wyoming and southern/eastern
Montana. Northerly/upslope surface winds, combined with strong
heating and moderate CAPE values, will promote the development of
scattered high-based gusty thunderstorms by late afternoon. This
will initially occur across southern Montana and toward the Big
Horns/northeast Wyoming. Additional high-based storm development is
expected near the surface low and southward-extending surface trough
into the central High Plains. Storms that move into the western
Dakotas will encounter progressively higher CAPE and likely grow
upscale through the evening with a greater risk of organized severe
winds, aside from some continued hail potential. As least some
late-night severe risk will probably persist across North
Dakota/eastern South Dakota into Minnesota.

...Midwest to Mid-Atlantic States/Delmarva...
Multiple clusters of have persisted and/or reinvigorated early today
in a corridor spanning north-central Illinois/northern Indiana, as
well as central Pennsylvania. Moist/humid conditions will exist
south of the convectively reinforced boundary and away from areas of
persistent cloud debris (such as northward into Lower Michigan),
with a reservoir of ample buoyancy contributing to a diurnal
intensification of storms as multiple convectively enhanced
mid-level disturbances interface with the effective front and nearby
warm sector. The strongest storms will be capable of damaging winds,
and a somewhat more favorable corridor for severe thunderstorms/wind
damage appears to exist across the Mid-Atlantic States including
south/southeast parts of Pennsylvania toward the Delmarva/Chesapeake
Bay.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0215 PM CDT Sat Jul 26 2025

Valid 281200Z - 291200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS
OF MONTANA...THE DAKOTAS...IOWA...MINNESOTA...AND WISCONSIN...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are possible from the northern Rockies into the
Dakotas and Upper Midwest.

...Southeast Montana and the Dakotas to Wisconsin...

A couple of shortwave impulses are forecast to move eastward through
westerly flow aloft on Sunday. At the surface, low pressure is
forecast over SD, with a surface front expected to develop
south/southeast from southeast MT to the Mid-MO Valley into early
Monday. A very moist airmass will be in place ahead of the surface
low/front across SD into parts of MN/IA/WI. This will support a
broad area of strong to extreme instability. However, uncertainty
persists, and is mainly a result of how convection and a potential
MCS will develop in the Day 2/Sunday period and what impacts those
storms may have on the boundary layer across parts of the Upper
Midwest. 

Nevertheless, it appears likely isolated storms will develop near
the surface low and within the post-frontal regime from southeast MT
into the Black Hills vicinity. This activity will pose a risk of
mainly strong/severe gusts and perhaps some marginal hail. With
eastward extent across SD into MN/IA/WI, storms will likely form
along the southward-advancing front. Some guidance depicts a modest
low-level jet developing during the evening. Coupled with sufficient
effective shear, and strong instability, upscale growth into an MCS
is possible. Where this may occur is uncertain as previously
mentioned outflow from prior convection may result in lingering
inhibition. Some severe wind risk appears possible and the Marginal
risk (level 1 of 5) will be maintained, though higher probabilities
may be needed in subsequent outlooks.

...Central MT...

Isolated thunderstorms will develop over higher terrain during the
afternoon/evening as a shortwave trough migrates through the upper
ridge over the Pacific Northwest. Sufficient moisture will be in
place and relatively cool temperatures aloft will aid in MLCAPE
values approaching 1000 J/kg. Effective shear magnitudes around
25-30 kt will support occasionally organized cells. A deeply mixed
boundary layer will foster locally strong/damaging wind potential.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1232 PM CDT Sat Jul 26 2025

Valid 271200Z - 281200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS OF
MN...WI...AND UPPER MI...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are possible across the Upper Midwest, as well
as across portions of the Mid-Atlantic and New England region.

...Upper Midwest...

Uncertainty still exists for Sunday's forecast, driven by convection
in the Day 1/Saturday period persisting into parts of MN early in
the forecast period. However, forecast guidance is consistent in
bringing an upper shortwave trough across MN/WI/Upper MI, with 40-60
kt 500 mb westerly flow overspreading the region coincident with the
shortwave feature. At the surface, a very moist airmass will be in
place with dewpoints mostly in the 70s. This will support a corridor
of strong to extreme instability (MLCAPE 3000-5000 J/kg from western
SD into MN and portions of northern WI/Upper MI). 

A weak surface front/trough will develop east/southeast through the
period and may intersect outflow from morning activity. This should
focus thunderstorm develop/re-intensification as the airmass rapidly
destabilizes/recovers ahead of or in the wake of any lingering early
morning thunderstorm activity. While the spatial extent of greater
severe potential remains a bit uncertain, the best consistency
across multiple forecast models suggests severe/damaging wind
potential will be greater across parts of MN/northern WI and parts
of Upper MI. A Slight risk (level 2 of 5) has been included to
account for latest trends in guidance and an overall favorable
synoptic/mesoscale pattern for an organized line of convection
producing damaging gusts. Convection may persist downstream during
the evening/nighttime hours into IA/IL/southern WI, but uncertainty
is greater in these areas, so the Marginal risk (level 1 of 5) has
been maintained. 

...Mid-Atlantic Vicinity...

A couple of shortwave impulses are expected to move through
northwesterly flow aloft across the Mid-Atlantic vicinity Sunday
morning/afternoon. Deep shear will remain weak, with only around
15-25 kt northwesterly flow depicted in forecast soundings.
Nevertheless, a very moist airmass with dewpoints in the 70s and PW
values over 2 inches, will be in place across the region. This will
support strong instability in the 2000-3000 J/kg MLCAPE range. Where
strong heating occurs, steepening low-level lapse rates are noted in
forecast soundings. Thunderstorms are expected to develop over
higher terrain as a weak surface boundary sags southward. Additional
convection may develop along a surface trough across the VA/NC
Piedmont. Isolated strong/damaging gusts associated with wet
downbursts will be possible as storms develop south/southeast
through early evening.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1152 AM CDT Sat Jul 26 2025

Valid 261700Z - 271200Z

...17z Update...
The prior forecast remains valid with minor adjustments for the most
recent guidance. Scattered thunderstorms, with isolated dry strikes,
remain likely over portions of the northern Great Basin and northern
Rockies this afternoon/evening. The edges of the IsoDryT area have
been adjusted for recent heavier precipitation. Additional scattered
storms are possible into parts of southwestern MT supporting some
risk for lightning ignitions.

Across the eastern Great Basin and Western Slope, dry/breezy
conditions with RH below 15% and winds greater than 15 mph are
likely this afternoon and evening from UT/AZ into parts of CO/WY.
Minor adjustments were made to areas where recent rainfall has
limited fuel availability. Otherwise, see the prior discussion for
more information.

..Lyons.. 07/26/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0138 AM CDT Sat Jul 26 2025/

...Synopsis...
A broad upper trough will overspread much of the western U.S. while
upper ridging persists east of the Rockies today. Multiple embedded
mid-level impulses will traverse the northern Great Basin into the
northern Rockies during the afternoon, encouraging dry and breezy
conditions across parts of the Great Basin into the Four Corners
region, as well as thunderstorm development into the Pacific
Northwest.

By afternoon peak heating, southwesterly sustained surface winds
will reach 15-25 mph as RH dips to 10-20 percent across the eastern
Great Basin/Four Corners. Elevated highlights have been maintained
given the presence of dry fuels. Farther to the northwest, from
Northeast California to the Idaho/Montana border, adequate mid-level
moisture and deep-layer ascent will support isolated to scattered
thunderstorm development atop a dry boundary layer. High-based
thunderstorms will produce a mix of wet and dry strikes atop
receptive fuels, warranting the continuation of isolated dry
thunderstorm highlights.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1146 AM CDT Sat Jul 26 2025

Valid 261630Z - 271200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
NORTHERN PLAINS AND MID-ATLANTIC...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms accompanied by damaging wind gusts are possible
this afternoon through tonight in parts of the northern
Plains. Isolated strong to severe storms will also be possible from
the Ohio Valley and lower Great Lakes into the mid-Atlantic region,
and across the central High Plains and much of Montana.

...Northern Plains...
Ahead of an upper low over northern California/western Nevada,
midday water vapor imagery reflects a lead shortwave trough moving
northeastward over northern Utah/eastern Idaho and western Wyoming.
In this regime, forcing for ascent and gradual cooling aloft will
occur through late today over northern Wyoming and southern/eastern
Montana. Northerly/upslope surface winds, combined with strong
heating and moderate CAPE values, will promote the development of
scattered high-based gusty thunderstorms by late afternoon. This
will initially occur across southern Montana and toward the Big
Horns/northeast Wyoming. Additional high-based storm development is
expected near the surface low and southward-extending surface trough
into the central High Plains. Storms that move into the western
Dakotas will encounter progressively higher CAPE and likely grow
upscale through the evening with a greater risk of organized severe
winds, aside from some continued hail potential. As least some
late-night severe risk will probably persist across North
Dakota/eastern South Dakota into Minnesota.

...Midwest to Mid-Atlantic States/Delmarva...
Multiple clusters of have persisted and/or reinvigorated early today
in a corridor spanning north-central Illinois/northern Indiana, as
well as central Pennsylvania. Moist/humid conditions will exist
south of the convectively reinforced boundary and away from areas of
persistent cloud debris (such as northward into Lower Michigan),
with a reservoir of ample buoyancy contributing to a diurnal
intensification of storms as multiple convectively enhanced
mid-level disturbances interface with the effective front and nearby
warm sector. The strongest storms will be capable of damaging winds,
and a somewhat more favorable corridor for severe thunderstorms/wind
damage appears to exist across the Mid-Atlantic States including
south/southeast parts of Pennsylvania toward the Delmarva/Chesapeake
Bay.

0329 PM CDT Fri Jul 25 2025

Areas affected...eastern Pennsylvania...New Jersey...Long Island

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 542...

Valid 252029Z - 252200Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 542
continues.

SUMMARY...Potential for localized severe gusts remains across the
watch area.

DISCUSSION...Cluster of storms currently extend from coastal MA/RI
across Long Island and into eastern PA, with generally fast movement
to the southeast. A few storms have clearly reached severe levels,
with a 55 kt gust recently measured at Newark Airport. Additional
severe gusts may occur across the remainder of the warm sector over
land from southeast PA into much of NJ and across parts of Long
Island. Little to no additional severe storms are expected behind
the initial activity as due to drying aloft.

Mesoscale Discussion 1778
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0309 PM CDT Fri Jul 25 2025

Areas affected...portions of eastern Kansas and northwestern
Missouri

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 252009Z - 252215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...A few damaging gusts and a few brief tornadoes are
possible this afternoon across parts of eastern Kansas and
northwestern Missouri. A watch may be needed.

DISCUSSION...An MCV is currently situated over north central Kansas,
with an outflow/differential heating boundary across parts of
southeastern Kansas. Due to daytime heating, particularly south of
the boundary, along with surface dewpoints generally in the low to
mid 70s F, inhibition has been removed across the region. There is
some enhanced flow aloft round the MCV, which has provided ~30 kts
of effective bulk shear. Low-level shear is generally fairly weak,
though there is some enhancement in the weak easterly flow north of
the differential heating boundary. Given modest deep-layer shear,
multicell clusters with transient supercells are possible through
the afternoon, and any supercells would carry a risk of a brief
tornado, particularly where low-level shear is locally enhanced.
However, overall weak low-level flow and poor lapse rates may limit
the tornado threat. In addition, the atmosphere is quite moist, and
the water loading in downdrafts may lead to a risk for damaging
gusts as cell cluster with time. Trends are being monitored for a
possible watch.

Mesoscale Discussion 1773

0308 PM CDT Thu Jul 24 2025

Areas affected...portions of eastern KS into northwest MO

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 242008Z - 242215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated strong wind gusts are possible the remainder of
the afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorms have gradually increased in intensity
this afternoon amid a very moist and moderately unstable airmass.
Vertical shear will remain modest, with effective shear magnitude
only expected to be around 20 kt. Nevertheless, strong instability
and high PW values near 2 inches could support isolated wet
microbursts within this weakly sheared environment. North and east
extent of strong/severe potential may remain somewhat limited due to
early day convection and lingering cloud cover across northern MO.
Weak inhibition remains over this area and instability is somewhat
less. At this time, the overall threat appears limited/transient and
a severe thunderstorm watch is not currently expected.

Areas affected...parts of eastern Wyoming and northern Colorado

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 241941Z - 242145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Storms may produce a few instance of large hail and a few
severe gusts across portions of eastern Wyoming and northern
Colorado. A watch is not anticipated.

DISCUSSION...Convection has developed along the mountains across
parts of eastern Wyoming and northern Colorado, where diurnal
inhibition has eroded. Farther east across the High Plains, some
inhibition remains for mixed-layer parcels, but additional heating
should continue to erode the MLCINH as the afternoon progresses.
Kinematically, the region is on the southern periphery of a modest
mid-level jet. This should provide sufficient shear for at least
transient supercells, and in some places low-level wind profiles
favor left-moving supercells. Given the long hodographs and steep
lapse rates with low freezing levels, some hail is possible with the
strongest storms. Shear decreases with southward extent, so this may
put a limit on the southern extent of the hail risk. With time,
storms may begin to cluster, and these clusters may also produce a
risk for severe gusts given the relatively dry boundary layer and
steep low-level lapse rates. Given the expected sparse coverage of
severe weather, a watch is not anticipated.

Areas affected...portions of northern IL/IN into southern Lower MI

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 241910Z - 242115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated strong to severe wind gusts are possible this
afternoon into early evening across portions of northeast Illinois,
northern Indiana, and southern Lower Michigan.

DISCUSSION...Isolated thunderstorms are developing across northeast
IL as of 19z ahead of surface boundary moving slowly southeastward.
Ahead of the boundary and initial thunderstorm development, strong
heating into the low 90s, with dewpoints in the mid/upper 70s, is
resulting in a corridor of moderate/strong instability (MLCAPE up to
3000 J/kg). Deep shear will remain weak across the region, but
effective shear magnitudes around 20-30 kt may be sufficient for a
few organized cells/clusters. Modified RAP forecast soundings show
large instability, with steep low-level lapse rates from 7-8 C/km in
the 0-3 km layer. Given the very moist and strongly unstable
airmass, isolated downbursts producing strong to severe gusts are
possible through the afternoon into early evening. 

Some uncertainty remains regarding storm coverage, especially given
veering low-level flow, reducing convergence/lift along the surface
boundary. Nevertheless, any storm that does develop could produce
locally damaging gusts. A severe thunderstorm watch may be needed at
some point this afternoon.

Areas affected...parts of northeastern Colorado...southeast
Wyoming...and far western Nebraska

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 232043Z - 232245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Storms may produce a few severe gusts and some marginally
severe hail across parts of northeastern Colorado, southeast
Wyoming, and far western Nebraska this afternoon. A watch is not
anticipated.

DISCUSSION...Mid-level clouds from morning convection have been slow
to clear portions of northeastern Colorado, and so heating has been
delayed, which has led to some residual inhibition. Despite this, a
narrow corridor of heating along the mountains has allowed storms to
percolate along the Front Range this afternoon in a post-frontal
upslope flow regime. These storms are well south of the strongest
mid-level flow, and therefore deep-layer shear is relatively weak.
Because of this, multicell clusters are expected to be the dominant
storm mode. In addition, the environment has some mid-level dry air
and steep lapse rates, which may lead to a threat for severe gusts
with the strongest clusters. Some hail is possible with these storms
given low freezing levels, but the lack of deep-layer shear and the
multicell storm mode may limit the severe hail risk with these
storms.

0254 PM CDT Wed Jul 23 2025

Areas affected...portions of southeast MN into north-central WI

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 231954Z - 232200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Intensifying thunderstorms may pose a risk of damaging
wind gusts across southeast Minnesota into portions of
northern/central Wisconsin the next few hours. Area is being
monitored for possible watch issuance.

DISCUSSION...Isolated to scattered thunderstorms are
developing/intensifying this afternoon along/just ahead of the
southward-advancing cold front. This activity is tracking along a
differential heating zone and within the strong instability gradient
oriented across north-central WI. Strong heating ahead of these
storms and dewpoints in the mid 70s have allowed inhibition to
weaken. This area is on the edges of more favorable deep shear, but
20-30 kt effective shear magnitudes may be sufficient for organized
clusters/small bows given strong instability. Modified RAP forecast
soundings and regional VWP data show somewhat small but favorably
curved low-level hodographs. Low-level shear will remain modest, but
given the very moist and unstable boundary layer, a tornado or two
also could occur, in addition to damaging wind gusts. This area is
being monitored for possible watch issuance.

Mesoscale Discussion 1762
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0211 PM CDT Wed Jul 23 2025

Areas affected...parts of eastern Wyoming...southeastern Montana.
western South Dakota...and far northwestern Nebraska

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 231911Z - 232115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Storms with a risk of large hail and severe gusts are
possible this afternoon across portions of eastern Wyoming,
southeastern Montana, western South Dakota, and northwestern
Nebraska. A watch may be needed to cover this threat.

DISCUSSION...Storms are developing in a post-frontal upslope flow
regime in northern and eastern Wyoming. These storms are situated on
the southern periphery of a modest mid-level jet. This flow should
provide sufficient deep-layer shear for a supercell storm mode, and
given the relatively straight hodographs and lower freezing levels,
some severe hail is possible initially with these storms. The
deep-layer shear decreases markedly with southward extent, so this
may put a limit on the southern extent of the hail risk.

Given relatively high boundary layer humidity, cold pools may be
weaker, and therefore upscale growth may be slow to occur. However,
some clustering of storms is expected with time. This would
transition the primary threat to severe gusts given the relatively
steep low-level lapse rates and modest flow aloft on the regional
RAP short-term forecast profiles.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 538
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
135 PM MDT Wed Jul 23 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Western South Dakota
  Central into Northeast Wyoming

* Effective this Wednesday afternoon and evening from 135 PM
  until 800 PM MDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2
    inches in diameter possible
  Isolated damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...Widely scattered to scattered thunderstorms are forecast
to develop this afternoon.  The stronger storms will likely become
supercells and pose a risk for large hail (1 to 2 inches in
diameter).  Isolated severe gusts (60-70 mph) are possible with
supercells and with storms that may congeal into a linear cluster
towards the evening.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 90
statute miles east and west of a line from 50 miles north northeast
of Gillette WY to 30 miles east southeast of Douglas WY. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU8).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 450. Mean storm motion vector
27020.

Mesoscale Discussion 1759
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0728 AM CDT Wed Jul 23 2025

Areas affected...eastern SD and western MN

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 231228Z - 231400Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Sporadic severe gusts may persist this morning with
multiple messy clusters across eastern South Dakota. Watch issuance
in the near-term is uncertain with increasing likelihood towards
midday.

DISCUSSION...A small but persistent cluster that has produced a
focused swath of measured severe gusts across southwest into central
SD has weakened in terms of reflectivity structure and IR cloud top
warming. The downstream front has oscillated southward, suggesting
that this cluster will persist to the cool side of this front and
likely impinge on weak downstream convection towards the SD/ND/MN
border area. Meanwhile, a west/east-oriented convective band
emanating northward across southern SD has produced a couple
measured severe gusts at mesonet sites. This convection will
probably evolve more northeastward into late morning and could also
congeal with the post-frontal convection to the north. Overall messy
and complex convective mode, along with the time of day, suggests
that severe potential may remain sporadic and disorganized. More
positive cold pool merging could occur into western MN towards
midday as greater downstream insolation occurs across
central/southern MN.

Mesoscale Discussion 1756
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0319 PM CDT Tue Jul 22 2025

Areas affected...portions of southeast North Dakota and northeast
South Dakota

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 222019Z - 222215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Strong to severe thunderstorms are possible into early
evening. Hail and strong gusts may occur with stronger storms.

DISCUSSION...Scattered thunderstorms have developed this afternoon
within the post-outflow airmass. While early day convection and
cloud cover have impacted the airmass to some degree, some recovery
is apparent as temperatures have warmed into the upper 70s to low
80s and dewpoints have been maintained in the upper 60s to low 70s.
As a result, capping is eroding, and MLCAPE has increased to
1000-2000 J/kg. Ongoing storms may be somewhat elevated initially,
but could become surface-based with time. Effective shear magnitudes
greater than 40 kt and steep midlevel lapse rates suggests robust
updrafts supporting isolated large hail and strong/severe gusts will
be possible. Given the influence of outflow and modification of the
airmass from morning convection, convective evolution remains
somewhat uncertain. Portions of the area may eventually need a
severe thunderstorm watch, but timing and location is uncertain.

Areas affected...northern WY into southeast MT

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 222000Z - 222200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated strong to severe thunderstorms are possible
across parts of southern Montana and northern Wyoming this afternoon
and evening.

DISCUSSION...Occasionally robust thunderstorms have developed over
higher terrain in portions of southern MT and northern WY. Weak
inhibition remains downstream over the adjacent high Plains, but
additional heating and increasing ascent should allow for storms to
become sustained further from the terrain with time into late
afternoon. Regional VWP data shows elongated, straight hodographs
amid steep midlevel lapse rates. While instability is muted due to
the drier, post-frontal low-level airmass, MLCAPE will still be
sufficient to sustain updrafts. Isolated strong to severe
thunderstorms posing a risk for hail (possibly up to 2 inches,
especially over far southeast MT) will be possible over the next
several hours. Trends will be monitored and a severe thunderstorm
watch may be needed for parts of the discussion area later this
afternoon.

Mesoscale Discussion 1738
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0241 PM CDT Sun Jul 20 2025

Areas affected...south-central South Dakota across western Nebraska
and toward northwest Kansas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 201941Z - 202215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered severe storms appear likely later this afternoon
from south-central SD across west-central NE and toward northwest
KS. A few cells may produce large hail, with locally damaging gusts.
A tornado is possible over southern SD into far northern NE after
23Z. A portion of the area may require a watch.

DISCUSSION...Surface map shows low pressure extending from southwest
SD across western NE and into the CO/KS border area, with strong
heating. This trough will continue to deepen, and sufficient
convergence within the uncapped air mass should allow for widely
scattered storms to develop late this afternoon.

Of particular note is the warm front area which currently curls
northwestward out of northern NE and into south-central SD. Here,
heating is occurring on the cool side of the boundary, where
dewpoints remain above 70 F and low-level shear is enhanced. Any
supercell that develops here, most likely after 23Z, could be
tornadic at times, and produce very large hail as it proceeds
southeastward, aided by a modest evening low-level jet.

Farther south into the deeper/heated air mass, higher based storms
are expected, and overall shear is weaker as well. However, steep
lapse rates will favor locally severe gusts, and even some hail in
the early and robust formation stages.

Mesoscale Discussion 1737

Areas affected...southern Indiana and Ohio...northern Kentucky

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 201835Z - 202130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...A few strong storms producing locally damaging gusts
cannot be ruled out later this afternoon from southern Indiana
across southern Ohio and northeast Kentucky.

DISCUSSION...An MCV continues to move rapidly eastward across
northern IN, well north of a stalled front draped across southern
IL/IN and southwest OH. Meanwhile, a very moist air mass remains
near this boundary, with heating occurring upstream across the Mid
MS and OH Valleys.

While the entire warm sector is unstable, areas near the front exist
beneath slightly stronger deep-layer mean winds, on the southern
periphery of the larger scale trough (and MCV) influence.

Visible imagery show increasing CU fields from southern IN into
northern and eastern KY, and scattered storms are likely within this
zone. Locally strong downbursts will be possible, but any more
substantial wind threat would be conditional on a large cluster of
storms producing outflow, and tracking east/southeast near the
boundary. At this time, it appears a watch will not be necessary.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 530
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
410 PM EDT Sun Jul 20 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Connecticut
  Massachusetts
  Far Southern Maine
  Southern New Hampshire
  Rhode Island
  Southern Vermont
  Coastal Waters

* Effective this Sunday afternoon and evening from 410 PM until
  900 PM EDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 65 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1 inch in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Scattered thunderstorms are forecast to continue to
develop and intensify and pose primarily a threat for strong to
severe gusts (55-65 mph).  Isolated large hail may accompany the
stronger cells.  This activity will likely reach the coast by the
mid evening.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 80
statute miles north and south of a line from 30 miles east northeast
of Boston MA to 25 miles south southwest of Pittsfield MA. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU0).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
1 inch. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 55 knots. A few
cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 400. Mean storm motion vector
28025.

Mesoscale Discussion 1735
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0735 AM CDT Sun Jul 20 2025

Areas affected...Portions of far east-central IL into central IN

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 201235Z - 201430Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...A small complex of thunderstorms may pose a gradually
increasing threat for damaging winds over the next few hours. Watch
issuance is possible later this morning if this activity can
intensify.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorms are ongoing this morning across parts of
central IL, aided by modest west-southwesterly low-level warm
advection and a low-amplitude mid-level perturbation. This
convection should continue to track generally east-southeastward
this morning across parts of central IN along an instability
gradient evident in latest mesoanalysis. While low/mid-level flow is
not overly strong, recent VWPs from KILX/KIND do show some
strengthening with height through mid levels. Resultant 25-30 kt of
effective bulk shear should continue to support some updraft
organization, with a recent supercell structure noted with a
thunderstorm near the IL/IN border. If a small bowing cluster can
become established as some recent high-resolution guidance suggests,
then a greater threat for scattered severe/damaging winds may be
realized across parts of central IN later this morning as the
boundary layer gradually destabilizes with filtered daytime heating.
While not immediately likely, Severe Thunderstorm Watch issuance may
eventually be needed if the ongoing activity can intensify.
