Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
Issued by 15th OWS Scott Air Force Base IL
1110 AM CST Thu Dec 07 2023

Valid 081200Z - 091200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS NORTHEAST
TX TO AR AND SOUTHERN MO...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe hail will be possible late night Friday from
northeast Texas and southeast Oklahoma through central Arkansas and
southwest Missouri.

...Synopsis...
Guidance has clearly trended over the past 36 hours to multiple
distinct shortwave impulses ejecting within the broad upper trough
over the western and central states. The lead impulse in the Four
Corners area at 12Z Friday will amplify across the central Great
Plains towards the Mid-MS Valley. Meanwhile, a secondary impulse and
attendant speed max will hold back within the basal portion of the
broad trough over the Four Corners. The net result will be more
prominent surface cyclogenesis occurring ahead of the lead wave,
mainly on Friday night across the Lower MO Valley towards southern
Lake MI. A surface cold front will sweep more rapidly east in
vicinity of the cyclone track, and slow its southeast push across
the southeast OK/Ark-La-Tex area late in the period.

...Northeast TX to AR/Southern MO...
The aforementioned synoptic trends suggest that forcing for ascent
appears to be limited across the modifying warm sector from east TX
towards the Ozarks on Friday night. Timing of the wave ejections
indicate near-neutral mid-level height change is anticipated
overnight in this region. With substantial modification necessary of
the continental polar air mass that is across the northwest Gulf
coast, more than meager surface-based instability will likely
struggle to advect north to/beyond the Ozarks. Within a
southwesterly low to mid-level flow regime, moderate MLCIN and low
RH above the capping inversion suggest that warm-sector thunderstorm
initiation ahead of the cold front is unlikely through 12Z Saturday.
Low-level warm theta-e advection could still be adequate for
isolated slightly elevated thunderstorms centered on the southeast
OK/Ark-La-Tex region deeper into AR overnight, with a primary threat
of localized severe hail.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1227 AM CST Thu Dec 07 2023/

...Synopsis...
A belt of strong mid-level westerly flow will move across the
Rockies today which will result in development of a surface cyclone
across central Plains late in the period. Dry and warm westerly
downslope flow will increase across portions of the Southern Plains.
Afternoon relative humidity reductions to around 15 percent will
overlap sustained winds at 15-20 mph across portions of eastern New
Mexico into the Texas and Oklahoma Panhandles and extending as far
north as the southeast plains of Colorado. Fuels within this region
are largely near normal moisture and only marginally receptive to
spread. Locally Elevated fire weather conditions will be possible in
areas where fine fuels have cured and become dormant.

Valid 071630Z - 081200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected through tonight.

...Synopsis/Discussion...
The mid/upper-level pattern will evolve toward a progressive,
high-amplitude western CONUS trough through the period, as
associated increasingly cyclonic flow is traversed by a series of
shortwaves.  Accompanying cold midlevel air (-20 to -34 deg C)
500-mb temperatures will spread eastward/inland across a vast
section of the northwestern CONUS through the period, from the
northern Great Basin northward, and the central/northern Rockies
westward.  Mesobeta-scale shots of localized, enhanced large-scale
lift, where moving atop pockets of marginally favorable low/middle-
level moisture, may prompt transient bursts of shallow cells with
very isolated/brief thunder potential, almost anywhere in that
swath. 

However, the most favorable areas for 10% or greater thunderstorm
coverage appears to be 1) near-coastal Northwest from northern CA to
WA, from portions of the Cascades westward, where the coldest air
aloft will overlie the greatest low-level moisture content near its
Pacific source, and 2) eastern OR/southwestern ID and vicinity.  A
strong shortwave trough now nearing the coast has contributed to
some lightning offshore and near coastal southwestern OR the last
few hours, and that potential should continue and shift inland
through the remainder of the morning and afternoon.  Another round
of potential this evening may accompany a field of ascent preceding
a perturbation now well west of Vancouver Island, and progged to dig
southeastward toward the northern OR Coast.

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated lightning flashes remain possible across portions of the
northern Pacific Coastal region tonight.

...01z Update...

Early-evening water-vapor imagery depicts a lead short-wave trough
ejecting inland across northern CA, arcing northwest off the OR/WA
Coasts. Isolated flashes of lightning have been noted immediately
ahead of the short wave, and primarily offshore, west of OR.
Profiles will cool/steepen overnight as 500mb temperatures lower to
-30C across western OR/WA, with values at least -20C north of the
jet over northern CA. As a result, weak buoyancy will continue to
favor some risk for isolated thunderstorms.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0343 PM CST Wed Dec 06 2023

Valid 081200Z - 141200Z

A strong mid-level jet streak will cross nrthern California tomorrow
and carve out a large trough across the southern Plains on Friday.
This trough will become neutrally tilted across the eastern CONUS
before eventually becoming negatively tilted across the Northeast.
In the wake of this mid-level trough, a strong cold front will bring
a continental polar airmass across much of the United States. 

...Day 3/Fri Southwest into Far West Texas...
Dry and windy conditions are expected across southern New Mexico and
Far West Texas on Friday. A weak lee cyclone may lead to some
tightening pressure gradient. However, strong winds will primarily
be driven by a moderate to strong mid-level jet overspreading a
deeply mixed airmass with stronger winds reaching the surface. In
addition, 10 to 15F above normal temperatures will lead to relative
humidity in the teens and further support some fire weather threat.
ERC values remain near seasonable normals, but dormant, fine fuels
continue to cure and may support some fire spread and an increase in
initial attack. 

Some dry and breezy conditions are also possible on Day4/Sat in
portions of the TX/OK Panhandle and vicinity. However, these
conditions are expected in the post-frontal airmass where
temperatures will be cool and therefore, fire weather concerns
should be reduced. 

A weak mid-level shortwave trough embedded in the northwesterly flow
across the Central Rockies may result in some weak cyclogenesis on
Sunday across the central Plains. This may cause some dry and breezy
conditions across the southern High Plains. However, confidence in
stronger wind speeds is not high enough to necessitate probabilities
at this time.

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are unlikely through tonight.

...20Z Update...
The primary change with this update was removing the General
Thunderstorm area over Idaho and Montana. Most short-range guidance
depicts very minimal instability over the area, and any thunderstorm
activity should remain very isolated. Elsewhere, the forecast
remains on track.

..Weinman/Leitman.. 12/06/2023

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1027 AM CST Wed Dec 06 2023/

...Western OR and northern CA...
A strong upper trough is approaching the coast of northern CA and
southwest OR, with the associated surface cold front moving ashore
in the next couple of hours.  Strong onshore flow, lift in vicinity
of the front, and cold temperatures aloft may result in isolated
lightning flashes this afternoon along the coastal ranges and
interior mountains of northern CA/western OR.  Present indications
are that this activity will be quite sparse.

...ID/MT...
Later tonight, the aforementioned shortwave trough will track inland
and affect portions of ID/MT.  Steep mid-level lapse rates and
continued strong large scale lift will result in convective showers
over the mountains of central ID into western MT.  Profiles will be
quite cold, but pockets of weak instability may be sufficient for a
few lightning flashes - mainly after midnight.

...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorm areas are not expected through early Wednesday morning.

...Synopsis/Discussion...
In mid/upper levels, a progressive and fairly well-amplified
synoptic pattern will carry through the period, led by a strong
trough moving across the eastern CONUS, and ridging over the Rockies
and High Plains.  A strong shortwave trough -- apparent in moisture-
channel imagery over portions of WI/IL/MO -- will move eastward
across the Appalachians tonight and through the larger-scale trough.
Smaller shortwaves will move from northwestern ON across the Upper
Great Lakes, and separately, southeastward rapidly from the northern
Plains to the Ozarks and portions of the Southeast.  Late this
afternoon into evening, enough cooling aloft and residual low-level
moisture will be in place to support around 100 J/kg MUCAPE ahead of
the leading perturbation, in a corridor from southern OH to eastern
TN.  However, forecast soundings suggest buoyancy will remain below
an optimal icing layer for lightning, though a rogue strike or two
cannot be ruled out. 

Otherwise, a long-fetch, warm-advection conveyor ahead of the next
Pacific trough will settle southward down the Northwest Coast,
reaching northwesternmost CA around the end of the period.  Lapse
rates in this plume should remain too weak to support areas of
thunderstorms.
