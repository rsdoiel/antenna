URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 627
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1055 AM CDT Fri Aug 16 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Southwest and south central Kansas

* Effective this Friday morning and afternoon from 1055 AM until
  400 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2.5
    inches in diameter likely
  Scattered damaging winds likely with isolated significant gusts
    to 75 mph possible

SUMMARY...Elevated supercells may persist into the afternoon and
become rooted at the surface while moving southeastward.  The more
intense storms will be capable of producing hail up to 2.5 inches in
diameter and severe outflow gusts up to 75 mph.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 55
statute miles north and south of a line from 15 miles west of Dodge
City KS to 20 miles east northeast of Wichita KS. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU7).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 65 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 550. Mean storm motion vector
30030.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1229 PM CDT Fri Aug 16 2024

Valid 171200Z - 181200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS IN PARTS OF KY/OH
VALLEY AND THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are possible in parts of Kentucky and
the Ohio Valley on Saturday afternoon through about dusk. Damaging
winds and hail are the primary threats. Isolated to scattered severe
wind and hail are also possible across parts of western Oregon into
southwest Washington on Saturday afternoon through about dusk.

...Lower Great Lakes to the Mid/Deep South...
A slow-moving mid/upper trough should continue east across the
Great Lakes through early Sunday. An occluded surface cyclone over
Lower MI should drift into Lake Huron. A weak cold front will arc to
the south-southwest over the Upper OH Valley and trail southwest to
west across the Mid-South into OK. Along this baroclinic zone,
ongoing convection at 12Z Saturday appears most probable over the
Ozarks vicinity. It is plausible this activity may intensify as
downstream diurnal destabilization occurs in the Mid to Deep South.
Within the mid-level flow gradient, semi-organized clusters are
possible with a threat for sporadic damaging winds.

The belt of seasonably strong mid to upper-level westerlies should
be centered across KY/TN within the basal portion of the Great Lakes
trough. Consensus of guidance suggests 700-mb westerlies will be
stronger relative to Friday, likely centered on the OH Valley
region. With the more prominent diurnal destabilization occurring
across KY into the OH Valley, away from the influence of Ozarks to
Deep South earlier-day convection, this setup may yield a greater
concentration of damaging winds and some severe hail along this
portion of the front. Despite the predominately westerly flow
regime, deep-layer speed shear should support a mix of multicell
clusters and semi-discrete, transient supercell structures. Multiple
convective rounds are possible during the afternoon into the early
to mid evening.

...Pacific Northwest...
A vigorous shortwave impulse, embedded within a broader mid/upper
trough, should move inland across northern CA into western OR. This
feature may take on a negative-tilt, with pronounced mid-level
height falls favorably timed to peak diurnal heating. A
strengthening mid to upper jetlet will overspread this region with
mid-level winds backing to the south-southeast. Within the exit
region of this meridional flow regime, scattered to numerous
late-afternoon and evening thunderstorms should be focused from
south to north across the Cascade Range. While buoyancy should
remain weak, steep mid to low-level lapse rates should support a few
supercells capable of both severe hail and wind. The wind threat may
be relatively greater across parts of the Columbia Valley near the
OR/WA border area as storms cluster into the early evening.

...Eastern Great Basin...
A plume of richer 700-mb moisture will advect north from AZ, with
peripheral flow enhancement from the West Coast shortwave trough.
Guidance is fairly consistent that late morning to midday
thunderstorm activity will increase as diurnal destabilization
ensues. While this may not be favorably timed with peak heating, the
steep lapse-rate environment and moderate deep-layer flow suggest a
threat for strong to sporadic severe gusts and small hail. A later
round of late afternoon to early evening thunderstorms may occur
along the western periphery of this earlier day activity, with a
similar threat for low-probability severe.

...Central and northern High Plains...
Mid-level ridging is expected across this region between the Great
Lakes and West Coast trough, but with moderate mid to upper-level
westerlies. Very isolated thunderstorms are possible during the late
afternoon to early evening along portions of a lee surface trough.
These appear most probable along the northwest periphery of the
central Great Plains to Ozarks buoyancy plume, in vicinity of
northwest KS, and separately near the Canadian border as a minor
shortwave impulse crests the ridge in the southern Prairie
Provinces. Deep-layer shear will be adequate for a couple supercells
capable of very isolated severe hail and wind.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1154 AM CDT Fri Aug 16 2024

Valid 161700Z - 171200Z

...Update...
In addition to the potential for isolated dry thunderstorms across
WY and MT, isolated dry lightning strikes may also occur over
central and southern NM this afternoon and evening. The latest
forecast soundings suggest a deeply mixed boundary layer will be in
place under a shallow plume of mid-level moisture within an
upper-level ridge, and orographic ascent should result in at least
isolated moist convection developing with daytime heating. Although
widespread fuels are not overly receptive across this region due to
recent rainfall, pockets of seasonably high ERCs persist. For the
rest of the CONUS, the previous forecast remains accurate and
unchanged. Please see the past discussion below for additional
details pertaining to NV and CA.

..Barnes.. 08/16/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0103 AM CDT Fri Aug 16 2024/

...Synopsis...
Broad, west-southwesterly mid-level flow will overspread portions of
California and northern Nevada today, with a modest jet streak (with
40-45 kt winds) progressing east across the northern Great Basin. As
this weak jet moves east, elevated fire-weather conditions are
expected across portions of California and Nevada. 

...Dry/Windy...
South of this mid-level jet and north of a mid-level ridge centered
over portions of Arizona and New Mexico, deep boundary layer mixing
will result in dry and windy conditions across portions of
California, Nevada, and Utah. Surface winds of 20-25 MPH and
relative humidity values of 5-10% are expected, though will only
overlap narrowly with a belt of receptive fuels across portions of
Nevada and California. With winds and relative humidity being
supportive of wildfire spread, but only modest fuel receptiveness,
highlights have been limited to elevated conditions at this time.
Recent wetting rainfall in eastern Nevada and western Utah will
limit wildfire potential in these areas, though additional drying of
fuels is expected given the dry/windy conditions. 

...Dry Thunderstorms...
The potential for some dry thunderstorms exists across portions of
northern Wyoming and southeastern Montana. However, recent wetting
rainfall and fuels guidance suggests there is minimal risk for
wildfire spread and lightning-based ignitions at this time.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1126 AM CDT Fri Aug 16 2024

Valid 161630Z - 171200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON
INTO EARLY TONIGHT FOR SOUTHERN KS...NORTHERN OK AND NORTHWEST AR...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are possible for central/southern
Kansas into northern Oklahoma and into northwest Arkansas.  Very
large hail up to 2.5 inches in diameter and severe gusts up to 75
mph are the expected hazards with the stronger thunderstorms.

...KS into OK through tonight...
Elevated thunderstorms have formed/strengthened since 14-15z from
west central into southwest KS in a zone of low-midlevel warm
advection downstream from an embedded speed max aloft.  There is
still some uncertainty regarding the longevity of these morning
storms.  However, if the ongoing storms persist into early-mid
afternoon when surface temperatures warm into the 90s F, convective
inhibition will diminish and the storms will become fully rooted at
the surface.  Given the conditionally favorable thermodynamic
(MLCAPE >2000 J/kg) and vertical shear (effective bulk shear in
excess of 40 kt) environment expected across southern KS/northern OK
by this afternoon, will maintain the SLGT risk for large hail up to
2.5 inches in diameter and severe outflow gusts up to 75 mph. 

...TN/OH Valleys this afternoon/evening...
A closed midlevel low will move generally eastward over WI/MI
through Saturday morning, as embedded perturbations rotate around
the southern periphery of the low.  Elevated convection has been
slowly weakening through the morning across KY/southern OH, with
other storms located farther southwest into western TN.  This
convection farther south will have more direct access to the
moist/unstable warm sector, and there will be some potential for an
increase in both storm coverage and intensity this afternoon from
middle/eastern TN into northern AL/northwest GA.  Occasional
downbursts with wind damage will be the main concern with multicell
clusters, given the relatively weak deep-layer flow/shear.

...WI to Lower MI this afternoon into early tonight...
Scattered thunderstorms are expected to form across WI this
afternoon and spread eastward into early tonight, along and ahead of
a surface cold front, and in advance of the midlevel closed low. 
Moisture/buoyancy will be sufficient for strong storms capable of
producing isolated large hail near 1 inch and isolated wind damage,
but modest vertical shear suggests primarily multicell storms.

Valid 151300Z - 161200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR PORTIONS OF
THE OZARKS...LOWER MISSOURI VALLEY...AND ILLINOIS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are possible across parts of the
Midwest through tonight.  Severe gusts capable of wind damage and
large hail are the primary risks with the stronger thunderstorms.

...Central Plains to the Mid Mississippi Valley...
Morning water-vapor imagery shows a series of embedded disturbances
rotating through a larger-scale trough centered over the northern
Great Plains.  A notable shortwave trough is located near the
WY/NE/SD vicinity and this feature will move east reaching the Upper
Great Lakes by Friday morning.  A lead convectively augmented
disturbance is moving east across the mid MS Valley this morning,
and it will move east into the southern Great Lakes and weaken
during the day.  Broken bands of showers/thunderstorms associated
with this lead impulse will progress east this morning and move into
a less unstable airmass across the Wabash Valley.  Some rejuvenation
of storms is possible later today on the southern portion of the
trailing outflow near the MS-OH River confluence westward into the
Ozarks.  Appreciable uncertainty exists at this time on the
intensity/coverage of storms in the aforementioned corridor. 
Nonetheless, heating of a moist airmass will potentially yield an
environment favorable for at least isolated to widely scattered
storms capable of a wind/hail threat.  

In wake of the early day cloud debris and overnight storm activity,
strong boundary-layer heating is expected across much of the Plains
into portions of the mid MS Valley.  As a result, strong buoyancy
will develop along the eastern edge of this steeper lapse-rate
plume.  Model guidance suggests very strong instability (MLCAPE
>3000 J/kg) will probably develop by mid-late afternoon from
portions of eastern KS/MO into southern IA.  Thunderstorms may focus
along a synoptic front that will arc from southeast MN-eastern
IA-northern MO-southeast KS-northern OK by late afternoon.  Some
guidance (i.e., 00Z MPAS and recent HRRR runs) indicates lower storm
coverage until later this evening across the lower MO Valley/mid MS
Valley portion of the Slight Risk.  Regardless, deep-layer shear
should be adequate for supercells and organized clusters and
wind/hail can be expected with the most robust updrafts.  High-based
thunderstorms are also expected to develop along the trailing
boundary into the southern Plains where surface temperatures will
easily rise through the upper 90s to near 100F.  The stronger
evaporatively cooled downdrafts will potentially result in severe
gusts before this activity diminishes by mid-late evening.  

...New England...
Upper troughing will hold across New England today with cool
mid-level temperatures and modest northerly flow at 500mb. Strong
boundary-layer heating will allow convective temperatures to be
breached by 19z and scattered convection is expected to develop
within a sheared environment that favors robust multi-cell updrafts.
Some of this activity could generate strong gusts and marginally
severe hail.  Convection will be diurnally driven and should weaken
with loss of daytime heating.

...Northern Rockies...
A mid- to upper-level trough over the Pacific Northwest will
gradually move northeast impinging on the northern Rockies by
afternoon.  The favorable timing of large-scale ascent and diurnal
destabilization will yield scattered to numerous thunderstorms
developing from the Upper Snake Valley north-northwestward into
north-central ID and western MT by early evening.  Forecast
soundings show steep lapse rates and potentially favorable for
localized severe gusts with the stronger thunderstorm cores and
outflow-dominant clusters.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0150 AM CDT Wed Aug 14 2024

Valid 151200Z - 161200Z

...Synopsis...
A mid-level shortwave trough is forecast to cross the northern
California coast early Thursday morning and deepen over western
Oregon during the afternoon hours, bringing with it multiple rounds
of isolated dry thunderstorms across central and eastern Oregon. 


...Dry Thunderstorms...
Some dry thunderstorms are expected to be ongoing at the start of 
the period Thursday morning. However, the greatest likelihood for
thunderstorms will be in the afternoon and early evening hours,
where a mix of scattered wet/dry thunderstorms are forecast across
central and eastern Oregon. Even though fuels are near or at the
90th annual percentile over much of Oregon, the mix of wet/dry
thunderstorms and relatively slow storm motions should result in at
least some wetting rainfall limiting the overall threat despite
scattered storm coverage. 

...Dry/Windy...
Surface winds are expected to remain below Elevated fire-weather
criteria, except for where diurnally and terrain-driven winds are
locally maximized. Given the localized nature of the better surface
winds, no highlights are expected at this time.

Mesoscale Discussion 1889
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0634 PM CDT Mon Aug 12 2024

Areas affected...Northeastern Colorado

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 122334Z - 130100Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...A supercell thunderstorm capable of damaging winds, hail,
and perhaps a tornado is tracking southward across portions of
northeast Colorado. Given the isolated nature of this storm, weather
watch issuance is not likely.

DISCUSSION...The severe weather threat associated with a
southward-moving supercell in northeast Colorado may persist for the
next 1-2 hours. The storm has exhibited signs of prolonged low-level
rotation, has produced 2.00 inch hail, and is moving into an
environment that will continue to support updraft rotation. Forecast
proximity hodographs indicate there is sufficient curvature of the
low-level flow and streamwise vorticity to support continued
low-level mesocyclone development and cycling. Both the curvature
and magnitude of the low-level hodograph is expected to increase as
the nocturnal low-level jet strengthens with the decoupling of the
boundary-layer. However, recent radar trends suggest the storm is
struggling to stay ahead of its own outflow, where temperatures are
15-20 F cooler than unmodified inflow. This supercell will likely
undergo several phases of organized low-level rotation, followed by
surging outflow, until the boundary-layer eventually stabilizes this
evening and convection becomes more elevated in nature.

Mesoscale Discussion 1888
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0513 PM CDT Mon Aug 12 2024

Areas affected...North-central Montana

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 122213Z - 130015Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...A potential will exist for marginally severe gusts and
hail early this evening across parts of north-central Montana. No
watch issuance is anticipated.

DISCUSSION...The latest water-vapor imagery shows a subtle shortwave
trough over the northern Rockies, embedded in southwest mid-level
flow. At the surface, a mesolow is analyzed over north-central
Montana, with upslope east-southeasterly flow located across much of
northern and eastern Montana. Isolated thunderstorms have developed
near and to the north of the low along a narrow corridor of
instability, where the RAP is estimating SBCAPE in the 1000 to 1500
J/kg range. Short-term forecast soundings in north-central Montana
early this evening have a relatively dry boundary layer, but show
steep lapse rates and moderate deep-layer shear. This may be enough
for a marginal severe threat for a few hours. Strong gusts and hail
will be possible.

Day 3 Convective Outlook

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS
OF THE CENTRAL/NORTHERN PLAINS INTO THE MID-MISSOURI VALLEY...

...SUMMARY...
At least isolated severe thunderstorms may occur Wednesday across
parts of the northern/central Plains into the mid Missouri Valley.

...Synopsis...
A band of elevated thunderstorms will likely be ongoing at the
beginning of the period across a broad region of isentropic ascent
from southeast South Dakota to southern Missouri. As the low-level
jet weakens through the morning, expect the intensity of these
storms to lessen as they move east into a more stable airmass. To
the west, an unstable airmass is forecast across much of the central
and northern Plains in the vicinity of a broad surface trough. At
least weak to moderate instability is forecast with the potential
for greater instability in eastern NE/KS where higher dewpoints
(upper 60s to low 70s) are forecast.

The breakdown of the upper-level ridge will lead to height falls
across much of the central and northern Plains. Given the unstable
environment across much of the area, this weak upper-level forcing
combined with the surface trough will likely result in scattered
thunderstorms across much of the central and northern Plains
Wednesday afternoon/evening. A more focused threat may exist farther
south across eastern Kansas in Nebraska. Some enhancement of the
mid-level flow ahead of the ridge breakdown may lead to a localized
region of more favorable wind shear, co-located with the forecast
greater instability. If this occurs, particularly with the
development of a surface low as forecast by the NAM/ECMWF, a locally
greater severe weather threat may occur across this region. At this
time, uncertainty in the mesoscale features which will impact this
potential are too great to warrant higher severe weather
probabilities.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0300 PM CDT Mon Aug 12 2024

Valid 122000Z - 131200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
COASTAL CAROLINAS...CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS...EASTERN GREAT BASIN
NORTHWARD INTO PARTS OF THE NORTH-CENTRAL ROCKIES...AND NORTHERN
MONTANA...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms are possible today over parts of the
coastal Carolinas, central High Plains, the eastern Great Basin
northward into parts of the north-central Rockies, and northern
Montana.

...20z Update...
No changes are needed to the Day 1 Outlook.

Marginal risk for strong to severe gusts and large hail will
continue through the afternoon across the central High
Plains/Central Plains as well as the Intermountain West into the
northern High Plains. See MCD#1186 and MCD#1885 for more
information.

Additional thunderstorm development is expected across a front
portions of South Carolina this afternoon. Ahead of this boundary,
the air mass has destabilized, with around 2000 J/kg of MLCAPE and
20-30 kts of deep layer shear. Thunderstorms will be capable of
instances of strong to severe wind.

..Thornton/Mosier.. 08/12/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1129 AM CDT Mon Aug 12 2024/

...Central High Plains/Central Plains...
Upslope flow will persist across the central High Plains, helping to
maintain moderate low-level moisture across region. Afternoon
dewpoints are expected to range from the upper 60s in the southeast
CO/northeast NM/western Panhandles vicinity to the mid to upper 50s
across eastern WY. This low-level moisture will help support
moderate buoyancy during the afternoon/evening, although some
limited capping may linger. Thunderstorms are expected to develop
across the higher terrain before then progressing eastward into the
more moist and buoyant airmass downstream. Generally moderate
deep-layer vertical shear coupled with the potential for some
remaining convective inhibition suggest the severe potential will
remain isolated, with damaging gusts and/or large hail as the
primary severe risks. 

Thunderstorms will likely persist eastward into more of the central
Plains, supported by moderate buoyancy and shear and the development
of modest low-level jet. Isolated instances of large hail are
possible, but the overall storm severity will likely be tempered by
limited instability. 

...Intermountain West into the Northern High Plains...
Morning satellite imagery depicts upper ridging centered over TX
covering much of the southern third of the CONUS and also extending
northward into MT. Several shortwave troughs are moving through the
westerlies within the northern periphery of this ridging, including
a low-amplitude shortwave currently moving into ID and
northern/central NV and another, more defined shortwave farther west
off the northern CA coast. Eastward/northeastward progression of
these waves will bring greater mid-level moisture and increased
large-scale forcing for ascent, supporting the development of
scattered to numerous thunderstorms across the region. Mid-level
flow will remain modest, but a few more organized/persistent
updrafts are possible. High cloud bases atop steep low-level lapse
rates could result in a few stronger gusts as these more persistent
storms form into clusters, particularly from northern/central UT
into far eastern ID and far western WY and northern MT.

...Coastal Carolinas...
Far southern periphery of an upper trough currently extending from
Quebec through the Upper OH Valley will glance this region today as
it progresses eastward. Modest (i.e. 20-30kt) mid-level flow will
overspread a moisture-rich airmass (i.e. PWs over 2") in place south
of a front. Scattered thunderstorms should develop along this
boundary by early afternoon then propagate toward and off the coast
by early evening. A few water-loaded downbursts capable of damaging
gusts could be noted with the strongest storms.
