Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0750 AM CDT Fri May 23 2025

Valid 231300Z - 241200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE SOUTHERN/CENTRAL PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated to scattered severe thunderstorms should develop across
parts of the southern and central Plains this afternoon through the
overnight hours, with large hail and severe gusts the main threats.
Isolated very large hail greater than 2 inches in diameter may
occur.

...Central/Southern Plains...
In the wake of overnight/early morning convection across parts of
central/south TX, low-level airmass recovery is anticipated today
across much of the southern/central Plains along and south of a
front. Only weak forcing aloft is forecast, as multiple
low-amplitude mid-level shortwave troughs progress
east-southeastward from the southern/central Rockies across the
adjacent High Plains by this evening. Corresponding weak
cyclogenesis over the central High Plains should encourage modest
low-level moisture transport northward into parts of eastern
CO/western KS by peak afternoon heating. A narrow corridor of
sufficient destabilization, along with generally 35-45 kt of
deep-layer shear, should support organized convection. 

Initial development over the central High Plains late this afternoon
should become supercellular and pose a threat for large hail and
severe gusts as it spreads southeastward through the evening. Given
steep lapse rates aloft and elongated hodographs at mid/upper
levels, isolated very large hail may occur. It remains unclear
whether this convection will grow upscale into a cluster across
southern KS/northern OK later in the evening/early overnight hours
as a southerly low-level jet gradually strengthens, or if a separate
cluster will eventually develop. Regardless, the airmass across this
region will be at least moderately unstable, with sufficient
deep-layer shear to support continued updraft organization and a
threat for hail and severe/damaging winds with whatever convection
that can persist this evening/overnight.

Across the southern High Plains, isolated to scattered high-based
thunderstorms may develop this afternoon along/east of the surface
dryline. Weak large-scale forcing and warm low/mid-level
temperatures limit confidence on overall thunderstorm coverage.
Still, any convection which can develop could pose an isolated
threat for severe hail/wind through the early evening before
weakening with the loss of daytime heating.

...Florida...
To the south of a remnant front, at least scattered thunderstorms
should develop this afternoon across parts of the southeast FL
Peninsula. This activity should preferentially form on/near the
Atlantic Coast sea breeze. While mid-level winds are not forecast to
be overly strong, sufficient instability and shear should exist for
modest updraft organization. Any cells/clusters that develop could
produce isolated hail and/or damaging winds.

Valid 261200Z - 311200Z

...DISCUSSION...
...Monday/Day 4 to Wednesday/Day 6...
The medium-range models move a mid-level trough into the southern
and central Plains on Monday. Ahead of the trough, a moist airmass
is forecast from the southern Plains into the Gulf Coast states.
Scattered thunderstorms are expected across much of this airmass
Monday afternoon. The greatest convective coverage should be located
in parts of central and east Texas, where warm advection is forecast
to be maximized. Across the moist airmass, moderate instability will
likely be in place by midday. In addition, westerly flow associated
with the trough, should be strong enough for a severe threat. Large
hail and severe gusts will be possible as a cluster or line of
storms moves southeastward into central and east Texas during the
afternoon and evening.

On Tuesday, the moist airmass is forecast to remain in place from
the southern Plains eastward into the Gulf Coast states, with the
mid-level trough moving into the Ozarks. Model forecasts suggest
that numerous thunderstorms will develop ahead of the trough in
parts of the Southeast, with more isolated development occurring
across the southern Plains. Although a severe threat will be
possible across parts of this airmass, mesoscale processes will
determine the most favorable areas for severe. It appears that
instability will support isolated wind damage and hail, but
predictability appears low concerning the spatial distribution of
any isolated threat.

On Wednesday, the most unstable air is forecast from parts of
central and south Texas eastward into the lower Mississippi Valley.
Although large-scale ascent is forecast to be weak, thunderstorms
should develop in areas that warm up sufficiently along residual
outflow boundaries. An isolated severe threat should develop during
the mid to late afternoon, but predictability appears to be low.

...Thursday/Day 7 and Friday/Day 8...
On Thursday and Friday, westerly mid-level flow is forecast over the
southern U.S., where an unstable airmass is expected to remain in
place. As surface temperatures warm each day, isolated to scattered
thunderstorm development should take place. Although instability and
shear will be favorable for severe storms in a few areas,
predictability remains low.

In addition, on Friday convection will be possible ahead of a cold
front across parts of the Atlantic Seaboard. Enough instability
should be in place during the day for an isolated severe threat.
However, the spatial distribution of any potential threat appears to
have low predictability.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0135 AM CDT Fri May 23 2025

Valid 241200Z - 251200Z

...Synopsis...
A mid-level wave will shift across the Southwest on Saturday.
Enhanced mid-level flow will largely pass overnight D1/Friday into
D2/Saturday, with relaxing pressure gradients through the day.
Though afternoon relative humidity will remain low (around 10
percent), this relaxing gradient will keep winds largely below
Critical values. In addition, an increase in mid-level cloud cover
is expected which may limit mixing. In more favored downslope
regions, locally stronger winds will be possible and support periods
of localized Critical fire weather. Overall, the broad Elevated
delineation was maintained where highest confidence in sustained
Elevated conditions were expected across eastern Arizona into
southeastern Utah and across south-central/western New Mexico.

Mesoscale Discussion 0932
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0224 PM CDT Thu May 22 2025

Areas affected...parts of the Texas South Plains

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 221924Z - 222130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated strong to severe thunderstorm development,
perhaps including an evolving supercell or two, appears possible
through 3-5 PM CDT, accompanied by a risk for large hail and locally
damaging wind gusts.

DISCUSSION...Daytime heating and deep-boundary layer mixing focused
along the dryline across the Texas South Plains is contributing to
weakening inhibition as far north as a diffuse surface front
extending near/south of Childress toward the Lubbock vicinity.  This
is coinciding with deepening convective development, which seems
likely to persist, particularly where low-level convergence is
strongest near the boundary intersection.

Although beneath more modest northwesterly mid-level flow/deep-layer
shear than closer to the Red River, as updrafts acquire increasing
inflow of air characterized by mixed-layer CAPE as high as 2000-3000
J/kg, isolated supercell development posing a risk for large hail
and damaging wind gusts appear possible.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 312
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
305 PM CDT Thu May 22 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Southwest and South-Central Oklahoma
  Western and North Texas

* Effective this Thursday afternoon and evening from 305 PM until
  1000 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail likely with isolated very large hail events
    to 3 inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Severe storms including supercells are expected to
steadily develop through late afternoon, including across western
north Texas and southwest Oklahoma near a boundary from prior
storms, and also across the Texas South Plains. Storms may
eventually merge/cluster across parts of the Low Rolling Plains and
western North Texas. Potentially very large hail and severe-caliber
wind gusts are the primary hazards.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 80
statute miles north and south of a line from 65 miles east of
Wichita Falls TX to 55 miles north of Big Spring TX. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU2).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 311...

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
3 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 550. Mean storm motion vector
29025.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0257 PM CDT Thu May 22 2025

Valid 222000Z - 231200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS PARTS OF
NORTHWEST/NORTH TEXAS...

...SUMMARY...
Severe storms are expected through the afternoon and evening across
the southern Plains, especially within the Low Rolling Plains into
parts of North Texas. Large hail and damaging winds are the primary
hazards, with a few instances of 2+ inch diameter hail possible.

...20Z Update...
The cluster of supercells that move through south-central Oklahoma
and North Texas earlier have diminished in intensity. In their wake
an outflow boundary has drifted southwestward into Northwest Texas
and parts of the Low Rolling Plains. Here, thunderstorms have
recently developed. Large buoyancy and moderate effective shear will
continue to support large/very large hail with the strongest storms.
Additional towering cumulus are developing in the South Plains along
the surface trough/dryline. This activity should intensify this
afternoon and tend to move east/southeast along the outflow
boundary. Large hail and severe gusts will be possible. Strong
mixing has been noted in central Texas where dewpoints have fallen
into the low 50s F in some places. As this air moves toward
convection farther north, storms may have some tendency to become
more outflow dominant. Should a more organized cluster/MCS develop,
wind gusts of 75+ mph would be possible.

...Southern Plains including southern OK/northern Texas...
Initially elevated, scattered, upscale-growing storms have evolved
this morning across south-central Oklahoma. These storms will likely
persist south-southeastward along the baroclinic gradient,
potentially becoming increasingly surface based this afternoon.
Additional southwest-peripheral development is also anticipated
generally near the Red River as outflow/differential heating
interfaces with the synoptic boundary with an aggressively
destabilizing boundary layer, with upwards of 2500-3000+ J/kg MLCAPE
plausible across far southwest Oklahoma into a broader part of
nearby north Texas. 

Wind profiles will support supercells with the initial/renewed
development, with clusters otherwise persisting/evolving with the
ongoing Red River-vicinity storms and with anticipated additional
development later today across southwest Oklahoma into/across the
Low Rolling Plains of Texas. Very large hail is possible along with
damaging wind potential, and some tornado risk may exist as well,
although low-level shear/SRH will tend to remain modest overall.

...Southern/Eastern Florida...
Seasonally cool 500-mb temperatures (-8 to -10 deg C) and moderately
steep mid-level lapse rates are forecast equatorward of a
large-scale eastern U.S. upper trough over the East. Deep westerly
flow favors an east coast sea breeze, and this should be where
convection focuses as temperatures warm through the upper 80s and
lower 90s. Localized severe gusts and large hail are the primary
threats with this diurnally maximized convection.

...Coastal Mid-Atlantic States...
Sufficient buoyancy coincident with moderately strong wind profiles
may support isolated severe low-topped storms this afternoon through
around sunset in vicinity of a secondary frontal zone/triple point.

...Central High Plains...
The eastward-migrating mid-level trough over the northern Rockies
will favor southeasterly low-level upslope flow into the central
High Plains. Modest moisture coupled with strong heating will yield
250-750 J/kg SBCAPE by mid-afternoon east of the Front Range. While
storms should remain relatively isolated, elongated straight-line
hodographs will support east-southeastward moving storms within an
environment featuring steep 700-500 mb lapse rates (8 deg C/km).
Isolated large hail and severe-caliber wind gusts will be possible.

...Northern Idaho/southwest Montana/northwest Wyoming...
Some stronger to locally severe low-topped storms may occur later
today within a modestly moist/unstable environment ahead of the
amplifying shortwave trough over the Pacific Northwest and northern
Intermountain region.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0223 PM CDT Thu May 22 2025

Valid 241200Z - 251200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS OF
THE SOUTHERN PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Severe storms are likely across portions of the southern Plains on
Saturday. Severe wind gusts and large hail are the main threats, and
a few instances of 2+ inch diameter hail may occur. Isolated strong
to severe storms remain possible across a broad region from the
central High Plains to the Southeast.

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will continue to progress eastward across the
Interior West as upper ridging persists over the central CONUS, and
broad northwesterly mid-level flow (from a departing trough)
overspreads the Mid-MS Valley to the East Coast on Saturday.
Relatively rich low-level moisture will continue to pivot around a
quasi-stationary surface low over the southern High Plains, fueling
the potential for strong thunderstorm development from the High
Plains to the Southeast. Thunderstorms will be ongoing at the start
of the period over the central Plains into the Lower MS Valley. The
morning convection may leave an outflow boundary to serve as the
impetus for more robust, severe storm development Saturday afternoon
across far northwest TX into western and central OK.

...Far Northwest Texas into Western and central Oklahoma...
Mid-morning thunderstorms, perhaps in the form of an MCS, will be
traversing the terminus of a weakening low-level jet, leaving behind
an outflow boundary, likely positioned somewhere near the KS/OK
border. By afternoon, redevelopment of storms is likely ahead of the
surface low and along/south of the pre-existing boundary. The
airmass preceding these storms will be very to extremely unstable,
with low 70s F dewpoints beneath 9+ C/km mid-level lapse supporting
deep, wide CAPE profiles, with 4000-5000 J/kg MLCAPE values
expected. Modest veering with height will support 35 kts of
effective bulk shear, characterized by hodographs with some
elongation and curvature. Given the expected degree of instability,
supercells are the likely storm mode, with severe wind and large to
very large hail the main threats.

...Portions of Western Texas...
Strong heating of the boundary layer will encourage the eastward
advancement of the dryline, which will support thunderstorm
initiation by mid to late afternoon. These storms should be
high-based as they develop atop a boundary layer that may extend up
to at least 700 mb, with 30+ F T/Td spreads likely. Deep-layer flow
and shear will be weaker farther south, and when considering the
high degree of evaporative cooling expected in a dry boundary layer,
outflow-dominant multicells are expected. An instance of severe hail
may occur with initial updrafts, followed by severe gust potential
with subsequent downbursts and larger scale outflow from decaying
multicells.

...Central High Plains...
Surface-850 mb upslope flow along the higher terrain of the central
High Plains may encourage isolated thunderstorm development by mid
to late afternoon. NAM forecast soundings show a stable boundary
layer in place, suggesting that storms should be elevated.
Nonetheless, forecast hodographs show considerable elongation above
the stable layer, indicating that multicell and supercell structures
are possible, perhaps accompanied by a sparse hail/strong gust
threat.

...Lower MS Valley into the Southeast...
The aforementioned strong storms/possible MCS across the southern
Plains during the morning hours may shift eastward along a diffuse
baroclinic boundary. Assuming these storms persist toward the
Southeast with some appreciable degree of intensity, an instance or
two of strong wind gusts or hail are possible. Later Saturday
evening/overnight, strong storms across the southern Plains may
persist eastward as the low-level jet strengthens. Should this be
the case, 7-8 C/km mid-level lapse rates (supporting over 2000 J/kg
MLCAPE), along with elongated hodographs, may support the approach
of another nocturnal MCS, accompanied by a sparse wind/hail threat.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1228 PM CDT Thu May 22 2025

Valid 231200Z - 241200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR PORTIONS OF
THE CENTRAL INTO SOUTHERN PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
A few severe storms are expected across portions of the central into
southern Plains on Friday, with large hail and severe gusts the main
threats. More isolated strong to severe storms remain possible
across portions of western Texas and southeast Florida.

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will eject into the Atlantic as upper ridging
prevails over the central CONUS and a mid-level trough impinges on
the Interior West tomorrow (Friday). An embedded mid-level impulse
will crest the central U.S. ridge, encouraging surface low
development over the southern Plains. Rich low-level moisture will
cyclonically pivot around the low through the forecast period, with
at least some of this moisture reaching the Colorado Front Range by
late afternoon. Strong to severe thunderstorms should develop over
the central High Plains during the afternoon, with additional
development possible overnight across the central to southern Plains
at the nose of a low-level jet. A few strong storms also remain
possible over eastern parts of the Florida Peninsula along
sea-breeze boundaries.

...Central High Plains (Late Afternoon and Evening)...
By afternoon, southeasterly upslope flow along the higher terrain,
from the Colorado Front Range to the WY/NE border, will advect
adequate moisture that is pivoting northward around the surface low.
At least mid 50s F surface dewpoints, beneath 9 C/km low and
mid-level lapse rates, will contribute to 1000-2000 J/kg MLCAPE.
40-50 kts of northwesterly 500 mb flow from the upper ridge,
overspreading weaker southeasterly flow, will support elongated,
mostly straight hodographs and corresponding 35-40 kts of effective
bulk shear. Storms that form and move off of the higher terrain
should be splitting supercells with mainly a large hail threat,
perhaps accompanied by severe gusts as well. Given such steep lapse
rates through a deep-layer of the troposphere, and elongated
hodographs, 2+ inch diameter hail is possible and a tornado cannot
be ruled out.

...Southern High Plains (Late Afternoon and Evening)...
By afternoon peak heating, robust mixing within the boundary layer
will encourage the eastward advancement of the dryline over western
TX. Resultant low-level convergence along the dryline will support
the development of high-based storms atop a surface airmass with mid
90s/upper 50s F temperatures/dewpoints. 8-9 C/km lapse rates through
most of the troposphere will boost MLCAPE to 3000 J/kg, while
gradual veering with height of the vertical wind profiles supports
over 35+ kts of effective bulk shear. Isolated multicell complexes
should develop, and given poor low-level shear and high evaporative
cooling potential, these storms should be outflow dominant. A couple
instances of large hail may accompany the stronger storm cores at
the beginning of their life-cycles, followed by the potential for a
severe gust or two when cold pools/outflow becomes dominant. Storms
should diminish during the evening as the boundary layer stabilizes
and the dryline retreats westward.

...Central into the Southern Plains (Overnight)...
Considerable amounts of convective inhibition should be in place
across much of the central into southern Plains tomorrow afternoon
and evening, casting doubt on the persistence of the central High
Plains supercells into this region overnight. However, even if the
High Plains supercells dissipate, additional storm development is
likely overnight. A 40-50 kt southwesterly low-level jet, centered
at about 850 mb in altitude, is expected to develop over the
southern Plains, with the terminus positioned over southern KS
between 00-06Z. Elevated storms should develop along the terminus,
atop the inversion layer (i.e. above 850 mb). 9+ C/km 850-500 mb
lapse rates and elongated hodographs will support supercell
structures with a large hail risk, though upscale growth into an MCS
is possible, with a continued risk for hail and perhaps a few severe
gusts if a strong enough cold pool can develop. 

...Eastern Florida Peninsula (Afternoon)...
By late morning into early afternoon, robust surface heating will
support the mixing and destabilization of a moist boundary layer,
with near 70 F dewpoints beneath 7+ C/km mid-level lapse rates
resulting in 2000-3000 J/kg SBCAPE. The strong surface heating will
encourage the generation and onshore movement of sea-breeze
boundaries, which in tandem with the heating will support
thunderstorm initiation. Modest westerly mid-level flow
overspreading this environment will encourage 30+ kts of effective
bulk shear (modestly elongated, straight hodographs), supporting the
potential for multicellular development, along with an isolated wind
gust/hail threat with the stronger storms.

Valid 221700Z - 231200Z

...Southeastern Utah...
Fuels are becoming more receptive to fire spread across portions of
eastern Utah. Breezy southwest winds of 10-15 mph (with occasional
20 mph speeds in favored terrain) attributed to a trough passing
through the Great Basin are expected this afternoon. Relative
humidity already in the teens will drop further through the
afternoon hours to single digits in lower elevations. The
overlapping winds within a very dry air mass amid dry fuels prompted
Elevated highlights across portions of southeastern Utah.

...Southeastern Arizona...
Locally elevated fire weather conditions are expected this afternoon
as winds increase to 10-15 mph in concert with single digit relative
humidity. Higher wind gusts of 20-25 mph can be expected along
leeward slopes of southeastern Arizona mountain ranges this
afternoon. In addition, poor overnight relative humidity recoveries,
even in higher elevations, will promote prolonged burn periods
within very dry fuels.

..Williams.. 05/22/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1229 AM CDT Thu May 22 2025/

...Synopsis...
Along the southern periphery of a midlevel trough and related jet
streak moving eastward across the Northwest/Great Basin, moderate
westerly flow will overspread a deeply mixed boundary layer over the
Mogollon Rim into west-central NM. This will promote breezy surface
winds amid single-digit RH -- yielding elevated fire-weather
conditions.

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS NORTH
TEXAS AND FAR SOUTHERN OKLAHOMA...

...SUMMARY...
Severe storms are expected through the afternoon and evening across
the southern Plains, especially across north Texas and southern
Oklahoma. Large hail and damaging winds are the primary hazards,
with a few instances of 2+ inch diameter hail possible.

...Southern Plains including southern OK/northern Texas...
Initially elevated, scattered, upscale-growing storms have evolved
this morning across south-central Oklahoma. These storms will likely
persist south-southeastward along the baroclinic gradient,
potentially becoming increasingly surface based this afternoon.
Additional southwest-peripheral development is also anticipated
generally near the Red River as outflow/differential heating
interfaces with the synoptic boundary with an aggressively
destabilizing boundary layer, with upwards of 2500-3000+ J/kg MLCAPE
plausible across far southwest Oklahoma into a broader part of
nearby north Texas. 

Wind profiles will support supercells with the initial/renewed
development, with clusters otherwise persisting/evolving with the
ongoing Red River-vicinity storms and with anticipated additional
development later today across southwest Oklahoma into/across the
Low Rolling Plains of Texas. Very large hail is possible along with
damaging wind potential, and some tornado risk may exist as well,
although low-level shear/SRH will tend to remain modest overall.

...Southern/Eastern Florida...
Seasonally cool 500-mb temperatures (-8 to -10 deg C) and moderately
steep mid-level lapse rates are forecast equatorward of a
large-scale eastern U.S. upper trough over the East. Deep westerly
flow favors an east coast sea breeze, and this should be where
convection focuses as temperatures warm through the upper 80s and
lower 90s. Localized severe gusts and large hail are the primary
threats with this diurnally maximized convection.

...Coastal Mid-Atlantic States...
Sufficient buoyancy coincident with moderately strong wind profiles
may support isolated severe low-topped storms this afternoon through
around sunset in vicinity of a secondary frontal zone/triple point.

...Central High Plains...
The eastward-migrating mid-level trough over the northern Rockies
will favor southeasterly low-level upslope flow into the central
High Plains. Modest moisture coupled with strong heating will yield
250-750 J/kg SBCAPE by mid-afternoon east of the Front Range. While
storms should remain relatively isolated, elongated straight-line
hodographs will support east-southeastward moving storms within an
environment featuring steep 700-500 mb lapse rates (8 deg C/km).
Isolated large hail and severe-caliber wind gusts will be possible.

...Northern Idaho/southwest Montana/northwest Wyoming...
Some stronger to locally severe low-topped storms may occur later
today within a modestly moist/unstable environment ahead of the
amplifying shortwave trough over the Pacific Northwest and northern
Intermountain region.

Mesoscale Discussion 0923
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0155 PM CDT Wed May 21 2025

Areas affected...parts of south central Nebraska into north central
Kansas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 211855Z - 212130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...A consolidating area of southeastward developing
thunderstorm activity may be accompanied by increasing strong to
severe wind gusts by 4-6 PM CDT.  It is not clear that a severe
weather watch is needed, but trends will be monitored.

DISCUSSION...Beneath seasonably cold (temperatures around/below -20
C at 500 mb) and strong (40-50 kt at 500 mb) west-northwesterly
mid-level flow, low-level lapse rates are becoming quite steep, with
sufficient boundary-layer moisture to support weak CAPE and
scattered developing thunderstorm activity across parts of south
central Nebraska and northeastern Colorado into northwestern Kansas.
 It appears that convection will continue to gradually increase and
modestly intensify with further destabilization through late
afternoon.  

Aided by large-scale forcing for ascent associated with a
southeastward developing area of lower/mid-tropospheric warm
advection, various model output suggests that convection may
gradually grow upscale into a cluster across the central
Nebraska/Kansas border vicinity through 21-23Z.  Coinciding with
peak daytime heating, and deep boundary-layer mixing (including
surface temperature/dew point spreads around 35-40F), strong
downdrafts, enhanced by evaporative cooling and downward mixing of
momentum, may contribute to a few locally severe surface gusts. 
Gradually, consolidating outflow may yield an expanding area of
strong to, perhaps, severe gusts, before convection wanes this
evening.

Areas affected...Eastern Arkansas to the Tennessee River Valley

Concerning...Tornado Watch 303...305...

Valid 202033Z - 202230Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 303, 305 continues.

SUMMARY...The threat for large hail and tornadoes continues across
watches 303 and 305, though the potential for widespread damaging
winds is expected to increase over the next 2-3 hours across for
parts of northwest TN and far southwest KY. The greatest
hail/tornado threat will likely be focused across southeast AR into
northeast MS and parts of middle TN.

DISCUSSION...Numerous supercells continue to mature across eastern
AR with more isolated to scattered coverage across northern MS into
western/middle TN. Convective coverage/close storm proximity has
resulted in destructive interactions of the past hour across
northeast AR, and recent velocity imagery from KNQA shows signs of
consolidating outflow across northeast AR. This suggests that the
early stages of upscale growth is occurring and may promote an
increasing damaging/severe wind threat downstream into parts of
western TN and west/southwest KY. Strong low-level shear sampled by
the KQNA VWP hints that even with this storm mode transition,
embedded circulations will be possible as the line becomes more
organized. 

Further east and south, more isolated to scattered storm coverage
has yielded more discrete supercells. Large hail up to golf ball
size has already been reported, and with a very buoyant and strongly
sheared environment still in place downstream, very large hail will
remain a concern for far southeast AR, northern MS, and parts of
middle TN. Recent WoFS guidance suggests hail sizes between 2 to 2.5
inches will be possible with these cells over the next couple of
hours. These discrete storms are beginning to display organized
mesocyclones and will continue to migrate across a warm sector with
STP values between 2-3, suggesting that the tornado threat
(including the potential for a strong tornado) is likely increasing
with these cells.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0242 PM CDT Tue May 20 2025

Areas affected...parts of ern Kentucky...ern
Tennessee...southwestern Virginia and southwestern West Virginia

Concerning...Tornado Watch 302...

Valid 201942Z - 202145Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 302 continues.

SUMMARY...The line of storms overspreading the region could still
intensify and organize further during the next couple of hours,
accompanied by increasing potential for strong to severe surface
gusts, and perhaps a tornado.

DISCUSSION...The narrow linear convective system has maintained
generally modest intensity as it continues to advance into/across
the Cumberland and southern Allegheny Plateau vicinity.  Due to the
strength of the upper flow/shear, there has been little in the way
of trailing anvil precipitation develop, and the elongated
convectively generated surface cold pool remains modest to weak in
strength.  However, in the presence of strong deep-layer shear,
objective analysis indicates the potential for continuing updraft
inflow of moist boundary-layer air, characterized by CAPE of
500-1000 J/kg, into the crest of the higher terrain.  This could
still promote further intensification and organization during the
next few hours.  

Where it is intersected by the line of storms, the quasi-stationary
to warm frontal zone, north of Jackson KY toward the Charleston WV
area, may still provide one possible focus for an evolving meso-beta
scale cyclonic circulation, with increasing potential for damaging
wind gusts and/or a tornado.

    to 2 inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...A few strong to severe thunderstorms will track
northeastward across the watch area.  Large hail and a few tornadoes
appear to be the main threats.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 65 statute miles
east and west of a line from 55 miles north northeast of Peoria IL
to 15 miles south southeast of Mattoon IL. For a complete depiction
of the watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS
WOU4).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 302...WW 303...

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 2 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 60 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 450. Mean
storm motion vector 24030.

PUBLIC SEVERE WEATHER OUTLOOK  
NWS STORM PREDICTION CENTER NORMAN OK
0840 PM CDT MON MAY 19 2025

...Severe thunderstorms expected over parts of the southern Plains
into the Ozarks and mid Mississippi Valley this evening and
overnight...

* LOCATIONS...
  Western and Northern Arkansas
  Missouri
  Far Eastern Oklahoma
  North-Central and Northeast Texas
  Southern Illinois

* HAZARDS...
  Widespread damaging winds, some hurricane force
  Several tornadoes, a few intense
  Scattered large hail, some baseball size

* SUMMARY...
  A significant severe weather episode should continue tonight
  across parts of the South-Central States. Strong tornadoes,
  scattered to widespread damaging wind swaths, and very large
  hail remain possible.

Preparedness actions...

Tornadoes at night can be particularly dangerous because they 
are usually fast-moving and difficult to see. Stay tuned to
NOAA Weather Radio, weather.gov, or other media for watches and
warnings. A tornado watch means that conditions are favorable
for tornadoes to form during the next several hours. If a tornado
warning is issued for your area, move to a place of safety,
ideally in a basement or interior room on the lowest floor of a
sturdy building.

Mesoscale Discussion 0883
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0338 PM CDT Mon May 19 2025

Areas affected...parts of east central and northeastern Oklahoma

Concerning...Tornado Watch 292...

Valid 192038Z - 192245Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 292 continues.

SUMMARY...Long-lived discrete supercell development accompanied by
potential for a couple of strong tornadoes remains possible, while
spreading across the I-40 into I-44 corridors of northeastern
Oklahoma through 5-7 PM CDT.

DISCUSSION...A clustering of strong to severe storms, including a
couple of sustained tornado producing supercells continues to
develop north/northeastward, within a seasonably moist and
moderately unstable warm sector, well east of the dryline.  This has
been supported by a weak lead mid-level perturbation progressing
toward the Ozark Plateau.

The supercells are generally focused along/west of a strengthening
(40+ kt) 850 mb jet axis, and now within an area of stronger surface
pressure falls (including 2-3+ mb/2 hourly, evident in 20Z surface
observations).  As long as the supercells remain more or less
discrete, the environment remains conducive to additional tornado
development, with perhaps some increase in potential for a strong
tornado or two into early evening.

0331 PM CDT Mon May 19 2025

Areas affected...Southern Iowa into northeast Missouri

Concerning...Severe potential...Severe Thunderstorm Watch likely 

Valid 192031Z - 192200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms moving out of northern Missouri will pose a
severe hail risk for parts of southern Iowa and northeast Missouri
over the next few hours. Watch issuance is expected.

DISCUSSION...Elevated convection continues to rapidly develop
northward across northern Missouri and is spreading into
south-central Iowa within a zone of strong warm air advection
between 925-850 mb. Despite being elevated in nature, MUCAPE and
effective shear downstream across IA and northeast MO remains very
favorable for organized convection (MUCAPE 1500-2000 J/kg and 45-55
knots respectively). Storm mode will likely remain a mix of
supercells and clusters, but intense updrafts will be capable of
producing severe hail, most likely between 1 to 2 inches diameter. A
severe thunderstorm watch will be needed soon to address this
threat.

Mesoscale Discussion 0881
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0312 PM CDT Mon May 19 2025

Areas affected...Southeast Nebraska to northeast Kansas

Concerning...Tornado Watch 293...294...

Valid 192012Z - 192215Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 293, 294 continues.

SUMMARY...The threat for large hail, severe wind, and tornadoes
continues across southeast Nebraska into northeast Kansas, though a
couple of localized corridors of higher tornado potential are
becoming apparent.

DISCUSSION...Convection developing along a cold front/confluence
axis across southeast NE continues to intensify, and a few cells
have begun to show signs of persistent mid-level rotation based on
KUEX velocity imagery. Additional cells continue to develop along
the boundary, so storm coverage is expected to increase over the
next 1-2 hours.  Ambient vorticity along the strongly confluent
boundary coupled with strong, organizing updrafts deepening atop the
boundary should support a tornado threat for the next few hours,
though tornado strength/longevity may be modulated by destructive
storm interactions. Regardless, a large hail threat will continue
with 1 inch hail recently reported. 

Further southeast into northeast KS, deep convection is developing
along the dryline per GOES imagery and latest lightning data.
Modifying an 18 UTC OAX sounding based on warm sector observations
suggests that sufficient buoyancy and low-level helicity is in place
to support STP values up to 2 downstream of the developing storms.
Strong cross-boundary flow should promote supercellular storm modes
with a strong tornado and very large hail threat for the next couple
of hours along the KS/NE border.

Mesoscale Discussion 0880
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0234 PM CDT Mon May 19 2025

Areas affected...Northeast Arkansas and adjacent portions of
Mississippi...Tennessee...and Missouri

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 191934Z - 192130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated convection developing across northeast
Arkansas/parts of the mid-Mississippi River Valley may sufficiently
intensify to pose a hail/wind threat through late afternoon.
Coverage of strong/severe storms should remain too limited for watch
issuance.

DISCUSSION...Over the past hour, shallow convection has percolated
across northeast AR as temperatures warm into the mid 80s amid low
to mid 70 dewpoints. Within the last 15 minutes, GOES IR imagery
shows a few deeper towers developing, suggesting that this
convection is beginning to overcome lingering MLCIN and fully
realizing the high-buoyancy environment (MLCAPE estimated between
2500-3000 J/kg). 30-40 knot flow between 5-6 km sampled by regional
VWPs is supporting bulk shear values around 30 knots, which should
be sufficient to support a few stronger/severe cells through late
afternoon. Large hail should be the primary concern with
deeper/stronger cells, though numerous storms in close proximity may
promote destructive storm interactions and/or some degree of
clustering with an more pronounced damaging wind threat. In general,
severe storm coverage should remain sufficiently limited due to weak
forcing for ascent to preclude watch issuance at this time (though a
more robust/widespread severe threat is expected to emerge later
tonight).

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0322 PM CDT Mon May 19 2025

Valid 211200Z - 271200Z

Mainly zonal mid-level flow through the middle of the week will give
way to upper ridging in the Plains as mid-level troughs deepen
across the western and eastern U.S. by the end of the week. By the
weekend into early next week, the western mid-level trough will
de-amplify while progressing toward the Plains. Surface high
pressure will build across the central and northern U.S. through the
week, while a surface low will encourage the northward return of
moisture across the southern Plains by the end of the week toward
the weekend. Overall quiescent fire weather conditions are expected
through most of the extended range. The largest concern for future
significant wildfire-spread potential remains across portions of the
Southwest, where prolonged warm and dry conditions will support the
continued curing of fuels. Disagreement remains among medium-range
guidance members in terms of the evolution of the de-amplifying
western upper trough by the weekend. Stronger surface winds may
develop over parts of the Southwest by the weekend, but confidence
in this scenario is too low for the introduction of Critical
probabilities at this time.

Mesoscale Discussion 0860
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0321 PM CDT Sun May 18 2025

Areas affected...much of western Oklahoma...southwest
Kansas...extreme eastern Panhandle

Concerning...Severe potential...Tornado Watch likely 

Valid 182021Z - 182215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered supercells capable of strong tornadoes and very
large hail are forecast from late afternoon into the evening from
parts of northwest Oklahoma into southwest Kansas. EF3+ tornadoes
may occur.

DISCUSSION...Surface analysis and visible imagery clearly outline
the unstable warm sector, situated between a dryline from southeast
CO into the eastern TX Panhandle, and a warm front/retreating
outflow draped across northern OK into south-central KS. The air
mass has become very unstable, and will continue to develop
northward. This air mass is coincident with an already strongly
sheared environment with effective SRH over 200 m2/s2. These
low-level shear values will increase markedly later today and during
the evening as the low level jet increases with effective SRH of
300-400 m2/s2 common.

While very cool air and clouds currently exist over northern OK into
south-central KS, a strengthening low-level jet will likely yield
clearing later in the evening, which may allow the tornado threat to
expand farther eastward.

Mesoscale Discussion 0859
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0212 PM CDT Sun May 18 2025

Areas affected...northeast Colorado...western Nebraska...northwest
Kansas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 181912Z - 182145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...Supercells capable of very large hail, tornadoes, and
damaging wind are likely to develop after 21Z over northeast
Colorado, spreading into western Nebraska and northwest Kansas
through evening.

DISCUSSION...A surface low continues to deepen over eastern CO as
the shortwave trough moves across the area. Surface analysis shows a
prominent plume of low-level moisture extending out of western KS
and across northeast CO, where dewpoints are holding in the lower
50s F. 

Full heating near and south of this moisture plume will erode the
minimal capping inversion by around 21Z, and rapid thunderstorm
development is expected. The combination of strong instability,
steep lapse rates, and veering winds with height will strongly favor
supercells capable of very large hail, and a few tornadoes. Activity
should easily remain severe into NE and KS this evening as the
southeasterly low-level jet persists, maintaining moisture advection
as well as shear and inflow.

Mesoscale Discussion 0858
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0158 PM CDT Sun May 18 2025

Areas affected...Northwest to west-central Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 181858Z - 182130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm development along the dryline is expected
roughly between 20-22 UTC across northwest to west-central Texas.
The convective environment will support supercells capable of large
hail, severe gusts, and a few tornadoes. Watch issuance is likely as
storms begin to develop.

DISCUSSION...Recent GOES visible imagery shows shallow, but slowly
deepening, cumulus along and just ahead of a sharpening dryline as
it continues to mix east and boundary-layer depth increases amid
filtered diurnal heating. Latest RAP/HRRR forecast soundings suggest
any lingering MLCIN will be minimized as surface temperatures warm
into the 92-95 F range over the next few hours within the warm
sector. Regional VWPs show flow within the lowest 2-3 km AGL
oriented roughly along the dryline, which should promote adequate
residence times for parcels to reach their LFCs and initiate deep
convection. Latest high-res solutions suggest this should occur
generally between 20-22 UTC. Thunderstorms will mature within a very
unstable air mass with MLCAPE values exceeding 4000 J/kg and
effective shear on the order of 40-50 knots. Limited directional
shear will initially promote splitting supercells with an attendant
very large hail threat (most probable max hail size may be 2-3
inches in diameter). Southeasterly low-level winds across northwest
TX may support adequate low-level veering for some tornado threat.
Further south (roughly south of I-20), 1.5 to 2.5 km LCL heights and
more backed low-level flow will modulate the initial tornado
potential. After 00 UTC a strengthening low-level jet will increase

threat with any remaining discrete right-moving supercells across

Mesoscale Discussion 0854
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0656 AM CDT Sun May 18 2025

Areas affected...central Arkansas and northern Mississippi

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 284...

Valid 181156Z - 181400Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 284
continues.

SUMMARY...Long-lived cluster of thunderstorms, with a history of
producing wind damage, continues to move through central Arkansas.
The overall environment should continue to support a severe threat
ahead of this MCS through at least mid morning.

DISCUSSION...Long-lived linear MCS, with a history of producing wind
damage, continues to move east-southeast through much of Arkansas
this morning. This MCS is moving along a west-northwest to
east-southeast CAPE gradient stretching from northeast Oklahoma into
southern Georgia and is following a similar path as to an earlier
MCS from last evening into earlier this morning. 

The overall large-scale environment will continue to support
maintenance of this MCS as the MCS has access to MUCAPE greater than
2000 J/kg and effective shear around 50 knots. The organization of
the MCS, the overall favorable environment,and knowledge that the
earlier MCS traversed a similar environment and is continuing
through Alabama supports the severe threat through the morning. A
downstream watch may become necessary for portions of far eastern
Arkansas and northern Mississippi as the MCS approaches the edge of
Severe Thunderstorm Watch #284.

Mesoscale Discussion 0853
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0640 AM CDT Sun May 18 2025

Areas affected...Central Alabama and far west-central Georgia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 181140Z - 181245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...A thunderstorm cluster moving across central Alabama will
pose a threat for isolated large hail and wind damage in the near
term. Longer term evolution of this cluster is less certain, but the
area will continue to be monitored for potential watch issuance.

DISCUSSION...Long-lived cluster of thunderstorms continues to move
across central Alabama this morning along the instability gradient.
The strongest of these thunderstorms (located across eastern
Tuscaloosa County) appears to have increased in intensity over the
last hour and has even developed a rear-inflow jet (RIJ) --
suggested by radar reflectivity structure and an increase in
rear-to-front wind speeds. This will pose a damaging wind threat in
the short term.

Additionally, overall reflectivity structure of the thunderstorm
complex suggests the development of a mesoscale convective vortex.
Should this be the case, an increase in updraft intensity would be
expected in the near term owing to increasing convergence and
stronger deep-layer shear. MUCAPE is around 1000 J/kg and deep-layer
shear around 50 knots across the thunderstorm cluster now, but drops
off to around 1000 J/kg and 30-40 knots as the cluster approaches
western Georgia.

As the thunderstorms move east, the lack of clarity of the MCV
evolution and a slightly less favorable environment results in
uncertainty as to whether a severe thunderstorm watch will be needed
downstream. Conditions will continue to be monitored for potential
watch issuance.
