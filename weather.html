Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0746 AM CDT Mon Sep 16 2024

Valid 161300Z - 171200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS IN THE EASTERN
CAROLINAS AND PARTS OF THE NORTHERN PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
A tornado threat exists in the eastern Carolinas.  Thunderstorms
capable of severe gusts and large hail are expected today in parts
of the northern Plains.  Isolated severe wind and hail are expected
in parts of the Four Corners and Great Basin.

...Synopsis...
A highly amplified pattern is expected in mid/upper levels, anchored
by two cyclones:
1.  A purely cold-core, midlatitude circulation initially centered
over northern CA, with accompanying cyclonic flow covering most of
the CONUS from the Rockies westward.  Equatorward progression of
this feature is about done, and the 500-mb low should pivot eastward
across the RNO area by 00Z, then east-northeastward toward EKO
overnight.  In the downstream difluent flow, a shortwave trough is
apparent in moisture-channel imagery over the western Dakotas.  This
feature should move northeastward to southwestern MB by 00Z, then to
westernmost parts of northwest ON overnight.
2.  What is now a small, deep-layer circulation just offshore from
ILM and MYR, designated Potential Tropical Cyclone 8 by NHC as of
this writing.  This system may become subtropical or tropical before
moving inland later today, per NHC discussions.  Regardless of
whether it is named, the system will offer some tornado potential
(below).  The associated mid/upper low is progged to become better
defined through the day and moving farther inland, with the
low-level center tracking not far behind. 

As the surface, aside from PTC 8 and its attached frontal zone, the
11Z analysis showed a quasistationary front extending northeastward
from a low near SHR, across southeastern MT to north-central ND,
behind the outflow of a mass of ongoing convection over ND.  The
outflow boundary should act as the effective frontal zone for this
region, as it moves slowly eastward over ND and north-central SD
before likely stalling around midday.

...Eastern Carolinas...
A zone of enhanced low-level gradient flow is apparent north through
northeast of the center of PTC 8, over coastal sections of NC and
westward past MYR.  This is related both to the cyclone itself and 
antecedent/post-frontal high pressure from north of the baroclinic
zone upon which this low developed.  The synoptically driven
baroclinicity is expected to continue to decrease (frontolysis),
especially if this low becomes tropical.  However, some mesoscale
baroclinicity will remain due to persistent rain north of the old
front, and a lack of precip -- combined with a high-theta-e,
maritime/tropical airmass to its south and southeast.  

This airmass should shift northward as the low moves inland, and
support potential for inland penetration of enough moisture and
limited diurnal heating to enable 500-1000 J/kg MLCAPE today, away
from areas of continual/persistent rainfall.  In an environment
where LCLs are low and low-level shear and SRH already are favorable
(per VWP from ILM and MHX), the tornado threat will be tied directly
to a combination of
1. Sufficient surface-based destabilization on the mesobeta scale,
in that transition zone where flow still is backed enough to keep
hodographs large, and
2. Formation of supercell(s) and their ability to remain in the
favorably buoyant/backed-flow slot long enough to mature and
produce.

See SPC mesoscale discussion 2070 for marginal, near-term potential
near and north of center.  Through the day, the effective warm-
frontal regime is expected to shift northward up the coastline and,
to some extent, areas around the Sounds, so a small unconditional
5%/"slight risk" has been introduced in those areas.  Tonight into
tomorrow morning, as the center penetrates deeper inland away from
the most favorable airmass and weakens considerably, and as diabatic
cooling reduces instability at the surface, the tornado potential
should diminish.

...Northern Plains...
A large area of precip and convection is ongoing across much of
west-central/central and northeastern ND, with embedded strong/
isolated severe thunderstorms capable of gusts and hail.  This
activity is reinforcing/reorienting the antecedent baroclinic zone
across the area, and may persist northeastward into the remainder of
northeastern ND and northwestern MN through midday with a continued
threat for isolated severe.  Additional development is possible
along the outflow-modulated boundary, both in the near term and
through the afternoon, ahead of the shortwave trough, and in the
area of related maximized lift (both convective-scale on the
boundary, and broader-scale in the midlevel DCVA).  

The airmass south and east of the boundary should heat diurnally,
steepening the low/middle-level lapse rates amidst favorable 60 F
surface dewpoints.  This should support peak/preconvective MLCAPE in
the 1500-2500 J/kg range, along with veering flow with height. 
However, lack of stronger midlevel flow limits deep shear, keeping
progged effective-shear magnitudes generally under 35 kt.  The most
probable convective mode appears to be a mix of multicells and messy
supercells.  Convection-allowing progs that most-closely depicted
the current state (which has not included the underdone hourly HRRR
for most of the night) reasonably show a lack of substantial
destabilization north of the boundary, except perhaps for some
elevated hail potential this evening.  Convective coverage on ether
side of the boundary may increase for a few hours this evening in
response to enhancement of moisture, shear and storm-relative flow
provides by the LLJ. 

...4 Corners/Great Basin...
A broad arc of combined baroclinic and large-scale ascent is
expected to extend across the near-eastern to far-southeastern
sectors of the mid/upper cyclone, supporting episodic, widely
scattered to scattered thunderstorms throughout much of the period. 
Where this activity encounters diurnally/diabatically destabilized
boundary layers, characterized by deep mixing with related
maximization of lapse rates and DCAPE, and at least marginal CAPE
above, isolated severe gusts will be a threat.  The potential for
high-based supercells amidst greater shear to the southeast, across
the Four Corners area, suggest isolated severe hail also will be
possible there.

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR THE EASTERN
GREAT BASIN INTO THE FOUR CORNERS REGION...ND INTO NORTHWEST
MN...EASTERN NC AND VICINITY...

...SUMMARY...
On Monday, sporadic severe gusts and hail will be possible during
the afternoon to early evening across parts of the eastern Great
Basin to Four Corners. Isolated severe storms are possible over
eastern North Dakota into northwest Minnesota. Some tornado threat
may develop over eastern North Carolina and vicinity.

...Eastern Great Basin to the Four Corners...
A seasonably strong mid-level low initially near San Francisco Bay
Monday morning should move east during the day, before curling
northeast Monday night towards the NV/UT/ID border area. This will
occur in response to a strong mid-level jet translating through the
basal portion of the large-scale trough across the Desert Southwest
into the eastern Great Basin.

Convection will likely be ongoing at the start of the forecast
period near the midlevel low, and also farther east toward the Four
Corners region, within the warm/moist conveyor. Relatively strong
heating will be possible between these two regimes, from eastern NV
into parts of UT. While buoyancy will likely remain quite weak
within this warmer and more well-mixed regime, high-based convection
will be possible during the afternoon and evening as the midlevel
low approaches the region, with increasing meridional flow and a
deeply mixed boundary layer supporting isolated severe gusts.  

Farther southeast into eastern UT and the Four Corners vicinity,
increasing southwesterly flow aloft and strengthening deep-layer
shear will become conditionally supportive of organized convection.
Warmer midlevel temperatures may limit buoyancy to some extent,
though sufficient moisture will support afternoon MLCAPE of 500-1000
J/kg. A few supercells will be possible within this regime, with an
attendant threat of isolated severe gusts and hail. 

...Parts of ND into northern MN...
With the primary upper-level trough displaced well to the west,
deep-layer shear will remain weak across much of the Great Plains.
However, most guidance suggests an MCV will emanate out of central
High Plains convection on D1/Sunday and gradually progress northeast
towards the Red River Valley during the day on Monday. In
conjunction with a strengthening low-level jet, this MCV may help to
support relatively vigorous storm redevelopment within a moderately
unstable environment during the afternoon and evening. 

Stronger midlevel flow attendant to the MCV could support some storm
organization, and a couple supercells and/or stronger clusters will
be possible, with a threat of isolated hail and damaging wind.
Somewhat favorable low-level shear/SRH could also support a tornado
threat, if a surface-based supercell can be sustained. Uncertainty
remains regarding the strength/timing of any MCV moving across the
region, along with the most favored corridor for diurnal storm
development. 

...Eastern NC and vicinity...
Guidance generally suggests that an initially offshore surface low
will move northward or northwestward from later on D1/Sunday into
D2/Monday and D3/Tuesday, and eventually move inland across some
part of the Carolinas. However, uncertainty remains regarding the
timing, track, and intensity of this low, along with the extent to
which it acquires any tropical or subtropical characteristics. 

If a deepening low does move onshore, then a higher theta-e airmass
may move inland, accompanied by increasing low-level shear/SRH
along/north of the low track. While the general scenario supports
some potential for low-topped supercells, the magnitude of any
tornado threat will be dependent on the extent of intensification
that occurs with the low (and its attendant wind fields) prior to
landfall. The Marginal Risk has been expanded somewhat across
eastern NC and vicinity, in response to the various uncertainties.

Valid 151630Z - 161200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE NORTHERN/CENTRAL PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms capable of producing isolated severe gusts and hail
may occur today and tonight across parts of the northern/central
Plains.

...Northern/Central Plains...
An amplified upper trough along/near the West Coast this morning
will further evolve into a closed upper low over northern CA and
vicinity by late tonight. Ahead of this feature, modestly enhanced
south-southwesterly mid-level flow will be in place over much of the
western states and Rockies through the period. Although low-level
moisture is expected to remain limited over much of this region,
isolated strong to severe gusts may occur with any thunderstorms
that can develop in a deeply mixed boundary layer favorable for
gusty downdraft winds. 

Latest guidance continues to suggest that a relatively greater
concentration of severe potential will be focused across parts of
the northern/central Plains late this afternoon through tonight.
Across this area, a weak surface lee trough and greater low-level
moisture to its east should support weak to moderate instability
with daytime heating. Steep mid-level lapse rates should also aid
updraft accelerations/intensities, with around 20-30 kt of
deep-layer shear supporting modest thunderstorm organization.
Isolated severe hail may occur with initially more discrete
convection, but a tendency for clustering should lead to a
relatively greater wind threat with time as convection spreads
generally east-northeastward through the evening. Regardless, the
overall severe threat from northeast CO into western NE/SD and
vicinity should remain fairly isolated/marginal given the modest
deep-layer shear.

Low-level warm advection is forecast to increase across much of the
northern/central Plains tonight as a southerly low-level jet
strengthens. A surface warm front is also expected to lift northward
over ND late tonight into early Monday morning. With steepening
mid-level lapse rates overspreading the northern Plains in tandem
with increasing low-level moisture, ample MUCAPE should be
available. Most guidance shows at least isolated convection
developing across parts of ND tonight in this favorable
thermodynamic environment. Although deep-layer shear may remain
fairly modest, it may still be sufficient for updraft organization
and an isolated threat for severe hail with any elevated convection
that can form. Have therefore expanded the Marginal Risk northward
to account for this potential.

...Coastal Carolinas...
Latest NHC forecast continues to indicate some potential for
sub-tropical or tropical development of a surface low currently off
the SC Coast. Regardless of development, it still appears that the
more moist/tropical low-level airmass over the Gulf Stream will
struggle to advance inland over coastal portions of NC/SC through
the end of the Day 1 forecast period early Monday morning (16/12Z).
Accordingly, tornado potential with any low-topped supercells on the
north to northeast periphery of the surface low should tend to
remain offshore until Day 2/Monday (after 16/12Z).

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1059 AM CDT Sun Sep 15 2024

Valid 151700Z - 161200Z

The previous forecast remains on track, with minor changes made to
the Elevated areas to reflect the latest guidance consensus.
Additionally, a couple of dry strikes may accompany isolated
thunderstorms along the Front Range in eastern Colorado (and
surrounding areas), but overall modest fuel receptiveness suggests
that lightning-induced fire ignitions should remain a localized
concern, so no isolated dry thunderstorm highlights have been added.

..Squitieri.. 09/15/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0150 AM CDT Sun Sep 15 2024/

...Synopsis...
Preceding an amplifying large-scale trough over the West Coast,
enhanced deep-layer meridional flow will overspread the Great Basin,
while a related surface cyclone evolves over northern NV. Deep
boundary-layer mixing into the enhanced flow aloft, along with a
tightening pressure gradient peripheral to the surface cyclone, will
yield 20-25 mph sustained southerly surface winds and 15-20 percent
RH over southern/central NV. Given modestly receptive fuels here,
elevated fire-weather conditions are expected during the afternoon. 

Additionally, large-scale ascent accompanying the amplifying
midlevel trough will promote a mix of wet/dry thunderstorms across
the northern Great Basin/Intermountain West. While quick storm
motions and limited precipitation with some of this activity could
yield a risk of lightning-induced ignitions, marginal fuels should
generally limit the threat. 

Over the southern High Plains, breezy/gusty southerly surface winds
will develop amid a warm/dry boundary layer near a lee trough during
the afternoon. This will favor a few hours of elevated fire-weather
conditions.

Post-Tropical Cyclone Ileana Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092024
800 AM MST Sun Sep 15 2024
 
Ileana has been devoid of deep convection since yesterday afternoon, 
as the system has been within a strong wind shear and very dry 
environment. Given the lack of convection, the system is being 
designated as a post-tropical remnant low.  An ASCAT-C pass from 
late last night depicted winds near 30 kt over the Gulf of 
California near northern Sinaloa.  Given this, will hold the 
intensity at 30 kt for this advisory, although that may be generous.
 
The system has been meandering over the Gulf of California with a 
motion of 310/3 kt.  The remnant low will increase forward speed 
later today as it continues northwestward.  The remnant low will 
continue to weaken throughout the day, and is forecast to dissipate 
on Monday. 

This is the last advisory on this system. For additional 
information on the remnant low please see High Seas Forecasts issued 
by the National Weather Service, under AWIPS header NFDHSFEPI, WMO 
header FZPN02 KWBC, and on the web at
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFEPI.php
