Mesoscale Discussion 1779
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0329 PM CDT Fri Jul 25 2025

Areas affected...eastern Pennsylvania...New Jersey...Long Island

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 542...

Valid 252029Z - 252200Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 542
continues.

SUMMARY...Potential for localized severe gusts remains across the
watch area.

DISCUSSION...Cluster of storms currently extend from coastal MA/RI
across Long Island and into eastern PA, with generally fast movement
to the southeast. A few storms have clearly reached severe levels,
with a 55 kt gust recently measured at Newark Airport. Additional
severe gusts may occur across the remainder of the warm sector over
land from southeast PA into much of NJ and across parts of Long
Island. Little to no additional severe storms are expected behind
the initial activity as due to drying aloft.

Mesoscale Discussion 1778
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0309 PM CDT Fri Jul 25 2025

Areas affected...portions of eastern Kansas and northwestern
Missouri

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 252009Z - 252215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...A few damaging gusts and a few brief tornadoes are
possible this afternoon across parts of eastern Kansas and
northwestern Missouri. A watch may be needed.

DISCUSSION...An MCV is currently situated over north central Kansas,
with an outflow/differential heating boundary across parts of
southeastern Kansas. Due to daytime heating, particularly south of
the boundary, along with surface dewpoints generally in the low to
mid 70s F, inhibition has been removed across the region. There is
some enhanced flow aloft round the MCV, which has provided ~30 kts
of effective bulk shear. Low-level shear is generally fairly weak,
though there is some enhancement in the weak easterly flow north of
the differential heating boundary. Given modest deep-layer shear,
multicell clusters with transient supercells are possible through
the afternoon, and any supercells would carry a risk of a brief
tornado, particularly where low-level shear is locally enhanced.
However, overall weak low-level flow and poor lapse rates may limit
the tornado threat. In addition, the atmosphere is quite moist, and
the water loading in downdrafts may lead to a risk for damaging
gusts as cell cluster with time. Trends are being monitored for a
possible watch.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0257 PM CDT Fri Jul 25 2025

Valid 252000Z - 261200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
NORTHEAST AND MID ATLANTIC...PARTS OF THE MID MISSOURI VALLEY...AND
ACROSS THE NORTHERN PLAINS....

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong to severe thunderstorms remain capable of damaging
wind gusts across parts of New England and the northern Mid-Atlantic
States this afternoon/evening. Severe storms will also be possible
across much of North Dakota as well as eastern Kansas into western
Missouri.

...20z Update Northeast...
Scattered to numerous thunderstorms ongoing ahead of a weak cold
front across the Northeast and northern Mid Atlantic states will
continue to pose a risk for isolated damaging gusts through this
evening. The main focus for storm development/intensification along
the front will continue to shift southeastward this afternoon.
Trimming was done to the MRGL area mainly where the wind shift has
already moved offshore. Otherwise the SLGT risk area was adjusted to
better match the higher storm coverage and threat for damaging
gusts.

...KS/MO...
To the west, scattered severe storms should continue to
develop/intensify this afternoon ahead of an MCV/shortwave trough
across parts of KS and MO. Very moist surface conditions are present
with mid 70s F dewpoints contributing to moderate destabilization
despite weak low and mid-level lapse rates. Enhanced mid-level wind
fields observed by area VADs should support a few stronger storms
including supercells capable of damaging gusts and possibly brief
tornadoes this afternoon and evening.

...Great Basin...
Isolated to scattered high-based thunderstorms remain likely across
northern CA and western NV this evening. Steep low-level lapse rates
will favor dry microburst potential with these storms or any more
persistent clusters of storms able to evolve. Have adjusted the MRGL
risk slightly west to better capture storms developing near the
higher terrain.

Otherwise, see the previous discussion for additional information.

..Lyons.. 07/25/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1142 AM CDT Fri Jul 25 2025/

...Northeast/Mid-Atlantic States...
Midday vapor imagery shows a fast-moving shortwave trough
progressing eastward into Quebec. An associated cold front will move
south-southeastward across New England this afternoon. Relatively
hot/humid conditions ahead of the front will lead to widely
scattered afternoon thunderstorms across southern New England and
eastern portions of New York/Pennsylvania. These storms will track
southeastward toward the coast through the early evening with
damaging winds possible.

...Northern Plains including North Dakota...
An upper ridge remains centered over the central Plains, with a weak
southern-stream trough currently moving across Utah into Wyoming.
Weak lift and increased mid-level moisture ahead of the system will
aid in the development of scattered thunderstorms by late afternoon
across parts of eastern Montana and northeast Wyoming. Thermodynamic
parameters are favorable for large hail in the stronger cells. It
seems that these storms will tend to persist east-northeastward this
evening and pose a risk of hail and locally damaging winds across
North Dakota.

...Eastern Kansas/western Missouri...
Regional WSR-88D VWP data continues to sample modestly enhanced
low/mid-tropospheric flow in relation to a slow-moving MCV, notable
from KEAX where 35-40 kt west-southwesterly flow persists between
3-5 km AGL. With a very moist air mass in place (low to middle 70s F
surface dewpoints), intensifying storms could include supercells
given some likely persistence of the enhanced flow field. Especially
with a convectively reinforced surface boundary, a semi-focused
corridor of damaging winds and brief tornado potential could evolve
this afternoon into early evening.

...Northern California/western Nevada...
Aside from the dry thunderstorm potential (see Fire Weather Day 1
Outlook), sufficient moisture/buoyancy may exist on the eastern and
northern periphery of the slow-moving upper low, where mid-level
temperatures (-12C at 500mb) are semi-cool, to allow for some hail
and/or convectively enhanced wind gusts this afternoon through
around sunset.

Valid 261200Z - 271200Z

...Update...
The Isolated Dry Thunderstorm area and Elevated area for dry and
windy conditions were expanded for Saturday. The latest hi-res
trends and forecast soundings suggest more coverage of high based
convection will accompany the slow moving shortwave trough
traversing CA. A small area of Scattered Dry Thunderstorms was
considered for northern NV, where QPF output may generally remain
below 0.25" over receptive fuels. However, given the weak steering
flow expected with the thunderstorms it was not included for the
time being. Farther south across portions of the Southwest and
central Rockies, a deeply mixed boundary layer will promote momentum
transfer of stronger flow aloft. Sustained wind speeds may exceed
20-25 mph for a few locations across portions of northwest AZ and
southwest UT, where very dry mid to lower tropospheric profiles are
expected atop receptive fuels. A Critical area was considered for
these regions, but the extent and duration of the higher wind speeds
precludes the need for an upgrade at this time.

..Barnes.. 07/25/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0145 AM CDT Fri Jul 25 2025/

...Synopsis...
An upper ridge will remain in place from the Great Plains eastward,
as a mid-level trough continues to meander over the Interior West
tomorrow (Saturday). During the day, multiple mid-level impulses
will traverse the upper trough and crest the ridge. One mid-level
impulse should graze the Great Basin, promoting enough upper support
for dry and windy conditions over the Four Corners. 15-20 mph
sustained southwesterly surface winds atop 10-20 percent RH and
receptive fuels warrants the introduction of Elevated highlights.
Furthermore, mid-level moisture will still linger over the northern
Great Basin toward the northern Rockies, which will be lifted by the
aforementioned mid-level impulse to support isolated to scattered
high-based thunderstorm development. A mix of dry and wet
thunderstorms will develop atop dry fuels, where ignition potential
will exist, hence the introduction of isolated dry thunderstorm
highlights.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THE EASTERN
DAKOTAS INTO PORTIONS OF THE UPPER MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY AND
ACROSS THE MID-ATLANTIC AND PORTIONS OF NEW ENGLAND...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are possible from the eastern Dakotas into the
Upper Mississippi Valley as well as across portions of the
Mid-Atlantic and New England region.

...Synopsis...
An upper ridge currently over the Southeast will gradually shift
west over the next 48-72 hours into the south-central U.S.
Strong/severe thunderstorm chances will largely be focused on the
north/northeastern periphery of the ridge as shortwave impulses
embedded within strong westerly mid-level flow overspread buoyant
air masses. 

...Eastern Dakotas into the Upper MS Valley...
Forecast confidence remains low for Sunday across the eastern
Dakotas into portions of the upper MS Valley. A low-amplitude
mid-level wave is forecast to round the apex of the mid-level ridge
through the afternoon/evening across ND/MN. A residual MCS from
overnight Saturday may accompany this wave, though the intensity of
this MCS by Sunday morning remains uncertain. However, this will
have a direct impact on thunderstorm development/evolution Sunday
afternoon. Several deterministic solutions (most notably recent NAM
and ECMWF runs) suggest either a re-intensification of the MCS
and/or new convective development along an outflow boundary across
MN by late afternoon. Given forecast MLCAPE of 3000-4000 J/kg and
30-40 knots of deep-layer wind shear, this activity could strengthen
into a well-organized, severe MCS through the late evening hours as
it propagates southeastward along a warm frontal zone into parts of
IA and/or WI. Other solutions, including the high-res RRFS, depict a
weaker early-morning MCS and more limited thunderstorm coverage
through late evening. Ensemble guidance shows similarly dichotomous
solutions. Severe risk probabilities were maintained as-is given
then spread in solutions, but higher risk highlights will likely be
needed if guidance begins to coalesce around the NAM/ECMWF
solutions.

...Mid-Atlantic into parts of New England...
A weak surface trough/cold front is forecast to push eastward across
the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic region through peak heating. A moist air
mass will likely remain in place through the weekend and will
promote widespread MLCAPE values of at least 1000 J/kg along with
limited capping. West/northwesterly flow aloft coupled with modest
low-level winds should support adequate deep-layer wind shear for a
few strong/severe thunderstorms as convection develops by mid/late
afternoon.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS PORTIONS OF THE
NORTHERN ROCKIES...CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS AND THE DAKOTAS AS WELL AS
THE MIDWEST INTO THE MID-ATLANTIC...

...SUMMARY...
Strong to severe thunderstorms accompanied by potentially damaging
wind gusts are possible Saturday afternoon/evening in parts of the
Upper Midwest/Lower Great Lakes into portions of the Mid-Atlantic.
Isolated to widely scattered severe storms are also likely across
the Northern Rockies, central High Plains, and northern Plains.

...Synopsis...
The overall synoptic regime will largely remain in place over the
next 48 hours across the country, characterized by a persistent
upper ridge over the Southeast with longwave troughing west of the
Rockies. A diffuse frontal zone draped from the upper OH Valley into
the central Plains this morning should largely remain in place
across the upper Midwest/Great Lakes region and will act as a foci
for thunderstorm development through the afternoon. To the west, a
low-amplitude impulse currently off the coast of southwest CA will
propagate into the central Rockies/High Plains around peak heating.
This will support isolated to scattered thunderstorm development
that may persist into the overnight hours across the northern
Plains.

...Eastern North Dakota...
Two rounds of severe thunderstorms appear possible across eastern ND
and far northwest MN tomorrow afternoon and overnight. A weak
surface front emanating out of the southern Canadian prairies will
impinge on the northern edge of a plume of 70-75 dewpoints as it
moves into northeast ND and far northwest MN. Steep mid-level lapse
rates advecting into the region coupled with rich low-level moisture
should support 3000-4000 J/kg MLCAPE by late afternoon. 30-40 knot
mid-level flow will provide adequate deep-layer wind shear for
organized storms, including the potential for a few supercells
capable of large hail and severe winds. Increasing capping with
southward extent should limit the spatial extent of this threat.
Morning guidance hints at the passage of an MCS across the Dakotas
overnight as a result of upscale growth of convection over the High
Plains. Given the steep lapse rates in place upstream per 12z RAOBS
and the passage of weak mid-level wave during the overnight period,
this scenario appears plausible. However, deterministic solutions
vary regarding the intensity of the potential MCS, and nocturnal
cooling coupled with warm 850-700 mb temperatures at the base of the
EML cast uncertainty onto how intense surface winds will be. Higher
risk probabilities may be needed for either of these scenarios as
forecast uncertainty become resolved. 

...Northern Rockies into the Northern/Central High Plains...
An upper-level impulse currently off the southern CA coast is
forecast to phase favorably with peak heating over the northern
Rockies/central High Plains. This will promote thunderstorm
development within the higher terrain of southern MT and northern WY
and along a surface trough draped across the western Plains by late
afternoon. Strong daytime heating under a plume of steep mid-level
lapse rates and on the western fringe of a low-level moisture plume
will result in deeply mixed profiles with around 500-1000 J/kg
MLCAPE. Moderate mid-level flow within the CAPE-bearing layer may
support adequate deep-layer shear for a supercell or two across
MT/northern WY, but weaker shear with southward extent will limit
storm organization/longevity. Regardless, thermodynamic profiles
will be very favorable for strong to severe downburst winds. 

...Midwest to Mid-Atlantic...
A weak mid-level impulse/MCV emanating out of the Plains will
promote scattered showers and weak thunderstorms across the Midwest
at the start of the forecast period. Lingering showers and clouds
casts some uncertainty regarding diurnal heating/destabilization,
but rich boundary-layer moisture already in place will likely
support MLCAPE values upwards of at least 2000 J/kg by late
afternoon. Areas along the composite frontal zone that can
destabilize will likely see thunderstorm development by
mid-afternoon as the MCV propagates east across the Midwest/Great
Lakes. Augmented mid-level winds attendant to this feature will
support 0-6 km bulk shear values on the order of 20-30 knots, which
in conjunction with mean flow along the boundary, should promote a
mix of semi-discrete cells and loosely organized clusters capable of
damaging to severe winds and perhaps large hail. 

Further east across southern PA into the Mid-Atlantic, thunderstorm
development is anticipated by mid to late afternoon both within the
central Appalachians and along a diffuse frontal zone. Despite weak
mid-level lapse rates, rich low-level moisture should support
widespread MLCAPE values of around 1500 J/kg with minimal capping.
Easterly low-level winds under northwesterly mid-level flow will
provide sufficient hodograph elongation for organized cells/clusters
with an attendant threat for damaging/severe winds.

1142 AM CDT Fri Jul 25 2025

Valid 251630Z - 261200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
NORTHEAST...NORTHERN PLAINS...AND PARTS OF EASTERN KANSAS/WESTERN
MISSOURI...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong to severe thunderstorms will pose a risk of
damaging wind gusts across parts of New England and the northern
Mid-Atlantic States this afternoon. Severe storms will also be
possible across much of North Dakota as well as eastern Kansas into
western Missouri.

...Northeast/Mid-Atlantic States...
Midday vapor imagery shows a fast-moving shortwave trough
progressing eastward into Quebec. An associated cold front will move
south-southeastward across New England this afternoon. Relatively
hot/humid conditions ahead of the front will lead to widely
scattered afternoon thunderstorms across southern New England and
eastern portions of New York/Pennsylvania. These storms will track
southeastward toward the coast through the early evening with
damaging winds possible.

...Northern Plains including North Dakota...
An upper ridge remains centered over the central Plains, with a weak
southern-stream trough currently moving across Utah into Wyoming.
Weak lift and increased mid-level moisture ahead of the system will
aid in the development of scattered thunderstorms by late afternoon
across parts of eastern Montana and northeast Wyoming. Thermodynamic
parameters are favorable for large hail in the stronger cells. It
seems that these storms will tend to persist east-northeastward this
evening and pose a risk of hail and locally damaging winds across
North Dakota.

...Eastern Kansas/western Missouri...
Regional WSR-88D VWP data continues to sample modestly enhanced
low/mid-tropospheric flow in relation to a slow-moving MCV, notable
from KEAX where 35-40 kt west-southwesterly flow persists between
3-5 km AGL. With a very moist air mass in place (low to middle 70s F
surface dewpoints), intensifying storms could include supercells
given some likely persistence of the enhanced flow field. Especially
with a convectively reinforced surface boundary, a semi-focused
corridor of damaging winds and brief tornado potential could evolve
this afternoon into early evening.

...Northern California/western Nevada...
Aside from the dry thunderstorm potential (see Fire Weather Day 1
Outlook), sufficient moisture/buoyancy may exist on the eastern and
northern periphery of the slow-moving upper low, where mid-level
temperatures (-12C at 500mb) are semi-cool, to allow for some hail
and/or convectively enhanced wind gusts this afternoon through
around sunset.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0143 AM CDT Fri Jul 25 2025/

...Synopsis...
An upper ridge will prevail over the central and eastern U.S. while
an upper trough lingers over the Interior West today. Adequate lift
ahead of the upper trough amid appreciable mid-level moisture and
buoyancy will support isolated to scattered thunderstorm development
over the Sierra toward the Northern Rockies by the afternoon.
Forecast soundings in this region depict inverted-v profiles, with
0.25-0.75 inch PWATs, promoting a mix of wet and dry high-based
thunderstorms. Given dry fuels in the region, isolated dry
thunderstorm highlights seem necessary.

0355 AM CDT Fri Jul 25 2025

Valid 281200Z - 021200Z

...DISCUSSION...
The strongest mid-level flow will move from the Upper Midwest into
the Northeast this weekend into the middle of next week. As this
occurs, a surface boundary will slowly sag into the central Plains
and Ohio Valley. Given the very moist airmass to the south of the
boundary, strong to potentially severe storms are possible along the
boundary at least into the middle of next week. With the stronger
flow/shear displace north of the boundary and model differences in
the location, uncertainty remains too high for highlights.

Farther west, moisture will be pushed up against parts of the
northern Rockies and adjacent High Plains. Between the terrain and
shortwave troughs moving through the central U.S. ridge, it is
possible strong to severe storms could develop and progress along
the surface boundary into greater areas of moisture/buoyancy in the
Plains. Given the dependency on the low-predictability shortwaves,
it is not clear where the greatest risk will be from the High Plains
into the Plains through the middle of next week.

By the end of next week, model guidance suggests a general trend of
continued upper ridge building into Plains. Stronger mid-level winds
will remain in parts of the Northeast with additional shortwave
perturbations moving through parts of the northern Rockies. Severe
risk along the boundary should decrease as it becomes further
removed from the stronger flow. Though predictability is low
regarding the shortwave troughs, some severe risk could develop in
parts of the northern Rockies.

Mesoscale Discussion 1773

0308 PM CDT Thu Jul 24 2025

Areas affected...portions of eastern KS into northwest MO

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 242008Z - 242215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated strong wind gusts are possible the remainder of
the afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorms have gradually increased in intensity
this afternoon amid a very moist and moderately unstable airmass.
Vertical shear will remain modest, with effective shear magnitude
only expected to be around 20 kt. Nevertheless, strong instability
and high PW values near 2 inches could support isolated wet
microbursts within this weakly sheared environment. North and east
extent of strong/severe potential may remain somewhat limited due to
early day convection and lingering cloud cover across northern MO.
Weak inhibition remains over this area and instability is somewhat
less. At this time, the overall threat appears limited/transient and
a severe thunderstorm watch is not currently expected.

0241 PM CDT Thu Jul 24 2025

Areas affected...parts of eastern Wyoming and northern Colorado

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 241941Z - 242145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Storms may produce a few instance of large hail and a few
severe gusts across portions of eastern Wyoming and northern
Colorado. A watch is not anticipated.

DISCUSSION...Convection has developed along the mountains across
parts of eastern Wyoming and northern Colorado, where diurnal
inhibition has eroded. Farther east across the High Plains, some
inhibition remains for mixed-layer parcels, but additional heating
should continue to erode the MLCINH as the afternoon progresses.
Kinematically, the region is on the southern periphery of a modest
mid-level jet. This should provide sufficient shear for at least
transient supercells, and in some places low-level wind profiles
favor left-moving supercells. Given the long hodographs and steep
lapse rates with low freezing levels, some hail is possible with the
strongest storms. Shear decreases with southward extent, so this may
put a limit on the southern extent of the hail risk. With time,
storms may begin to cluster, and these clusters may also produce a
risk for severe gusts given the relatively dry boundary layer and
steep low-level lapse rates. Given the expected sparse coverage of
severe weather, a watch is not anticipated.

Mesoscale Discussion 1771
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0210 PM CDT Thu Jul 24 2025

Areas affected...portions of northern IL/IN into southern Lower MI

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 241910Z - 242115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated strong to severe wind gusts are possible this
afternoon into early evening across portions of northeast Illinois,
northern Indiana, and southern Lower Michigan.

DISCUSSION...Isolated thunderstorms are developing across northeast
IL as of 19z ahead of surface boundary moving slowly southeastward.
Ahead of the boundary and initial thunderstorm development, strong
heating into the low 90s, with dewpoints in the mid/upper 70s, is
resulting in a corridor of moderate/strong instability (MLCAPE up to
3000 J/kg). Deep shear will remain weak across the region, but
effective shear magnitudes around 20-30 kt may be sufficient for a
few organized cells/clusters. Modified RAP forecast soundings show
large instability, with steep low-level lapse rates from 7-8 C/km in
the 0-3 km layer. Given the very moist and strongly unstable
airmass, isolated downbursts producing strong to severe gusts are
possible through the afternoon into early evening. 

Some uncertainty remains regarding storm coverage, especially given
veering low-level flow, reducing convergence/lift along the surface
boundary. Nevertheless, any storm that does develop could produce
locally damaging gusts. A severe thunderstorm watch may be needed at
some point this afternoon.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0730 AM CDT Thu Jul 24 2025

Valid 241300Z - 251200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM PARTS OF
THE GREAT LAKES INTO THE MIDWEST...CENTRAL/SOUTHERN PLAINS...AND
HIGH PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Locally damaging thunderstorm wind gusts will be possible from parts
of the Great Lakes to the central and southern Plains, mainly this
afternoon and evening. Isolated severe storms will also pose a risk
of hail and severe wind gusts over portions of the northern and
central High Plains.

...Synopsis...
Modestly enhanced westerly mid-level flow will be maintained today
between an upper trough progressing slowly eastward over central
Canada and the north-central CONUS, and upper ridging across the
Southeast and Mid-Atlantic. Multiple mid-level MCVs evident on
satellite and radar should move generally east-northeastward across
parts of the Midwest and Great Lakes today. At the surface, a
convectively reinforced front will be draped from Ontario/Quebec
southwestward to the southern Plains. This front will likely serve
as a focused for additional scattered to numerous thunderstorms this
afternoon and evening, some of which could become strong to severe
on an isolated basis.

...Great Lakes into the Midwest and Central/Southern Plains...
A moist and rather unstable airmass will exist along/ahead of the
front today, as diurnal heating aids in the gradual steepening of
low-level lapse rates. Stronger mid-level flow and related
deep-layer shear should be present across parts of MI and vicinity.
Some enhancement to the low/mid-level winds and modest ascent
associated with an MCV over northeast WI this morning may also aid
in thunderstorm development and organization downstream into parts
of northern Lower MI by early afternoon. This area appears to have
the best combination of forecast instability and shear, and any
thunderstorms which can form here could become severe while posing a
threat for both isolated hail and damaging winds. However, low-level
flow along/near the front is generally expected to remain veered to
southwesterly, which should limit low-level convergence to some
extent. Therefore, confidence in overall coverage of severe
convection remains too low to include greater severe probabilities
across northern Lower MI at this time.

Mid-level flow and effective bulk shear values will decrease with
southward extent across the Midwest into the southern Plains, away
from any remnant MCV influences. This should tend to limit updraft
organization with thunderstorms that develop this afternoon across
these regions. Still, some potential should exist for loosely
organized clusters given the linear low-level forcing. And with
steep low-level lapse rates and moderate to strong instability, some
of this convection may be capable of producing strong to locally
severe winds through the early evening hours before eventually
weakening with the loss of daytime heating.

...High Plains...
Moderate instability should develop across parts of the
northern/central High Plains this afternoon. Large-scale ascent will
be weak behind a departing mid-level shortwave trough. Even so,
convective development should occur near the adjacent higher terrain
this afternoon. Effective shear of 25-40 kt will support some
updraft organization. Initially discrete cells may pose an isolated
threat for hail. Some outflow amalgamation/mergers could eventually
occur, with a threat of strong to locally severe gusts spreading
eastward into the evening before convection eventually weakens.
Farther south across portions of the southern High Plains, scattered
to numerous thunderstorms are also expected to develop this
afternoon/early evening. Deep-layer shear will remain weak across
this region, but localized strong to severe outflow gusts may still
be possible.

Mesoscale Discussion 1764
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0343 PM CDT Wed Jul 23 2025

Areas affected...parts of northeastern Colorado...southeast
Wyoming...and far western Nebraska

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 232043Z - 232245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Storms may produce a few severe gusts and some marginally
severe hail across parts of northeastern Colorado, southeast
Wyoming, and far western Nebraska this afternoon. A watch is not
anticipated.

DISCUSSION...Mid-level clouds from morning convection have been slow
to clear portions of northeastern Colorado, and so heating has been
delayed, which has led to some residual inhibition. Despite this, a
narrow corridor of heating along the mountains has allowed storms to
percolate along the Front Range this afternoon in a post-frontal
upslope flow regime. These storms are well south of the strongest
mid-level flow, and therefore deep-layer shear is relatively weak.
Because of this, multicell clusters are expected to be the dominant
storm mode. In addition, the environment has some mid-level dry air
and steep lapse rates, which may lead to a threat for severe gusts
with the strongest clusters. Some hail is possible with these storms
given low freezing levels, but the lack of deep-layer shear and the
multicell storm mode may limit the severe hail risk with these
storms.

Mesoscale Discussion 1763

0254 PM CDT Wed Jul 23 2025

Areas affected...portions of southeast MN into north-central WI

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 231954Z - 232200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Intensifying thunderstorms may pose a risk of damaging
wind gusts across southeast Minnesota into portions of
northern/central Wisconsin the next few hours. Area is being
monitored for possible watch issuance.

DISCUSSION...Isolated to scattered thunderstorms are
developing/intensifying this afternoon along/just ahead of the
southward-advancing cold front. This activity is tracking along a
differential heating zone and within the strong instability gradient
oriented across north-central WI. Strong heating ahead of these
storms and dewpoints in the mid 70s have allowed inhibition to
weaken. This area is on the edges of more favorable deep shear, but
20-30 kt effective shear magnitudes may be sufficient for organized
clusters/small bows given strong instability. Modified RAP forecast
soundings and regional VWP data show somewhat small but favorably
curved low-level hodographs. Low-level shear will remain modest, but
given the very moist and unstable boundary layer, a tornado or two
also could occur, in addition to damaging wind gusts. This area is
being monitored for possible watch issuance.

Mesoscale Discussion 1762
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK

Areas affected...parts of eastern Wyoming...southeastern Montana.
western South Dakota...and far northwestern Nebraska

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 231911Z - 232115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Storms with a risk of large hail and severe gusts are
possible this afternoon across portions of eastern Wyoming,
southeastern Montana, western South Dakota, and northwestern
Nebraska. A watch may be needed to cover this threat.

DISCUSSION...Storms are developing in a post-frontal upslope flow
regime in northern and eastern Wyoming. These storms are situated on
the southern periphery of a modest mid-level jet. This flow should
provide sufficient deep-layer shear for a supercell storm mode, and
given the relatively straight hodographs and lower freezing levels,
some severe hail is possible initially with these storms. The
deep-layer shear decreases markedly with southward extent, so this
may put a limit on the southern extent of the hail risk.

Given relatively high boundary layer humidity, cold pools may be
weaker, and therefore upscale growth may be slow to occur. However,
some clustering of storms is expected with time. This would
transition the primary threat to severe gusts given the relatively
steep low-level lapse rates and modest flow aloft on the regional
RAP short-term forecast profiles.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 538
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
135 PM MDT Wed Jul 23 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Western South Dakota
  Central into Northeast Wyoming

* Effective this Wednesday afternoon and evening from 135 PM
  until 800 PM MDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2
    inches in diameter possible
  Isolated damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...Widely scattered to scattered thunderstorms are forecast
to develop this afternoon.  The stronger storms will likely become
supercells and pose a risk for large hail (1 to 2 inches in
diameter).  Isolated severe gusts (60-70 mph) are possible with
supercells and with storms that may congeal into a linear cluster
towards the evening.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 90
statute miles east and west of a line from 50 miles north northeast
of Gillette WY to 30 miles east southeast of Douglas WY. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU8).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 450. Mean storm motion vector
27020.

Mesoscale Discussion 1759
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0728 AM CDT Wed Jul 23 2025

Areas affected...eastern SD and western MN

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 231228Z - 231400Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Sporadic severe gusts may persist this morning with
multiple messy clusters across eastern South Dakota. Watch issuance
in the near-term is uncertain with increasing likelihood towards
midday.

DISCUSSION...A small but persistent cluster that has produced a
focused swath of measured severe gusts across southwest into central
SD has weakened in terms of reflectivity structure and IR cloud top
warming. The downstream front has oscillated southward, suggesting
that this cluster will persist to the cool side of this front and
likely impinge on weak downstream convection towards the SD/ND/MN
border area. Meanwhile, a west/east-oriented convective band
emanating northward across southern SD has produced a couple
measured severe gusts at mesonet sites. This convection will
probably evolve more northeastward into late morning and could also
congeal with the post-frontal convection to the north. Overall messy
and complex convective mode, along with the time of day, suggests
that severe potential may remain sporadic and disorganized. More
positive cold pool merging could occur into western MN towards
midday as greater downstream insolation occurs across
central/southern MN.

Mesoscale Discussion 1756
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0319 PM CDT Tue Jul 22 2025

Areas affected...portions of southeast North Dakota and northeast
South Dakota

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 222019Z - 222215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Strong to severe thunderstorms are possible into early
evening. Hail and strong gusts may occur with stronger storms.

DISCUSSION...Scattered thunderstorms have developed this afternoon
within the post-outflow airmass. While early day convection and
cloud cover have impacted the airmass to some degree, some recovery
is apparent as temperatures have warmed into the upper 70s to low
80s and dewpoints have been maintained in the upper 60s to low 70s.
As a result, capping is eroding, and MLCAPE has increased to
1000-2000 J/kg. Ongoing storms may be somewhat elevated initially,
but could become surface-based with time. Effective shear magnitudes
greater than 40 kt and steep midlevel lapse rates suggests robust
updrafts supporting isolated large hail and strong/severe gusts will
be possible. Given the influence of outflow and modification of the
airmass from morning convection, convective evolution remains
somewhat uncertain. Portions of the area may eventually need a
severe thunderstorm watch, but timing and location is uncertain.

Mesoscale Discussion 1755
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0300 PM CDT Tue Jul 22 2025

Areas affected...northern WY into southeast MT

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 222000Z - 222200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated strong to severe thunderstorms are possible
across parts of southern Montana and northern Wyoming this afternoon
and evening.

DISCUSSION...Occasionally robust thunderstorms have developed over
higher terrain in portions of southern MT and northern WY. Weak
inhibition remains downstream over the adjacent high Plains, but
additional heating and increasing ascent should allow for storms to
become sustained further from the terrain with time into late
afternoon. Regional VWP data shows elongated, straight hodographs
amid steep midlevel lapse rates. While instability is muted due to
the drier, post-frontal low-level airmass, MLCAPE will still be
sufficient to sustain updrafts. Isolated strong to severe
thunderstorms posing a risk for hail (possibly up to 2 inches,
especially over far southeast MT) will be possible over the next
several hours. Trends will be monitored and a severe thunderstorm
watch may be needed for parts of the discussion area later this
afternoon.

Mesoscale Discussion 1738
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0241 PM CDT Sun Jul 20 2025

Areas affected...south-central South Dakota across western Nebraska
and toward northwest Kansas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 201941Z - 202215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered severe storms appear likely later this afternoon
from south-central SD across west-central NE and toward northwest
KS. A few cells may produce large hail, with locally damaging gusts.
A tornado is possible over southern SD into far northern NE after
23Z. A portion of the area may require a watch.

DISCUSSION...Surface map shows low pressure extending from southwest
SD across western NE and into the CO/KS border area, with strong
heating. This trough will continue to deepen, and sufficient
convergence within the uncapped air mass should allow for widely
scattered storms to develop late this afternoon.

Of particular note is the warm front area which currently curls
northwestward out of northern NE and into south-central SD. Here,
heating is occurring on the cool side of the boundary, where
dewpoints remain above 70 F and low-level shear is enhanced. Any
supercell that develops here, most likely after 23Z, could be
tornadic at times, and produce very large hail as it proceeds
southeastward, aided by a modest evening low-level jet.

Farther south into the deeper/heated air mass, higher based storms
are expected, and overall shear is weaker as well. However, steep
lapse rates will favor locally severe gusts, and even some hail in
the early and robust formation stages.

Mesoscale Discussion 1737
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0135 PM CDT Sun Jul 20 2025

Areas affected...southern Indiana and Ohio...northern Kentucky

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 201835Z - 202130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...A few strong storms producing locally damaging gusts
cannot be ruled out later this afternoon from southern Indiana
across southern Ohio and northeast Kentucky.

DISCUSSION...An MCV continues to move rapidly eastward across
northern IN, well north of a stalled front draped across southern
IL/IN and southwest OH. Meanwhile, a very moist air mass remains
near this boundary, with heating occurring upstream across the Mid
MS and OH Valleys.

While the entire warm sector is unstable, areas near the front exist
beneath slightly stronger deep-layer mean winds, on the southern
periphery of the larger scale trough (and MCV) influence.

Visible imagery show increasing CU fields from southern IN into
northern and eastern KY, and scattered storms are likely within this
zone. Locally strong downbursts will be possible, but any more
substantial wind threat would be conditional on a large cluster of
storms producing outflow, and tracking east/southeast near the
boundary. At this time, it appears a watch will not be necessary.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 530
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
410 PM EDT Sun Jul 20 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Connecticut
  Massachusetts
  Far Southern Maine
  Southern New Hampshire
  Rhode Island
  Southern Vermont
  Coastal Waters

* Effective this Sunday afternoon and evening from 410 PM until
  900 PM EDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 65 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1 inch in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Scattered thunderstorms are forecast to continue to
develop and intensify and pose primarily a threat for strong to
severe gusts (55-65 mph).  Isolated large hail may accompany the
stronger cells.  This activity will likely reach the coast by the
mid evening.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 80
statute miles north and south of a line from 30 miles east northeast
of Boston MA to 25 miles south southwest of Pittsfield MA. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU0).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
1 inch. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 55 knots. A few
cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 400. Mean storm motion vector
28025.

Mesoscale Discussion 1735
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0735 AM CDT Sun Jul 20 2025

Areas affected...Portions of far east-central IL into central IN

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 201235Z - 201430Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...A small complex of thunderstorms may pose a gradually
increasing threat for damaging winds over the next few hours. Watch
issuance is possible later this morning if this activity can
intensify.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorms are ongoing this morning across parts of
central IL, aided by modest west-southwesterly low-level warm
advection and a low-amplitude mid-level perturbation. This
convection should continue to track generally east-southeastward
this morning across parts of central IN along an instability
gradient evident in latest mesoanalysis. While low/mid-level flow is
not overly strong, recent VWPs from KILX/KIND do show some
strengthening with height through mid levels. Resultant 25-30 kt of
effective bulk shear should continue to support some updraft
organization, with a recent supercell structure noted with a
thunderstorm near the IL/IN border. If a small bowing cluster can
become established as some recent high-resolution guidance suggests,
then a greater threat for scattered severe/damaging winds may be
realized across parts of central IN later this morning as the
boundary layer gradually destabilizes with filtered daytime heating.
While not immediately likely, Severe Thunderstorm Watch issuance may
eventually be needed if the ongoing activity can intensify.
