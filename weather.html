Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1049 AM CST Thu Nov 16 2023

Valid 171200Z - 181200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not forecast across the contiguous United
States on Friday.

...Synopsis...
The upper-air pattern on Friday will feature a deamplifying
mid-level trough over the Atlantic off the Southeast coast and a
mid-level trough moving east across the Great Lakes.  Farther west,
a mid-level ridge over the southern-central Rockies will be
downstream of a trough slowly encroaching on the CA coast by early
Saturday morning.  In the low levels, surface high pressure will
encompass much of the central US in wake of a cold front pushing
east across the OH/TN Valley into the Appalachians.  Showers are
possible over the coastal mountains of CA by the early evening
before additional showers and a few thunderstorms develop inland. 
Scant buoyancy will limit thunderstorm coverage/intensity across CA
and the lower CO River Valley.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook

1034 AM CST Thu Nov 16 2023

Valid 161700Z - 171200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The current D1 Fire Weather Outlook is on track with no updates
needed. See previous discussion below.

..Thornton.. 11/16/2023

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1239 AM CST Thu Nov 16 2023/

...Synopsis...
Fire weather potential will be limited today across the country.
Early-morning water-vapor imagery depicts an upper shortwave trough
traversing the U.S./Canadian border. Ahead of this feature, steady
surface pressure falls have been observed over the past 12 hours
across eastern MT and the Dakotas with a surface low beginning to
organize over the region. This low will continue to deepen and drift
east through the day as an attendant cold front (already noted over
northeast MT/northwest ND) sweeps to the south/southeast. Breezy
conditions are expected ahead of and behind the front with winds
gusting as high as 25-35 mph. However, the combination of moisture
advection ahead of the front and an influx of cooler temperatures
behind the front should modulate afternoon RH reductions. Localized
elevated conditions are possible in the immediate lee of the central
to southern Rockies (mainly from southeast CO to northeast NM),
where pre-frontal westerly downslope flow may support areas of 15-20
mph winds and RH values in the 20-30% range. Such conditions are
expected to be too transient and localized to warrant highlights.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR SOUTHEAST
PARTS OF THE FLORIDA PENINSULA...

...SUMMARY...
A few strong storms may threaten the southern and eastern Florida
Peninsula, and a brief tornado or damaging gust cannot be completely
ruled out.

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will traverse the Upper MS Valley as a second
mid-level trough meanders off of the CA coastline today. While
surface troughing across the MS/OH Valleys will encourage modest
moisture return, the surface airmass over most of the CONUS should
remain too cool or stable to support organized thunderstorm
potential. A renegade thunderstorm or two may occur across portions
of central CA and southern AZ in advance of the approaching trough
(and associated embedded mid-level impulses ejecting ahead of this
feature). However, very scant buoyancy and deep-layer ascent should
limit storm coverage to below 10 percent, hence the removal of
thunder lines in these areas. The main threat for organized
thunderstorms remains over the central and eastern FL Peninsula as a
surface low intensifies offshore over the Atlantic shoreline. 

...Southeastern Florida Peninsula...
A surface low is poised to intensify just offshore of the
southeastern FL Peninsula today, with 35+ kts of easterly 850 mb
flow expected to overspread some of the counties around and east of
Lake Okeechobee during the afternoon and evening hours. This
strengthening flow aloft will result in elongated hodographs with
some low-level curvature. Instability should be marginal though,
with 5.5-6.0 C/km mid-level lapse rates overspreading 68-70F surface
dewpoints, contributing to 800-1200 J/kg of tall and thin SBCAPE.
Latest guidance consensus depicts semi-discrete storms developing
along the northwestern periphery of the surface low across southeast
portions of the FL Peninsula this afternoon and evening. Given the
aforementioned CAPE/shear parameter space, it is not entirely out of
the question for one of the stronger storms to produce a damaging
gust or even a brief tornado, hence the introduction of Category
1/Marginal Risk probabilities this outlook.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0628 AM CST Thu Nov 16 2023

Valid 161300Z - 171200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
A few strong storms may threaten the southern and eastern Florida
Peninsula, but the bulk of the activity is expected to remain
offshore.

...Synopsis...
The mid/upper-level pattern over the western CONUS will continue to
be characterized by converging split flow in the Rockies region --
downstream from a cut-off synoptic cyclone over the Pacific.  That
cyclone will begin to move slowly eastward through the period, but
will remain well offshore until day 2.  An ejecting, deamplifying,
basal shortwave trough will cross the central CA coastal areas
around 00Z.  Forecast soundings suggest deep-enough buoyancy for
isolated coastal and inland thunder potential with convection
occupying a related swath of large-scale DCVA/lift and strongly
difluent mid/upper flow.  Isolated elevated thunderstorms also may
develop in a low-level warm/moist-advection swath farther southeast
from the lower Colorado River Valley across parts of AZ, but with
more marginal instability and somewhat weaker lift. 

A northern-stream trough initially was located from northwestern
Hudson Bay southwestward over MT.  This feature should amplify and
move eastward to northwestern ON, Lake Superior, the upper
Mississippi Valley, and the lower Missouri Valley by 12Z tomorrow. 
Downstream height falls will spread over much of the eastern CONUS. 
The southeastern periphery of those height falls will encourage a
continued slow eastward shift of a weaker, southern-stream,
mid/upper-level trough now apparent in moisture-channel imagery over
the eastern Gulf.  That trough should extend from just off the
JAX/DAB area southwestward across the peninsula near FMY by 12Z.  As
that occurs, a low-level cyclone -- its center now apparent in
satellite imagery near 26N89W -- will be left behind to continue
drifting southwestward and weakening gradually.

A quasistationary frontal zone extends from there roughly eastward
across parts of the Keys and Straits to another low -- apparent as
part of a prominent MCV on radar and satellite imagery near Bimini. 
Extensive convection has accompanied the eastern circulation --
which may pivot northward near the Gulf Stream today, but remaining
largely offshore.  Behind/southwest of it, several stable layers
aloft -- sampled by 12Z KEY/MFL soundings, should inhibit convective
potential over south FL.  Scattered showers and isolated
thunderstorms may occur in MCV-enhanced/deep low-level easterlies
farther north across central/eastern FL.  Adequate speed shear, but
little directional change in the easterly layer, will render modest,
somewhat hook-shaped low-level hodographs, beneath weak midlevel
southerlies/southwesterlies.  A few cells may exhibit weak rotation
inland, or produce strong gusts with downdrafts superimposed on the
ambient/gradient flow, but the greatest convective coverage and
intensity should be out to sea.

FL<br /> 700 AM EST Thu Nov 16 2023<br /> <br /> For the North
Atlantic…Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br /> <br /> 1.
West-Central Caribbean Sea (AL98):<br /> Showers and thunderstorms
associated with a broad area of low <br /> pressure located over the
west-central Caribbean Sea have become a <br /> little better organized
since yesterday. Environmental conditions <br /> appear conducive for
some additional development, and a tropical <br /> depression could form
over the next day or two while the low moves <br /> northeastward toward
Jamaica, Haiti, and eastern Cuba. An Air <br /> Force Reserve
reconnaissance aircraft is scheduled to investigate <br /> the system
this afternoon.<br /> <br /> Regardless of development, this system is
expected to produce heavy <br /> rains that could result in flash
flooding and mudslides over <br /> portions of the Greater Antilles
through this weekend. Interests <br /> in Jamaica, Cuba, Haiti, the
Dominican Republic, the southeastern <br /> Bahamas, and the Turks and
Caicos Islands should continue to monitor <br /> the progress of this
system. <br /> * Formation chance through 48 hours…medium…60
percent.<br /> * Formation chance through 7 days…medium…60
percent.<br /> <br /> 2. Offshore Southeast Coast of United
States:<br /> A non-tropical area of low pressure between southern
Florida and <br /> the northwestern Bahamas is associated with a frontal
boundary. <br /> Development of this system into a tropical cyclone
appears unlikely. <br /> However, gusty winds and heavy rains are still
possible across <br /> portions of the east coast of Florida and the
Bahamas during the <br /> next day or so while the low moves quickly

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0156 AM CST Wed Nov 15 2023

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Fire weather potential is expected to be limited for Thursday across
the country. Latest guidance continues to depict the passage of a
cold front across the Plains through the day. Post-frontal winds are
forecast to gust to 25-35 mph, but cooling temperatures behind the
front should limit RH reductions and the potential for prolonged
fire weather conditions. Westerly downslope flow ahead of the front
along the Front Range may support localized elevated fire weather
conditions with winds gusting to 20 mph and RH falling into the low
20s. Such conditions appear most likely from central CO to northern
NM, but are expected to remain fairly localized and transient. Dry
conditions will persist across the southern
Appalachians/Mid-Atlantic with RH minimums in the 20-30% range, but
weak winds will mitigate more robust fire weather concerns.
