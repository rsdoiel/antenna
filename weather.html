Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0738 AM CDT Wed Mar 20 2024

Valid 201300Z - 211200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS
AFTERNOON/EVENING ACROSS WESTERN OK/NORTHWEST TX...AND EARLY
THURSDAY MORNING NEAR THE TX COAST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated, marginally severe storms will be possible this
afternoon/evening across parts of western Oklahoma and northwest
Texas.  Isolated large hail will be possible early Thursday morning
near the Texas coast.

...Western OK/TX Panhandle this afternoon/evening...
A midlevel shortwave trough will begin to move eastward from AZ/NM
toward west TX by tonight, with associated downstream cyclogenesis
occurring today across eastern NM and the TX Panhandle.  Low-level
moisture return will be limited in the warm sector, with
boundary-layer dewpoints ranging from 40-45 F as surface
temperatures warm into the 70s this afternoon along a surface
trough/front across western OK and the eastern TX Panhandle. 
Steepening low-midlevel lapse rates and cool midlevel temperatures
will support weak buoyancy, and weak ascent along the boundaries
could result in a few storms with the potential to produce
marginally severe hail and strong outflow gusts.  There is also a
low probability of a non-mesocyclone tornado with developing
updrafts along the slow-moving front in northwest OK later this
afternoon, given steep low-level lapse rates/vertical vorticity
along the front.  

...South central TX to the coastal plain late tonight...
Low-level moisture return will occur in earnest by tonight as a
maritime tropical air mass spreads northward from the Bay of
Campeche (along the prior stalled front) to the TX coast.  Near the
end of the period, destabilization will become sufficient for
elevated thunderstorm development in the warm advection zone atop a
diffuse coastal front.  MUCAPE could reach 1000-1500 J/kg as
moisture increase below midlevel lapse rates of 7.5-8 C/km, in an
environment with sufficiently long hodographs (and some low-level
curvature) for a conditional supercell/large hail threat mainly
09-12z.

...Southern New England this afternoon...
A deepening midlevel trough will move from ON to New England, as an
associated cold front moves across New England later today and
cyclogenesis occurs tonight near the ME coast.  Moisture/buoyancy
will be scant at best ahead of the cold front across southern New
England, where some shallow/forced convection may occur along the
cold front this afternoon.  The convection could be associated with
a few strong gusts, but the potential for convectively driven severe
gusts appears too low to warrant introduction of an outlook area.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0154 AM CDT Wed Mar 20 2024

Valid 211200Z - 221200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Predominantly zonal mid-level flow is anticipated across the U.S. on
Thursday, leading to generally mild conditions and low fire-weather
concerns. Locally drier and windier conditions could develop in
portions of the Southern and Central Plains, but confidence is
currently too low in these scenarios to warrant any Elevated areas
at this time.

...NE Panhandle and vicinity...
Confidence has increased in a surface cyclone developing in the lee
of the Rockies near the NE Panhandle throughout the day on Thursday.
This will support some moisture return across the Southern Plains,
as well as relatively dry, downsloping flow in the NE Panhandle,
eastern WY, and northeastern CO. Deep, well-mixed boundary layers
could yield relative humidities around 20 percent across the region
with sustained winds of 15-20 mph. Fuels do not appear to be
critically dry, but could support some fire spread (e.g., ERCs
approaching the 70-80th percentiles in some areas). No Elevated area
is delineated in this outlook due to slightly lower confidence in
the location of the surface cyclone and attendant moisture
gradients; guidance will be monitored for possible future inclusion.


...West TX...
An area of slightly stronger mid-level flow is expected to
overspread West TX on Thursday afternoon, contributing to locally
gustier surface conditions. Wind speeds around 15-20 mph and
relative humidities around 15-20 percent could contribute to local
Elevated fire-weather conditions. However, highlighting a particular
area is currently difficult due to the chance for wetting
precipitation Wednesday night into Thursday morning. Confidence in
such a scenario will continue to be monitored, possibly warranting
areal delineations in future outlooks.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0337 PM CDT Sun Mar 17 2024

Valid 191200Z - 251200Z

A persistent cut-off low across the Southwest will start to advance
east toward the middle of this week. As this occurs, some light to
moderate rain is expected across portions of the southern High
Plains which will further wet fuels which are already mostly moist.
Next weekend, troughing and strong mid-level flow will resume across
the Southwest which will lead to warmer temperatures, drying and
gusty winds across the southern High Plains. There is moderate
consensus for the jet to eject across the Plains next Sunday which
will likely bring dry and breezy conditions to the southern High
Plains. This pattern will likely support critical meteorological
conditions, but fuels will be questionable. If sufficient drying
occurs late this week and over the weekend, critical probabilities
may need to be added later, but at this time it appears fuels will
likely remain too moist to support a large-fire threat by next
weekend.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS
OF THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE AND FLORIDA BIG BEND THROUGH EARLY
EVENING...

...SUMMARY...
Local/isolated risk for gusty/damaging winds remains possible the
remainder of the afternoon/early evening across the Florida
Panhandle/Big Bend area.

...20z Update...

The main change with the 20z update was to trim marginal severe
probabilities across far southeast LA and the coastal waters south
of southern MS/AL behind the ongoing clusters of storms over the
northern Gulf. Stronger heating has occurred downstream from this
cluster across parts of the FL Panhandle and FL Big Bend vicinity.
While instability remain low (less than 500 J/kg MLCAPE), some
potential for a few strong gusts will continue the remainder of the
afternoon/early evening. Otherwise, the only other changes were to
trim portions of the general thunderstorm probability over TX into
LA/MS/AL.

...Gulf Coastal area from southeastern Louisiana to the Florida Big
Bend...
A well-defined MCS with embedded MCV is moving eastward across the
southeastern Louisiana vicinity late this morning, along the
west-to-east synoptic cold front lying roughly across the Gulf Coast
region.  

West of this convective complex, weak quasi-geostrophic ascent
across Texas -- within a zone of modest low-level warm advection
beneath minor mid-level disturbances moving through fast
west-southwesterly flow aloft southeast of the Desert Southwest
upper low -- will support occasional deep convection.  However,
aside from a couple of sporadic stronger storms and possibly
brief/marginally severe hail/wind risk locally, risk appears too low
to require inclusion of probabilities in the current outlook.

East of the MCS, limited severe risk remains apparent across coastal
areas, though the strongest storms should remain over the northern
Gulf.  Still, gusty/locally damaging winds may occur, warranting
continuation of 5% wind probability as far east as the Florida Big
Bend region through tonight.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS
OF THE FLORIDA PENINSULA...

...SUMMARY...
Strong thunderstorms may move inland off the Gulf of Mexico into
portions of the northern and central Florida peninsula early Monday.
Additional thunderstorms may develop during the afternoon along the
east-central and southeast Florida coast. Strong gusts and hail may
accompany this activity.

...FL Peninsula...

An upper trough over the Great Lakes and MS Valley will pivot
east/southeast across the eastern U.S. on Monday. Forecast guidance
depicts a shortwave perturbation in the base of the trough over the
northern Gulf of Mexico shifting east across northern/north-central
FL Monday morning. Deep-layer westerly flow will increase with
southward extent across the FL Panhandle through the afternoon, with
30-40 kt 850-700 mb flow common ahead of southward-sagging surface
boundary. 

Showers and thunderstorms may be ongoing across parts of
north-central FL Monday morning. Gusty winds may accompany this
activity as it spreads east the first few hours of the forecast
period. A more conditional severe thunderstorm risk may develop
during the afternoon further south across parts of the
east-central/southeast coast. 

The NAM appears to be an outlier with the strength of an EML,
maintaining capping through the period. The RAP/HRRR/GFS show weaker
capping around 700 mb with full erosion of the cap by afternoon.
Given favorable vertical shear (0-6 effective shear around 40 kt),
steep midlevel lapse rates (around 7-7.5 C/km) and MLCAPE around
1500-2000 J/kg, at least a conditional risk for a couple of severe
storms appears plausible. Large-scale ascent will remain weak over
the area, and veered low-level flow will limit low-level convergence
along the southward-developing surface front. If a well-defined sea
breeze develops along the southeast Peninsula, this could allow for
a few storms to develop during the afternoon/early evening, posing a
conditional risk for large hail and strong gusts. For this reason,
have expanded the Marginal risk (level 1 of 5) to encompass the
southeast Peninsula.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0115 AM CDT Sun Mar 17 2024/

...Synopsis...
During the day on Sunday, mid-level pattern will be characterized by
a digging longwave trough over the central and eastern US with a
cutoff low in the southwest US. This will promote cool, northerly
surface flow across much of the central US and precipitation across
parts of the southern High Plains. As such, aside from perhaps some
locally Elevated fire risk in parts of southwest Kansas and
northwest Oklahoma, fire concerns are expected to be minimal.
