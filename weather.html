Day 1 Convective Outlook

Valid 281300Z - 291200Z

...THERE IS A MODERATE RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR SOUTHERN
MN...NORTHERN IA...AND WESTERN WI...

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM
NORTH-CENTRAL AND WESTERN OK INTO THE TX BIG COUNTRY AND SOUTHWEST
TX...

...SUMMARY...
Multiple corridors of severe thunderstorms are expected across the
Upper Midwest later today into tonight, with a regional severe
weather outbreak possible. The most dangerous period is likely
during the late afternoon and evening when strong tornado potential
should be maximized. Scattered large to very large hail and damaging
winds are likely as well.

...Synopsis...
Recent satellite imagery shows a mature cyclone centered over UT,
with a shortwave trough progressing northeastward through the
central High Plains within the eastern periphery of this cyclone.
Farther north, overnight convection across SD has contributed to the
development of vorticity maximum, which is currently moving into
western MN. 

Early morning surface analysis places a deep low over central SD,
with a dryline extending south-southwestward from this low across
central NE, western KS, the northwest TX Panhandle, southeast NM,
and far West TX. A warm front extends eastward from this low to the
ND/SD/MN border vicinity before then arcing more southeastward
across southwest MN, central IA, and eastern MO. A large warm sector
characterized largely by 60s dewpoints exists between these two
features. 

Expectation for the central High Plains shortwave trough to progress
quickly northeastward throughout the period, accompanied by a strong
jet streak (i.e. 70 to 80 kt at 500 mb). The surface low will eject
northeastward as well, reaching central MN by 00Z and continuing
into northwestern Ontario by 12Z Tuesday. Coincident
northward/northeastward movement of the warm front will bring a
warm, moist, and unstable airmass into the Upper Midwest ahead of
the approaching dryline, which will likely extend from central MN
southwestward into the TX Permian Basin by mid-afternoon. Severe
thunderstorms are expected to develop along the length of this
dryline, with the greatest severe potential across the Upper
Midwest.

...Upper Midwest...
A regional severe weather outbreak still appears possible across the
Upper Midwest, with a threat of strong to intense tornadoes, very
large hail, and swaths of damaging winds.

Convective line ongoing across central MN is expected to continue
quickly northeastward through the region, leaving ample time for the
warm front to progress northward and bring a warm, moist, and
unstable airmass into the region ahead of the dryline. Thunderstorm
initiation along the dryline is forecast to begin around 18-20Z near
the SD/MN/IA border intersection vicinity, before then continuing
quickly eastward across southern MN and northern IA throughout the
late afternoon and early evening. Volatile environmental conditions
are expected south of the warm front and east of the dryline, with
strong instability (MLCAPE near/above 3000 J/kg) and deep-layer
shear, and a persistently intense low-level jet that will maintain
very favorable low-level shear/SRH. 

This environment will be conditionally favorable for long-track
supercells with strong/intense tornado potential if a discrete mode
can be maintained. Quick upscale growth into a more linear or
cluster mode is possible, but the vertical shear appears strong
enough for a discrete mode to be maintained as well. A scenario
where a primary line develops with discrete storms ahead of it is
possible as well. In any case, the overall environment supports the
potential for large to very large hail, damaging gusts, and strong
to intense tornadoes with any discrete storms. Line-embedded
tornadoes and strong gusts are possible within any convective lines.

A more conditional scenario exists farther south from central IA
into northeast KS/northwest MO. Here, the kinematic environment will
remain supportive of supercells capable of all severe hazards, but
capping could prove detrimental to deep convection given the weaker
low-level convergence and large-scale ascent. Any supercell that can
initiate and be sustained could become long-tracked within the
expanding and very favorable warm sector, posing a threat for strong
to intense tornadoes and very large hail.

Farther west, a couple of supercells may develop in the region
between the prefrontal trough/dryline and cold front, and pose a
threat of large hail and locally damaging gusts as they move across
northeast NE/southeast SD into parts of MN/IA. 

...Western/Central OK...Northwest/Southwest TX...
Daytime heating, and resultant airmass destabilization, coupled with
convergence along the dryline is expected to result in convective
initiation from the TX Big Country into southwest TX during the
afternoon. Steep lapse rates and strong vertical shear will support
supercells, with large to very large hail as the primary severe
risk. 

Farther north in western OK, convective development will likely wait
until around 00Z when the dryline begins to retreat. The increased
low-level moisture coupled with a reduction in convective inhibition
could result in a 2-4 hour window where convective initiation is
more likely. At the same time, the low-level jet is forecast to
strengthen considerably, resulting in a kinematic environment
supportive of supercells. The tornado threat would likely maximize
between 00-04Z before nocturnal stabilization forces storms to
become more elevated. Hail potential could persist into
north-central OK as any storms that develop progress northeastward
throughout the night.

Valid 011200Z - 061200Z

CORRECTED FOR INCORRECT DAY REFERENCE

...DISCUSSION...
The extended period will begin with broad troughing across the
eastern US and a surface low tracking northeastward across the Great
Lakes. A cold front will stretch from the northeastern US southward
into the southern Plains, shifting eastward on D4/Thursday across
the Ohio Valley into the southeastern US. Beyond D4/Thursday,
heights will begin to rise across the Plains as an upper level high
strengthens, which will limit the severe threat through the end of
the extended.

...D4/Thursday - Tennessee and Ohio Valley...
On D4/Thursday, thunderstorm development is expected along the cold
front across portions of the Ohio Valley into the southern
Mississippi Valley. Model solutions differ on how much instability
will be available across Tennessee into the Ohio Valley, where the
strongest flow aloft will reside. There appears to be little overlap
between the better flow aloft and any meaningful instability, which
keeps probabilities too low to include areas in the extended.
However, some instances of wind and hail from stronger storms will
be possible across portions of Tennessee into Ohio.

...D5/Friday - Southwest Texas...
Thunderstorm development is possible along the dryline in
southwestern Texas on D5/Friday. During this period, heights aloft
will be rising, which will likely work to limit overall coverage of
thunderstorm activity. Nonetheless, a few isolated supercells may
develop with potential for large hail and severe wind. Overall,
limited coverage does not warrant inclusion of probabilities.

Valid 301200Z - 011200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS PORTIONS OF
NORTH-CENTRAL TEXAS INTO SOUTHERN OKLAHOMA...

CORRECTED FOR INCORRECT DAY REFERENCE

...SUMMARY...
Widely scattered thunderstorm activity is expected from the southern
Plains to the Great Lakes on Wednesday as a mid-level trough ejects
into the southern Plains. Severe thunderstorms will be possible
across east-central Texas into central/eastern Oklahoma.

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will eject across the southern Plains on Tuesday.
Surface low development is expected across western Texas on
D2-Tuesday, with a weak low tracking eastward into east-central
Texas by the D3-Wednesday period. Overnight thunderstorm activity is
expected at the beginning of the D3 period across portions of
central Oklahoma into east-central Texas. By the afternoon,
additional scattered thunderstorm development along the dryline near
the Red River on Wednesday afternoon will pose potential for severe
wind, hail, and a tornado.

...East-Central Texas into southern Oklahoma...
Scattered thunderstorm development along the dryline across central
Texas into Oklahoma on Wednesday afternoon will pose some severe
potential. Some uncertainty arises in coverage of morning convection
and cloud cover. However, it appears a corridor of favorable
instability and shear will overlap by the afternoon along and ahead
of the dryline. Shear profiles will be supportive of supercells
before clusters begin to form and attempts at upscale growth occur.
Large hail and damaging wind will be the primary risks given steep
lapse rates, though forecast soundings do show some curvature of low
level hodographs favorable for some tornado risk with early
supercell modes.

Mesoscale Discussion 0577
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0349 PM CDT Sun Apr 27 2025

Areas affected...parts of nw TX into the TX Pnhdl

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 272049Z - 272245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Probabilities for thunderstorm development appear low, but
may not be negligible late this afternoon into early evening, with
the environment conditionally supportive of supercells posing a risk
for large hail and tornadoes.  If and when it becomes more certain
that storms will form, a severe weather watch will probably be
needed.

DISCUSSION...Boundary-layer moisture characterized by lower/mid 60s
surface dew points is being maintained across the Lubbock through
Amarillo vicinities, beneath a deep warm elevated mixed-layer based
between 850-700 mb, just east of a dryline which may mix only slowly
northeastward/eastward into early evening.  This appears to be
contributing to strong potential instability (3000+ J/kg), beneath
moderate to strong southwesterly mid/upper flow (including 40-70+ kt
in the 500-300 mb layer), and an environment conditionally
supportive of intense supercells.

Perhaps due to the warm/dry air at mid-levels, and weak large-scale
forcing for ascent, convection allowing guidance, in particular,
continues to indicate generally low potential for thunderstorm
initiation through early evening.  However, at least attempts at
deepening convective development are evident to the west of the
dryline, and objective analysis indicates a possible secondary
maximum in dryline convergence developing near/north of Lubbock
toward areas west of Amarillo.   

Of particular concern, if a sustained storm does develop during the
next couple of hours, there appears potential for rapid
intensification while propagating across the dryline.  Toward
23-00Z, strengthening south-southeasterly low-level flow (in excess
of 30 kt around 850 mb) may contribute to enlarging clockwise curved
low-level hodographs increasingly supportive of potential for
tornadoes, in addition to large, potentially damaging hail.

Mesoscale Discussion 0576
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0347 PM CDT Sun Apr 27 2025

Areas affected...Western Kansas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 272047Z - 272245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Watch issuance in western Kansas is currently unlikely.
Significant severe would be possible if storms develop.
Observational trends will be monitored.

DISCUSSION...Periodic enhancement to the cumulus field in western
Kansas has been noted in day cloud phase satellite imagery,
primarily in the vicinity of Goodland. Low 60s F dewpoints ahead of
the surface trough/modest dryline has allowed around 2500 J/kg
MLCAPE to develop. With the generally weak dryline circulation and
uncertain/subtle mid-level ascent, the development of deep
convection is far from a given. Only the more aggressive of the CAM
models suggests development later this afternoon. However, despite
this uncertainty, the environment will be conditionally favorable
for significant severe if storms can form. Supercells would be
likely given 40-45 kts of effective shear perpendicular to the
dryline. Furthermore, a strong increase in 850 mb winds after 00Z
would support a tornado threat.

Watch issuance appears unlikely at this time, but observational
trends (including observed sounding data) will be monitored over the
next few hours.

Areas affected...2Nebraska Panhandle into the Sandhills and
Southwest Nebraska

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 272029Z - 272230Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated to widely scattered supercell potential should
increase over the next 2-3 hours. Large/very-large hail and severe
gusts will be possible. The tornado threat will initially be low,
but will increase for storms persisting near/after sunset. Trends
will be monitored for watch issuance.

DISCUSSION...As the lee trough continues to deepen this afternoon,
clusters of cumulus clouds have begun to develop in northeast
Colorado. With time and the approach of a shortwave trough, a
surface low will become more evident in eastern Colorado. Low 60s F
dewpoints have already reached parts of northwest Kansas and should
continue north and west as low-level winds respond to the surface
cyclone.

Effective shear of around 45 kts across the trough axis will promote
discrete storm development. Steep mid-level lapse rates and
initially long, straight hodographs will promote a risk for
large/very-large hail and severe winds. As the low-level jet
increases this evening, any mature supercells ongoing will have an
increased potential to produce a tornado. Storm coverage is somewhat
uncertain, but isolated to widely scattered supercells appear
possible given at least modest mid-level ascent expected over the
next few hours.

0255 PM CDT Sun Apr 27 2025

Areas affected...,parts of swrn TX

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 271955Z - 272100Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...The initiation of a couple of storms appears increasingly
likely near and northwest through north of Fort Stockton through 4-5
PM CDT.  More rapid thunderstorm intensification accompanied by
increasing potential for large hail and locally damaging wind gusts
may be initially slow, before probably increasing toward early
evening around the Midland through Big Spring vicinities.

DISCUSSION...The boundary-layer is becoming strongly heated and
deeply mixed across the Davis Mountains vicinity of southwest Texas
into the Texas South Plains.  The dryline is sharpening east through
north of Fort Stockton, where 2-hourly surface pressure falls around
2.0+ mb have been observed the past couple of hours, and low-level
convergence appears strongest.

Deepening convective development is ongoing within the deeper
mixed-boundary layer around Fort Stockton, where surface
temperature/dew point spreads are around 50 F (95/44), but forecast
soundings and HREF guidance suggests that the initiation of at least
isolated thunderstorm development is increasingly probable through
21-22Z.  It appears that this may be aided by forcing associated
with a mid-level speed maximum within southwesterly flow emanating
from the northern Mexican Plateau.

Downstream of slow moving large-scale mid-level troughing over the
southern Great Basin and Southwest, after at least some further
eastward mixing of the dryline late this afternoon, it probably will
begin to retreat northwest across the Pecos Valley vicinity toward
23-00Z.  As this occurs, convection may acquire more substantively
unstable updraft inflow (including most unstable CAPE up to
2000-3000+ J/kg), supporting increasing potential for rapid
thunderstorm intensification, in the presence of strong deep-layer
shear.  This may including a splitting supercell or two, posing a
risk for large hail and a few strong surface gusts.

Until then, though, initial thunderstorm development will probably
be more modest in strength, but could still pose some risk for
producing severe hail and wind.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0252 PM CDT Sun Apr 27 2025

Valid 272000Z - 281200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR MUCH OF THE
GREAT PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated to scattered severe thunderstorms are possible mainly this
evening into early morning Monday across parts of the Great Plains.
Large to very large hail, severe gusts, and a few tornadoes are all
possible.

...20z Update...
The previous forecast remains on track with no appreciable changes
required. Signs of broad-scale ascent beginning to overspread the
High Plains west of the surface trough/dryline are evident in latest
GOES imagery. Shallow cumulus is beginning to develop from western
NE southward into west TX, which suggests that convective initiation
within this corridor should become more probable within the next few
hours as we approach peak diurnal heating and dryline circulations
are maximized. West Texas Mesonet observations are sampling higher
dewpoints (by about 2-3 F) and stronger surface convergence than
anticipated by most model solutions. This suggests that the
probability of realizing the potent convective environment may be
increasing across the TX Panhandle (though confidence in storm
coverage remains too limited to warrant any upgrades). Further
north, recent RAP analyses show the tightest low-level lapse rate
gradient across western KS, indicative of a tighter/stronger dryline
circulation. This trend supports some recent high-res guidance that
shows convective initiation between 21-00z across this region and
warrants maintaining the current risk probabilities. Similarly,
steady surface pressure falls across western NE/SD suggest that
ascent is strongest across the central High Plains region, which
should favor at least isolated thunderstorm development this
afternoon. See the previous discussion below for additional details.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1130 AM CDT Sun Apr 27 2025/

...Synopsis...
Water-vapor imagery this morning shows a mid- to upper-level low
over NV.  A belt of strong southwesterly mid to high-level flow will
extend from the base of the western U.S. trough through the
southern/central High Plains later today into tonight.  A pair of
smaller-scale disturbances are forecast to eject east-northeastward
into the central High Plains and Black Hills vicinity during the
mid-late evening.  Concurrently, an upper ridge over the eastern
half of the Great Plains states will shift eastward over the MS
Valley towards daybreak Monday.  

Late morning surface analysis shows a developing low centered over
southeast WY with a lee trough/dryline extending southward through
the southern High Plains.  The cyclone will deepen near the WY/NE/CO
border through early evening before developing northeast into
central SD late tonight.  

...Southeast MT...Western Dakotas...
A sharpening lee trough is forecast by late this afternoon amidst
appreciable heating and moistening, especially across western SD. 
Model guidance shows a narrow plume of 500-2000 J/kg MLCAPE (highest
over SD) developing by mid-late afternoon as large-scale ascent
begins to overspread the region.  Isolated to widely scattered
thunderstorms are forecast to develop from the northern NE Panhandle
to the Black Hills, and north of the developing low over southeast
MT by late afternoon.  The stronger storms will gradually move into
richer moisture with an accompanying risk for mainly large hail and
severe gusts.  Gradual cooling during the evening will favor a
transition to elevated storms evolving with time as a LLJ
strengthens tonight.  A severe risk will probably develop farther
east in association with WAA into parts of the eastern Dakotas and
MN late.

...Central/Southern High Plains...
Visible-satellite imagery indicates a very moist boundary layer with
a mix of a cumulus field across central and north TX and eastern
NM/CO and stratus from the TX Caprock northward through OK to NE. 
The depth and quality of moisture sampled by the 12z Midland,
Amarillo, and Dodge City raobs is considered seasonably moisture
rich, and is located beneath an elevated mixed layer.  Additional
moistening through advection and evaporation will contribute to 60s
dewpoints east of a dryline/lee trough by late afternoon.  Strong
heating is forecast near the dryline from western NE southward
through West TX, which will result in a weakly capped but moderate
to very unstable airmass by 21z.  Large-scale forcing for ascent
across the region will be nebulous, but low-level convergence along
the dryline amid little to no convective inhibition may result in
convective initiation. 

With dryline convergence as the mechanism for convective initiation,
predictability is low.  Dryline circulations will likely be
strongest across the TX Panhandle/West TX where temperatures west of
the dryline will be warmest, but low-level convergence will likely
maximize in the CO/NE/KS border intersection vicinity near a
developing surface low.  As a result, these two areas may have a
greater risk for thunderstorms (isolated, widely spaced storm
coverage) late this afternoon into the evening. 

The overall environment will be very supportive of supercells with
any storms that do form, with large to very large hail as the
primary risk initially. If any storms manage to develop and become
sustained, a strengthening low-level jet will support a tornado
threat during the evening with any storms that persist (or develop
along the retreating dryline).  Nocturnal cooling and increased CINH
by mid to late evening will act to eventually weaken storm activity
in this region.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHERN NEW MEXICO INTO FAR WEST
TEXAS...

...Southern New Mexico into far west Texas...
A lingering mid-level jet atop a very dry, well-mixed boundary layer
will result in west-southwest surface winds of 15-25 mph in addition
to single digit relative humidity across southern New Mexico into
far western Texas Monday afternoon. These conditions amid ERC values
at or exceeding the 97th percentile supports the addition of
Critical highlights.

...Southeastern Colorado...
Enhanced downslope winds and drying will support at least an
Elevated fire weather threat across southeastern Colorado through
early afternoon where the fuels seasonal green-up has been delayed.
Expect west-southwest surface winds of 15-20 mph and localized
single digit relative humidity through early afternoon before a dry
cold front arrives overnight.

..Williams.. 04/27/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0358 AM CDT Sun Apr 27 2025/

...Synopsis...
A lingering mid-level trough over the western U.S. (and its
associated southwest flow), along with deep boundary layer mixing,
will result in at least Elevated fire-weather conditions across
portions of central and eastern New Mexico on Monday.

...Central and Eastern New Mexico...
With receptive fuels (ERCs exceeding the 80th-90th annual
percentiles) and dry, windy conditions across much of central and
eastern New Mexico, at least Elevated fire-weather conditions are
expected. 00Z HREF guidance suggests that there is potential for
Critical conditions, particularly across central New Mexico, but
there is enough ensemble spread in the HREF to preclude adding
highlights at this time. While the dry and windy conditions are
likely to occur further east into the Texas Panhandle, recent
wetting rainfall over the last several days should limit fire
danger.

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS IN PARTS OF OH
TO WESTERN PA/NY...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are likely across parts of the Lower
Great Lakes on Tuesday afternoon/evening. Scattered severe
thunderstorms are possible southwestward into the southern Great
Plains. Isolated significant-severe potential, mainly from hail, is
apparent across west Texas and separately in parts of the eastern
Midwest to Lower Great Lakes.

...Synopsis...
A consolidated shortwave trough should move east across the Great
Lakes and southeast Canada. A southern-stream trough over the
Southwest to northwest Mexico should drift east. Primary surface
cyclone over northeast ON should quickly progress towards the
Canadian Maritimes. An attendant cold front will push across the
central to Lower Great Lakes Tuesday afternoon and evening. A weaker
surface low should remain anchored over the TX Trans-Pecos. 

...Eastern Midwest/Lower Great Lakes...
The eastern extent of a pervasive EML will support potential for at
least moderate buoyancy across a broadening warm-moist sector ahead
of the aforementioned cold front. Rather strong mid-level westerlies
should be present from the Great Lakes vicinity northward, trailing
in magnitude but still moderate to strong across the OH Valley.
While evolution of early-day convection from late D2 is uncertain,
potential exists for pronounced boundary-layer heating amid robust
low-level moistening to the northeast. With stronger mid-level
height falls north of the international border, overall setup could
favor discrete to semi-discrete supercells that eventually merge
into clusters/short lines by evening. Confidence is sufficient in
upgrading/expanding categorical risks along with adding a
significant severe highlight, most likely for hail at this time. 

...TX/OK...
Multiple rounds of thunderstorms are expected through the period
along a convectively modulated, quasi-stationary baroclinic zone.
This renders enough uncertainty to mitigate a corridor of greater
severe potential, but a mesoscale-driven Enhanced Risk may be needed
in later outlooks. Adequate mid-level southwesterlies will persist
through the period for supercells, with most guidance hinting at
training convection along the west/southwest to east-northeast
oriented portion of the zone near the Red River. More probable
scenario for very large hail should exist to the southwest of that
corridor, with a few dryline supercells favored in the late
afternoon to early evening.

...THERE IS A MODERATE RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS IN SOUTHERN
MN/NORTHERN IA/WESTERN WI...

...SUMMARY...
Multiple corridors of severe thunderstorms are expected across the
Upper Midwest on Monday into Monday night, with a regional severe
weather outbreak possible. The most dangerous period is likely
during the late afternoon and evening when strong tornado potential
should be maximized. Scattered large to very large hail and damaging
winds are likely as well.

...Synopsis...
A positive-tilt, upper-level trough will consist of multiple
embedded shortwave impulses, moving east-northeast from the central
High Plains to the Upper Midwest. A belt of 70+ kt 500-mb
southwesterlies will be present from the central Great Plains to the
Upper MS Valley on Monday afternoon. Primary surface cyclone should
deepen slightly during the day as it advances from eastern SD to the
Upper Great Lakes. A dryline will extend from the Mid-MO Valley
south-southwest into west TX. A cold front will overtake the dryline
as it surges southeast Monday night. 

...Upper Midwest...
After coordination with affected WFOs, primary adjustments have
occurred along the southern extent of the severe probabilities to
account for a more conditional, but still potentially significant
severe threat.

An arc of elevated thunderstorms will be ongoing at 12Z Monday from
ND across the Upper MS Valley. Isolated large hail will be possible
with these morning storms as they move east-northeast. Additional
elevated storms will redevelop towards midday/early afternoon to the
northeast of the aforementioned surface low. This will slow the
advancement of the surface warm front into central MN, but
strengthen differential surface heating across the baroclinic zone,
with greater warming nosing north from NE into southeast SD.
Surface-based storm development should occur by mid-afternoon across
a portion of the Mid-MO Valley into southwest/west-central MN along
the dryline to surface low. Large hail should be the primary initial
threat, but cells may congeal into linear clusters, especially
near/across the warm front. A mix of hail/wind/embedded tornadoes is
likely, with the latter increasing with southern/eastern extent
during late afternoon owing to stronger low-level shear across
southeast MN/northeast IA into western WI. 

Open warm-sector storm development ahead of the dryline is nebulous
with low confidence on the degree of ascent ahead of the dryline
given the synoptic setup. Conditionally, both the buoyancy/shear
parameter space is volatile and supportive of potential for multiple
long-track, tornadic supercells. Timing of mid-level height falls
tends to favor the evening period after peak heating but CAM
signals, outside of the 12Z FV3, are sparse. Greater large-scale
ascent appears focused from far northeast IA into WI. This region
remains the most favorable for discrete warm-sector development
during the evening. Otherwise, upstream linear clusters from
southern/eastern MN will likely spread across northern/central WI
into parts of Upper MI with a mixed mode of all hazards persisting,
before eventually weakening overnight. 

...Eastern KS/northern MO to west TX...
Overall forcing will be weaker farther south along the dryline, but
subtle mid-level height falls across a mostly uncapped warm sector
should result in isolated to scattered supercell development during
the late afternoon to evening. This appears most likely across
western north TX into southwest OK where greater boundary-layer
heating and a nocturnally strengthening low-level jet are
anticipated.

...EXTREMELY CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN NEW
MEXICO INTO FAR WEST TEXAS...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR MUCH OF CENTRAL NEW MEXICO INTO
FAR WEST TEXAS...

...Southeast Pennsylvania and New Jersey...
Elevated highlights were added across portions of southeastern
Pennsylvania and New Jersey where strong offshore flow within a
post-frontal regime is ongoing. Northwest winds of 15-25 mph with
gusts up to 40 mph combined with relative humidity falling into the
25-35 percent range are expected through the early afternoon before
winds subside late afternoon. Rainfall over the last 48 hours was
spotty so pockets of receptive fuels remain, primarily in the New
Jersey Pinelands.

...Southwest and adjacent High Plains...
Significant fire weather threat remains across the Southwest with
swath of Extremely Critical highlights in place across much of
southern and central New Mexico. Elevated highlights were extended
into far southeastern Utah and far western Colorado to account for
some lower elevation receptive fuels. Otherwise, previous forecast
(see below) remains on track.

..Williams.. 04/27/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0109 AM CDT Sun Apr 27 2025/

...Synopsis...
With a mid-level trough translating across the Intermountain West,
and a lee cyclone deepening over the central High Plains, strong
surface winds and deep boundary layer mixing are forecast across
much of the Southwest into the southern High Plains. Critical to
Extremely Critical fire-weather conditions are expected across much
of southern and central New Mexico, into portions of far West Texas.


...Central/Southern New Mexico into Far West Texas...
Widespread 30+ MPH winds and 5-10% relative humidity is anticipated
over much of southern, central, and even portions of eastern New
Mexico. While dry and windy conditions are anticipated further east
of the current highlights, recent wetting rainfall in eastern New
Mexico over the last several days will serve to limit the
receptiveness of fuels to wildfire ignition and spread. Therefore,
Critical and Extremely Critical highlights have been confined to
where fuels guidance shows ERCs exceeding the 90th annual
percentile, primarily across southern and central New Mexico. 

...Eastern Colorado...
Elevated highlights have been maintained over eastern Colorado,
where dormant/fine fuels are anticipated to be receptive to wildfire
ignition and spread with an environment characterized by 10%
relative humidity and 15-20 MPH winds. Some recent wetting rainfall
has occurred across eastern Colorado, with areas receiving 0.75-2.0
inches of rainfall in the last 48 hours. The Elevated highlights in
this update reflect the driest areas receiving little to no
rainfall.
