Mesoscale Discussion 0695
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0956 AM CDT Wed May 08 2024

Areas affected...Eastern TN and western NC

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 203...

Valid 081456Z - 081630Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 203
continues.

SUMMARY...A pair of supercells will pose threats for large hail of
1-1.75 inches in diameter and damaging winds from 55-70 mph as they
likely persist east-southeast across the remainder of eastern
Tennessee and into western North Carolina.

DISCUSSION...A pair of long-lived supercells, the easternmost of
which appears to be the more intense of the two, are steadily
tracking east-southeast across eastern TN. The downstream air mass
continues to destabilize, with surface temperatures having warmed
through the 60s to low 70s over the Great Smoky and Blue Ridge
Mountains, and through the 70s to low 80s across the adjacent
Piedmont. This will support the eastern extension of the TN Valley
buoyancy plume which was characterized by MLCAPE of 2000-2500 J/kg
per the 12Z BNA sounding. While low-level shear will remain weak per
MRX VWP data, strong mid to upper-level westerlies will support
persistence of discrete supercells which may consolidate into a
cluster as they emerge east of the higher terrain in the early
afternoon.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0755 AM CDT Wed May 08 2024

Valid 081300Z - 091200Z

...THERE IS A MODERATE RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVE PORTIONS OF
SOUTHERN/SOUTHEASTERN MISSOURI...EXTREME NORTHEASTERN AR...EXTREME
SOUTHERN ILLINOIS...WESTERN/SOUTH-CENTRAL KENTUCKY...AND
NORTHWESTERN TO MIDDLE TENNESSEE...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms appear likely from parts of the mid
Mississippi, Ohio, and Tennessee Valleys into the southern Plains. 
All severe hazards, including tornadoes, very large to giant hail,
and potentially significant damaging winds are possible.  Some
tornadoes may be strong.

...Synopsis...
In mid/upper levels, a temporarily blocky pattern has evolved around
a cutoff cyclone over the northern Great Plains.  The associated
500-mb low is expected to drift erratically southeastward and fill
slowly through the remainder of the period, while a series of
shortwaves amplify associated synoptic troughing extending
southwestward across the Intermountain West and Great Basin. 
Meanwhile, a northern-stream perturbation over the Upper Great
Lakes, that peeled eastward off the cyclone's influence, has a
compact cyclone aloft centered near ANJ.  This feature should
devolve into an open shortwave trough and accelerate eastward as it
enters the northern stream today, reaching eastern NY and western
New England around 00Z.

In the southern stream, broadly cyclonic flow will prevail over the
western CONUS.  A weak perturbation -- apparent in moisture-channel
imagery over the central Gulf of California -- should move
east-northeastward through the period, reaching northern Coahuila
and adjoining southwest TX around 00Z, then parts of LA/northern MS
by the end of the period.  Downstream perturbations over the
Southeast and central/southern Appalachians should be predominantly
convectively derived.

At 11Z, a surface lows were evident over southwestern ND and between
OFK-YKN, along an occluded front.  An occluded/cold front arched
from the NE low across northeastern KS to another weak low near CNU,
then southwestward over southwestern OK and the TX South Plains. 
Today, the cold front will overtake the northern part of a dryline
now over northwest TX to the Big Bend region.  By 00Z, the front and
dryline together will act as a western limit of substantial
convective/severe potential, from eastern OK to
north-central/central TX.  A Gulf warm front over northeastern OK
and central/northeastern AR was moving northward and should cross
the Ozarks this morning, moving into southern MO.  A progressive
outflow boundary was apparent from northern VA across southern WV,
southeastern KY, to northern parts of middle/western TN and
southeastern MO.  The western part of this boundary is stalling, and
soon should retreat northward through the rest of the morning across
parts of western KY and southeastern MO, essentially linking with
the warm front to form a baroclinic zone focusing the greatest of
today's severe risks.

...Ozarks to Mid Mississippi, lower Ohio and Tennessee Valleys...
A complicated, potentially dangerous severe-weather event is
possible today into this evening.  Multiple rounds of strong-severe
thunderstorms are expected today across this region, additively
contributing enough severe hazard for the "moderate" (level 4 of 5)
risk area.  A swath of damaging to severe gusts and at least a few
embedded tornadoes are likely to accompany a complex of
thunderstorms from southern MO across parts of the multi-state area
near the Ohio/Mississippi River junction, to at least northern parts
of the Tennessee Valley region.  The main MCS should move
east-southeastward to southeastward along and near the instability
gradient associated with the aforementioned outflow boundary. 
Before and during that process, several supercells are expected,
offering tornadoes (a few potentially significant/EF2+), large to
very large hail, and localized severe gusts.

An ongoing area of strong-severe thunderstorms across portions of MO
should pose mainly a severe-hail threat for another couple hours,
though the gust potential will increase as it grows upscale.  See
severe thunderstorm watch 202 and related mesoscale discussions for
the near-term threat.  As the morning progresses, the wind threat
will ramp up further, with some tornado potential starting as well,
as this activity and/or additional convection developing later over
western MO interacts with 1) a northward-moving plume of
surface-based inflow air and 2) rich low-level moisture now found
south of the outflow boundary.  Meanwhile, diurnal destabilization
of an already richly moist airmass south of the boundary will grow
MLCAPE commonly into the 3000-4000 J/kg range, beneath favorable 
(50-60 kt) deep shear.  Low-level shear/vorticity, SRH and hodograph
size will peak near the boundary, supporting a corridor of
relatively maximized tornado potential with any sustained/discrete
or semi-discrete supercells in the area, as well as a focus for MCS
forward propagation from the northwest.  MCS activity should merge
upscale further this evening and tonight, maintaining severe-wind
potential into parts of the Tennessee Valley region before moving
into gradually less instability late tonight.

...Eastern OK to AR, Mid-South and central TX...
Thunderstorms should develop by late afternoon near the front and
dryline, as a combination of lift along those boundaries and strong
surface heating combine with very rich low-level moisture to erode
the EML cap sampled well by the 12Z FWD RAOB.  Large to giant hail,
occasional severe gusts, and a few tornadoes are possible as
activity shifts eastward to northeastward across central/east TX,
the Arklatex, and AR through the evening.  The northern part of this
convection may merge with or be overtaken by MCS activity moving out
of MO and into parts of the Mid-South.

The afternoon/preconvective environment should be characterized by
steep low/middle level lapse rates on either side of the weakening
cap, along with surface dewpoints commonly in the 70s F.  This will
contribute to strong buoyancy with the peak/preconvective MLCAPE
reaching 4500-5500 J/kg, and SBCAPE values topping 6000 J/kg. 
Although near-surface flow generally will be 10 kt or less, limiting
lowest-km hodographs/shear, effective-shear magnitudes in the
40-55-kt range indicate supercells will be possible.  These will be
capable of very large/destructive hail exceeding 3 inches in
diameter.  Clusters or upscale mergers of convection also may offer
deep, precip-loaded, hail-cooled downdrafts with locally severe
gusts.  Cell mergers and interactions with boundaries will factor
into tornado potential on the storm scale, since the environmental
low-level shear appears on the margins.

...Southern Appalachians/Cumberland Plateau into Carolinas...
Thunderstorms are ongoing along and behind the outflow boundary near
the TN/KY border area, and may pose a severe threat through the
remainder of the morning while moving generally southeastward.  See
SPC mesoscale discussion 693 for near-term details.  Further
intensification and/or additional development is possible into the
afternoon over and east of the mountains, moving into an environment
of favorable moisture and diurnal destabilization.  MLCAPE in the
1500-2500 J/kg range appears attainable, amidst roughly 35-45-kt
effective-shear magnitudes.  A mix of supercell and multicell modes
is expected, with small bows possible, supporting localized threats
for damaging wind, large hail and at least marginal tornado
potential.

...Northeastern CONUS...
Widely scattered to scattered thunderstorms may develop as soon as
mid/late morning over parts of eastern NY and New England.  Activity
should form atop a diurnally destabilizing and weakly capped
boundary layer, along/ahead of a prefrontal surface trough and
behind a plume of non-severe thunderstorms and precip now crossing
parts of the region.  Thunderstorms should move generally eastward,
offering damaging to isolated severe gusts and isolated large hail. 
A combination of low-level warm advection, spotty/irregular diurnal
surface heating, and cooling aloft related to the approaching Great
Lakes shortwave trough, will steepen low/middle-level lapse rates
substantially.  With favorable moisture (surface dewpoints generally
50s to low 60s F), a plume of 500-1000 J/kg MLCAPE should develop,
amidst effective-shear magnitudes that reach 40-50 kt, and despite
strongly veered/westerly surface wind components.  A mix of
multicell and modest supercell characteristics should be observed
before activity moves over more-stable air and/or offshore, and
weakens by early evening.

...Eastern SD to eastern IA and vicinity...
Widely scattered to scattered thunderstorms are possible from early
afternoon in western parts to evening closer to the Mississippi
River, with isolated damaging gusts, large hail and possibly a
tornado or two.  Activity should form in an area of deep-layer lift
(including low-level convergence/mass response) related to a
vorticity lobe in the southeastern part of the mid/upper-level
cyclone.  Associated cooling aloft will combine with residual
low-level moisture (dewpoints mid 40s to mid 50s F) to yield pockets
of around 500-1000 J/kg MLCAPE.  Backed low-level winds will aid
convergence and storm-relative low-level flow, and may contribute to
locally enlarged hodographs.

Mesoscale Discussion 0680
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0333 PM CDT Tue May 07 2024

Areas affected...southern Lower MI...eastern IN...western OH...far
northern KY

Concerning...Severe potential...Tornado Watch likely 

Valid 072033Z - 072200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...As supercells spread quickly east-northeast from southern
Lower MI and northwest IN, an additional tornado watch/watches will
be needed prior to 22Z. This may also include a combined/separate
watch farther south in eastern IN/western OH ahead of supercells
intensifying over the Wabash Valley.

DISCUSSION...As mentioned in MCD 0679, an increasingly favorable
setup for supercells, a couple of which may be long-tracked, is
underway across northwest IN to the Wabash Valley. The northern
storms may being to outpace the rapid boundary-layer
warming/moistening that is occurring across northeast IN and
northwest OH into southern Lower MI. Nevertheless, the intense
mid-level jet will likely foster sustained supercells even as they
become slightly elevated towards southeast Lower MI. With backed
low-level flow and ample low-level shear (per IWX VWP data), the
tornado threat will remain prominent with any supercells along and
south of the surface warm front. A couple strong tornadoes are
possible.

Mesoscale Discussion 0679
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0253 PM CDT Tue May 07 2024

Areas affected...eastern IL...IN...and southwest Lower MI

Concerning...Tornado Watch 195...

Valid 071953Z - 072100Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 195 continues.

SUMMARY...Additional supercells are expected to develop and
intensify from the Lake Michigan vicinity southward towards the
Wabash Valley. Large hail and severe wind gusts will be possible,
with the tornado threat increasing as supercells mature into
Indiana.

DISCUSSION...A pair of supercells have been sustained along the
IL/WI border and earlier across the south part of Chicagoland, both
of which should weaken as they progress across southern Lake
Michigan. Several additional updrafts are gradually maturing farther
south over eastern into southern IL and northwest IN. Richer
boundary-layer moisture and stronger low-level shear across the
Wabash Valley portion of the region, all render increasing concern
for one or two of these storms to become long-track supercells.
Within an environment characterized by STP around 3-4, potential
will exist for a strong tornado. A limiting factor though with
southern extent is the degree of mid-level warmth/dryness south of
the intense jet that is ejecting farther north across northern IL
into southern Lower MI. This also renders uncertainty with how far
south sustained supercell development will occur in the near-term
over the Lower OH Valley.

Mesoscale Discussion 0678
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0205 PM CDT Tue May 07 2024

Areas affected...parts of central Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 071905Z - 072130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated storms may develop by late afternoon, with a
conditional threat of very large hail. A small Slight Risk is also
being added to the 20Z convective outlook.

DISCUSSION...Surface analysis shows a stationary front from Dallas
southwestward toward Del Rio, with generally weak wind convergence.
Ample low-level moisture exists south and east of the boundary, with
70s F dewpoints and MLCAPE in excess of 3000 J/kg. Convective
inhibition continues to decrease due to heating, as temperature rise
into the upper 80s to near 90 F. 

Visible imagery shows increasing CU fields west of the I-35 corridor
from Austin to San Antonio, particularly along the west edge of a
thicker but eroding cloud deck. 

Over the next few hours, isolated severe storms may form over this
small region. Relatively long and straight hodographs along with the
deepening moist boundary layer and very strong instability will
conditionally support very large hail. Splitting cells may occur as
well, with left movers also producing hail.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 195
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
225 PM EDT Tue May 7 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Central and Northern Illinois
  Central and Northern Indiana
  Southwest Lower Michigan
  Southeast Wisconsin
  Lake Michigan

* Effective this Tuesday afternoon and evening from 225 PM until
  900 PM EDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A few tornadoes likely with a couple intense tornadoes possible
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2.5
    inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...Scattered thunderstorms are forecast to continue to
develop and intensify this afternoon into the early evening.  The
environment will continue to destabilize through the mid to late
afternoon across much of the Watch area.  The stronger storms will
likely become supercellular and pose a risk for large to very large
hail, severe gusts, and tornadoes.  A couple of the more intense
supercells may yield the potential for a strong tornado.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 100 statute miles
east and west of a line from 30 miles east northeast of Racine WI to
60 miles southwest of Bloomington IN. For a complete depiction of
the watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS
WOU5).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF SOUTHERN NEW MEXICO AND
THE TRANS-PECOS...

No changes are needed to the D2 Fire Weather Outlook. See previous
discussion below for more information.

..Thornton.. 05/07/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1258 AM CDT Tue May 07 2024/

...Synopsis...
The upper trough will broaden and elongate across much of the CONUS
on Wednesday. Mid-level winds, though weakening some, will still
remain across the southern Rockies. The surface low will migrate
southward into parts of Central Texas and the Rio Grande Valley.
With time, some colder air will push southward into New Mexico.

...Southwest and Trans-Pecos...
Surface winds of 15-25 mph are expected again across the region.
Coverage of these winds will likely be less given the weaker
synoptic features. The area with the highest confidence for stronger
winds of sufficient duration will be across southern New Mexico into
the Trans-Pecos. Stronger winds also appear possible in northeast
New Mexico, but the duration of these winds is not certain. RH will
fall to 10-15% for most of the region. Elevated to critical fire
weather will occur for a few hours during the afternoon.

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR
INDIANA...WESTERN AND CENTRAL OHIO...AND NORTHERN KENTUCKY...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS
SOUTH-CENTRAL TEXAS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are expected across the southern
Great Lakes and Ohio Valley through evening.  A few tornadoes (some
strong), large to very large hail, and severe/damaging winds all
appear possible.

...20z Update...

Most of the ongoing outlook remains on track and reasoning has not
changed from the previous forecast. See Tornado Watch 195 and any
forthcoming MCDs regarding short term severe potential across parts
of the Midwest. 

A small Slight risk (level 2 of 5) has been added over portions of
central TX. A few storms capable of large hail (2.5+ inches
diameter) appear possible through evening. Agitated cumulus in a
very moist/unstable environment amid modest low-level convergence
continue to deepen this afternoon. Forecast soundings depict a
favorable environment for isolated but possible significant hail.
While this risk is somewhat conditional/isolated, given the
possibility for 2.5+ inch hail an upgrade to 15% SIG hail
probabilities appears warranted. For more details, see MCD 678.

..Leitman.. 05/07/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1136 AM CDT Tue May 07 2024/

...Southern Great Lakes/Ohio Valley and vicinity...
Considerable uncertainty remains for this forecast due largely in
part to an ongoing broken squall line moving east across KY/IN/Lake
Michigan and the related influences for airmass destabilization in
its wake.  However, clearing skies in the MCS' wake will result in a
seemingly sufficient period of heating during the afternoon. 
Water-vapor imagery shows the deep-layer cyclone centered over the
northern Great Plains.  A mid-level speed max rotating through the
base of the larger-scale trough will move from the mid MS Valley
late this morning into the southern Great Lakes by early evening. 
Rapid strengthening of southwesterly 500-mb flow is forecast over
northern IL into the northern half of IN through the mid-late
afternoon.  As an effective warm frontal zone becomes draped across
the southern Great Lakes/OH Valley regions, curved low-level
hodographs beneath a lengthening of the mid and upper part of the
hodograph will support a supercell risk.  It seems most probable
based on morning model guidance that storms will initially develop
across central/northern IL and move northeast into northern IN. 
Isolated to scattered storms are forecast to eventually develop this
afternoon across parts of the OH Valley in association with
warm/moist-air advection---although considerable uncertainty remains
regarding this scenario.  The stronger storms (i.e., supercells)
will be potentially capable of a large to very large hail threat, in
addition to several tornadoes (perhaps a few which may be strong).  

...Arklatex to north-central and south-central TX...
Not much change in the forecast thinking across the Mid South
southwestward into parts of TX.  Isolated severe thunderstorms are
possible during mid/late afternoon.  Damaging gusts and large hail
would be the main concerns.  The threat over the area is conditional
-- more due to weak lift than thermodynamic considerations.  Surface
dewpoints commonly in the 70s F will underlie a deep troposphere and
enough middle-level lapse rates for MLCAPE in the 3500-4500 J/kg
range.  Weak low-level winds will constrain hodograph size and
boundary- layer shear.  However, enough mid/upper flow remains to
support around 45-55 kt effective-shear magnitudes, yielding a
conditional supercell environment.  In the absence of meaningful
large-scale support, and with shallower overall lift near the
front/dryline, convective coverage over this region is more in
question and likely isolated.  Additional convection may form
overnight in a warm-advection plume near and southeast of the front,
across parts of the Mid-South to Arklatex regions.  Marginal hail
and isolated damaging gusts would be the main concerns.

...Southeast KS late tonight...
A strengthening LLJ and associated warm-air advection will be
focused over the northeast OK/southeast KS region late tonight. 
Forecast soundings show large MUCAPE amidst strong deep-layer shear.
Large hail may accompany a stronger storm or two that manages to
develop/become sustained during the 08-12z period.

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM NORTHEAST
TEXAS INTO THE MID-SOUTH/MID MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AND LOWER OHIO
VALLEY...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered to numerous severe thunderstorms appear likely Wednesday
across parts of the southern Plains into the mid Mississippi, Ohio,
and Tennessee Valleys. All severe hazards, including tornadoes, very
large hail, and severe/damaging winds should occur. Some of the
tornadoes may be strong.

...Synopsis...

An upper low/trough, initially over the northern Plains Wednesday
morning, will develop east to the Upper Midwest/Great Lakes vicinity
by Thursday morning. Meanwhile, a more compact upper shortwave
trough over the Lower Great Lakes will shift east/northeast over the
Northeastern U.S. This regime will maintain a broad swath of 50-70
kt southwesterly midlevel/upper flow from the central/southern
Plains to the Midwest/Mid-South and Northeast. This broad area of
enhanced flow aloft will contribute to a strongly sheared
environment atop a very moist boundary-layer. While the upper
low/trough will progress east through the period, overall height
falls across the Midwest/OH-TN Valleys are expected to remain modest
until overnight. Large-scale ascent will be somewhat modest/nebulous
through the day, with mesoscale features/ascent perhaps more of a
driver of storm development/evolution.

At the surface, the general expectation is that a surface low over
MO early in the period will develop east across the Ohio Valley
vicinity. A warm front will extend east from the low across
IL/IN/OH, but there is quite a bit of variability in forecast
guidance regarding how far north this boundary will retreat during
the day. A cold front/dryline also is forecast to extend southwest
from the low across western MO/eastern OK/central TX during the
afternoon. The cold front will surge east/southeast overnight across
the Ozarks/Mid-South. These boundaries will collectively focus
thunderstorm development through the period.

...ArkLaTex into the Mid-MS/OH/TN Valleys...

A very moist and broad warm sector is anticipated, with surface
dewpoints in the upper 60s to mid 70s F already in place across much
of the region. Heating into the 80s F and a plume of steep midlevel
lapse rates overspreading the region will aid in strong
destabilization (MLCAPE 2500-4000 J/kg). With 40-50 kt effective
shear magnitudes, organized convection is expected. Convective mode
may be somewhat messy, with clusters/semi-discrete supercells and
bowing line segments possible. Little inhibition is expected across
the warm sector, so thunderstorm coverage could be quite widespread.

Initial thunderstorms development is likely during the morning near
the triple point in MO. Most guidance suggests this activity will
quickly grow upscale into an eastward advancing line/bow across MO.
More semi-discrete convection is then anticipated by midday/early
afternoon in the vicinity of the warm front across southern
IL/western KY, spreading eastward with time across IN/KY/southern OH
and TN. Additional storms are expected by mid to late afternoon
along the cold front across AR/southeast OK/northeast TX. Large to
very large hail (2-3 inch diameter) will be possible with more
cellular convection given very large instability, steep midlevel
lapse rates and favorable vertical shear. Tornado potential is also
apparent, given favorable low-level shear as is evident in enlarged,
curved 0-3 km forecast hodographs. Mesovortex tornado potential also
will accompany any bows/QLCS structures as well. Furthermore,
potentially widespread damaging/severe winds appears possible,
especially if strong enough cold pools can be generated within
linear segments. 

Given little inhibition across the region and somewhat nebulous
large-scale forcing, convective evolution is somewhat uncertain
(widespread convection all at once vs. semi-discrete convection
growing upscale with time, etc). A corridor of higher probability
severe may develop from southeast MO/southern IL into western KY.
However, confidence is too low at this time for a categorical
upgrade.

...Iowa and Vicinity...

Isolated strong to severe thunderstorms appear possible in
associated with a cold-core upper low across parts of IA and
vicinity, mainly Wednesday afternoon. Although forecast instability
and deep-layer shear appear fairly weak/marginal, a few instances of
hail and strong/gusty winds appear possible. A brief tornado or two
may also occur along/near the occluded front.

...Southern New England into NY and the Mid-Atlantic/Carolinas...

Occasional hail and strong to locally damaging winds appear possible
with isolated thunderstorms across parts of NY into southern New
England as a surface low and attendant cold front move eastward
through the day. 

Farther south into the Mid-Atlantic/Carolinas, more substantial
instability is forecast (up to 2500 J/kg MLCAPE). Large-scale ascent
is expected to remain weak over the region. However, strong heating
of a moist boundary-layer and the presence of a surface trough
extending southward into the Carolinas may be sufficient for greater
thunderstorm coverage than previously expected. As a result, a
Slight risk has been extended eastward across parts of VA/NC. Large
hail and damaging gusts will be possible with thunderstorm activity
through the evening.

Valid 071700Z - 081200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF CENTRAL/EASTERN NEW
MEXICO INTO SOUTHEAST COLORADO...

The Elevated area was extended westward into the White Mountains in
northern Arizona. Latest fuel guidance indicates ERCs in this region
are approaching the 75 percentile. Otherwise, no changes were made
to the Critical area. See previous discussion for more information.

..Thornton.. 05/07/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1256 AM CDT Tue May 07 2024/

...Synopsis...
A broad upper cyclone will be situated in the northern Plains today.
Strong mid-level winds will remain across the southern Rockies. A
surface cyclone will deepen in the southern High Plains.

...Southwest...
Strong surface winds will develop in response to the upper trough
and surface cyclone to the east. Winds of 15-25 mph appear probable
with locally higher speeds in terrain-favored areas. RH will fall to
10-15% though single digits could occur locally. Fuels in the area
will continue to support an elevated to critical fire weather
threat.

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR
INDIANA...WESTERN AND CENTRAL OHIO...AND NORTHERN KENTUCKY...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are expected across the southern
Great Lakes and Ohio Valley this afternoon and evening.  A few
tornadoes (some strong), large to very large hail, and
severe/damaging winds all appear possible.

...Southern Great Lakes/Ohio Valley and vicinity...
Considerable uncertainty remains for this forecast due largely in
part to an ongoing broken squall line moving east across KY/IN/Lake
Michigan and the related influences for airmass destabilization in
its wake.  However, clearing skies in the MCS' wake will result in a
seemingly sufficient period of heating during the afternoon. 
Water-vapor imagery shows the deep-layer cyclone centered over the
northern Great Plains.  A mid-level speed max rotating through the
base of the larger-scale trough will move from the mid MS Valley
late this morning into the southern Great Lakes by early evening. 
Rapid strengthening of southwesterly 500-mb flow is forecast over
northern IL into the northern half of IN through the mid-late
afternoon.  As an effective warm frontal zone becomes draped across
the southern Great Lakes/OH Valley regions, curved low-level
hodographs beneath a lengthening of the mid and upper part of the
hodograph will support a supercell risk.  It seems most probable
based on morning model guidance that storms will initially develop
across central/northern IL and move northeast into northern IN. 
Isolated to scattered storms are forecast to eventually develop this
afternoon across parts of the OH Valley in association with
warm/moist-air advection---although considerable uncertainty remains
regarding this scenario.  The stronger storms (i.e., supercells)
will be potentially capable of a large to very large hail threat, in
addition to several tornadoes (perhaps a few which may be strong).  

...Arklatex to north-central and south-central TX...
Not much change in the forecast thinking across the Mid South
southwestward into parts of TX.  Isolated severe thunderstorms are
possible during mid/late afternoon.  Damaging gusts and large hail
would be the main concerns.  The threat over the area is conditional
-- more due to weak lift than thermodynamic considerations.  Surface
dewpoints commonly in the 70s F will underlie a deep troposphere and
enough middle-level lapse rates for MLCAPE in the 3500-4500 J/kg
range.  Weak low-level winds will constrain hodograph size and
boundary- layer shear.  However, enough mid/upper flow remains to
support around 45-55 kt effective-shear magnitudes, yielding a
conditional supercell environment.  In the absence of meaningful
large-scale support, and with shallower overall lift near the
front/dryline, convective coverage over this region is more in
question and likely isolated.  Additional convection may form
overnight in a warm-advection plume near and southeast of the front,
across parts of the Mid-South to Arklatex regions.  Marginal hail
and isolated damaging gusts would be the main concerns.

...Southeast KS late tonight...
A strengthening LLJ and associated warm-air advection will be
focused over the northeast OK/southeast KS region late tonight. 
Forecast soundings show large MUCAPE amidst strong deep-layer shear.
Large hail may accompany a stronger storm or two that manages to
develop/become sustained during the 08-12z period.

  Plains from this afternoon through evening.

Preparedness actions...

Review your severe weather safety procedures for the possibility
of dangerous weather today. Stay tuned to NOAA Weather Radio, 
weather.gov, or other media for watches and warnings. A tornado
watch means that conditions are favorable for tornadoes to form
during the next several hours. If a tornado warning is issued for
your area, move to a place of safety, ideally in a basement or
interior room on the lowest floor of a sturdy building.
