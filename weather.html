Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0614 AM CST Mon Dec 30 2024

Valid 301300Z - 311200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected through tonight.

...Synopsis/Discussion...
Broadly cyclonic flow will be maintained over most of the CONUS in
mid/upper levels, except for progressive shortwave ridging in
between these two perturbations:

1.  A strong, negatively tilted shortwave trough apparent in
moisture-channel imagery from a 500-mb low over Lake Huron,
southeastward WV to coastal SC.  This feature is expected to lose
amplitude while pivoting northeastward up the East Coast and
central/northern Appalachians, and across the Lower Great Lakes,
through the end of the period.  The associated surface cold front is
offshore from the mid-Atlantic, and extends southwestward across
central FL to the central Gulf, where frontal deceleration and
weakening are expected through most of the period. 

2.  An initially weaker shortwave trough, evident from the Black
Hills southward over eastern CO. This feature should strengthen
today and tonight as several proximal vorticity lobes phase with
each other, and ageostrophic/baroclinic forcings intensify.  The
trough should move east-southeastward across the central Plains and
lower Missouri Valley, reaching the lower Ohio Valley and Mid-South
region by 12Z tomorrow.  In the wake of prior cold-frontal passage,
low/middle-level moisture will be weak, yet still sufficient to
support isolated, nocturnal, non-severe thunderstorms amidst a
corridor of strong large-scale ascent/destabilization aloft, from
the mid-Mississippi Valley to lower Ohio Valley region.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0204 AM CST Mon Dec 30 2024

Valid 311200Z - 011200Z

...Synopsis...
A moderate Santa Ana wind event is expected on D2/Tuesday as
offshore gradients continue across southern California D1/Monday
into D2/Tuesday. Gradients will peak around 5-7 mb Tuesday night
into Wednesday morning. Sustained north to northeasterly winds 15-30
mph (gusting 30-45 mph, locally up to 55 mph) will overlap minimum
humidity around 10-20 percent. Elevated to locally Critical fire
weather is likely across portions of the Transverse Ranges. HREF
guidance indicates Critical conditions will be mainly confined to
the immediate slopes/foothills, which will preclude the need for
inclusion of a Critical area at this time. This will be reevaluated
in future outlook updates.

* Effective this Sunday morning and afternoon from 830 AM until
  300 PM EST.

* Primary threats include...
  A few tornadoes possible
  Isolated damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...A particularly organized segment of an extensive
quasi-linear MCS should move across the watch area through midday,
interacting with the outflow boundary from the rest of the system. 
A threat exists for damaging to severe gusts and occasional,
embedded, potentially tornadic mesovortices.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 45 statute miles
north and south of a line from 30 miles south of Tallahassee FL to
20 miles east northeast of Jacksonville FL. For a complete depiction
of the watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS
WOU5).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

PUBLIC SEVERE WEATHER OUTLOOK  
NWS STORM PREDICTION CENTER NORMAN OK
0715 PM CST SAT DEC 28 2024

...Severe thunderstorms expected over parts of the Gulf Coast States
this evening and overnight...

* LOCATIONS...
  Central and Southern Mississippi
  Western and Central Alabama
  Southeast Louisiana

* HAZARDS...
  Widespread damaging winds, some hurricane force
  Several tornadoes, a few intense
  Isolated large hail

* SUMMARY...
  Tornadoes (some strong with at least EF-2 damage possible) and
  numerous severe/damaging wind gusts are expected this evening
  through tonight. The threat area will shift eastward across
  parts of the lower Mississippi Valley this evening, and continue
  overnight through early Sunday morning over portions of the
  Tennessee Valley, central Gulf Coast states, and western
  Georgia.

Preparedness actions...

Tornadoes at night can be particularly dangerous because they 
are usually fast-moving and difficult to see. Stay tuned to
NOAA Weather Radio, weather.gov, or other media for watches and
warnings. A tornado watch means that conditions are favorable
for tornadoes to form during the next several hours. If a tornado
warning is issued for your area, move to a place of safety,
ideally in a basement or interior room on the lowest floor of a
sturdy building.
