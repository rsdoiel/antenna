Mesoscale Discussion 1027
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0358 PM CDT Wed May 28 2025

Areas affected...central Texas

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 343...

Valid 282058Z - 282230Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 343
continues.

SUMMARY...Several supercells to persist through the afternoon with a
primary threat of large hail.

DISCUSSION...A few supercells have developed in central Texas and
have recently started to turn right. The north-easternmost storm has
recently produced baseball sized hail in Hamilton County, Texas. A
favorable environment persists south of this activity which should
maintain this threat through the afternoon and into the early
evening. Eventually, these storms may congeal as they move southeast
which would result in an increased severe wind threat. However, in
the near term, large hail is the primary threat. 

Farther southwest convective attempts continue but it remains
unclear whether additional mature supercells may develop. If they
do, a similar environment will support supercells capable of large
to very large hail, similar to the storms farther east.

Mesoscale Discussion 1026
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0338 PM CDT Wed May 28 2025

Areas affected...Parts of Far West Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 282038Z - 282215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...There is an increasing threat for large hail this
afternoon and evening across portions of Far West Texas.

DISCUSSION...SPC mesoanalysis has indicated that inhibition has
mostly eroded across portions of Far West Texas and some towers have
started to develop over the Davis Mountains. Current visible
satellite data suggests that any convection this afternoon/evening
will likely be confined to the Davis Mountain vicinity. As
destabilization continues this afternoon, expect at least one storm,
potentially a few storms, to develop over the higher terrain. RAP
forecast soundings and SPC mesoanalysis indicate effective shear
around 30 to 35 knots which could support a supercell threat. Large
hail will likely be the primary threat with storms quickly weakening
after peak heating. 

If a few strong storms develop with a threat which may persist for
several hours, a severe thunderstorm watch may be necessary, but
more than isolated coverage and a short duration threat seems
questionable at this time.

Mesoscale Discussion 1025
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0334 PM CDT Wed May 28 2025

Areas affected...Far southeast Colorado...far southwest Kansas...and
the Oklahoma Panhandle

Concerning...Tornado Watch 342...

Valid 282034Z - 282130Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 342 continues.

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms have developed in far southeastern Colorado
and the far western Oklahoma Panhandle this afternoon, with an
additional cluster of thunderstorms moving from far northwest
Kansas/eastern Colorado due southeast. These thunderstorms will be
capable of all hazards, including tornadoes -- particularly across
southern portions of WW 342 in the short term.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorms in the Oklahoma Panhandle/southwest
Kansas have developed west of an environment characterized by rich
boundary-layer moisture (mixing ratios ~13-14 g/kg), 35-40 kts of
deep-layer shear, and southeasterly surface winds. VAD wind profiles
from KDDC show some low-level curvature of the hodograph that will
support stronger low-level mesocyclones and potential tornado
development, and low-level shear is expected to increase into the
evening with the nocturnal low-level jet around and after sunset.
While convective interactions in the short term lead to some
uncertainty, the expectation is that any isolated/strong supercells
that emerge from the convective clusters will have increased tornado
potential heading into this evening. 

Further north in eastern Colorado/northwest Kansas, a cluster of
convection is moving south-southeastward through WW 342. These
storms will be moving into an increasingly unstable and sheared
environment, though current KGLD VAD wind profiles show mostly
straight-line hodographs that would favor splitting supercell
thunderstorms. These storms will be capable of all hazards, with the
threat increasing as they continue to progress south and east with
time.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 343
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
245 PM CDT Wed May 28 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Central and South-Central Texas

* Effective this Wednesday afternoon and evening from 245 PM
  until 1000 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail likely with isolated very large hail events
    to 2.5 inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...At least isolated severe storms including supercells
capable of large hail are expected this afternoon across the region,
as the air mass further destabilizes after early day storms.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 65
statute miles north and south of a line from 50 miles south
southwest of San Angelo TX to 20 miles southeast of Waco TX. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU3).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 341...WW 342...

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 600. Mean storm motion vector
29025.

Tropical Depression One-E Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP012025
300 PM CST Wed May 28 2025
 
Showers and thunderstorms associated with an area of low pressure 
have continued to become better organized over the past 12 hours. 
Some banding features have become more pronounced over the southern 
semi-circle. Recent scatterometer data depicts that the system now 
has a well-defined low-level center. Thus, the system is now 
classified as a tropical depression, the first of the eastern 
Pacific season. The initial intensity is set at 30 kt based on a 
T2.0 Dvorak classification from TAFB.
 
The initial estimated motion is northwest at 320/8 kt, although 
there is higher uncertainty in this motion given the recent 
low-level center formation. Models are in fairly good agreement 
that the system should continue northwest to north-northwest over 
the next few days within the low-level flow. Environmental 
conditions are favorable for strengthening over the next couple of 
days with warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear. After 
48 h the system is likely to enter a fairly harsh environment with 
drier mid-level air, cooler sea surface temperatures, and increasing 
wind shear which should induce a weakening trend. The latest model 
simulated IR satellite imagery shows that convection is likely to 
collapse by Saturday, and the system is forecast to become a remnant 
low and dissipate early next week.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0254 PM CDT Wed May 28 2025

Valid 291200Z - 301200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...New Mexico...
Limited mid-level moisture across the upper Rio Grande Valley in New
Mexico will keep a rather low dry thunderstorm threat across
southern and central New Mexico where fuels remain quite dry. Less
receptive fuels in addition to showers and thunderstorms on the
wetter side should limit fire spread potential along and east of the
New Mexico central mountain range.

...Northwest...
An upper-level trough entering the Pacific Northwest will bring a
cold front into the region Thursday. Dry, post-frontal flow with 
some downslope enhancement lee of the Cascades is expected in the
Columbia Basin. Although pockets of dry grasses exist across the
region, ongoing green up and ERCs in the 60-70th percentile range
will limit significant fire spread within overall fuelscape.

..Williams.. 05/28/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0124 AM CDT Wed May 28 2025/

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns will remain limited on Thursday. As a
shortwave trough clips the Pacific Northwest, westerly flow will
increase across the Cascades into the Columbia River Basin and the
Blue Mountains into the Snake River Plain in Idaho. Fuels in these
regions are not quite ready to support fire spread, but this will
likely lead to a period of drying. 

Moisture will continue to increase into New Mexico, with better
chances for wetting rainfall on Thursday. In addition, humidity will
increase with better recovery in the overnight periods. As such, no
isolated dry thunderstorm chances are needed on Thursday.

Day 1 Convective Outlook

0251 PM CDT Wed May 28 2025

Valid 282000Z - 291200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM THE CENTRAL
AND SOUTHERN PLAINS TO THE GULF COAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms capable of producing large to very large hail,
damaging wind gusts, and a few tornadoes are expected today across
parts of the southern/central Plains. Isolated wind damage may occur
across portions of the Gulf Coast and Southeast.

...20z Update...
Minimal changes were made to the prior outlook on the western edge
for ongoing convection. Scattered severe storms, currently
developing across eastern CO and northeast NM, will gradually expand
in coverage/intensity eastward across the southern and central High
Plains this afternoon/evening. Supercells with all hazards are
probable ahead of MCS development and continuation of severe
potential downstream over the southern Plains tonight.

Across the Southeast states, sporadic damaging gusts are possible as
several clusters of strong to severe storms continue eastward along
a broad frontal zone. The primary focus for locally higher damaging
gust potential remains across portions of the lower MS Valley and
Gulf Coast regions through this evening.

No changes were made to the risk areas over western and central TX,
see the prior outlook for more information.

..Lyons.. 05/28/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1134 AM CDT Wed May 28 2025/

...Eastern Colorado/Kansas to western Oklahoma/Texas Panhandles...
A closed upper low over the northern Plains and Upper Midwest will
drift slowly eastward today. A mid-level shortwave trough embedded
on the western periphery of this low will move southeastward across
the northern/central High Plains this afternoon and evening. Modest
low-level moisture return should occur over parts of the
southern/central High Plains ahead of this shortwave trough, with a
narrow zone of weak to moderate MLCAPE forecast to develop across
eastern Colorado into southwest Kansas and the Oklahoma/northern
Texas Panhandles by mid-afternoon. Multiple thunderstorms should
initiate across eastern Colorado/southwest Nebraska and vicinity by
18-21Z as large-scale ascent attendant to the shortwave trough
overspreads the developing warm sector.

Weak low-level flow is forecast to veer to west-northwesterly and
gradually strengthen with height through mid-levels. Around 30-40 kt
of deep-layer shear should support mainly supercell structures, with
an initial threat for large to isolated very large hail. With time,
a bowing complex should evolve from parts of western/southern Kansas
into northwest Oklahoma and the Oklahoma/Texas Panhandles, with a
greater threat for scattered severe winds apparent this evening. A
few tornadoes may also occur in a zone either side of the
Colorado/Kansas border into southwest Kansas, where low-level
shear/SRH should maximize early this evening.

...Western North Texas to North/Central Texas...
A remnant MCV over west Texas will drift slowly eastward today
towards north/central Texas. At least some destabilization will
occur through this afternoon along/near a remnant surface front
draped generally west to east over central Texas. Most
high-resolution guidance shows scattered thunderstorms developing by
mid-afternoon in close proximity to the MCV. Modest enhancement to
the mid-level westerlies associated with this feature should support
enough deep-layer shear for updraft organization and some
supercell/large hail potential initially. With time, a small bowing
cluster may develop and pose more of a severe wind threat through
the late afternoon and evening as convection spreads generally
east-southeastward into central Texas before eventually weakening. A
tornado or two may also occur, as low-level shear will be modestly
enhanced by the MCV.

...Far West Texas and Southeast New Mexico...
This region will remain generally displaced to the west/behind
large-scale ascent associated with an eastward-moving MCV over west
Texas, and upper troughing over the north-central states. Still,
isolated to scattered thunderstorms may develop through peak
afternoon heating across the higher terrain of the Davis/Guadalupe
Mountains and vicinity with large hail as the primary hazard.

...Upper Texas Coast to Lower Mississippi Valley/Southeast...
A loosely organized complex of storms across east Texas and upper
Texas coast should drift eastward, with additional
development/intensification this afternoon preceding it to the east.
While locally damaging winds will be possible across a broad
regional extent, a somewhat more focused potential for wind damage
may exist within a very moist air mass and instability gradient
(largely influenced by storms in prior days) across southern

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0226 PM CDT Wed May 28 2025

Valid 301200Z - 311200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR PARTS OF THE
SOUTHEAST AND SOUTHERN MID-ATLANTIC...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe storms with wind damage, large hail, and a few
tornadoes will be possible Friday afternoon through late Friday
evening across parts of the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast.

...Mid-Atlantic and Southeast...
Pattern amplification will occur Friday as one shortwave trough
progresses from the Mid-South to the southeast Atlantic/Mid-Atlantic
coast, in advance of another wave digging southward over the Great
Lakes.  An associated surface cyclone will develop
east-northeastward across the Mid-Atlantic late Friday and to the
southern New England coast by Saturday morning, while a trailing
cold front crosses the Gulf coast, north FL and the southeast
Atlantic coast.  Within cloud breaks the warm sector will consist of
afternoon temperatures near or above 80 F and boundary-layer
dewpoints in the 60s, which will drive MLCAPE of 1000-2000+ J/kg and
minimal convective inhibition by early-mid afternoon.  Increasing
midlevel flow with time and forcing for ascent along and just ahead
of the front will support storm initiation with the potential for
storm clusters and some supercells capable of producing damaging
winds, large hail and a few tornadoes.  If wave timing and
thermodynamic profiles remain favorable, some portion of this area
may warrant an upgrade in later updates.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THURSDAY AFTERNOON
THROUGH EARLY THURSDAY NIGHT FROM THE TEXAS-NEW MEXICO BORDER INTO
CENTRAL TEXAS...

CORRECTED FOR DAY REFERENCES

...SUMMARY...
Large hail and damaging winds will be possible from the Texas-New
Mexico border eastward into central Texas.

...TX late Thursday afternoon into Thursday night...
A midlevel shortwave trough will move southeastward over the lower
MO Valley/Ozarks, as an associated surface cold front likewise moves
across MO/AR/OK/TX in the wake of weak cyclogenesis from southern MO
to the lower OH Valley.  The warmest surface temperatures and
steepest midlevel lapse rates are expected in the pre-frontal
corridor from west central into central TX, where MLCAPE will likely
exceed 2500 J/kg.  Strong surface heating/mixing will erode
convective inhibition and at least widely scattered thunderstorm
development appears probable along and just south of the front by
late afternoon across west central TX.  Storms will then spread
east-southeastward toward central TX through the early overnight
hours.  The strong buoyancy and sufficiently long hodographs
(effective bulk shear of 35-45 kt) will support supercells capable
of producing isolated very large hail initially.  Upscale growth
into one or more clusters is also expected during the evening, with
an attendant threat for damaging winds.  A couple of tornadoes may
also occur with the initial supercells and/or favorable storm
interactions.  

...Mid-South Thursday evening...
With weak cyclogenesis expected across southern MO in advance of the
midlevel shortwave trough, weak low-level mass response and
northward moisture transport will occur from eastern AR to the
confluence of the MS/OH Rivers.  Midlevel lapse rate will not be
steep, but destabilization will be sufficient for a broken band of
storms near and south of the surface cyclone track.  Forecast wind
profiles suggest some potential for rotating storms with a low-end
threat for wind damage and a couple of tornadoes.

...Southeast Thursday afternoon/evening...
A moist boundary layer and daytime heating along and south of a
residual baroclinic zone will likely support at least scattered
thunderstorm development Thursday afternoon from southeast AL/FL
Panhandle across southern/central GA.  There is some potential for a
remnant, convectively enhanced midlevel trough to cross this area
during peak heating, and an upgrade to SLGT risk/15% wind
probabilities may become necessary in later updates.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1141 AM CDT Wed May 28 2025

Valid 281700Z - 291200Z

...Rio Grande Valley/Central New Mexico...
Little change in mid/upper-level thermodynamic profiles, residual
mid-level moisture plume over central New Mexico and slightly
increased dewpoints across southern New Mexico along with daytime
heating, will support a few high-based thunderstorms this afternoon.
Area of isolated dry thunderstorms was maintained across
western/central New Mexico, with a slight reduction on the western
extent of threat as a drier boundary layer pushes eastward through
the day.

..Williams.. 05/28/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0122 AM CDT Wed May 28 2025/

...Synopsis...
Mid-level moisture can be seen increasing on water vapor imagery
this morning across western New Mexico. Guidance suggests that this
increase in moisture will lead to an increase in thunderstorm
activity this afternoon, with the best chances across
eastern/central New Mexico. On the periphery of this better
moisture, a few high-based dry thunderstorms will be possible. This
will be mainly tied to the terrain. Storm motions should be quite
slow, but precipitable water values <0.50" and very dry boundary
layer conditions should yield little to no measurable precipitation.
An area of isolated dry thunderstorm risk was maintained with this
outlook.

Valid 281630Z - 291200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE CENTRAL
AND SOUTHERN PLAINS TO GULF COAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms capable of producing large to very large hail,
damaging wind gusts, and a few tornadoes should occur today across
parts of the southern/central Plains. Isolated wind damage may occur
across portions of the Gulf Coast and Southeast.

...Eastern Colorado/Kansas to western Oklahoma/Texas Panhandles...
A closed upper low over the northern Plains and Upper Midwest will
drift slowly eastward today. A mid-level shortwave trough embedded
on the western periphery of this low will move southeastward across
the northern/central High Plains this afternoon and evening. Modest
low-level moisture return should occur over parts of the
southern/central High Plains ahead of this shortwave trough, with a
narrow zone of weak to moderate MLCAPE forecast to develop across
eastern Colorado into southwest Kansas and the Oklahoma/northern
Texas Panhandles by mid-afternoon. Multiple thunderstorms should
initiate across eastern Colorado/southwest Nebraska and vicinity by
18-21Z as large-scale ascent attendant to the shortwave trough
overspreads the developing warm sector.

Weak low-level flow is forecast to veer to west-northwesterly and
gradually strengthen with height through mid-levels. Around 30-40 kt
of deep-layer shear should support mainly supercell structures, with
an initial threat for large to isolated very large hail. With time,
a bowing complex should evolve from parts of western/southern Kansas
into northwest Oklahoma and the Oklahoma/Texas Panhandles, with a
greater threat for scattered severe winds apparent this evening. A
few tornadoes may also occur in a zone either side of the
Colorado/Kansas border into southwest Kansas, where low-level
shear/SRH should maximize early this evening.

...Western North Texas to North/Central Texas...
A remnant MCV over west Texas will drift slowly eastward today
towards north/central Texas. At least some destabilization will
occur through this afternoon along/near a remnant surface front
draped generally west to east over central Texas. Most
high-resolution guidance shows scattered thunderstorms developing by
mid-afternoon in close proximity to the MCV. Modest enhancement to
the mid-level westerlies associated with this feature should support
enough deep-layer shear for updraft organization and some
supercell/large hail potential initially. With time, a small bowing
cluster may develop and pose more of a severe wind threat through
the late afternoon and evening as convection spreads generally
east-southeastward into central Texas before eventually weakening. A
tornado or two may also occur, as low-level shear will be modestly
enhanced by the MCV.

...Far West Texas and Southeast New Mexico...
This region will remain generally displaced to the west/behind
large-scale ascent associated with an eastward-moving MCV over west
Texas, and upper troughing over the north-central states. Still,
isolated to scattered thunderstorms may develop through peak
afternoon heating across the higher terrain of the Davis/Guadalupe
Mountains and vicinity with large hail as the primary hazard.

...Upper Texas Coast to Lower Mississippi Valley/Southeast...
A loosely organized complex of storms across east Texas and upper
Texas coast should drift eastward, with additional
development/intensification this afternoon preceding it to the east.
While locally damaging winds will be possible across a broad
regional extent, a somewhat more focused potential for wind damage
may exist within a very moist air mass and instability gradient
(largely influenced by storms in prior days) across southern
portions of Louisiana and Mississippi.

across portions of the Gulf Coast/Southeast.

...Eastern Colorado into Kansas, the Oklahoma/Texas Panhandles, and
Western Oklahoma...
A closed upper low over the northern Plains and Upper Midwest will
drift slowly eastward today. A mid-level shortwave trough embedded
on the western periphery of this low will move southeastward across
the northern/central High Plains this afternoon and evening. Modest
low-level moisture return should occur over parts of the
southern/central High Plains ahead of this shortwave trough, with a
narrow zone of weak to moderate MLCAPE forecast to develop across
eastern CO into southwest KS and the OK/northern TX Panhandles by
mid afternoon. Multiple thunderstorms should initiate across eastern
CO/southwest NE and vicinity by 18-21Z as large-scale ascent
attendant to the shortwave trough overspreads the developing warm
sector. Weak low-level flow is forecast to veer to
west-northwesterly and gradually strengthen with height through mid
levels. Around 30-40 kt of deep-layer shear should support mainly
supercell structures, with an initial threat for large to isolated
very large hail. With time, a bowing complex should evolve from
parts of western/southern KS into northwest OK and the OK/TX
Panhandles, with a greater threat for scattered severe winds
apparent this evening. A few tornadoes may also occur in a narrow
zone across southwest KS and vicinity where low-level shear should
be maximized along a warm front late this afternoon/early evening,
especially if a semi-discrete mode can be maintained.

...Western North Texas into North/Central Texas...
A remnant MCV over west TX will drift slowly eastward today towards
north/central TX. While convection occurred yesterday and is still
ongoing this morning across parts of this region, it appears likely
that at least some destabilization will occur through this afternoon
along/near a remnant surface front draped generally west to east
over central TX. Most high-resolution guidance shows scattered
thunderstorms developing by 18-20Z in close proximity to the MCV.
Modest enhancement to the mid-level westerlies associated with this
feature should support enough deep-layer shear for updraft
organization and some supercell/large hail potential initially. With
time, a small bowing cluster may develop and pose more of a severe
wind threat through the late afternoon and evening as convection
spreads generally east-southeastward into central TX before
eventually weakening. A tornado or two may also occur, as low-level
shear will be modestly enhanced the by MCV. Based on recent guidance
trends, the Slight Risk has been expanded southeastward to include
more of central TX.

...Far West Texas and Southeast New Mexico...
This region will remain generally displaced to the west/behind
large-scale ascent associated with an eastward-moving MCV over west
TX, and upper troughing over the north-central states. Still,
isolated to scattered thunderstorms may develop through peak
afternoon heating across the higher terrain of the Davis/Guadalupe
Mountains and vicinity. Hail/wind may occur with any of the stronger
cores that can be sustained. Have maintained the Slight Risk for
hail over parts of this area. But, confidence in overall severe
thunderstorm coverage is low, as low-level upslope flow is forecast
to be weaker compared to yesterday.

...Deep South Texas...
With an unstable airmass remaining in place across deep south TX, a
small cluster of thunderstorms near the lower TX Coast may continue
to pose a severe/damaging wind threat for another hour or two this
morning before moving offshore.

...Middle/Upper Texas Coast into the Lower Mississippi
Valley/Southeast...
A broad and rather unfocused zone of marginal/isolated severe
potential remains apparent downstream of ongoing convection this
morning across the middle TX Coast and central TX vicinity. A
weak/convectively enhanced mid-level shortwave trough will advance
northeastward from central/east TX across parts of the lower MS
Valley through the afternoon and evening. As modest large-scale
ascent associated with this feature overspreads a gradually
destabilizing warm sector, a band of convection may develop across
LA/MS with some risk for hail and damaging winds. Severe potential
across the remainder of the Southeast along/near a stalled front is
even less clear owing to weak large-scale forcing. Still, a
conditional threat for strong/gusty winds may exist with any
convection that can form through peak afternoon heating as low-level
lapse rates slowly steepen.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0400 AM CDT Wed May 28 2025

Valid 311200Z - 051200Z

...DISCUSSION...
...Saturday/Day 4 and Sunday/Day 5...
From Saturday into Sunday, a mid-level shortwave trough is forecast
to move from the central Plains into the Southeast. Instability is
not forecast be particularly strong head of the trough. However,
large-scale ascent will support scattered thunderstorm development
on Saturday in parts of the central Plains and Ozarks, and on Sunday
from east Texas into the lower Mississippi Valley. Deep-layer shear
should be adequate for isolated severe thunderstorm development. The
threat is expected to be marginal.

...Monday/Day 6 to Wednesday/Day 8...
During the early week period, a mid-level ridge is forecast to move
across the central U.S., as a shortwave trough moves through the
Desert Southwest. Ahead of this feature, low-level moisture will
increase across the Great Plains, as low-level flow strengthens in
the wake of the ridge. Surface dewpoints are expected to increase
into the 60s F across much of the Great Plains, which should allow
for moderate to strong destabilization in some areas during the
afternoon. Although large-scale ascent will generally be weak across
most of the Great Plains, thunderstorm development will be possible
Monday afternoon over parts of the High Plains. An isolated severe
threat could develop late Monday afternoon into the evening along
the western edge of the stronger instability from eastern New
Mexico, northward into western South Dakota.

During the mid week, the shortwave trough is forecast to move across
the central U.S. on Tuesday and into the Great Lakes on Wednesday.
Thunderstorm development is expected across an unstable airmass,
which is forecast to be located in the Great Plains. Forecast
instability and deep-layer shear suggest a severe threat will be
possible in areas that have sufficient large-scale forcing, although
confidence is low concerning any potential scenario. If model runs
maintain consistency and show more agreement among solutions over
the next couple of runs, a 15 percent area may be needed in parts of
the Great Plains during the early to mid week.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 336
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
505 AM CDT Tue May 27 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  East and Southeast Louisiana
  Southern and Central Mississippi
  Coastal Waters

* Effective this Tuesday morning and afternoon from 505 AM until
  100 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...A small bowing cluster of thunderstorms should continue to
pose some threat for scattered damaging winds this morning into the
early afternoon. Isolated hail may occur with cells ahead of the
cluster, and a brief tornado also appears possible with circulations
embedded within the line.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 75
statute miles north and south of a line from 50 miles southwest of
Natchez MS to 50 miles east of Pine Belt MS. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU6).

0348 PM CDT Sun May 25 2025

Areas affected...TX Panhandle

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 252048Z - 252315Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Convective Initiation along a frontal zone appears
increasingly likely between 4-7pm CDT (21-00z).  Large hail appears
to be the primary threat, although the risk for severe gusts will
increase during the evening.

DISCUSSION...Visible-satellite imagery shows a gradual clumping of
cumulus along a front draped from southwest to northeast across the
TX Panhandle.  A patch of cirrus over eastern NM appears associated
with the leading edge of appreciable large-scale ascent from a
Desert Southwest upper trough.  As continued heating of a
moist/destabilizing boundary layer occurs this this afternoon,
expecting additional erosion of convective inhibition along the
boundary.  Modifying the 18z Amarillo raob for lower 80s deg F
temperatures and lower 60s dewpoints, yields around 2400 J/kg MLCAPE
and minimal MLCINH (-35 J/kg).  

Models continue to vary regarding timing/coverage of storm
development within this mesoscale corridor.  However, cloud trends
and forecaster experience imply at least isolated to widely
scattered storm development over the next 3 or so hours.  Depending
on timing/coverage of developing storms, a severe thunderstorm watch
will be considered.

0333 PM CDT Sun May 25 2025

Areas affected...much of Arkansas into southern Tennessee and
northern Mississippi

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 322...

Valid 252033Z - 252200Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 322
continues.

SUMMARY...The severe risk continues across much of WW322. Damaging
winds remain the primary threat though some hail with more scattered
convection is also possible.

DISCUSSION...As of 2030 UTC, regional radar imagery showed gradual
intensification of the ongoing convective cluster across
northwestern portions of WW322. Continued upscale growth of this
cluster is likely this afternoon/evening as the expanding cold pool
continues to interact with a broad warm and unstable air mass south
of the East-West stationary front. The expectation continues to be
for one or more bowing clusters to emerge from this convection, and
spread eastward with a risk for damaging winds and perhaps an
embedded tornado or two.

Additional, more scattered, convection has also developed across
much of the warm sector this afternoon. Given the robust buoyancy
(3,000 J/kg of MLCAPE), some hail and occasional damaging winds are
also possible with these storms. However, the main risk is still
expected to be the broader complex over AR/TN maturing later into
the evening. Given the gradual intensification/organization, the
severe threat will continue to increase across much of WW322.

Areas affected...northeast NM

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 251924Z - 252130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Storm development will initially focus near the higher
terrain before moving east atop the escarpment/plains.  Large
hail/severe gusts are possible.

DISCUSSION...Visible-satellite imagery shows towering cumulus over
the Sangre de Cristos and a swelling cumulus field along the I-25
corridor in a post-frontal regime.  Surface analysis indicates
temperatures have warmed into the mid 60s to lower 70s deg F with
upper 40s to lower 50s dewpoints.  Short-term model forecast
soundings and RAP-based Objective Analysis imply 750-1500 J/kg
MLCAPE across northeast NM.  A belt of 35-40 kt southwesterly 500-mb
flow will support storm organization as storms develop/mature into
slightly richer moisture with eastward movement later this
afternoon.  A few of the stronger storms may attain supercellular
characteristics and pose a risk for large hail.  Severe gusts could
become more prevalent if/once storms cluster and congeal east of
I-25 during the early evening before low-level lapse rates lessen
with the loss of heating.

Mesoscale Discussion 0970
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0215 PM CDT Sun May 25 2025

Areas affected...Atlantic Coast portions of SC and GA into the FL
Panhandle.

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 251915Z - 252115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered thunderstorms along multiple sea-breeze
boundaries will support a risk for occasional damaging gusts or
sporadic hail this afternoon. A WW is not expected.

DISCUSSION...As of 1915 UTC, regional radar and satellite showed
scattered to numerous thunderstorms erupting along the Atlantic
Coasts of GA and SC, extending southward across much of the FL
Peninsula. Driven largely by diurnal heating and localized
confluence along typical sea-breeze boundaries, a few stronger
multicells/clusters have been noted recently. With little in the way
of upper-level forcing for ascent, convection has been largely
unorganized and is expected to remain as such. However, additional
clustering may support stronger cold pool development with time.
This could allow for occasional damaging gusts and wet microbursts
given the high PWATs (~1.8-2 inches) air mass. Sporadic hail is also
possible with the more intense updrafts given around 2000 J/kg of
MLCAPE. While occasional damaging gusts and hail are possible, the
lack of broader upper-level support suggests the severe risk will be
transient/isolated. A WW is not expected this afternoon.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 321
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1145 PM CDT Sat May 24 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Far Northwest Arkansas

  until 700 AM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2
    inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm coverage is expected to increase tonight
across northern OK into southern KS and adjacent portions of far
northwest AR and far southwest MO. Steep mid-level lapse rates and
strong vertical shear will support the potential for large hail.
Isolated damaging gusts are also possible, particularly across
southwestern KS where a potential bowing segment may move into the
region from the northwest.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 55
statute miles north and south of a line from 20 miles west southwest
of Garden City KS to 30 miles east of Grove OK. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU1).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.
