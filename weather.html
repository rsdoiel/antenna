Mesoscale Discussion 2161
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0907 AM CDT Wed Oct 30 2024

Areas affected...central/northern Kansas into southeast Nebraska

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 301407Z - 301530Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Elevated storms capable of some large hail are possible
this morning from portions of central Kansas into southeast
Nebraska.

DISCUSSION...Lightning has increased across central Kansas as ascent
increases across the Plains within a moderately unstable
environment. The TOP 12Z RAOB indicated around 1300 J/kg MUCAPE and
continued low-level moisture advection and mid-level cooling should
increase instability as the morning progresses. Effective shear was
actually quite weak at 12Z with a 60 knot low-level jet near the
low-level jet and 60 knots at 7km with weaker flow between this
layer. However, as the mid-level jet streak approaches the region
and nocturnal influences of the low-level jet reduce, a more
favorable, gradually increasing wind profile with height is expected
to develop by late morning to early afternoon. As instability and
the wind profile improve, eventually expect some supercells to
develop along or slightly on the cool side of the cold front.
Isolated large hail will be the primary threat from this activity
later this morning and into the early afternoon. A watch likely will
not be needed in the short term.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0750 AM CDT Wed Oct 30 2024

Valid 301300Z - 311200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR PORTIONS
EASTERN KANSAS...NORTHEAST OKLAHOMA...AND NORTHWEST MISSOURI...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms capable of producing large hail, damaging wind
gusts, and a few tornadoes, are expected today into tonight across
the middle Missouri Valley and central/southern Plains, including
parts of eastern Kansas and Oklahoma into Missouri.

...Lower Missouri Valley/South-Central Plains...
A relatively active severe-weather day is expected regionally,
especially late this afternoon into evening, including some southern
Plains areas in which there hasn't been severe-weather potential in
over a month.

The lead portion of an upper-level trough centered over the
central/southern Rockies this morning will eject northeastward over
the central Plains toward broader parts of the Upper Midwest and
Corn Belt. A surface wave will evolve across the eastern Texas
Panhandle/northwest Oklahoma vicinity. From this low, an
east/southeastward-moving cold front will extend across Kansas into
Iowa/Minnesota and eventually Wisconsin/western Missouri by this
evening, with this front overtaking a dryline across the southern
High Plains.

Some severe-weather potential may increase as early as late morning
into midday near the cold front across central Kansas into southeast
Nebraska and Iowa, with a likely increase in surface-rooted
convection and greater severe potential by mid/late afternoon as the
front approaches east-central/northeast Kansas and northwest
Missouri/southern Iowa. Pre-convective MLCAPE values should reach
500-1250 J/kg within this corridor, with very strong deep-layer
southwesterly winds supporting 40-50 kt effective shear and fast
east-northeastward storm motions, which will largely parallel the
front and its east-southeastward motion. Some severe hail will be
possible during the day, but damaging winds and some tornado
potential will be more prevalent into late afternoon and evening as
a QLCS evolves with embedded bowing segments and potential
mesovortices. 

Farther south, in closer proximity to the surface wave, somewhat
more discrete thunderstorm development is expected across
south-central/east-central Kansas including the I-35/135 corridors
and north-central Oklahoma, with prospects for even more isolated
initial supercellular development by around sunset southward into
central/southern Oklahoma and North Texas. Surface temperatures in
the upper 70s F, combined with mid 60s F dewpoints, will contribute
to 1500-2000 J/kg MLCAPE by peak heating. Storms that develop/mature
in this environment will likely be supercells in the presence of 45+
effective shear, highlighted by a dramatic strengthening (50-65 kt)
of 2-3 km AGL (surface-700 mb) southwesterly winds toward/after
sunset. Storm mergers will result in squall line development over
time, with a longer duration of more discrete development with
southward extent across Oklahoma. A few tornadoes are plausible
regionally, and a strong tornado or two could occur, particularly
within a couple of hours of sunset. The severe threat should
transition to more of a damaging wind threat as the squall line
matures, although line-embedded QLCS tornadoes will remain possible
this evening, and possibly overnight.

...Southeast Texas...
There is some potential that a few stronger/potentially rotating
storms could materialize today across the region within a very moist
and confluent low-level flow regime. This would be as low-level
lapse rates diurnally steepen coincident with a moderate degree of
low-level hodograph length and curvature. Modest-strength winds
above 2km AGL should limit the sustainability and intensity for any
showers/thunderstorms that may exhibit rotating characteristics, and
the overall severe potential should remain limited.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0357 AM CDT Mon Oct 28 2024

Valid 311200Z - 051200Z

...DISCUSSION...
...Thursday/Day 4 to Saturday/Day 6...
An upper-level trough is forecast to move eastward into the upper
Mississippi Valley on Thursday, and into the Northeast on Friday. At
the surface, a cold front is forecast to advance southeastward into
the Gulf Coast states. Thunderstorm development will be likely near
and ahead of the front Thursday afternoon and evening. Weak
instability and limited large-scale ascent should keep any severe
threat marginal.

From Friday into Saturday, low-level moisture return is expected to
take place further west into the southern Plains. Thunderstorms are
forecast to develop on Friday over parts of eastern New Mexico and
west Texas, with an isolated severe threat possible. On Saturday,
moisture and instability is forecast to increase across the southern
and central Plains, which could result in an expansion of severe
threat coverage. However, the latest models suggest that instability
will be relatively weak in most areas, helping to marginalize the
severe threat.

...Sunday/Day 7 and Monday/Day 8...
On Sunday and Monday, an upper-level system is forecast to move from
near the southern California coast into northwestern Mexico. Ahead
of the system, an anticyclonic and subtle southwesterly mid-level
flow pattern is forecast in the south-central U.S, where a moist
airmass should be located. Isolated to scattered thunderstorms are
expected to develop on both Sunday and Monday afternoons with this
airmass. The strongest instability is forecast to be near the
western edge of the moist airmass, suggesting the greatest severe
potential could be from west Texas extending north-northeastward
into the central Plains. Forecast instability should be relatively
weak, keeping any severe threat marginal.
