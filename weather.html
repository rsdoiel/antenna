Mesoscale Discussion 0446
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0351 PM CDT Fri Apr 11 2025

Areas affected...northern Florida

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 112051Z - 112315Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Several storms may produce small hail and locally gusty
winds through late afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Surface temperatures have risen into the upper 70s to
near 80 F this afternoon, as temperatures aloft continue to cool. A
very steep lapse rate environment has developed with 500 mb
temperature to -20 C into parts of the FL Panhandle and northern FL.


A few thunderstorms have already formed along the surface trough
extending from the Panhandle into extreme southeast GA, with
indications of small/non-severe hail. Moisture is the limiting
factor to storm severity today, with low dewpoints spreading
southward. Even so, convective coverage may continue to increase
over the next couple hours as lapse rates are maximized. Although
low PWAT overall, the deepened boundary layer along with low
freezing levels and lengthy hodographs will work together to produce
primarily non-severe hail. Boundary layer winds remain relatively
weak, therefore any strong to potentially damaging gust would likely
be localized (but possibly aided by cold hail-laden outflow).

Day 3 Convective Outlook CORR 1
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0322 AM CDT Fri Apr 11 2025

Valid 131200Z - 141200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

CORRECTED FOR GRAPHIC

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected on Sunday or Sunday night.

...Upper MS Valley/Great Lakes...
A shortwave trough over the northern High Plains on Sunday morning
is expected to amplify as it moves east into the northern Upper
Midwest. This will maintain a deep surface cyclone from the central
Great Plains into the Upper Great Lakes. Guidance has above-average
spread across latest runs and poor run-to-run continuity on
placement of the cyclone Sunday afternoon. This will be crucial to
identifying a mesoscale corridor of surface-based severe threat,
given initially poor quality boundary-layer moisture relative to a
pronounced EML. The slower guidance with more northern
destabilization suggests that low-end severe potential is plausible
across a portion of the Upper MS Valley. Otherwise, rounds of
elevated convection are anticipated through the period within a
broad but persistent low-level warm theta-e advection regime.
Buoyancy should remain weak and be a limiting factor for large hail.

...CO/KS...
Atop an intensifying surface ridge nosing down the High Plains, a
favorably diffluent upper-level flow regime will become prevalent by
late afternoon Sunday and persist into Sunday night. This should
support a corridor of convection from CO into KS, that becomes
increasingly elevated given the undercutting surface front. Guidance
has above-average spread on the latitudinal extent of where
convection should form, yielding a broad low-probability thunder
area in this forecast.

Mesoscale Discussion 0442
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0345 PM CDT Thu Apr 10 2025

Areas affected...eastern Tennessee...northern Georgia...extreme
western Carolinas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 102045Z - 102245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered storms, a few of which may be severe, are likely
to affect parts of northern Georgia and eastern Tennessee, and
possibly into the far western Carolinas by early evening.

DISCUSSION...Storms continue to increase across TN, beneath the
cooler midlevel temperatures. Meanwhile, a midlevel cloud band has
moved out of the region, allowing heating behind. Given this
expected destabilization via heating and advection out of the west,
cells moving into the region are expected to remain strong or
severe, producing hail and localized wind gusts. The greatest risk
of damaging hail will be over southern areas, including northern GA,
where temperatures have warmed substantially and lapse rates are
quite steep.

Mesoscale Discussion 0441
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0256 PM CDT Thu Apr 10 2025

Areas affected...primarily from northern Mississippi into central
and northern Alabama

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 101956Z - 102230Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Storms are expected to develop later this afternoon and
evening, with large hail and localized damaging gusts likely.

DISCUSSION...Surface analysis shows a boundary/wind shift moving
south across AR and toward the MS River. Ahead of this boundary,
west/southwest winds are helping to maintain a plume of mid 50s F
dewpoints which now extend into AL. Meanwhile, strong heating
continues.

The southerly periphery of the midlevel cooling is evident on
visible imagery, indicated by the CU fields from northeast AR into
TN.  As this cooling aloft rapidly pushes southeast, corridors of
thunderstorm development are expected. The combination of strong
cooling aloft overspreading the surface theta-e plume should result
in corridors of severe storms. Long hodographs, cold temperatures
aloft, and favorable time of day coincident with peak heating will
favor both large hail and localized wind damage. Isolated
significant hail cannot be ruled out with the strongest cells.

Mesoscale Discussion 0438
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0347 PM CDT Mon Apr 07 2025

Areas affected...Central/southeast Georgia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 072047Z - 072145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Some increase in convection may be sustained along the
deeper wind shift/cold front, but severe storms appear unlikely.

DISCUSSION...West of the pre-frontal convection, a recent increase
in updraft depth/intensity has occurred across central GA.  This
deepening convection appears to be along the deeper wind shift, with
a band of ascent impinging on residual moisture in the wake of
earlier convection.  However, the prior convection cooled surface
temperatures, lapse rates are poor, and vertical shear has
weakened/become more unidirectional with time, and shear vectors are
primarily parallel to the line orientation.  Thus, the storms are
expected to remain largely sub-severe, and an additional watch or
watch extension appears unnecessary.

Mesoscale Discussion 0437
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0335 PM CDT Mon Apr 07 2025

Areas affected...parts of NC SC and southern VA

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 134...

Valid 072035Z - 072130Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 134
continues.

SUMMARY...The damaging wind threat continues across WW134, primarily
with the band of storms moving over eastern NC and southern VA.
However, additional storms remain possible farther south.

DISCUSSION...As of 2040 UTC, regional radar imagery shows an
organized linear cluster of thunderstorms ongoing from far
southeastern VA into eastern NC. Over the last 2 hours, several
reports of wind damage, and measured severe gusts have been reported
with the line segment across parts of VA and NC. This appears likely
to continue to the coast as the line segment moves east-northeast at
50 kt.

Farther south, lingering cloud cover has resulted in only isolated
weak convection and showers across parts of SC. Some recent CA
guidance suggests a few stronger cells may eventually emerge closer
to the coast where heating has been more pronounced. A damaging wind
gusts threat could evolve with any deeper connective cells that
become established in the next couple of hours as the primary cold
front continues to shift east.

Areas affected...parts of swrn through e cntrl GA...wrn and cntrl SC

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 071240Z - 071445Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...At least low probabilities for an additional tornado or
two and/or locally damaging surface gusts continues in scattered
thunderstorm activity overspread the region through 10-11 AM EDT. 
It is still not clear that a severe weather watch is needed in the
near term, but trends will continue to be monitored for this
possibility.

DISCUSSION...Stronger boundary-layer instability, characterized by
CAPE near or above 1000 J/kg, still remains confined to a narrow
pre-frontal corridor across the western Florida Panhandle through
southwestern into southern portions of central GA.  However, some
cooling loft appears to be contributing to at least weak
destabilization north-northeastward toward the South Carolina
Piedmont.

The front, with a couple of weak waves along it, will continue a
slow eastward progression through mid to late morning, with the
Rapid Refresh indicating that a moderate south-southwesterly
low-level jet (in excess of 40 kt around 850 mb) will maintain
sizable, clockwise-curved low-level hodographs within the
instability axis.

Cloud cover spreading downstream of the stronger ongoing convective
development probably will slow boundary-layer destabilization, and
it is not certain that there will be a substantive further increase
in thunderstorm intensities in the near term.  However, the MCV,
which apparently recently contributed to a tornado south-southwest
of the Greater Atlanta area, continues east-northeastward toward the
South Carolina Piedmont, and it not clear that the downstream
environment will not support an additional relatively short-lived
tornado or two.  Farther south, in the corridor of better
instability, focused along the low-level jet axis near/north and
east of the Albany into Macon vicinities, there may also be
continuing potential for short-lived intensification of
meso-vortices embedded with the ongoing narrow band of convection.

Mesoscale Discussion 0428
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0348 PM CDT Sun Apr 06 2025

Areas affected...parts of southern AL...southwest/central GA...into
the western FL Panhandle

Concerning...Tornado Watch 132...

Valid 062048Z - 062215Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 132 continues.

SUMMARY...Several bands of strong to severe storms will remain
capable of damaging gusts and a couple tornadoes. Some local
extensions of WW132 may be needed, but the downstream threat appears
more limited.

DISCUSSION...As of 2040 UTC, regional radar observations indicate a
band of convection across southeastern AL and west-central GA
continues to show embedded supercell and bowing structures capable
of damaging gusts and tornadoes. This should continue for a couple
more hours as storms approach the eastern edge of the Tornado Watch
132. Areal extensions of a few counties may be needed as storms
begin to outrun the watch. As storms continue farther east, a
gradual decrease in buoyancy should favor weakening into the evening
hours. Until then, damaging gusts and a couple tornadoes remain
possible.

To the southwest, a second smaller band of convection across
southern AL will likely maintain intensity for a few more hours this
afternoon. A few more isolated cells have also developed farther
east within the warm sector across southwest GA and the northern FL
Panhandle. 1500-2000 J/kg of MLCAPE and 40+ kt of effective shear
could support a continued severe threat into this evening. This
matches with some hi-res guidance that shows a gradual expansion of
strong storms into southwest GA and possibly northern FL. However,
forcing for ascent is some what nebulous and storm coverage has
remained more isolated thus far. With storms approaching the
southeast corner of WW132 in the next few hours, some consideration
may be given to a small downstream watch. However the extent of the
severe risk and need for any new watches is currently unclear.

Mesoscale Discussion 0425
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0734 AM CDT Sun Apr 06 2025

Areas affected...parts of sern MS through cntrl AL

Concerning...Tornado Watch 131...

Valid 061234Z - 061430Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 131 continues.

SUMMARY...Convection may continue to undergo further organization
and intensification through 9-10 AM CDT, accompanied by increasing
risk for strong surface gusts, and a continuing risk for tornadoes.

DISCUSSION...At least a bit broader, lower/mid-tropospheric cyclonic
circulation appears to be evolving, perhaps including a surface
meso-low now migrating east-northeastward into/across the Demopolis
AL vicinity.  Latest Rapid Refresh now indicates a more prominent
south-southwesterly speed maximum associated with this feature,
including 50+ kt in the 850-700 mb layer.  Although moisture
characterized by mid 60s+ surface dew points across central Alabama,
between Montgomery and Birmingham still appear to supporting only
modest CAPE (around 500 J/kg sampled in 12Z BMX sounding), low-level
moisture advection and at least some boundary layer warming are
likely to contribute to further destabilization in advance of the
convection during the next few hours.  Inflow of this air mass may
be sufficient to support at least a gradual further intensification
of activity during the next few hours, accompanied by increasing
potential for strong surface gusts and a few tornadoes. 

Discrete thunderstorm development is also being maintained near/just
ahead of the southern flank of the evolving convective system, and
the occasional intensification of these cells, before merging into
the line, may also be accompanied by increasing potential for a
tornado near the Selma/Montgomery vicinities through mid morning.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 131
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
245 AM CDT Sun Apr 6 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Central and Southwest Alabama
  Northwest Georgia
  Far Southeast Mississippi

* Effective this Sunday morning from 245 AM until 1000 AM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A couple tornadoes possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms continue to gradually move southeastward
across the Southeast States. Low-level wind fields remain strong,
supporting the potential for damaging gusts and line-embedded
tornadoes. Additionally, there is also some chance for a few storms
ahead of the main line. Environmental conditions suggest that any
persistent discrete storms could become supercellular and capable of
producing damaging gusts and tornadoes.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 45 statute miles
north and south of a line from 135 miles southwest of Birmingham AL
to 15 miles southeast of Rome GA. For a complete depiction of the
watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU1).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 128...WW 129...WW 130...

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 1.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 60 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean
storm motion vector 24035.

Mesoscale Discussion 0416
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0314 PM CDT Sat Apr 05 2025

Areas affected...far northeast Louisiana...northern Mississippi and
northwest Alabama.

Concerning...Tornado Watch 122...

Valid 052014Z - 052215Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 122 continues.

SUMMARY...A line of storms with embedded supercells continues across
eastern portions of watch 122. A downstream tornado watch will
eventually be needed across northeast Louisiana, northern/central
Mississippi and northwest Alabama.

DISCUSSION...A line of storms with embedded supercells is slowly
drifting east near the Arkansas/Mississippi border. SPC mesoanalysis
shows 2500 J/kg MLCAPE ahead of this activity with 50 to 60 knots of
effective shear. This will support a continued threat for supercells
capable of all severe weather hazards. The JAN VWP currently shows a
relatively straight low-level hodograph where deeper mixing has
occurred. However, winds have remained more backed across northern
Mississippi where some sheltering from upper-level clouds has
occurred. Expect low-level shear to strengthen later this evening as
the low-level jet intensifies closer to 00Z. This cluster of
supercells across southeast Arkansas may eventually congeal into
another bowing segment across northern Mississippi with an increased
severe wind threat this afternoon. 

In addition, scattered showers have developed across central
Mississippi within the unstable, uncapped airmass. Most of the
activity has not had any lightning, indicating it is relatively
shallow within the deep moist layer shown by the 12Z JAN RAOB.
Recently some lightning has been observed with the deeper storms
across eastern Mississippi. It is still unclear whether this
activity will congeal into one more more supercells this
afternoon/evening. If a mature supercell can develop, the
environment would support all severe weather hazards including the
potential for a strong tornado.

A tornado watch will eventually be needed for this region by late
this afternoon to early evening for the storms moving out of
northern Louisiana and eastern Arkansas. However, if the storms
across central/eastern Mississippi continue to deepen/mature, a
tornado watch may be needed sooner.

Mesoscale Discussion 0414
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0234 PM CDT Sat Apr 05 2025

Areas affected...western Tennessee to far southern Kentucky

Concerning...Tornado Watch 122...124...

Valid 051934Z - 052130Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 122, 124 continues.

SUMMARY...A damaging wind and tornado threat is expected to persist
through the afternoon.

DISCUSSION...A well-developed squall line continues across western
Tennessee. Measured wind gusts have been mostly in the 35 to 45 knot
range recently as the apex of the bow weakened somewhat as it moved
into an airmass featuring low 50s temperatures. The only exception
was a measured 51 kt gust at KHKA at 1917Z on the northern end of
the bow.  Some enhancement of this bow is possible over the next 1
to 2 hours as it interacts with a more unstable surface airmass
along the front across southern Tennessee with temperatures in the
low 80s and dewpoints in the mid 60s. In addition, some enhancement
of the low-level jet (between 1 and 2 km) has been sampled by the
KOHX VWP. This will further support maintenance of the MCS and its
associated wind threat, and will also aid in the low-level shear
favorable for some embedded tornado threat. Expect the apex of this
bow to continue to orient along the instability gradient, along and
slightly south of I-40 between Memphis and Nashville, TN.
