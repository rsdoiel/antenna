Mesoscale Discussion 0747
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1205 PM CDT Fri May 10 2024

Areas affected...the central and eastern Carolinas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 101705Z - 101930Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered severe storms are likely to develop after 18Z
over the central Carolinas, producing damaging hail and wind through
early evening as they eventually exit the Atlantic Coast.

DISCUSSION...Surface analysis shows a deepening trough extending
from southeast VA across central NC and into northern SC, with
temperatures heating into the upper 70s F. Dewpoints remain in the
60s F, but may gradually mix down a few degrees by peak heating.

Morning soundings show steep midlevel lapse rates in place, as well
as ample deep-layer shear with mid to high level flow of 50 to 100
kt. This combination is resulting in a favorable environment for
large hail, and perhaps a few fast-moving bowing structures with
damaging winds.

As of 17Z, visible imagery is already showing developing towering CU
over northern SC and into central NC. The presence of cirrus from
the MCS to the south may have slowed heating a bit, but clearing
should continue, aiding destabilization.

Scattered to numerous storms are expected to form over the next few
hours along the boundary, with both cells and congealing line
segments possible. Some of the more isolated hail storms may produce
large amounts of 1.00 to 1.75" hail, with cold, severe downdrafts
possible as well.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 231
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
150 PM EDT Fri May 10 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Southern and eastern North Carolina
  Northern and northeastern South Carolina
  Coastal Waters

* Effective this Friday afternoon and evening from 150 PM until
  900 PM EDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  Scattered large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Scattered thunderstorm development is expected along and
ahead of a weak cold front/surface trough, starting near the North
Carolina/South Carolina border and then spreading eastward and
southeastward through the evening.  The storm environment will favor
a mix of supercells and bowing segments capable of producing large
hail of 1-1.5 inches in diameter and damaging gusts of 60-70 mph.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 60
statute miles north and south of a line from 55 miles south of
Charlotte NC to 30 miles south southeast of Cape Hatteras NC. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU1).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
1.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
29030.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1230 PM CDT Fri May 10 2024

Valid 111200Z - 121200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS
OF SOUTHEASTERN NEW MEXICO AND WESTERN TEXAS...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated strong to severe thunderstorms may occur Saturday across
portions of the Trans-Pecos and Far West Texas.

...Synopsis...
Mid-level troughing initially over the Upper Great Lakes region is
forecast to shift eastward across the northeastern U.S. Saturday. 
Meanwhile, a low over the southwestern states is forecast to shift
eastward across the Four Corners region through the period.

At the surface, a front will continue progressing eastward across
the western Atlantic, while lingering westward across the Florida
Peninsula and Gulf of Mexico, and then west-northwestward across far
West Texas and into New Mexico.  A second/weak front is forecast to
shift southward out of Canada into the northern Plains/Montana late.

...Southeastern New Mexico into western Texas...
Daytime heating of a modestly moist (upper 50s to low 60s dewpoints)
boundary layer across western Texas and into southeastern New
Mexico, in the vicinity of a stalled surface front, will result in
afternoon destabilization across this area.  By late afternoon peak
mixed-layer CAPE values should range from 500 to 1500 J/kg.  This --
combined with ascent provided by the frontal zone, and southeasterly
upslope near higher terrain -- should allow a few storms to develop.
With low-level southeasterlies beneath moderate mid-level
westerlies, shear sufficient for rotating updrafts suggests that a
couple of supercells will be possible, which may linger into the
evening while moving eastward toward the Concho Valley region of
Texas.  Large hail and locally damaging wind gusts would be possible
with the stronger storms, before diminishing by late evening.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1224 PM CDT Fri May 10 2024

Valid 111200Z - 121200Z

Minor modifications were made to the Elevated area based on the
latest forecast guidance. Additionally, isolated dry thunderstorms
may develop over and near eastern portions of the Elevated area.
However, the probability of dry thunderstorms is low and confined to
a narrow corridor in south-central New Mexico, which precludes
introducing an Iso DryT area at this time. Otherwise, the previous
outlook remains on track.

..Nauslar.. 05/10/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0159 AM CDT Fri May 10 2024/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will eject into the Atlantic as a second
mid-level trough ejects into the Southern Plains tomorrow
(Saturday). Surface high pressure will become established over the
eastern U.S., promoting cool conditions while potentially
appreciable rainfall occurs over the southern High Plains. As such,
wildfire-spread concerns will be limited across most of the CONUS.
Guidance consensus does suggest that 15+ mph sustained westerly
surface winds will overspread 10-20 percent RH along the southern
Arizona and New Mexico border area during the afternoon, where
Elevated highlights have been introduced. Otherwise, locally dry or
breezy conditions may prevail over the northern Plains or Florida
Peninsula, where localized wildfire-spread potential may exist.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1126 AM CDT Fri May 10 2024

Valid 101630Z - 111200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS
AFTERNOON/EVENING FOR SOUTHERN NC/NORTHEAST SC...

...SUMMARY...
Damaging winds of 60-70 mph and large hail of 1-1.75 inches in
diameter will be possible this afternoon/evening across southern
North Carolina and northeast South Carolina.

...Carolinas this afternoon/evening...
A midlevel shortwave trough over the OH Valley will move
southeastward to the Carolinas by this evening with an accompanying
surface cold front.  Surface heating in the wake of debris
cloudiness with the weakening MCS to the south and boundary-layer
dewpoints in the 60s will contribute to a corridor of moderate
buoyancy (MLCAPE near 1500 J/kg) ahead of the front.  Thunderstorm
development is expected by early-mid afternoon along and ahead of
the cold front and a diffuse pre-frontal trough across northern
SC/southern NC, and storms will subsequently spread southeastward
through this evening.  The moderate buoyancy, steepening low-level
lapse rates, and largely straight hodographs with ~50 kt midlevel
flow will favor damaging winds of 60-70 mph and isolated large hail
of 1-1.75 inches in diameter as the main threats with a mix of
supercells and line segments.

...Northeast Gulf coast and FL through this evening...
The initial MCS with damaging winds has now weakened and moved off
the Atlantic coast, with a band of elevated convection persisting to
the west in a zone of warm advection atop the trailing cold pool. 
There will be a low-end hail threat with the elevated storms from
the FL Panhandle into north FL today, prior to the storms weakening
later this afternoon.  Additional storm development along the
outflow boundary across the FL peninsula is somewhat uncertain,
given the observed tendency for low-level flow to veer to
west-northwesterly across central FL which suggests only
weak/shallow ascent along the boundary.  Overall, any lingering
severe threat should remain marginal through the afternoon.

...Upper MS Valley...
A midlevel trough over northern MN will continue to dig
southeastward over the upper MS Valley through this evening. 
Despite limited low-level moisture, surface heating/steepening
low-level lapse rates and ascent preceding the midlevel trough will
support a band of low-topped convection from mid afternoon through
late evening.  The stronger storms will be capable of producing
isolated wind damage 

...Edwards Plateau in TX today...
Though an isolated/elevated storm could occur today well to the
north of the surface cold front, buoyancy appears fairly limited
where storm formation is more probable.  As such, severe storms
appear unlikely (and any storm splits off the high terrain in Mexico
are unlikely to remain severe after crossing the international
border).

..Nauslar.. 05/10/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0158 AM CDT Fri May 10 2024/

...Synopsis...
An upper low will meander over the Southwest as a mid-level trough
amplifies over the eastern U.S. today, with northwest flow aloft
prevailing everywhere east of the Mississippi River. As such,
relatively cool conditions will prevail over much of the CONUS, with
significant wildfire-spread potential expected to be limited over
most locations. One exception may be central and eastern portions of
the Florida Peninsula, where 10-15 mph sustained westerly surface
winds, amid 25-35 percent RH, may overspread dry fuels during the
afternoon, warranting Elevated highlights. 

A few other areas may also experience localized conditions favorable
for wildfire growth. First, dry and occasionally breezy conditions
may overlap modestly receptive fuels over parts of southeast Arizona
into far southwestern New Mexico, which may promote locally Elevated
fire concerns during the afternoon. Second, dry northerly surface
winds will overspread the northern Plains behind the cold front,
though any wildfire-spread that materializes should be localized
given marginally receptive fuels.

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Central and Eastern Alabama
  Central Georgia

* Effective this Thursday morning and afternoon from 950 AM until
  500 PM EDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A couple tornadoes possible
  Widespread damaging wind gusts to 70 mph likely
  Scattered large hail likely with isolated very large hail events
    to 2 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Bands of strong to severe storms will likely continue to
push east-southeast across the Watch area through the early to mid
afternoon.  A few supercells are possible ahead of the main
thunderstorm bands and will also pose a severe risk, including the
threat for tornadoes and large hail.  Damaging gusts will be the
primary hazard with the thunderstorm bands, but a tornado may also
accompany any embedded stronger circulations within the line.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 50 statute miles
north and south of a line from 30 miles south southwest of
Tuscaloosa AL to 15 miles east northeast of Vidalia GA. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU7).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 215...WW 216...

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 2 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 60 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean
storm motion vector 26035.

Mesoscale Discussion 0728
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0939 AM CDT Thu May 09 2024

Areas affected...central/eastern SC...central/south GA...southeast
AL

Concerning...Tornado Watch 216...217...

Valid 091439Z - 091615Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 216, 217 continues.

SUMMARY...Leading convective line across the Savannah Valley may
necessitate an additional downstream watch issuance into the coastal
plain of South Carolina and Georgia in the near-term. Greater severe
potential is expected to evolve from upstream clusters and lines
shifting east-southeast from eastern Alabama, with likely watch
issuance into south Georgia.

DISCUSSION...A leading line of storms across parts of the Savannah
Valley into the SC Midlands has struggled to intensify with measured
gusts holding below 30 mph. However, full boundary-layer heating is
underway downstream to the coast. This coupled with a favorable low
to deep-layer shear environment per CAE VWP data will support
probable intensification of this line as it approaches the coastal
plain through early afternoon. An increase in damaging wind
potential, as well as brief embedded tornadoes may occur.

More prominent severe potential should emanate out of initially
semi-discrete supercells across parts of south AL spreading east of
the Chattahoochee River into GA, as well as an organized linear
cluster moving southeast from east-central AL. It appears likely
that further upscale growth will occur into this afternoon, yielding
a broader linear cluster/QLCS pushing southeast across much of
central and south GA.

Valid 091300Z - 101200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM CENTRAL
TEXAS TO PARTS OF THE GEORGIA/SOUTH CAROLINA COAST...

CORRECTED FOR INCORRECT SLGT LABEL LOCATION

...SUMMARY...
Very large hail with multiple supercells appears probable across
parts of north and central Texas into the ArkLaTex vicinity this
afternoon and evening -- including parts of the Dallas/Ft. Worth
Metroplex.  A broader corridor of severe hail and damaging-wind
potential will extend from east Texas into the lower Mississippi
Valley and Southeast.

...Synopsis...
In mid/upper levels, an extraordinarily long, more than continent-
spanning, positively tilted trough was apparent in moisture-channel
imagery.  The trough extended from an Atlantic cyclone south-
southeast of Greenland, across Newfoundland/southern Labrador and
southern parts of QC/ON, the Upper Great Lakes, upper Mississippi
Valley, NE, the central Rockies, southern Great Basin, central CA,
and west-southwestward over the Pacific.  On the western segment of
the trough, a remnant cyclone near FSD/YKN will dissipate shortly,
while a closed vortex develops over UT and slowly retrogrades
through the period.  Meanwhile, weak shortwave troughs now over
parts of MO/IA/IL will move eastward across the Ohio Valley region,
in advance of a larger, amplifying shortwave trough now over Lake
Superior and northeastern MN.  A weak, but still potentially
influential southern stream shortwave will move east-northeastward
from southwest to central TX today.  Picking up some convective
vorticity and related amplification, this perturbation should
accelerate eastward and reach parts of AL by 12Z tomorrow.

At the surface, 11Z analysis showed a diffuse frontal-wave low over
central IL, with quasistationary to locally warm front eastward
across central/southern OH to northern WV.  A cold front extended
from the low across southern IL to eastern AR, becoming wavy/
quasistationary through a weak low south of ABI, then cold again
into the Big Bend region.  This front, overall, will sag southward
across TX through the period, but hang up for much of the day ahead
of the low and around the DFW/SEP region, and across the Edwards
Plateau.  The Ohio Valley low is expected to move eastward to near
the southwestern corner of PA by 00Z, then move/redevelop eastward
across VA to near the Delmarva Atlantic Coast by the end of the
period.

...North, central and east TX...
At least a few supercells are expected to erupt in a high-
instability environment this afternoon, along and southeast of the
front.  This activity will be capable of large hail -- some of it
potentially 3+ inches in diameter -- as well as locally severe gusts
and perhaps a tornado or two.  The threat area includes the DFW
Metroplex -- unfortunately, no stranger to swaths of destructive
hail -- and areas southward/eastward into the Hill Country, I-35/45
corridors and Piney Woods.

The airmass across the region begins the day quite moist, with
surface dewpoints commonly in the low/mid 70s just southeast of the
front, and mid/upper 70s over the Gulf Coastal Plain.  Steep
midlevel lapse rates, related to an EML, were sampled by 12Z RAOBs
at MAF and FWD.  This airmass aloft will remain over the region,
with some subtle/reinforcing large-scale ascent possible ahead of
the southern-stream perturbation.  Meanwhile, the boundary layer
should destabilize amidst strong diurnal heating, causing the cap to
weaken considerably through early/mid afternoon.  Development is
possible as soon as late morning to midday near the front, over the
Edwards Plateau, and midday to mid afternoon farther north near the
low.  By then, 3500-4500 J/kg MLCAPE should be common, locally near
5000 J/kg.  Low-level flow should remain weak, but with enough
easterly component southeast of the front to foster strong veering
with height and long (sometimes nearly straight) hodographs.  This
will support splitting storms, with both left- and right-moving
supercells offering the threat for significant (2+ inch) hail. 
Sustained storms could produce 3-4-inch hailstones, based on
historic analogs and a 2D hail model applied to forecast soundings.

With a deep troposphere and abundant inflow-layer moisture, deeply
precip-loaded downdrafts are possible, with some midlevel momentum
augmentation and related severe-gust potential.  The wind threat
could evolve upscale and start forward-propagating eastward into LA
wherever early cells can aggregate into clusters.  The supercell
tornado threat is conditional, mainly dependent on local storm-scale
processes such as mergers and boundary interactions.  QLCS tornadoes
are also possible with any MCS.

...Lower Mississippi Valley to southern Atlantic Coast...
Ongoing, organized areas of thunderstorms over the Southeast,
interacting with and focused astride baroclinic/instability
gradients from outflow boundaries, will continue to offer damaging
wind, a few tornadoes, and isolated severe hail through at least
midday as they move across parts of northern MS, AL, territory
eastward/southeastward toward the GA/SC coast, and perhaps northern
FL.  For near-term concerns, refer to tornado watches 215-216 and
related mesoscale discussions.

The related outflow/baroclinic gradient should serve as a focus for
forward propagation, and perhaps initiation, of thunderstorms this
afternoon into tonight.  Surface dewpoints commonly in the 70s F and
strong diurnal heating south and west of the outflow boundaries will
contribute to peak afternoon MLCAPE of 3500-4500 J/kg, only slowly
diminishing through the evening and overnight hours.  Given the very
richly moist and favorable unstable environment in place, beneath
parallel-oriented midlevel flow, one or two organized MCSs may
result.  A conditional derecho potential exists, depending on timing
and location of upscale organization within this corridor.  If a
complex moves out of east TX, or develops far enough west in MS/LA
and is sustained all the way across the remainder of the Gulf Coast
States tonight, either readily could qualify.

One factor that may limit overall wind potential is the gradual
nocturnal stabilizing of the boundary layer.  However, sufficient
cold-pool organization, rear-inflow-jet development and forced
ascent of the still-favorably moist air may produce enough of a
vertical circulation throughout an MCS to overcome the nocturnal
influence.  At this time, too many mesoscale uncertainties remain to
insert an unconditional 45%/MDT wind corridor, but that may need to
be done in a succeeding outlook if convective guidance comes into
better agreement and/or mesoscale trends warrant.  A few tornadoes
also may occur, especially near the outflow boundaries where
low-level vorticity/shear will be maximized.

...Mid/upper Ohio Valley to Tidewater...
Scattered to widely scattered thunderstorms are possible today
across parts of the Ohio Valley region, with damaging to isolated
severe gusts and marginally severe hail possible.  Activity should
occur in an environment characterized by steepening midlevel lapse
rates ahead of the ejecting MO/IA/IL perturbations, modest
convergence near and ahead of the surface low, adequate near-surface
moisture with dewpoints in the 50s to mid 60s, and modest diurnal
heating.  MLCAPE up to the 1000-1500 J/kg range is possible.  Though
upper flow will be strong, nearly unidirectional profiles and lack
of greater midlevel winds should keep effective-shear magnitudes in
the 30-40 kt range over much of the area.

Farther east/southeast, cool/stable air north of a damming/preceding
frontal zone across VA and the Delmarva should limit the northern
end of severe potential.  Destabilization and available moisture
will be substantially limited today in the nominal warm sector,
between the damming front and a great deal of MCS/outflow activity
to the south over the Carolinas/GA.  Therefore, while thunderstorms
are possible this afternoon near the max temperature hours, and deep
shear may be adequate for a few organized cells, severe potential
appears isolated and marginal at best.  As such, severe
probabilities over much of the region have been reduced.

Mesoscale Discussion 0695
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0956 AM CDT Wed May 08 2024

Areas affected...Eastern TN and western NC

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 203...

Valid 081456Z - 081630Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 203
continues.

SUMMARY...A pair of supercells will pose threats for large hail of
1-1.75 inches in diameter and damaging winds from 55-70 mph as they
likely persist east-southeast across the remainder of eastern
Tennessee and into western North Carolina.

DISCUSSION...A pair of long-lived supercells, the easternmost of
which appears to be the more intense of the two, are steadily
tracking east-southeast across eastern TN. The downstream air mass
continues to destabilize, with surface temperatures having warmed
through the 60s to low 70s over the Great Smoky and Blue Ridge
Mountains, and through the 70s to low 80s across the adjacent
Piedmont. This will support the eastern extension of the TN Valley
buoyancy plume which was characterized by MLCAPE of 2000-2500 J/kg
per the 12Z BNA sounding. While low-level shear will remain weak per
MRX VWP data, strong mid to upper-level westerlies will support
persistence of discrete supercells which may consolidate into a
cluster as they emerge east of the higher terrain in the early
afternoon.

SUMMARY...A supercell cluster in Missouri will likely persist
through the afternoon while spreading east-southeastward toward
southern Illinois, southeastern Missouri and western Kentucky, with
some potential for additional storm development this afternoon.  The
environment will become more favorable for surface-based storms
capable of producing tornadoes (a couple of which could be
strong/EF2+), severe wind swaths up to 80 mph, and very large hail
of 2-3 inches in diameter.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 45 statute miles
north and south of a line from 5 miles south of Vichy MO to 40 miles
east of Paducah KY. For a complete depiction of the watch see the
associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU4).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 202...WW 203...

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 3 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 70 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 550. Mean
storm motion vector 29030.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 202
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
650 AM CDT Wed May 8 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Extreme eastern Kansas
  Western and central Missouri

* Effective this Wednesday morning and afternoon from 650 AM
  until 200 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 3
    inches in diameter likely
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...Initially elevated thunderstorms erupting near the KS/MO
line will pose a threat for large to very large hail through midday
as individual cells move northeastward to eastward.  A portion of
this activity may organize into an eastward- to
southeastward-moving, upscale-growing cluster with increasing
damaging-wind potential.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 75
statute miles north and south of a line from 15 miles west southwest
of Olathe KS to Vichy MO. For a complete depiction of the watch see
the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU2).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
3 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 550. Mean storm motion vector
27030.

Mesoscale Discussion 0680
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0333 PM CDT Tue May 07 2024

Areas affected...southern Lower MI...eastern IN...western OH...far
northern KY

Concerning...Severe potential...Tornado Watch likely 

Valid 072033Z - 072200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...As supercells spread quickly east-northeast from southern
Lower MI and northwest IN, an additional tornado watch/watches will
be needed prior to 22Z. This may also include a combined/separate
watch farther south in eastern IN/western OH ahead of supercells
intensifying over the Wabash Valley.

DISCUSSION...As mentioned in MCD 0679, an increasingly favorable
setup for supercells, a couple of which may be long-tracked, is
underway across northwest IN to the Wabash Valley. The northern
storms may being to outpace the rapid boundary-layer
warming/moistening that is occurring across northeast IN and
northwest OH into southern Lower MI. Nevertheless, the intense
mid-level jet will likely foster sustained supercells even as they
become slightly elevated towards southeast Lower MI. With backed
low-level flow and ample low-level shear (per IWX VWP data), the
tornado threat will remain prominent with any supercells along and
south of the surface warm front. A couple strong tornadoes are
possible.

Mesoscale Discussion 0679
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0253 PM CDT Tue May 07 2024

Areas affected...eastern IL...IN...and southwest Lower MI

Concerning...Tornado Watch 195...

Valid 071953Z - 072100Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 195 continues.

SUMMARY...Additional supercells are expected to develop and
intensify from the Lake Michigan vicinity southward towards the
Wabash Valley. Large hail and severe wind gusts will be possible,
with the tornado threat increasing as supercells mature into
Indiana.

DISCUSSION...A pair of supercells have been sustained along the
IL/WI border and earlier across the south part of Chicagoland, both
of which should weaken as they progress across southern Lake
Michigan. Several additional updrafts are gradually maturing farther
south over eastern into southern IL and northwest IN. Richer
boundary-layer moisture and stronger low-level shear across the
Wabash Valley portion of the region, all render increasing concern
for one or two of these storms to become long-track supercells.
Within an environment characterized by STP around 3-4, potential
will exist for a strong tornado. A limiting factor though with
southern extent is the degree of mid-level warmth/dryness south of
the intense jet that is ejecting farther north across northern IL
into southern Lower MI. This also renders uncertainty with how far
south sustained supercell development will occur in the near-term
over the Lower OH Valley.

Mesoscale Discussion 0678
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0205 PM CDT Tue May 07 2024

Areas affected...parts of central Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 071905Z - 072130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated storms may develop by late afternoon, with a
conditional threat of very large hail. A small Slight Risk is also
being added to the 20Z convective outlook.

DISCUSSION...Surface analysis shows a stationary front from Dallas
southwestward toward Del Rio, with generally weak wind convergence.
Ample low-level moisture exists south and east of the boundary, with
70s F dewpoints and MLCAPE in excess of 3000 J/kg. Convective
inhibition continues to decrease due to heating, as temperature rise
into the upper 80s to near 90 F. 

Visible imagery shows increasing CU fields west of the I-35 corridor
from Austin to San Antonio, particularly along the west edge of a
thicker but eroding cloud deck. 

Over the next few hours, isolated severe storms may form over this
small region. Relatively long and straight hodographs along with the
deepening moist boundary layer and very strong instability will
conditionally support very large hail. Splitting cells may occur as
well, with left movers also producing hail.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 195
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
225 PM EDT Tue May 7 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Central and Northern Illinois
  Central and Northern Indiana
  Southwest Lower Michigan
  Southeast Wisconsin
  Lake Michigan

* Effective this Tuesday afternoon and evening from 225 PM until
  900 PM EDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A few tornadoes likely with a couple intense tornadoes possible
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2.5
    inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...Scattered thunderstorms are forecast to continue to
develop and intensify this afternoon into the early evening.  The
environment will continue to destabilize through the mid to late
afternoon across much of the Watch area.  The stronger storms will
likely become supercellular and pose a risk for large to very large
hail, severe gusts, and tornadoes.  A couple of the more intense
supercells may yield the potential for a strong tornado.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 100 statute miles
east and west of a line from 30 miles east northeast of Racine WI to
60 miles southwest of Bloomington IN. For a complete depiction of
the watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS
WOU5).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 2.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 60 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean
storm motion vector 24035.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0245 PM CDT Tue May 07 2024

Valid 072000Z - 081200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR
INDIANA...WESTERN AND CENTRAL OHIO...AND NORTHERN KENTUCKY...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS
SOUTH-CENTRAL TEXAS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are expected across the southern
Great Lakes and Ohio Valley through evening.  A few tornadoes (some
strong), large to very large hail, and severe/damaging winds all
appear possible.

...20z Update...

Most of the ongoing outlook remains on track and reasoning has not
changed from the previous forecast. See Tornado Watch 195 and any
forthcoming MCDs regarding short term severe potential across parts
of the Midwest. 

A small Slight risk (level 2 of 5) has been added over portions of
central TX. A few storms capable of large hail (2.5+ inches
diameter) appear possible through evening. Agitated cumulus in a
very moist/unstable environment amid modest low-level convergence
continue to deepen this afternoon. Forecast soundings depict a
favorable environment for isolated but possible significant hail.
While this risk is somewhat conditional/isolated, given the
possibility for 2.5+ inch hail an upgrade to 15% SIG hail
probabilities appears warranted. For more details, see MCD 678.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1136 AM CDT Tue May 07 2024/

...Southern Great Lakes/Ohio Valley and vicinity...
Considerable uncertainty remains for this forecast due largely in
part to an ongoing broken squall line moving east across KY/IN/Lake
Michigan and the related influences for airmass destabilization in
its wake.  However, clearing skies in the MCS' wake will result in a
seemingly sufficient period of heating during the afternoon. 
Water-vapor imagery shows the deep-layer cyclone centered over the
northern Great Plains.  A mid-level speed max rotating through the
base of the larger-scale trough will move from the mid MS Valley
late this morning into the southern Great Lakes by early evening. 
Rapid strengthening of southwesterly 500-mb flow is forecast over
northern IL into the northern half of IN through the mid-late
afternoon.  As an effective warm frontal zone becomes draped across
the southern Great Lakes/OH Valley regions, curved low-level
hodographs beneath a lengthening of the mid and upper part of the
hodograph will support a supercell risk.  It seems most probable
based on morning model guidance that storms will initially develop
across central/northern IL and move northeast into northern IN. 
Isolated to scattered storms are forecast to eventually develop this
afternoon across parts of the OH Valley in association with
warm/moist-air advection---although considerable uncertainty remains
regarding this scenario.  The stronger storms (i.e., supercells)
will be potentially capable of a large to very large hail threat, in
addition to several tornadoes (perhaps a few which may be strong).  

...Arklatex to north-central and south-central TX...
Not much change in the forecast thinking across the Mid South
southwestward into parts of TX.  Isolated severe thunderstorms are
possible during mid/late afternoon.  Damaging gusts and large hail
would be the main concerns.  The threat over the area is conditional
-- more due to weak lift than thermodynamic considerations.  Surface
dewpoints commonly in the 70s F will underlie a deep troposphere and
enough middle-level lapse rates for MLCAPE in the 3500-4500 J/kg
range.  Weak low-level winds will constrain hodograph size and
boundary- layer shear.  However, enough mid/upper flow remains to
support around 45-55 kt effective-shear magnitudes, yielding a
conditional supercell environment.  In the absence of meaningful
large-scale support, and with shallower overall lift near the
front/dryline, convective coverage over this region is more in
question and likely isolated.  Additional convection may form
overnight in a warm-advection plume near and southeast of the front,
across parts of the Mid-South to Arklatex regions.  Marginal hail
and isolated damaging gusts would be the main concerns.

...Southeast KS late tonight...
A strengthening LLJ and associated warm-air advection will be
focused over the northeast OK/southeast KS region late tonight. 
Forecast soundings show large MUCAPE amidst strong deep-layer shear.
Large hail may accompany a stronger storm or two that manages to
develop/become sustained during the 08-12z period.

PUBLIC SEVERE WEATHER OUTLOOK  
NWS STORM PREDICTION CENTER NORMAN OK
0824 AM CDT MON MAY 06 2024

...Outbreak of tornadoes and severe thunderstorms expected over
parts of the central and southern Plains this afternoon and
tonight...

* LOCATIONS...
  Much of Oklahoma
  Central and eastern Kansas

* HAZARDS...
  Numerous tornadoes, several intense and long track
  Widespread large hail, some baseball size
  Scattered damaging winds, some hurricane force

* SUMMARY...
  A regional outbreak of severe weather with multiple strong,
  long-tracked tornadoes, as well as very large hail and severe
  thunderstorm gusts, is expected over parts of the south-central
  Plains from this afternoon through evening.

Preparedness actions...

Review your severe weather safety procedures for the possibility
of dangerous weather today. Stay tuned to NOAA Weather Radio, 
weather.gov, or other media for watches and warnings. A tornado
watch means that conditions are favorable for tornadoes to form
during the next several hours. If a tornado warning is issued for
your area, move to a place of safety, ideally in a basement or
interior room on the lowest floor of a sturdy building.
