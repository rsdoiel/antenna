0105 PM CST Sun Jan 19 2025

Valid 201200Z - 211200Z

...EXTREMELY CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR THE SAN GABRIEL
MOUNTAINS WESTWARD TOWARD THE SANTA SUSANA MOUNTAINS AND SANTA
MONICA MOUNTAINS...INCLUDING THE MALIBU COAST...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR MUCH OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA...

The primary change with this update was an expansion of the
Extremely Critical highlights to the Malibu Coast. Here, the latest
high-resolution guidance is in relatively good agreement, depicting
30-40 mph northeasterly surface winds (with gusts upwards of 60-70
mph) amid single-digit to lower teens RH. These dangerous
fire-weather conditions will continue into Day 3/Tuesday morning. 

Farther south, the Critical area was also extended to the coast in
Orange County and northern San Diego County, where confidence in the
development of 20-30 mph northeasterly surface winds (with higher
gusts) has increased. For portions of inland Orange and San Diego
Counties, localized extremely critical conditions are expected --
especially over the wind-prone mountains, foothills, and valleys.

For additional details, see the previous discussion below.

..Weinman.. 01/19/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0142 AM CST Sun Jan 19 2025/

...Synopsis...
A positively tilted shortwave trough is forecast to move southward
out of the Pacific Northwest and into Southern California late
Sunday night into early Tuesday Morning. By Monday afternoon, strong
mid-level northerly flow will reach Southern California, with an
amplified mid-level ridge following behind the trough and moving
east out of the Eastern Pacific. These upper-level features, in
combination with strengthening surface high pressure over the
Intermountain West, will result in a tight surface pressure gradient
directed offshore. The pressure gradient magnitudes suggest strong
Santa Ana winds developing as a result, lasting from Monday night
through Tuesday morning. 

Recent high-resolution forecast guidance has increased the
confidence in strong surface pressure gradients and strong surface
winds enough to introduce an Extremely Critical area, extending from
the San Gabriel Mountains westward to the Santa Monica Mountains and
Santa Susana Mountains. Forecasts continue to show strong surface
pressure gradients from LAX->DAG anywhere from -8 mb to -11 mb,
resulting in sustained surface winds of 35-40 MPH (gusting 60-80
MPH). These dry and windy conditions, coupled with dry and receptive
fuels, will result Extremely Critical conditions supportive of rapid
wildfire onset and spread. 

Critical fire-weather highlights extend into San Diego county, where
recent model guidance continues to increase confidence in strong
offshore flow and dry conditions overnight Monday into Tuesday
morning.

Mesoscale Discussion 0038
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1200 PM CST Sun Jan 19 2025

Areas affected...Portions of Mid-Atlantic States

Concerning...Heavy snow 

Valid 191800Z - 192230Z

SUMMARY...Snowfall will continue to increase from southwest to
northeast across portions of West Virginia, Maryland, and
Pennsylvania this afternoon with rates exceeding 1" per hour.

DISCUSSION...An upper-level trough and associated speed max rotating
around a low near Hudson Bay are moving toward the East Coast this
afternoon.  In response at the surface, a low over North Carolina is
forecast to deepen and shift northeastward through the afternoon. 
To the north to northwest of the surface low, low-level
frontogenesis will promote upward vertical motion and precipitation
banding.  Given these favorable factors and cold vertical profiles,
snowfall rates of >=1" per hour are likely this afternoon with
higher rates possible in banded structures.

...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms are not forecast on Tuesday or Tuesday night.

...Synopsis...
Thunderstorm potential largely appears negligible across the CONUS
through Tuesday night. An exception could be along the Gulf Coast.
Shallow and highly elevated convection, predominately producing
sleet at the surface, should be ongoing at 12Z Tuesday along the
northwest Gulf Coast. Mid-level lapse rates will be progressively
weaker with eastern extent downstream, suggesting that lightning
production will likely be nonexistent along the north-central to
eastern Gulf Coast. Primary deep convective potential should be
confined from the west-central to southeast Gulf through the period.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1118 AM CST Sun Jan 19 2025

Valid 201200Z - 211200Z

...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms are not forecast on Monday or Monday night.

...Synopsis...
Thunderstorm potential is negligible across the CONUS on Monday
through Monday night. One exception could be from the Middle TX to
southwest LA Gulf Coast where weak elevated convection should
develop early morning Tuesday. This will occur with strengthening
warm-moist advection centered on 750-700 mb, downstream of a
positive-tilt mid/upper-level longwave trough. Some CAM/non-CAM 12Z
forecast soundings, most aggressively from the NAM, depict scant
elevated buoyancy developing amid a plume of initially steep
mid-level lapse rates. With thermodynamic profiles suggestive of a
predominant PTYPE of sleet at the surface, these potentially
mixed-phase elevated parcels could support a few lightning flashes.
While thunderstorm probabilities may be nonzero, they appear to be
less than 10 percent at this time.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE CENTRAL
FLORIDA PENINSULA...

...SUMMARY...
Strong thunderstorms may impact parts of central Florida this
morning into this afternoon, and pose at least some risk for a
tornado and locally damaging wind gusts.

...FL Peninsula...
Expansive upper troughing covers the entirety of the CONUS this
morning, with moderate southwesterly flow aloft throughout the base
of this trough extending from the Southeast/Gulf of Mexico across
the Mid-Atlantic States and FL. Surface analysis places a low over
central NC. A cold front extends southwestward from this low through
southeast GA and the FL Big Bend. Modest troughing precedes this
front across central FL, with broad low-level confluence in the
vicinity of this pre-frontal troughing contributing to showers and
thunderstorms. Modest buoyancy persists over the region, with
mesoanalysis estimating MLCAPE around 500 to 750 J/kg.

Showers and thunderstorms are expected to continue throughout the
day as the cold front and pre-frontal troughing both shift gradually
southward. The environment will remain strongly sheared (i.e.
effective bulk shear around 50-55 kt) throughout the afternoon,
supporting the potential for a few more organized storms capable of
damaging wind gusts and perhaps even a brief tornado or two. Wind
fields will weaken with southern extent, with deep-layer vertical
shear weakening as well. As such, the severe potential will likely
maximize this morning into the early afternoon across the central FL
Peninsula.
