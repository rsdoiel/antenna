Mesoscale Discussion 0765
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0139 PM CDT Sun May 11 2025

Areas affected...eastern Idaho into western Wyoming and southwest
Montana

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 111839Z - 112115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Storms should gradually increase in coverage and intensity
from eastern Idaho into southwest Montana, with both hail and gust
potential.

DISCUSSION...A line of convection continue to increase in intensity
over the upper Snake River Plain, with both strong heating and
low-level warm advection ahead of it. Continued steepening of
deep-layer lapse rates as the upper trough moves in the from the
west and more heating should support further strengthening of this
convection. Strong deep-layer shear will favor hail production with
these storms over eastern ID. A brief/weak tornado cannot be ruled
out with the stronger cells this afternoon, as low-level stretching
is maximized.

Farther north toward the Bitterroots, stronger cooling aloft is
occurring, and areas of heating persist ahead of this activity as
well. Long hodographs and cold midlevel temperatures will favor hail
with these storms through the day.

0221 PM CDT Sun May 11 2025

Areas affected...central Florida northward toward southeast Georgia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 111921Z - 112145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Storms are forecast to increase in coverage throughout the
afternoon from the central Florida Peninsula into northeast Florida
and southeast Georgia.

DISCUSSION...Storms are currently increasing east of Tampa to west
of Okeechobee where strong heating has led to strong instability.
The southerly flow regime should support a north/northeast movement
to this development, affecting the remainder of central into
northeastern Florida. Breaks in the clouds in those downstream areas
are developing, and this should further increase instability.
Although temperatures aloft are not as cool as previous days, MUCAPE
over 2000 J/kg and deep-layer shear of 35-40 kt will support
cellular storm mode with sporadic hail > 1.00" expected. Locally
strong to damaging gusts cannot be ruled out as well, especially
with any merging outflows.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 245
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
110 PM MDT Sun May 11 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Eastern Idaho
  Northern Utah
  Western Wyoming

* Effective this Sunday afternoon and evening from 110 PM until
  800 PM MDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 80
    mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm intensity and coverage is expected to
increase this afternoon across eastern ID, northern UT, and western
WY. Environmental conditions support the potential for strong to
severe storms capable of strong gusts. Isolated large hail is also
possible, particularly in areas of higher terrain.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 80
statute miles east and west of a line from 65 miles north northeast
of Idaho Falls ID to 40 miles southwest of Salt Lake City UT. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU5).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
1.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 70 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
23035.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0259 PM CDT Sun May 11 2025

Valid 112000Z - 121200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
NORTHERN ROCKIES/GREAT BASIN AND MONTANA HIGH PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe wind gusts are expected across the northern
Rockies/Great Basin and the Montana High Plains from mid-afternoon
into the evening. Isolated severe thunderstorms are also possible
across the Southeast today through tonight.

...20Z Update...
The only noteworthy change with this update was a southwestward
expansion of the Slight Risk area into northern UT, driven by
15-percent severe wind probabilities. Here, ample diurnal heating
has resulted in a deep/dry boundary layer supportive of scattered
severe wind gusts accompanying high-based storms. Reference Severe
Thunderstorm Watch #245 for more details. Farther east, isolated
severe storms capable of producing locally damaging winds and
marginally severe hail remain possible across the Southeast into
this evening. Reference MCDs #766/767 for details.

..Weinman.. 05/11/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1119 AM CDT Sun May 11 2025/

...Northern Rockies/High Plains and northeast Great Basin...
Strengthening southwesterly flow aloft is anticipated throughout the
day as the upper low off the Pacific Northwest coast progresses
eastward and a lead shortwave trough pivots through OR/northern CA
into the northern Rockies. Strong heating will help destabilize the
airmass downstream from the northern Rockies into the northern High
Plains. Large-scale ascent attendant to the approaching shortwave
trough, coupled with orographic lift, will help initiate storms 
across the high terrain during the afternoon within this
destabilized airmass. 

Environmental conditions suggest some supercells are possible with
this initial development, with damaging gusts and isolated hail as
the primary risk. A low-probability corridor of tornado potential
exists across southeast ID. The storms should encounter an
increasingly mixed environment with eastern/northeastern extent into
central MT, with strong gusts becoming the primary severe hazard as
storms trend towards more outflow-dominant linear structures.

...Southeast States...
Recent satellite imagery and surface observations continue to show
the vertically stacked low over the Lower MS Valley, with broad
swath of southwesterly flow extending south and east of this low
from the central Gulf into FL. Surface features have become
increasingly diffuse across the Southeast and FL over the past two
days given the persistence of this low and associated precipitation,
but recent surface analysis shows a weak and wavy stationary
boundary extending from the low over the ArkLaMiss southeastward to
the AL/FL Panhandle border before arcing back northeastward across
southern GA. 

Scattered thunderstorms are ongoing and the general expectation is
for scattered to numerous thunderstorms to persist across much of
the region throughout the day. Widespread cloudiness should limit
heating, but ample low-level moisture will still support modest
buoyancy. Shear will gradually increase as the low to mid-level flow
strengthens this afternoon and evening, which could lead to some
transient storm organization, but in general convection is expected
to be disorganized, outflow-dominated multicells. Even so, isolated
damaging gusts are possible. Some low-probability tornado potential
exists as well, particularly along the stationary boundary across
southern GA around 00Z.

Farther northwest across AL/MS and into eastern AR, the airmass is
forecast to destabilize this afternoon as heating occurs beneath
cool temperatures aloft. Even with the cooler temperature aloft,
overall buoyancy will be modest given the somewhat cool low to
mid-level thermodynamic profile. Even so, a nearly unidirectional
southeasterly wind profile with moderate deep-layer speed shear
could support brief updraft organization. As a result, a few cells
may briefly produce marginally severe hail and locally strong gusts,
and possibly some funnel/brief tornado potential, from late
afternoon through early/mid-evening.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0252 PM CDT Sun May 11 2025

Valid 121200Z - 131200Z

...Southwest...
An accelerating subtropical jet across the Desert Southwest atop a
deep, dry boundary layer will support breezy afternoon winds across
southeastern Arizona and southwestern New Mexico, where fuels remain
relatively dry amid ongoing severe/extreme drought. Expanded area of
elevated fire weather conditions to account for higher expected
winds across south-central Arizona for Monday.

...Northern Plains and Upper-Midwest...
A broad area of dry, southerly return flow amid fuels with ERC
values above the 97th percentile will support elevated fire weather
conditions across the Northern Plains and Upper-Midwest. Record
setting temperatures in the lower to upper 90s are again expected
across the region. Locally critical fire weather conditions are most
likely from a corridor of enhanced south winds from north-central
Nebraska to northwestern Minnesota. Model guidance is still somewhat
inconsistent with overlapping low relative humidity so continued
uncertainty precluded adding Critical highlights at this time.

..Williams.. 05/11/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0149 AM CDT Sun May 11 2025/

...Synopsis...
The partially blocked upper-air pattern over the US will begin to
breakdown early in the new week as a trough deepens over the western
US. Strong mid-level flow will gradually move into the Plains, as
upper ridging moves eastward. Strong lee troughing/cyclogensisis
will support gusty south/westerly winds over the High Plains.
Fire-weather conditions are expected across the Great Plains and
Southwest Monday afternoon and evening.

...Northern Plains and Midwest...
Strong southerly low-level flow will continue Monday as the upper
trough ejects eastward and the surface low deepens over MT and the
western Dakotas. Surface winds of 25-30 mph are again expected
across much of MT, the Dakotas and into parts of NE/MN/IA. However,
RH values should begin to increase as low-level moisture is advected
northward and mid-level cloud cover reduces solar heating. While
still relatively dry below 30%, RH values do not appear critical.
This will favor widespread elevated and pockets of locally critical
conditions Monday afternoon.

...Southwest...
As the troughing over the west gradually deepens, strong mid-level
flow will begin to move eastward over the southern Rockies and
Southwest. Westerly downslope flow is likely across parts of eastern
AZ and western NM Monday. With gusts of 15-20 mph and RH below 15%,
several hours of elevated fire-weather conditions are likely within
dry fuels that have supported recent fire activity.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0211 PM CDT Sun May 11 2025

Valid 131200Z - 141200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
The risk for severe thunderstorms currently appears low across the
U.S. Tuesday through Tuesday night.

...Ohio Valley into the Southeast...

The persistent mid/upper low over the Mid-South and attendant trough
extending into the Gulf will likely weaken as the system shift east
toward the Atlantic coast on Tuesday. While some modest vertical
shear will remain over portions of the region, overall wind field is
expected to be weaker. Nevertheless, a seasonally moist airmass will
modestly destabilize diurnally in pockets of heating. Isolated
strong storms producing locally gusty winds and perhaps small hail
are possible, though overall severe potential appears less compared
to previous days.

...Intermountain West into the Great Plains...

A deepening upper trough near the Pacific coast will shift east over
the West on Tuesday. A belt of enhanced southwesterly flow will
overspread the Rockies to the High Plains. Diurnal thunderstorms may
develop over the northern Great Basin and northern Rockies.
Instability and heating are expected to remain modest, limiting
severe potential across the higher terrain of the Intermountain
West. 

Further east into the Plains, lee troughing along the High Plains
will sharpen with the approach of the upper trough. The upper low
over the southeastern U.S. will limit northwest moisture return
across much of the Plains. Nevertheless, strong heating and steep
midlevel lapse rates will support weak to moderate destabilization.
However, capping will likely limit much in the way of thunderstorm
development. A surface cold front is forecast to move east/southeast
across the Dakotas during the evening and overnight. This may allow
for a storm or two to develop after peak heating. This activity
would likely be either elevated or high-based. If a storm develops,
hail would be possible. Uncertainty in storm development/coverage
precludes severe probabilities at this time.

Areas affected...Portions of southeast Georgia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 111849Z - 112045Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...A locally greater risk for damaging winds and perhaps a
tornado is evident in southeast Georgia near a local warm front
feature.

DISCUSSION...A small corridor in southeast Georgia has heated into
the low 80s F. A few weak discrete cells exist near the
Georgia/South Carolina state line. One cell has recently intensified
and shown signs of low-level rotation. The localized warm front
feature will promote at least marginal potential for a brief tornado
with southeasterly winds near the boundary. Nearby KCLX radar
accordingly shows modest 0-1 km SRH. Over the next hour or two this
environment will support a locally greater risk for damaging winds
and perhaps a tornado. The discrete cells will have the greatest
potential, but stronger updrafts within the linear segment farther
southwest could also acquire low-level rotation as well.

Mesoscale Discussion 0764
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0130 PM CDT Sun May 11 2025

Areas affected...Salt Lake Vicinity

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 111830Z - 112030Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Severe wind gusts will be possible this afternoon with
high-based showers and embedded thunderstorms.

DISCUSSION...With temperatures rising into the low/mid 80s F in the
vicinity of Salt Lake, high-based showers and isolated thunderstorms
have deepened over the last hour. A few of these storms have
produced 58-63 mph measured gusts in Tooele/Salt Lake Counties.
While low-level wind fields are not overly strong, the 9.2 C/km
700-500 mb lapse rate observed in this mornings 12Z SLC sounding,
coupled with steep low-level lapse rates and high surface dewpoint
depressions, will continue to support strong diabatically driven
downdrafts. Severe wind gusts will remain possible through the
afternoon in association with this weak, disorganized convection.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS
OF THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND THE SOUTHEAST...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong thunderstorms may impact parts of the Southeast on
Monday. The strongest activity may pose a risk for a couple of
tornadoes, locally strong surface gusts, and isolated hail.

...Southeast...

The mid/upper low over the lower MS Valley will pivot northeast
toward the TN Valley on Monday. A belt of enhanced
south/southwesterly flow aloft will overspread portions of the
Southeast. Vertically veering wind profiles, with 30-45 kt of flow
between 700-500 mb, will support effective shear magnitude greater
than 30 kt across much of the risk area. South/southeasterly
low-level flow will maintain a moist airmass. Meanwhile, cool
temperatures aloft will support modest midlevel lapse rates. Pockets
of stronger daytime heating with aid in modest destabilization, with
MLCAPE around 500-1000 J/kg forecast. Similar to the previous couple
of days, bands of cells/clusters are expected through the day. This
activity will pose an isolated risk for locally damaging gusts,
marginal hail, and a tornado or two.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1151 AM CDT Sun May 11 2025

Valid 111700Z - 121200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE CENTRAL/NORTHERN
PLAINS AND UPPER MIDWEST...

Efficient diurnal mixing of a very dry boundary layer under strong
south-southwesterly flow aloft and a strengthening lee low will
continue to support gusty south-southwest winds through today across
the Northern Plains and Upper-Midwest. The winds combined with dry
fuels under possible record setting heat will support widespread
Elevated to Critical fire weather conditions across the Region.
Recent observed soundings and surface observations across the region
continue to show minimal upstream boundary layer moisture moving
into the region supporting afternoon relative humidity below 20
percent as far north as the North Dakota/Minnesota U.S./Canada
border. Critical highlights were extended northward into
northeastern North Dakota and northwestern Minnesota.

..Williams.. 05/11/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0147 AM CDT Sun May 11 2025/

...Synopsis...
Mid-level ridging over the Rockies will begin to move eastward as a
trough and strong southwesterly flow aloft move over the West. A lee
low will aid strong southerly winds over much of the Great Plains
and Midwest, while a cutoff low meanders along the Gulf Coast. The
dry southerly winds ahead of returning surface moisture will support
dry and windy conditions over areas with little recent
precipitation. Several hours of critical fire-weather conditions are
likely over the Plains today and tonight.

...Plains and Upper Midwest...
East of the deepening lee trough/cyclone, strong southerly winds are
likely across much of the central/northern Plains and upper Midwest.
As flow aloft form the advancing upper trough overspreads the
region, diurnal mixing will support widespread winds of 20-30 mph.
Afternoon RH values will fall to 20-25%, supporting several hours of
dry and windy conditions. As area fuels have continued to dry with
little recent rainfall (ERCs in the 80th percentiles), critical
fire-weather conditions appear likely today into tonight.

Valid 111630Z - 121200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
NORTHERN ROCKIES AND MONTANA HIGH PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe wind gusts are expected across the northern Rockies
to Montana High Plains from mid-afternoon into the evening. Isolated
severe thunderstorms are also possible across the Southeast today
through tonight.

...Northern Rockies/High Plains and northeast Great Basin...
Strengthening southwesterly flow aloft is anticipated throughout the
day as the upper low off the Pacific Northwest coast progresses
eastward and a lead shortwave trough pivots through OR/northern CA
into the northern Rockies. Strong heating will help destabilize the
airmass downstream from the northern Rockies into the northern High
Plains. Large-scale ascent attendant to the approaching shortwave
trough, coupled with orographic lift, will help initiate storms 
across the high terrain during the afternoon within this
destabilized airmass. 

Environmental conditions suggest some supercells are possible with
this initial development, with damaging gusts and isolated hail as
the primary risk. A low-probability corridor of tornado potential
exists across southeast ID. The storms should encounter an
increasingly mixed environment with eastern/northeastern extent into
central MT, with strong gusts becoming the primary severe hazard as
storms trend towards more outflow-dominant linear structures.

...Southeast States...
Recent satellite imagery and surface observations continue to show
the vertically stacked low over the Lower MS Valley, with broad
swath of southwesterly flow extending south and east of this low
from the central Gulf into FL. Surface features have become
increasingly diffuse across the Southeast and FL over the past two
days given the persistence of this low and associated precipitation,
but recent surface analysis shows a weak and wavy stationary
boundary extending from the low over the ArkLaMiss southeastward to
the AL/FL Panhandle border before arcing back northeastward across
southern GA. 

Scattered thunderstorms are ongoing and the general expectation is
for scattered to numerous thunderstorms to persist across much of
the region throughout the day. Widespread cloudiness should limit
heating, but ample low-level moisture will still support modest
buoyancy. Shear will gradually increase as the low to mid-level flow
strengthens this afternoon and evening, which could lead to some
transient storm organization, but in general convection is expected
to be disorganized, outflow-dominated multicells. Even so, isolated
damaging gusts are possible. Some low-probability tornado potential
exists as well, particularly along the stationary boundary across
southern GA around 00Z.

Farther northwest across AL/MS and into eastern AR, the airmass is
forecast to destabilize this afternoon as heating occurs beneath
cool temperatures aloft. Even with the cooler temperature aloft,
overall buoyancy will be modest given the somewhat cool low to
mid-level thermodynamic profile. Even so, a nearly unidirectional
southeasterly wind profile with moderate deep-layer speed shear
could support brief updraft organization. As a result, a few cells
may briefly produce marginally severe hail and locally strong gusts,
and possibly some funnel/brief tornado potential, from late
afternoon through early/mid-evening.

Valid 141200Z - 191200Z

...DISCUSSION...
Latest medium-range output remains generally similar to prior runs
concerning the pattern evolution Wednesday into Thursday.  A
significant short wave trough emerging from the Intermountain West
is forecast to support modest cyclogenesis across the central and
northern Great Plains through the mid/upper Mississippi Valley
vicinity.  It appears that this probably will be accompanied by
increasing potential for strong to severe thunderstorm development,
with severe probabilities maximizing across parts of the Midwest
late Thursday into Thursday night, as the stronger large-scale
forcing for ascent becomes better coupled with substantive
boundary-layer moistening and destabilization.  Aided by steep
lower/mid-tropospheric lapse rates associated with elevated
mixed-layer air, and moderate to strong low-level and deep-layer
shear, it appears that the environment will become conducive to the
evolution of an upscale growing and organizing convective system. 
But initial convection may include supercells posing a risk for
large hail and a couple of tornadoes, before damaging wind gusts
become the predominate severe hazard.

Based on the subsequent pattern evolution, it appears that this
convection could persist into, or re-intensify, Friday across parts
of the mid/upper Ohio Valley, with additional upscale growing
convection evolving along a stalling trailing cold front near the
southern edge of the stronger westerlies.  Into next weekend,
renewed cyclogenesis appears possible along the trailing flank of
the front across the south central Great Plains, where additional
strong to severe thunderstorm development may focus along  a
developing warm front, and a developing dryline southward through
the plains, as the warm sector destabilizes with increasing Gulf
moisture return.

However, by late Thursday into Friday, and beyond, these
developments remain much more unclear, as spread among and within
the various medium-range models begins to increase.  Substantive
differences begin to develop concerning the progressiveness of the
lead trough, and a trailing short wave trough emerging from the
mid-latitude Pacific.  The uncertain impacts of potentially multiple
evolving large convective clusters on succeeding days adds to low
predictability.

Areas affected...Parts of the FL Panhandle into far southeast AL

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 101208Z - 101415Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...A localized tornado and wind-damage threat may spread
eastward this morning.

DISCUSSION...A persistent storm cluster with embedded supercells is
moving eastward this morning across the FL Panhandle, to the east of
a surface low near Mobile Bay. Occasional upticks in rotation have
been noted over the last hour as cells interact with a frontal zone
that is very gradually moving northward across the area. Some
additional northward progression of the front is possible through
the morning, aided by the onset of modest diurnal heating downstream
of ongoing convection. This would increase the area across the
peninsula where an organized severe threat could evolve over the
next 2-3 hours. A supercell currently south of Fort Walton Beach
could pose a threat if it moves onshore, and additional cell
development is possible within developing convection west of Panama
City. 

Near and south of the front, favorable low-level moisture and
veering wind profiles (with effective SRH increasing above 100
m2/s2) will continue to support localized tornado and wind-damage
potential with any sustained supercells.

SUMMARY...Strong to locally severe storms are possible this morning.

DISCUSSION...A long-lived MCS has moved inland across the FL Big
Bend region this morning. This system has generally been subsevere
thus far since moving inland and has shown signs of weakening, but
filtered downstream heating of a moist airmass will result in MLCAPE
approaching 1000 J/kg with time this morning. This could allow some
intensification as the remnant storm cluster approaches northeast
FL, with an attendant threat of locally damaging winds. Storms
developing ahead of this cluster could also approach severe limits
through the morning.

Valid 091300Z - 101200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE FL PENINSULA AND FAR SOUTHEAST VA/NORTHEAST NC...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms capable of producing large hail and severe wind gusts
are possible across parts of the Southeast, but especially areas
such as the northern Florida Peninsula and eastern North
Carolina/far southeast Virginia.

...Florida/coastal Southeast...
Weak height falls and strengthening southwesterly winds aloft will
occur later today into tonight preceding the upper trough along the
middle Gulf Coast and lower Mississippi River Valley, with an MCS
over the west-central/north-central Gulf also a factor. The
relatively greatest destabilization is expected today across the
northern/central Florida Peninsula and nearby Georgia, where
guidance is in generally good agreement that MLCAPE will peak in the
2000-3000 J/kg range this afternoon. As instability increases during
the day, thunderstorms are expected to develop with sea breeze
influences, with isolated large hail and damaging winds possible.
Elsewhere, influences from the aforementioned MCS over the Gulf
should limited severe potential farther west along the middle Gulf
Coast, although some measure of recovery and weak cyclogenesis could
occur later tonight toward far southeast Louisiana to Florida
Panhandle vicinity.

...Carolinas/southeast Virginia/southern Maryland...
The closed upper low will shift generally eastward over the
central/northern Appalachians and northern Mid-Atlantic region
today, with a cyclonically curved belt of strong westerlies in its
base and attendant mid-level cold pocket (-18C to -24C at 500 mb).
Some showers/possibly a thunderstorm will exit the region and move
into the Atlantic today, with modest air mass
recovery/destabilization in its wake preceding a surface
low/reinforcing front. While the magnitude of the severe risk is not
entirely clear, the main opportunity for later-day strong/locally
severe storm development would appear to be across far southeast
Virginia and far northeast North Carolina. Strong wind profiles
would support organized storms pending sufficient destabilization,
with potential for severe hail and damaging winds, at least on an
isolated basis, primarily from mid-afternoon through sunset or early
evening.

Areas affected...northern Florida...southeastern Georgia...far

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 081729Z - 081930Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Hail and damaging wind threat may increase through the
afternoon as thunderstorms develop along the sea breeze.

DISCUSSION...The air mass across southeastern Georgia and southern
South Carolina has warmed and destabilized through the morning and
early afternoon, with temperatures now in the 80s. Thunderstorms
have developed across southern South Carolina along a southward
moving remnant outflow boundary. 

Additional thunderstorm development is expected along the sea breeze
boundary through the afternoon. Deep layer shear will see some
increase to around 30-40 kts through the afternoon, with increasing
westerly flow aloft. A plume of steep lapse rates is in place across
this region, owing to cooling temperature aloft. Largely straight
hodographs and moderate to strong instability will support risk for
large hail and damaging wind with thunderstorm development. This
area will be monitored for possible watch issuance by mid to late
afternoon.

Mesoscale Discussion 0745
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0214 PM CDT Thu May 08 2025

Areas affected...south-central Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 081914Z - 082115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm coverage to increase into the
afternoon/evening with potential for damaging winds and large to
very large hail.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorm activity has been ongoing across the
border in Mexico as well as across portions of far western Texas
this afternoon. The activity in west Texas has been slowly advancing
south and eastward near the Rio Grande. Activity across Mexico has
slowly begun to spread eastward into Texas as well. It is likely
that storms will move out of Mexico across the Rio Grande Valley
into portions of south-central Texas and into the south Texas Brush
Country.

The air mass across this region is very moist and unstable, with
MLCAPE around 1000-2000 J/kg. Deep layer shear around 40-50 kts will
support maintenance of supercells, capable of large to very large
hail (2-2.5 in) and damaging wind through the evening. This area is
being monitored for possible watch issuance this afternoon.

Mesoscale Discussion 0744
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0203 PM CDT Thu May 08 2025

Areas affected...southern Kentucky...middle Tennessee...northeast
Mississippi and northwest Alabama

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 238...239...

Valid 081903Z - 082030Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 238, 239
continues.

SUMMARY...Supercell development/intensification underway. Large hail
and damaging wind gusts remain the primary threat.

DISCUSSION...Several supercells have developed across northern
Tennessee into central Kentucky. These storms have a history of 1 to
1.75 inch hail thus far. The environment downstream of these
supercells continues to destabilize which will maintain the threat
through the afternoon and evening.

Farther south, additional storms have started to develop from
southern Tennessee into northeast Mississippi. Temperatures are not
as cold aloft, but temperatures are warmer (upper 70s to low 80s)
which has sufficiently compensated to support 1500+ J/kg MLCAPE (per
SPC mesoanalysis). Given the stronger deep-layer shear across this
region (~40 knots) beneath the mid-level jet core, expect these
storms to become supercellular with a large hail and damaging wind
threat. These storms may have the greatest threat for isolated 2+
inch hail given the more favorable wind profile. 

Severe thunderstorm watch 238 was expanded into northeast
Mississippi and severe thunderstorm watch 239 was recently issued
across northern Alabama to address this threat farther south.

Mesoscale Discussion 0743

0137 PM CDT Thu May 08 2025

Areas affected...The western Carolinas and southern Virginia.

Concerning...Severe potential...Severe Thunderstorm Watch likely 

Valid 081837Z - 082000Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Storms developing over the mountains will eventually
become severe with a threat for large hail and damaging wind gusts.

DISCUSSION...Visible satellite shows some deeper convection
developing along/near the crest of the Appalachians. As low-level
moisture continues to advect north and the boundary layer heats up,
instability will increase. This should permit storms to strengthen
further and move off of the terrain. Effective shear around 40 knots
(per SPC mesoanalysis) and 1500 J/kg MLCAPE will support the
potential for organized storms, including supercells. Expect a more
discrete mode with a hail threat initially before storms likely
congeal into one or more clusters with an increasing damaging wind
threat late this afternoon and into the evening. 

A severe thunderstorm watch will likely be needed by mid-afternoon
to address this evolving threat.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 239
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
200 PM CDT Thu May 8 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Northern and Central Alabama
  Southern Middle Tennessee

* Effective this Thursday afternoon and evening from 200 PM until
  1000 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail likely with isolated very large hail events
    to 2 inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms should continue to develop eastward from
northeast Mississippi into parts of northern/central Alabama and
southern middle Tennessee this afternoon and evening. Supercells
will pose a threat for large hail up to 1-2 inches in diameter. Any
clusters that can form may also pose some risk for damaging winds up
to 60-70 mph.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 55
statute miles north and south of a line from 55 miles southwest of
Muscle Shoals AL to 55 miles north northeast of Gadsden AL. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU9).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 238...

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
27030.

Mesoscale Discussion 0741
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1132 AM CDT Thu May 08 2025

Areas affected...Portions of far Western and South-Central Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 081632Z - 081830Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Storms capable of large to very large hail and severe
winds possible through the afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorm activity ongoing near the Trans Pecos and
Davis Mountains is showing an uptick in intensity over the last 30
minutes. Additionally, cumulus development further south across the
Texas Big Bend is noted on visible satellite. Further thunderstorm
development is expected this afternoon as a weak shortwave shifts
eastward and the current activity shifts south and eastward through
time. 

The environment across this region is characterized by MLCAPE around
500-1000 J/kg, steep low to mid-level lapse rates, and deep layer
shear 45-50 kts. Further daytime heating and moist advection will
lead to increase in instability through the afternoon. This regime
will support a mix of supercells and multi-cell clusters capable of
large to very large hail (some 2-2.5 in) and severe wind. There is
some uncertainty on when the most robust convection will develop
beyond the ongoing thunderstorms. This will be monitored for watch
potential this afternoon.

Mesoscale Discussion 0740
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1110 AM CDT Thu May 08 2025

Areas affected...the Mid Mississippi Valley to the Southern
Appalachians

Concerning...Severe potential...Severe Thunderstorm Watch likely 

Valid 081610Z - 081745Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Widespread thunderstorm development is expected this
afternoon with a threat for large hail and damaging wind gusts.

DISCUSSION...Cold temperatures aloft, associated with an eastward
meandering upper low, will provide a focus for widespread
thunderstorm development this afternoon from the Mid Mississippi
Valley to the southern Appalachians. Beneath this cold air aloft,
surface dewpoints are mostly in the mid 60s. This moisture will be
sufficient for moderate instability this afternoon (~1500 J/kg
MLCAPE) as temperatures warm into the mid 70s. A belt of moderate
(40 to 45 knots) of mid-level flow exists south of this upper low
and was apparent on the 12Z RAOB from KBNA and KLZK. This will
provide a sufficiently sheared environment for organized storms
including the potential for some rotating updrafts. This cold air
aloft, yielding moderately steep mid-level lapse rates, and
potential for some supercells will support a threat for large hail,
some of which could be 2+ inches. A remnant EML and dry air aloft,
combined with steep low-level lapse rates will also support a
damaging wind threat. In addition, the expectation for many storms
within the already uncapped airmass should promote storm clustering
which will also increase the damaging wind threat within those
corridors which clustering/bowing segments occur.

The 12Z BNA RAOB showed a convective temperature of 73F which has
nearly been reached as of 16Z. As such, a few storms have already
developed over southeast Missouri and northwest Tennessee where
cooler temperatures aloft are likely supporting a lower convective
temperature. As the boundary layer warms and mid-level temperatures
continue to cool, expect additional strong storm development within
the next 1 to 2 hours. Multiple severe thunderstorm watches will be
needed to address the threat from this development.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0330 PM CDT Wed May 07 2025

Valid 091200Z - 151200Z

Fire weather concerns will remain low in the D3/Wednesday through
D6/Monday period. A broad upper-low will linger across the
southeastern US as heights rise with an upper-level ridge building
in the western US. The building upper-level high in the west will
bring warming and drying conditions, but generally light winds will
keep fire concerns low. 

Late in period D6/Monday into D7/Tuesday, a trough is progged to
develop across the western Pacific. Increased southwesterly flow
aloft will overspread the Great Basin region, bringing likely
overlap of wind/dry conditions ahead of potential for more
precipitation. Less precipitation is expected across portions of
Arizona. Fuels in both of these regions are generally below seasonal
averages for dryness, owing to recent scattered shower and
thunderstorm activity. Though some drying is forecast in ERC
modeling, it is unlikely fuels will be overly receptive for fire
spread, leading to low confidence in including any areas at this
time. Some overlap of windy/dry conditions may extend into portions
of western New Mexico as well. For now, model spread leads to low
confidence in including areas.

Mesoscale Discussion 0723
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0348 PM CDT Tue May 06 2025

Areas affected...Southeast Texas to much of Louisiana.

Concerning...Tornado Watch 234...

Valid 062048Z - 062215Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 234 continues.

SUMMARY...Continued threat for severe wind gusts, tornadoes, and
isolated hail.

DISCUSSION...A well-developed line of storms extends from
east-central Texas to northwest Louisiana. Sporadic wind damage and
at least one tornado has been reported thus far within the line. A
more favorable orientation of the line has occurred across northeast
Texas/northwest Louisiana where a bowing segment is apparent. In
addition, a tornado with a TDS was recently observed southwest of
the SHV radar where a leading supercell interacted with this line.
Limited surface base instability amid mid 60s dewpoints and
preceding rainfall should keep the tornado threat somewhat limited,
but enough surface based or near surface based instability is
present for some tornado threat near the apex of this bow,
particularly where any cell interactions occur. Expect the greatest
severe wind threat near this bowing segment of the line across
northern Louisiana this afternoon and into the early evening.
Farther south, isolated large hail and severe wind gusts are
possible, particularly with any embedded supercells within the line.

A conditional greater tornado threat exists with any supercells
which can develop along/south of the warm front in Louisiana where
STP values are around 2 to 3. STP values may increase this evening
as low-level shear strengthens. Convection strengthening across
southeast Texas could be the beginning of this potential threat. If
any of these supercells can remain discrete with sufficient
longevity to mature, they will pose a strong tornado threat this
afternoon/evening.

Mesoscale Discussion 0722
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0337 PM CDT Tue May 06 2025

Areas affected...portions of eastern Pennsylvania into northwestern
New Jersey and southern New York

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 233...

Valid 062037Z - 062200Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 233
continues.

SUMMARY...Additional instances of damaging gusts and perhaps hail
remain possible with the stronger storms. A tornado may still occur
with storms ahead of a pre-frontal boundary.

DISCUSSION...A primary arching band of strong thunderstorms persists
ahead of a pseudo-dryline pre-frontal boundary across far eastern
PA, with temperatures rising into the upper 70s F amid 10 degree F
dewpoint decreases as the boundary passes. These pre-frontal storms
have been the most organized so far, with multiple instances of
low-level rotation detected and an apparent tornado reported in the
past hour. The best chance for an additional tornado remains with
these storms, along the PA/NJ/NY borders, before the ongoing storms
move into a more stable airmass. Otherwise, strong wind gusts and
perhaps hail may develop with the stronger storms to the west of the
pre-frontal boundary.

Mesoscale Discussion 0721
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0227 PM CDT Tue May 06 2025

Areas affected...much of the Florida Peninsula

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 061927Z - 062200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...A sparse severe threat could develop this afternoon across
the FL Peninsula, where a stray damaging gust or instance of hail
are possible. However, the severe threat should be isolated at best,
precluding a WW issuance.

DISCUSSION...Strong surface heating has aided in thunderstorm
initiation across the FL Peninsula as temperatures have climbed over
90 F. Given at least upper 60s F dewpoints steep low-level lapse
rates, 2000-3000 J/kg MLCAPE are in place south of a remnant frontal
boundary per 19Z mesoanalysis. Synoptic forcing is weak and vertical
wind shear is quite poor, casting doubt on any appreciable severe
threat. However, if a robust thunderstorm manages to develop and
persist, the strong buoyancy in place may support an instance of
hail or strong wind gusts, especially over southern parts of the
Florida Peninsula. Given the very isolated nature of the severe
threat, a WW issuance is not expected.

  A few tornadoes likely with a couple intense tornadoes possible
  Scattered large hail likely with isolated very large hail events
    to 3 inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph likely

SUMMARY...Supercell thunderstorms are expected to develop near a
warm front across the region with other storms related to an
eastward-moving cluster of storms across central Texas early today.
Tornado potential is apparent, including the possibility of strong
tornadoes. Damaging winds and large hail are also expected.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 65 statute miles
north and south of a line from 65 miles north northwest of San
Antonio TX to 35 miles southeast of Huntsville TX. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU1).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 230
continues.

SUMMARY...An increase in the tornado threat is expected with time
this morning. Tornado Watch issuance is likely later this morning,
though timing is uncertain.

DISCUSSION...Some increase in convection has recently been noted
across parts of the TX Hill Country, in close proximity to a surface
warm front that is expected to lift northward through the morning
across parts of south-central into east-central TX. Favorable
deep-layer shear and low-level SRH (as noted on the KEWX VWP) will
result in supercell potential through the morning, especially as the
warm front moves northward and rich low-level moisture continues to
support moderate to locally strong buoyancy. 

Timing of additional supercell development and maturation within the
warm-advection regime remains somewhat uncertain, as does the
potential influence of an ongoing eastward-moving storm cluster near
San Angelo. However, as the threat for surface-based supercells
increases, a corresponding increase in the tornado threat is
expected with time this morning, in addition to potential for large
hail and locally damaging winds. A Tornado Watch will likely be
needed later this morning, though timing is uncertain.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 230
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
325 AM CDT Tue May 6 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  West-Central and North-Central Texas

* Effective this Tuesday morning from 325 AM until 1000 AM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail likely with isolated very large hail events
    to 2.5 inches in diameter possible
  Isolated damaging wind gusts to 65 mph possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...At least isolated severe storms are expected to expand
east-northeastward across parts of the Low Rolling Plains toward
North-central/central Texas. Large hail will be the primary hazard
overnight, with locally damaging winds also possible. Tornado
potential should increase into central Texas/I-35 vicinity later
this morning.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 70
statute miles north and south of a line from 60 miles north
northwest of San Angelo TX to 55 miles north of Austin TX. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU0).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 229...

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 55 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector

Mesoscale Discussion 0700
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0348 PM CDT Mon May 05 2025

Areas affected...portions of southeastern Texas

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 225...

Valid 052048Z - 052215Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 225
continues.

SUMMARY...The severe threat continues across Severe Thunderstorm
Watch 225. Large hail remains the main concern, but a tornado could
still occur if a supercell can become surface based.

DISCUSSION...Multiple supercell structures have developed across
southeast Texas, and have been progressing eastward on the immediate
cool side of a baroclinic zone. These supercells are likely still
elevated, and given adequate buoyancy above 700 mb (per RAP forecast
soundings), severe hail could still occur given elongated mid to
upper-level hodographs and corresponding 50+ kts of effective bulk
shear. Closer to the Gulf Coast, multiple thunderstorms continue to
intensify within a WAA regime. These storms are associated with a
relatively more unstable, surface-based airmass. Regional VADs on
the warm side of the baroclinic boundary show low-level hodographs
with modest size and curvature, with around 300 m2/s2 SRH present
(per 19Z mesoanalysis). It is unclear if these storms can organize
and intensify into mature surface-based supercells before reaching
the cool side of the baroclinic boundary. If they do though, a
tornado remains possible.

0311 PM CDT Mon May 05 2025

Areas affected...east-central and southeast FL

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 224...

Valid 052011Z - 052215Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 224
continues.

SUMMARY...Potential for isolated large hail and localized severe
gusts should persist through early to mid evening across southeast
and east-central Florida.

DISCUSSION...Several cells across southeast FL have somewhat
weakened after earlier producing large hail reported up to ping-pong
ball size. This activity may still produce marginal hail/wind as
storms oscillate in the near-term. Large-scale convective outflow
has surged south and west, potentially serving as a focus for storm
development in the interior peninsula into early evening. 

Farther north, the Melbourne VWP has consistently sampled around
40-45 kt 0-6 km shear. Although thunderstorm development has been
subdued to an extent, additional storms may yet form along the
Atlantic sea breeze to the quasi-stationary front. Ample buoyancy
will favor isolated large hail and localized severe gusts.

Areas affected...eastern NC and southeast VA

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 223...

Valid 051910Z - 052115Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 223
continues.

SUMMARY...A mixed severe hail/damaging wind threat should persist
across eastern North Carolina and advance/shift north-northeast
across southeast Virginia through early evening.

DISCUSSION...Numerous cells have been prevalent, especially across
central into eastern NC this afternoon. Here, a south-southwesterly
deep-layer wind profile, per area VWPs, along with transient
supercell structures has resulted in convection largely progressing
northeastward thus far. But activity should pivot to a greater
northerly component given the evolution of the upstream vort
max/attendant mid-level jetlet. Air mass appears to be modestly
unstable downstream across southeast VA with MLCAPE of 1000-1500
J/kg. This should help sustain a severe hail/damaging wind threat
through early evening. Despite numerous cells and hail reports, peak
severe magnitude has only reached 1 inch thus far.

Mesoscale Discussion 0684
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0338 PM CDT Sun May 04 2025

Areas affected...southeast NM and far west TX

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 222...

Valid 042038Z - 042215Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 222
continues.

SUMMARY...Supercells are expected to intensify across southeast New
Mexico into parts of far west Texas through early evening. Hail is
the primary hazard, likely reaching golf to tennis ball size.
Isolated severe gusts to 70 mph and a brief tornado are possible.

DISCUSSION...Overall forecast remains as advertised. Storm
intensification has been gradual, but largely focused near the
Sacramento Mountains in Otero and Lincoln counties, and separately
over Eddy and Chaves, spreading into Lea within NM. These cells and
others that should develop off the higher terrain of the northern
Trans-Pecos in TX will likely intensify during the next few hours. A
ribbon of surface dew points near 50 F have held along the Pecos
Valley, supporting a confined corridor of moderate buoyancy. With
onset of strengthening low-level flow around 22Z, supercell
coverage/intensity should peak into early evening. Thereafter, drier
low-level air over the TX South Plains and eastern Permian Basin
should result in increased ingest of MLCIN deeper into the evening.

Mesoscale Discussion 0677
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0547 AM CDT Sun May 04 2025

Areas affected...eastern North Carolina into far southeast Virginia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 041047Z - 041345Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated strong gusts, and perhaps a brief/weak tornado,
cannot be ruled out over eastern North Carolina and eventually into
far southeast Virginia.

DISCUSSION...A line of convection with wind shift continues to push
east, now completely out of SC and over eastern NC. Earlier, a 50 kt
gust was measured near North Myrtle Beach. 

In addition to the narrow north-south line of convection, other
storms have developed ahead of the line. These storms have shown
periodic weak mesocyclones. Other storms continue to show
near-severe inbound velocities mainly over the water, but this
activity may eventually move inland.

The air mass is marginally unstable, but sufficient for isolated
severe reports this morning. Low-level SRH with 0-1 km values of
100-150 m2/s2 will continue to favor rotation within the stronger
storms, though any tornado risk should remain low-end in nature.
