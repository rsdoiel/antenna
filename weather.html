Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0354 PM CST Tue Nov 05 2024

Valid 071200Z - 131200Z

An active mid-level flow regime is likely to continue over the CONUS
through the extended forecast period. Strong troughing over the
western US will gradually shift eastward this weekend, followed by
shortwave ridging. By early next week, the upper ridge will break
down, allowing stronger jet energy to move back over the West ahead
of a deepening Pacific trough. This active and progressive flow
pattern will continue through the end of the period, supporting the
potential for critical fire-weather over parts of California.

...Southern California...
On the backside of the strong trough, northerly flow will linger
over southern California D3/Thursday into early D4/Friday. Offshore
winds will remain fairly strong early in the period before weakening
rapidly into this weekend. As the winds gradually fade, very low
humidity should persist into the first part of the weekend. This may
keep some risk for localized fire-weather concerns through D6/Sunday
across parts of southern California.

Later in the weekend and into early next week,  onshore flow will
return, increasing RH as a progressive, low-latitude flow regime
persists. Fire-weather concerns will lessen temporarily before
potentially returning ahead of another deepening trough midweek next
week. Medium-range guidance shows the potential for a period of
offshore winds behind the large Pacific trough into week 2. Strong
winds and very low relative humidity could overlap with very dry and
dense fuels across much of southern California. Model guidance
varies enough on the magnitude and timing of the onset of offshore
winds that probabilities will be withheld for the time being.
However, significant fire-weather concerns are possible at the end
of the extended forecast period and through next week.

0157 PM CST Tue Nov 05 2024

Valid 052000Z - 061200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS IN PORTIONS OF
SOUTHERN WISCONSIN AND FROM THE LOWER OHIO VALLEY INTO THE LOWER
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY...

...SUMMARY...
Locally damaging winds and perhaps a tornado or two may occur across
a portion of the Lower and Mid Mississippi Valleys, and central to
southern Wisconsin.

...20Z Update...
With the primary mid-level forcing moving away from the ArkLaMiss,
storm coverage should generally remain more isolated through the
remainder of the afternoon. Furthermore, regional VAD profiles
suggest low-level shear have been decreasing with time. Given these
observational trends, tornado probabilities have been reduced in the
region.

The marginal risk across Wisconsin has been adjusted based on
surface observations. A line of shallow convection moving east
through western Wisconsin may produce isolated strong/damaging winds
as it moves into areas where at least muted heating has occurred.
KMKX VAD suggests strong enough flow in the lowest 1-2 km to support
this risk.

..Wendt.. 11/05/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1019 AM CST Tue Nov 05 2024/

...LA/MS...
A large upper trough is present today over the central US, with the
primary surface boundary extending from eastern AR southward into
central LA.  Scattered thunderstorms have been occurring along and
ahead of this boundary, including several storms exhibiting low and
mid level rotation.  Winds aloft are expected to weaken through the
day, but there is a continued chance of isolated tornadoes for a few
hours late this morning and early afternoon.  Therefore have added a
small SLGT risk area.  Please refer to MCD #2213 for further details
on this environment.

...AR/TN/KY/IN...
A narrow line of thunderstorms is noted along the boundary across
eastern AR.  Several morning CAM solutions suggest this line may
maintain some character through the afternoon and it tracks
northeastward across parts of the mid MS Valley.  Visible satellite
imagery shows breaks in the clouds across this region, providing
some heating and destabilization.  Also, low level wind fields will
remain rather strong ahead of the convection.  This may be
sufficient for locally gusty/damaging wind gusts this afternoon.

....WI...
A few low-topped showers and thunderstorms will likely form later
this afternoon near a deepening surface low over WI.  Widespread
clouds will limit destabilization, but there is some potential for
locally gusty/damaging winds during the peak-heating period.

0131 PM CST Tue Nov 05 2024

Valid 061200Z - 071200Z

...EXTREMELY CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTHERN LOS ANGELES AND
SOUTHERN VENTURA COUNTIES...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR MUCH OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA...

...Afternoon Update...
Confidence remains high that a strong offshore wind event will
develop across much of southern California beginning early Wednesday
and continuing into Thursday morning. Santa Ana winds with isolated
gusts to 60 mph are possible across Los Angeles and Ventura
counties. These strong winds will overlap with very low RH as low as
8-10% supporting extremely critical fire-weather conditions.

The latest CANSAC WRF also shows strong offshore winds developing
across portions of Orange and San Diego counties Wednesday afternoon
and continuing through early Thursday. While offshore gradients are
not as strong, gusts of 40-50 mph and RH of 10-15% will support
several hours of critical fire-weather conditions amidst dry fuels.
Have expanded the Critical area across all of coastal Orange/San
Diego counties and into portions of the western inland Valleys. See
the prior discussion for more information.

..Lyons.. 11/05/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0213 AM CST Tue Nov 05 2024/

...Synopsis...
A mid/upper-level ridge will amplify over the eastern Pacific and CA
coast, as a belt of strong midlevel northerly flow extends from the
Northwest to southern CA. This large-scale pattern will reinforce a
strong surface anticyclone over the Intermountain West, leading to a
robust offshore pressure gradient across southern CA. 

...Southern California...
The offshore pressure gradient will be peaking from the morning into
the afternoon/evening time frame, with most guidance depicting a
LAX-TPH pressure gradient less than -13 mb and LAX-DAG gradient less
than -6 mb -- both indicating a strong Santa Ana event across
southern CA. This pressure gradient, combined with the strong
deep-layer northerly flow directed toward the coast, will promote
30+ mph sustained northeasterly surface winds across the typical
wind-prone Santa Ana corridors. Over the wind-prone mountains and
valleys of southern Ventura and northern/northwestern Los Angeles
Counties, gusts of 60+ mph will combine with RH decreasing into the
lower teens/single digits for several hours -- leading to extremely
critical fire-weather conditions atop receptive fuels.

...Northern/Central California...
The tightening pressure gradient and strong deep-layer northerly
flow will yield another day of breezy/gusty northerly surface winds
amid low RH across the western Sacramento Valley into the Coastal
Range. Given modestly receptive fuels, elevated to locally critical
fire-weather conditions are expected.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS IN PARTS OF
CENTRAL/WEST-CENTRAL TEXAS...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms are possible, beginning Thursday
afternoon across central/west-central parts of Texas.

...TX...
A mid- to upper-level low will meander slowly east across the Desert
Southwest during the period.  In between a surface high centered
over the central High Plains and TC Rafael in the Gulf of Mexico,
easterly low-level flow in the western Gulf Basin and TX will favor
a gradual westward push of modified moisture return into
west-central TX.  A surface trough will likely serve as the western
delimiter of moisture/instability.  Models indicate at least weak to
moderate buoyancy developing by mid-late afternoon in the Concho
Valley.  Shear profiles will support storm organization, including
the possibility for supercells.  Have made a small westward
adjustment to low-severe probabilities over west-central TX based on
the latest model guidance.  Large hail appears to be the primary
threat, although a confined zone may exhibit a short-duration threat
for a tornado.  A hail/wind risk could linger well into the evening
and perhaps early overnight depending on storm-scale details
unknown/not resolvable at this time.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1059 AM CST Tue Nov 05 2024

Valid 051700Z - 061200Z

...17z Update...
Minimal changes have been made to the Elevated area over northern
CA. Slightly stronger winds and lower humidity may occur over the
higher peaks of the coastal ranges this afternoon and evening. Gusty
winds and lower humidity may also extend farther south down the
Central Valley. This could support elevated fire-weather conditions
for a few hours. The elevated area was shifted slightly south.

Across southern CA, offshore pressure gradients should increase
overnight Tue into early Wed. Below 15% humidity and winds greater
than 20 mph are possible over the Transverse and Peninsular Ranges
and sustained Elevated conditions potentially beginning prior to 12z
Wed. Thus, have added an Elevated area to better account for the
increasing fire-weather threat into early Wed morning. Otherwise,
see the previous outlook for more info.

..Lyons.. 11/05/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0208 AM CST Tue Nov 05 2024/

...Synopsis...
On the backside of a broad/amplified large-scale trough centered
overt the Rockies, a belt of strong deep-layer northerly flow will
overspread CA. At the same time, the surface pressure gradient will
tighten over northern/central CA -- along the southern periphery of
strengthening surface ridging over the Northwest. This will yield
15-20 mph sustained northerly surface winds (with higher gusts) over
portions of the western Sacramento Valley into the Coastal Range.
These strong/gusty winds, coupled with 15-20 percent afternoon RH,
will favor elevated to locally critical fire-weather conditions.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS A PORTION
OF THE SABINE TO LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEYS...AND CENTRAL TO SOUTHERN
WISCONSIN...

...SUMMARY...
A brief tornado or two and locally damaging winds may occur across a
portion of the Sabine to Lower Mississippi Valleys, and central to
southern Wisconsin.

...Synopsis...
Mid/upper-level longwave troughing has become well-established over
the western CONUS.  That will persist through this and more outlook
periods, as a series of synoptic to large shortwave troughs
traverses the associated cyclonic-flow field.  The leading such
perturbation -- now located from the central Plains south-
southwestward over the southern High Plains to far west TX -- will
eject northeastward and weaken.  By 00Z, the residual, strongly
positively tilted trough should extend from a vorticity max over
western WI, across central/southwestern MO to central TX.  The
perturbation will deamplify greatly overnight and accelerate to a
position near the western QC/ON border, Lake Huron and IN by 12Z. 
Meanwhile, an upstream shortwave trough -- evident in moisture-
channel imagery over ID -- will dig southeastward and strengthen
greatly through the period.  By 12Z, it should be oriented
northeast/southwest through a developing 500-mb low over the Four
Corners.

The 11Z surface analysis showed an elongated area of low pressure
from southern WI to northwestern MO, with cold front through central
OK and north-central/central TX.  The front was preceded by an
extensive  convective band and associated outflow boundary from
central IL to central AR, east TX, and deep south TX.  By 00Z, the
front should catch up (or nearly so) to what remains of the
convective boundary, with the combined baroclinic zone extending
from a consolidated low over northern WI across the Mid-South region
to the northwestern Gulf shelf waters off TX.  By 12Z, the front
should extend from Lower MI across western portions of KY/TN/MS to
southwestern LA and the northwestern Gulf.

...Sabine to Lower Mississippi Valleys...
The ongoing convective band, near the western edge of the "Marginal
Risk" area, should weaken overall through mid-morning.  However, an
isolated damaging gust or brief tornado cannot be ruled out in the
meantime with any associated or preceding cell that may take
advantage of lingering favorable deep shear and high theta-e, in a
northward-narrowing corridor.

After a relative lull of a few hours, widely scattered to scattered
thunderstorms are forecast along the boundary this afternoon into
early evening, with isolated damaging gusts and/or a tornado
possible.  Afternoon boundary-layer destabilization is anticipated
ahead of the convective boundary, from both fragmented/cloud-
modulated surface heating and low-level theta-e advection.  A
corridor of surface dewpoints in the upper 60s to low 70s F will
persist an expand slightly northward ahead of the boundary.  With no
antecedent EML and minimal MLCINH, this should offset modest
midlevel lapse rates enough to result in effectively uninhibited
buoyancy, supporting an increase in convective coverage and local
intensity this afternoon.  Peak MLCAPE should range from around
500-800 J/kg over a narrow corridor of the Mid-South,
widening/increasing to around 1000-1500 J/kg over southern LA.  By
contrast, lift along the boundary, and in the form of deep-layer
ascent preceding the weakening mid/upper trough, will be greater
over the Mid-South, until some nebulous point where too little
instability exists to support organized convection.  The outlook has
been elongated northward somewhat to cover the marginal-buoyancy
plume near the Mississippi River.

...WI...
Isolated to widely scattered, shallow thunderstorms are possible
this afternoon, in an arc near the front and the organizing surface
low.  A few cells may produce damaging gusts.  A brief tornado also
may occur, especially with any cells that can linger within a narrow
zone of overlap between favorably, isallobarically backed near-
surface winds and weak boundary-layer instability.  A low-confidence
and quite conditional scenario exists here, with abundant antecedent
clouds and precip likely to limit destabilization for most of the
day.  Forecast soundings suggest enough large-scale ascent aloft to
cool midlevels a degree or two C, though lapse rates still will be
meager.  Areas that can experience a couple hours of relatively
unimpeded heating may attain 250-500 J/kg MLCAPE.

Mesoscale Discussion 2202
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0837 AM CST Mon Nov 04 2024

Areas affected...central/eastern Oklahoma and north Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Tornado Watch likely 

Valid 041437Z - 041700Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...The severe/tornado threat is likely to increase by late
morning.

DISCUSSION...A very moist airmass is present from north Texas to
much of eastern Oklahoma with dewpoints in the upper 60s. This has
already yielded 1000 to 1500 J/kg MLCAPE with minimal surface
heating. Given the minimal inhibition (per SPC mesoanalysis and
regional 12Z RAOBs), expect widespread thunderstorm development by
late morning to early afternoon. Moderate instability and strong
shear will support supercells capable of all hazards. Parts of
central and south-central Oklahoma (near the I-35 corridor) have the
greatest uncertainty. Outflow from this mornings storms has advanced
east of I-35 with low 60s dewpoints and northerly/westerly flow.
However, strong, southerly flow is trying to stall this boundary and
lead to northward/westward airmass recovery within this corridor. 

A tornado watch will eventually be needed, but it is unclear whether
the threat will start to increase in the next 1 to 2 hours or closer
to mid-day when the primary ascent overspreads the region. Trends
will be monitored and a watch will be issued when an organized
severe threat appears imminent.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0741 PM CDT Sat Nov 02 2024

Valid 030100Z - 031200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM PARTS OF
SOUTHWEST TEXAS INTO CENTRAL OKLAHOMA...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong to severe storms will be possible through tonight,
primarily from the Permian Basin and South Plains into Oklahoma.

...Northwest TX into OK...
Scattered clusters of rain and storms persist this evening from
extreme southeast NM across the South Plains and into central OK.
The large-scale instability gradient currently extends south of the
aggregate outflow, roughly from Midland TX to Ardmore OK, with
1000-1500 J/kg MUCAPE to the south.  

Given the persistent southerly flow regime through tonight, a moist
and unstable air mass will likely spread north, with elevated
instability increasing over currently rain-cooled areas from
northwest TX into OK. 

In the near term, the greatest supercell threat will remain over the
Permian Basin, in closer proximity to the most unstable air, with
hail or brief tornado risk. With time, storms may tend to
consolidate just north of the instability gradient, with an
increasing low-level jet supporting locally damaging gusts. Ambient
SRH over 200 m2/s2 may also favor embedded circulations at times,
especially if the activity can consolidate into a squall line as
indicated by some models.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 698
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
230 PM CDT Sat Nov 2 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Southeast New Mexico
  West Texas

* Effective this Saturday afternoon and evening from 230 PM until
  900 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A couple tornadoes possible
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2.5
    inches in diameter possible
  Isolated damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...Isolated to scattered severe thunderstorms are forecast
this afternoon into the evening across the Permian Basin.  A few
supercells capable of large to very large hail (1 to 2.5 inches in
diameter) and severe gusts (60-70 mph) are expected.  As the
low-level winds strengthen late this afternoon into the early
evening, a risk for a couple of tornadoes may develop with the more
intense supercells to the south of and immediately near an outflow
boundary draped from west to east across the area.  Storms will
likely grow upscale into one or more small clusters later this
evening with severe wind and hail becoming the primary hazards.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 50 statute miles
north and south of a line from 10 miles southwest of Carlsbad NM to
40 miles northeast of Midland TX. For a complete depiction of the
watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU8).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 2.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 60 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean
storm motion vector 23025.
