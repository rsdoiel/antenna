Mesoscale Discussion 1551
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0334 PM CDT Sun Jul 07 2024

Areas affected...Texas Panhandle/South Plains into
southwestern/central Oklahoma

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 072034Z - 072230Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...A few storms are possible from the Texas South Plains into
central Oklahoma. Discrete storms would pose a risk for large hail,
though severe winds will likely be the predominant threat. Potential
for upscale growth into a cluster/linear segment is possible. Trends
are being monitored for a possible watch later this afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Weak warm advection over the cold pool from this
mornings convection has contributed to the development of elevated
storms in parts of western and central Oklahoma. The outflow itself
has modified and MLCAPE has risen to around 2000 J/kg. With
additional heating and the approach of the cold front, at least
isolated development is possible within the next few hours. Steep
mid-level lapse rates and 30-35 kts of effective shear will promote
supercells capable of large hail and severe winds.

Farther west, cumulus have been deepening in the Texas South Plains
within a weak surface trough. A few additional storms are possible
in this region as well as suggested by some of the latest CAM
guidance. Large temperature-dewpoint spreads here would likely mean
a quicker transition to a linear storm mode and a primary risk of
severe winds.

With storm coverage uncertain, trends will need to be monitored for
a possible watch later this afternoon.

Mesoscale Discussion 1550
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0312 PM CDT Sun Jul 07 2024

Areas affected...north-central into much of eastern Colorado

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 072012Z - 072245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Storms are likely to increase along the Front Range this
afternoon, with many producing hail and locally strong gusts as they
continue into the Plains through evening.

DISCUSSION...Visible imagery shows an expansive cumulus field over
much of eastern Colorado where surface winds remain out of the east
and northeast. Weak thunderstorms have developed into far
north-central CO with increasing northern surface winds with high
pressure to the north. Pressures continue to fall near the Colorado
Springs area.

While pockets of drier air do exist around the Denver area, in
general, a moist air mass exists, especially over southeast CO with
mid to upper 50s F dewpoints. Given cool midlevel temperatures,
additional heating will result in sufficient instability to
sustained scattered severe cells. Low-level/weak easterlies below
increasing mid to high level winds will result in favorable shear
profiles for large hail. By evening, storms are expected to
consolidate into an MCS pushing into southeast CO, with damaging
winds possible.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 512
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
520 PM CDT Sun Jul 7 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Southwest Oklahoma
  Northwest Texas

* Effective this Sunday afternoon from 520 PM until Midnight CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2
    inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms are developing along a boundary from west
Texas into central Oklahoma.  These storms will track southeastward
through the afternoon and evening, posing a risk of locally damaging
wind gusts and hail.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 40
statute miles north and south of a line from 50 miles east southeast
of Chickasha OK to 45 miles west southwest of Lubbock TX. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU2).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 511...

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
29025.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0459 PM CDT Sun Jul 07 2024

Valid 091200Z - 151200Z

...Northwest...
On Day 4/Wednesday, the northern periphery of a large-scale ridge
centered over the Great Basin will break down, as a belt of moderate
midlevel west-southwesterly flow overspreads the Northwest. This
will promote an increase in westerly surface winds along/east of the
Cascades (especially in the Columbia Basin) -- where hot/dry
conditions will remain in place. Elevated to locally critical
conditions are expected, though sustained critical conditions may
remain localized to the Cascade gaps (e.g., the Columbia Gorge) --
precluding 70-percent Critical probabilities at this time.

The strengthening midlevel flow along the northern periphery of the
ridge may continue to promote dry/breezy conditions across the
Northwest (including northern CA into southern ID) through the
remainder of the extended forecast period. However, confidence in
any more than locally critical conditions is too low to add
additional probabilities.

Additionally, thunderstorm potential may increase across parts of
the Northwest late in the extended forecast period (i.e., Days
7-8/Saturday-Sunday), as a midlevel moisture plume spreads northward
along the western portion of the eastward-shifting large-scale
ridge. Confidence in thunderstorm development is too low to add Dry
Thunderstorm probabilities right now, though this scenario will be
monitored closely. 

...Central/Southern CA...
An enhanced onshore pressure gradient will continue to support hot,
dry, and locally breezy conditions primarily across inland portions
of central and southern CA through the period. While this will favor
elevated to locally critical conditions, the threat appears too
localized for probabilities.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0258 PM CDT Sun Jul 07 2024

Valid 072000Z - 081200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
MIDDLE/UPPER TEXAS COAST/FAR SOUTHWEST LOUISIANA...SOUTHERN
PLAINS...AND EASTERN COLORADO/FAR NORTHEAST NEW MEXICO...

...SUMMARY...
A few tornadoes will be possible along the middle to upper Texas
Coast into southwest Louisiana as Tropical Cyclone Beryl approaches
the coast and makes landfall later tonight. Scattered severe
thunderstorms are also expected across eastern Colorado, northeast
New Mexico, and parts of the southern Plains.

...20Z Update...
The Marginal and Slight Risks have been expanded southwestward
across western portions of the TX South Plains, where cumulus is
increasing this afternoon, and somewhat favorable instability and
deep-layer shear are already in place. Uncertainty remains rather
high regarding the potential for redevelopment across parts of
Oklahoma later this afternoon into the evening, in the wake of
substantial antecedent convection and outflow. However, relatively
strong heating is underway across parts of southwest/south-central
OK, and a few strong to severe storms remain possible by early
evening. No changes have been made to the Oklahoma portion of the
Slight Risk. 

No changes have been made to the other Slight Risks. Scattered
strong to severe storms are still expected from the CO Front Range
into eastern CO/northeast NM. Also, for parts of the middle/upper TX
Coast into far southwest LA, the tornado threat is expected to
increase late tonight into early Monday morning, as Tropical Cyclone
Beryl approaches the coast. See the previous discussion below for
more details regarding these areas.

..Dean.. 07/07/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1155 AM CDT Sun Jul 07 2024/

...Middle to Upper Texas Coast...
Tropical Cyclone Beryl and its outer envelope of strong low-level
flow, will continue to approach the Texas coast through much of the
period before making landfall tonight. Reference NHC for the latest
forecast details. Coincident with the expected strengthening of
lower tropospheric flow, low-level shear (i.e., enlarging
hodographs) will increase across the middle to upper Texas Coast
into southwest Louisiana through tonight, with embedded supercells
within the convective bands and transient rotating updrafts
potentially posing an isolated risk for tornadoes, especially into
tonight.

...Eastern Colorado/Front Range and far northeast New Mexico...
Low stratus persists at midday across east-central/southeast
Colorado toward the Raton Mesa vicinity, but more aggressive
clearing is occurring across northern Colorado. A belt of cyclonic
flow aloft will continue to overspread the region with some cooling
aloft, while low-level moisture and upslope flow both increase
through late today. Storms should develop near the foothills/I-25
later this afternoon and evening, likely with a bit
later-than-typical time frame for strong/severe thunderstorm
development. Moderate instability and strong shear will support
supercells capable of large hail, with some stronger wind gusts also
a possibility. Potentially severe storms may continue especially
across southeast Colorado/northeast New Mexico much of the night.

...Southern Plains including Oklahoma and North Texas/Panhandle...
A semi-organized cluster of storms has evolved across
east-central/south-central Oklahoma and may persist eastward early
this afternoon with a localized severe risk. Trailing outflow and a
residual surface cold pool are considerable factors in its wake,
although modification is likely into the afternoon. Storms may
redevelop as this occurs, potentially including parts of the Texas
Panhandle/Texas south Plains into western/southern Oklahoma and the
Red River vicinity, with isolated severe storms possible later this
afternoon through early evening.

...Iowa/northern Missouri/western Illinois to northern Wisconsin...
Surface pattern will remain relatively weak and ill-defined, but at
least widely scattered thunderstorms are expected particularly
across northern Missouri into Iowa and western Wisconsin near a weak
surface wave/boundary. Even with some cirrus and some residual early
day showers, moderate destabilization should occur across the
region, with development and intensification of storm clusters this
afternoon in the presence of 20-30 kt effective shear. Isolated
instances of wind damage is the most probable hazard, but some hail
could also occur. Some strong storms could occur as far north as
Wisconsin and perhaps the western Upper Peninsula of Michigan, but
the overall potential for organized severe storms should remain
limited.

...Southern Appalachians...
Short-term guidance substantiates the likelihood of scattered
thunderstorm development this afternoon, with some potential for
storms to cluster by late afternoon across upstate parts of the
Carolinas and far northeast Georgia. Mid-level lapse rates will be
weak with relatively tall/skinny CAPE, but some localized damaging
downbursts may occur.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0235 PM CDT Sun Jul 07 2024

Valid 081200Z - 091200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast reasoning (see below) remains the same, and no
changes were made with this update. Locally elevated fire-weather
conditions are also possible along the western and southern portions
of the San Joaquin Valley (to include the Diablo Range southward
into the Antelope Valley) in CA. Here, continued hot/dry conditions
will briefly overlap diurnally enhanced, breezy/gusty surface winds
during the afternoon. However, any elevated conditions appear too
localized and/or brief for highlights at this time.

..Weinman.. 07/07/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0144 AM CDT Sun Jul 07 2024/

...Synopsis...
A highly amplified ridge will remain in place over the western CONUS
through the day on Monday, with modest northwesterly mid-level flow
over the Great Basin and southwestern CONUS. RH is expected to be in
the 5-15% range across much of this region during the afternoon with
fuels which are at least modestly receptive to fire spread. However,
due to the lack of a well-defined mid-level flow perturbation, any
surface winds necessary for Elevated or Critical fire conditions are
expected to be localized and/or transient. Therefore, no highlights
have been included on this outlook.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1233 PM CDT Sun Jul 07 2024

Valid 081200Z - 091200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR PARTS OF EAST
TX...WESTERN LA...SOUTHWEST AR...

...SUMMARY...
A few tornadoes are possible on Monday from east Texas into western
Louisiana and southwest Arkansas, in association with Tropical
Cyclone Beryl.

...Synopsis...
Tropical Cyclone Beryl is currently forecast to strengthen into a
hurricane Sunday evening, and make landfall somewhere along the
middle TX Coast early Monday morning, shortly before the start of
the D2/Monday forecast period. Beryl is forecast to take on more of
a north-northeasterly motion during the day on Monday across east
TX, as it begins to become absorbed within a larger-scale
mid/upper-level trough moving across parts of the Great Lakes, Upper
Midwest, and Great Plains. A weak cold front will accompany this
trough across parts of the mid/upper MS Valley and Midwest/Great
Lakes. Farther southwest, an outflow-reinforced cold front will move
through parts of the southern High Plains into southern NM and far
west TX. 

...LA/east TX into AR and southern MO/IL...
At least a few tornadoes will be possible from east TX into western
LA and southwest AR on Monday, in association with Tropical Cyclone
Beryl. Some expansion to the 5% tornado probabilities has been made
based on the latest guidance and NHC forecasts. A corridor of
greater tornado probabilities may eventually be needed, depending on
trends regarding the track, intensity, and size of Beryl.  

Increasing low/midlevel flow along the eastern flank of Beryl will
spread across an already very moist environment across parts of east
TX and western LA through the day, with tropical moisture eventually
spreading northward into parts of AR, southern MO, and the mid-MS
Valley by afternoon/evening. While heating will be limited closer to
the immediate track, some modest destabilization will be possible to
the east/northeast of the center through the day. Strengthening
low-level shear/SRH (with 0-1 km SRH increasing above 200 m2/s2)
will support potential for a few tornadoes with at least transient
supercells, especially within the northeast quadrant of Beryl during
the day into the early evening. Some tornado threat could spread as
far north as the Ozarks region Monday night as Beryl continues
northeastward. 

Additionally, well in advance of Beryl, a few strong storms could
develop from northern AR into southeast MO and southern IL during
the afternoon, within a moist and moderately buoyant environment.
Midlevel southwesterly flow will be sufficiently strong to support
modest storm organization, with a threat of locally damaging gusts. 

...Parts of Far West into southwest TX...
Widely scattered thunderstorms are expected to develop Monday
afternoon across parts of the TX Trans-Pecos vicinity. Relatively
moist low-level easterly flow will support both favorable low-level
moisture and somewhat elongated hodographs across the region.
Moderate buoyancy and sufficient deep-layer shear will support a few
stronger cells/clusters, including the potential for a supercell or
two with a threat of isolated hail and severe gusts.

...Parts of the upper Midwest/Great Lakes...
Isolated to widely scattered thunderstorms will be possible across a
broad region of the upper Midwest and Great Lakes, in association
with the mid/upper-level trough gradually moving eastward across the
region. Modest buoyancy and modest deep-layer shear could support a
few stronger storms, and severe probabilities may eventually be
needed if a corridor of somewhat more focused potential becomes
apparent.

0842 PM CDT Sat Jul 06 2024

Valid 070100Z - 071200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE CENTRAL PLAINS...

CORRECTED FOR FLIPPED THUNDER LINE

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe storms will continue this evening across parts of
the central Plains. A few marginally severe storms will be possible
further west into the southern and central High Plains, and
northward into the mid Missouri Valley.

...Central Plains/Southern and Central High Plains/Mid Missouri
Valley...
The latest water vapor imagery shows an upper-level low over the
eastern Dakotas, with a shortwave trough extending southward from
the low into the central Plains. At the surface, a cold front is
located from western Nebraska into southeastern South Dakota, along
which a marginal severe threat will continue this evening. Further
southeastward into the warm sector, a couple convective systems are
ongoing along and to the east of the shortwave trough. An organized
line segment is located in far southeast Nebraska, along the western
edge of a corridor of moderate instability, where the RAP is
analyzing MLCAPE in the 1000 to 1500 J/kg range. WSR-88D VWPs in
this area have southeasterly winds at the surface, with winds
gradually veering to westerly in the mid-levels. This wind profile
will continue to be favorable for linear organization, and a
wind-damage threat is expected to continue in the vicinity of far
southeast Nebraska and far northwest Missouri this evening. Hail
will also likely accompany the stronger cells embedded in this line.

Further to the southwest into west-central Kansas, a severe
convective cluster is also ongoing along and to the east of a
north-to-south corridor of moderate instability. Near this area, the
RAP is analyzing MLCAPE in the 1000 to 2000 J/kg range. This
convection is located just to the north of the Dodge City WSR-88D
VWP, which has 0-6 km shear near 40 knots. This shear environment
should be enough to continue a threat for supercells this evening.
Supercells will likely be capable of isolated large hail. A few
severe wind gusts will also be possible. The ongoing convective
systems in Kansas and Nebraska are expected to continue into the
late evening, but the severe threat should become more isolated with
time as instability gradually decreases across the central Plains.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 508
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1225 PM CDT Sat Jul 6 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Western and Northern Kansas
  Central and Southern Nebraska

* Effective this Saturday afternoon and evening from 1225 PM
  until 800 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph likely
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2.5
    inches in diameter possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Clusters of storms will continue to develop and intensify,
initially near/north of the Interstate 80 corridor in Nebraska early
this afternoon, but also across northwest Kansas. Storms should
become more scattered/widespread by late afternoon, especially
across south-central Nebraska, where large hail and damaging wind
potential may be most focused.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 90
statute miles north and south of a line from 65 miles south of
Imperial NE to 35 miles east of Grand Island NE. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU8).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 550. Mean storm motion vector
29030.
