Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0704 AM CST Thu Nov 30 2023

Valid 301300Z - 011200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS
SOUTHEAST TEXAS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are possible today especially over
southeast Texas. A few tornadoes will be possible, along with hail
and isolated damaging wind gusts. Farther north, hail along with a
few strong wind gusts will also be possible across parts of
East/North Texas and southern Oklahoma.

...Central/Eastern Texas and Louisiana...
A progressive southern-stream shortwave trough centered over
Arizona/New Mexico in the predawn hours will continue eastward
toward the southern High Plains, before ejecting more northeastward
toward the Ozarks/Lower Missouri Valley tonight, with surface
cyclogenesis in a similar southwest/northeast-oriented corridor
today.

As this occurs, an increasingly moisture-rich maritime warm sector
will spread inland along the middle/upper Texas coastal plain toward
east-central Texas, although source-region trajectories have been
somewhat deleteriously augmented, at least temporally, by overnight
convection that developed over the western Gulf of Mexico. 

As additional low-level moistening (65-70F surface dewpoints)
occurs, confluence/convergence should increase within the broadening
warm sector across southeast/east-central Texas. Curved/relatively
elongated hodographs will exist today, such as noted in the 12z
observed sounding from Corpus Christi, TX, where 0-1 km SRH was
around 180 m2/s2, although a flow weakness and a residual capping
layer were both noted around 700 mb. Regardless, hodographs will
further lengthen as 1-3 km AGL (850mb/750mb) southwesterly winds
strengthen this afternoon. 

This will support an increasing potential for supercells into
midday/afternoon across southeast/perhaps east-central Texas, with
associated potential for a few tornadoes aside from thunderstorm
wind damage and possibly some hail. The potential for severe storms
including a tornado risk should continue into the evening as a
convective cluster moves across southeast Texas into southwest
Louisiana.

...North Texas/Oklahoma...
Farther north, convection will tend to be elevated with a more
isolated severe risk in the form of hail and possibly locally
damaging winds. However, even with limited moisture, a few stronger
near-surface-based low-topped storms could materialize across
western north Texas/western Oklahoma in vicinity of the surface
low/triple point, where a very steep lapse rate environment will
exist.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0232 PM CST Wed Nov 29 2023

Valid 011200Z - 071200Z

Multiple mid-level troughs will traverse the central and eastern
CONUS, accompanied by surface lee troughs/cyclones through at least
Days 5-6/Sunday-Monday, before upper ridging builds into the western
and central U.S. by mid next week. Before the upper ridging sets in,
dry downslope flow is likely each day (Friday-Monday) across the
southern High Plains. Nonetheless, the marginally receptive fuels
and lack of agreement between medium-range guidance members
regarding overlapping Elevated-equivalent conditions precludes
Critical probabilities this outlook.

..Squitieri.. 11/29/2023

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0150 AM CST Wed Nov 29 2023/

...Synopsis...
A southern-stream midlevel trough accompanied by strong deep-layer
westerly flow will cross the southern Rockies, while an attendant
surface low tracks east-northeastward from NM across north TX. On
the southern periphery of the surface low, a tight pressure gradient
and boundary-layer mixing into the strong westerlies aloft will
yield 20+ mph sustained westerly surface winds (with higher gusts)
over portions of southeastern NM, the TX Trans-Pecos, and TX South
Plains. These winds, coupled with 25-30 percent RH, could support
locally elevated fire-weather conditions. However, the marginal RH
reductions (stunted by upper 20s/lower 30s surface dewpoints) and
limited fuels should mitigate the overall fire-weather threat.

Farther east over parts of the Ohio Valley and Great Lakes,
breezy/gusty southwesterly surface winds are expected along the
western periphery of an expansive surface high centered off the
Carolinas coast. Limited RH reductions should generally temper
fire-weather potential here, though receptive fuels may still favor
spotty elevated conditions.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1106 AM CST Wed Nov 29 2023

Valid 301200Z - 011200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS
SOUTHEAST TEXAS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered storms, some severe, will be possible during the day on
Thursday, mainly over southeast Texas. A conditional risk for a few
tornadoes will be possible during the day. Otherwise, marginal hail
will be possible extending northward into parts of Oklahoma.

...Discussion...

A rather conditional severe thunderstorm set up is expected on
Thursday, mainly during the morning and afternoon hours across
southeast Texas. A warm advection regime, resulting in widespread
cloudiness and ongoing showers/thunderstorms will be underway at the
beginning of the period as a shortwave trough tracks across the
central/southern Plains vicinity. Upper 60s F dewpoints will be
focused near the Middle and Upper Texas Coast with low to mid-60s F
dewpoints extending northward toward the Red River/ArkLaTex
vicinity. A surface low will develop and shift east/northeast across
OK/MO as a trailing cold front moves southeast across the southern
Plains after 00z.

Forecast vertical shear profiles are impressive with large, curved
low-level hodographs becoming elongated/straight near 3 km. Strong
low-level southerly flow, with around 40-50 kt at 850 mb, is
expected. Effective SRH values greater than 300 m2/s2 near and north
of a warm front across east TX are depicted in forecast guidance as
well. This shear space conditionally would support supercell
thunderstorms. 

However, low-level thermodynamics appear problematic. Surface
temperatures and dewpoints may struggle to reach higher than 68-69 F
(except perhaps near the immediate coast). Furthermore, cloudiness
and morning convection will limit heating, and forecast soundings
indicate low-level lapse rates remaining quite poor and nearly moist
adiabatic. HREF members also continue to depict stronger negative UH
tracks than positive UH tracks, which is an indication that storms
may struggle to be rooted near the surface, limiting access to
better low-level vertical shear. Additionally, forecast guidance
shows modest warming through the day in the 850-500 mb layer, while
stronger large-scale ascent remains focused north of the region.

An outlook downgrade was considered. However, if boundary-layer
moisture is greater than forecast, or any stronger heating can
occur, low-level thermodynamics would improve and allow convection
to access better low-level shear, resulting in an increased risk for
a few tornadoes. As such, will maintain the Enhanced (level 3 of 5)
risk with only minor changes/eastward adjustments compared to the
previous outlook based on latest guidance.

Further north across north TX into OK, steeper midlevel lapse rates
are forecast closer to the midlevel speed max. Convection will
remain elevated, but sufficient elevated instability within a
favorable shear environment will support isolated hail in the
stronger cells through early evening.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1030 AM CST Wed Nov 29 2023

Valid 291700Z - 301200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast (see below) remains on track. Dry conditions
will also be present across portions of the central and southern
Appalachians. Here, a severe to exceptional drought is in place,
with appreciable rainfall accumulations lacking in the past week.
The absence of a stronger sustained surface wind field will limit
robust wildfire spread (hence no highlights). However, localized
wildfire-spread concerns could materialize by afternoon peak heating
if RH can drop below 30 percent and overlap with any wind gusts.

..Squitieri.. 11/29/2023

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0149 AM CST Wed Nov 29 2023/

...Synopsis...
A southern-stream midlevel trough will track eastward across the
Desert Southwest. Preceding this feature, a low-amplitude impulse
embedded in southwesterly flow aloft will cross the central Rockies,
promoting lee troughing and breezy/gusty southerly return flow over
the central High Plains. Increasing mid/high-level clouds
accompanying the impulse may stunt diurnal heating to an extent,
though modest downslope flow should offset this and yield around
15-20 percent RH. While locally elevated fire-weather conditions are
possible here, a limited overlap of the breezy winds and low RH,
combined with marginal fuels, should limit the overall fire-weather
threat.
