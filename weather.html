Valid 151300Z - 161200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
SOUTHEAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are expected across the southern Plains this
afternoon and evening, accompanied by severe wind gusts, large hail,
and perhaps a couple of tornadoes. Scattered severe thunderstorms
are also possible this morning into the afternoon over parts of the
central/northern Florida Peninsula, as well as the Carolinas.

...Central/northern Florida Peninsula...
Thunderstorms will likely continue to focus along, and perhaps later
redevelop a bit north of, a modestly convergent effective baroclinic
zone that extends southwest-northeastward across the region. A warm
and moist (at least middle 70s F surface dewpoints) air mass resides
across  much of the Peninsula. On the southern periphery of
moderately strong cyclonically curved westerlies, related to a
Tennessee Valley-centered upper trough, a moderately unstable
environment and 40+ kt effective shear have been supportive of
several embedded supercells in the pre-dawn hours.

A further increase in convective coverage and intensity appears
likely through the morning as the boundary layer warms, with some
semi-discrete supercells expected. Damaging winds and large hail
will be possible aside from a tornado risk. For additional
short-term details, see Mesoscale Discussion 790. The overall severe
risk seems likely to diminish/focus offshore by late afternoon.

...Carolinas...
Ahead of the weak surface low, adequate boundary layer heating and
moistening should occur beneath 6.5-7 C/km mid-level lapse rates,
supporting a marginally unstable but uncapped airmass by afternoon.
The combination of surface heating, and some dynamic lifting induced
by the approaching mid-level trough, will support late morning/early
afternoon thunderstorm initiation. Stronger westerly flow aloft from
the mid-level trough will overspread the warm sector, contributing
to 30-40 kt of effective bulk shear. Surface temperatures warming
into the low 80s F amid mid 60s F dewpoints will boost MLCAPE to at
least 1500 J/kg. Given relatively elongated, straight hodographs,
splitting supercells and merging multicells should occur through the
afternoon, accompanied by a severe wind and hail risk.

...Southern Plains...
A weak triple point will become increasingly established near the
Oklahoma/Kansas border vicinity into this afternoon, with a
moist/moderate unstable air mass to the east of a surface
trough/dryline extending southwestward toward the Texas Panhandle
and Texas South Plains. The region may be further influenced by a
subtle northeastward-developing mid-level speed max later today. 

Multiple zones of sub-regional thunderstorm development and
intensification are expected during the mid/late afternoon. This
includes high-based thunderstorm development across west/northwest
Texas within a deeply mixed environment. Ample evaporative cooling
within the deep, well-mixed boundary layer will yield the
development of deep, strong cold pools with a tendency to merge
through evening. Other storms should develop this afternoon in
vicinity of the Raton Mesa in an evolving low-level upslope flow
regime, and near and east of the Oklahoma/Kansas border vicinity
triple point. Supercells are most probable (potential and duration
thereof) with any development near/east of this surface triple
point, and with the evolving post-frontal upslope flow regime from
far northeast New Mexico into the Oklahoma/northern Texas
Panhandles.

Large hail will be possible especially within the first few hours of
deep convective initiation, but severe-wind-producing clusters are
expected to rapidly propagate from the Texas/Oklahoma Panhandles
into northwestern Oklahoma and eventually far southern Kansas by
late afternoon/early evening, preceded by richer low-level moisture
and a strengthening low-level jet. 

Storms should gradually weaken overnight as they either become
undercut by cold pools, or they outpace the buoyancy axis by the
time they reach far eastern Kansas and northeast Oklahoma. 

...Southern High Plains...
Farther south, more isolated thunderstorms may initiate along a
diffuse dryline across west/southwest Texas toward the Rio Grande.
Given overall weak forcing, confidence in thunderstorm development
and sustenance is not overly high, but any storm that can form and
mature may become supercellular, accompanied by severe wind and
hail.

Mesoscale Discussion 0781
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0930 AM CDT Tue May 14 2024

Areas affected...Portions of the northern/central FL Peninsula

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 141430Z - 141630Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...A cluster of thunderstorms should approach the Tampa metro
and vicinity around 15-16Z (11 AM - Noon EDT), while posing a threat
for mainly damaging winds. New watch issuance is possible to address
this potential.

DISCUSSION...A loosely organized cluster of convection is ongoing
this morning over the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Recent forward motion
of this activity suggests it should approach the FL Gulf Coast by
15-16Z. The 12Z sounding from TBW shows relatively cool mid-level
temperatures for FL (-10 C at 500 mb), along with steepened lapse
rates associated with an EML above 700 mb. But, there is still a
residual cap noted between 800-700 mb, which may tend to limit
updraft intensity over land in the short term. Recent surface
observations and visible satellite imagery also show strong
thunderstorms have developed along trailing outflow from earlier
convection across the north-central FL Peninsula. As robust daytime
heating of a very moist low-level airmass continues along/south of
this boundary, lingering MLCIN should gradually erode. Around
2000-3000 J/kg of MLCAPE will conditionally support intense
updrafts, with sufficiently strong mid-level westerly flow and
related deep-layer shear also fostering organized convection.

Thunderstorm evolution through the afternoon remains somewhat
unclear, as recent IR satellite trends show warming cloud tops with
the eastern Gulf convection. There is still some chance that strong
to severe thunderstorms consolidate along the outflow boundary over
the next couple of hours, and continue spreading eastward across the
central FL Peninsula this afternoon. If this scenario materializes,
then scattered damaging winds around 50-70 mph would likely be the
main threat as low-level lapse rates continue to steepen. A brief
tornado or two may also occur, although low-level flow has had a
tendency to veer to southwesterly this morning per latest VWPs from
KTBW, which has reduced 0-1 km SRH. Marginally severe hail also
appears possible with the more robust updrafts. It remains unclear
whether a new watch will be needed, but observational trends will be
closely monitored.

Mesoscale Discussion 0764
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0900 AM CDT Mon May 13 2024

Areas affected...Portions of coastal MS/AL into the western FL
Panhandle

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 234...

Valid 131400Z - 131530Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 234
continues.

SUMMARY...A greater threat for severe/damaging winds should focus
along the Mississippi/Alabama Coast into the western Florida
Panhandle this morning.

DISCUSSION...A small bowing cluster is ongoing over southern/coastal
AL this morning. A warm front is draped east-southeastward across
southern AL into the western FL Panhandle based on latest surface
observations. Recent velocity data from KMOB show strong inbound
velocities at low levels. A greater threat for severe/damaging winds
should be focused along and south of the warm front into parts of
the western FL Panhandle, where there will be a better likelihood
for downdraft winds to reach the surface. Enhanced low-level flow
and strong boundary-layer shear noted on recent VWPs from KMOB may
also support some threat for an embedded tornado.

Mesoscale Discussion 0763
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0833 AM CDT Mon May 13 2024

Areas affected...Portions of south-central TX

Concerning...Severe potential...Severe Thunderstorm Watch likely 

Valid 131333Z - 131530Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...The threat for very large hail and damaging winds should
continue to increase this morning. Watch issuance is likely.

DISCUSSION...The 12Z sounding from DRT shows rich low-level moisture
beneath steep mid-level lapse rates, with resulting MUCAPE
approaching 4000 J/kg. Strong deep-layer shear of 50-60 kt will
easily support supercell structures, and multiple thunderstorms have
already developed near Eagle Pass TX with a weak mid-level
perturbation ejecting from northern Mexico across TX. Current
expectations are for this ongoing activity to gradually spread
eastward across south-central TX this morning, while posing a threat
for very large hail (around 2-3 inches in diameter) with any
sustained supercells. Occasional severe/damaging downdraft winds may
also occur as low-level lapse rates gradually steepen with filtered
daytime heating. Severe Thunderstorm Watch issuance will likely be
needed to address the increasing threat for very large hail this
morning.
