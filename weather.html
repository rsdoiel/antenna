Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1229 PM CDT Mon Sep 09 2024

Valid 101200Z - 111200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR PARTS OF THE
LA GULF COAST...

...SUMMARY...
Some tornado threat associated with Tropical Cyclone Francine may
approach the Louisiana Gulf Coast by early Wednesday morning.

...Synopsis...
Tropical Storm Francine will potentially intensify into a hurricane
as it moves north-northeastward across the western Gulf of Mexico.
Meanwhile, a strong mid/upper-level shortwave trough is forecast to
dig southeastward into the Pacific Northwest and northern CA.
Diurnal thunderstorms capable of locally gusty winds will be
possible from the eastern Great Basin into parts of the Rockies, and
also across the FL Peninsula. More isolated storms will also be
possible from the central Plains into the parts of the upper
Midwest, which may also be capable of locally gusty winds. Organized
severe-thunderstorm potential is expected to remain low, with the
possible exception of the LA Gulf Coast region late in the period in
association with Francine. 

...LA Gulf Coast vicinity...
Refer to NHC forecasts and advisories for more information regarding
Tropical Storm Francine. Based on the current forecast track, the
most favorable environment for low-topped supercells associated with
Francine should remain offshore for most of the forecast period.
However, some outer bands may begin to approach the LA Gulf Coast
prior to 12Z Wednesday morning, accompanied by an increase in
low-level shear/SRH. A small Marginal Risk has been included near
the immediate LA Gulf Coast for the potential of an increasing
tornado threat prior to the end of the forecast period.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0150 AM CDT Mon Sep 09 2024/

...Synopsis...
Broad trouhging over the Northwest should continue today as an
embedded perturbation moves eastward over the northern Rockies.
Southwesterly flow aloft is forecast to increase over much of the
West as the broad trough slowly shifts east. At the surface, a cold
front will move into the Rockies, bringing a cooler air mass to
parts of the Northwest, but gusty winds to parts of the Cascades. A
lee trough developing east of the Rockies will help support isolated
dry thunderstorms over parts of WY and MT. Periods of stronger
surface winds and low RH will support elevated to near-critical
fire-weather conditions.
 
...Northwest and Great Basin....
Stronger flow aloft is expected to persist today over much of the
Northwest and northern Great Basin. Surface winds should increase to
15-25 mph as momentum from aloft mixes down. Downsloping and
mid-level drying should keep the air mass quite dry with diurnal RH
minimums below 15% likely. Several hours of widespread elevated to
near-critical fire-weather conditions are likely across the northern
Sierra and Great Basin.

Farther north, more moderate RH of 25-30% is expected beneath the
upper trough and behind the cold front. Despite the arrival of a
cooler Pacific air mass, downslope winds of 15-25 mph should overlap
with dry fuels and pockets of lower RH during the day. Overlapping
with recent lightning and fire activity, a few hours of elevated to
near-critical conditions are possible in the lee of the Cascades as
winds increase.

...Northern Rockies...
Stronger westerly flow head of the embedded shortwave will aid in
deepening a lee trough east of the Rockies. Westerly surface winds
should strengthen in turn, supporting pockets of downslope winds of
15-25 mph across parts of MT and WY. With hot temperatures and
little recent rainfall, afternoon RH values should remain quite low,
generally below 20%. Increasing winds, receptive fuels, and
persistent dry conditions should support several hours of elevated
to near critical fire-weather conditions over parts of the northern
Rockies.

...Dry Thunder...
Isolated, high-based thunderstorms appear likely over parts of the
Rockies (mainly WY and MT) today ahead of the shortwave trough. Weak
buoyancy, and PWATs of 0.5 to 0.7 inches, atop dry and well-mixed
low levels will support poor precipitation efficiency and the
potential for strong outflow winds. At least isolated storms are
expected over areas of receptive fuels. Thus, dry lightning
ignitions are possible, especially across parts of north-central WY,
where storm coverage appears greatest.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
NEW YORK...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated damaging winds may occur this afternoon across parts of New
York.

...New York...
Within large-scale upper troughing over the Northeast and eastern
Canada, an embedded shortwave trough over southern Ontario and the
upper Great Lakes will continue to move across the Northeast this
afternoon and evening. Ascent associated with this shortwave trough
and related mid-level jet is supporting isolated thunderstorms
across southern Ontario and vicinity. This activity will spread
east-southeastward this afternoon across parts of NY. The airmass
over this region should become only weakly unstable as filtered
daytime heating occurs, with poor mid-level lapse rates, persistent
cloud cover, and modest low-level moisture limiting destabilization.
Still, gradually increasing west-northwesterly winds at low/mid
levels will foster around 25-35 kt of deep-layer shear. This should
support modest thunderstorm organization, with multicells/small
clusters potentially evolving along and downstream of Lake Ontario.
Isolated strong to damaging winds should be the main threat with
this convection as it moves across much of NY this afternoon and
early evening, before eventually weakening with eastward extent with
the loss of daytime heating.

...Northern/Central Rockies and High Plains...
Isolated to widely scattered thunderstorms should develop this
afternoon over portions of the northern/central Rockies as a weak
shortwave trough continues eastward. Low-level moisture and related
instability are both expected to remain rather meager into the High
Plains, which should limit updraft intensities. Still, isolated
strong/gusty winds may occur with this high-based activity across
parts of MT/WY where low-level lapse rates can become steepened.
Greater low-level moisture is present farther east into the Dakotas,
along/east of a weak surface low/trough. But, increasing
low/mid-level temperatures and a strong cap should generally inhibit
thunderstorm development through much of the day with eastward
extent across the northern/central Plains.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS IN PARTS OF NEW
YORK...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated damaging thunderstorm gusts are possible in parts of New
York.

...Synopsis...
Mid/upper-level flow will become more zonal across most of the
northwestern and north-central CONUS, as a series of embedded
shortwave troughs penetrates/flattens antecedent ridging over the
Intermountain West and central/northern Rockies.  Downstream, a
substantial cyclone -- initially centered near the southwestern edge
of Labrador -- anchors mean troughing that extends southwestward
down the Appalachians.  The cyclone will eject northeastward over
Labrador through the period.  In its southwestern quadrant, a
shortwave trough was apparent in moisture-channel imagery over
northeastern ON, approaching Georgian Bay and the neck of ON.  This
feature should move southeastward to the upper St. Lawrence Valley,
eastern Lake Ontario and western NY by 00Z, then across southern New
England and offshore from the northern Mid-Atlantic Coast overnight.

The 11Z surface analysis showed a weak cold front from southern QC,
through a frontal-wave low over northern Lake Huron, then across
northern parts of WI/MN.  The low should move east-southeastward
toward Lake Ontario and weaken through the day, while the cold front
and associated veering wind shift cross the remainder of ON and
start moving into NY.  The front should cross the remainder of NY
and most of New England and PA overnight.  An older, quasistationary
front was drawn across north-central FL westward over north-central
Gulf shelf waters, then bending southwestward into the western parts
of the developing tropical cyclone in the western Gulf.  

Potential TC 6 -- now offshore from the Mexican Gulf Coast -- is
forecast by NHC to organize into a tropical storm this period. 
Given the forecast track, intensity and wind radii, any developing
favorable sector for supercells/tornadoes will remain well out in
the Gulf day-1, and not an overland tornado concern until day 3,
when a risk area has been introduced northeast/east of the forecast
center track.  See NHC advisories on this system for latest tropical
watches/warnings, and path/strength forecasts.

...NY...
Widely scattered to scattered thunderstorms are expected to move
southeastward to eastward across the outlook area from early
afternoon into early evening.  Isolated damaging gusts, and perhaps
a gust or two near severe limits, may occur from the most vigorous
embedded cells. 

This convection will be related to a compact (mesoscale) but strong
field of large-scale ascent preceding the shortwave trough, related
to its progressive field of DCVA, and forcing in the left-exit
region of a cyclonically curved speed max in the 250-500-mb layer. 
The UVV field likely is manifest already by convection now over
Georgian Bay and vicinity, moving toward what should become a more
unstable environment over the outlook area.  Deep-layer mean lapse
rates likely will never get steeper than about 6.5 C/km in this
setting.  Still, the combination of subtle cooling aloft, weak but
sufficient boundary-layer moisture, and some diurnal heating ahead
of the UVV field, should deepen the buoyant layer enough to yield
pockets of 500-700 J/kg MLCAPE.  Weak low-level shear, and 25-30 kt
effective-shear magnitudes in forecast soundings, indicate activity
should be multicellular.  A shallow but well-mixed subcloud layer --
containing around 7 C/km lapse rates -- will support strong
downdraft accelerations in some of the cores.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0210 AM CDT Sun Sep 08 2024

Valid 091200Z - 101200Z

...Synopsis...
A prominent shortwave, embedded within broader troughing over the
Pacific Northwest, is forecast to move quickly eastward over parts
of the Northern Rockies Monday. At the same time, ridging over the
West should continue to weaken as a belt of stronger southwesterly
flow aloft develops from the northern Great Basin and into the
northern Rockies. Increasing surface winds, and warm/dry conditions
will support the potential for elevated fire-weather conditions.

...Northwest and Great Basin...
As troughing settles over the West Coast, the mid-level flow will
continue to strengthen across the Sierras and northern Great Basin.
Surface winds of 15-25 mph appear likely as momentum from aloft
mixes down to the surface. Downsloping and continued warm
temperatures should keep the air mass quite dry with RH minimums of
15-20% likely. Several hours of widespread elevated to near-critical
fire-weather conditions are likely from northern CA/NV into parts of
southern ID and western WY.

A few hours of elevated to near-critical conditions are possible in
the lee of the Cascades as winds increase ahead of a cold front
moving onshore Monday. RH may be on the marginal side, particularly
with northward extent, as a cooler Pacific air mass move in.
However, downslope winds of 15-25 mph and recent active fire
behavior suggest some fire weather concerns will be possible.

...Northern Rockies...
As the shortwave trough approaches the Rockies, westerly flow aloft
should quickly increase. Downslope trajectories and intensifying lee
troughing will strengthen surface winds to 15-20 MPH across parts of
MT and WY. With hot temperatures and little recent rainfall
persisting, afternoon RH values should remain quite low, generally
below 20-25%. With increasing winds, receptive fuels, and persistent
dry conditions, periods of elevated fire-weather conditions are
likely over parts of the northern Rockies.

...Dry Thunder...
Across parts of the eastern Great Basin and central Rockies,
lingering monsoon moisture will likely support isolated to scattered
thunderstorms Monday afternoon. A mixed mode of wet and dry storms
is expected with PWATs of 0.7-1 inch, and increasing mid-level flow
supporting faster storm speeds. While there is some potential for
drier strikes, fuels across much of the area are less receptive and
storms should generally cluster with time. This suggests any dry
lightning potential will be limited.
