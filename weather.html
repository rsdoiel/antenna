Mesoscale Discussion 0851
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1237 PM CDT Mon May 20 2024

Areas affected...the Michigan Thumb vicinity

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 201737Z - 201930Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Strong to severe storms capable of isolated damaging wind
and hail are possible this afternoon.

DISCUSSION...A cluster of storms has recently intensified near the
Thumb region of Michigan. While low-level moisture is relatively
limited, strong heating is occurring downstream of this cluster,
supporting MUCAPE of near or above 1000 J/kg. Deep-layer shear is
rather modest, but unidirectional southwesterly flow may support
some organization with this cluster as it moves northeastward
through the afternoon. Steepening low-level lapse rates will support
a threat for strong/damaging outflow gusts, while stronger embedded
cells may be capable of producing some hail. In addition, isolated
strong storm development cannot be ruled out later this afternoon to
the southwest of the ongoing cluster, along a trailing surface
boundary.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1258 PM CDT Mon May 20 2024

Valid 211200Z - 221200Z

...THERE IS A MODERATE RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS SOUTHERN
IOWA...NORTHWEST ILLINOIS AND FAR NORTHEAST MISSOURI...

...SUMMARY...
Severe storms are expected Tuesday across the Midwest, especially
including portions of Iowa and Missouri into Wisconsin and
western/northern Illinois. Tornadoes (a few strong), damaging wind
gusts, and large hail are expected.

...Lower/Middle Missouri Valley to the Upper Great Lakes...
A notably strong belt of cyclonically curved westerlies (70+ kt 500
mb) will extend from the south-central Great Plains to the Upper
Midwest and Upper Great Lakes on Tuesday, with a lead/convectively
augmented shortwave trough likely to spread from the central High
Plains toward the Lake Superior vicinity late Tuesday night. An
elongated surface low over eastern Nebraska Tuesday morning will
deepen and lift northeast to northern Wisconsin/Upper Michigan by
evening, with a surface warm front lifting northward ahead of the
surface low, although its effective position will likely be
influenced by the early day precipitation. Meanwhile, a trailing
cold front will surge east across Iowa/eastern Kansas/northern
Missouri from mid-afternoon into the evening.

Remnant clusters of storms will likely be ongoing Tuesday morning
across central/eastern Nebraska, with the possibility of additional
storms farther east across southern Iowa/northern Missouri in
association with a warm-advection regime. Some key uncertainties
persist about the influences of this early day convection, but
trends will be for quick air mass recovery given a
progressive/highly dynamic pattern.

Very steep mid-level lapse rates will overspread the increasingly
moist warm sector, supporting aggressive diurnal destabilization
especially on the southern fringe of lingering convection/cloud
cover. Significantly strengthening mid-level winds and a diurnally
persistent strong low-level jet will support initial supercells
capable of large hail and a few tornadoes, including strong (EF2+)
tornado potential. But a mixed/transitional mode is expected
overall, as upscale growth occurs given the degree of forcing for
ascent, with likely evolution into a well-organized/fast-moving QLCS
capable of increasingly widespread/intense damaging winds and a
continued QLCS-related tornado risk. This scenario currently appears
to be most probable across southern/eastern Iowa into northwest
Illinois and nearby far northern Missouri. The severe risk will
persist into the Upper Great Lakes region and middle Mississippi
Valley overnight.

...Southern Plains...
Convective coverage will likely decrease with southward extent as
large-scale ascent focuses northward toward the Great Lakes.
Nevertheless isolated storms are possible into northeast
Oklahoma/northwest Arkansas by late afternoon/evening, and more
conditionally with southwest extent near a dryline from central
Oklahoma into central Texas. Large hail and severe gusts will be
possible with this activity.

...Northeast States...
A weak upper shortwave trough will move across southern Quebec and
northern New England. This will result in a band of enhanced
westerly deep-layer flow from northern New York into Maine. A
seasonally moist airmass will be in place with surface dewpoints
into the low 60s F, with strong heating and steepening low-level
lapse rates. MLCAPE to around 1000 J/kg and effective shear
magnitudes around 35 kt will support organized cells. Elongated
hodographs and favorable vertical shear suggest marginally severe
hail will be possible along with locally damaging wind gusts.

1138 AM CDT Mon May 20 2024

Valid 201700Z - 211200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF SOUTHERN/WESTERN NM
AND EASTERN AZ...

The forecast remains on track, and only minor adjustments/expansions
were made to the Critical highlights in AZ, based on the latest
observational data and high-resolution guidance. See the previous
discussion below for details.

..Weinman.. 05/20/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0202 AM CDT Mon May 20 2024/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level jet streak will overspread the Southwest this afternoon
as a mid-level trough amplifies across the western CONUS. A deeply
mixed boundary layer is expected across Arizona and New Mexico with
temperatures in the 90s. Some of this stronger flow will mix to the
surface amid the deep boundary layer. In addition, lee cyclogenesis
will tighten the pressure gradient in the region and aid in stronger
surface winds. Sustained surface winds of 25 to 30 mph are expected
across New Mexico with some sustained winds over 30 mph in northern
Arizona. Single-digit relative humidity is also expected across most
of the region. Fuels have started to dry to critical levels across
portions of eastern and northern Arizona. Therefore, a Critical
delineation is warranted.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1133 AM CDT Mon May 20 2024

Valid 201630Z - 211200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PORTIONS
OF THE CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
NORTHERN ILLINOIS AND SOUTHERN WISCONSIN...

...SUMMARY...
The primary threat for severe thunderstorms today will be over parts
of the central Plains, with large hail, damaging wind gusts, and a
few tornadoes possible.

...Central High Plains...
A large upper trough will slowly deepen across the western United
States today, with strengthening southwesterly mid/upper level flow
spreading across the Plains states.  A band of mid-level moisture
and instability will result in scattered high-based thunderstorms
across northern CO/southern WY by mid-afternoon, capable of locally
damaging wind gusts.  Other discrete supercell storms may form in
vicinity of the DCVZ as southeasterly low-level winds and elevated
terrain aid in initiation.  These storms will track
east-northeastward into a progressively more moist/unstable air
mass, with the risk of very large hail and a few tornadoes through
the evening.  By mid-evening, coverage of storms will increase over
southwest NE as a southerly low-level jet strengthens, with storms
progressing across the central Plains overnight with a continued
risk of large hail and damaging winds.

...IL/WI...
A well-defined remnant MCV from overnight convection over KS is
currently over northeast IA.  A surface boundary extends eastward
from the low across northern IL.  Broken clouds and partial
afternoon heating will aid in the development of thunderstorms near
the MCV later today as it tracks across southern WI/northern IL. 
Any storm that can interact with the boundary would have the
potential to become a supercell and pose a risk of a tornado or two.
 Otherwise, hail and gusty winds could occur with the strongest
cells.

...Southeast FL...
Widely scattered afternoon thunderstorms are possible across
southeast FL.  Ample low-level moisture, strong heating, cyclonic
midlevel flow, and relatively steep lapse rates could result in a
strong storm or two capable of gusty winds and hail.
