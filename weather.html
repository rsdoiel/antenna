Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0457 PM CDT Mon Aug 19 2024

Valid 211200Z - 271200Z

Omega blocking over the central CONUS is forecast to remain through
the majority of the extended forecast period. On the western flank
of the block, mid-level troughing will persist over parts of the
West Coast into next weekend. Enhanced flow aloft, with several
embedded shortwave troughs will support periodic dry and breezy
conditions over parts of the Northwest and Great Basin. Toward the
end of the week, a strong upper low will move south along the coast
supporting an increase in thunderstorm potential, along with
continued dry and breezy conditions over the Great Basin. Elevated
to potentially critical fire-weather conditions are possible.

...Northwest and Great Basin...
Moderate southwesterly flow aloft is forecast to remain in place
over the western US through much of the week. With stronger flow
aloft overspreading a warm and dry air mass across parts of the
southern Northwest and Great Basin, dry and windy conditions are
possible through midweek. Elevated to critical fire-weather
conditions are possible over parts of NV, UT and into southern OR/ID
through D5/Friday. Confidence in stronger sustained winds
overlapping critical RH and dry fuels is somewhat limited currently,
though the approach of the upper low/trough is expected to support
potentially higher gusts over much of the Southwest D4/Thursday and
into the weekend.

Increasing monsoon moisture is also expected over parts of the
Western US beginning D4/Thursday. Medium-range guidance shows a
plume of 0.6 to 0.8 inch PWATs moving into the Pacific Northwest
ahead of the upper low. Some dry lightning will be possible with
isolated to widely scattered storms through D6/Saturday. Confidence
is highest that dry thunder probabilities could be needed over parts
of northern and central OR through the end of the work week.
However, the exact storm coverage and overlap with the best fuels
remains uncertain.

Tropical Storm Gilma Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072024
200 PM PDT Mon Aug 19 2024

ASCAT data valid at 1644 UTC showed that Gilma has strengthened 
slightly and its wind field has grown a little. While the tropical 
storm is still sheared, maximum winds measured by the ASCAT were 
between 40 and 45 kt, which after accounting for undersampling 
supports an intensity around 50 kt. An average of the most recent 
Dvorak estimates from TAFB and SAB also yields 50 kt, so that is the 
intensity estimate for this advisory. The maximum extent of 34 kt 
winds is estimated to be around 70 n mi based on the ASCAT data, 
mostly to the southwest in the deep convection.

Although the track forecast spread in the model guidance remains 
unusually high, not much change was made to the NHC forecast, except 
to show a slightly faster forward motion in 24-48 h. Otherwise, 
Gilma is still expected to slow down and turn west-northwestward 
within the next day as the ridge currently steering the storm is 
gradually eroded by a deep-layer trough off the U.S. west coast. 
There is still quite a bit of difference between the models in the 
forward speed of Gilma, so the NHC forecast closely follows the 
consensus throughout the forecast. 

Only small adjustments were made to the intensity forecast. Gilma 
should remain sheared for another day or so, limiting the potential 
for strengthening during that period.  After that, the shear should 
decrease and Gilma should strengthen.  Most models continue to 
indicate that Gilma will approach hurricane strength later this 
week. The NHC intensity forecast remains very close to the various 
intensity consensus aids.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0257 PM CDT Mon Aug 19 2024

Valid 192000Z - 201200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS OF
THE NORTHERN AND CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS...AND OVER WESTERN MONTANA...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are possible across portions of the
northern and central High Plains, and over western Montana into
tonight. Large hail and severe gusts are the primary hazards.

...20Z Update...
Within the Slight Risk area over the central High Plains, 15-percent
wind probabilities were added over parts of eastern CO. Here, ample
diurnal heating/steepening low-level lapse rates has increased
confidence in a slightly greater concentration of severe wind gusts
-- especially with any clusters that evolve eastward into this
evening. For more details, reference MCD #1956 and Severe
Thunderstorm Watch #639. Farther north, the Slight Risk was expanded
slightly eastward into western ND, where filtered diurnal heating
and an eventual increase in the low-level jet should favor localized
upscale growth and a continued severe-wind risk into tonight. See
MCD #1958 for additional details.

From portions of the Northeast into the Mid-Atlantic, scattered
thunderstorms will continue tracking eastward along/ahead of a cold
front through the afternoon, posing a risk of locally damaging wind
gusts. The Marginal Risk was trimmed slightly behind the front in
the Northeast. For details, see MCDs #1955/1957.

..Weinman.. 08/19/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1117 AM CDT Mon Aug 19 2024/

...High Plains...
Moderately strong westerly mid-level winds are present today from MT
to CO, with several weak perturbations noted on water vapor imagery
within the flow.  Steep mid-level lapse rates and dewpoints in the
60s will lead to a narrow corridor of favorable CAPE later today for
strong/severe thunderstorm development.  Clusters of convection will
form over the mountains and foothills of CO/WY and spread eastward
into the higher instability axis.  Other areas of storms are
expected to develop over the Black Hills, and across parts of
eastern MT.  Large hail is the main concern with these storms,
although the risk of isolated damaging wind will also increase
during the late afternoon and evening as outflows congeal.

...Western MT...
12z model guidance continues to agree on the development of
scattered thunderstorms this afternoon over the mountains of western
MT.  This region will be on the eastern fringe of stronger flow
aloft, and where full sunshine will aid in destabilization and
steepening of low-level lapse rates.  As storms move off the higher
terrain, merging outflows may result in strong/damaging wind gusts
in the more organized storm clusters.  One mitigating factor for
severe in this region would be if the persistent cloud cover east of
the mountains limits destabilization.

...Southeast VA/Northeast NC...
Strong daytime heating is occurring today over parts of southeast VA
and northeast NC, where dewpoints in the upper 60s and 70s will
yield MLCAPE values around 2000 J/kg.  Scattered afternoon
thunderstorms are expected.  Low and mid-level winds are relatively
weak today, suggesting that storms will struggle to organize. 
However, given the extent of heating, a few cells may occasionally
pose a risk of gusty winds through the early evening.

...New England...
An upper trough is moving across the Northeast US today, with the
associated surface cold front tracking eastward across much of New
England this afternoon.  Scattered thunderstorms are expected along
the front.  Visible satellite imagery suggest considerable cloud
cover over this region, limiting daytime heating and suppressing
steeper low-level lapse rates.  This should lessen the overall
severe threat today.  Nevertheless, a few storms could produce gusty
winds and/or hail.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 639
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
145 PM MDT Mon Aug 19 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Eastern Colorado
  Nebraska Panhandle
  Southeast Wyoming

* Effective this Monday afternoon and evening from 145 PM until
  900 PM MDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2
    inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms are expected to build eastward off the
foothills of this afternoon, spreading across the watch area.  The
strongest storms will pose a risk of large hail and locally damaging
wind gusts.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 35
statute miles east and west of a line from 25 miles southeast of
Pueblo CO to 20 miles northwest of Chadron NE. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU9).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
24025.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0224 PM CDT Mon Aug 19 2024

Valid 211200Z - 221200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR THE
MONTANA/NORTH DAKOTA BORDER VICINITY...

...SUMMARY...
Widely scattered to potentially scattered storms will be possible on
Wednesday across parts of the northern High Plains. Severe winds and
large hail could occur. Marginally severe storms will be possible
westward into central Montana and southward into the central High
Plains.

...Synopsis...
Broad cyclonic flow will continue across portions of the Western
U.S. A mid-level shortwave trough is expected to lift northeastward
through the northern Rockies into the northern High Plains late
Wednesday afternoon into the evening. A surface low will deepen near
the Montana/North Dakota border with a lee trough extending into the
central High Plains.

...Montana into North Dakota...
Convection is likely to form within the higher terrain of southwest
Montana. Deep-layer shear will be strong, but buoyancy will be weak
to modest. Strong/severe wind gusts and isolated large hail are
possible. Greater uncertainty exists in the exact scenario for the
Montana/North Dakota border vicinity. With the surface low
deepening, a few storms could initiate during the
mid/late-afternoon. These storms would have a greater chance at
maintaining a supercellular mode. Severe wind gusts and large hail
would be the main hazards with this scenario. However, mid-level
heights will be mostly neutral through the day before modest falls
occur by early evening and low-level forcing will be limited as
well. A second possibility is for activity in Montana to move into
the border region during early/mid-evening. Severe winds would be
the primary hazard with what would likely be outflow-dominant
storms. Given the late timing of these storms, it is not certain how
much severe coverage there would be. The 15% severe probability area
will be maintained this cycle with guidance hopefully providing more
clarity in the coming days.

...Black Hills into central High Plains...
Isolated to widely scattered storms are possible within the lee
trough. Shear will be weaker with southern extent. A few severe
gusts and marginally severe hail could occur with the strongest
storms during the afternoon.

...Mid-Missouri Valley...
Some convection may be ongoing in eastern South Dakota into southern
Minnesota early in the period. Some outflow can be expected with
this activity. With the MCV, flow aloft will be enhanced into
eastern Nebraska. While a conditional threat for a strong/severe
storm exists, low/mid-level forcing will be weak and storm
initiation is far from certain.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0208 PM CDT Mon Aug 19 2024

Valid 201200Z - 211200Z

...20z Update...
Confidence has increased that a corridor of elevated to locally
critical fire-weather conditions are possible over parts of eastern
ID into southwestern MT D2/Tuesday. Stronger flow aloft ahead of a
weak upper trough embedded within southwesterly flow will support
deeper mixing and wind gusts to 15-20 mph as it passes overhead
through the afternoon. With RH below 20% and dry area fuels,
fire-weather concerns are expected to be elevated. Otherwise, the
previous forecast remains valid with minimal changes.

..Lyons.. 08/19/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0158 AM CDT Mon Aug 19 2024/

...Synopsis...
The West Coast mid-level trough will slowly progress eastward
tomorrow (Tuesday), with strong southwesterly 500 mb flow expected
to overspread the Great Basin. Similar to Day 1 (today), afternoon
boundary-layer mixing will promote dry and windy conditions along
the Oregon/California/Nevada border, as well as southwestern into
central Nevada, where Elevated highlights have been added.

Tropical Storm Gilma Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072024
800 AM PDT Mon Aug 19 2024

Recent AMSR and SSMIS imagery indicate that Gilma's center is 
located near the northeast edge of its deep convection, with little 
deep convection present in its northeast quadrant. This is due, at 
least in part, to upper-level easterly winds that are causing some 
shear across the cyclone. A consensus of objective and subjective 
intensity estimates from SAB, TAFB, and UW-CIMSS support an initial 
intensity of 45 kt for this advisory, which also agree well with 
earlier ASCAT data.

The aforementioned wind shear is expected to persist for at least 
another day or two, which should limit the potential for 
strengthening. After around 36 h, global models indicate the shear 
will begin to decrease, which should allow for more strengthening. 
The exact timing of this strengthening is still highly uncertain, 
with several global models suggesting it could begin near the 36 h 
mark, while the HWRF indicates it won't begin to strengthen until 
closer to 60 h. Regardless, there is a good chance that Gilma will 
become a hurricane at some point before the end of the week. No 
significant changes were made to the intensity forecast, which 
follows the HCCA and IVCN intensity models. 

The track forecast is also largely unchanged from the previous NHC 
advisory. Gilma is currently moving west near 12 kt. A ridge 
extending westward from the southwest United States should keep 
Gilma on a similar heading today. After that, the tropical storm 
may interact with another disturbance to its west, while a trough 
off the U.S. west coast will begin to erode the ridge slightly. All 
models indicate that Gilma will generally slow down and turn 
west-northwestward in response to these steering changes, but there 
is unusually high spread in the guidance on the exact track the 
cyclone will take. The NHC track forecast follows the consensus 
aids, but confidence in the specifics of the forecast is lower than 
normal due to the high model spread.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR PORTIONS OF
WESTERN INTO NORTH-CENTRAL MONTANA...EASTERN MONTANA...AND EASTERN
COLORADO...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are possible across portions of
Montana and eastern Colorado during the afternoon and evening. 
Large hail and severe gusts are the primary hazards.

...Synopsis...
Water-vapor imagery this morning shows a mid- to upper-level ridge
situated over the south-central High Plains northward through the
northern Great Plains.  A mid-level trough is over the East and a
mid-level low and associated trough are over the eastern Pacific to
the west of the Pacific Northwest.  

...Portions of the central and northern Rockies/High Plains...
Broad 40+ kt southwesterly 500 mb flow will overspread portions of
the central into the northern Rockies as an impulse embedded in the
West Coast mid-level trough grazes the region.  Isolated to
scattered thunderstorms are forecast across Montana with locally
greater thunderstorm coverage forecast over western into
north-central MT this afternoon and evening, and separately over
portions of eastern Montana.  Richer moisture is evident in morning
surface analysis across eastern MT where lower 60s F surface
dewpoints are present with mid 50s farther west near the I-15
corridor.  Consequently, greater buoyancy is expected later this
afternoon over eastern MT with 2000+ J/kg MLCAPE possible with
750-1250 J/kg farther west.  Given the deep boundary layer and
corresponding steep lapse rates in both areas, severe gusts are
possible with the more intense cells and clusters, especially if a
linear cluster can evolve near the Rocky Mtn Front and push
northeastward into the High Plains.  Elsewhere, isolated instances
of hail/wind may accompany the stronger thunderstorms from the
eastern Great Basin northward into ID/WY.  

...Eastern Colorado...
Moist upslope flow during peak surface heating will result in
thunderstorm initiation off of the higher terrain.  Surface
dewpoints in the low 60s F beneath 7.5-8 C/km mid-level lapse rates
will support over 2000 J/kg MLCAPE.  Modest veering and
strengthening of the vertical wind profile will contribute to 30-40
kts of effective bulk shear and modestly elongated hodographs. Some
of the stronger multicells and transient supercells may yield a risk
for large hail and severe gusts beginning mid afternoon through the
early evening.

...North Carolina into the Northeast...
At least scattered thunderstorms will develop amid weak vertical
wind shear this afternoon ahead of a cold front.  Pulse cellular and
occasional multicells are the expected storm mode. Rich low-level
moisture preceding the front will contribute to 1000-2000 J/kg
MLCAPE, which may support a few strong, potentially damaging gusts
with some of the stronger storms.

...North Florida...
A couple of strong thunderstorms may develop along the trailing
portion of a cold front by afternoon. Similar to the Northeast, rich
low-level moisture will promote 2000-3000 J/kg MLCAPE, fostering wet
downburst/strong wind gust potential with pulse single cells and
multicells.

...Sabine River Valley...
Ongoing clusters of weak thunderstorms moving southward on the
backside of the Eastern U.S. mid-level trough will likely continue
southward through the Sabine River Valley today.  Although the 12
UTC Lake Charles raob is characterized as only weakly unstable,
additional heating will result in moderate destabilization by
midday.  A localized wind-damage risk may accompany the stronger
outflow surges before this activity moves into the northwest Gulf.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM THE MIDDLE
ATLANTIC TO THE DEEP SOUTH...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered wind damage will be possible from the Mid-Atlantic States
to the Deep South from mid-afternoon to early evening on Sunday.

...Middle Atlantic to Deep South...

Great Lakes/OH Valley upper trough will shift east today with a
19/00z position forecast along the spine of the Appalachians. Modest
500mb flow should extend within the base of the trough into the
Middle Atlantic. This flow regime will aid the organizational
potential of convection that evolves ahead of the primary synoptic
front. Latest model guidance suggests a weak surface low may develop
over northern VA/MD by late afternoon and this feature should track
into NJ during the overnight hours. While deep-layer flow is not
forecast to be exceptionally strong, 0-6km bulk shear will exceed
30kt within a warm-advection zone. Forecast soundings favor storm
rotation and a few supercells may ultimately evolve across this
region. In addition to damaging wind threat, some risk for hail and
perhaps a brief tornado can be expected.

Trailing front across the Deep South will not be particularly
convergent as it surges into GA-AL-MS. Pre-frontal boundary layer
will be adequately buoyant for robust updrafts and any storms that
evolve ahead of the wind shift will do so within an environment that
favors some organization. Convection will propagate southeast toward
the Gulf Coast as northwesterly flow deepens with trough passage.

...Rockies/Central Plains...

Water-vapor imagery depicts a well-defined short-wave trough topping
the Rockies ridge over western WY at this time. This feature will
track southeast across the central Plains this afternoon as a 500mb
speed max translates into the lower MO Valley. LLJ will respond to
this feature which should contribute to an extensive zone of
elevated convection early in the period. This activity will
propagate southeast along a sharp corridor of warm advection into
eastern KS, then into the lower MS Valley during the overnight
hours. Have increased severe probabilities to account for this
evolution. Primary concern is damaging winds.

...Interior West...

Isolated strong/locally severe thunderstorms will once again develop
across western UT and track north-northeast along the
western/northern periphery of the dominant anticyclone. Gusty winds
are possible with this diurnally enhanced activity.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ALONG/JUST EAST OF
THE WASHINGTON/OREGON CASCADES...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms will spread across portions of
southwest Washington this evening. Hail/wind remain possible.
Isolated damaging gusts are also expected with convection across
portions of the southern Appalachians into the Ohio Valley.

...01z Update...

Notable short-wave trough is currently ejecting north across
northern CA into western OR. Water-vapor imagery also suggests a
lead disturbance may be associated with a fairly extensive cluster
of deep convection as it advances across northern OR into southwest
WA. Surface temperatures are holding in the lower 90s across lower
elevations of southern WA east of the Cascades. Latest diagnostic
data suggests a narrow corridor of higher instability extends
along/just east of the Cascades. While convection should
spread/develop north along the higher terrain, northeasterly
low-level flow should contribute to robust updrafts capable of
generating hail/wind.

Northwesterly flow is deepening across the southern Appalachians
early this evening as the upper trough progresses steadily east. A
broken band of organized convection is propagating southeast across
northwestern SC/northern GA through an axis of instability
characterized by 1500 MLCAPE. This activity may produce locally
damaging gusts for the next few hours, but otherwise will gradually
decrease in intensity as boundary layer cools this evening.

More isolated convection is observed across KY into the upper OH
Valley. This activity will also gradually wane in intensity as the
evening progresses and low-level lapse rates weaken. Until then, a
few gusts may be noted.
