Mesoscale Discussion 0420
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0933 AM CDT Thu Apr 11 2024

Areas affected...northern and central Florida

Concerning...Tornado Watch 104...

Valid 111433Z - 111630Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 104 continues.

SUMMARY...A broken band of thunderstorms continues moving eastward
across northern Florida, where local severe-weather risk continues.

DISCUSSION...Latest radar loop shows a loosely organized band of
thunderstorms extending from the southeastern Georgia coast
southwestward to the eastern Gulf of Mexico west of Tampa.  Storms
have remained largely sub-severe despite very favorable deep-layer
shear, due to an overall lack of appreciable buoyancy.  The 12Z TBW
RAOB shows a deeply moist airmass, but very weak lapse rates, with
several warm layers that hint at subdued updraft acceleration,
confirming the character of convection at this time per radar
reflectivity.

With that said, filtered heating through high cirrus ahead of the
convection has allowed heating to commence, with surface
temperatures having risen a few degrees over the past 1 to 2 hours. 
Continued insolation/heating will allow destabilization eventually
permit more unimpeded updrafts, and a corresponding increase in
convective intensity/organization, aided by the favorable background
kinematic environment.  As such, local severe risk -- including
isolated tornado potential -- should gradually increase over the
next couple of hours.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0752 AM CDT Thu Apr 11 2024

Valid 111300Z - 121200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR EASTERN
OHIO AND NORTHWEST WEST VIRGINIA...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR FAR SOUTHERN
GEORGIA INTO NORTH AND CENTRAL PARTS OF FLORIDA...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms with a few tornadoes, scattered damaging winds,
and isolated large hail are possible across the upper Ohio River
Valley and parts of the Appalachians this afternoon.  Scattered
damaging winds and a couple of tornadoes are possible in far
southern Georgia into central Florida, mainly this morning through
early afternoon.

...Synopsis...
Water-vapor imagery this morning shows a potent mid-level low/trough
centered near the AR/MS/TN border with an upstream trough over the
Upper Midwest forecast to phase with the Southeast trough.  A
cyclone near the TN/MS border will deepen as it develops
north-northeast into the Lower Great Lakes by early evening.  A
trailing surface cold front will push east across portions of the
Southeast/southern Appalachians during the day, before clearing the
Southeast coast by early Friday morning.  

...Upper OH River Valley...
Considerable uncertainty remains for this forecast in terms of the
magnitude of destabilization across the OH Valley late this morning
through the afternoon.  This uncertainty is primarily due to low
cloud cover and weak capping resulting in scattered
showers/low-topped thunderstorm activity and the potential to remain
relatively cool in the boundary layer.  However, mid-level dry air
evident in water-vapor imagery is wrapping through the base of the
mid-level low/trough over TN, and this mid-level dry intrusion
forecast to spread northeast into portions of the Upper OH Valley. 
Weak instability coupled with some enlargement of the hodograph can
support an environment in which discrete cells and semi-discrete
clusters evolve into supercells.  A few tornadoes are possible if
stronger updrafts/supercells manage to develop, in addition to an
accompanying threat for damaging gusts and perhaps marginally severe
hail.  

...Florida/Georgia...
Ongoing pre-frontal broken band of strong to severe thunderstorms
over north FL and the eastern Gulf of Mexico will gradually shift
east across the northern half of the Peninsula through the morning
and into the afternoon.  The northern rim of rich low-level moisture
(upper 60s to lower 70s deg F surface dewpoints) have advected into
north FL early this morning.  Although lapse rates will remain
modest, it appears the richer moisture will contribute to adequate
surface-based buoyancy (500-1250 J/kg MLCAPE) across the northern
half of the Peninsula today.  The Jacksonville and Tampa 88D VAD
wind profiles are quite strong this morning and will likely remain
so through the early afternoon as the larger-scale mid-level trough
pivots eastward over the FL Peninsula by early evening.  The risk
for a couple of tornadoes and damaging gusts will likely maximize
through the midday before the thunderstorm band moves offshore and
forcing for ascent gradually abates by late afternoon as the
synoptic low lifts well to the north.

...Mid-Atlantic states into Carolinas...
A less focused and more conditional severe risk seems evident for
the Carolinas later this afternoon and northward into the
Mid-Atlantic states this evening as the upper trough encroaches on
the general region.  A broad warm-air advection regime north of the
FL/GA early-day MCS will slowly destabilize today, aided in part by
lower 60 deg F dewpoints north, mid to upper 60s south.  Long
hodographs will favor storm organization with any robust updrafts. 
Isolated to widely scattered strong to severe storms capable of a
threat for damaging gusts and a couple of tornadoes are possible,
mainly over parts of western VA, with lower coverage expected
farther east over the coastal plain/Delmarva.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0214 AM CDT Thu Apr 11 2024

Valid 121200Z - 131200Z

...Synopsis...
Fire weather conditions are anticipated across a broad swath of the
Southwest and southern High Plains on Friday afternoon. However, the
fire weather threat will most likely be focused across parts of New
Mexico and the OK/TX Panhandles where the best overlap of fire
weather conditions and receptive fuels is anticipated. Surface high
pressure is forecast to shift from the central Plains into the
northwest Gulf of Mexico. Concurrently, the approach of an upper
wave off the southern CA coast will lead to broad surface pressure
falls across the southern Great Basin into the southern High Plains,
resulting in breezy pressure gradient winds.

...New Mexico and adjacent areas of the OK/TX Panhandles...
Latest guidance continues to show a signal for 15-20 mph winds
across a broad swath of eastern NM and west TX. Low-level
trajectories emanating off the terrain of northern Mexico, combined
with a recent frontal intrusion into the western Gulf, should
maintain dry conditions across the southern High Plains with RH
values in the 10-20% range. Elevated conditions are expected with
localized critical conditions possible Friday afternoon. Despite the
potential for widespread fire weather conditions, the risk area is
confined to locations that have not seen wetting rainfall over the
past few days (and hence should have the most receptive fuels).
Based on recent fuel analyses, ERCs further west into the
Southwest/Great Basin are near/below the 50th percentile, which
precludes a more widespread risk area (though fuel trends will be
monitored).

Tornado Watch Number 101
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
600 AM CDT Wed Apr 10 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Southeast Louisiana
  Central and Southern Mississippi
  Coastal Waters

* Effective this Wednesday morning and afternoon from 600 AM
  until 100 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A few tornadoes likely with a couple intense tornadoes possible
  Widespread damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 80
    mph likely
  Scattered large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...A destabilizing airmass across the central Gulf Coast will
support an increasing severe thunderstorm and tornado risk this
morning into the midday.  The tornado risk will likely maximize with
any supercells that develop within the warm sector as the marine
warm front advances northward.  A squall line will move west to east
across the area with a risk for damaging gusts and the tornado risk
will likely focus with any sustained mesovortex or embedded
supercell.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 85 statute miles
east and west of a line from 95 miles northwest of Meridian MS to 45
miles west southwest of Boothville LA. For a complete depiction of
the watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS
WOU1).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

Mesoscale Discussion 0395
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0848 AM CDT Tue Apr 09 2024

Areas affected...Portions of central/east TX into northwestern LA

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 091348Z - 091545Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...A watch may be needed as the threat for tornadoes, large
hail, and damaging winds gradually increases this morning.

DISCUSSION...Warm advection associated with a 35-45 kt southerly
low-level jet, along with ascent attendant to the left exit region
of a southwesterly mid/upper-level jet, is aiding convection across
parts of central/east TX into northwestern LA. Some of this activity
across central TX is occurring near a convectively reinforced
outflow boundary, with a rich low-level airmass present along/south
of this boundary. Steep mid-level lapse rates are supporting
1500-2000 J/kg of MLCAPE in central TX, even though daytime heating
remains muted thus far, with lesser instability into east TX and
northwestern LA. Still, strong deep-layer shear of 50+ kt will
foster updraft organization and supercell potential. Large to very
large hail will be a concern with these supercells as they spread
east-northeastward this morning. An increasing potential for
severe/damaging winds may be realized if a cluster forms along the
outflow boundary/front. Sufficient low-level shear is also present
for low-level updraft rotation and some tornado threat. Watch
issuance may be needed if convection continues to increase in
coverage and intensity across central TX.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 94
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
940 AM CDT Tue Apr 9 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Central Texas

* Effective this Tuesday morning and afternoon from 940 AM until
  500 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A few tornadoes possible
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2.5
    inches in diameter likely
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...Several thunderstorm clusters, including a mix of
supercells and bowing line segments, are expected along a stalled
front across central Texas through the afternoon.  More isolated
supercell development will be possible later this morning into early
this afternoon into the I-35 corridor closer to Austin.  The storm
environment will support the potential for large hail up to 2.5
inches in diameter, damaging gusts of 60-70 mph, and potentially a
few tornadoes.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 40 statute miles
north and south of a line from 50 miles west of Austin TX to 140
miles east northeast of Temple TX. For a complete depiction of the
watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU4).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 2.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 60 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 550. Mean
storm motion vector 25025.

...Thompson
