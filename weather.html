Mexico:<br><br>1. East of the Leeward Islands (AL94):<br>A
poorly-defined trough of low pressure located a couple of hundred
<br>miles east of the Leeward Islands is producing some disorganized
<br>showers and thunderstorms. Development, if any, of this disturbance
<br>should be slow to occur while it moves quickly westward to
<br>west-northwestward at around 20 mph, passing near the Virgin Islands
<br>and Puerto Rico on Friday, then near Hispaniola and the southeastern
<br>Bahamas on Saturday. By late this weekend, further development is
<br>not expected due to strong upper-level winds.<br>* Formation chance
through 48 hours…low…10 percent.<br>* Formation chance through 7
days…low…20 percent.<br><br /> 2. Western Caribbean Sea
(AL95):<br>Satellite images show a broad area of low pressure over the
western <br>Caribbean Sea is gradually becoming better defined, and
nearby buoy <br>observations indicate surface pressures are falling. The
associated <br>shower and thunderstorm activity has increased since
yesterday, and <br>environmental conditions appear conducive for some
additional <br>development over the next couple of days. A short-lived
tropical <br>depression or storm could form before the system moves
inland over <br>Belize and the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico on Saturday.
Regardless <br>of development, locally heavy rainfall is likely across
portions of <br>Central America and southern Mexico through the
weekend.<br>* Formation chance through 48 hours…medium…40 percent.<br>*
Formation chance through 7 days…medium…40 percent.<br><br />

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0458 PM CDT Thu Oct 17 2024

Valid 191200Z - 251200Z

On the backside of a closed midlevel low over the Four Corners
region, moderate deep-layer northerly flow will persist across
southern CA early on Day 3/Saturday. This mid/upper-level support,
combined with a tight pressure gradient, will yield a continuation
of dry/breezy offshore flow -- favoring elevated to locally critical
conditions into early Day 3/Saturday. Thereafter, deep-layer winds
and the pressure gradient will both weaken across southern CA,
though dry conditions will continue. 

The closed midlevel low/trough will continue east-northeastward
across the central Rockies into early next week, with breezy winds
expected across the Plains. However, low-level moisture return and
eventual precipitation will limit RH reductions and the overall
fire-weather risk.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook

0258 PM CDT Thu Oct 17 2024

Valid 181200Z - 191200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF VENTURA...LOS
ANGELES...SAN BERNARDINO...AND RIVERSIDE COUNTIES IN SOUTHERN
CALIFORNIA...

A Critical area was added over portions of Ventura, Los Angeles, San
Bernardino, and Riverside Counties in southern California. The
latest high-resolution guidance consensus lends increased confidence
in the overlap of strong offshore winds (gusts ranging from 45 to 55
mph) and single-digit to lower-teens RH on Friday morning/afternoon,
and potentially again during the early morning hours on Saturday.
The best overlap of the strong/gusty winds and low RH are expected
over the typical wind-prone valleys/mountains (e.g., San Gabriel,
Santa Monica, and Santa Ana Mountains and foothills). Upon
coordination with the local forecast offices, fuels are supportive
of large-fire spread, warranting the upgrade to Critical. 

Elsewhere, the previous forecast (see below) remains on track.

..Weinman.. 10/17/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0153 AM CDT Thu Oct 17 2024/

...Synopsis...
As a surface low settles into the Southwest, strong southerly flow
will continue across the Central and Southern Plains. This low-level
flow will advect moisture northward which will eliminate most of the
fire weather concern across the Plains. 

Very strong mid-level flow will overspread the Southwest as a
compact upper-level cyclone slides east-southeast. Sustained winds
of 30+ mph are likely beneath the strongest mid-level flow. Fuels
across Arizona and New Mexico are not critically dry and therefore,
no fire weather concerns have been highlighted at this time. 

However, dry fuels are present across California where some Elevated
fire weather conditions are likely within the Central Valley,
Coastal Ranges of the central and northern portions of the state,
and in terrain favored areas of southern California. In addition to
the strong winds Friday afternoon, the Santa Ana winds will likely
strengthen again 06-12Z Saturday. This will occur as the LAX-TPH
gradient strengthens to near 10-12 mb as diurnal cooling, and high
pressure in the Great Basin strengthens the pressure gradient across
southern California.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0236 PM CDT Thu Oct 17 2024

Valid 172000Z - 181200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Organized severe thunderstorms are not expected through tonight.

...20z Update...
The previous outlook remains valid with no changes. Scattered
thunderstorms are possible across the Great Basin and Rockies ahead
of a deep upper trough and cold front this afternoon through
tonight. An isolated stronger storm may be capable of strong outflow
wind gusts, but organized severe storms are not expected. See the
prior outlook for additional information.

..Lyons.. 10/17/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1110 AM CDT Thu Oct 17 2024/

...Western States...
A large upper trough will dig southeastward across the mountainous
west today and tonight.  This will provide increasing large-scale
ascent and increasing mid-level moisture for scattered showers and
thunderstorms across much of the Rockies and Great Basin.  Visible
satellite imagery shows widespread high clouds over much of this
area, which should limit daytime heating and destabilization. 
Strengthening winds aloft could pose a risk for gusty winds in the
strongest cells this afternoon, but the risk of severe storms
appears low.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0731 AM CDT Thu Oct 17 2024

Valid 171300Z - 181200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Organized severe thunderstorms are not expected through tonight.

...Synopsis...
In mid/upper levels, a highly amplified yet progressive pattern will
persist through the period, as a strong, synoptic-scale ridge shifts
eastward over the Great Lakes, and the Mississippi/Ohio/Tennessee
Valleys.  Upstream, a strong trough now near the coastal Pacific
Northwest will dig southeastward across interior parts of the West
Coast States today into this evening, and much of the western Great
Basin/Intermountain regions overnight.  By 12Z, a 500-mb low should
form over eastern NV, along a trough extending from the northern
Rockies to the lower Colorado River Valley.  As that occurs, a
weaker, shortwave trough -- evident in moisture-channel imagery near
the NV/UT and CA/AZ borders, should eject northeastward over the
central Rockies and central/northern High Plains, while weakening. 
By the end of the period, broadly cyclonic flow will cover most of
the western CONUS.

Ahead of the strengthening main (Pacific Northwest) trough, height
falls and areas of DCVA/cooling aloft are forecast.  Those will
overlie a southeastward-surging low-level cold front across the
Intermountain region, and support isolated to widely scattered
thunderstorm potential over a vast swath of the West, either side of
the front.  Meager but sufficient low/midlevel moisture -- mostly
with distant/indirect origins in the subtropical gulfs either side
of northern Mexico -- will support this convection.  Strong gusts
may accompany some of the afternoon and early evening activity
along/ahead of the cold front across northern parts of NV/UT, amidst
strengthening deep shear.  However, overall moisture/buoyancy appear
too meager to outline an unconditional severe area at this time.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1107 AM CDT Wed Oct 16 2024

Valid 161630Z - 171200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Organized severe thunderstorms are not expected.

...Great Basin...
A weak upper trough and pockets of residual mid-level moisture will
result in scattered showers and thunderstorms across much of the
Great Basin today.  Model guidance suggests a weak mid-level speed
max moving across the Four Corners region into western CO.  Steep
low and mid level lapse rates could aid in locally gusty winds in
the strongest cells.  No organized severe storms are expected.

Other thunderstorms will occur beneath an upper trough affecting the
Pacific Northwest states.  Finally, a few thunderstorms are possible
in a warm/moist air mass present across south TX and south FL.
