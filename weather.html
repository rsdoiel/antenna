Mesoscale Discussion 2136
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0919 AM CDT Wed Oct 09 2024

Areas affected...Portions of South Florida

Concerning...Tornado Watch 690...

Valid 091419Z - 091545Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 690 continues.

SUMMARY...Potential for tornadoes will continue late this morning
into the afternoon. The threat will gradually expand northward as
heating destabilizes the boundary layer. Wind fields will also
increasingly support tornadoes with time.

DISCUSSION...Low-level rotation has been increasing in two supercell
storms south of Lake Okeechobee. One storm produced a tornado in
Collier County just before moving into Hendry County. More recently,
the storm in central Broward County produced a tornado as well.
Storms earlier this morning generally began to weaken near Lake
Okeechobee, but temperatures have been increasing with surface
heating. That being said, the tornado threat will likely begin to
extend farther north over the next few hours. Additional updrafts in
eastern Collier County have also been slowly deepening over the last
hour. This activity could intensify and similarly be capable of
producing a tornado. Potential for tornadoes, including a strong
tornado, should continue to increase as stronger low-level flow
across the peninsula expands as Milton moves eastward and its wind
field concurrently expands.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0745 AM CDT Wed Oct 09 2024

Valid 091300Z - 101200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN FLORIDA PENINSULA...

...SUMMARY...
Several tornadoes are likely today and tonight across parts of the
central/southern Florida Peninsula in association with Hurricane
Milton.

...Florida...
Hurricane Milton will continue moving northeastward today per the
latest NHC forecast track, making landfall along the west-central FL
Gulf Coast by tonight. South-southeasterly low-level flow has been
steadily increasing this morning across the Keys and south FL per
VWPs from KBYX/KAMX. A corresponding increase in low-level (0-1 km)
shear has also been noted from the 12Z observed soundings at
KEY/MFL. As Hurricane Milton approaches the central/southern FL
Peninsula later today, southerly 850 mb flow is expected to
strengthen even more across these areas through the afternoon and
evening. This will further enhance effective SRH and potential for
supercells. Filtered daytime heating over the FL Peninsula away from
ongoing precipitation should prove instrumental in helping
surface-based convection become established and aiding in the
development of weak to moderate instability this afternoon, as low
levels are already rather moist (mid to upper 70s surface dewpoints)
along/south of a weak baroclinic zone draped across the central FL
Peninsula.

Current expectations are for ongoing confluence bands off the
southwest FL Coast and far south FL to persist through the rest of
the morning. Convection within these outer rain bands will likely
strengthen through the day as diurnal heating aids in steepening of
low-level lapse rates, and as shear increases with Milton's
approach. Multiple supercells should develop and persist within
these bands in a rather favorable thermodynamic and kinematic
environment that will support updraft rotation and the potential for
several tornadoes. The greatest tornado potential should be focused
this afternoon and evening across parts of central and south FL,
generally along/south of where a weak surface front is forecast to
reside. A strong tornado (EF-2) could occur in this zone where
low-level shear is forecast to be maximized, but confidence remains
somewhat low given the tropical nature of thunderstorms anticipated.
The tornado threat will continue this evening and gradually shift
eastward across the FL Peninsula tonight through early Thursday
morning, before eventually waning/moving offshore.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1202 PM CDT Sun Oct 06 2024

Valid 071200Z - 081200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated to scattered thunderstorms will be possible across parts of
southern New England and the Florida Peninsula on Monday, but severe
thunderstorms are not expected.

...Synopsis...

An upper trough will deepen over the Great Lakes and spread east
over the Northeast on Monday. Meanwhile, a surface cold front will
shift east/southeast across much of the eastern and southeastern
U.S. through early Tuesday. Isolated thunderstorms may be ongoing
across parts of southern New England Monday morning ahead of the
cold front. This activity should move offshore by midday/early
afternoon and pose little risk for severe thunderstorms. The front
will become stalled over north FL, with a moist (60s to low 70s F
dewpoints) airmass across much of the Peninsula. Daytime heating
will allow for modest destabilization, supporting isolated to
scattered thunderstorm activity, particularly south of the Lake
Okeechobee vicinity. Weak instability and poor lapse rates will
preclude severe thunderstorm potential. 

Meanwhile, Milton is forecast by the National Hurricane Center to
become a hurricane today (Sunday). The tropical system will
strengthen on Monday as it tracks across the south-central Gulf of
Mexico. However, Milton should remain far enough west of the Florida
Keys/southwest FL that tropical cyclone related tornado activity is
not expected through early Tuesday morning.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1157 AM CDT Sun Oct 06 2024

Valid 061700Z - 071200Z

...17z Update...
The previous outlook remains valid with minor modifications. Dry and
windy conditions are likely across parts of the Midwest and Great
Lakes behind a strong cold front. The Elevated area was expanded
slightly north across parts of Lower MI, where dry and breezy
conditions appear more likely to overlap with receptive fuels for a
few hours this afternoon. Otherwise, the Elevated area remains
largely unchanged, see the prior discussion for more information.

..Lyons.. 10/06/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1250 AM CDT Sun Oct 06 2024/

...Synopsis...
A large upper-level trough positioned over the Great Lakes region
will shift east throughout the day, while a broad zone of enhanced
mid-level flow overspreads much of the northern Great Plains. At the
surface, a cold front will continue to progress southeastward,
draped across parts of the Ohio Valley early in the day and reaching
parts of the Mid-Atlantic by the end of the period. Consequently,
gusty post-frontal northwesterly winds will manifest throughout the
afternoon/evening across a broad area of the upper Midwest.
Sustained winds of 15 mph with RH values into the 20-30 percent
range will be common across this region amid fuels that appear at
least marginally receptive to large-fire spread. Therefore, the area
delineating elevated fire-weather conditions has been maintained for
the region, with a minor expansion made into parts of northern Ohio
and southeastern portions of the LP of Michigan.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
EASTERN OHIO...WESTERN NEW YORK/PENNSYLVANIA...AND NORTHERN WEST
VIRGINIA...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated to scattered severe thunderstorms are forecast later this
afternoon into the evening from parts of eastern Ohio into western
New York/Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and western Maryland. 
Damaging winds and large hail are the primary severe hazards.

...Upper Ohio Valley into the Lower Great Lakes and Central
Appalachians...
Midday water-vapor imagery shows a potent mid- to upper-level trough
over Ontario and the Great Lakes.  A speed max initially over
northern WI/western U.P. of MI will quickly move east-southeast into
the Lower Great Lakes through early evening.  Strong, attendant
forcing for ascent associated with this disturbance will overspread
southwest Ontario into eastern OH by the mid-late afternoon. 
Coincidentally, a cold front over the Great Lakes will sweep
eastward.  A narrow plume of moisture will protrude northeastward
through the Upper OH Valley with surface dewpoints generally in the
mid to upper 50s.  Mid-level cooling associated with the trough will
act to steepen 700-500 mb lapse rates to around 7 deg C/km by
mid-late afternoon immediately ahead of the cold front.  Forecast
soundings show generally 500-1000 J/kg of MLCAPE by mid afternoon
and weakened convective inhibition.  The nose of the cyclonically
curved upper jet will nose into the region and contribute to
effective shear 35-50 kt.

The latest model guidance suggests convective initiation occurring
over the northeast OH vicinity between 20-22z.  This initial
development will likely be supercellular given the strong deep-layer
shear, with an associated threat for severe hail given favorable
lapse rates aloft. A brief tornado or two may also occur. But, a
transition to a convective band featuring a mix of cells and linear
segments is anticipated given the linear forcing of the cold front.
As this occurs, the threat for scattered damaging winds should
quickly increase as convection moves east-southeastward from eastern
OH across western NY/PA and into WV/western MD. Given the fairly
narrow warm sector, this activity should weaken by mid evening with
the loss of daytime heating, and as it encounters a much less
unstable airmass in the central Appalachians.
