Mesoscale Discussion 1334
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0325 PM CDT Tue Jun 17 2025

Areas affected...Southeast Wyoming...southern Nebraska
Panhandle...Front Range into northeast Colorado

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 428...

Valid 172025Z - 172200Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 428
continues.

SUMMARY...Severe wind gust potential increasing just east of the
I-25 corridor and along I-80 in southeast Wyoming and the Nebraska
Panhandle. How far east this activity can maintain intensity is not
clear.

DISCUSSION...Linear convection has increased in intensity east of
Cheyenne and along the I-25 corridor. The most organized wind
signal, per KCYS velocity data, is moving roughly along I-80 east of
Cheyenne. A 69 mph wind gusts was measured with this activity.
Additionally, KFTG is showing a modest increase in wind potential
just east of the I-25 corridor. Areas of the Nebraska Panhandle into
northeast Colorado did receive longer periods of insolation this
afternoon. Farther east, outflow from morning convection has
modified a small degree. While severe wind gusts will become more
probable in the short term, the eastward extent of this threat is
not clear given at least pockets of MLCIN remaining.

Tropical Storm Erick Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052025
300 PM CST Tue Jun 17 2025
 
Erick has continued to become better organized in visible satellite 
imagery, with an extended cloud band curling one revolution around 
the center.  However, there is also some evidence of a dry slot 
filtering into the circulation from the southeast, and possibly as 
a result, infrared cloud top temperatures in the band are not as 
cold as they could be.  Subjective Dvorak classifications have 
risen to T3.0/45 kt from TAFB and T3.5/55 kt from SAB, but the 
initial intensity is held conservatively at 45 kt since objective 
numbers are closest to the TAFB estimate.

The center appears to have turned northwestward (310 degrees) and 
is moving around 6 kt.  A mid-level ridge to the north of the 
cyclone, and a mid-/upper-level trough over northern Mexico, should 
keep Erick on a generally northwestward trajectory for the next 
couple of days, with a gradual increase in forward speed.  The NHC 
forecast track lies close to the HCCA and TVCE consensus aids, and 
it a little east of the previous prediction.  Because of the 
oblique angle of Erick's track relative to the coast, it is 
impossible to know exactly where the strongest winds might occur, 
but it is becoming increasingly likely that they will occur in the 
area of western Oaxaca or eastern Guerrero states.
 
Despite the current convective pattern, the environment of low wind 
shear, high mid-level moisture, and warm sea surface temperatures 
should still support rapid strengthening.  Erick also has the 
structure to enable rapid intensification, and it may only take 
mixing out some of the dry air for that process to begin.  Rapid 
intensification (RI) indices fell a little on this forecast cycle, 
mainly due to a negative contribution from the influx of drier 
boundary layer air.  However, assuming this dry air can mix out, 
the NHC intensity forecast continues to be near the high end of the 
guidance (closest to HCCA and HMON), and still shows Erick near or 
at major hurricane strength when it approaches the coast of 
southern Mexico.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Erick is expected to rapidly intensify before reaching the coast
of southern Mexico on Thursday, and a hurricane warning is in effect 
for portions of the coast of Oaxaca.  A hurricane watch is in effect 
for portions of the Guerrero coast.
 
2. Erick will produce heavy rainfall across portions of Central 
America and Southwest Mexico through this week.  Life-threatening 
flooding and mudslides are possible, especially in areas of steep 
terrain.
 
3. A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce coastal flooding
near and to the east of where the center crosses the coast, in
areas of onshore winds.

36 hours before the anticipated first occurrence of
tropical-storm-force winds, conditions that make outside
preparations difficult or dangerous.  Preparations to protect life
and property should be rushed to completion.
 
A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible
within the watch area.  A watch is typically issued 48 hours
before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force
winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or
dangerous.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.
 
Watches and warnings may be extended westward along the coast later
today or tonight.  Interests elsewhere in southern Mexico should
monitor the progress of Erick.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 PM CST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Erick was
located near latitude 12.9 North, longitude 94.4 West.  Erick is
moving toward the northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h).  A northwestward 
motion with a gradual increase in forward speed is expected over 
the next couple of days.  On the forecast track, the center of Erick 
is expected to approach the coast of southern Mexico Wednesday 
night and move inland or be near the coast on Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Rapid strengthening is forecast during the next day or two, and 
Erick is expected to become a hurricane by tonight or early 
Wednesday.  Erick is forecast to be near or at major hurricane 
strength when it approaches the coast of southern Mexico Wednesday 
night and Thursday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Erick can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP5 and WMO header
WTPZ45 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Storm Erick could produce rainfall totals of 8 to
16 inches, with maximum totals of 20 inches, across the Mexican
states of Oaxaca and Guerrero. This rainfall may produce life
threatening flooding and mudslides, especially in areas of steep
terrain. Rainfall totals of 3 to 5 inches, with maximum totals of 8
inches, are possible across the Mexican states of Chiapas,
Michoacan, Colima and Jalisco.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Tropical Storm Erick, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep5.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning
area Wednesday night and Thursday and possible in the hurricane
watch area on Thursday.  Tropical storm conditions are expected in
the tropical storm warning area late Wednesday and Wednesday night.
 
STORM SURGE: Dangerous storm surge is expected to produce coastal
flooding near and to the east of where the center crosses the coast
in areas of onshore winds.  The surge will be accompanied by large
and destructive waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Erick are expected to begin affecting the
coast of southern Mexico in a day or so.  These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0300 PM CDT Tue Jun 17 2025

Valid 172000Z - 181200Z

...THERE IS A MODERATE RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS
OF NORTHERN OKLAHOMA AND SOUTHERN KANSAS...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms producing numerous to widespread damaging
winds, scattered large hail (isolated 2+ inches), and a few
tornadoes are expected this afternoon and evening across parts of
the central/southern Plains. The greatest threat for destructive
gusts up to 70-100 mph is forecast across portions of southern
Kansas and northern Oklahoma.

...20z Update Southern Plains...
A convective reinforced outflow boundary across west-central KS
continues to slowly push southward across southwest portions of the
state to near the OK border. This boundary will likely serve as the
focus for robust convective development this afternoon and evening,
as indicated by elevated development farther east. To the north of
the primary surface heating, this initial activity may quickly grow
upscale into one or more clusters before spreading southeast and
becoming more surface-based with time. Large to very large hail,
damaging gusts and some tornado risk are likely with these storms.

Across northwest OK, and the northeastern TX Panhandle, additional,
more isolated storms are likely this afternoon along the southern
most modified outflow and pseudo-triple point area. Surface obs and
18z AMA/LMN RAOBs show substantial low-level shear, large buoyancy
and favorable deep-layer shear for supercells capable of very large
hail and a few tornadoes across northern OK and far southern KS.
Current expectations are still that initially cellular convection
will rapidly develop and pose a severe risk through the afternoon,
before growing upscale as it interacts with additional storms over
KS this evening. One or more organized bows/clusters, capable of
very strong damaging gusts, hail and a couple of tornadoes are
likely this evening. Will maintain the MDT risk with minimal
trimming on the northwest side near the advancing outflow.

...Southeast to the Mid Atlantic...
Several clusters of strong to occasional severe storms are ongoing
and expected to continue this afternoon/evening. Moderate buoyancy
within a very moist air mass could support occasional damaging gusts
from heavily water-loaded downdrafts. Some degree of organization
into loose clusters could continue, especially across AL where
storms have shown slightly stronger cold pools. However, the overall
potential for storm organization is low with vertical shear
remaining quite weak. The severe risk should begin to weaken through
the early evening. Some minor trimming was made to the severe
probabilities along the western edge of the MRGL.

...Rockies...
Scattered severe storms, including a few supercells, will continue
this afternoon. Confidence is highest in the severe threat remaining
near the I-25 corridor where more substantial heating has taken
place. Hail remains the primary risk, though a few damaging gusts
and a brief tornado remain possible.

..Lyons.. 06/17/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1118 AM CDT Tue Jun 17 2025/

...KS/OK...
Overnight and morning thunderstorm activity has significantly
changed the overall forecast for severe storms across the central
Plains for today.  A severe MCS overspread parts of southeast KS and
northeast OK a few hours ago, pushing an outflow boundary southward
into central OK.  Strong heating is occurring to the north of this
boundary, where rapid destabilization is expected this afternoon
across northern OK/southern KS.  A consensus of 12z model guidance
shows this to be the corridor of rapid and intense thunderstorm
development.  Forecast soundings show substantial low-level shear,
steep lapse rates, and sufficient winds aloft for supercells capable
of very large hail and a few tornadoes.  Relatively warm
temperatures in the 850-700mb layer are a negative factor for a
greater tornado concern.  Through the evening, congealing outflows
will likely result in a larger MCS posing a risk of widespread
damaging wind gusts into northeast OK and perhaps parts of northwest
AR/southwest MO.

...Eastern CO/Southeast WY...
Overnight storms also impacted the forecast for this region today. 
Easterly low-level winds (enhanced by outflow) have transported
moisture westward into the foothills, where rapid thunderstorm
development is expected by early afternoon.  Steep mid-level lapse
rates and seasonably cool mid-level temperatures, coupled with
sufficiently strong westerly flow aloft, will promote a risk of very
large hail in the strongest storms.  A tornado or two is also
possible.  It is unclear how far east this activity can make it into
the adjacent Plains, where persistent low-clouds and more stable
conditions will likely prevail.  Refer to MCD #1330 for further
details.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0230 PM CDT Tue Jun 17 2025

Valid 181200Z - 191200Z

Accelerating mid-level westerly flow in advance of an upper-level
short wave will support breezy downslope flow across the Columbia
Basin. Despite a slight intrusion of Pacific moisture, daytime
relative humidity should still fall into the 20-25 percent range.
Coupled with breezy west winds and dry fuels, Elevated highlights
were maintained for the Columbia Basin where dry fuels will support
fire spread.

..Williams.. 06/17/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1257 AM CDT Tue Jun 17 2025/

...Synopsis...
Preceding a deep midlevel low west of British Columbia, a belt of
strong midlevel westerly flow will overspread the Cascades. As a
result, locally dry/breezy downslope flow will develop in the
Columbia Basin during the afternoon. Around 15 mph sustained
westerly surface winds (higher in the Cascade Gaps) and 20-25
percent RH will favor elevated fire-weather conditions.

0221 PM CDT Tue Jun 17 2025

Valid 191200Z - 201200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM NEW ENGLAND
INTO THE MID ATLANTIC...

...SUMMARY...
Strong to potentially severe thunderstorms are forecast on Thursday
from parts of New England into the Mid Atlantic and Carolinas.

...Parts of New England to the Southeast...
A mid-level trough and associated surface cold front will move east
from the eastern Great Lakes to the Atlantic coast on Thursday.
Ahead of this cold front, upper 60s to low 70s dewpoints are
forecast from the southeast to New England. Modest heating ahead of
this front should result in moderate to strong instability ahead of
the cold front Thursday afternoon. Mid-level flow will gradually
strengthen from south to north with increasing storm
organization/severity expected. The most focused zone of a
potentially greater severe weather threat will likely exist from
eastern Pennsylvania northward into eastern New York and Vermont.
While instability is not forecast to be as strong this far north,
strong forcing and strong shear may result in supercells and
organized bowing segments with damaging wind gusts as the primary
hazard. 

...Southwest Montana...
Weak height falls are expected across western Montana on Thursday
afternoon/evening. Weak instability is forecast to develop across
the region as temperatures warm into the 80s. These high-based
thunderstorms will be capable of isolated severe wind gusts given
the very deeply mixed boundary layer and strong shear across the
region. 

...Upper Midwest...
A southeastward moving mid-level shortwave trough will traverse
northern Minnesota and Wisconsin Thursday afternoon. Some
strengthening of the low-level jet is anticipated as this shifts
southeast with increasing isentropic ascent. Moderate instability
within this zone may permit isolated strong to severe storms where
isentropic ascent is maximized. Large hail and damaging wind gusts
would be the primary threat. 

...Northern Plains...
Moderate to strong instability is forecast to develop across the
northern Plains Thursday afternoon/evening. Storms may develop along
the dryline/surface trough. However, rising heights aloft may keep
convective coverage limited across the region. In addition, a
nocturnally strengthening low-level jet may result in additional
strong to severe storm development across portions of the northern
Plains Thursday night.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1203 PM CDT Tue Jun 17 2025

Valid 181200Z - 191200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM SOUTHERN
LOWER MICHIGAN INTO NORTHWEST OHIO...INDIANA...SOUTHERN
ILLINOIS/MISSOURI...AND EXTREME WESTERN KENTUCKY...

...SUMMARY...
Strong to severe storms are expected on Wednesday from parts of
southern Missouri northeastward into southern lower Michigan.
Damaging winds, isolated hail, and a few tornadoes will be possible.
More isolated severe storms may develop across the southern Plains.

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will traverse from MO/IA to the Southern Great
Lakes on Wednesday. A surface low will accompany this mid-level
trough and move from eastern Iowa to Michigan. A cold front will
extend from this surface low to the southern Great Plains. Severe
thunderstorms are expected along much of this frontal zone on
Wednesday.

...Midwest into the Southern Great Lakes...
Upper 60s to low 70s dewpoints will be present ahead of a cold front
across the Midwest/Great Lakes on Wednesday morning. Some cloudcover
is likely across the region, but only minimal heating (mid 70s)
appears necessary for convective initiation. Therefore, expect
relatively early storm development along and ahead of a cold front
north of I-70 during the late morning to mid-day timeframe. Moderate
instability and modest shear (35 to 40 knots) will promote storm
organization. Very weak (~5.5 C/km) mid-level lapse rates amid a
moist profile, should mostly limit hail production. Therefore,
damaging wind gusts will likely be the primary threat. However, some
tornado threat will also exist as forecast soundings show strong
low-level curvature and significant streamwise vorticity in the
lowest 1km. There is some uncertainty with storm mode, but a tornado
threat would exist with either a broken line or a QLCS as it moves
across northern Indiana into southern Michigan and northwest Ohio. 

...Ozarks into the Mid-Mississippi Valley...
There is uncertainty across southern Missouri and northern Arkansas
regarding the strength of morning convection across the region. It
is unclear whether this morning convection will reintensify and move
east/northeast with a renewed threat, or if additional development
will occur during the afternoon and be the primary threat. However,
given the lack of strong low-level jet support, expect the overnight
MCS to be weakening by morning with the additional afternoon
development solution preferred. Moderate to potentially strong
instability is forecast by mid-afternoon with modest (25-30 knots)
of shear. This will support mostly multicell clusters with a threat
for damaging wind gusts. 

...Southern Plains...
Strong heating is forecast south of the boundary across the southern
Plains. This will result in moderate to potentially strong
instability amid 25-30 knots of shear. Very warm 700mb temperatures
(12C) will likely limit overall convective coverage. However,
forecast soundings show a mostly uncapped environment where a
surface boundary should be present. Therefore, at least isolated
storms are possible. Modest shear and very steep lapse rates will
support some hail/wind threat from any storms which can develop
within this region. 

...Northern Plains...
Despite generally limited low-level moisture, relatively steep lapse
rates and cool temperatures aloft may support a pocket of moderate
destabilization across parts of far northeast MT and ND into
northern MN Wednesday afternoon. Wind profiles will be relatively
weak and unidirectional, but a couple stronger cells or clusters
will be possible during the afternoon and evening, with localized
potential for hail and strong to severe gusts.

...Mid Atlantic...
Strong heating, combined with low 70s dewpoints will result in
moderate to strong instability in the Mid-Atlantic on Wednesday. 12Z
guidance has trended weaker with a belt of mid-level flow across the
Mid-Atlantic Wednesday afternoon/evening. However, sufficient
mid-level flow is still forecast for modest shear and some multicell
clusters. Damaging wind gusts will be the primary threat from these
scattered storms.

1140 AM CDT Tue Jun 17 2025

Valid 171700Z - 181200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR WESTERN NEW MEXICO AND FAR EASTERN
ARIZONA...

No significant changes in the previous forecast were needed.
Enhanced mid-level flow associated with an upper-level short wave
trough in conjunction with a deep/well-mixed boundary layer will
promote a broad fire weather threat across the Southwest through
today. Relative humidity at or below 10 percent and west winds of
20-25 mph atop dry fuels will support Critical fire weather
conditions across far eastern Arizona into western New Mexico and
Rio Grande Valley.

..Williams.. 06/17/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1256 AM CDT Tue Jun 17 2025/

...Synopsis...
A midlevel trough will move eastward from the Great Basin into the
central Rockies today. Within the base of the trough, a belt of
moderate deep-layer westerly flow will overspread the Southwest into
the southern Rockies. In response to the eastward-moving trough, a
lee cyclone will deepen over the central/southern High Plains, while
a southward-extending dryline sharpens over the southern High
Plains.

...Western NM and eastern AZ...
In the wake of poor overnight recoveries, strong diurnal
heating/mixing of a dry antecedent air mass west of the dryline will
yield widespread single-digit RH across much of AZ and NM during the
afternoon. Substantial boundary-layer mixing into the enhanced
deep-layer flow, coupled with a tightening pressure gradient
peripheral to the lee cyclone, will support 20-25 mph sustained
westerly surface winds amid the low RH and hot surface temperatures.
This combination will favor critical fire-weather conditions atop
dry fuels in western NM and far eastern AZ.

...THERE IS A MODERATE RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON
AND EVENING ACROSS PARTS OF SOUTHERN KANSAS AND NORTHERN OKLAHOMA...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms producing numerous to widespread damaging
winds, scattered large hail (isolated 2+ inches), and a few
tornadoes are expected this afternoon and evening across parts of
the central/southern Plains. The greatest threat for destructive
gusts up to 70-100 mph is forecast across portions of southern
Kansas and northern Oklahoma.

...KS/OK...
Overnight and morning thunderstorm activity has significantly
changed the overall forecast for severe storms across the central
Plains for today.  A severe MCS overspread parts of southeast KS and
northeast OK a few hours ago, pushing an outflow boundary southward
into central OK.  Strong heating is occurring to the north of this
boundary, where rapid destabilization is expected this afternoon
across northern OK/southern KS.  A consensus of 12z model guidance
shows this to be the corridor of rapid and intense thunderstorm
development.  Forecast soundings show substantial low-level shear,
steep lapse rates, and sufficient winds aloft for supercells capable
of very large hail and a few tornadoes.  Relatively warm
temperatures in the 850-700mb layer are a negative factor for a
greater tornado concern.  Through the evening, congealing outflows
will likely result in a larger MCS posing a risk of widespread
damaging wind gusts into northeast OK and perhaps parts of northwest
AR/southwest MO.

...Eastern CO/Southeast WY...
Overnight storms also impacted the forecast for this region today. 
Easterly low-level winds (enhanced by outflow) have transported
moisture westward into the foothills, where rapid thunderstorm
development is expected by early afternoon.  Steep mid-level lapse
rates and seasonably cool mid-level temperatures, coupled with
sufficiently strong westerly flow aloft, will promote a risk of very
large hail in the strongest storms.  A tornado or two is also
possible.  It is unclear how far east this activity can make it into
the adjacent Plains, where persistent low-clouds and more stable
conditions will likely prevail.  Refer to MCD #1330 for further
details.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0401 AM CDT Tue Jun 17 2025

Valid 201200Z - 251200Z

...DISCUSSION...
...D4/Friday...
A surface cyclone is forecast to deepen over the northern/central
High Plains on Friday, as a mid/upper-level trough shifts gradually
eastward across the western CONUS. Strong to extreme buoyancy will
develop by afternoon across parts of the central/northern Plains,
along/south of an effective warm front that will extend east of the
surface low. Much of the warm sector will likely remain capped, but
isolated storm development will be possible by late afternoon
near/north of the warm front, with increasing storm coverage during
the evening in response to a strengthening low-level jet. Supercells
will be possible initially, though the pattern suggests potential
for an MCS to develop and move eastward Friday night across the
upper Great Lakes vicinity. 

Guidance continues to vary substantially regarding the most favored
corridor for an organized severe threat. For example, the GFS/GEFS
is farther north across ND/northern MN, while the ECMWF/ECENS is
farther south across central MN/northern WI. Severe probabilities
will eventually be needed for this scenario, but confidence is the
favored corridor is too low for a 15% area.  

Strong to severe storms may also develop across the northern Rockies
and spread eastward across MT, in association with the approaching
mid/upper-level trough. Probabilities will likely be needed for this
scenario in future outlooks, though confidence is too low for a 15%
area at this time. 

...D5/Saturday...
A similar surface pattern is expected over the Great Plains and
upper Midwest on Saturday compared to D4/Friday. However, an
amplifying upper ridge may tend to suppress storm development
through much of the period. Some severe potential may again evolve
across MT along the northwest periphery of the ridge. There may also
be some potential for strong to severe storms along the northeast
periphery of the ridge into parts of the lower Great Lakes and New
England. 

...D6/Sunday - D8/Tuesday...
An upper-level ridge will remain prominent through the weekend into
early next week across parts of the central/eastern CONUS. Strong to
severe storms and possible MCS development could continue to occur
along the periphery of the ridge, but predictability becomes quite
low at this range regarding the details of any organized threat.

Tropical Storm Erick Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052025
300 AM CST Tue Jun 17 2025

Satellite imagery shows that the system is gradually becoming 
better organized.  TAFB determined a Dvorak data T-number of T2.5 
which is confirmed from a spiral banding measurement of roughly a 
0.5 wrap on enhanced IR images.  Therefore, the intensity estimate 
is set at 35 kt for this advisory, and the cyclone is being named.

Based on the latest center fixes, the motion remains 300/10 kt, as 
in the previous advisory.  A mid-level ridge to the north of the 
storm is forecast to weaken a bit by the global models, and this 
should result in a west-northwestward to northwestward motion at a 
slower forward speed.  The track guidance is in fairly good 
agreement and similar to the previous model runs.  It should 
be noted that the complexity of the track moving parallel to the 
coast of southern Mexico means that small changes in the system's 
heading will cause substantial differences in where and when the 
most significant wind impacts will occur.  The official track 
forecast is close to the various consensus solutions including the 
FSU Superensemble.  Users are reminded that the average 60-hour NHC 
track error is a little more than 60 n mi.

Erick is situated in an atmospheric and oceanic environment which 
appears to be very conducive for strengthening, with low shear, 
water temperatures near 29 deg C and mid-tropospheric humidities of 
75-80 percent.  The official intensity forecast is a little higher 
than the previous one, but some of the numerical guidance shows 
even more strengthening than that.  Moreover, the various Rapid 
Intensification (RI) indices show a significant chance for RI 
before landfall.  Thus, the NHC forecast for the peak strength of 
Erick could be conservative.

 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Erick is expected to strengthen significantly before 
reaching the coast of southern Mexico, where a Hurricane Watch is 
in effect.
 
2. Erick will likely produce heavy rainfall across portions of 
Central America and southern Mexico through this week. 
Life-threatening flooding and mudslides are possible, especially in
areas of steep terrain.
 
3. A storm surge could produce coastal flooding near where the 
center crosses the coast.

Potential Tropical Cyclone Five-E Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052025
300 PM CST Mon Jun 16 2025
 
Showers and thunderstorms associated with a broad area of low 
pressure located a couple of hundred miles south of the coast of 
Guatemala have increased in organization over the past couple of 
days.  Visible satellite imagery shows an exposed elongated 
low-level center south of a burst of modest convective activity.  
The initial intensity is set to 30 kt based on a partial overpass of 
satellite scatterometer data.  Since the system is expected to 
develop and affect southern Mexico late Wednesday or Thursday, 
advisories have been initiated on Potential Tropical Cyclone Five.

The initial motion is estimated to be 295/7 kt, but this is 
uncertain due to the lack of a defined core.  The low is moving 
along the western periphery of a ridge centered over the 
southwestern Atlantic, and this feature should control the motion of 
the system for the entirety of the forecast period.  Most global and 
regional models predict the low will turn toward the northwest later 
today or tonight, and that motion should persist for the next few 
days.  There is noticeable spread in the along-track speed of the 
system among the various models.  The GFS and some of the regional 
models show a slower motion while the ECMWF and HCCA anticipate a 
quicker forward speed.  The NHC forecast track lies closest to a 
blend of the GFS and the ECMWF, near the center of the guidance 
envelope.

The low should remain over an area of very warm waters and within a 
conducive environment for strengthening.  SHIPS-EC shows a 50 
percent chance of 55 kt of strengthening in 48 hr, which highlights 
the possibility of rapid intensification in the coming days.  The 
official forecast predicts the disturbance will become a tropical 
storm in about a day and a hurricane in a couple of days.  The NHC 
forecast lies near the higher end of the intensity guidance 
envelope.  This system is expected to bring significant winds upon 
landfall in southern Mexico in the next few days or so.  However, it 
is important to note that uncertainty remains high in the exact 
location of potential impacts, and interests in southern Mexico 
should closely monitor the latest forecasts.  

NHC now has the ability to issue tropical cyclone advisory products 
for Potential Tropical Cyclones up to 72 hours before the 
anticipated arrival of tropical-storm-force winds on land when 
confidence is high that there is a significant risk of wind or storm 
surge impacts to land, regardless of the immediate need for 
land-based hurricane or tropical storm watches or warnings,   
Previously, Potential Tropical Cyclone advisories could be issued up 
to 48 hours beforehand.   Appropriate watches and warnings will 
still be issued 48 and 36 hours, respectively, before the onset of 
tropical-storm-force winds.

KEY MESSAGES:

1. The disturbance is expected to become a tropical storm on Tuesday 
and quickly strengthen into a hurricane by Wednesday as it 
approaches southern Mexico.  Hurricane watches will likely be 
required for portions of southern Mexico tonight or early Tuesday.. 

2. The system will likely produce heavy rainfall across portions of 
Central America and southern Mexico through this week.  
Life-threatening flooding and mudslides are possible, especially in 
areas of steep terrain.

Mesoscale Discussion 1314
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0349 PM CDT Mon Jun 16 2025

Areas affected...east-central to northern MN

Concerning...Tornado Watch 423...

Valid 162049Z - 162215Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 423 continues.

SUMMARY...The severe threat should increase into early evening as
additional storms develop southward in central Minnesota and spread
east.

DISCUSSION...Initially low-topped convection has gradually deepened
over the past hour. Cells near the surface cyclone in west-central
MN have mainly had a brief tornado threat thus far. But an arcing
line of towering CU towards Willmar ahead of the surface cold front
suggests additional storms should form into the instability axis
characterized by moderate buoyancy with MLCAPE of 1500-2500 J/kg.
This activity should intensify into early evening and support a more
sustained severe threat beyond brief tornadoes. The overall severe
threat may peak into early evening with any sustained supercells
that can interact with residual outflow from storms that have spread
into west-central WI. MPX VWP data has sampled enhanced low-level
SRH near this outflow.

Mesoscale Discussion 1313
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0253 PM CDT Mon Jun 16 2025

Areas affected...Parts of southern Montana into far northern Wyoming

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 161953Z - 162200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Widely scattered storms are possible southern
Montana/northern Wyoming. Supercells capable of large hail and
severe winds are expected. Though timing is uncertain, a watch is
possible this afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Modestly moist upslope flow and an approaching
mid-level trough have promoted thunderstorm development within the
terrain of south-central Montana. This has occurred north of a band
of cirrus over much of Wyoming. While these storms have been slow to
intensify, continued surface heating this afternoon will increase
MLCAPE values to over 1000 J/kg. Effective shear of 45-55 kts will
help to organize convection into supercells capable of large hail
and severe wind gusts. Even with the approaching trough, mid-level
height falls will generally remain neutral until later in the
evening. It is not clear what storm coverage will be, but at least
widely scattered storms are possible with additional development
occurring in northern Wyoming near the Big Horns. Another point of
uncertainty is how far south/east activity will go given greater
inhibition underneath the cirrus canopy.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 423
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
255 PM CDT Mon Jun 16 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Central Minnesota
  Western Wisconsin

* Effective this Monday afternoon and evening from 255 PM until
  900 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A couple tornadoes possible
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2.5
    inches in diameter likely
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph likely

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms will intensify this afternoon near a cold
front sweeping eastward across the Minnesota, with a few supercells
expected.  Large hail is the main concern, but the strongest storms
may also pose a risk of damaging winds and a few tornadoes.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 70 statute miles
north and south of a line from 20 miles west of Alexandria MN to 80
miles northeast of Minneapolis MN. For a complete depiction of the
watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU3).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 2.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 60 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean
storm motion vector 27030.

Mesoscale Discussion 1304
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0349 PM CDT Sun Jun 15 2025

Areas affected...eastern Wyoming into eastern Colorado

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 152049Z - 152245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms expected to increase in coverage with
potential for large hail and damaging wind.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorm activity continues to increase, mainly
along and near the higher terrain/upslope regions, across the Front
Range into portions of eastern Wyoming. The downstream air mass
remains under the influence of strong MLCIN, albeit gradually
weakening along the western fringe. This weakening trend is set to
continue as forcing for ascent increases with a shortwave passage
this afternoon/evening. 

Thunderstorms are likely to form and quickly cluster this evening.
Once uncapped, the downstream air mass is moderately to very
unstable (with MLCAPE around 2000-3500 J/kg). Initially, supercells
capable of large hail and damaging wind will be the main threat
before a transition to linear bowing segments and focus for
potential damaging wind into portions of Nebraska. In the short
term, In addition, deepening cumulus is observed further east across
Cherry County in Nebraska. A supercell or two could emerge within
this region ahead of the main forcing. A watch will likely be needed
to cover these potential threats in the coming hours.

Mesoscale Discussion 1303
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0344 PM CDT Sun Jun 15 2025

Areas affected...Southeast Colorado into eastern New Mexico and far
West Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 152044Z - 152245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Large hail and severe wind gusts are possible with storms
that move off the terrain into southeast Colorado and eastern New
Mexico. A watch is not expected in the short term, but trends will
be monitored into the evening where a more organized wind threat
could evolve farther east.

DISCUSSION...Convection has developed from the Sangre de Cristo into
the southern Rockies this afternoon as moderately moist (mid 50s F
dewpoints) upslope flow has persisted over the last few hours. To
the east, a modifying outflow boundary from an earlier MCS in the
southern Plains has entered eastern New Mexico and should eventually
reach the terrain. While this outflow is slightly cooler, low 60s F
dewpoints have promoted 2000-2500 J/kg MLCAPE with weaker
inhibition. The expectation is for storms to eventually move off the
terrain as MLCIN is eroded in the next hour or two. Modestly
enhanced northwesterlies aloft on the western flank of the MCV atop
southeasterly surface winds supports 35-45 kts of effective shear
(stronger in the north and weaker south). Steep mid-level lapse
rates and strong shear should allow initial supercells to produce
large hail (up to 2.5 inches) as well as severe winds.

Some model guidance has suggested clustering is possible in
northeast New Mexico where stronger shear and greater buoyancy will
overlap. With only a weak low-level jet response in the Texas
Panhandle/South Plains this evening, it is not clear how far east
such a cluster/small MCS could propagate. A greater wind threat
would exist if this occurs. Overall, storm coverage should remain
isolated at least into early evening and a watch is not currently
expected. Trends in convective evolution will need to be monitored
into this evening, however.

Mesoscale Discussion 1302
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0213 PM CDT Sun Jun 15 2025

Areas affected...eastern Montana

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 151913Z - 152115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm development likely to increase over the next
couple of hours with initial supercells capable large to very large
hail and damaging wind.

DISCUSSION...Convective development has begun across the high
terrain in central Montana. This should increased in coverage as a
shortwave rotates out of Idaho into Montana this afternoon/evening
and forcing for ascent increases.

Initially, the moderately unstable and strongly sheared air mass
should support supercells. Given the steep lapse rates and linear
elongated hodographs, these will be capable of large to very large
hail (2-3+ in). Where east to southeasterly flow resides in
east-central/eastern Montana leading to sufficient low level SRH, a
tornado would be possible. 

Evolution through the afternoon should favor clustering and attempts
at upscale growth, to which the primary hazard will likely become
strong to significant damaging wind (some 60-75+ mph). A Severe
Thunderstorm Watch will be needed to cover this threat within the
next couple of hours.

Tropical Storm Dalila Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042025
200 PM MST Sun Jun 15 2025
 
Dalila's convection has collapsed, leaving behind a single
fragmented band of thunderstorms.  Subjective and objective
satellite estimates have lowered this cycle and the initial
intensity has been reduced to 40 kt based on a blend of the TAFB and
SAB Dvorak estimates. Dalila is expected to continue weakening as
the storm moves over cooler waters and into a hostile environment.
The NHC intensity forecast predicts Dalila to become a post-tropical
remnant low later today.
 
The storm is moving west-northwestward at 8 kt and should continue
gradually turning westward in the low-level flow. A more westward
motion is expected in the next day or two until the system
dissipates in a couple of days.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 418
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
215 PM MDT Sun Jun 15 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Central and eastern Montana
  North central Wyoming

* Effective this Sunday afternoon and evening from 215 PM until
  1100 PM MDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 80
    mph likely
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 3
    inches in diameter likely
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms are expected to increase in coverage and
intensity through the afternoon while spreading eastward from the
higher terrain.  The storm environment initially favors supercells
with very large hail (2-3 inch diameter), while upscale growth into
clusters is expected this evening with an increasing threat for
60-80 mph outflow winds.  Favorable storm interactions could also
support an isolated tornado or two this evening.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 100
statute miles north and south of a line from 30 miles west of
Harlowton MT to 10 miles east northeast of Baker MT. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU8).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
3 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 70 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 550. Mean storm motion vector
27020.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0752 AM CDT Sun Jun 15 2025

Valid 151300Z - 161200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE NORTHERN PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms capable of producing large to very
large hail and swaths of severe/damaging gusts (some 75+ mph) are
likely across portions of central/eastern Montana into northeast
Wyoming and the western Dakotas this afternoon through tonight.
Additional strong to severe thunderstorms may occur across the
central/southern Plains, and over parts of Virginia and North
Carolina.

...Northern/Central Plains...
Ongoing thunderstorms across northeast MT may pose an isolated hail
threat this morning. Otherwise, upper ridging will continue to
prevail over the Southwest and southern Rockies today, with a subtle
mid-level shortwave trough forecast to advance northeastward across
the northern Rockies and adjacent High Plains through the period.
This feature will likely aid in the development of initially
high-based convection over parts of the northern Rockies in MT by
early to mid afternoon. Meanwhile, diurnal heating of a fairly moist
low-level airmass (surface dewpoints generally in the mid to upper
50s) and steep mid-level lapse rates will foster around 2000-3000
J/kg of MLCAPE through the afternoon across much of central/eastern
MT along and south of a convectively reinforced boundary. Modest
low-level east-southeasterly flow will veer to west-southwesterly
and strengthen with height through mid/upper levels. This will
support around 40-50 kt of effective bulk shear and organized
convection.

Intense thunderstorm development appears increasingly likely across
central MT by mid to late afternoon, as large-scale ascent
associated with the shortwave trough overspreads the surface warm
sector. Given the rather favorable thermodynamic/kinematic
environment expected, initial convection will likely be
supercellular and pose a threat for large to very large hail
potentially up to 2-3 inches in diameter. The Enhanced Risk has been
expanded westward some in central MT to account for this expected
supercell development, and a 30% area has been included for large
hail as well. With time this evening, one or more clusters will
likely evolve from the initially discrete activity across eastern MT
into parts of northeast WY and the western Dakotas. Steepened
low-level lapse rates should aid in efficient mixing of intense
downdraft winds to the surface, and swaths of severe/damaging winds
should occur as thunderstorms spread eastward through the evening
and into early Monday morning. Some of these winds may be
significant, with peak gusts potentially reaching up to 70-80 mph on
an isolated basis.

Isolated to scattered high-based thunderstorms should develop along
the surface trough/dryline within a moist low-level upslope flow
regime across portions of southeast WY into eastern CO, and perhaps
persisting into western NE/KS. This activity will pose a risk of
strong to severe outflow winds given a deeply mixed boundary layer
and the presence of very steep low-level lapse rates. Isolated hail
may also occur where any robust updrafts can be maintained within a
modestly sheared environment.

...Southern Plains...
Extensive, loosely organized convection is ongoing this morning
across much of western/southern OK and vicinity. This activity is
being aided by modest low-level warm moist advection associated with
a 20-30 kt southwesterly low-level jet. Current expectations are for
these thunderstorms to generally weaken through the rest of the
morning as the low-level jet gradually weakens. Even so, an isolated
threat for strong/gusty winds may persist with these clusters as
they spread generally south-southeastward. There may be some chance
for either this morning convection or related outflow to regenerate
new, robust convection this afternoon across parts of TX. Have
expanded the Marginal Risk for wind southward a bit to account for
this potential, but in general weak shear should limit convective
organization with southward extent. Otherwise, an isolated severe
threat may exist with convection that develops across AR this
afternoon in proximity to a remnant MCV, and along/east of the
surface lee trough/dryline across the southern High Plains.

...Virginia/North Carolina...
A low-amplitude mid-level shortwave trough will move eastward across
the central/southern Appalachians today. A related weak surface low
should develop eastward near the NC/VA border through the afternoon.
A moist and unstable airmass will likely be in place across much of
NC and southern VA as filtered daytime heating occurs. Poor lapse
rates aloft and modest deep-layer shear should limit the overall
severe potential across this region. Still, isolated wet microbursts
and/or marginally severe hail may occur with the stronger
updrafts/cores that can develop this afternoon and early evening.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM MST (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Dalila was 
located near latitude 18.1 North, longitude 107.4 West. Dalila is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h). This general 
motion is expected during the next couple days, as Dalila moves 
farther away from the southwestern coast of Mexico.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 60 mph (95 km/h) with 
higher gusts. Steady weakening is forecast during the next couple of 
days, with the system becoming a post-tropical remnant low tonight 
or Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 996 mb (29.42 inches).

Tropical Storm Dalila Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042025
200 AM MST Sun Jun 15 2025
 
Dalila is likely near its peak intensity, with little change in
organization evident since the previous advisory package. The latest
subjective Dvorak intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB were 65
knots and 55 knots, respectively. Objective estimates ranged from
45 to 57 knots, while an ASCAT pass earlier in the day showed
numerous 50 knot wind barbs. Based on a blend of these data, the
initial intensity for this advisory has been held at 55 knots.
 
Dalila is now heading toward the west-northwest, or 285/12 knots. A
turn toward the west is expected during the next day or so, as 
Dalila is steered by a mid-level ridge over northern Mexico and the 
southwest U.S. A westward to slightly south of due west motion is 
then forecast through dissipation as Dalila moves over much
cooler waters. The current forecast shows Dalila becoming a
post-tropical remnant low in a day or so, and dissipating by 
Tuesday. The latest track forecast is very close to that of the 
previous advisory, and is close to the track consensus aids.

Dalila should begin to weaken later today as some drier mid-level
air evident in water vapor imagery begins to impact the system.  
More steady weakening is then likely as the system moves
over much cooler water and into a progressively drier mid-level
environment. The latest intensity forecast is close to the previous
advisory and in good agreement with the intensity consensus
guidance.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. The outer bands of Tropical Storm Dalila will bring locally heavy 
rainfall to the Mexican states of Michoacán and Guerrero through 
this morning. Scattered areas of flooding and mudslides are 
expected, especially in areas of steep terrain near the coast.
 
2. Dalila is expected to produce tropical-storm-force winds across
portions of the warning area during the next few hours.  Winds 
will diminish today while the system moves farther offshore of the 
coast of southwestern Mexico.
