Day 1 Convective Outlook

Valid 050100Z - 051200Z

...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms are not forecast the rest of tonight.

...01z Update...

Midlevel speed max is translating quickly off the middle Atlantic
Coast early this evening. Large-scale ascent and associated buoyancy
have progressed well offshore and thunderstorms are no longer
forecast over the southern Appalachians.

Upstream across the Pacific Northwest, poor lapse rates within the
warm conveyor do not appear favorable for more than a rogue flash of
lightning within the deepest updrafts. For this reason have lowered
thunder probabilities to less than 10%.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0415 PM CST Mon Dec 04 2023

Valid 061200Z - 121200Z

Some increase in fire weather conditions is expected across the
southern High Plains late this week and into the weekend as a series
of mid-level shortwaves traverse the Central Rockies and Southwest.
This will lead to several days of lee troughing and strengthening
winds and downslope flow in the region. The driest and windiest
conditions are likely on Friday as the trough deepens and stronger
mid-level flow overspreads the region. Freeze cured fine fuels will
likely support some increase in initial attack, but ERC values near
seasonal norm should mitigate a greater threat for large fire.
Therefore, Elevated fire weather conditions are possible, but
Critical fire weather conditions remain unlikely and therefore, no
probabilities are warranted at this time. 

Some precipitation may fall in this region on Saturday which would
limit fuel receptiveness, but where fuels remain dry, especially
across Far West Texas and southern New Mexico, dry and breezy
conditions will continue to dry fuels which may eventually lead to
fire weather concerns in the region.

Valid 051200Z - 061200Z

...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms are not expected across the contiguous United States
on Tuesday.

...Synopsis...
A large-scale trough will shift gradually eastward across the
eastern half of the CONUS, while a midlevel jet streak moves into
the base of the trough. Ascent in the left exit region of the jet
streak will promote scattered showers across parts of the Ohio
Valley, though buoyancy will remain too shallow to support
thunderstorms. As large-scale ascent preceding the midlevel trough
overspreads the Eastern Seaboard late in the period, a surface low
will develop northward off the North Carolina coast. However, any
thunderstorm potential associated with this feature should remain
offshore where buoyancy will be maximized atop the Gulf Stream.
Farther west, a midlevel trough will approach the northwestern
CONUS, though boundary-layer moisture/instability supportive of
thunderstorms will remain offshore.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No changes. See previous discussion below.

..Bentley.. 12/04/2023

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1151 PM CST Sun Dec 03 2023/

...Synopsis...
High pressure will be the dominant weather feature across the
central and western US on Monday, with a dry cold frontal passage
bringing cooler temperatures across much of the Plains. Weakening
westerly gradients will give way to lighter southerly winds, with
higher afternoon relative humidity across the central and southern
Plains. As such, fire weather concerns will remain low on Monday.

Building high pressure across the Great Basin will lead to offshore
flow across portions of Southern California Monday into Tuesday.
Localized elevated fire weather conditions will be possible where
fuels are the driest across the foothills in Santa Barbara and
Ventura counties.

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected through tonight.

...KY and Vicinity...
A compact and fast-moving shortwave trough currently over western KY
will track eastward through the day into the central Appalachians. 
This system resulted in a period of thunderstorm activity several
hours ago over MO/IL, and could continue to result in scattered
lightning flashes for a few more hours into this afternoon.  No
severe storms are expected.

Elsewhere, isolated lightning flashes are possible in a strong
onshore flow regime along the coast of northwest WA.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0654 AM CST Mon Dec 04 2023

Valid 041300Z - 051200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected through tonight.

...Synopsis/Discussion...
In mid/upper levels, mean troughing will be maintained over the
east-central CONUS as one strong shortwave trough effectively is
replaced by the next upstream.  The leading perturbation -- located
over the STL vicinity -- is supporting an area of large-scale ascent
in the form of both DCVA and a warm-advection conveyor.  In turn, an
arc of precip with embedded showers and isolated/episodic
thunderstorms is apparent just ahead of the trough.  Meager yet
sufficient moisture above the boundary layer, and cooling aloft,
will continue to support elevated MUCAPE up to about 200 J/kg,
sporadically extending into icing layers suitable for lightning
generation.  The most probable corridor for related, isolated
thunder potential will be into midday from parts of the lower Ohio
Valley toward the southern Appalachians.  

After that, the causative perturbation will weaken and move out to
the Atlantic.  Another, similarly evolving shortwave trough --
evident in moisture-channel imagery over portions of southern SK and
eastern MT -- should dig southeastward and strengthen through the
period.  This feature should reach the Mid-South and southern parts
of the Mid Mississippi Valley by 12Z tomorrow, on a similar but
slightly more southerly track relative to the leading shortwave. 
However, forecast soundings suggest even weaker moisture, coupled
with more stable lapse rates in typical lightning-generation layers,
rendering thunder potential (if any) too isolated and uncertain for
an outlook area.  

Isolated lightning has been noted in a baroclinic-leaf pattern
preceding a cyclone over the northeast Pacific (well west of the
Pacific Northwest).  Weakly favorable low/middle-level moistening
and destabilization in the related warm-advection plume may reach
portions of the Olympic Peninsula late afternoon into evening, as
the ridge aloft moves away.  Elsewhere, boundary-layer drying/
stabilization from prior frontal passages (from the Plains eastward)
and progressive, strong, synoptic-scale ridging aloft (across the
West) will preclude thunderstorms.
