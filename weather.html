Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0700 AM CST Tue Jan 23 2024

Valid 231300Z - 241200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM SOUTH TEXAS
NORTHEASTWARD ACROSS THE COASTAL PLAIN TO WESTERN LOUISIANA...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated strong to severe thunderstorms will be possible today and
tonight from south Texas into western Louisiana.

...South Texas and the Coastal Plain into western Louisiana...
Showers and scattered/elevated thunderstorms are ongoing this
morning across Texas, in tandem with a southwesterly mid-level jet
that will continue advancing northeastward out of Mexico across the
southern Plains through tonight.  Instability remains weak, and
generally elevated atop a cool/still-stable boundary layer, with
small hail locally approaching severe levels possible, as waves of
convection spread across the area.

Nearer the coast, as a very weak surface low develops over east
Texas today, some inland advection of more moist gulf air will
continue, with potential that a few near-surface-based storms
eventually evolve this afternoon.  This convection could pose local
risk for gusty/damaging winds, and possibly a brief/weak tornado or
two, though modest CAPE/weak lapse rates will limit severe potential
despite favorably strong/veering flow with height.  Some risk for
gusty winds should eventually spread into parts of western
Louisiana, though severe potential will remain low through the end
of the period.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0354 PM CST Mon Jan 22 2024

Valid 241200Z - 301200Z

Fire concerns will be limited for the extended forecast period.
Fuels are wet across the CONUS and additional wetting rain is
expected for much of the CONUS this week. The only dry regions will
be the northern Rockies/northern Plains where extensive snowcover is
present with below freezing temperatures.

Valid 222000Z - 231200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected.

...20Z Update...
Minor changes have been made to the general thunderstorm area, but
otherwise the previous outlook reasoning remains valid. See the
previous discussion below for more details. A few stronger storms
are possible this afternoon/evening near the upper TX coast, and
perhaps late tonight near the Edwards Plateau region, but the severe
threat still appears limited through the end of the period.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1036 AM CST Mon Jan 22 2024/

...South-central CONUS including coastal Texas...
Surface high pressure and cold stable conditions will exist over the
eastern half of the CONUS, but multiple low-amplitude mid-level
disturbances and a prevalent warm conveyor over the south-central
CONUS toward the Ozarks/Midwest will influence widespread showers
across that same region with continued elevated thunderstorm
potential especially across east/southeast Texas toward Louisiana
and the ArkLaTex. 

Weak surface-based destabilization should gradually occur near the
upper Texas coast, beginning this afternoon and more so tonight.
Within a favorable kinematic environment, a few stronger
near-surface-based storms could occur as early as this afternoon
across the upper Texas coast, but the overall severe thunderstorm
potential is still expected to remain low through tonight.

...Western States...
Showers and occasional lightning flashes will be possible from
portions of southwest Oregon and California into southern Arizona.
This convection will be associated with a pronounced mid-level
trough embedded within broader cyclonic flow, with steepening lapse
rates.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1022 PM CST Sun Jan 21 2024/

...Synopsis...
A trough will remain in place across the western/central US with
continued cool and moist conditions extending into the eastern US by
late Tuesday. Given the cool and moist conditions across these
regions, along with snow pack in place across the northern US,
wildfire spread potential will remain low on Tuesday.

Mesoscale Discussion 0083
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0917 AM CST Mon Jan 22 2024

Areas affected...portions of eastern/northeastern IL...northern
IN...far southern MI and far northwest OH

Concerning...Freezing rain 

Valid 221517Z - 221915Z

SUMMARY...Light to moderate freezing rain is expected through the
morning hours with rates of 0.01-0.03 in/hr possible. Some
mixed-phase precipitation is also possible early.

DISCUSSION...As of 15 UTC, regional radar mosaic imagery and surface
observations showed a broad area of light to moderate wintry
precipitation across parts of northeastern IL. Over the last hour,
automated reports of unknown precipitation type and freezing rain
have gradually become more numerous as the precipitation has
expanded over an air mass with surface temperatures in the mid to
upper 20s F. Driven primarily by low-level warm advection, light to
moderate precipitation is expected to continue to move
east/northeast this morning. Light snow has been observed across
parts of southwest lower MI and northwest IN. However, observed and
modified model soundings show an elevated warm nose of 1-2 C between
1-2 km AGL will gradually advect northeastward over the next few
hours. While some snow and sleet are possible ahead of the main area
of precipitation, gradually deepening of the elevated warm layer to
near 600-800 m will favor a transition to predominately freezing
rain.

Rain rates of 0.01-0.03 in/hr are possible above favorable surface
temperatures for rapid ice accretion. The most likely corridor for
impactful freezing rain appears to be from northeastern IL into
northwest IN and far southwest lower MI through this morning. Hi-res
CAM guidance has been poor thus far in handling the evolution of the
precipitation field. While low-level warm advection may wane
slightly through the day, observed low and mid-level ascent appears
strong enough to continue to support precipitation into the early
afternoon. Given the cold surface temperatures and melting layer
aloft, freezing rain appears likely.

..Bentley.. 01/22/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1020 PM CST Sun Jan 21 2024/

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns are expected to remain low today. Much of the
northern US remains under snow pack with cool and moist conditions
to continue across the western and central US. Recent
precipitation over the last 7-14 days has resulted in high fuel
moisture across much of the CONUS, further limiting potential for
wildfire spread.
