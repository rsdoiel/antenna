Mesoscale Discussion 1476
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0350 PM CDT Fri Jun 27 2025

Areas affected...Far eastern KY into WV...western/southern VA...NC

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 272050Z - 272245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated damaging winds are possible into early evening.

DISCUSSION...Storms have increased in coverage and intensity over
the last hour across parts of NC, and also from eastern KY into WV.
Deep-layer shear is weak across the region, but buoyancy is strong,
with MLCAPE of 2000-3000 J/kg along the western/southern periphery
of an extensive cloud shield over the Mid Atlantic. 

Relatively large PW and steep low-level lapse rates will support a
risk of localized downbursts with the strongest storms. Some outflow
consolidation is possible with time, if a sufficient concentration
of storms can develop. This could lead to a somewhat greater chance
for damaging wind, though this scenario remains uncertain.

Mesoscale Discussion 1475
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0336 PM CDT Fri Jun 27 2025

Areas affected...western/central ND

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 272036Z - 272230Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...Initial thunderstorms may develop over the next couple
hours, with greater storm coverage by early evening. Very large to
giant hail will be possible with the most intense supercell or two,
along with tornado and severe wind threats. Watch issuance is
expected with moderate uncertainty on timing.

DISCUSSION...A focused corridor of supercell development is
anticipated this evening, perhaps as early as 22-23Z along a weak
surface trough/front in western ND. More probable storm development
is anticipated towards sunset, within the exit region of a
strengthening low-level jet over SD/NE. The initially subtle/weak
forcing for ascent lends some uncertainty to sustained storm
timing/location. But once storms are sustained, weak low-level winds
veering to moderate mid-level and stronger upper-level westerlies
will yield a favorable hodograph for splitting supercell structures.
In conjunction with very steep mid-level lapse rates with southern
extent (as sampled by the 18Z UNR sounding) and ample buoyancy, this
type of pattern should favor a risk for baseball to softball-size
hail in a supercell or two before storms congeal into an MCS
tonight. This seems most probable across central ND this evening.

Mesoscale Discussion 1474
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0303 PM CDT Fri Jun 27 2025

Areas affected...Southern/eastern Lower MI into northeast IN and
northwest OH

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 466...

Valid 272003Z - 272130Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 466
continues.

SUMMARY...Damaging winds remain possible through late afternoon.

DISCUSSION...A line of storms has developed this afternoon from
southern lower MI into northern IN. Weak midlevel lapse rates and
modest deep-layer shear have limited storm organization, with the
strongest measured gusts thus far in the 40-45 kt range. However,
moderate southwesterly flow above the surface (as noted in regional
VWPs) has resulted in relatively fast moving outflows and storm
motions, and may continue to support a threat for damaging strong to
locally severe gusts through the remainder of the afternoon. 

The ongoing small cluster east of Lansing may pose the greatest
short-term threat, given its favorable north-south orientation and
somewhat stronger deep-layer flow/shear with northern extent. Some
intensification and/or redevelopment remains possible farther south
within a moderately unstable environment into far southern Lower MI,
northeast IN, and northwest OH.

Mesoscale Discussion 1473
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0245 PM CDT Fri Jun 27 2025

Areas affected...western NE into southern SD

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 271945Z - 272145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Increasing, outflow-dominated convection should yield a
threat for severe gusts along with isolated severe hail. Severe
thunderstorm watch issuance is possible.

DISCUSSION...High-based convection is increasing along the dryline
across the NE Panhandle into far northeast CO. This activity is
likely to persist as storm-scale convective outflows are generated
within an initially weak deep-layer shear environment. As outflows
impinge on progressively greater buoyancy into central NE and
south-central SD, a threat for severe gusts may persist over the
next several hours. Development ahead of dryline-forced convection
is not anticipated in the near-term owing to persistent
warm/moist-sector MLCIN, and this may curtail a greater hail threat.

Mesoscale Discussion 1472
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0225 PM CDT Fri Jun 27 2025

Areas affected...central to eastern MT

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 271925Z - 272130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Sporadic severe gusts and small hail will be possible with
high-based thunderstorms moving east from central to eastern Montana
into early evening. Lack of greater organization/intensity should
preclude severe-storm watch issuance.

DISCUSSION...A minor perturbation embedded within a moderate
westerly mid-level flow regime has aided in gradually increasing
convection across central MT. Much of central/eastern MT has only
scant to meager buoyancy per 18Z TFX sounding and 19Z mesoanalysis,
with mid 50s or greater surface dew points confined to the far
eastern portion of the state. Still, typical inverted-v
thermodynamic profiles in conjunction with moderate mid-level
westerlies should aid in easterly progressive storms with a threat
for isolated severe gusts.

Mesoscale Discussion 1471
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0213 PM CDT Fri Jun 27 2025

Areas affected...Parts of central/eastern KY...middle and eastern
TN...northern AL...extreme northwest GA

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 271913Z - 272115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Localized damaging wind is possible this afternoon.

DISCUSSION...One cluster of storms is ongoing across parts of middle
TN into northern AL, with another across central KY. Deep-layer
shear is quite weak across the region, but some outflow
consolidation has been noted with both clusters. Additional storm
development will be possible along and to the immediate cool side of
these outflows with time. 

Seasonably cool temperatures aloft atop a very warm and moist
boundary layer are resulting in MLCAPE of 3000-4000 J/kg in areas
not already influenced by convective outflow. This very favorable
buoyancy could lead to additional vigorous updrafts, which in turn
could pose a threat of localized downbursts and small to near-severe
hail through the remainder of the afternoon.

Mesoscale Discussion 1459
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0331 PM CDT Thu Jun 26 2025

Areas affected...Parts of central/eastern IA

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 465...

Valid 262031Z - 262200Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 465
continues.

SUMMARY...The threat for damaging wind and possibly a tornado will
continue through late afternoon.

DISCUSSION...A convective line has evolved across central into
northern IA this afternoon, with other smaller clusters gradually
becoming better organized into southwest IA. Deep-layer shear is
rather weak, and weakens with southward extent, but unidirectional
25-35 kt southwest flow in the 1-3 km AGL layer (as noted in the
KDMX VWP) could support some organized damaging-wind potential. 

There has been some tendency for outflow to advance ahead of the
convective line, but any small bowing segments that become oriented
more orthogonal to the southwesterly low/midlevel flow (such as the
one across Butler/Grundy Counties, IA) could be more likely to
produce localized swaths of wind damage through late afternoon.
Modestly favorable effective SRH could also support a brief tornado
threat.

Mesoscale Discussion 1458
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0243 PM CDT Thu Jun 26 2025

Areas affected...Parts of extreme northeast IA...southeast
MN...southwest WI

Concerning...Tornado Watch 463...

Valid 261943Z - 262115Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 463 continues.

SUMMARY...Both an eastward-moving convective line and developing
cells ahead of the line could pose a tornado threat this afternoon.
Localized damaging wind is also possible.

DISCUSSION...A broken line of storms has developed from southeast MN
into north-central IA, with additional cells gradually developing
east of the line into parts of southwest WI. MLCAPE has increased
into the 1000-1500 J/kg along and immediately north of the warm
front, with a more stable environment farther north, where clouds
have persisted and temperatures are in the 60s F. 

The broken line moving across far southeast MN earlier produced a
reported tornado in Freeborn County, and this portion of the line
will continue to pose a tornado threat as it traverses the warm
frontal zone, where low-level shear/SRH is locally enhanced (as
noted in the KARX VWP). The developing cells east of the line could
also begin to pose a tornado threat, especially if one or more of
these cells can mature and take on more of a front-parallel motion,
leading to increased residence time in the frontal zone. Cell
mergers into the primary line could also result in locally increased
tornado potential. 

Aside from the tornado potential, locally damaging wind will
continue to be possible with the primary convective line as it moves
eastward this afternoon.

Mesoscale Discussion 1457
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0211 PM CDT Thu Jun 26 2025

Areas affected...portions of far northern Texas...western
Oklahoma...into far southern Kansas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 261911Z - 262115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Storms with potential for strong to severe wind possible
this afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorm development is ongoing across far western
Oklahoma this afternoon where daytime heating has allowed MLCIN to
erode. Temperatures are now in the mid 80s to mid 90s with dew
points in the upper 60s to 70s. MLCAPE around 1000-2000 J/kg is
noted in surface objective analysis. Though the background flow is
generally weak, steep lapse rates around 8-8.5 C/km and moist
profiles will support a few strong storms capable of strong to
severe winds through the afternoon. Given the lack of shear for a
more widespread and organized threat, a watch is unlikely to be
needed.

DISCUSSION...Extensive convection is ongoing late this afternoon
across parts of eastern NC, with additional storms in western NC,
and developing cumulus into parts of SC and east-central/northeast
GA. Additional storm development is possible into early evening,
within a very unstable (MLCAPE of 3000-4000 J/kg) environment.
Generally weak deep-layer shear continue to hamper storm
organization, but the strong instability and steep midlevel lapse
rates will continue to support vigorous updrafts. 

Outflow is gradually expanding across eastern NC, and there may be
some tendency for a loosely organized storm cluster to propagate
south/southwestward with time, as outflow impinges upon a hot and
very moist environment. A similar evolution could take place with
ongoing storms across western NC. This could lead to more
concentrated areas of damaging wind with time. The strongest
updrafts will also continue to be capable of producing isolated
hail.

Mesoscale Discussion 1438
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0258 PM CDT Wed Jun 25 2025

Areas affected...FL Panhandle into south GA and far southeast AL

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 251958Z - 252200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Additional storm development is possible through late
afternoon, with a continued threat of damaging wind and isolated
hail.

DISCUSSION...Widely scattered storms are ongoing this afternoon
across the FL Panhandle into southwest GA, with additional cumulus
development noted northeast of the ongoing convection. Relatively
steep lapse rates and cool temperatures aloft are supporting strong
to extreme buoyancy, with MLCAPE generally in the 3000-4000 J/kg
range. Deep-layer flow is rather weak, though modest midlevel
northeasterlies on the periphery of an upper ridge will support
20-25 kt of effective shear through the afternoon, which may support
modest storm organization given the very favorable instability. 

Potential will continue this afternoon for southwestward moving
clusters capable of damaging downburst/outflow winds and isolated
hail. There is some potential for loosely organized outflow-driven
clusters to develop, which could produce more concentrated areas of
wind damage, though this scenario remains somewhat uncertain. 

Uncertainty regarding severe coverage renders the need for
short-term watch issuance uncertain, but trends will be monitored
for an uptick in coverage through the remainder of the afternoon.

Mesoscale Discussion 1437
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0216 PM CDT Wed Jun 25 2025

Areas affected...central and northeastern Nebraska...parts of
southeastern South Dakota and northwestern Iowa

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 251916Z - 252115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...A corridor of increasing thunderstorm development,
including gradually organizing clusters with increasing potential
for strong to severe surface gusts, through 4-6 PM CDT.

DISCUSSION...In the wake of one low-amplitude short-wavelength
perturbation migrating through the Upper Midwest toward adjacent
Great Lakes vicinity, a similar strength perturbation is gradually
migrating north-northeastward through the central high plains,
around the northwestern periphery of the prominent mid-level ridge
centered over the Tennessee Valley.  Downstream of this feature,
forcing for ascent has maintained an arcing band of precipitation
across Nebraska, which is preceded by a seasonably high moisture
content boundary-layer that is destabilizing beneath relatively warm
and dry layers aloft associated with the ridging.

Within the strengthening zone of differential surface heating to the
east of the precipitation band, mixed-layer CAPE is beginning to
increase in excess of 2000 J/kg, beneath a modest belt of
southwesterly mid-level flow which includes speeds of 30-40 kt in
the 700-500 mb layer.  Although mid/upper-level lapse rates are
weak, as low-level lapse rates continue to steepen and inhibition
erodes further, a corridor of increasing thunderstorm development
appears probable across Nebraska, from the Lexington NE toward Sioux
City IA vicinity, through 21-23Z.  As this occurs, heavy
precipitation loading and evaporative cooling in downdrafts may
gradually contribute to downward momentum transfer accompanied by
increasing potential for a few strong to severe severe gusts, in
slowly organizing clusters.

Mesoscale Discussion 1429
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0349 PM CDT Tue Jun 24 2025

Areas affected...portions of extreme northwest Pennsylvania into
extreme western New York

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 242049Z - 242315Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...A couple of damaging gusts cannot be ruled out over the
next several hours. A Severe Thunderstorm Watch is not expected.

DISCUSSION...A few thunderstorms have initiated and intensified off
of surface boundaries and confluence zones over the past couple of
hours. Deep-layer flow and shear, as well as buoyancy, are modest at
best across the region (e.g. 1000 J/kg MLCAPE amid less than 20 kts
of effective bulk shear). As such, a couple of brief downbursts may
cause sparse tree damage in the near-term. Relatively more robust
storms are currently tracking across extreme southeast Ontario.
These storms may cross Lake Erie a few hours for now, perhaps with a
slightly greater damaging gust threat. Nonetheless, the severe
threat should remain localized, precluding the need for a Severe
Thunderstorm Watch.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 458
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
105 PM MDT Tue Jun 24 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Northeast Colorado

* Effective this Tuesday afternoon and evening from 105 PM until
  800 PM MDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail likely with isolated very large hail events
    to 2.5 inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms will develop northeastward out of the
foothills into the adjacent Plains this afternoon.  A few intense
storms capable of large hail and damaging winds are expected.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 40
statute miles east and west of a line from 60 miles north northwest
of Akron CO to 30 miles southeast of Colorado Springs CO. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU8).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
24025.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0247 PM CDT Tue Jun 24 2025

Valid 261200Z - 021200Z

...Synopsis...
An weak upper-level trough will move across the Pacific Northwest 
Day 3/Thursday into the Great Lakes by Day 7/Monday. An amplifying
ridge across the Intermountain West early next week will promote
lighter surface winds but well above normal temperatures for much of
the Western U.S. Weak troughing will remain off the West Coast, with
potential for locally breezy conditions and mix of wet/dry
thunderstorms.

...Day 3-6/Thursday-Sunday...
Generally weak upper flow with the western trough will promote
lighter, mainly terrain driven winds across much of the
Intermountain West and Southwest late this week, into early next
week. A few hours of Elevated to locally Critical conditions will be
possible across portions of the Columbia Basin into the Snake River
Plain in Idaho on D3/Thursday and D4/Friday.

...Day 7/Monday - Day 8/Tuesday...
A weak trough will push the western ridge eastward across the Divide
and Rockies early next week. There is some potential for increasing 
winds but also moisture for thunderstorms across the Pacific
Northwest. For now, confidence in moisture and position of the
trough remains too low to include probabilities.

Mesoscale Discussion 1420
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0336 PM CDT Mon Jun 23 2025

Areas affected...parts of southern/eastern Wisconsin

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 455...

Valid 232036Z - 232230Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 455
continues.

SUMMARY...Another small, organized cluster of storms posing a risk
for damaging wind gusts may evolve east of La Crosse toward the
Oshkosh vicinity through 5-7 PM CDT, along outflow trailing the lead
cluster now spreading south through southeast of Green Bay.

DISCUSSION...One small, organized convective cluster, with an
embedded meso-beta scale cyclonic circulation, has already evolved
and produced a narrow corridor of severe and/or damaging gusts near
and east of the Wisconsin Rapids area.  This may continue near/south
and southeast of the Green Bay vicinity, before diminishing while
spreading into Lake Michigan within the next hour or so.

Meanwhile, thunderstorm activity now forming upstream may undergo a
similar evolution along the trailing outflow from the lead cluster, 
east of La Crosse toward the Oshkosh vicinity during the next couple
of hours. Inhibition has become increasingly negligible in the
presence of peak heating, with latest mesoanalysis indicating CAPE
on the order of 2000-3000 J/kg, in the presence of at least modest
shear beneath 40+ kt westerly 500 mb flow.

Mesoscale Discussion 1418
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0308 PM CDT Mon Jun 23 2025

Areas affected...parts of northwestern Maine

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 232008Z - 232245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Widely scattered strong to severe storms, including a
supercell or two, may cross the St. Lawrence Valley and at least
approach parts of northwestern Maine prior to 8 PM EDT, accompanied
by the risk for large hail and potential for a tornado.  Although it
still appears unlikely that a severe weather watch will be needed,
trends will continue to be monitored for this possibility.

DISCUSSION...Near/just ahead of a mid-level perturbation associated
with a now dissipated thunderstorm cluster, isolated supercell
development appears underway across parts of southeastern Quebec,
roughly 100 miles or so to the northwest of Quebec City.  Activity
appears to be forming just to the south of a warm frontal zone,
where surface dew points are near 70 F, and low-level hodographs
have become sizable beneath 30 kt west-southwesterly flow around 850
mb.

This is occurring beneath 40-50 kt west-northwesterly 500 mb flow,
around the northeastern periphery of the prominent mid-level high
centered near the southern Appalachians, contributing to a
southeastward propagation toward the St. Lawrence Valley, near
Quebec City.  Additional thunderstorm development appears possible
over the next few hours in closer proximity to the frontal zone to
the north.  

East of the St. Lawrence Valley, into northern New England, warming
and moistening of the boundary layer is ongoing along and south of
the northward developing warm frontal zone.  Forecast soundings from
the Rapid Refresh suggest that this may include surface dew points
increasing to near or above 70 F, in the presence of enlarging,
clockwise-curved low-level hodographs, across parts of northwestern
Maine prior to 00Z.  Although the onset of nightfall contributes to
some uncertainty concerning the extent of boundary-layer
destabilization, there appears at least some potential for the
maintenance of supercells posing a risk for severe hail, and
potential for a tornado or two.

Mesoscale Discussion 1417
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0234 PM CDT Mon Jun 23 2025

Areas affected...portions of central Kansas into far southeast
Nebraska and southwestern Iowa

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 231934Z - 232200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Some increase in severe potential may occur if more robust
thunderstorm development can take place along the cold front. Strong
to potentially severe wind gusts would be the main hazard.
Convective trends are being monitored for the need of a Severe
Thunderstorm Watch issuance.

DISCUSSION...A line of thunderstorms has developed across eastern NE
in a post-cold-frontal regime. Within the last hour, convection has
tried to deepen along the KS/NE border, closer to the cold front,
and where greater buoyancy resides. Deep-layer shear is modest at
best (e.g. 30 kts), and is lagging the cold front. While vertical
wind shear is limited, 7-8 C/km boundary-layer lapse rates atop 70+
F surface dewpoints is contributing to 3000 J/kg MLCAPE in a weakly
capped environment. While storms should be mainly pulse-cellular or
multicellular, any cold-pool mergers that occur with the more
intense storms may support strong to severe gusts. Convective trends
are being monitored for further increases in coverage or intensity
that would warrant a Severe Thunderstorm Watch issuance.

0259 PM CDT Sun Jun 22 2025

Areas affected...southwest to northeast NE and southeast SD

Concerning...Severe potential...Severe Thunderstorm Watch likely 

Valid 221959Z - 222200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...Severe wind/hail threats will increase as a corridor of
scattered thunderstorms form ahead of a dryline, along a slow-moving
to quasi-stationary front. A Severe Thunderstorm Watch issuance is
expected.

DISCUSSION...Cumulus development is underway along the slow-moving
to quasi-stationary front that arcs across southeast SD into
southwest NE, ahead of a dryline that has mixed across northwest KS
and far southwest NE. Initial storm development should occur ahead
of the dryline/front intersection into central NE where MLCIN is
minimized, with additional storms rippling north-northeast along the
front by early evening. Nearly unidirectional south-southwesterlies
and uniform speeds with height will curtail overall effective bulk
shear. But this should help enhance growth into multicell clusters
favorable for producing sporadic severe gusts. Severe hail potential
may largely be confined to initial storm formation.

0250 PM CDT Sun Jun 22 2025

Areas affected...portions of eastern New Mexico into western Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 221950Z - 222115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...The risk for a few instances of severe wind/hail will
increase through the afternoon. The severe threat should be isolated
enough to preclude a WW issuance.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorms have recently shown an uptick in
intensity across portions of central NM into the TX Trans Pecos,
with a cell in Lincoln County, NM showing 40 dBZ echoes at 50 kft.
MLCINH is eroding due to strong diurnal heating, which is promoting
robust boundary-layer mixing, with 0-3 km lapse rates already
approaching the 9-10 C/km range in spots (per 19Z mesoanalysis).
Additional storms should continue to develop and intensify this
afternoon given persistent diurnal heating, with MLCAPE likely
exceeding 1000 J/kg. Vertical shear will be weak, and given marginal
MLCAPE, most storms should be pulse cellular or weakly
multicellular. Given steep low-level lapse rates, rapid evaporative
cooling with stronger storm cores may result in severe gusts and
perhaps a brief instance of hail. Since the severe threat should be
isolated, a WW issuance is not expected.

0234 PM CDT Sun Jun 22 2025

Areas affected...northwest MN and eastern ND

Concerning...Severe potential...Tornado Watch likely 

Valid 221934Z - 222130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...The tornado threat with a few supercells will increase
during the late afternoon to early evening as surface-based storms
develop across the Red River Valley through northwest Minnesota. A
tornado watch issuance is expected.

DISCUSSION...Airmass recovery is occurring across the Red River
Valley and northwest Minnesota in the wake of earlier elevated
thunderstorms. While another round of elevated thunderstorms has
formed well west into the post-frontal airmass across central ND,
this lobe of large-scale ascent will overspread the downstream
surface front and trough in the next couple hours. 19Z mesoanalysis
suggests that MLCIN has weakened. Surface-based thunderstorm
development by 21-22Z is likely. 

Weak easterly components to the low-level flow between the surface
front and trough will support favorable hodograph curvature as flow
veers to the south and south-southwest aloft. In conjunction with
optimal temperature-dew point spreads, a corridor of supercell
tornado potential is anticipated. Otherwise, large hail and isolated
severe gusts will be possible as storms likely become confined
closer to the international border this evening.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 453
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
400 PM CDT Sun Jun 22 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Central Nebraska
  Southeast South Dakota

* Effective this Sunday afternoon and evening from 400 PM until
  1100 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2
    inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Severe thunderstorms are expected to develop rapidly and
move northeast across the watch area through this evening with a
risk for damaging wind gusts and large hail.  The potential for
corridors of more concentrated wind damage may increase towards this
evening.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 60
statute miles east and west of a line from 45 miles northeast of
Mitchell SD to 60 miles south southeast of North Platte NE. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU3).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.

Mesoscale Discussion 1400
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0724 AM CDT Sun Jun 22 2025

Areas affected...Parts of eastern ND...northeast SD...western MN

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 221224Z - 221400Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Strong to locally severe storms are possible this morning.

DISCUSSION...Elevated convection is ongoing this morning from
east-central ND into northeast SD. This convection is being aided by
a low-amplitude midlevel shortwave trough moving quickly
northeastward toward northern MN. Midlevel lapse rates are quite
steep (as observed on the 12Z MPX sounding), and recent objective
mesoanalyses depict a corridor of very strong MUCAPE (3000-4000
J/kg) from eastern ND into northwest MN, near and north of a surface
boundary that will move north as a warm front with time today.
Ongoing convection could intensify as it moves into this corridor.
Deep-layer shear is also stronger with northern extent, and could
help to increase storm organization with time this morning.

Large hail and localized severe gusts may accompany these storms as
they move northeastward. The large buoyancy and steep lapse rates
will support a conditional threat of very large hail if any elevated
supercells can become established. Coverage of the severe threat
this morning is uncertain, making the need for short-term watch
issuance unclear. A more extensive severe threat is still expected
across parts of this region later today.
