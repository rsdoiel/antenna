Mesoscale Discussion 0350
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0717 AM CDT Wed Apr 02 2025

Areas affected...portions of western to east-central MO

Concerning...Tornado Watch 94...96...

Valid 021217Z - 021415Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 94, 96 continues.

SUMMARY...Strong/damaging gusts and a couple of tornadoes remain
possible across WW 94 and 96 over west-central MO. A downstream
watch may be needed later this morning, though timing is uncertain.

DISCUSSION...Strong to severe thunderstorms continue near a surface
cold front across western MO this morning. Boundary layer moistening
is slowly occurring as an intense low-level jet streams over the
area, contributing to enlarged, looping hodographs. Some rotation
has been noted amid the somewhat messy storm mode early this
morning. Capping and weaker instability with eastward extent likely
is tempering severe potential somewhat, but isolated strong gusts, a
couple of tornadoes and sporadic large hail remain possible. This
convection will continue to propagate eastward through the morning
and some potential for a downstream watch into east-central MO
exists. However, timing is uncertain as destabilization is expected
to be more modest across eastern MO through the morning hours.
Trends will continue to be monitored.

Mesoscale Discussion 0349
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0657 AM CDT Wed Apr 02 2025

Areas affected...northeast OK into extreme southwest MO/northwest AR

Concerning...Tornado Watch 95...96...

Valid 021157Z - 021400Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 95, 96 continues.

SUMMARY...Damaging wind and tornado potential may be maximized
across northeast Oklahoma into extreme southwest Missouri/northwest
Arkansas over the next couple of hours.

DISCUSSION...Recent radar trends have shows some propensity for
linear convection to become more supercellular. This activity is
moving across the max STP corridor (effective layer STP around 5-7)
amid strong vertical shear and moderate instability. While some
rotation has been occurring, and even a brief TDS was noted over
Tulsa and Rogers Counties in northeast OK, capping and storm motion
parallel to the surface front is likely limiting the longevity of
stronger/better organized cells within the broader line of
convection. Nevertheless, a couple of tornadoes, damaging gusts and
isolated large hail remain possible this morning.

Mesoscale Discussion 0348
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0615 AM CDT Wed Apr 02 2025

Areas affected...portions of North Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 021115Z - 021315Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated gusty winds and marginal hail to near 1 inch
possible this morning. Overall risk is expected to remain low and a
watch is not expected.

DISCUSSION...Elevated convection has developed along an
eastward-advancing cold front across western north Texas this
morning. Mid-60s dewpoints beneath steep midlevel lapse rates are
contributing to strong MLCAPE amid intense vertical shear. Capping
and modest linear forcing associated with the cold front will likely
preclude greater severe potential despite the favorable
thermodynamic and kinematic parameter space. Nevertheless, isolated
gusty winds and perhaps hail to near 1 inch diameter will be
possible. Watch issuance is not currently expected, but radar trends
will continue to be monitored through the morning.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0748 AM CDT Wed Apr 02 2025

Valid 021300Z - 031200Z

...THERE IS A HIGH RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF THE
MID-SOUTH AND LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY...

...SUMMARY...
A tornado outbreak is expected today and tonight from parts of the
lower Mississippi Valley into the Mid-South and lower Ohio Valley.
Numerous tornadoes, along with multiple EF3+ tornadoes, appear
likely. In addition, tornadoes, significant severe wind gusts, and
large hail to very large hail will be possible across a broad area
from north Texas northeastward to the southern Great Lakes.

...Synopsis...
A strong mid/upper-level trough with associated 100-120 kt mid-level
jet streak will advance quickly northeastward today across the Upper
Midwest and Great Lakes. A broader area of 50-70+ kt southwesterly
mid-level flow will persist over much of the southern Plains into
the lower/mid MS Valley and OH Valley. At the surface, the primary
low over far eastern NE/western IA this morning is forecast to
develop northeastward in tandem with the upper trough today,
eventually reaching the Upper Midwest by this evening. A trailing
cold front will continue east-southeastward across the southern
Plains and Ozarks today, before eventually stalling and lifting
northward as a warm front tonight. Weak secondary surface low
development is possible this afternoon and evening along or just
ahead of the front across AR into the Mid-South.

...Ozarks into the Lower/Mid Mississippi Valley, Mid-South, Ohio
Valley, and Southern Great Lakes...
Robust convection is ongoing this morning from northern MO
southwestward to southern OK and north TX along/near the cold front.
Even with some capping concerns noted on area soundings ahead of
this activity, a very strong (60-70 kt) southerly low-level jet is
providing ample low-level moisture transport to support continued
convective intensity. Steep mid-level lapse rates and strong
deep-layer shear are also fostering some embedded supercell
structures, with associated large hail threat. Otherwise, given the
strength of the low-level flow and very strong effective SRH,
scattered severe/damaging winds and a few tornadoes will remain the
primary threats with this line of convection as it continues
eastward this morning across the remainder of OK into AR and MO. A
strong tornado may occur with any sustained surface-based supercell.

The effect that this morning convection has on downstream afternoon
severe potential across the lower/mid MS Valley may be substantial.
Most guidance shows either a gradual weakening trend with the line
by late morning/early afternoon, or a devolution into a broken line
of supercells. Mid/high-level cloud debris could inhibit daytime
heating to some extent across much of the warm sector, and the
northern extent of the weakening line over northern MO may serve as
a cutoff for surface-based thunderstorms across the Midwest and OH
Valley later today. Even with these continued uncertainties, it
appears likely that a corridor of moderate to strong instability
will develop this afternoon across the lower MS Valley into the
Mid-South and lower OH Valley, generally ahead of whatever remains
of the ongoing/morning convection. With more nebulous/weaker
large-scale ascent over these regions given their spatial
displacement from the ejecting upper trough, there may be a more
mixed/supercell mode this afternoon/evening, particularly with
southward extent.

Current expectations are for several intense supercells and clusters
to develop by 20-00Z from far northern LA into eastern AR, northwest
MS, western TN/KY, and southeast MO, and southern IL/IN. This region
appears to have the most favorable overlap of moderate to strong
instability, strong deep-layer shear, and ample low-level shear to
support multiple tornadic storms. With most guidance showing
enlarged, curved hodographs through the boundary layer, and
effective SRH forecast to generally range 250-400+ m2/s2, several
strong tornadoes are likely. Multiple EF-3+ tornadoes should also
occur given the very favorable parameter space forecast, but this
high-end tornado potential may be dependent on a relative lack of
supercell/cluster interactions, which are difficult to pinpoint.
Still, based on latest high-resolution guidance trends showing
multiple intense supercells developing, the High Risk has been
expanded a bit southward with this update to include more of eastern
and south-central AR. The tornado and severe/damaging wind threat
will likely continue after dark, with updraft interactions
suggesting a messy mode, with clusters/lines and embedded supercells
all possible.

In addition to the tornado threat, large to very large hail (up to
2-3 inches in diameter) and severe/damaging wind gusts may occur
with these supercells and bowing clusters. A linear mode appears
more likely with northward extent across the mid MS Valley into the
southern Great Lakes as the cold front continues eastward today.
But, this area will also have less time to destabilize ahead of the
ongoing convection, which casts some uncertainty on the northern
extent of the substantial severe threat. Have trimmed the
Marginal/Slight Risks some across the Upper Midwest, but the
Enhanced Risk remains unchanged for now. Some risk for supercells
ahead of the line/clusters will exist across the OH Valley/Midwest.
But, confidence in this scenario occurring was not great enough to
expand the Moderate Risk for tornadoes northward into more of IN and
western OH.

...Southern Plains...
With the cold front expected to stall and eventually begin lifting
northward tonight, additional supercells may develop late in tandem
with ascent preceding another shortwave trough and a strengthening
southerly low-level jet. With steep mid-level lapse rates present
and ample MUCAPE and deep-layer shear, this convection should pose a
threat for mainly large to very large hail.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0400 AM CDT Wed Apr 02 2025

Valid 051200Z - 101200Z

...DISCUSSION...
The mid-level flow pattern will undergo significant amplification
over the next several days as a large western US trough begins to
move eastward. Very rich moisture will support widespread
thunderstorm potential across parts of the Southeast and eastern US
through the weekend.

...D4/Saturday Mid South...
The upper low over northern Mexico will continue to amplify as it
begins ejecting eastward across the lower and mid MS Valley. A
strong 100+ kt jet will move east of the trough and overspread a
relatively broad warm sector across the Sabine and MS Valleys into
parts of TN/KY. Unseasonably rich moisture from several days of
southerly flow will be in place ahead of a surface low and cold
front. One or more rounds of severe storms, including supercells,
appears likely from eastern TX into AR, LA, and MS through the day.
All hazards will be possible. Storms should eventually grow upscale
into a line or cluster and spread eastward overnight into parts of
AL, FL, and GA.

The northern bound of the risk area across the TN Valley and into
the OH valley appears somewhat conditional. Multiple preceding days
of storms may limit the northern extent of the deeper moisture and
buoyancy. However, some severe risk likely exists given the
intensity of the low-level jet and abundance of moisture.

...Day 5...
The severe threat is likely to carry over from Day 4 in the form of
a squall line, as the upper wave gradually devolves into a broader
positive-tilt trough. Strong mid-level flow and ascent will persist
over a broadening warm sector across the Southeast. While lapse
rates appear weak from several days of convection, some severe risk
is possible. The intensity of the severe risk will be heavily
dependent on the convective evolution from the prior day 4 which is
very unclear at the moment. Will add a 15% area across parts of AL,
FL, GA and SC where the best overlap of mid-level flow and robust
moisture are expected to support potential for damaging gusts.

A severe risk may also develop across parts of the Carolinas and mid
Atlantic Day5/Sunday. As the upper wave lifts to the north, ascent
will overspread returning surface moisture as far north as southern
PA. It is unclear how much buoyancy will be present with the
potential for widespread clouds. However, strong flow fields will be
available to any convection that can develop.

...D6+...
Offshore flow and high pressure will begin to dominate the extended
period as mid-level ridging intensifies over the center of the
country. Much cooler and stable conditions behind the advancing cold
front appear likely to temporarily end broader potential for severe
storms through early next week.
