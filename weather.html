Mesoscale Discussion 0467
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0722 AM CDT Fri Apr 18 2025

Areas affected...Southern Wisconsin...Lake Michigan

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 142...

Valid 181222Z - 181415Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 142
continues.

SUMMARY...A severe threat will likely continue over the next couple
of hours from parts of southern Wisconsin eastward over Lake
Michigan. Significant wind gusts and large hail will be possible
with the strongest of cells.

DISCUSSION...The latest high-resolution radar imagery from KMKX
shows a cluster of strong to severe storms over southern Wisconsin,
with a severe short line segment located about 40 statute miles to
the west of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The storms are located along an
east-to-west gradient of instability, where the RAP is estimating
MUCAPE around 1000 J/kg. RAP forecast soundings to the west of
Milwaukee still have a temperature inversion from the surface to 850
mb, with strong effective shear above the inversion. This will
continue to support elevated supercell development. In addition,
forecast soundings have steep lapse rates in the 700 to 500 mb
layer, which will aid a threat for large hail with supercells.
Hailstones greater than 2 inches in diameter will be possible in the
more intense cores. The stronger and faster moving line segments
could also produce severe gusts, with 70+ mph gusts possible. The
severe threat is expected to become more isolated later this
morning. To the east of the current watch, watch issuance probably
won't be needed. Trends will be monitored.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0700 AM CDT Fri Apr 18 2025

Valid 181300Z - 191200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM PARTS OF THE
SOUTHERN PLAINS INTO THE MID MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AND UPPER GREAT
LAKES...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are possible from parts of the
southern Plains northeastward toward the upper Great Lakes, mainly
from late afternoon into early Saturday morning. Large to very large
hail and severe wind gusts should be the main hazards, especially
across the southern Plains where storms will be more concentrated. A
few tornadoes also appear possible.

...Upper Great Lakes to Mid Mississippi Valley...
Ongoing, mostly elevated thunderstorms aided by persistent low-level
warm/moist advection and steep mid-level lapse rates should continue
to pose a large hail and damaging wind threat as they spread quickly
eastward across southern WI this morning. This activity should
eventually weaken later this morning as it continues moving across
Lower MI into a less unstable environment. Behind this initial
activity, the surface warm sector will attempt to spread northward
across parts of the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes today, as longwave
troughing gradually develops eastward over the northern/central
Plains and Southwest. Given the positive tilt/orientation of this
upper troughing and enhanced southwesterly flow aloft expected to
persist through the period, a strong cold front should make only
slow southeastward progress.

A cap will likely inhibit surface-based convective development until
peak afternoon heating and frontal forcing can help lift parcels to
their LFC. Given nebulous forcing aloft, there is still a fair
amount of uncertainty regarding overall convective coverage this
afternoon/evening. Even so, any thunderstorms that can develop along
or ahead of the front could pose a threat for severe hail and
damaging winds, with strong deep-layer shear aiding updraft
organization. This severe threat may persist for much of the
evening, and perhaps continuing into the early overnight hours.

...Southern Plains to the Ozarks...
The southern portion of the cold front is forecast to decelerate and
eventually stall over parts of OK later today. A dryline will extend
southward from a weak frontal low across northwest to west-central
TX by late afternoon. Even with widespread mid/high-level cloudiness
present, robust daytime heating of the moist warm sector is
anticipated across the southern Plains today. The low-level cap
should eventually be breached by late afternoon/early evening
(around 22-00Z), particularly along/near the cold front, and perhaps
the front/dryline intersection as well. Strong southwesterly flow
aloft and related deep-layer shear will likely support organized
severe convection.

Initial supercell development should pose a threat for large to very
large hail, potentially up to 2-3 inches in diameter. With time,
upscale growth into multiple clusters/short line segments is
expected through the evening into early Saturday morning, as a
south-southwesterly low-level jet gradually strengthens. An increase
in the severe/damaging wind threat is anticipated as this mode
transition occurs. The threat for a few tornadoes remains apparent,
especially across parts of OK along/south of the front, as favorable
low-level shear will be present this evening where supercells may
still exist. Even with a higher concentration of thunderstorms
expected across the southern Plains, the messy convective mode this
evening and tendency for convection to be undercut by the cold front
currently limit confidence in delineating a corridor of greater
severe hail/wind potential.

Mesoscale Discussion 0459
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0253 PM CDT Thu Apr 17 2025

Areas affected...parts of ern NE into wrn IA

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 171953Z - 172200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...The initiation of strong to severe thunderstorms,
including supercells posing a risk for large, potentially damaging,
hail may increase by 5-7 PM CDT, if not a bit earlier.  It is
possible that the potential for a tornado or two could increase
near/north and east of the Greater Omaha area later this evening.

DISCUSSION...Trailing the surface low, which is now migrating north
of the Redwood Falls MN vicinity, a surface cold front is
maintaining a southward advancement into/across the Sioux
Falls/Sioux City areas, Norfolk NE and the Grand
Island/Kearney/Hasting NE vicinities.  Substantive boundary-layer
warming and moistening (including surface dew points near 60F)
continues in a narrow corridor ahead of this feature, where
mixed-layer CAPE may continue to increase up to around 2000 J/kg
within the next few hours, beneath a warm and capping elevated
mixed-layer area.

Models continue to suggest that mid-level forcing for ascent
associated with a weak short wave perturbation may increasingly
contribute to subtle mid-level height falls and erosion of the
lower/mid-tropospheric inhibition as far south as the Lincoln and
Omaha NE vicinities by 22-00Z.  As this occurs, potential for the
initiation of thunderstorm activity will increase, both along and
ahead of the cold front.  Although there may be a tendency for
convection to become undercut by the front, convection allowing
model output suggests that forcing associated with pre-frontal warm
advection may maintain at least one or two sustained storms,
propagating to the right of the 30-40 kt west-southwesterly mean
flow.

As long as this occurs, it appears that the environment may become
conducive to supercells capable of produce swaths of large hail, at
least occasionally in excess of 2 inches in diameter.  Low-level
flow and shear are initially weak, but strengthening toward early
evening might result in an increase in potential for a tornado
near/north and east of Greater Omaha.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0257 PM CDT Thu Apr 17 2025

Valid 172000Z - 181200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM EASTERN
NEBRASKA INTO CENTRAL IOWA...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated to scattered severe thunderstorms are expected, mainly from
late afternoon into early tonight from eastern Nebraska into western
and central Iowa.  Very large hail to 3 inches in diameter or
greater, isolated severe gusts of 60-70 mph, and a couple of
tornadoes will all be possible.

...20Z Update...
Very minor changes were made to the outlook with this update. A
cluster of thunderstorms is evolving immediately ahead of the
surface low over southern MN, where low-level convergence is
maximized amid boundary-layer heating and decreasing inhibition.
Given around 40 kt of deep-layer shear (per MPX VWP), this activity
should gradually intensify through the afternoon, with a risk of
large hail and locally damaging wind gusts. Reference MCD #458 for
more information.

Farther south, the latest surface observations and radar imagery
depict gradually increasing boundary-layer convergence ahead of a
well-defined triple point over south-central/southeast NE. While
satellite imagery still suggests strong capping at the base of the
EML, expectations are still for isolated/discrete storm development
near the triple point in southeast NE later this afternoon into the
evening. The primary concern will be large to very large hail with
initially discrete supercells, with an increasing risk of damaging
winds and a couple of tornadoes into this evening. For additional
details, reference MCD #459.

..Weinman.. 04/17/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1129 AM CDT Thu Apr 17 2025/

...NE/IA/MN/MO through early tonight...
A belt of strong southwesterly mid-upper flow will extend from the
southern High Plains to the central Great Plains and upper MS
Valley, downstream of a large-scale trough over the West. 
Visible-satellite imagery late this morning shows a capped
stratocumulus shield from eastern OK northward into eastern KS and
the MO Valley.  This low-level moisture depicted on satellite
corresponds with a 10.0-11.5 g/kg lowest 100-mb mean mixing ratio
and dewpoints in the upper 50s to lower 60s.  Moisture will continue
northward on southerly flow to the east of a weak surface wave which
is expected to move along an associated baroclinic from the mid MO
Valley to the upper MS Valley, while a lee cyclone develops
south-southeastward across the central High Plains.  

Strong heating and continued moisture advection will result in
moderate to strong destabilization from eastern KS to eastern
NE/western IA and southern MN.  Models continue to show initial
thunderstorm development around 20z in southern MN and around 22z in
eastern NE (near and just east of the cold front/dryline triple
point).

Model forecast soundings over southern MN will favor a mix of
supercells and storm clusters capable of producing large hail
(generally 1-1.75 inch diameter) and isolated strong-severe gusts
(50-60 mph), and perhaps a brief tornado.  Farther south, greater
buoyancy and elongated hodographs will be more favorable for
supercells.  A long-track supercell or two is forecast from eastern
NE this evening into western/central IA through early tonight. 
Large to giant hail (peak diameter 2.75 to 3.5 inches) will be
possible with the more intense phase of the supercell activity.  A
narrow window of opportunity may exist for a couple of tornadoes
this evening with sufficient moisture (boundary-layer dewpoints near
60 F) as low-level shear increases.  Severe gusts will be possible
with the stronger storms before this activity wanes late this
evening into the overnight.

0249 PM CDT Thu Apr 17 2025

Valid 181200Z - 191200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF SOUTHERN/EASTERN NEW
MEXICO INTO FAR WEST TEXAS...

A slight eastward and northward expansion of Elevated fire weather
conditions was warranted across portions of the Texas Panhandle and
western Texas. Latest model guidance consensus delays/stalls the
cold front intrusion into the Texas Panhandle until Friday early
evening. This will act to prolong at least elevated fire weather
conditions across the Cap Rock area, including southwest winds of up
to 20 mph and relative humidity in falling into the lower teens by
mid-afternoon. Critical fire weather conditions are still expected
across much of southeast New Mexico and far west Texas as an
upper-level trough deepens across the Intermountain West.

...Florida...
Expect increased east winds Friday across the Florida Peninsula as
high pressure translates eastward into the Atlantic. Winds of 10-15
mph coupled with relative humidity in the 25-35 percent range amid
dry fuels will promote Elevated fire weather conditions for much of
central and southwest Florida.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1256 AM CDT Thu Apr 17 2025/

...Synopsis...
The upper trough will shift to the east with the stronger mid-level
winds within the southern/central Plains on Friday. Another surface
low, though weaker than Thursday, will develop along the New
Mexico/Texas border. A cold front will push farther south into parts
of the southern Plains. Fire weather concerns will remain across
parts of the Southwest and southern High Plains.

...New Mexico into West Texas...
Though mid-level flow will be weaker than the previous day, moderate
flow should remain across the region during the afternoon. Coupled
with the modest surface low, surface winds of 15-25 mph will be
possible. RH could fall around 10% for some locations, but will more
broadly be around 15-20%. Critical fire weather is most likely in
parts of southern and eastern New Mexico and the Trans-Pecos. There
is greater confidence in critically low RH as well as fuels being
more receptive here.

Valid 191200Z - 201200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM PARTS OF THE
SOUTHERN PLAINS TOWARD THE OZARKS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong to severe thunderstorms are possible from central
Texas into the Ohio Valley on Saturday.

...Synopsis...
An upper trough will move eastward across Ontario and Quebec,
deepening all the while. Meanwhile, a southern-stream low/trough
will move from AZ/NM into the southern Plains. This system will take
on a negative tilt into Sunday morning.

At the surface, a front will stall from PA westward to the middle MS
Valley, and southwestward into northwest TX. Upper 50s F to lower
60s F dewpoints will be common along and south of this boundary,
with the most substantial instability developing from west-central
TX into OK. Winds around 850 mb will initially be out of the
southwest across the entire warm sector, but backing and
strengthening will occur over the southern Plains late as the upper
trough approaches. At that time, a cold front will further increase
lift over TX and OK.

...From parts of OK across MO/IL/IN/OH/PA...
Substantial rain and thunderstorms are likely to be ongoing early on
Saturday north of the stationary front and aided by theta-e
advection just off the surface with 30+ kt southwest 850 mb winds.
While the low-level lapse rates will initially be poor, sufficient
elevated instability combined with strong deep-layer shear may
support marginal hail during the day. Indications are that heating
will be most prominent from the central Appalachians into parts of
the upper OH Valley and into PA, and a few diurnally driven cells
may produce marginal hail over OH and PA.

...TX/OK into the Ozarks...
Scattered storms may redevelop from northern TX into OK during the
day, as low-level moisture advection is maintained across the warm
sector and north of the boundary. Lapse rates will likely be poor
due to extensive clouds and persistent showers/storms.

Later in the day, strong heating over southwest TX and lift near the
cold front should allow for new development over west-central TX
during the late afternoon, with increasing storm coverage as the
low-level jet increases through the night. A few supercells may
develop in this region, producing large hail. The front may tend to
undercut the activity, but a brief tornado cannot be ruled out.
Farther north, batches of elevated storms will spread out of TX and
into OK, with both periodic hail and heavy rain threat (see WPC Day
3 Excessive Rainfall Product).

Valid 181200Z - 191200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM PARTS OF THE
SOUTHERN PLAINS NORTHEASTWARD TOWARD THE UPPER GREAT LAKES...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are possible from parts of the
southern Plains northeastward toward the upper Great Lakes from late
Friday afternoon into early Saturday morning. Large hail and
isolated severe gusts will be the main hazards.

...Synopsis...
A broad belt of strong southwest winds aloft will stretch from Baja
CA to the Great Lakes, with an upper trough extending from Manitoba
into the Great Basin. Meanwhile, upper ridging will occur over the
eastern states, with a high over the Gulf Of America. 

At the surface, a large area of high pressure will exist over the
east, with southeast flow around the high bringing moisture off the
Gulf and into southern Plains and Midwest. This moistening will
occur ahead of a cold front, stretching roughly from southern WI
into central MO and OK at 00Z. This front will gradually progress
south and east, and will be the primary focus for scattered severe
storms on Friday.

...Lower MO Valley into OK and TX...
Strong surface heating will occur over TX and into western OK Friday
afternoon, as mid 60s F dewpoints surge northward toward the
approaching cold front. This front will be near I-40 at 00Z, with
clusters of severe storms likely developing in the heated air from
western OK into northwest TX. MLCAPE over 2500 J/kg is possible, and
wind profiles south of the cold front will favor supercells. Initial
development may produce a couple tornadoes prior to the cold front
undercutting the storms as they progress east/northeastward across
OK. Very large hail will be possible on both side of the front as
hodographs will be elongated and primarily front-parallel.  

Farther northeast into KS and MO, additional lift via warm advection
late in the day and into the evening will also support clusters of
severe storms, possibly elevated but also with hail and localized
wind potential.

...Upper Great Lakes southward into the mid MO Valley...
Strong warm advection will result in elevated thunderstorms by
midday over parts of WI and into northern/Upper MI, with sufficient
instability to support an elevated marginal hail risk.  Farther
south, late afternoon development is likely along the front from
southern WI to the IA/IL border area and into MO, aided by daytime
heating. Though capped, lift along the boundary should instigate
scattered cells near 00Z, with isolated supercells tracking across
IL, IN, and perhaps southern MI and northwest OH. Winds just off the
surface will be quite strong at over 50 kt, aiding wind gusts. A
brief tornado cannot be ruled out across this region, and scattered
hail is likely as well.

Valid 171700Z - 181200Z

...EXTREMELY CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF NEW MEXICO INTO
WESTERN OKLAHOMA AND TEXAS PANHANDLES...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF THE SOUTHWEST INTO THE
SOUTHERN/CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS...

Latest model guidance consensus and surface observations suggest
corridor of Extreme fire weather conditions should extend from
southwestern and central New Mexico into far western portions of the
Oklahoma and Texas Panhandles this afternoon. In addition, Critical
highlights were extended slightly eastward into western Oklahoma and
northwest Texas. An accelerating mid-level jet over the Southwest
and deepening lee surface trough will support southwest winds of
30-40 mph across southwestern New Mexico into the Oklahoma/Texas
Panhandles. A dry, well-mixed boundary layer will reinforce
widespread relative humidity of 10 percent or less across much of
New Mexico and adjacent High Plains. This weather environment will
allow for Critical to Extreme fire weather conditions supportive of
rapid fire spread in dry fuels.

..Williams/Moore.. 04/17/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1255 AM CDT Thu Apr 17 2025/

...Synopsis...
A potent mid-level jet will overspread New Mexico during the
afternoon today. A surface low will deepen near the Colorado/Kansas
border. A broad region of high-end fire weather will be present
across parts of the Southwest and the adjacent southern/central High
Plains.

...New Mexico...
The most significant fire weather concerns are expected from
southwest into northeast New Mexico. Here, the mid-level jet will be
quite favorably timed with peak heating. Sustained wind of 30-40 mph
and gusts of 55-65 mph appear probable during the afternoon. RH of
5-10% can be expected. With ERCs near or above the 90th percentile
(with some around the 97th), significant fire spread can be expected
with any ignitions.

...Southern High Plains...
While some transitioning/greening fuels complicate the forecast, the
still intense meteorological conditions will drive critical fire
weather for parts of West Texas. Areas of the eastern Panhandle and
South Plains (areas primarily east of the Caprock) will see
similarly dry and windy conditions, but less receptive fuels (per
TICC and other local fuel information) will keep fire weather
elevated. RH of 5-15% with winds of 15-25 mph are expected. The
highest wind speeds will be near the New Mexico border into the
northwest Texas and Oklahoma Panhandles.

...Central High Plains...
With the deepening surface low and some portion of the mid-level jet
impacting the region, westerly downslope winds in Colorado and
southwesterly winds in Kansas will promote elevated to critical fire
weather. Strong winds (20-30 mph) are expected for much of the Front
Range into southwest Kansas. RH will be similarly low as farther
south/west -- values ranging from 5-15%. The fire weather threat
will extend as far north as the cold front. A few locations could
see elevated to briefly critical conditions prior to winds shifting
to the north and RH quickly rising.

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM EASTERN
NEBRASKA INTO CENTRAL IOWA...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated to scattered severe thunderstorms are expected, mainly from
late afternoon into early tonight from eastern Nebraska into western
and central Iowa.  Very large hail to 3 inches in diameter or
greater, isolated severe gusts of 60-70 mph, and a couple of
tornadoes will all be possible.

...NE/IA/MN/MO through early tonight...
A belt of strong southwesterly mid-upper flow will extend from the
southern High Plains to the central Great Plains and upper MS
Valley, downstream of a large-scale trough over the West. 
Visible-satellite imagery late this morning shows a capped
stratocumulus shield from eastern OK northward into eastern KS and
the MO Valley.  This low-level moisture depicted on satellite
corresponds with a 10.0-11.5 g/kg lowest 100-mb mean mixing ratio
and dewpoints in the upper 50s to lower 60s.  Moisture will continue
northward on southerly flow to the east of a weak surface wave which
is expected to move along an associated baroclinic from the mid MO
Valley to the upper MS Valley, while a lee cyclone develops
south-southeastward across the central High Plains.  

Strong heating and continued moisture advection will result in
moderate to strong destabilization from eastern KS to eastern
NE/western IA and southern MN.  Models continue to show initial
thunderstorm development around 20z in southern MN and around 22z in
eastern NE (near and just east of the cold front/dryline triple
point).

Model forecast soundings over southern MN will favor a mix of
supercells and storm clusters capable of producing large hail
(generally 1-1.75 inch diameter) and isolated strong-severe gusts
(50-60 mph), and perhaps a brief tornado.  Farther south, greater
buoyancy and elongated hodographs will be more favorable for
supercells.  A long-track supercell or two is forecast from eastern
NE this evening into western/central IA through early tonight. 
Large to giant hail (peak diameter 2.75 to 3.5 inches) will be
possible with the more intense phase of the supercell activity.  A
narrow window of opportunity may exist for a couple of tornadoes
this evening with sufficient moisture (boundary-layer dewpoints near
60 F) as low-level shear increases.  Severe gusts will be possible
with the stronger storms before this activity wanes late this
evening into the overnight.

...DISCUSSION...
...Day 4/Sun - ArkLaTex to the Mid-MS Valley...

A compact upper shortwave trough is forecast to move from the
southern High Plains to the Midwest on Sunday. While some forecast
uncertainty continues with regard to exact position of this feature,
the overall pattern suggests isolated to scattered severe
thunderstorm potential will exist across portions of east TX into
the Mid/Lower MS Valley. 

Strong southwesterly flow aloft will overspread a moist warm sector
as a surface low lifts north/northeast from OK into the Lower MO
Valley through early evening. A trailing cold front will spread east
as this occurs, while a warm front extends eastward from the Mid-MS
Valley into the OH Valley. Evolution of prior days convection is
resulting in some uncertainty regarding the western/northern extent
of severe potential. Nevertheless, a favorable environment
supporting at least isolated severe storms should extend from east
TX into parts of southern MO/IL ahead of the cold front.

...Days 5-8/Mon-Thu...

Forecast ensemble guidance from both the GEFS and EPS suggest
low-amplitude west/southwesterly flow will overspread the southern
tier of the U.S. next week. Southerly low-level flow on Day 5/Mon
across the western Gulf into the southern Plains in the wake of the
cold frontal passage on Day 4/Sun will allow for northward transport
of modified moisture. This should continue into Day 6/Tue across the
Plains. Some localized severe risk could develop across parts of the
southern Plains as an upper shortwave trough moves across the
north-central U.S. on Day 6/Tue, but poor juxtaposition between
higher quality moisture across OK/TX and stronger forcing across the
northern Plains/Upper Midwest may limit overall potential. This
low-amplitude pattern will continue through Day 8, resulting in low
predictability.

Areas affected...parts of swrn into s cntrl KS

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 162049Z - 162315Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...An isolated supercell or two may evolve from initially
high-based thunderstorm development by 6-7 PM CDT, posing primarily
a risk for severe hail and locally strong surface gusts.

DISCUSSION...As boundary-layer heating and mixing continues,
deepening high-based convective development is ongoing in a corridor
near/north of the Raton Mesa vicinity into southwestern Kansas. 
This appears focused downstream of a weak mid-level perturbation,
which is progressing toward the crest of large-scale mid-level
ridging across the southern Rockies through southern Great Plains. 
With continuing insolation, this convective development is likely to
persist and gradually spread northeastward and eastward with the
supporting large-scale forcing for ascent.  

Strongest boundary-layer heating appears focused northwest of the
Dalhart TX toward Dodge City KS vicinity, where surface dew points
remain in the upper 30s to lower 40s F.  However, more substantive
moistening is ongoing farther east, including a corridor across the
Medicine Lodge toward Great Bend KS vicinities, where dew points may
continue to increase into and through the lower mid 50s F, as
southerly low-level flow strengthens through 23-00Z.  It appears
that this may contribute mixed-layer CAPE increasing to the order of
1000 J/kg.

In the presence of lower/mid-tropospheric warm advection, the
boundary-layer destabilization may largely remain suppressed by
warming, elevated mixed-layer air.  However, the eventual
intensification of initially high-based convection overspreading the
region appears at least possible later this afternoon, particularly
near/east of the Dodge City vicinity, aided by inflow of the
potentially more unstable air.  If this becomes sustained, shear
beneath moderate to strong westerly mid/upper flow appears more than
sufficient to support the evolution an isolated boundary-layer based
supercell or two, primarily posing a risk for severe hail and
locally strong surface gusts.

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 141810Z - 142115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Showers spreading southeastward through the mid Missouri
Valley may begin to intensify by 3-4 PM CDT, with a few weak
thunderstorms developing and posing increasing potential for strong
to severe surface gusts while spreading southeastward through the
remainder of the afternoon.

DISCUSSION...In the wake of a deep cyclone, now migrating northeast
of the Upper Great Lakes region, downward mixing of momentum is
already contributing to 30-35+ kt northwesterly surface gusts across
much of the middle Missouri Valley, as boundary-layer warming
progresses.  This is occurring just ahead of a vigorous short wave
trough now digging through the western Dakotas, and forecast to
continue rapidly southeastward through early evening.  

Models indicate that the mid-level cold core (including -30 to -35C
around 500 mb) will overspread a corridor from central South Dakota
through northeastern Iowa between 20-23Z, coincident with further
strengthening of northwesterly flow (35-40+ kt) in the 850-700 mb
layer and peak afternoon surface heating.  As this occurs, forecast
soundings indicate that profiles will become increasingly conducive
to deepening convection capable of producing lightning. 

With at least some further intensification of ongoing developing
convection, evaporative cooling and melting of precipitation within
an increasing well-mixed boundary layer (characterized by sizable
surface temperature/dew point spreads on the order of 20+ F),
coupled with the downward mixing of stronger flow aloft, seems
likely to contribute to increasing potential for surface gusts
approaching or briefly exceeding severe limits.  This may continue
into early evening, as convection spreads southeastward, before
rapidly diminishing with the onset of boundary-layer cooling.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 138
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
325 PM EDT Mon Apr 14 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Central and Eastern Kentucky
  Southern Ohio
  Far Southwestern Pennsylvania
  Southwestern Virginia
  West Virginia

* Effective this Monday afternoon and evening from 325 PM until
  1100 PM EDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph likely
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2
    inches in diameter possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms coverage is expected to increase over the
next few hours along and ahead of a cold front pushing eastward
across the region. Environmental conditions support strong to severe
storms. An initially cellular mode will favor large hail and
damaging gusts before a transition to a more linear storm mode
favors primarily damaging gusts.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 80
statute miles north and south of a line from 30 miles west of
Lexington KY to 60 miles north northeast of White Sulphur Springs
WV. For a complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch
outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU8).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
24040.
