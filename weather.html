Mesoscale Discussion 0577
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0349 PM CDT Sun Apr 27 2025

Areas affected...parts of nw TX into the TX Pnhdl

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 272049Z - 272245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Probabilities for thunderstorm development appear low, but
may not be negligible late this afternoon into early evening, with
the environment conditionally supportive of supercells posing a risk
for large hail and tornadoes.  If and when it becomes more certain
that storms will form, a severe weather watch will probably be
needed.

DISCUSSION...Boundary-layer moisture characterized by lower/mid 60s
surface dew points is being maintained across the Lubbock through
Amarillo vicinities, beneath a deep warm elevated mixed-layer based
between 850-700 mb, just east of a dryline which may mix only slowly
northeastward/eastward into early evening.  This appears to be
contributing to strong potential instability (3000+ J/kg), beneath
moderate to strong southwesterly mid/upper flow (including 40-70+ kt
in the 500-300 mb layer), and an environment conditionally
supportive of intense supercells.

Perhaps due to the warm/dry air at mid-levels, and weak large-scale
forcing for ascent, convection allowing guidance, in particular,
continues to indicate generally low potential for thunderstorm
initiation through early evening.  However, at least attempts at
deepening convective development are evident to the west of the
dryline, and objective analysis indicates a possible secondary
maximum in dryline convergence developing near/north of Lubbock
toward areas west of Amarillo.   

Of particular concern, if a sustained storm does develop during the
next couple of hours, there appears potential for rapid
intensification while propagating across the dryline.  Toward
23-00Z, strengthening south-southeasterly low-level flow (in excess
of 30 kt around 850 mb) may contribute to enlarging clockwise curved
low-level hodographs increasingly supportive of potential for
tornadoes, in addition to large, potentially damaging hail.

Mesoscale Discussion 0576
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0347 PM CDT Sun Apr 27 2025

Areas affected...Western Kansas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 272047Z - 272245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Watch issuance in western Kansas is currently unlikely.
Significant severe would be possible if storms develop.
Observational trends will be monitored.

DISCUSSION...Periodic enhancement to the cumulus field in western
Kansas has been noted in day cloud phase satellite imagery,
primarily in the vicinity of Goodland. Low 60s F dewpoints ahead of
the surface trough/modest dryline has allowed around 2500 J/kg
MLCAPE to develop. With the generally weak dryline circulation and
uncertain/subtle mid-level ascent, the development of deep
convection is far from a given. Only the more aggressive of the CAM
models suggests development later this afternoon. However, despite
this uncertainty, the environment will be conditionally favorable
for significant severe if storms can form. Supercells would be
likely given 40-45 kts of effective shear perpendicular to the
dryline. Furthermore, a strong increase in 850 mb winds after 00Z
would support a tornado threat.

Watch issuance appears unlikely at this time, but observational
trends (including observed sounding data) will be monitored over the
next few hours.

Areas affected...2Nebraska Panhandle into the Sandhills and
Southwest Nebraska

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 272029Z - 272230Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated to widely scattered supercell potential should
increase over the next 2-3 hours. Large/very-large hail and severe
gusts will be possible. The tornado threat will initially be low,
but will increase for storms persisting near/after sunset. Trends
will be monitored for watch issuance.

DISCUSSION...As the lee trough continues to deepen this afternoon,
clusters of cumulus clouds have begun to develop in northeast
Colorado. With time and the approach of a shortwave trough, a
surface low will become more evident in eastern Colorado. Low 60s F
dewpoints have already reached parts of northwest Kansas and should
continue north and west as low-level winds respond to the surface
cyclone.

Effective shear of around 45 kts across the trough axis will promote
discrete storm development. Steep mid-level lapse rates and
initially long, straight hodographs will promote a risk for
large/very-large hail and severe winds. As the low-level jet
increases this evening, any mature supercells ongoing will have an
increased potential to produce a tornado. Storm coverage is somewhat
uncertain, but isolated to widely scattered supercells appear
possible given at least modest mid-level ascent expected over the
next few hours.

Mesoscale Discussion 0574
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0255 PM CDT Sun Apr 27 2025

Areas affected...,parts of swrn TX

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 271955Z - 272100Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...The initiation of a couple of storms appears increasingly
likely near and northwest through north of Fort Stockton through 4-5
PM CDT.  More rapid thunderstorm intensification accompanied by
increasing potential for large hail and locally damaging wind gusts
may be initially slow, before probably increasing toward early
evening around the Midland through Big Spring vicinities.

DISCUSSION...The boundary-layer is becoming strongly heated and
deeply mixed across the Davis Mountains vicinity of southwest Texas
into the Texas South Plains.  The dryline is sharpening east through
north of Fort Stockton, where 2-hourly surface pressure falls around
2.0+ mb have been observed the past couple of hours, and low-level
convergence appears strongest.

Deepening convective development is ongoing within the deeper
mixed-boundary layer around Fort Stockton, where surface
temperature/dew point spreads are around 50 F (95/44), but forecast
soundings and HREF guidance suggests that the initiation of at least
isolated thunderstorm development is increasingly probable through
21-22Z.  It appears that this may be aided by forcing associated
with a mid-level speed maximum within southwesterly flow emanating
from the northern Mexican Plateau.

Downstream of slow moving large-scale mid-level troughing over the
southern Great Basin and Southwest, after at least some further
eastward mixing of the dryline late this afternoon, it probably will
begin to retreat northwest across the Pecos Valley vicinity toward
23-00Z.  As this occurs, convection may acquire more substantively
unstable updraft inflow (including most unstable CAPE up to
2000-3000+ J/kg), supporting increasing potential for rapid
thunderstorm intensification, in the presence of strong deep-layer
shear.  This may including a splitting supercell or two, posing a
risk for large hail and a few strong surface gusts.

Until then, though, initial thunderstorm development will probably
be more modest in strength, but could still pose some risk for
producing severe hail and wind.

0252 PM CDT Sun Apr 27 2025

Valid 272000Z - 281200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR MUCH OF THE
GREAT PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated to scattered severe thunderstorms are possible mainly this
evening into early morning Monday across parts of the Great Plains.
Large to very large hail, severe gusts, and a few tornadoes are all
possible.

...20z Update...
The previous forecast remains on track with no appreciable changes
required. Signs of broad-scale ascent beginning to overspread the
High Plains west of the surface trough/dryline are evident in latest
GOES imagery. Shallow cumulus is beginning to develop from western
NE southward into west TX, which suggests that convective initiation
within this corridor should become more probable within the next few
hours as we approach peak diurnal heating and dryline circulations
are maximized. West Texas Mesonet observations are sampling higher
dewpoints (by about 2-3 F) and stronger surface convergence than
anticipated by most model solutions. This suggests that the
probability of realizing the potent convective environment may be
increasing across the TX Panhandle (though confidence in storm
coverage remains too limited to warrant any upgrades). Further
north, recent RAP analyses show the tightest low-level lapse rate
gradient across western KS, indicative of a tighter/stronger dryline
circulation. This trend supports some recent high-res guidance that
shows convective initiation between 21-00z across this region and
warrants maintaining the current risk probabilities. Similarly,
steady surface pressure falls across western NE/SD suggest that
ascent is strongest across the central High Plains region, which
should favor at least isolated thunderstorm development this
afternoon. See the previous discussion below for additional details.

..Moore.. 04/27/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1130 AM CDT Sun Apr 27 2025/

...Synopsis...
Water-vapor imagery this morning shows a mid- to upper-level low
over NV.  A belt of strong southwesterly mid to high-level flow will
extend from the base of the western U.S. trough through the
southern/central High Plains later today into tonight.  A pair of
smaller-scale disturbances are forecast to eject east-northeastward
into the central High Plains and Black Hills vicinity during the
mid-late evening.  Concurrently, an upper ridge over the eastern
half of the Great Plains states will shift eastward over the MS
Valley towards daybreak Monday.  

Late morning surface analysis shows a developing low centered over
southeast WY with a lee trough/dryline extending southward through
the southern High Plains.  The cyclone will deepen near the WY/NE/CO
border through early evening before developing northeast into
central SD late tonight.  

...Southeast MT...Western Dakotas...
A sharpening lee trough is forecast by late this afternoon amidst
appreciable heating and moistening, especially across western SD. 
Model guidance shows a narrow plume of 500-2000 J/kg MLCAPE (highest
over SD) developing by mid-late afternoon as large-scale ascent
begins to overspread the region.  Isolated to widely scattered
thunderstorms are forecast to develop from the northern NE Panhandle
to the Black Hills, and north of the developing low over southeast
MT by late afternoon.  The stronger storms will gradually move into
richer moisture with an accompanying risk for mainly large hail and
severe gusts.  Gradual cooling during the evening will favor a
transition to elevated storms evolving with time as a LLJ
strengthens tonight.  A severe risk will probably develop farther
east in association with WAA into parts of the eastern Dakotas and
MN late.

...Central/Southern High Plains...
Visible-satellite imagery indicates a very moist boundary layer with
a mix of a cumulus field across central and north TX and eastern
NM/CO and stratus from the TX Caprock northward through OK to NE. 
The depth and quality of moisture sampled by the 12z Midland,
Amarillo, and Dodge City raobs is considered seasonably moisture
rich, and is located beneath an elevated mixed layer.  Additional
moistening through advection and evaporation will contribute to 60s
dewpoints east of a dryline/lee trough by late afternoon.  Strong
heating is forecast near the dryline from western NE southward
through West TX, which will result in a weakly capped but moderate
to very unstable airmass by 21z.  Large-scale forcing for ascent
across the region will be nebulous, but low-level convergence along
the dryline amid little to no convective inhibition may result in
convective initiation. 

With dryline convergence as the mechanism for convective initiation,
predictability is low.  Dryline circulations will likely be
strongest across the TX Panhandle/West TX where temperatures west of
the dryline will be warmest, but low-level convergence will likely
maximize in the CO/NE/KS border intersection vicinity near a
developing surface low.  As a result, these two areas may have a
greater risk for thunderstorms (isolated, widely spaced storm
coverage) late this afternoon into the evening. 

The overall environment will be very supportive of supercells with
any storms that do form, with large to very large hail as the
primary risk initially. If any storms manage to develop and become
sustained, a strengthening low-level jet will support a tornado
threat during the evening with any storms that persist (or develop
along the retreating dryline).  Nocturnal cooling and increased CINH
by mid to late evening will act to eventually weaken storm activity
in this region.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHERN NEW MEXICO INTO FAR WEST
TEXAS...

...Southern New Mexico into far west Texas...
A lingering mid-level jet atop a very dry, well-mixed boundary layer
will result in west-southwest surface winds of 15-25 mph in addition
to single digit relative humidity across southern New Mexico into
far western Texas Monday afternoon. These conditions amid ERC values
at or exceeding the 97th percentile supports the addition of
Critical highlights.

...Southeastern Colorado...
Enhanced downslope winds and drying will support at least an
Elevated fire weather threat across southeastern Colorado through
early afternoon where the fuels seasonal green-up has been delayed.
Expect west-southwest surface winds of 15-20 mph and localized
single digit relative humidity through early afternoon before a dry
cold front arrives overnight.

..Williams.. 04/27/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0358 AM CDT Sun Apr 27 2025/

...Synopsis...
A lingering mid-level trough over the western U.S. (and its
associated southwest flow), along with deep boundary layer mixing,
will result in at least Elevated fire-weather conditions across
portions of central and eastern New Mexico on Monday.

...Central and Eastern New Mexico...
With receptive fuels (ERCs exceeding the 80th-90th annual
percentiles) and dry, windy conditions across much of central and
eastern New Mexico, at least Elevated fire-weather conditions are
expected. 00Z HREF guidance suggests that there is potential for
Critical conditions, particularly across central New Mexico, but
there is enough ensemble spread in the HREF to preclude adding
highlights at this time. While the dry and windy conditions are
likely to occur further east into the Texas Panhandle, recent
wetting rainfall over the last several days should limit fire
danger.

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS IN PARTS OF OH
TO WESTERN PA/NY...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are likely across parts of the Lower
Great Lakes on Tuesday afternoon/evening. Scattered severe
thunderstorms are possible southwestward into the southern Great
Plains. Isolated significant-severe potential, mainly from hail, is
apparent across west Texas and separately in parts of the eastern
Midwest to Lower Great Lakes.

...Synopsis...
A consolidated shortwave trough should move east across the Great
Lakes and southeast Canada. A southern-stream trough over the
Southwest to northwest Mexico should drift east. Primary surface
cyclone over northeast ON should quickly progress towards the
Canadian Maritimes. An attendant cold front will push across the
central to Lower Great Lakes Tuesday afternoon and evening. A weaker
surface low should remain anchored over the TX Trans-Pecos. 

...Eastern Midwest/Lower Great Lakes...
The eastern extent of a pervasive EML will support potential for at
least moderate buoyancy across a broadening warm-moist sector ahead
of the aforementioned cold front. Rather strong mid-level westerlies
should be present from the Great Lakes vicinity northward, trailing
in magnitude but still moderate to strong across the OH Valley.
While evolution of early-day convection from late D2 is uncertain,
potential exists for pronounced boundary-layer heating amid robust
low-level moistening to the northeast. With stronger mid-level
height falls north of the international border, overall setup could
favor discrete to semi-discrete supercells that eventually merge
into clusters/short lines by evening. Confidence is sufficient in
upgrading/expanding categorical risks along with adding a
significant severe highlight, most likely for hail at this time. 

...TX/OK...
Multiple rounds of thunderstorms are expected through the period
along a convectively modulated, quasi-stationary baroclinic zone.
This renders enough uncertainty to mitigate a corridor of greater
severe potential, but a mesoscale-driven Enhanced Risk may be needed
in later outlooks. Adequate mid-level southwesterlies will persist
through the period for supercells, with most guidance hinting at
training convection along the west/southwest to east-northeast
oriented portion of the zone near the Red River. More probable
scenario for very large hail should exist to the southwest of that
corridor, with a few dryline supercells favored in the late
afternoon to early evening.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1233 PM CDT Sun Apr 27 2025

Valid 281200Z - 291200Z

...THERE IS A MODERATE RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS IN SOUTHERN
MN/NORTHERN IA/WESTERN WI...

...SUMMARY...
Multiple corridors of severe thunderstorms are expected across the
Upper Midwest on Monday into Monday night, with a regional severe
weather outbreak possible. The most dangerous period is likely
during the late afternoon and evening when strong tornado potential
should be maximized. Scattered large to very large hail and damaging
winds are likely as well.

...Synopsis...
A positive-tilt, upper-level trough will consist of multiple
embedded shortwave impulses, moving east-northeast from the central
High Plains to the Upper Midwest. A belt of 70+ kt 500-mb
southwesterlies will be present from the central Great Plains to the
Upper MS Valley on Monday afternoon. Primary surface cyclone should
deepen slightly during the day as it advances from eastern SD to the
Upper Great Lakes. A dryline will extend from the Mid-MO Valley
south-southwest into west TX. A cold front will overtake the dryline
as it surges southeast Monday night. 

...Upper Midwest...
After coordination with affected WFOs, primary adjustments have
occurred along the southern extent of the severe probabilities to
account for a more conditional, but still potentially significant
severe threat.

An arc of elevated thunderstorms will be ongoing at 12Z Monday from
ND across the Upper MS Valley. Isolated large hail will be possible
with these morning storms as they move east-northeast. Additional
elevated storms will redevelop towards midday/early afternoon to the
northeast of the aforementioned surface low. This will slow the
advancement of the surface warm front into central MN, but
strengthen differential surface heating across the baroclinic zone,
with greater warming nosing north from NE into southeast SD.
Surface-based storm development should occur by mid-afternoon across
a portion of the Mid-MO Valley into southwest/west-central MN along
the dryline to surface low. Large hail should be the primary initial
threat, but cells may congeal into linear clusters, especially
near/across the warm front. A mix of hail/wind/embedded tornadoes is
likely, with the latter increasing with southern/eastern extent
during late afternoon owing to stronger low-level shear across
southeast MN/northeast IA into western WI. 

Open warm-sector storm development ahead of the dryline is nebulous
with low confidence on the degree of ascent ahead of the dryline
given the synoptic setup. Conditionally, both the buoyancy/shear
parameter space is volatile and supportive of potential for multiple
long-track, tornadic supercells. Timing of mid-level height falls
tends to favor the evening period after peak heating but CAM
signals, outside of the 12Z FV3, are sparse. Greater large-scale
ascent appears focused from far northeast IA into WI. This region
remains the most favorable for discrete warm-sector development
during the evening. Otherwise, upstream linear clusters from
southern/eastern MN will likely spread across northern/central WI
into parts of Upper MI with a mixed mode of all hazards persisting,
before eventually weakening overnight. 

...Eastern KS/northern MO to west TX...
Overall forcing will be weaker farther south along the dryline, but
subtle mid-level height falls across a mostly uncapped warm sector
should result in isolated to scattered supercell development during
the late afternoon to evening. This appears most likely across
western north TX into southwest OK where greater boundary-layer
heating and a nocturnally strengthening low-level jet are
anticipated.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1138 AM CDT Sun Apr 27 2025

Valid 271700Z - 281200Z

...EXTREMELY CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN NEW
MEXICO INTO FAR WEST TEXAS...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR MUCH OF CENTRAL NEW MEXICO INTO
FAR WEST TEXAS...

...Southeast Pennsylvania and New Jersey...
Elevated highlights were added across portions of southeastern
Pennsylvania and New Jersey where strong offshore flow within a
post-frontal regime is ongoing. Northwest winds of 15-25 mph with
gusts up to 40 mph combined with relative humidity falling into the
25-35 percent range are expected through the early afternoon before
winds subside late afternoon. Rainfall over the last 48 hours was
spotty so pockets of receptive fuels remain, primarily in the New
Jersey Pinelands.

...Southwest and adjacent High Plains...
Significant fire weather threat remains across the Southwest with
swath of Extremely Critical highlights in place across much of
southern and central New Mexico. Elevated highlights were extended
into far southeastern Utah and far western Colorado to account for
some lower elevation receptive fuels. Otherwise, previous forecast
(see below) remains on track.

..Williams.. 04/27/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0109 AM CDT Sun Apr 27 2025/

...Synopsis...
With a mid-level trough translating across the Intermountain West,
and a lee cyclone deepening over the central High Plains, strong
surface winds and deep boundary layer mixing are forecast across
much of the Southwest into the southern High Plains. Critical to
Extremely Critical fire-weather conditions are expected across much
of southern and central New Mexico, into portions of far West Texas.


...Central/Southern New Mexico into Far West Texas...
Widespread 30+ MPH winds and 5-10% relative humidity is anticipated
over much of southern, central, and even portions of eastern New
Mexico. While dry and windy conditions are anticipated further east
of the current highlights, recent wetting rainfall in eastern New
Mexico over the last several days will serve to limit the
receptiveness of fuels to wildfire ignition and spread. Therefore,
Critical and Extremely Critical highlights have been confined to
where fuels guidance shows ERCs exceeding the 90th annual
percentile, primarily across southern and central New Mexico. 

...Eastern Colorado...
Elevated highlights have been maintained over eastern Colorado,
where dormant/fine fuels are anticipated to be receptive to wildfire
ignition and spread with an environment characterized by 10%
relative humidity and 15-20 MPH winds. Some recent wetting rainfall
has occurred across eastern Colorado, with areas receiving 0.75-2.0
inches of rainfall in the last 48 hours. The Elevated highlights in
this update reflect the driest areas receiving little to no
rainfall.

1130 AM CDT Sun Apr 27 2025

Valid 271630Z - 281200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR MUCH OF THE
GREAT PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated to scattered severe thunderstorms are possible mainly this
evening into early morning Monday across parts of the Great Plains.
Large hail to very large hail, severe gusts, and a few tornadoes are
all possible.

...Synopsis...
Water-vapor imagery this morning shows a mid- to upper-level low
over NV.  A belt of strong southwesterly mid to high-level flow will
extend from the base of the western U.S. trough through the
southern/central High Plains later today into tonight.  A pair of
smaller-scale disturbances are forecast to eject east-northeastward
into the central High Plains and Black Hills vicinity during the
mid-late evening.  Concurrently, an upper ridge over the eastern
half of the Great Plains states will shift eastward over the MS
Valley towards daybreak Monday.  

Late morning surface analysis shows a developing low centered over
southeast WY with a lee trough/dryline extending southward through
the southern High Plains.  The cyclone will deepen near the WY/NE/CO
border through early evening before developing northeast into
central SD late tonight.  

...Southeast MT...Western Dakotas...
A sharpening lee trough is forecast by late this afternoon amidst
appreciable heating and moistening, especially across western SD. 
Model guidance shows a narrow plume of 500-2000 J/kg MLCAPE (highest
over SD) developing by mid-late afternoon as large-scale ascent
begins to overspread the region.  Isolated to widely scattered
thunderstorms are forecast to develop from the northern NE Panhandle
to the Black Hills, and north of the developing low over southeast
MT by late afternoon.  The stronger storms will gradually move into
richer moisture with an accompanying risk for mainly large hail and
severe gusts.  Gradual cooling during the evening will favor a
transition to elevated storms evolving with time as a LLJ
strengthens tonight.  A severe risk will probably develop farther
east in association with WAA into parts of the eastern Dakotas and
MN late.

...Central/Southern High Plains...
Visible-satellite imagery indicates a very moist boundary layer with
a mix of a cumulus field across central and north TX and eastern
NM/CO and stratus from the TX Caprock northward through OK to NE. 
The depth and quality of moisture sampled by the 12z Midland,
Amarillo, and Dodge City raobs is considered seasonably moisture
rich, and is located beneath an elevated mixed layer.  Additional
moistening through advection and evaporation will contribute to 60s
dewpoints east of a dryline/lee trough by late afternoon.  Strong
heating is forecast near the dryline from western NE southward
through West TX, which will result in a weakly capped but moderate
to very unstable airmass by 21z.  Large-scale forcing for ascent
across the region will be nebulous, but low-level convergence along
the dryline amid little to no convective inhibition may result in
convective initiation. 

With dryline convergence as the mechanism for convective initiation,
predictability is low.  Dryline circulations will likely be
strongest across the TX Panhandle/West TX where temperatures west of
the dryline will be warmest, but low-level convergence will likely
maximize in the CO/NE/KS border intersection vicinity near a
developing surface low.  As a result, these two areas may have a
greater risk for thunderstorms (isolated, widely spaced storm
coverage) late this afternoon into the evening. 

The overall environment will be very supportive of supercells with
any storms that do form, with large to very large hail as the
primary risk initially. If any storms manage to develop and become
sustained, a strengthening low-level jet will support a tornado
threat during the evening with any storms that persist (or develop
along the retreating dryline).  Nocturnal cooling and increased CINH
by mid to late evening will act to eventually weaken storm activity
in this region.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0745 AM CDT Sun Apr 27 2025

Valid 271300Z - 281200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR MUCH OF THE
GREAT PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated to scattered severe thunderstorms are possible on Sunday
evening into early morning Monday across parts of the Great Plains.
Large hail, severe gusts, and a few tornadoes are all possible.

...Synopsis...
Early morning satellite imagery shows modest upper ridging between 
a pair of well-defined cyclones, one centered over NV and the other
centered over northern NY/VT. The NV cyclone forecast to shift
slightly eastward throughout the day as a shortwave trough, and
associated jet streak, rotate through its base. Moderate to strong
southwesterly flow associated with this shortwave will spread
northeastward from the Southwest into central Plains and Mid MO
Valley. 

Recent surface analysis reveals an expansive area of high pressure
centered over the Upper Great Lakes covering much of the eastern
CONUS. A broad area of low pressure exists over the intermountain
West, with several embedded lows. A tight surface pressure gradient
exists between these two features across the Plains, and the
resultant moderate low-level flow will contribute to northward
moisture advection throughout the period.

Any large-scale forcing for ascent associated with the shortwave
progressing around the NV cyclone will remain west of this better
low-level moisture (and associated buoyancy) until later tonight,
when it reaches the northern High Plains. Ample buoyancy and
moisture will exist across the central and southern High Plains, but
the lack of stronger large-scale forcing for ascent will result in a
more conditional severe thunderstorm potential.

...Southeast MT...Western Dakotas...
A deepening lee trough is forecast to result in surface cyclogenesis
in the far eastern MT/WY border vicinity by late this afternoon.
Strong boundary-layer mixing is anticipated across the region,
promoting airmass destabilization but also likely keeping dewpoints
in the 40s across much of the region. Convergence along several
boundaries across the region, including a surface trough extending
across southeast MT and the lee trough along the eastern WY border
vicinity, amid this destabilized airmass will result in thunderstorm
development, particularly during the late afternoon/early evening as
increasing large-scale ascent complements the low-level convergence.

An eastward storm motion should take any storms that develop in
better low-level moisture over time, with a strengthening low-level
jet helping to maintain favorably moist low-level inflow. Even with
this modest improvement in thermodynamics, nocturnal stabilization 
should result in storms becoming more elevated over time. Primary
threat across this region are large hail and damaging gusts. 

...Central/Southern High Plains...
Mid 60s dewpoints are already in place across the Permian Basin and
the general expectation is for low-level moisture to increase
throughout the day. 60s dewpoints will likely be in place across all
but far western KS by 21Z and into much of central NE by 00Z. Strong
heating is anticipated across this region as well, resulting in an
area of moderate to strong buoyancy from southwest NE into west TX
by the late afternoon. Large-scale forcing for ascent across the
region will be nebulous, but low-level convergence along the dryline
amid little to no convective inhibition may result in convective
initiation. 

With dryline convergence as the mechanism for convective initiation,
predictability is low and convection-allowing guidance has limited
utility. Dryline circulations will likely be strongest across the TX
Panhandle/West TX where temperatures west of the dryline will be
warmest, but low-level coverage will likely maximize in the CO/NE/KS
border intersection vicinity near a developing surface low. As a
result, these two areas may have a greater risk for thunderstorms
today. 

The overall environment will be very supportive of supercells with
any storms that do form, with large to very large hail as the
primary risk initially. Strong downdrafts are possible as well. A
westward shift of the dryline and strengthening low-level jet will
support an increase tornado threat during the evening with any
storms that persist (or develop along the retreating dryline). The
kinematic environment improves notably across the TX Panhandle,
western KS, and western NE between 00Z and 06Z, so any storms that
are ongoing may be able to organize considerably before eventually
weakening due to nocturnal stabilization.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0250 PM CDT Sat Apr 26 2025

Areas affected...parts of sern OK...nern TX...swrn AR...nwrn LA

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 261950Z - 262145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Ongoing thunderstorm development is likely to continue to
intensify through 4-6 PM CDT, including a couple of supercells
posing a risk for severe hail, locally strong surface gusts, and
perhaps a brief tornado or two.

DISCUSSION...The early day convective cluster has generally
weakened, with at least a couple of remnant mesoscale circulations
continuing to migrate northeastward and eastward into/across parts
of south central Kansas and northeastern Oklahoma.  The Rapid
Refresh indicates that there is a lingering pocket of relatively
cold mid-level air (-12 to -13C around 500 mb), associated with a
low-amplitude short wave perturbation overspreading the Red River
Valley vicinity, within moderate westerly mid/upper flow.  It
appears that this is supporting an increase in thunderstorm
development west-northwest of Durant toward the Ark-La-Tex vicinity.

The more recent convection is focused along a diffuse near surface
baroclinic zone within weak surface troughing, where inflow
emanating from a seasonably moist boundary layer characterized by
CAPE in excess of 2000 J/kg seems likely to support further
intensification into late afternoon.  This may include supercell
structures with potential to produce severe hail.  Low-level
hodographs are generally forecast to remain modest, but a brief
tornado might not be out of the question.

Mesoscale Discussion 0569
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0228 PM CDT Sat Apr 26 2025

Areas affected...Portions of eastern New Mexico into the Trans-Pecos

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 261928Z - 262130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Large to very-large hail and perhaps a tornado or two are
possible with supercells near an outflow boundary this
afternoon/evening. A watch may eventually be needed. Convective
trends will be monitored.

DISCUSSION...With continuing convection within Oklahoma and western
North Texas, outflow has continued to push west/southwestward into
eastern New Mexico and through the South Plains. While a few
towering cumulus have been observed along this outflow boundary
during the afternoon, residence time within the zone of ascent has
been too short to promote deep convection. Farther to the west,
southeasterly winds have pushed mid/upper 50s F dewpoints into the
southern Rockies. Convection has been slowly deepening per day cloud
phase imagery. The most likely scenario is for a few storms to
develop within the next 2-3 hours and propagate east-southeastward
as the outflow boundary pushes up against the terrain.

With 1000-2000 J/kg MLCAPE near and just behind the outflow boundary
(where it has remained cloud free) and 30-40 kts of effective shear
across the boundary, supercells would likely be the dominant storm
mode. Steep mid-level lapse rates sampled in this mornings observed
soundings in the region suggest large to very-large hail would be
possible along with isolated severe gusts. The tornado threat is
somewhat less certain given what will at least initially be weak
low-level winds. However, backed surface winds along/near the
outflow boundary will provide greater SRH for storms that favorably
interact with it. There will be a modest increase in the low-level
jet this evening, but, given the more stable conditions with
eastward extent, the spatial window for greater tornado potential
appears limited/conditional. Convective trends will continue to be
monitored. A watch may eventually be needed, but timing remains
uncertain.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0348 AM CDT Sat Apr 26 2025

Valid 291200Z - 041200Z

...DISCUSSION...
...Day 4/Tuesday - West Texas to the Northeast...
Moderate instability will be present along an elongated frontal zone
from the southern Plains to the Northeast on Tuesday. Modest shear
along the frontal zone will support some organization into multicell
clusters and perhaps supercells. A greater severe weather threat
will exist across the eastern Great Lakes where forcing and shear
will be strongest as a 75 knot mid-level jet streak crosses southern
Ontario. 

Another focused zone of greater coverage of severe storms will be
across parts of West Texas where multiple rounds of storm are
anticipated. The first chance of storms will be during the afternoon
as the front continues to move south across Oklahoma and perhaps
into North Texas. An additional round of storms will be possible
across parts of West Texas as the low-level jet strengthens Tuesday
night in the presence of strong instability and shear. 

...Day 5/Wednesday - North Texas to the ArkLaTex...
Ongoing Day 4 convection may have some impact on the exact location
of the severe weather threat on Tuesday. However, regardless of Day
4 convective evolution, there will likely be a region with a more
focused severe weather threat on Day 5/Wednesday where moderate to
strong instability exists ahead of strengthening mid-level flow and
a mid-level trough which will move across the southern Plains. 15%
probabilities have been added for Day 5 from North Texas to the
ArkLaTex where this location of greatest severe weather threat
appears most likely at this time.

Mesoscale Discussion 0561
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0344 PM CDT Fri Apr 25 2025

Areas affected...the Trans-Pecos and Permian Basin

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 173...

Valid 252044Z - 252215Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 173
continues.

SUMMARY...A localized very large hail threat should be confined to
the Trans-Pecos and adjacent Pecos Valley into early evening.

DISCUSSION...A slow-moving supercell has been drifting east, west of
Fort Stockton. Additional storm-development appears likely to be
delayed until early evening or later based on recent visible
satellite and HRRR trends. 19Z observed sounding at Midland sampled
weak 0-3 km shear/SRH, limiting low-level hodograph curvature.
Still, adequate speed shear through the buoyancy layer will support
large to very large hail potential with the supercell or two that
anchor near the higher terrain. As low-level southeasterlies
increase in the next few hours, additional storms may develop north
into far southeast NM.

Mesoscale Discussion 0560
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0319 PM CDT Fri Apr 25 2025

Areas affected...the TX South Plains

Concerning...Tornado Watch 172...

Valid 252019Z - 252145Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 172 continues.

SUMMARY...Greatest potential for a slow-moving, long-lived intense
supercell will be across the Texas South Plains portion of WW 172,
along a largely west/east-oriented outflow boundary.

DISCUSSION...Initial sustained supercell development has been
drifting east over Bailey County, with additional incipient cells to
its east towards Plainview. Surface/low-level convergence will
remain maximized near the TX/NM border over the next couple hours,
which should support further intensification of this ongoing
activity. With only around 20-kts of 0-3 km shear per the Lubbock
VWP, very large hail should remain the overarching threat in the
near term, potentially reaching baseball to softball size. But
strengthening of low-level east-southeasterlies should commence in
the next couple hours. A corresponding increase in tornado potential
is expected into early evening with ingest of mid 60s surface dew
points from the Low Rolling Plains. Given weak large-scale ascent,
convection should remain discrete enough into this time frame to
support potential for a strong tornado in the most intense/mature
supercell anchored along the mesoscale outflow boundary.

Mesoscale Discussion 0559
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0219 PM CDT Fri Apr 25 2025

Areas affected...Central/eastern Kentucky into southern Ohio

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 251919Z - 252115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...An isolated strong/potentially damaging wind gust could
occur this afternoon. A watch is not needed.

DISCUSSION...Convection has developed within an area of thinner
cirrus canopy in central Kentucky. This is occurring in response to
a weak shortwave in the Midwest. Modest effective shear of around 25
kts could promote a stronger storm or two. Enhanced 850 mb winds
ahead of the surface low/cold front will allow few
stronger/potentially damaging winds to mix to the surface in the
most intense storms. Furthermore, weak but sufficient low-level
hodograph curvature is noted in KLVX/KJKL VAD data. It is possible a
storm or two could exhibit weak low-level rotation. However, tornado
potential is low. Additionally, low/mid-level lapse rates and
mid/upper-level wind shear are all weak. Any severe threat that
develops will be spatially limited and marginal.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 172
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
155 PM CDT Fri Apr 25 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Eastern New Mexico
  Texas Panhandle and South Plains

* Effective this Friday afternoon and evening from 155 PM until
  1000 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A few tornadoes and a couple intense tornadoes possible
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 4
    inches in diameter likely
  Isolated damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...Scattered thunderstorms are forecast to develop this
afternoon and evening.  Once storms develop, the stronger storms
will likely evolve into intense supercells capable of large to giant
hail.  The risk for tornadoes will probably maximize late this
afternoon into the evening as low-level winds strengthen.  A strong
tornado is possible.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 85 statute miles
north and south of a line from 55 miles south southwest of Cannon
Afb NM to 25 miles northeast of Childress TX. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU2).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 4 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 60 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 550. Mean
storm motion vector 27010.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 173
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
240 PM CDT Fri Apr 25 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Southeast New Mexico
  West Texas

* Effective this Friday afternoon and evening from 240 PM until
  1000 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 3
    inches in diameter likely
  Isolated damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Isolated thunderstorms are forecast to develop and
intensify this afternoon into the evening.  Initially storms will
likely focus near the higher terrain but will eventually move east
into lower elevations.  The stronger storms will likely become
supercells with both left and right splitting supercells possible. 
Large to very large hail will be the primary risk with these storms.
 A tornado is possible during the early evening as low-level winds
strengthen.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 60
statute miles east and west of a line from 55 miles east northeast
of Carlsbad NM to 45 miles southwest of Fort Stockton TX. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU3).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

Mesoscale Discussion 0544
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0345 PM CDT Thu Apr 24 2025

Areas affected...eastern Colorado

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 242045Z - 242245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Some instances of severe hail and gusty winds possible
this afternoon/evening.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorm activity is ongoing near and south of the
Denver metro this afternoon. Moisture in this region is limited,
with dew points in the upper 40s to 50s. Nonetheless, ongoing
convection will have potential to produce instances of mainly
sub-severe hail given steep lapse rates and cooling aloft. 

As this development and any additional development shifts further
south and east, it will enter a region with temperatures in the low
to mid 70s and dew points in the low to mid-50s near the CO/KS
border MLCAPE around 500-1000 J/kg and deep layer shear around 30-35
kts is observed in surface objective analysis as of 20z. This
environment may support some increase in coverage and intensity,
with better potential for severe hail and wind. Trends will be
monitored for potential watch issuance this evening.

Mesoscale Discussion 0543
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0233 PM CDT Thu Apr 24 2025

Areas affected...parts of cntrl and sern TX

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 241933Z - 242130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...A cluster of thunderstorms continues to organize, with
signs of increasing potential to produce strong to severe gusts
while propagating southeastward toward the mid/upper Texas coastal
plain through 5-7 PM CDT.

DISCUSSION...Forcing for ascent associated with
lower/mid-tropospheric warm advection, and southeasterly updraft
inflow of seasonably moist boundary-layer air (characterized by CAPE
in excess of 2000 J/Kg), have maintained vigorous thunderstorm
development.  Activity has undergone notable intensification and
increasing organization, and it appears that a meso-beta scale
cyclonic circulation is becoming better-defined near the Waco
vicinity, where a couple of 50+ kt surface gusts have recently been
observed.  

Despite continued gradual warming around 700 mb, and some suggestion
that the larger-scale forcing for ascent may weaken, the
boundary-layer ahead of the storms remains potentially supportive of
further intensification of the convective system, southeastward
toward the mid/upper Texas coastal plain into early evening. 
Deep-layer mean flow and shear remain generally modest, as does the
strength of the surface cold pool (as of 19Z observational data). 
However, with further strengthening of the mesoscale vortex and
west-northwesterly rear inflow, there remains potential for a
continued increase in risk for strong to severe gusts during the
next few hours.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 167
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
335 PM CDT Thu Apr 24 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Oklahoma Panhandle
  Texas Panhandle and South Plains

* Effective this Thursday afternoon and evening from 335 PM until
  1100 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A couple tornadoes possible
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 4
    inches in diameter likely
  Isolated damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...Widely scattered thunderstorms are forecast to rapidly
develop this afternoon into the early evening.  Environmental shear
and buoyancy combinations strongly favor intense, discrete
supercells.  Large to giant hail will be probable with any
supercell.  The tornado risk will likely focus for a few hours
during the early evening near a residual outflow boundary draped
over parts of the Watch area.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 60 statute miles
east and west of a line from 30 miles northeast of Guymon OK to 60
miles southeast of Lubbock TX. For a complete depiction of the watch
see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU7).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 166...

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 4 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 60 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 550. Mean
storm motion vector 29015.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 166
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
255 PM CDT Thu Apr 24 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Central into East Texas

* Effective this Thursday afternoon and evening from 255 PM until
  800 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...A linear cluster of strong to severe thunderstorms will
likely continue east across much of the Watch area this afternoon
into the early evening.  Severe gusts 60-70 mph appear to be the
primary hazard, but large hail may accompany the stronger cells on
the southwestern flank of the thunderstorm band.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 50
statute miles north and south of a line from 35 miles west of Temple
TX to 25 miles east of Lufkin TX. For a complete depiction of the
watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU6).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

Mesoscale Discussion 0539
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0637 AM CDT Thu Apr 24 2025

Areas affected...Central and North Texas...Southern Oklahoma

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 241137Z - 241400Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...A severe threat may continue across parts of central and
north Texas this morning. Isolated severe gusts and hail will be the
primary threats. The potential for weather watch issuance is low.

DISCUSSION...Mosaic radar imagery shows a line of strong
thunderstorms located from southern Oklahoma into north Texas, with
a linear cluster extending southward into central Texas. The storms
are located near a moist axis where surface dewpoints are in the mid
to upper 60s F. Across the moist airmass, the RAP is estimating
MLCAPE in the 1000 to 1500 J/kg range. The instability, combined
with large-scale ascent ahead of a shortwave trough and warm
advection are supporting the storms. In addition, the FWS WSR-88D
VWP has 0-6 km shear has 30 to 35 knots with some directional shear
in the low to mid-levels. This shear environment should be enough to
continue an isolated wind-damage and hail threat. The severe threat
may increase locally over the next hour or two, as the cells to the
south merge with the line to the north.

Mesoscale Discussion 0528
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0239 PM CDT Wed Apr 23 2025

Areas affected...parts of wrn KS...sern CO...OK Pnhdl

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 231939Z - 232215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Intensifying thunderstorm development appears increasingly
probable through the 4-6 PM CDT time frame, including the potential
for supercells posing a risk for large hail and tornadoes in a
focused area near/southeast of Goodland.

DISCUSSION...With daytime heating and mixing, the boundary-layer
within surface troughing across the Texas/Oklahoma Panhandle
vicinity through western Kansas continues to deepen and destabilize.
It now appears generally characterized by surface temperature/dew
point spreads in excess of 30 F, with CAPE increasing to 1500-2000+
J/kg.

Inhibition is in the process of weakening, and deepening high-based
convection is now evident within the axis of stronger
destabilization.  With further insolation, the initiation of
thunderstorms appears increasingly probable, some of which may
eventually be accompanied by small hail and localized strong
downbursts.

Of greater concern is the potential for convective development where
better low-level moisture, on the western periphery of outflow
associated with persistent ongoing convection across central Kansas,
intersects the axis of stronger heating.  This appears focused near
a weak developing cyclonic circulation southeast of Goodland, where
shear associated with clockwise turning of low-level wind fields
with height, beneath a belt of 30 kt westerly flow around 500 mb, is
likely sufficient for supercells.  This is where potential for large
hail appears maximized, and near-surface CAPE/upward vertical
accelerations may promote the potential for tornadoes.

Areas affected...far southwestern Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 231914Z - 232115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Risk for gusty winds and large hail possible this
afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Deepening cumulus is observed across the Davis
Mountains and ahead of the surface dryline across far western Texas.
Temperatures have warmed into the upper 70s to 80s which has led to
weakening of MLCIN across the region. Convective initiation should
occur in the next 1-2 hours. Ahead of the dryline, MLCAPE around
1000-2000 J/kg  with deep layer shear around 35-40 kts. This will
support supercells capable of large hail (some very large) and
damaging winds, given steep lapse rates around 8-9 C/km. A watch may
be needed in the coming hour.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0325 PM CDT Tue Apr 22 2025

Areas affected...portions of western Oklahoma...south-central Kansas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 222025Z - 222230Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Damaging wind and severe hail risk to increase through the
afternoon/evening.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorm activity has initiated and expected to
continue to form along the dryline across the Texas Panhandle this
afternoon. Additional thunderstorm development is expected across
the frontal boundary draped across western/central Kansas into the
Oklahoma Panhandle. Ahead of this development, the air mass across
western Oklahoma into central/eastern Kansas has been suppressed
owing to weak forcing and stout MLCIN most of the afternoon.
Temperatures are warming, with MLCIN eroding west to east across the
Texas Panhandle as temperatures have climbed into the 80s. Aloft
sounding analysis indicates, steep lapse rates and ample CAPE above
the 850 mb inversion.

Thunderstorm activity will gradually shift into this region by late
afternoon/evening. A mix of multi-cell clusters and embedded
supercells capable of large hail and damaging wind are expected. A
watch will likely be needed in the coming hours to cover this risk.

Mesoscale Discussion 0516
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0217 PM CDT Tue Apr 22 2025

Areas affected...southwestern Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 221917Z - 222115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Damaging wind and hail risk to increase through the
afternoon/evening.

DISCUSSION...Surface analysis shows the dryline extending across the
Texas Panhandle into far eastern New Mexico and southward to the
Texas Big Bend as on 19z. Daytime heating under mostly sunny skies
has led temperatures to rise into the 80s (some mid to upper 80s
further south near the Mexico border). Satellite data shows towering
cu, mainly near and adjacent to the higher terrain of the Cap Rock
and Stockton Plateau. Morning observed soundings from AMA and LUB
would suggest that convective temperatures are around 80-85 F, which
in combination with increase in towering cu suggests initiation over
the next 1-2 hours. 

Initial development will likely be supercellular. Though flow aloft
and deep layer shear are more marginal, MLCAPE around 1500-2500 J/kg
and steep low to mid-level lapse rates will support potential for
large hail (some very large 2"+) and damaging wind. Where discrete
modes can interact with outflow/boundaries enhancing surface
vorticity, a tornado could be possible. As storms increase in
coverage this afternoon, clustering along outflows will tend to
create mixed mode of supercells and multi-cells, with an increase in
potential for damaging wind (some 70-80 mph). A watch will be needed
to cover these threats soon.

Mesoscale Discussion 0515
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0214 PM CDT Tue Apr 22 2025

Areas affected...the South Carolina and North Carolina Piedmont

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 221914Z - 222145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Widely scattered thunderstorm activity may continue to
gradually develop and strengthen through 5-7 PM EDT, accompanied by
at least some risk for marginally severe hail and potentially
damaging surface gusts.  This may remain fairly localized and a
severe weather watch is not anticipated, but trends will continue to
be monitored.

DISCUSSION...Widely scattered thunderstorm development appears
underway, perhaps supported by subtle mid-level cooling on the
northwestern periphery of deep-layer ridging centered off the south
Atlantic coast.  Based on forecast soundings, destabilization for a
modestly moist and warming boundary layer remains inhibited by weak
high-level lapse rates.  However, CAPE within the mixed-phase layer
might still be sufficient to support small to marginally severe
hail, aided by favorable shear beneath a 40 kt southwesterly jet
streak around 500 mb.  

Lower-level wind fields will remain more modest, but with at least
some further boundary-layer destabilization through peak daytime
heating, scattered thunderstorm activity will probably continue to
intensify.  And downward mixing of momentum may lead to a few
potentially damaging wind gusts, before storms weaken this evening.

0130 PM CDT Tue Apr 22 2025

Areas affected...parts of cntrl/sern LA...srn MS...swrn/cntrl AL

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 221830Z - 222130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...A gradual increase in thunderstorm activity and intensity
appears probable through 4-6 PM CDT, with short-lived stronger
storms posing a risk for locally severe hail and wind gusts.

DISCUSSION...As low-amplitude mid-level troughing and more subtle
smaller-scale perturbations progress through weak (on the order of
10-20 kt) west-southwesterly mean flow across the Gulf Coast states,
associated forcing for ascent appears likely to contribute to
increasing thunderstorm development through 21-23Z.  Inhibition for
moist boundary-layer parcels (with dew points near 70F) is becoming 
increasingly negligible with continuing insolation, with modestly
steep lower/mid-tropospheric lapse rates contributing to CAPE around
1500-2000+ J/kg.  

Despite the rather modest to weak low-level and deep-layer shear,
thunderstorms are likely to continue to slowly intensify within the
destabilizing environment, into and beyond peak daytime heating. 
Stronger updraft pulses may eventually pose increasing potential to
produce severe hail and damaging downbursts.  As convection begins
to consolidate and become more widespread, this threat should
diminish, but strengthening convective outflow may continue to pose
potential for gusty/locally damaging winds into early evening.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 159
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
315 PM CDT Tue Apr 22 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  West Texas

* Effective this Tuesday afternoon and evening from 315 PM until
  1100 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 75
    mph likely
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2.5
    inches in diameter likely
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms will develop and increase in coverage
through the afternoon and evening across much of west Texas, in an
increasingly moist and unstable environment.  The strongest cells
are expected to produce large hail and damaging wind gusts.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 70
statute miles east and west of a line from 45 miles northeast of
Amarillo TX to 35 miles east of Dryden TX. For a complete depiction
of the watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS
WOU9).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 65 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
27025.

0246 PM CDT Sun Apr 20 2025

Areas affected...Northwest/north-central Arkansas into southern
Missouri

Concerning...Tornado Watch 154...

Valid 201946Z - 202115Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 154 continues.

SUMMARY...Storms moving into north-central Arkansas and southern
Missouri will pose a risk of tornadoes--some strong--and damaging
winds. There are signs of discrete storms within the line in
northwest/west-central Arkansas. These storms would bring the
greatest tornado risk.

DISCUSSION...KSRX radar imagery shows a few semi-discrete storms in
far western Arkansas. MRMS CAPPI data also shows these storms
intensifying. Mid-level ascent with southern extent will remain more
limited, but deep-layer shear vectors slightly more perpendicular to
the cold front will also favor discrete storms. VAD data from
KSGF/KLZK/KLSX all have shown an increase in low-level SRH over the
past couple of hours. This trend should continue, particularly in
Missouri. Supercell and QLCS tornadoes, some of which could be
strong, are all possible in this environment. Additionally, the more
linear convective elements will also pose a threat of wind damage.

Mesoscale Discussion 0502
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0220 PM CDT Sun Apr 20 2025

Areas affected...Eastern Missouri into western Illinois and far
southeastern Iowa

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 201920Z - 202115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...A tornado watch will be forthcoming for portions of
eastern Missouri into western Illinois and far southeastern Iowa, as
a warm frontal boundary continues to lift northward out of central
Missouri.

DISCUSSION...Breaks in cloud cover, along with a northward-lifting
surface warm frontal boundary, have resulted in continued
destabilization across eastern Missouri into western Illinois. With
mixed-layer CAPE forecast to exceed 1000 J/kg in the presence of
strong wind shear (and strong curvature of the low-level hodograph
in the vicinity of the front), the tornado threat is expected to
increase this afternoon into the evening hours. 

Ongoing storms along the MO/KS/OK borders are forecast to continue
north and east into the new watch area, with supercells embedded
within a largely linear complex. Any embedded supercells (especially
any within the vicinity of the warm front), as well as any
pre-frontal storms, will have access to an environment characterized
by strong low-level shear/streamwise vorticity supportive of tornado
development. Current VAD wind profiles from KLSX show 200 m^2/s^2 of
0-500m storm relative helicity -- nearly double what is shown in the
current SPC Mesoanalysis. Given the environmental support for
tornadoes, some of which may be strong, a tornado watch is
anticipated within the next hour or two.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 154
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1200 PM CDT Sun Apr 20 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of

miles west of Texarkana AR. For a complete depiction of the watch
see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU4).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&
