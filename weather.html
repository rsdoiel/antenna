Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0750 AM CDT Thu Jun 19 2025

Valid 191300Z - 201200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE MID-ATLANTIC...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE NORTHERN PLAINS/UPPER MIDWEST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are expected across much of the Mid-Atlantic
region today, and to a lesser extent into the Carolinas and over
portions of New England. Severe/damaging wind gusts are the primary
concern. An isolated large hail threat should also develop across
parts of the northern Plains/Upper Midwest, primarily during the
evening/overnight hours.

...New England/Mid-Atlantic into North Carolina...
An upper trough will move eastward today from the Great Lakes/OH
Valley across the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast. Seasonably strong
southwesterly mid-level flow around 40-50 kt will accompany this
upper trough passage, and aid in sufficient deep-layer shear for
organized severe thunderstorms across these regions. Recent visible
satellite imagery and surface observations show mostly clear skies
and a moist low-level airmass already in place from the Appalachians
towards the Mid-Atlantic Coast. Ample diurnal heating through this
afternoon should support moderate to locally strong instability
across much of the Mid-Atlantic, with somewhat weaker instability
with northward extent into interior New England.

Current expectations are for multiple cells/clusters to initially
form over the higher terrain of the Appalachians/Blue Ridge
Mountains by early to mid afternoon, and subsequently spread
east-northward to the coast through the afternoon and evening. Given
steepened low-level lapse rates and enhanced low/mid-level flow
associated with the upper trough, scattered to potentially numerous
severe/damaging winds will likely be the primary threat with this
convection. The greatest concentration of wind damage should be
focused across parts of the Mid-Atlantic, where the Enhanced Risk
has been maintained with only minor expansion. Otherwise, isolated
hail may also occur with any of the more cellular convection, even
though mid-level lapse rates are not forecast to be overly steep. A
brief tornado or two also appears possible, although low-level winds
will generally be veered to west-southwesterly, limiting 0-1 km SRH.

...Southeast...
A band of thunderstorms is ongoing this morning across parts of the
Mid-South/Southeast. This activity has generally remained sub-severe
overnight, and on the southern periphery of an upper trough to the
north. With strong daytime heating of a rather moist low-level
airmass in place to its south and modest deep-layer shear for
updraft organization, there is some opportunity for this convection
to either restrengthen through the afternoon as it spreads
southward, or for redevelopment to occur along its outflow. Have
adjusted the Marginal Risk for damaging winds based on the current
position of ongoing thunderstorms, and their potential to move
southward across parts of the Southeast/central Gulf Coast states
this afternoon/early evening before eventually weakening near the
Gulf Coast.

...Northern Plains/Upper Midwest...
Upper ridging will be maintained today over much of the Rockies and
High Plains. This will tend to suppress convective development for
much of the day. Still, a weak mid-level shortwave trough will move
from western Canada across the Canadian Prairie provinces today,
eventually reaching parts of the northern Plains and Upper Midwest
tonight. This feature, along with increasing low-level warm/moist
advection associated with a strengthening southwesterly low-level
jet across the northern/central Plains this evening, may be
sufficient to aid at least isolated robust thunderstorm development
tonight generally along and north of a surface boundary. Strong
MUCAPE, steep lapse rates aloft, and ample deep-layer shear would
likely support supercells with associated threat for large hail in a
favorable northwesterly mid/upper-level flow regime. There is still
some uncertainty with the placement and overall coverage of these
supercells tonight, but based on latest guidance trends the Slight
Risk has been expanded eastward to include more of central/eastern
MN and western/northern WI. Isolated damaging winds may also occur
if an MCS is able to develop, although this remains highly
uncertain.

...Central Plains...
Moderate to strong instability is forecast to develop this afternoon
across parts of the central Plains along/east of surface lee
troughing. Even though deep-layer shear and forcing aloft will not
be as pronounced as farther north, there appears to be some chance
for high-based convection to develop and pose an isolated hail/wind
threat.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 600 AM CST (1200 UTC), the center of Hurricane Erick was located 
along the coast of Mexico near latitude 16.3 North, longitude 98.3 
West, just east of Punta Maldonado.  Erick is moving toward the 
northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h), and this general motion is expected 
to continue through tonight.  On the forecast track, the center of 
Erick is expected to move inland over southern Mexico throughout 
the day.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 125 mph (205 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Erick is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson 
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Erick is expected to rapidly weaken over the 
mountains of Mexico, and the system is likely to dissipate tonight 
or early Friday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90
miles (150 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 950 mb (28.05 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Erick can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP5 and WMO header
WTPZ45 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Erick will produce rainfall totals of 8 to 12 inches, with
maximum totals of 16 inches, across the Mexican states of Oaxaca and
Guerrero. This rainfall will lead to life-threatening flooding and
mudslides, especially in areas of steep terrain. Rainfall totals of
2 to 4 inches, with maximum totals of 6 inches, are expected across
the Mexican states of Chiapas, Michoacan, Colima and Jalisco.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with Erick,
please see the National Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep5.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning 
area during the next few hours, with destructive winds near the core 
of Erick.  Hurricane conditions are possible in the hurricane watch 
area today.  Tropical storm conditions are ongoing in the tropical 
storm warning area.  Wind speeds atop and on the windward sides of 
hills and mountains are often up to 30 percent stronger than the 
near-surface winds indicated in this advisory, and in some elevated 
locations could be even greater.
 
STORM SURGE: A dangerous, life-threatening storm surge is expected
to produce coastal flooding near and to the east of where the center
crosses the coast, in areas of onshore winds.  The surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Erick will continue affecting the coast of 
southern Mexico throughout the day.  These swells are likely to 
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please 
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Hurricane Erick Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052025
300 AM CST Thu Jun 19 2025
 
Erick is about to make landfall along the southern coast of Mexico. 
Its rapid strengthening episode has ended, likely due to the 
interaction with land.  The eye has become obscured on satellite 
imagery, and the intensity is adjusted to 120 kt in agreement with 
the latest objective estimates from UW/CIMSS.  Erick remains an 
extremely dangerous category 4 hurricane.  However, rapid weakening 
will occur after the center moves inland and the system moves over 
the mountainous terrain of Mexico.

Smoothing out the trochoidal wobbles in the track, the motion 
estimate, 310/8 kt, remains about the same as before.  This general 
motion, on the south side of a weak mid-level ridge, is likely to 
continue until the system dissipates within the next day or two.  
The official track forecast is just slightly west of the previous 
one and close to the latest corrected consensus, HCCA, guidance.
  
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Erick is an extremely dangerous category 4 hurricane, and
devastating wind damage is likely near its core. Take shelter in 
the interior portion of a well-built structure and remain sheltered 
until after hazardous conditions pass.

2. Erick will produce heavy rainfall across portions of Southwest 
Mexico through this week. Life-threatening flooding and mudslides 
are likely, especially in areas of steep terrain.

3. A dangerous, life-threatening storm surge is expected to produce
coastal flooding near and to the east of where the center crosses
the coast, in areas of onshore winds.  The surge will be accompanied
by large and destructive waves.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0345 AM CDT Thu Jun 19 2025

Valid 221200Z - 271200Z

...DISCUSSION...
...D4/Sunday...
The upper-level trough over the West is forecast to take on more of
a positive tilt on Sunday, as an embedded shortwave and attendant
midlevel jet maximum move across the northern Rockies/High Plains.
As this occurs, a surface low is forecast to move from SD toward the
upper Great Lakes, as a trailing cold front moves through the
northern/central Plains. Guidance varies regarding frontal timing,
though generally agrees that stronger mid/upper-level flow will tend
to lag behind the front. 

While details remain uncertain, strong to potentially severe storms
may develop near/north of the surface low across parts of the
Dakotas/MN, and also along the trailing cold front into the central
Plains. 

...D5/Monday - D8/Thursday...
The upper ridge across the Southeast is expected to remain in place
through at least early next week, with some guidance suggesting
potential for deamplification by the middle of the week. Multiple
shortwaves may emerge from the persistent (though weakening) western
trough through at least Wednesday, resulting in some potential for
strong to severe storms along the periphery of the upper ridge from
the Plains into the upper Midwest and Great Lakes, and possibly
parts of the Northeast. However, predictability remains quite low
regarding the details of any organized severe threats during this
time frame.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0209 AM CDT Thu Jun 19 2025

Valid 201200Z - 211200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR MUCH OF THE GREAT BASIN INTO THE
SOUTHWEST...

...Synopsis...
A robust midlevel low will advance eastward across the Northwest
during the day, while a swath of strong deep-layer westerly flow
overspreads much of the western CONUS. In response, surface low
pressure will deepen over the northern Great Basin, promoting a
tightening pressure gradient across the Great Basin into the
Southwest. This large-scale pattern will support widespread critical
fire-weather conditions across the Great Basin into the Southwest. 

...Great Basin into the Southwest...
Strong diurnal heating amid a dry antecedent air mass will support
another day of widespread single-digit RH across the region. At the
same time, deep boundary-layer mixing into the strong flow aloft,
combined with the tightening pressure gradient, will yield an
expansive area of 20-30 mph sustained southwesterly surface winds.
Given increasingly dry fuels across much of the Great Basin into the
Southwest, widespread critical fire-weather conditions are expected,
with localized extremely critical conditions possible over
terrain-favored areas. 

...Southern CA into the San Joaquin Valley...
Deep-layer west-northwesterly flow on the upstream-side of the
midlevel low will overspread central and southern CA, where the
tight regional pressure gradient will be in place. This will promote
breezy/gusty surface winds primarily over the interior mountains and
valley -- where 15-20 percent RH is expected. These dry/breezy
conditions will favor elevated fire-weather conditions where fuels
are receptive to wildfire spread.

Mesoscale Discussion 1351
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0308 PM CDT Wed Jun 18 2025

Areas affected...southern IN...far northern KY/southwest OH

Concerning...Tornado Watch 434...435...

Valid 182008Z - 182145Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 434, 435 continues.

SUMMARY...Damaging wind and a couple tornadoes remain possible with
the southern portion of a QLCS and broken convection to its south.
Downstream watch issuance will be likely east of WWs 434/435 by
early evening.

DISCUSSION...The slower-moving but yet progressive southern-portion
of the QLCS will likely spread across southern IN into early
evening. More broken, semi-discrete convection persists to its south
and these cells may help refine its southern edge along the IN/KY
border. The IND VWP indicates still adequate low-level SRH for a
supercell tornado. Most cells have struggled to more deeply
intensify despite the ample buoyancy, likely due to development
ahead of the weak surface front amid marginal mid-level lapse rates
and the MCV tracking towards northern IN. Sporadic severe wind gusts
should remain the primary hazard.

Mesoscale Discussion 1350
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0239 PM CDT Wed Jun 18 2025

Areas affected...Portions of southern Oklahoma into the eastern
South Plains of Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 181939Z - 182145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Large hail (isolated hail greater than 2 inches) and
severe wind gusts will be possible with storms developing on an
outflow boundary. The tornado threat is low, but nonzero,
conditional upon favorable storm interactions with the boundary. A
watch is possible for parts of Northwest Texas into southern
Oklahoma.

DISCUSSION...Surface observations and visible satellite over the
past several hours have indicated that an outflow boundary from
morning convection has slowly shifted north into southern Oklahoma
this afternoon. A weak surface low is also evident in far southwest
Oklahoma, very near the Red River. Given the amount of
destabilization that has occurred and the stronger convergence near
the surface low, it seems likely that a few storms will eventually
develop later this afternoon. With the upper-level trough moving
eastward, only modestly enhanced mid-level winds will remain. As
such, effective shear (30-35 kts) will only be marginally supportive
of supercells. However, steep mid-level lapse rates (7.8 C/km on the
18Z observed OUN sounding) and large buoyancy (3000+ J/kg MLCAPE)
will support a threat for large/very-large hail and severe wind
gusts. Coverage of hail greater than 2 inches may only be isolated
given weak anvil-level flow. The tornado threat appears low on
account of weak low-level winds, but a storm interacting with the
outflow boundary would be capable of tornado in that mesoscale
environment.

Mesoscale Discussion 1349
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0238 PM CDT Wed Jun 18 2025

Areas affected...northern IN...southern Lower MI...northwest OH

Concerning...Tornado Watch 434...

Valid 181938Z - 182145Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 434 continues.

SUMMARY...Northern, fast-moving portion of a QLCS should progress
across the rest of northern Indiana into southern Lower Michigan and
northwest Ohio through early evening. Damaging winds should be the
main threat, but a tornado or two will be possible. Downstream watch
issuance expected by 21Z.

DISCUSSION...The northern portion of a QLCS has been steadily
progressing east around 45 kts with a history of estimated to
measured gusts of 55-70 mph. This fast-moving portion of the line
has likely outpaced stronger low-level shear across southwest IN,
per comparison of VWX and IWX VWP data. Given largely veered surface
winds downstream and recent HRRR guidance, an outflow-dominated line
will likely persist as it spreads into southern Lower MI and
northwest OH through early evening. Damaging winds should remain the
primary hazard, with a tornado or two possible in any QLCS
mesovortices across northern IN.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 437
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
450 PM EDT Wed Jun 18 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Southeast Indiana
  Northern Kentucky
  Southwest Ohio

* Effective this Wednesday afternoon and evening from 450 PM
  until 1000 PM EDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging winds likely with isolated significant gusts
    to 75 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...A fast moving line of thunderstorms over Indiana will
track eastward this afternoon and evening.  Damaging winds along the
leading edge of the storms is the primary risk.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 70
statute miles east and west of a line from 55 miles northwest of
Columbus OH to 45 miles south of Cincinnati OH. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU7).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 432...WW 433...WW
434...WW 435...WW 436...

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
1.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 65 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
26035.

Hurricane Erick Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052025
300 PM CST Wed Jun 18 2025

An Air Force Reconnaissance aircraft completed its mission into 
Erick this morning and found 93-kt flight-level winds at 700 mb 
along with a dropsonde central pressure of 971 mb around 17Z.  The 
recon data showed strengthening in between the 1530Z fix and the 17Z 
fix.  An eye has been present in visible and infrared satellite 
imagery since about 15Z this morning, and recent satellite imagery 
shows the eye continuing to become more circular with warming eye 
temperatures.  The eye is nearly completely surrounded by a large 
area of convective cloud tops colder than -70C.  As a result, 
satellite intensity estimates have been increasing quickly.  The 
18Z subjective Dvorak estimates from TAFB and SAB range from 90-102 
kt.  Recent objective intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS are in the 
95-100 kt range.  Based on a blend of the data, the initial 
intensity is estimated to be 95 kt, and this might be a bit 
conservative.
 
The initial motion estimate is northwestward, or 315/8 kt.  This 
general motion, along with perhaps a slight acceleration, is 
expected through landfall, which is forecast to occur early Thursday 
morning along the southern coast of Mexico.  Erick has been moving 
to the right of the previous official forecast, and as a result, 
the new guidance shows landfall slightly to the east of the 
previous track.  The new NHC track forecast is shifted eastward, 
close to the latest TVCE and HCCA consensus aids.  Confidence in 
the track forecast is high.

Erick has been rapidly strengthening for the past 12 hours, and 
given the extremely favorable atmospheric and oceanic conditions 
along Erick's forecast track, further intensification in the short 
term appears very likely.  The 12Z HAFS models and the 18Z SHIPS 
guidance have Erick becoming a major hurricane soon.  The various 
SHIPS Rapid Intensification indices all show greater than a 70 
percent chance of 20 kt strengthening in the next 12 h.  The new 
NHC forecast shows 110 kt at 12 h, which is at the high end of the 
intensity guidance suite.  There is a possibility that Erick could 
strengthen more than forecast.

The next Air Force Reconnaissance aircraft is scheduled to be in 
the hurricane in a few hours, around 2330 UTC today.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Erick continues to rapidly intensify and is expected to be a 
major hurricane when it reaches the coast of western Oaxaca or 
eastern Guerrero within the hurricane warning area late tonight or 
early Thursday.  Devastating wind damage is possible where the core 
of the storm moves onshore.  Weather conditions are already 
deteriorating, and preparations to protect life and property should 
be rushed to completion before sunset.
 
2. Erick will produce heavy rainfall across portions of Central
America and Southwest Mexico through this week.  Life-threatening
flooding and mudslides are likely, especially in areas of steep

RAINFALL: Erick will produce rainfall totals of 8 to 12 inches, with 
maximum totals of 16 inches, across the Mexican states of Oaxaca and 
Guerrero. This rainfall will lead to life-threatening flooding and 
mudslides, especially in areas of steep terrain. Rainfall totals of 
2 to 4 inches, with maximum totals of 6 inches, are expected across 
the Mexican states of Chiapas, Michoacan, Colima and Jalisco.

Day 1 Convective Outlook

0255 PM CDT Wed Jun 18 2025

Valid 182000Z - 191200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
MIDWEST AND LOWER GREAT LAKES...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE MID
ATLANTIC REGION...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are expected this afternoon and evening from
parts of southeast Missouri northeastward to the southern Great
Lakes. Scattered to numerous damaging winds, isolated large hail,
and tornadoes all appear possible. Severe thunderstorms with
damaging winds may also develop across parts of the Mid-Atlantic.

...20z Update Midwest and Great Lakes...
A well-developed QLCS with multiple embedded bows and recent
measured severe gusts will continue eastward across IN and southern
lower MI this afternoon before reaching western OH this evening.
Moderate buoyancy and enhanced upper-level shear will support
continued storm organization with damaging gusts likely. Embedded
mesovorticies will also pose a risk for a few tornadoes. The main
changes to the outlook where to trim the Enhanced behind the
advancing QLCS.

Farther west near the core of the MCV, several clusters of miniature
supercells have a history of producing tornadoes. This may continue
for a couple more hours as storms near the MCV remain in 100-200
J/kg of low-level buoyancy and strong ambient vorticity. The
eastward extent of this threat is unclear as some overturning behind
the expanding QLCS will likely reduce the threat closer to the IN
border. Additional scattered storms across western MO behind the MCV
may also pose an isolated risk for damaging gusts and small hail
before weakening after dark.

...lower OH Valley...
Across far southeastern MO southern IL and western KY, additional
storm development will continue this afternoon and evening.
Displaced from the enhanced mid-level flow south of the MCV, a mixed
storm mode of supercells and line segments is expected. Large
buoyancy and the tendency for upscale growth suggests damaging winds
are likely. Low-level shear from the VWX/PAH VAD is maximized along
the low-level confluence axis which could also support a couple
tornadoes with the more discrete cells.

...Southern Plains...
A modified outflow boundary may serve as a focus for scattered storm
development from the TX Panhandle to southern OK this
afternoon/evening. 2000-3000 J/kg of MLCAPE and ~30 kt of deep-layer
flow will support organized clusters or transient supercells with a
risk for hail and damaging gusts. Have expanded the Slight Risk into
southwestern OK where storms appear  most likely to develop. See
MCD#1350 for additional short-term information.

..Lyons.. 06/18/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1119 AM CDT Wed Jun 18 2025/

...Midwest...
A well-defined shortwave trough is currently over western MO,
tracking rapidly eastward.  At the surface, a low is centered over
northeast MO, with a very moist/unstable air mass in place across
much of IL/IN.  As large-scale forcing for ascent and strengthening
wind fields overspread the unstable warm sector, supercell
thunderstorms are expected to rapidly develop.  All severe hazards,
including a few tornadoes, appear possible through the afternoon as
storms track rapidly northeastward across IL into central/northern
IN.  Refer to MCD #1345 for further details.  Congealing outflow may
eventually lead to a greater damaging wind threat as storms spread
into lower MI and northern OH.

To the southeast of this early thunderstorm scenario, another zone
of convective initiation is expected from southeast MO into parts of
KY/southern IN.  These storms are more likely to grow upscale by
early evening, with a risk of damaging winds spreading into southern
OH and central KY.  Have expanded the ENH slightly eastward to
better cover this area.

...Mid Atlantic...
Visible satellite imagery shows mostly clear skies and strong
heating occurring over northern/central VA, where a hot/humid
airmass is present.  Thunderstorms are expected to develop off the
terrain this afternoon and spread eastward into the DelMarVa region.
 Sufficient flow aloft and steep low-level lapse rates will promote
a risk of strong storms capable wind damage.  Isolated strong storms
may also affect south-central VA and northern NC later this
afternoon as well. Refer to MCD #1344 for further details.

Valid 201200Z - 211200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS PARTS OF THE
NORTHERN PLAINS AND UPPER MIDWEST/GREAT LAKES...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms may develop Friday into Friday night across
parts of the northern Plains and upper Midwest.

...Synopsis...
Mid-level ridging will be centered over the northern Plains on
Friday. There is considerable uncertainty regarding evolution of the
ridge with some potential for a mid-level shortwave trough to eject
from a western CONUS trough. The exact evolution of this mid-level
pattern and embedded shortwave troughs will significantly impact
severe weather potential on Friday. 

...Northern Great Plains into the Upper Midwest/Great Lakes...
Guidance is in agreement regarding low to mid 70s dewpoints into the
northern Plains by Friday afternoon/evening. As temperatures warm
well into the 90s, very strong to extreme instability is forecast to
develop across much of the northern Plains and Upper Midwest. Storm
coverage/location is the primary question given the strong ridging
and strong 700mb temperatures across the region. A surface low is
forecast to develop somewhere near the Black Hills with a warm
frontal zone extending eastward from this surface low. This warm
front will likely be the focus for the most intense severe storm
potential on Friday. A stronger mid-level shortwave trough, as
indicated by the 12Z ECMWF, would likely be a scenario with the
greatest severe weather threat. This would involve supercell
development near the surface low/triple point and extending eastward
along the warm front. Eventual upscale growth into a forward
propagating MCS would be likely during the evening with a track
along this frontal zone. This scenario could have the potential for
an intense MCS capable of significant severe wind gusts. 

However, if the mid-level shortwave trough is weaker, storm coverage
may be more isolated as warmer mid-level temperatures prevail. In
this scenario, the environment would still support the potential for
intense storms, but storm coverage would remain questionable.

Regardless of the diurnal threat, the risk will likely persist into
the overnight period across northern Minnesota and northern
Wisconsin as a broad low-level jet strengthens across the Plains and
Upper Midwest. This isentropic ascent, combined with a reservoir of
very strong instability and steep lapse rates will support a severe
weather threat through the overnight period.

Valid 191200Z - 201200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM THE CAROLINA
PIEDMONT INTO PARTS OF THE MID ATLANTIC AND NEW ENGLAND...

...SUMMARY...
Strong to potentially severe thunderstorms are forecast on Thursday
from parts of New England into the Mid Atlantic and Carolinas.

...Synopsis...
A positively tilted mid-level shortwave trough will move from the
Great Lakes to the Northeast on Thursday. Mid-level flow will
strengthen east of this trough from the Mid-Atlantic to the
Northeast. A surface low will deepen as it moves from the eastern
Great Lakes to northern Maine during the period. A cold front will
extend southwest from this surface low and will begin from the
eastern Great Lakes to the Mid-Mississippi Valley Thursday morning
and near or off the Atlantic Coast by 12Z Friday. 

...New England into the Mid-Atlantic/Southeast...
Strong heating is expected across a broad, moist warm sector with
dewpoints in the upper 60s to low 70s east of the Appalachians by
Thursday afternoon. This will result in moderate to potentially
strong instability across much of the East Coast. The best chance
for more organized storms will be from central Virginia northward
where stronger shear will be present beneath 50 knot mid-level flow.
A zone of potentially greater severe weather probabilities may be
present across the Mid-Atlantic where the greatest instability/shear
are expected to overlap. It appears the cold front will lag well
behind with the majority of convection developing along a
pre-frontal trough during the afternoon. Without the stronger
frontal forcing, some concerns about convective coverage/intensity
exist, precluding higher probabilities at this time. 

South of this area, mid-level flow will not be as strong. Therefore,
more modest shear will limit greater storm organization.
Nonetheless, modest (25 knot) shear will support some multicell
storms capable of damaging wind gusts across North Carolina. Even
weaker shear will be present across the southeast where strong
instability is expected. Storms are not expected to be as organized
here, but the strong instability and moist environment could support
some water-loaded downdrafts capable of damaging wind gusts. 

...Southern Montana...
Weak midlevel height falls are still expected across parts of
western MT Thursday afternoon/evening, in response to the
approaching mid/upper-level trough. Low-level moisture will remain
limited, but strong diurnal heating will support high-based storm
development. Steep low-level lapse rates and relatively strong
midlevel flow will result in potential for isolated severe gusts
during the afternoon and evening as convection spreads eastward.

...Upper Midwest...
Low-level warm advection related to the southeastward-moving
midlevel shortwave trough may aid in storm development on Thursday
from northern MN into parts of WI and upper MI. Moderate instability
and sufficient deep-layer shear will support potential for a few
stronger cells/clusters capable of producing large hail and damaging
wind. Additional strong to locally severe storms may redevelop later
Thursday night across parts of this region, in response to a
nocturnally strengthening low-level jet.

...Northern Plains...
Diurnal heating of an increasingly moist airmass will result in
moderate to strong buoyancy across parts of the northern Plains by
Thursday afternoon. Deep-layer shear will be sufficient for
organized storms, but diurnal storm development remains highly
uncertain amid background midlevel height rises associated with a
building ridge. Development of a storm or two cannot be ruled out
through evening near a surface trough/weak dryline. Elevated storm
coverage may increase somewhat Thursday night in response to a
strengthening low-level jet, which could pose a threat of hail and
localized strong gusts.

...Central High Plains...
Moderate to strong buoyancy will develop across the central High
Plains amid strong surface heating. Shear will not be as strong this
far south, but a dryline/surface trough may provide sufficient
forcing for a few high-based storms Thursday afternoon/early
evening.

Valid 181700Z - 191200Z

An upper-level shortwave trough will promote dry downslope westerly
flow into much of the Columbia Basin today. Deeper Pacific moisture
infiltrating through the Columbia River Gorge will mitigate fire
weather concerns along the Oregon/Washington border, but Elevated
highlights were largely maintained for much of the Columbia Basin
with dry fuels in place.

..Williams.. 06/18/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0150 AM CDT Wed Jun 18 2025/

...Synopsis...
Within the base of a deep midlevel low off of British Columbia, a
shortwave trough and related midlevel westerly speed maximum will
overspread the Pacific Northwest. As a result, dry/breezy downslope
flow will develop in the Columbia Basin during the afternoon. Here,
around 15 mph sustained westerly surface winds (higher in the
Cascade Gaps) and 20-25 percent RH will favor elevated to locally
critical fire-weather conditions over dry fuels.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 600 AM CST (1200 UTC), the center of Hurricane Erick was
located near latitude 13.5 North, longitude 95.7 West. Erick is
moving toward the northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h). A northwestward
motion with a gradual increase in forward speed is expected later
today or tonight. On the forecast track, the center of Erick is
expected to approach the coast of southern Mexico late tonight and
move inland or be near the coast on Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 75 mph (120 km/h) with higher
gusts. Rapid strengthening is expected today, and Erick may reach 
major hurricane strength when it approaches the coast of southern 
Mexico Thursday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from 
the center, and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 
miles (110 km) from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 991 mb (29.26 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Erick can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP5 and WMO header
WTPZ45 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Erick will produce rainfall totals of 8 to 16 inches, with
maximum totals of 20 inches, across the Mexican states of Oaxaca and
Guerrero. This rainfall will lead to life-threatening flooding and
mudslides, especially in areas of steep terrain. Rainfall totals of
3 to 5 inches, with maximum totals of 8 inches, are expected across
the Mexican states of Chiapas, Michoacan, Colima and Jalisco.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Hurricane Erick, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep5.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning
area early Thursday and possible in the hurricane watch area on
Thursday. Tropical storm conditions are expected in the tropical
storm warning area later today and tonight.
 
STORM SURGE: A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce coastal
flooding near and to the east of where the center crosses the coast
in areas of onshore winds. The surge will be accompanied by large
and destructive waves.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Erick are expected to begin affecting the
coast of southern Mexico later today.  These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.

Tropical Storm Erick Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052025
300 AM CST Wed Jun 18 2025
 
Satellite imagery indicates continued improvement in Erick’s 
structure, with deep convection wrapping tightly within the 
inner-core region. A recent AMSU microwave pass confirmed a 
better-organized inner core, consistent with the observed 
intensification trend. Although ASCAT data from several hours ago 
sampled about 40-kt peak winds in the northeastern quadrant, Erick 
has strengthened since that time. This is supported by the latest 
subjective Dvorak classifications of T3.5 from TAFB and T4.5 from 
SAB, while the objective ADT estimate from UW-CIMSS has increased to 
near 60 kt and continues to rise. Based on a blend of these data, 
the initial intensity is increased to 55 kt for this advisory.

Erick is moving northwestward at about 310/6 kt. This relatively 
slow forward motion has persisted for the past several hours, 
consistent with a weakening of the mid-level ridge to the north in 
response to a mid- to upper-level trough progressing eastward across 
the central United States. This general motion is expected to 
continue through landfall, which is forecast to occur early Thursday 
along the southern coast of Mexico. The track guidance remains in 
good agreement, and confidence in the overall track is relatively 
high. That said, small track deviations could still lead to 
significant changes in where and when the strongest winds and 
coastal impacts occur due to the oblique angle of approach. The 
official forecast aligns closely with the consensus of the HCCA and 
TVCE aids and remains near the previous NHC track.

The environment ahead of Erick remains highly conducive for 
additional strengthening, with sea surface temperatures near 29 C, 
low vertical wind shear, and abundant mid-level moisture. Several 
dynamic regional models project Erick to reach major hurricane 
strength before landfall, and the Rapid Intensification (RI) 
guidance continues to indicate a significant chance for rapid 
strengthening within the next 36 hours. The NHC forecast remains 
near the upper end of the guidance envelope but could still be 
somewhat conservative, especially if the current trend of improved 
structure continues today.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Erick is expected to rapidly intensify before reaching the coast
of southern Mexico on Thursday, and a hurricane warning is in effect
for portions of the coast of Oaxaca and Guerrero.
 
2. Erick will produce heavy rainfall across portions of Central 
America and Southwest Mexico through this week.  Life-threatening 
flooding and mudslides are likely, especially in areas of steep 
terrain.
 
3. A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce coastal flooding
near and to the east of where the center crosses the coast, in
areas of onshore winds.

Mesoscale Discussion 1334
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0325 PM CDT Tue Jun 17 2025

Areas affected...Southeast Wyoming...southern Nebraska
Panhandle...Front Range into northeast Colorado

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 428...

Valid 172025Z - 172200Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 428
continues.

SUMMARY...Severe wind gust potential increasing just east of the
I-25 corridor and along I-80 in southeast Wyoming and the Nebraska
Panhandle. How far east this activity can maintain intensity is not
clear.

DISCUSSION...Linear convection has increased in intensity east of
Cheyenne and along the I-25 corridor. The most organized wind
signal, per KCYS velocity data, is moving roughly along I-80 east of
Cheyenne. A 69 mph wind gusts was measured with this activity.
Additionally, KFTG is showing a modest increase in wind potential
just east of the I-25 corridor. Areas of the Nebraska Panhandle into
northeast Colorado did receive longer periods of insolation this
afternoon. Farther east, outflow from morning convection has
modified a small degree. While severe wind gusts will become more
probable in the short term, the eastward extent of this threat is
not clear given at least pockets of MLCIN remaining.

Tropical Storm Erick Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052025
300 PM CST Tue Jun 17 2025
 
Erick has continued to become better organized in visible satellite 
imagery, with an extended cloud band curling one revolution around 
the center.  However, there is also some evidence of a dry slot 
filtering into the circulation from the southeast, and possibly as 
a result, infrared cloud top temperatures in the band are not as 
cold as they could be.  Subjective Dvorak classifications have 
risen to T3.0/45 kt from TAFB and T3.5/55 kt from SAB, but the 
initial intensity is held conservatively at 45 kt since objective 
numbers are closest to the TAFB estimate.

The center appears to have turned northwestward (310 degrees) and 
is moving around 6 kt.  A mid-level ridge to the north of the 
cyclone, and a mid-/upper-level trough over northern Mexico, should 
keep Erick on a generally northwestward trajectory for the next 
couple of days, with a gradual increase in forward speed.  The NHC 
forecast track lies close to the HCCA and TVCE consensus aids, and 
it a little east of the previous prediction.  Because of the 
oblique angle of Erick's track relative to the coast, it is 
impossible to know exactly where the strongest winds might occur, 
but it is becoming increasingly likely that they will occur in the 
area of western Oaxaca or eastern Guerrero states.
 
Despite the current convective pattern, the environment of low wind 
shear, high mid-level moisture, and warm sea surface temperatures 
should still support rapid strengthening.  Erick also has the 
structure to enable rapid intensification, and it may only take 
mixing out some of the dry air for that process to begin.  Rapid 
intensification (RI) indices fell a little on this forecast cycle, 
mainly due to a negative contribution from the influx of drier 
boundary layer air.  However, assuming this dry air can mix out, 
the NHC intensity forecast continues to be near the high end of the 
guidance (closest to HCCA and HMON), and still shows Erick near or 
at major hurricane strength when it approaches the coast of 
southern Mexico.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Erick is expected to rapidly intensify before reaching the coast
of southern Mexico on Thursday, and a hurricane warning is in effect 
for portions of the coast of Oaxaca.  A hurricane watch is in effect 
for portions of the Guerrero coast.
 
2. Erick will produce heavy rainfall across portions of Central 
America and Southwest Mexico through this week.  Life-threatening 
flooding and mudslides are possible, especially in areas of steep 
terrain.
 
3. A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce coastal flooding
near and to the east of where the center crosses the coast, in
areas of onshore winds.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 PM CST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Erick was
located near latitude 12.9 North, longitude 94.4 West.  Erick is
moving toward the northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h).  A northwestward 
motion with a gradual increase in forward speed is expected over 
the next couple of days.  On the forecast track, the center of Erick 
is expected to approach the coast of southern Mexico Wednesday 
night and move inland or be near the coast on Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Rapid strengthening is forecast during the next day or two, and 
Erick is expected to become a hurricane by tonight or early 
Wednesday.  Erick is forecast to be near or at major hurricane 
strength when it approaches the coast of southern Mexico Wednesday 
night and Thursday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Erick can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP5 and WMO header
WTPZ45 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Storm Erick could produce rainfall totals of 8 to
16 inches, with maximum totals of 20 inches, across the Mexican
states of Oaxaca and Guerrero. This rainfall may produce life
threatening flooding and mudslides, especially in areas of steep
terrain. Rainfall totals of 3 to 5 inches, with maximum totals of 8
inches, are possible across the Mexican states of Chiapas,
Michoacan, Colima and Jalisco.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Tropical Storm Erick, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic available at

  North-Central and Northeast Oklahoma

* Effective this Tuesday morning from 420 AM until 1000 AM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging winds likely with isolated significant gusts
    to 80 mph possible

SUMMARY...A small but intense bowing cluster of thunderstorms will
move quickly southeastward this morning while posing a threat for
mainly severe/damaging winds. Peak gusts may reach up to 70-80 mph
before the cluster eventually weakens with southward extent into
Oklahoma.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 40
statute miles north and south of a line from 10 miles west northwest
of Enid OK to 25 miles northeast of Tulsa OK. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU6).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 600 AM CST (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Erick was
located near latitude 12.1 North, longitude 93.8 West.  Erick is
moving toward the west-northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h).  A slower
west-northwest to northwest motion is expected during the next few
days.  On the forecast track, the system is expected to approach the
coast of southern Mexico Wednesday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher
gusts. Strengthening is forecast, and the system is expected to
become a hurricane on Wednesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Erick can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP5 and WMO header
WTPZ45 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Storm Erick could produce rainfall totals of 5 to
10 inches, with maximum totals of 15 inches, across the Mexican
states of Chiapas, Oaxaca, and Guerrero and coastal sections of
Guatemala.  This rainfall may produce life-threatening flooding and
mudslides, especially in areas of steep terrain.
 
Rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches, with maximum totals of 6 inches
are possible across interior portions of Southeast Mexico, El
Salvador, interior Guatemala and the Mexican states of Chiapas,
Tabasco and Veracruz.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Tropical Storm Erick, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep5.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are possible in the hurricane watch area
by Wednesday night.  Tropical storm conditions are possible in the
tropical storm watch area by late Wednesday.
 
STORM SURGE: Storm surge could produce coastal flooding near where
the center crosses the coast in areas of onshore winds.  The surge
will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Erick are expected to begin affecting the
coast of southern Mexico in a day or so.  These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.

Tropical Storm Erick Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052025
300 AM CST Tue Jun 17 2025

Satellite imagery shows that the system is gradually becoming 
better organized.  TAFB determined a Dvorak data T-number of T2.5 
which is confirmed from a spiral banding measurement of roughly a 
0.5 wrap on enhanced IR images.  Therefore, the intensity estimate 
is set at 35 kt for this advisory, and the cyclone is being named.

Based on the latest center fixes, the motion remains 300/10 kt, as 
in the previous advisory.  A mid-level ridge to the north of the 
storm is forecast to weaken a bit by the global models, and this 
should result in a west-northwestward to northwestward motion at a 
slower forward speed.  The track guidance is in fairly good 
agreement and similar to the previous model runs.  It should 
be noted that the complexity of the track moving parallel to the 
coast of southern Mexico means that small changes in the system's 
heading will cause substantial differences in where and when the 
most significant wind impacts will occur.  The official track 
forecast is close to the various consensus solutions including the 
FSU Superensemble.  Users are reminded that the average 60-hour NHC 
track error is a little more than 60 n mi.

Erick is situated in an atmospheric and oceanic environment which 
appears to be very conducive for strengthening, with low shear, 
water temperatures near 29 deg C and mid-tropospheric humidities of 
75-80 percent.  The official intensity forecast is a little higher 
than the previous one, but some of the numerical guidance shows 
even more strengthening than that.  Moreover, the various Rapid 
Intensification (RI) indices show a significant chance for RI 
before landfall.  Thus, the NHC forecast for the peak strength of 
Erick could be conservative.

 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Erick is expected to strengthen significantly before 
reaching the coast of southern Mexico, where a Hurricane Watch is 
in effect.
 
2. Erick will likely produce heavy rainfall across portions of 
Central America and southern Mexico through this week. 
Life-threatening flooding and mudslides are possible, especially in
areas of steep terrain.
 
3. A storm surge could produce coastal flooding near where the 
center crosses the coast.

Potential Tropical Cyclone Five-E Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052025
300 PM CST Mon Jun 16 2025
 
Showers and thunderstorms associated with a broad area of low 
pressure located a couple of hundred miles south of the coast of 
Guatemala have increased in organization over the past couple of 
days.  Visible satellite imagery shows an exposed elongated 
low-level center south of a burst of modest convective activity.  
The initial intensity is set to 30 kt based on a partial overpass of 
satellite scatterometer data.  Since the system is expected to 
develop and affect southern Mexico late Wednesday or Thursday, 
advisories have been initiated on Potential Tropical Cyclone Five.

The initial motion is estimated to be 295/7 kt, but this is 
uncertain due to the lack of a defined core.  The low is moving 
along the western periphery of a ridge centered over the 
southwestern Atlantic, and this feature should control the motion of 
the system for the entirety of the forecast period.  Most global and 
regional models predict the low will turn toward the northwest later 
today or tonight, and that motion should persist for the next few 
days.  There is noticeable spread in the along-track speed of the 
system among the various models.  The GFS and some of the regional 
models show a slower motion while the ECMWF and HCCA anticipate a 
quicker forward speed.  The NHC forecast track lies closest to a 
blend of the GFS and the ECMWF, near the center of the guidance 
envelope.

The low should remain over an area of very warm waters and within a 
conducive environment for strengthening.  SHIPS-EC shows a 50 
percent chance of 55 kt of strengthening in 48 hr, which highlights 
the possibility of rapid intensification in the coming days.  The 
official forecast predicts the disturbance will become a tropical 
storm in about a day and a hurricane in a couple of days.  The NHC 
forecast lies near the higher end of the intensity guidance 
envelope.  This system is expected to bring significant winds upon 
landfall in southern Mexico in the next few days or so.  However, it 
is important to note that uncertainty remains high in the exact 
location of potential impacts, and interests in southern Mexico 
should closely monitor the latest forecasts.  

NHC now has the ability to issue tropical cyclone advisory products 
for Potential Tropical Cyclones up to 72 hours before the 
anticipated arrival of tropical-storm-force winds on land when 
confidence is high that there is a significant risk of wind or storm 
surge impacts to land, regardless of the immediate need for 
land-based hurricane or tropical storm watches or warnings,   
Previously, Potential Tropical Cyclone advisories could be issued up 
to 48 hours beforehand.   Appropriate watches and warnings will 
still be issued 48 and 36 hours, respectively, before the onset of 
tropical-storm-force winds.

KEY MESSAGES:

1. The disturbance is expected to become a tropical storm on Tuesday 
and quickly strengthen into a hurricane by Wednesday as it 
approaches southern Mexico.  Hurricane watches will likely be 
required for portions of southern Mexico tonight or early Tuesday.. 

2. The system will likely produce heavy rainfall across portions of 
Central America and southern Mexico through this week.  
Life-threatening flooding and mudslides are possible, especially in 
areas of steep terrain.

Mesoscale Discussion 1314
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0349 PM CDT Mon Jun 16 2025

Areas affected...east-central to northern MN

Concerning...Tornado Watch 423...

Valid 162049Z - 162215Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 423 continues.

SUMMARY...The severe threat should increase into early evening as
additional storms develop southward in central Minnesota and spread
east.

DISCUSSION...Initially low-topped convection has gradually deepened
over the past hour. Cells near the surface cyclone in west-central
MN have mainly had a brief tornado threat thus far. But an arcing
line of towering CU towards Willmar ahead of the surface cold front
suggests additional storms should form into the instability axis
characterized by moderate buoyancy with MLCAPE of 1500-2500 J/kg.
This activity should intensify into early evening and support a more
sustained severe threat beyond brief tornadoes. The overall severe
threat may peak into early evening with any sustained supercells
that can interact with residual outflow from storms that have spread
into west-central WI. MPX VWP data has sampled enhanced low-level
SRH near this outflow.

Mesoscale Discussion 1313
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0253 PM CDT Mon Jun 16 2025

Areas affected...Parts of southern Montana into far northern Wyoming

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 161953Z - 162200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Widely scattered storms are possible southern
Montana/northern Wyoming. Supercells capable of large hail and
severe winds are expected. Though timing is uncertain, a watch is
possible this afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Modestly moist upslope flow and an approaching
mid-level trough have promoted thunderstorm development within the
terrain of south-central Montana. This has occurred north of a band
of cirrus over much of Wyoming. While these storms have been slow to
intensify, continued surface heating this afternoon will increase
MLCAPE values to over 1000 J/kg. Effective shear of 45-55 kts will
help to organize convection into supercells capable of large hail
and severe wind gusts. Even with the approaching trough, mid-level
height falls will generally remain neutral until later in the
evening. It is not clear what storm coverage will be, but at least
widely scattered storms are possible with additional development
occurring in northern Wyoming near the Big Horns. Another point of
uncertainty is how far south/east activity will go given greater
inhibition underneath the cirrus canopy.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 423
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
255 PM CDT Mon Jun 16 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Central Minnesota
  Western Wisconsin

* Effective this Monday afternoon and evening from 255 PM until
  900 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A couple tornadoes possible
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2.5
    inches in diameter likely
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph likely

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms will intensify this afternoon near a cold
front sweeping eastward across the Minnesota, with a few supercells
expected.  Large hail is the main concern, but the strongest storms
may also pose a risk of damaging winds and a few tornadoes.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 70 statute miles
north and south of a line from 20 miles west of Alexandria MN to 80
miles northeast of Minneapolis MN. For a complete depiction of the
watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU3).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 2.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 60 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean
storm motion vector 27030.

Mesoscale Discussion 1304
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0349 PM CDT Sun Jun 15 2025

Areas affected...eastern Wyoming into eastern Colorado

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 152049Z - 152245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms expected to increase in coverage with
potential for large hail and damaging wind.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorm activity continues to increase, mainly
along and near the higher terrain/upslope regions, across the Front
Range into portions of eastern Wyoming. The downstream air mass
remains under the influence of strong MLCIN, albeit gradually
weakening along the western fringe. This weakening trend is set to
continue as forcing for ascent increases with a shortwave passage
this afternoon/evening. 

Thunderstorms are likely to form and quickly cluster this evening.
Once uncapped, the downstream air mass is moderately to very
unstable (with MLCAPE around 2000-3500 J/kg). Initially, supercells
capable of large hail and damaging wind will be the main threat
before a transition to linear bowing segments and focus for
potential damaging wind into portions of Nebraska. In the short
term, In addition, deepening cumulus is observed further east across
Cherry County in Nebraska. A supercell or two could emerge within
this region ahead of the main forcing. A watch will likely be needed
to cover these potential threats in the coming hours.

Mesoscale Discussion 1303
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0344 PM CDT Sun Jun 15 2025

Areas affected...Southeast Colorado into eastern New Mexico and far
West Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 152044Z - 152245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Large hail and severe wind gusts are possible with storms
that move off the terrain into southeast Colorado and eastern New
Mexico. A watch is not expected in the short term, but trends will
be monitored into the evening where a more organized wind threat
could evolve farther east.

DISCUSSION...Convection has developed from the Sangre de Cristo into
the southern Rockies this afternoon as moderately moist (mid 50s F
dewpoints) upslope flow has persisted over the last few hours. To
the east, a modifying outflow boundary from an earlier MCS in the
southern Plains has entered eastern New Mexico and should eventually
reach the terrain. While this outflow is slightly cooler, low 60s F
dewpoints have promoted 2000-2500 J/kg MLCAPE with weaker
inhibition. The expectation is for storms to eventually move off the
terrain as MLCIN is eroded in the next hour or two. Modestly
enhanced northwesterlies aloft on the western flank of the MCV atop
southeasterly surface winds supports 35-45 kts of effective shear
(stronger in the north and weaker south). Steep mid-level lapse
rates and strong shear should allow initial supercells to produce
large hail (up to 2.5 inches) as well as severe winds.

Some model guidance has suggested clustering is possible in
northeast New Mexico where stronger shear and greater buoyancy will
overlap. With only a weak low-level jet response in the Texas
Panhandle/South Plains this evening, it is not clear how far east
such a cluster/small MCS could propagate. A greater wind threat
would exist if this occurs. Overall, storm coverage should remain
isolated at least into early evening and a watch is not currently
expected. Trends in convective evolution will need to be monitored
into this evening, however.

Mesoscale Discussion 1302
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0213 PM CDT Sun Jun 15 2025

Areas affected...eastern Montana

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 151913Z - 152115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm development likely to increase over the next
couple of hours with initial supercells capable large to very large
hail and damaging wind.

DISCUSSION...Convective development has begun across the high
terrain in central Montana. This should increased in coverage as a
shortwave rotates out of Idaho into Montana this afternoon/evening
and forcing for ascent increases.

Initially, the moderately unstable and strongly sheared air mass
should support supercells. Given the steep lapse rates and linear
elongated hodographs, these will be capable of large to very large
hail (2-3+ in). Where east to southeasterly flow resides in
east-central/eastern Montana leading to sufficient low level SRH, a
tornado would be possible. 

Evolution through the afternoon should favor clustering and attempts
at upscale growth, to which the primary hazard will likely become
strong to significant damaging wind (some 60-75+ mph). A Severe
Thunderstorm Watch will be needed to cover this threat within the
next couple of hours.

Tropical Storm Dalila Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042025
200 PM MST Sun Jun 15 2025
 
Dalila's convection has collapsed, leaving behind a single
fragmented band of thunderstorms.  Subjective and objective
satellite estimates have lowered this cycle and the initial
intensity has been reduced to 40 kt based on a blend of the TAFB and
SAB Dvorak estimates. Dalila is expected to continue weakening as
the storm moves over cooler waters and into a hostile environment.
The NHC intensity forecast predicts Dalila to become a post-tropical
remnant low later today.
 
The storm is moving west-northwestward at 8 kt and should continue
gradually turning westward in the low-level flow. A more westward
motion is expected in the next day or two until the system
dissipates in a couple of days.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 418
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
215 PM MDT Sun Jun 15 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Central and eastern Montana
  North central Wyoming

* Effective this Sunday afternoon and evening from 215 PM until
  1100 PM MDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 80
    mph likely
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 3
    inches in diameter likely
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms are expected to increase in coverage and
intensity through the afternoon while spreading eastward from the
higher terrain.  The storm environment initially favors supercells
with very large hail (2-3 inch diameter), while upscale growth into
clusters is expected this evening with an increasing threat for
60-80 mph outflow winds.  Favorable storm interactions could also
support an isolated tornado or two this evening.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 100
statute miles north and south of a line from 30 miles west of
Harlowton MT to 10 miles east northeast of Baker MT. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU8).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
3 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 70 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 550. Mean storm motion vector
27020.

Tropical Storm Dalila Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042025
200 AM MST Sun Jun 15 2025
 
Dalila is likely near its peak intensity, with little change in
organization evident since the previous advisory package. The latest
subjective Dvorak intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB were 65
knots and 55 knots, respectively. Objective estimates ranged from
45 to 57 knots, while an ASCAT pass earlier in the day showed
numerous 50 knot wind barbs. Based on a blend of these data, the
initial intensity for this advisory has been held at 55 knots.
 
Dalila is now heading toward the west-northwest, or 285/12 knots. A
turn toward the west is expected during the next day or so, as 
Dalila is steered by a mid-level ridge over northern Mexico and the 
southwest U.S. A westward to slightly south of due west motion is 
then forecast through dissipation as Dalila moves over much
cooler waters. The current forecast shows Dalila becoming a
post-tropical remnant low in a day or so, and dissipating by 
Tuesday. The latest track forecast is very close to that of the 
previous advisory, and is close to the track consensus aids.

Dalila should begin to weaken later today as some drier mid-level
air evident in water vapor imagery begins to impact the system.  
More steady weakening is then likely as the system moves
over much cooler water and into a progressively drier mid-level
environment. The latest intensity forecast is close to the previous
advisory and in good agreement with the intensity consensus
guidance.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. The outer bands of Tropical Storm Dalila will bring locally heavy 
rainfall to the Mexican states of Michoacán and Guerrero through 
this morning. Scattered areas of flooding and mudslides are 
expected, especially in areas of steep terrain near the coast.
 
2. Dalila is expected to produce tropical-storm-force winds across
portions of the warning area during the next few hours.  Winds 
will diminish today while the system moves farther offshore of the 
coast of southwestern Mexico.
