Mesoscale Discussion 1038
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0306 PM CDT Thu May 29 2025

Areas affected...southeast New Mexico into West Texas and parts of
the Texas Big Country

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 292006Z - 292130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...The severe weather threat will increase across southeast
New Mexico and West Texas later this afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Moderate instability has developed across West Texas
and into far southeastern New Mexico this afternoon. Additional
heating and destabilization, combined with increasing ascent ahead
of a southeastward moving shortwave trough, should be sufficient for
storm development later this afternoon along and south of the front
moving south across West Texas. Storms will initially be
supercellular given 45-50 knots of effective shear (per SPC
mesoanalysis). The primary hazard initially will be large hail, with
the potential for hail in excess of 3 inches. Some tornado and
severe wind threat will also exist during the supercell storm mode.
Through time, these supercells may congeal into a southeastward
moving MCS. In addition, the mass of convection across southeast New
Mexico and vicinity may eventually develop a strong enough cold pool
to support a forward propagating MCS as it moves southeast into the
greater instability. As these MCSs combine, the severe wind threat
will increase, particularly as storms move into the Texas Big
Country/Concho Valley later this evening.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 346
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
350 PM CDT Thu May 29 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Southeast New Mexico
  Far West into West and West-Central Texas

* Effective this Thursday afternoon and evening from 350 PM until
  1100 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 85
    mph likely
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 3.5
    inches in diameter likely
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Scattered severe thunderstorms are forecast to develop
over the northwestern half of the Watch this afternoon.  The
stronger thunderstorms will likely become supercells and be capable
of large to giant hail (1 to 3.5 inches in diameter).  A tornado is
possible early this evening before additional storms congeal into an
eastward-moving thunderstorm cluster.  Severe gusts ranging from
60-85 mph are possible with the more intense downdrafts within the
cluster.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 90
statute miles north and south of a line from 15 miles west northwest
of Carlsbad NM to 65 miles north northeast of San Angelo TX. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU6).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
3.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 75 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
28020.

Tropical Storm Alvin Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP012025
200 PM MST Thu May 29 2025
 
Satellite imagery depicts that Alvin has continued to become better 
organized throughout the day, showing convective banding and a 
central dense overcast with cold cloud tops near -75C located over 
the low-level center. An earlier scatterometer pass shows wind 
speeds around 45 kt. Given the improving convective structure since 
that pass, and increasing objective satellite intensity estimates, 
the initial intensity has increased to 50 kt for this advisory.
 
The initial motion is 320/10 kt.  The storm is expected to continue
moving toward the northwest today, then begin turning toward the
north-northwest tomorrow as it moves around a ridge centered over
central Mexico. By tomorrow night, Alvin will begin moving northward
as it is influenced by a mid-level cut-off low. The NHC track
forecast is very near the previous one.
 
The storm will remain within a favorable environment of warm sea 
surface temperatures and low wind shear over the next 12 hours or 
so. Given the latest convective trends and conducive conditions, the 
peak intensity forecast has increased this cycle to 60 kt. Tomorrow, 
Alvin will begin to move into a hostile environment with cooler 
SSTs, higher wind shear, and a drier mid-level airmass which will 
induce weakening. Latest model derived IR imagery from both the 
ECMWF and GFS depict the system becoming devoid of convection, and 
the latest NHC forecast depicts the system becoming a remnant low in 
48 h. Thus, there is high confidence that the system will weaken to 
a remnant low before it nears the Baja California Peninsula.

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM MST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Alvin was 
located near latitude 15.1 North, longitude 107.2 West. Alvin is 
moving toward the northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h). This general 
motion is expected to continue through today, followed by a 
northward turn tomorrow and Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 60 mph (95 km/h) with 
higher gusts. Some additional strengthening is expected through 
early tomorrow, but weakening is expected to begin by late Friday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF: Swells generated by Alvin will affect portions of the coast of
west-central Mexico and the coast of the southern Baja California
Peninsula during the next couple of days. These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 800 PM MST.

Day 1 Convective Outlook

0305 PM CDT Thu May 29 2025

Valid 292000Z - 301200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM THE TEXAS
SOUTH PLAINS TO THE HILL COUNTRY...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
SOUTHERN PLAINS AND THE SOUTHEAST...

...SUMMARY...
Large to very large hail, significant severe gusts, and a couple of
tornadoes remain possible with severe with thunderstorms this
afternoon and evening from the Texas-New Mexico border eastward into
central Texas. Thunderstorms producing scattered damaging winds are
possible this afternoon across parts of the Southeast.

...20z Update Southern Plains...
Convective development underway across the southern High Plains of
eastern NM and west TX is expected to continue maturing through this
afternoon. Supercells, with an initial risk for large to very large
hail, damaging gusts and a couple tornadoes remain likely. Upscale
growth into one or more MCS/strong clusters is expected this evening
as large-scale ascent overspreads the Southern Plains. Recent hi-res
guidance and more widespread convective development over the High
Plains suggest somewhat greater coverage/persistence of severe
storms is possible across central TX and the Big Bend region this
evening. Have opted to expand the Slight Risk across
central/south-central TX, where damaging gusts and hail potential,
associated with the expanding cluster/clusters of severe storms, may
extend eastward this evening into the early overnight hours.

Farther north, severe probabilities have been trimmed along the Red
River vicinity of southwest OK and western North TX where persistent
cloud cover along a slow-moving cold front have limited
destabilization. Ahead of the front, weak low-level warm advection
may support additional storms this evening. A conditional risk of
large hail and damaging winds remains in place with any sustained
convective clusters able to develop.

...Gulf Coast and Southeast...
Persistent cloud cover and convective overturning from an ongoing
broad cluster of embedded thunderstorms will continue to spread
eastward along the Gulf Coast and Southeast states this afternoon.
Sporadic damaging gusts will remain possible with the stronger
embedded cores. However, the lack of stronger surface heating and
convective overturning has largely negated the western edge of the
severe risk from west-central GA, into AL and the western FL
Panhandle. To the east, some clearing and diurnal heating has
allowed a more focused corridor of destabilization to develop along
the immediate coast from the Savannah River in east GA to
southeastern NC. This larger buoyancy, overlapping with
strengthening westerly mid-level flow, should support one or more
loosely organized clusters capable of producing scattered damaging
winds and perhaps isolated hail across the coastal plain and
immediate coast into this evening. Have adjusted the Slight Risk
area to better capture the potential for damaging gusts with
ongoing/expected storms.

Otherwise, see the prior discussion for additional information.

..Lyons.. 05/29/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1130 AM CDT Thu May 29 2025/

...Southern Plains...
Visible satellite imagery indicates strong heating will occur south
of a cold front currently draped from east-central NM into the
southern portion of the TX Panhandle/South Plains.  Relatively moist
low-level easterly flow with 60s deg F surface dewpoints and steep
mid-level lapse rates, will support MLCAPE up to 2500-3000 J/kg by
mid/late afternoon and 35-45 kt of deep-layer shear.  Even though
large-scale forcing associated with an upper trough over the Midwest
and central Plains will remain modest with southward extent into the
southern High Plains, scattered thunderstorm development is forecast
by mid-late afternoon near the front and across southeast NM, with
increasing coverage and clustering possible this evening.  Models
shows initially supercells capable of large to very large hail and
perhaps some tornado risk early in the convective life cycle across
parts of eastern NM into portions of the TX South Plains.  The
aforementioned upscale growth/clustering is expected and depicted in
several recent CAMs, suggestive of a corridor of severe gusts
(perhaps locally in the 70-85 mph range) mainly this evening.  

Farther east, most guidance depicts more isolated coverage of
thunderstorms near the front from southern OK into north TX.
However, moderate to strong instability and sufficient deep-layer
shear will support a conditional risk of large hail and damaging
wind with any sustained convection in this region.  Isolated strong
to severe thunderstorms will also be possible from the Raton Mesa
vicinity southward across eastern NM, within a weakly unstable but
favorably sheared environment. The strongest cores may pose a threat
of isolated hail and severe gusts during the afternoon and early
evening.

...Southeast...
Isolated strong to severe thunderstorms this morning along the Gulf
Coast will continue east across adjacent portions of southern AL/FL
Panhandle into southern GA.  This activity is immediately ahead of
an eastward-migrating shortwave trough over the northern Gulf Coast.
Extensive cloud debris and some convective overturning this morning
will act to limit the overall severe threat across the FL
Panhandle/southern AL.  Farther east and northeast, stronger
destabilization has occurred through midday with temperatures rising
into the 80s/lower 90s deg F and dewpoints in the low-mid 70s. 
MLCAPE increasing to around 1500-2000 J/kg is forecast over the
coastal plain where stronger heating has occurred already this
morning. Strong to severe convection may either persist from the
ongoing morning activity, or initiate within the weakly capped
environment across parts of GA into SC. Low-level flow will likely
remain rather weak, but some strengthening of westerly mid-level
winds should support one or more loosely organized clusters capable
of producing scattered damaging winds and perhaps isolated hail. 

...Ozarks into the Mid-South...
Some low-level moistening is expected through the day from parts of
northern AR/southern MO into the Mid-South, in association with a
approaching mid/upper-level trough and developing weak surface
cyclone.  Relatively modest heating and weak lapse rates aloft may
tend to limit buoyancy, but ascent attendant to the approaching
shortwave trough may support scattered thunderstorm development
along/ahead of a front from late afternoon into the evening.  Have
expanded low-severe probabilities farther east into south-central KY
and Middle TN where recent guidance shows sufficient destabilization
may occur late tonight.  The strengthening wind profiles during this
timeframe ahead of the mid-level disturbance may support a
conditional risk for a few supercells capable of all-severe hazards.

Day 3 Convective Outlook

0251 PM CDT Thu May 29 2025

Valid 311200Z - 011200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
MID-ATLANTIC AND TEXAS RIO GRANDE VICINITY...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe storms with marginally severe wind gusts and hail
will be possible on Saturday from parts of North Carolina northward
into the Mid-Atlantic, and across parts of the Rio Grande Valley of
Texas.

...Mid-Atlantic States...
The primary cold front and preceding moist air mass will likely have
pushed into the western Atlantic by Saturday morning. However, weak
post-frontal buoyancy should develop during the day as lapse rates
diurnally steepen coincident with a modestly moist air mass. This
could lead to some strong low-topped storms by afternoon,
particularly along/south of a secondary wind shift/weak front. It
appears that some potential for marginally severe hail and wind will
exist, mainly Saturday afternoon until around sunset.

...Texas Rio Grande Valley...
Northwest mid-level flow will be in place on Saturday across the Rio
Grande Valley. At the surface, an axis of low-level moisture is
forecast from south Texas northwestward along and near the Rio
Grande River. Although large-scale ascent will be weak, isolated
thunderstorms could develop as surface temperatures and
surface-based buoyancy peak in the afternoon. Steep low-level lapse
rates and sufficient deep-layer shear could be enough for marginally
severe wind gusts and hail.

...South-central Plains/Ozarks...
While confidence in forecast specifics are not high at the Day 3
time frame, severe probabilities may be needed in future outlooks.
Some potential will exist for thunderstorm development on the
periphery of the upper ridge, potentially including MCS development
Saturday afternoon into Saturday night. This currently appears most
probable across parts of Kansas and Oklahoma, and moderate buoyancy
and modest vertical shear could be conducive to some severe storms
in this scenario.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0219 PM CDT Thu May 29 2025

Valid 301200Z - 311200Z

Southeasterly winds associated with a backdoor cold front/Southern
Plains surface high will bring an influx of moisture back into
southern New Mexico and southwestern Arizona Friday. Daytime
instability initially over higher terrain along with increased
moisture availability (precipitable water values of 0.50-0.70") will
support isolated dry thunderstorms from the Pinaleno Mountains in
southeastern Arizona towards the San Mateo Mountains southwest of
Albuquerque where dry fuels make ignition more likely. Probability
of wetting rains >0.10" from showers and thunderstorms increases
towards far Western Texas where a deeper moisture profile should
exist Friday.

..Williams.. 05/29/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1232 AM CDT Thu May 29 2025/

...Synopsis...
Steady moisture increase will continue westward, as far as
southeastern Arizona, Friday as a backdoor cold front and
southeasterly flow continue across New Mexico D1/Thurs into D2/Fri.
This will bring potential for dry thunderstorm chances into far
western New Mexico/southeastern Arizona by Friday afternoon.
Precipitable water values look to increase through the day, however,
at least some mix of dry/wet thunderstorms is expected with
generally less that <0.10" of precipitation for most places. Fuels
in these regions remain in the 75ht-90th percentile for dryness and
would support new ignitions. As such, an area of isolated dry
thunderstorm chances was maintained and expanded with this outlook
to include areas of Arizona just east of the Pinaleno Mountains and
Chiricahua Mountains into western New Mexico.

Valid 301200Z - 311200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
CAROLINAS/MID-ATLANTIC/SOUTHEAST STATES...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe storms with wind damage, large hail, and a couple
tornadoes will be possible especially Friday afternoon and evening
across the Mid-Atlantic/Southeast States.

...Carolinas/Mid-Atlantic/Southeast States... 
As large-scale pattern amplification occurs over the CONUS, a
shortwave trough located over the lower Ohio River Valley early
Friday morning, will steadily progress east-southeastward over the
southern Appalachians and reach the Carolinas/Virginia by Friday
evening. Strong winds aloft will accompany this shortwave trough
with a belt of 60+ kt mid-level winds overspreading the southern
Appalachians and Carolinas. 

While the warm sector preceding an east/southeastward-moving cold
front will not be strongly unstable, particularly by late-spring
standards, prevalent 60s F surface dewpoints, steepening mid-level
lapse rates and strong deep-layer shear will support organized
severe storms especially into Friday afternoon through early
evening, including relatively fast-moving storms for late spring.
While a few early day severe storms could occur across eastern
Kentucky and nearby Allegheny Plateau/Appalachians, the main severe
risk should begin to evolve in the immediate lee of the Appalachians
including the Blue Ridge vicinity by Friday early/mid-afternoon.
These storms, including some supercells and more prevalent evolving
linear clusters with bowing segments, should reach coastal areas by
early evening. Damaging winds and severe hail can be expected, and
some tornado potential may exist as well, particularly across
Virginia/North Carolina near the surface wave and warm front where
low-level shear/SRH should maximize.

...Eastern Wisconsin/northern Illinois/Lake Michigan vicinity...
A south/southeastward-digging clipper-type shortwave trough will
influence the region into Friday afternoon and evening, with
thunderstorms potentially focusing near a weak surface
wave/instability gradient as a cold front otherwise progresses
southward across the region. Low-level moisture will be rather
modest with afternoon dewpoints generally limited to the lower 50s
F. However, relatively steep lapse rates and moderately strong
vertical shear, enhanced by 50+ northwesterly mid-level winds,
should support strong/isolated severe storms Friday afternoon into
evening, with hail and wind possible as storms progress
south-southeastward.

...Eastern New Mexico...
While the overall scenario will not be as severe storm-favorable as
prior days, a couple of locally severe storms may occur Friday
afternoon/early evening mainly near the higher terrain of
east-central New Mexico.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1145 AM CDT Thu May 29 2025

Valid 291700Z - 301200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

Overlap of dry and windy conditions will be limited across CONUS as
an upper-level ridge builds across the western U.S today. Isolated
afternoon thunderstorms are expected along the Continental Divide
and adjacent higher terrain. Diurnally driven thunderstorms will
remain largely east of the Rio Grande Valley, east of where the
driest and most receptive fuels to fire spread exist across the
Southwest.

..Williams.. 05/29/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1230 AM CDT Thu May 29 2025/

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns are expected to remain limited today. Moisture
will continue to increase in New Mexico on the backside of the
surface high across the southern Plains, with increasing
thunderstorm coverage expected by the afternoon. A few initially dry
high based thunderstorms may occur on the fringes of the better
moisture in western New Mexico. However, the spatial extent of this
area look to limited to include with this outlook. 

As a trough enters the Pacific Northwest, dry and windy conditions
will overspread the Columbia River Basin into the Snake River Plain.
Overall, guidance from partners indicates that fuels in these
regions have not yet dried sufficiently to support fire spread.

1130 AM CDT Thu May 29 2025

Valid 291630Z - 301200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR PARTS OF
THE TEXAS SOUTH PLAINS INTO THE TEXAS BIG COUNTRY...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS PARTS OF THE
COASTAL PLAIN OF GEORGIA AND SOUTH CAROLINA...

...SUMMARY...
Large to very large hail, significant severe gusts, and a couple of
tornadoes will be a concern with thunderstorms this afternoon and
evening from the Texas-New Mexico border eastward into central
Texas. Thunderstorms producing scattered damaging winds are possible
this afternoon across parts of the Southeast.

...Southern Plains...
Visible satellite imagery indicates strong heating will occur south
of a cold front currently draped from east-central NM into the
southern portion of the TX Panhandle/South Plains.  Relatively moist
low-level easterly flow with 60s deg F surface dewpoints and steep
mid-level lapse rates, will support MLCAPE up to 2500-3000 J/kg by
mid/late afternoon and 35-45 kt of deep-layer shear.  Even though
large-scale forcing associated with an upper trough over the Midwest
and central Plains will remain modest with southward extent into the
southern High Plains, scattered thunderstorm development is forecast
by mid-late afternoon near the front and across southeast NM, with
increasing coverage and clustering possible this evening.  Models
shows initially supercells capable of large to very large hail and
perhaps some tornado risk early in the convective life cycle across
parts of eastern NM into portions of the TX South Plains.  The
aforementioned upscale growth/clustering is expected and depicted in
several recent CAMs, suggestive of a corridor of severe gusts
(perhaps locally in the 70-85 mph range) mainly this evening.  

Farther east, most guidance depicts more isolated coverage of
thunderstorms near the front from southern OK into north TX.
However, moderate to strong instability and sufficient deep-layer
shear will support a conditional risk of large hail and damaging
wind with any sustained convection in this region.  Isolated strong
to severe thunderstorms will also be possible from the Raton Mesa
vicinity southward across eastern NM, within a weakly unstable but
favorably sheared environment. The strongest cores may pose a threat
of isolated hail and severe gusts during the afternoon and early
evening.

...Southeast...
Isolated strong to severe thunderstorms this morning along the Gulf
Coast will continue east across adjacent portions of southern AL/FL
Panhandle into southern GA.  This activity is immediately ahead of
an eastward-migrating shortwave trough over the northern Gulf Coast.
Extensive cloud debris and some convective overturning this morning
will act to limit the overall severe threat across the FL
Panhandle/southern AL.  Farther east and northeast, stronger
destabilization has occurred through midday with temperatures rising
into the 80s/lower 90s deg F and dewpoints in the low-mid 70s. 
MLCAPE increasing to around 1500-2000 J/kg is forecast over the
coastal plain where stronger heating has occurred already this
morning. Strong to severe convection may either persist from the
ongoing morning activity, or initiate within the weakly capped
environment across parts of GA into SC. Low-level flow will likely
remain rather weak, but some strengthening of westerly mid-level
winds should support one or more loosely organized clusters capable
of producing scattered damaging winds and perhaps isolated hail. 

...Ozarks into the Mid-South...
Some low-level moistening is expected through the day from parts of
northern AR/southern MO into the Mid-South, in association with a
approaching mid/upper-level trough and developing weak surface
cyclone.  Relatively modest heating and weak lapse rates aloft may
tend to limit buoyancy, but ascent attendant to the approaching
shortwave trough may support scattered thunderstorm development
along/ahead of a front from late afternoon into the evening.  Have
expanded low-severe probabilities farther east into south-central KY
and Middle TN where recent guidance shows sufficient destabilization
may occur late tonight.  The strengthening wind profiles during this
timeframe ahead of the mid-level disturbance may support a
conditional risk for a few supercells capable of all-severe hazards.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE SOUTHERN PLAINS AND SOUTHEAST...

...SUMMARY...
Large to very large hail, severe winds, and a couple of tornadoes
will be a concern with thunderstorms this afternoon and evening from
the Texas-New Mexico border eastward into central Texas.
Thunderstorms producing scattered damaging winds are possible later
today across parts of the Southeast. An isolated severe threat may
develop this afternoon across the Ozarks and Mid-South vicinity.

...Southern Plains...
Strong daytime heating is expected today near/south of a cold front
from parts of eastern NM into west-central TX. Generally 60s surface
dewpoints and steep mid-level lapse rates will support MLCAPE up to
2500-3000 J/kg by mid/late afternoon, with 35-45 kt of deep-layer
shear sufficient for organized convection, including supercells.
Even though large-scale forcing associated with an upper trough over
the Midwest and central Plains will remain modest with southward
extent into the southern High Plains, robust thunderstorm
development should initially occur by 19-22Z near the front across
eastern NM into west-central TX, with increasing coverage and
clustering possible this evening. Large to isolated very large hail
(2-3+ inches in diameter) and severe gusts should be the main
threats. There may also be some potential for a couple of tornadoes,
especially in the vicinity of the surface boundary where low-level
winds will be backed to east-southeasterly late this afternoon and
early evening, modestly enhancing 0-1 km SRH.

Farther east, most guidance depicts more isolated coverage of
thunderstorms near the front from southern OK into north TX.
However, moderate to strong instability and sufficient deep-layer
shear will support a conditional risk of large hail and damaging
wind with any sustained convection in this region. Isolated strong
to severe thunderstorms will also be possible from the Raton Mesa
vicinity southward across eastern NM, within a weakly unstable but
favorably sheared environment. The strongest cores may pose a threat
of isolated hail and severe gusts during the afternoon and early
evening, before quickly weakening with eastward extent and the loss
of daytime heating.

...Lower Mississippi Valley/Southeast...
Thunderstorms are ongoing this morning along/near the coast across
southern LA/MS/AL and the FL Panhandle. This activity is related to
large-scale ascent and modest low-level warm/moist advection
occurring ahead of a mid/upper-level trough moving eastward across
the lower MS Valley. Some enhancement to deep-layer flow/shear
associated with the trough could support occasional strong to
locally severe thunderstorms this morning, but instability over land
is generally expected to remain weak owing to poor lapse rates aloft
and persistent cloudiness. 

Downstream of this morning convection and the mid/upper-level
trough, diurnal heating of a moist airmass should foster the
development of weak to moderate instability by this afternoon, with
MLCAPE increasing to around 1500-2000 J/kg where stronger heating
occurs. Strong to severe convection may either persist from the
ongoing morning activity, or initiate within the weakly capped
environment across parts of GA into SC. Low-level flow will likely
remain rather weak, but some strengthening of westerly mid-level
winds should support one or more loosely organized clusters capable
of producing scattered damaging winds and perhaps isolated hail. The
Slight Risk has been maintained for parts of GA/SC with this update,
where confidence remains in stronger pre-convective
heating/destabilization and steepening of low-level lapse rates.

...Ozarks into the Mid-South...
Some low-level moistening is expected through the day from parts of
northern AR/southern MO into the Mid-South, in association with a
approaching mid/upper-level trough and developing weak surface
cyclone. Relatively modest heating and weak lapse rates aloft may
tend to limit buoyancy, but ascent attendant to the approaching
shortwave trough may support scattered thunderstorm development
along/ahead of a front from late afternoon into the evening.
Increasingly favorable wind profiles and related deep-layer shear
could support a few stronger cells despite the modest instability,
with some potential for isolated damaging winds, hail, and perhaps a
tornado. Greater severe probabilities may need to be considered for
parts of this region, if observational trends support greater
destabilization than currently forecast.

Tropical Depression One-E Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP012025
200 AM MST Thu May 29 2025
 
The depression has been holding steady overnight.  While 
thunderstorm activity has increased since the previous advisory, 
recent scatterometer data has revealed that the surface winds remain 
generally unchanged.  The initial intensity is held at 30 kt based 
on the ASCAT data, which is also close to the other subjective and 
objective satellite estimates.

The initial motion is 330/8 kt.  The depression is expected to move 
north-northwestward to northwestward for the next day or so.  Then 
an amplifying upper-level trough offshore Baja California should 
turn the system northward on Friday and into the weekend. The NHC 
track forecast has shifted slightly to the west, largely because of 
the initial position, and it lies between the various consensus 
aids.
 
The window for the cyclone to strengthen is gradually closing.  The 
depression is still expected to become a tropical storm sometime 
later today, though the system only has about 36 hours of conducive 
environmental conditions.  The NHC peak intensity has been lowered 
to 50 kt and is at the top of the intensity forecast guidance 
envelope.  In a couple of days, the vertical wind shear is forecast 
to increase while the cyclone moves over cooler waters and into a 
dry and stable air mass. Global models predict the system will lose 
its organized convection at this point and the NHC forecast now 
shows the system becoming post-tropical in 60 h.  Based on the 
latest track and size forecasts, tropical-storm-force winds are not 
expected to impact the coast of mainland Mexico or Baja California.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0311 AM CDT Thu May 29 2025

Valid 011200Z - 061200Z

...DISCUSSION...
...Sunday/Day 4 and Monday/Day 5...
On Sunday and Monday, a mid-level ridge is forecast to move eastward
across the north-central U.S. A low-level jet is forecast to develop
in the High Plains on Sunday with this feature strengthening on
Monday, as a trough moves through the Rockies. In response,
low-level moisture will increase across the Great Plains, allowing
for moderate destabilization across much of the region during the
day. Scattered thunderstorm development is expected Monday from
parts of the southern and central High Plains, northeastward along a
cold front into the Dakotas. Although deep-layer shear is not
forecast to be particular strong, the models do suggest that strong
instability will be possible across parts of the Dakotas by late
Monday afternoon. This likely would support a large hail and
wind-damage threat.

...Tuesday/Day 6 to Thursday/Day 8...
On Tuesday, the shortwave mid-level trough is forecast to move
eastward into the southern and central High Plains. Scattered
thunderstorms are expected Tuesday afternoon from the mid Missouri
Valley southward into eastern Kansas and east-central Oklahoma. In
addition to moderate/strong instability, large-scale ascent and
moderate deep-layer shear should support a severe threat during the
afternoon and evening. Supercells would be possible, with isolated
large hail and wind damage. Tornadoes could also occur.

On Wednesday, the cold front is forecast to move southeastward into
the mid Mississippi Valley, and southward into the southern Plains.
Mid-level flow near the front will be southwesterly. Ahead of the
front, surface dewpoints should be from the 60s to the mid 70s F,
which will contribute to moderate instability by afternoon. Although
deep-layer shear is not expected to be that strong near the front,
the instability should be enough for isolated severe storms in areas
where strong surface heating occurs. Predictability is low
concerning where the greater severe threat will be.

On Thursday, the front is forecast to move into the Southeast.
Thunderstorm development will be possible by afternoon along and
ahead of the front, from the Texas Coastal Plain northeastward into
the Gulf Coast states. Although moderate instability should be in
place in some areas by afternoon, deep-layer shear is forecast to be
weak enough to keep any severe threat localized.

Mesoscale Discussion 1027
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0358 PM CDT Wed May 28 2025

Areas affected...central Texas

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 343...

Valid 282058Z - 282230Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 343
continues.

SUMMARY...Several supercells to persist through the afternoon with a
primary threat of large hail.

DISCUSSION...A few supercells have developed in central Texas and
have recently started to turn right. The north-easternmost storm has
recently produced baseball sized hail in Hamilton County, Texas. A
favorable environment persists south of this activity which should
maintain this threat through the afternoon and into the early
evening. Eventually, these storms may congeal as they move southeast
which would result in an increased severe wind threat. However, in
the near term, large hail is the primary threat. 

Farther southwest convective attempts continue but it remains
unclear whether additional mature supercells may develop. If they
do, a similar environment will support supercells capable of large
to very large hail, similar to the storms farther east.

Mesoscale Discussion 1026
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0338 PM CDT Wed May 28 2025

Areas affected...Parts of Far West Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 282038Z - 282215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...There is an increasing threat for large hail this
afternoon and evening across portions of Far West Texas.

DISCUSSION...SPC mesoanalysis has indicated that inhibition has
mostly eroded across portions of Far West Texas and some towers have
started to develop over the Davis Mountains. Current visible
satellite data suggests that any convection this afternoon/evening
will likely be confined to the Davis Mountain vicinity. As
destabilization continues this afternoon, expect at least one storm,
potentially a few storms, to develop over the higher terrain. RAP
forecast soundings and SPC mesoanalysis indicate effective shear
around 30 to 35 knots which could support a supercell threat. Large
hail will likely be the primary threat with storms quickly weakening
after peak heating. 

If a few strong storms develop with a threat which may persist for
several hours, a severe thunderstorm watch may be necessary, but
more than isolated coverage and a short duration threat seems
questionable at this time.

Mesoscale Discussion 1025
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0334 PM CDT Wed May 28 2025

Areas affected...Far southeast Colorado...far southwest Kansas...and
the Oklahoma Panhandle

Concerning...Tornado Watch 342...

Valid 282034Z - 282130Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 342 continues.

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms have developed in far southeastern Colorado
and the far western Oklahoma Panhandle this afternoon, with an
additional cluster of thunderstorms moving from far northwest
Kansas/eastern Colorado due southeast. These thunderstorms will be
capable of all hazards, including tornadoes -- particularly across
southern portions of WW 342 in the short term.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorms in the Oklahoma Panhandle/southwest
Kansas have developed west of an environment characterized by rich
boundary-layer moisture (mixing ratios ~13-14 g/kg), 35-40 kts of
deep-layer shear, and southeasterly surface winds. VAD wind profiles
from KDDC show some low-level curvature of the hodograph that will
support stronger low-level mesocyclones and potential tornado
development, and low-level shear is expected to increase into the
evening with the nocturnal low-level jet around and after sunset.
While convective interactions in the short term lead to some
uncertainty, the expectation is that any isolated/strong supercells
that emerge from the convective clusters will have increased tornado
potential heading into this evening. 

Further north in eastern Colorado/northwest Kansas, a cluster of
convection is moving south-southeastward through WW 342. These
storms will be moving into an increasingly unstable and sheared
environment, though current KGLD VAD wind profiles show mostly
straight-line hodographs that would favor splitting supercell
thunderstorms. These storms will be capable of all hazards, with the
threat increasing as they continue to progress south and east with
time.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 343
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
245 PM CDT Wed May 28 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Central and South-Central Texas

* Effective this Wednesday afternoon and evening from 245 PM
  until 1000 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail likely with isolated very large hail events
    to 2.5 inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...At least isolated severe storms including supercells
capable of large hail are expected this afternoon across the region,
as the air mass further destabilizes after early day storms.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 65
statute miles north and south of a line from 50 miles south
southwest of San Angelo TX to 20 miles southeast of Waco TX. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU3).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 341...WW 342...

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 600. Mean storm motion vector
29025.

Tropical Depression One-E Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP012025
300 PM CST Wed May 28 2025
 
Showers and thunderstorms associated with an area of low pressure 
have continued to become better organized over the past 12 hours. 
Some banding features have become more pronounced over the southern 
semi-circle. Recent scatterometer data depicts that the system now 
has a well-defined low-level center. Thus, the system is now 
classified as a tropical depression, the first of the eastern 
Pacific season. The initial intensity is set at 30 kt based on a 
T2.0 Dvorak classification from TAFB.
 
The initial estimated motion is northwest at 320/8 kt, although 
there is higher uncertainty in this motion given the recent 
low-level center formation. Models are in fairly good agreement 
that the system should continue northwest to north-northwest over 
the next few days within the low-level flow. Environmental 
conditions are favorable for strengthening over the next couple of 
days with warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear. After 
48 h the system is likely to enter a fairly harsh environment with 
drier mid-level air, cooler sea surface temperatures, and increasing 
wind shear which should induce a weakening trend. The latest model 
simulated IR satellite imagery shows that convection is likely to 
collapse by Saturday, and the system is forecast to become a remnant 
low and dissipate early next week.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 336
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
505 AM CDT Tue May 27 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  East and Southeast Louisiana
  Southern and Central Mississippi
  Coastal Waters

* Effective this Tuesday morning and afternoon from 505 AM until
  100 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

Mesoscale Discussion 0973
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0348 PM CDT Sun May 25 2025

Areas affected...TX Panhandle

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 252048Z - 252315Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Convective Initiation along a frontal zone appears
increasingly likely between 4-7pm CDT (21-00z).  Large hail appears
to be the primary threat, although the risk for severe gusts will
increase during the evening.

DISCUSSION...Visible-satellite imagery shows a gradual clumping of
cumulus along a front draped from southwest to northeast across the
TX Panhandle.  A patch of cirrus over eastern NM appears associated
with the leading edge of appreciable large-scale ascent from a
Desert Southwest upper trough.  As continued heating of a
moist/destabilizing boundary layer occurs this this afternoon,
expecting additional erosion of convective inhibition along the
boundary.  Modifying the 18z Amarillo raob for lower 80s deg F
temperatures and lower 60s dewpoints, yields around 2400 J/kg MLCAPE
and minimal MLCINH (-35 J/kg).  

Models continue to vary regarding timing/coverage of storm
development within this mesoscale corridor.  However, cloud trends
and forecaster experience imply at least isolated to widely
scattered storm development over the next 3 or so hours.  Depending
on timing/coverage of developing storms, a severe thunderstorm watch
will be considered.

Mesoscale Discussion 0972
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0333 PM CDT Sun May 25 2025

Areas affected...much of Arkansas into southern Tennessee and
northern Mississippi

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 322...

Valid 252033Z - 252200Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 322
continues.

SUMMARY...The severe risk continues across much of WW322. Damaging
winds remain the primary threat though some hail with more scattered
convection is also possible.

DISCUSSION...As of 2030 UTC, regional radar imagery showed gradual
intensification of the ongoing convective cluster across
northwestern portions of WW322. Continued upscale growth of this
cluster is likely this afternoon/evening as the expanding cold pool
continues to interact with a broad warm and unstable air mass south
of the East-West stationary front. The expectation continues to be
for one or more bowing clusters to emerge from this convection, and
spread eastward with a risk for damaging winds and perhaps an
embedded tornado or two.

Additional, more scattered, convection has also developed across
much of the warm sector this afternoon. Given the robust buoyancy
(3,000 J/kg of MLCAPE), some hail and occasional damaging winds are
also possible with these storms. However, the main risk is still
expected to be the broader complex over AR/TN maturing later into
the evening. Given the gradual intensification/organization, the
severe threat will continue to increase across much of WW322.

Mesoscale Discussion 0971
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0224 PM CDT Sun May 25 2025

Areas affected...northeast NM

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 251924Z - 252130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Storm development will initially focus near the higher
terrain before moving east atop the escarpment/plains.  Large
hail/severe gusts are possible.

DISCUSSION...Visible-satellite imagery shows towering cumulus over
the Sangre de Cristos and a swelling cumulus field along the I-25
corridor in a post-frontal regime.  Surface analysis indicates
temperatures have warmed into the mid 60s to lower 70s deg F with
upper 40s to lower 50s dewpoints.  Short-term model forecast
soundings and RAP-based Objective Analysis imply 750-1500 J/kg
MLCAPE across northeast NM.  A belt of 35-40 kt southwesterly 500-mb
flow will support storm organization as storms develop/mature into
slightly richer moisture with eastward movement later this
afternoon.  A few of the stronger storms may attain supercellular
characteristics and pose a risk for large hail.  Severe gusts could
become more prevalent if/once storms cluster and congeal east of
I-25 during the early evening before low-level lapse rates lessen
with the loss of heating.

Mesoscale Discussion 0970
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0215 PM CDT Sun May 25 2025

Areas affected...Atlantic Coast portions of SC and GA into the FL
Panhandle.

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 251915Z - 252115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered thunderstorms along multiple sea-breeze
boundaries will support a risk for occasional damaging gusts or
sporadic hail this afternoon. A WW is not expected.

DISCUSSION...As of 1915 UTC, regional radar and satellite showed
scattered to numerous thunderstorms erupting along the Atlantic
Coasts of GA and SC, extending southward across much of the FL
Peninsula. Driven largely by diurnal heating and localized
confluence along typical sea-breeze boundaries, a few stronger
multicells/clusters have been noted recently. With little in the way
of upper-level forcing for ascent, convection has been largely
unorganized and is expected to remain as such. However, additional
clustering may support stronger cold pool development with time.
This could allow for occasional damaging gusts and wet microbursts
given the high PWATs (~1.8-2 inches) air mass. Sporadic hail is also
possible with the more intense updrafts given around 2000 J/kg of
MLCAPE. While occasional damaging gusts and hail are possible, the
lack of broader upper-level support suggests the severe risk will be
transient/isolated. A WW is not expected this afternoon.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 321
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1145 PM CDT Sat May 24 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Far Northwest Arkansas
  Southern Kansas
  Far Southwest Missouri
  Northern Oklahoma

* Effective this Saturday night and Sunday morning from 1145 PM
  until 700 AM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2
    inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm coverage is expected to increase tonight
across northern OK into southern KS and adjacent portions of far
northwest AR and far southwest MO. Steep mid-level lapse rates and
strong vertical shear will support the potential for large hail.
Isolated damaging gusts are also possible, particularly across
southwestern KS where a potential bowing segment may move into the
region from the northwest.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 55
statute miles north and south of a line from 20 miles west southwest
of Garden City KS to 30 miles east of Grove OK. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU1).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.
