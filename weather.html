Mesoscale Discussion 0588
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0333 PM CDT Mon Apr 28 2025

Areas affected...Edwards Plateau into western/central Oklahoma

Concerning...Severe potential...Tornado Watch likely 

Valid 282033Z - 282300Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...A tornado watch will likely be needed this afternoon as
storms are expected to develop along the dryline in the next 2-3
hours. All severe hazards will be possible. The tornado threat will
steadily increase from late afternoon into the evening.

DISCUSSION...Signs of mid-level ascent have been evident across the
southern Plains with visible satellite showing increasing amounts of
mid/high-level clouds moving in from the southwest. As a shortwave
perturbation lifts northeastward this afternoon/evening, this ascent
and additional surface heating should erode capping along/near the
dryline. A high-based storm has already formed northeast of Fort
Stockton in the last hour. Additional storms are expected to develop
later this afternoon, perhaps within the next 2-3 hours.

The environment will be quite favorable for supercells capable of
all severe hazards. Very steep mid-level lapse rates were observed
within the High Plains region on this mornings soundings. Large to
potentially giant hail will be possible along with severe winds.
Tornadoes will also be possible, particularly from southwest
Oklahoma into the Texas Rolling Plains where dewpoints have remained
in the upper 60s/low 70s F. The tornado threat will steadily
increase with time as 850 mb winds increase east of the dryline from
late afternoon into the evening. A strong tornado cannot be ruled
out within this more favorable mesoscale zone.

Mesoscale Discussion 0587
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0328 PM CDT Mon Apr 28 2025

Areas affected...far southeast NE...southwest into central
IA...northwest MO...northeast KS

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 282028Z - 282300Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...Widely scattered thunderstorms will pose a risk for a few
tornadoes (a couple strong), large to very large hail (up to 3 inch
diameter), and isolated damaging gusts through evening. A tornado
watch will likely be needed for portions of the discussion area from
central Iowa into northeast Kansas.

DISCUSSION...Deepening cumulus is noted along a dryline from eastern
NE/northwest IA southward into northeast KS. An 18z RAOB from OAX
indicated an EML around 700 mb, but only weak capping remained.
Additional heating into the low/mid 80s F amid mid/upper 60s F
dewpoints beneath steep midlevel lapse rates around 7.5-8.5 C/km 
immediately downstream from the surface dryline is support strong
instability with MLCAPE greater than 2000 J/kg noted in latest SPC
Mesoanalysis and the 18z OAX RAOB. In addition to this this
favorable thermodynamic environment, vertical shear is very
favorable for supercell thunderstorms, as evident in enlarged,
looping low-level hodographs becoming somewhat elongated above 2-3
km. 

Large-scale ascent will remain somewhat weaker with southward extent
into the MO Valley vicinity, and storm coverage is a bit uncertain,
especially with southward extent. Timing of convective initiation is
also uncertain, but seems most likely in the 22-00z time frame.
Regardless, any storms developing in this environment will likely
have robust updrafts and become intense, posing a risk for very
large hail, a few tornadoes and damaging gusts. A tornado watch will
likely be needed for portions of the MCD area in the next 1-2 hours.

Mesoscale Discussion 0586
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0225 PM CDT Mon Apr 28 2025

Areas affected...central/southeast MN...western WI...northern IA

Concerning...Severe potential...Tornado Watch likely 

Valid 281925Z - 282130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...Severe thunderstorm potential will increase through late
afternoon. All severe hazards, including tornadoes (some strong),
very large hail (to 3 inch diameter) and damaging gusts (to 70 mph)
are possible.

DISCUSSION...A line of convection along a surface front across
southwest MN into northwest IA will continue to shift east/northeast
this afternoon. Ahead of this convection, the downstream airmass
across central/southeast MN, northern IA and western WI continues to
moisten and destabilize. Surface dewpoints have increased into the
low to mid 60s as far north as the Minneapolis metro area, with
upper 50s to near 60 F to the north and east. Continued northward
moisture transport on a 50+ kt low level jet should continue to aid
in further destabilization over the next few hours as large-scale
ascent overspreads the region. 

Region VWP data from KMPX/KDMX/KARX already show impressive vertical
shear favorable for supercells. Enlarged, curved low-level
hodographs amid the strengthening low-level jet is aiding in 0-1 km
SRH greater than 250 m2/s2. As weak MLCIN continues to erode,
convection moving into this environment is likely to become better
organized, with an increase in storm coverage expected into northern
IA. Intense convection is expected to move across the MCD from late
this afternoon into this evening, posing an all-hazards severe risk.
A tornado watch will likely be needed in the next 1-2 hours.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0257 PM CDT Mon Apr 28 2025

Valid 282000Z - 291200Z

...THERE IS A MODERATE RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON
INTO EARLY TONIGHT FOR SOUTHEAST MINNESOTA...NORTHERN IOWA AND
WESTERN WISCONSIN...

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR NORTHWEST
TEXAS AND SOUTHWEST/SOUTH-CENTRAL OKLAHOMA LATE THIS AFTERNOON INTO
EARLY TONIGHT...

...SUMMARY...
Multiple corridors of severe thunderstorms are expected across the
Upper Midwest this afternoon into tonight, with a regional severe
weather outbreak possible. The most dangerous period is likely
during the late afternoon and evening when strong tornado potential
should be maximized. Scattered large to very large hail and damaging
winds are likely as well.

...IA/MN/WI through early tonight...
A positive-tilt midlevel trough and associated 70-80 kt jet streak
will eject quickly northeastward from the mid MO Valley to the upper
MS Valley this evening.  An associated surface cyclone will likewise
move across MN/WI, while a trailing cold front moves southeastward
into the central Plains, and a dryline mixes eastward into northwest
IA/far eastern NE before stalling this evening. Storms are ongoing
along the front moving across southern MN, where cloud breaks and
moisture advection have resulted in substantial destabilization. 
Long, sufficiently curved hodographs will support a threat for large
hail (potential greater than 2 inches) and tornadoes, with the
threat for strong tornadoes maximized for storms that remain
semi-discrete within the broken band.  Otherwise, convection will
spread eastward through early tonight into WI, with all hazards
possible.  

Farther south, storm development is less certain along the dryline
into western/central IA and northeast KS.  Deepening cumulus along
segments of the dryline in eastern NE and central KS could be
precursors to isolated storm development late this afternoon/evening
into western IA and northeast KS, respectively.  The storm
environment will conditionally favor supercells capable of producing
very large hail and a few tornadoes.  

...TX/OK through early tonight...
Despite a narrow band of thicker mid-high clouds, surface
temperatures continue to warm into the 85-90 F range along the
dryline across west central/northwest TX.  As surface heating
removes convective inhibition, flow near 700 mb largely parallel to
the dryline suggests sufficient residence times for storm initiation
near or after 22z across northwest TX.  Boundary-layer dewpoints of
65-70 F beneath midlevel lapse rates in excess of 8.5 C/km will
contribute to large buoyancy (MLCAPE near 3500 J/kg), while
deep-layer shear will be favorable for splitting supercells.  The
initial, more discrete storms will pose a primary threat of very
large hail of 2.5 to 3+ inches in diameter.  Though low-level shear
will be modest this afternoon, some increase in low-level shear this
evening in the zone of richer moisture near the Red River will allow
a window of opportunity for tornadoes.  Eventual upscale growth into
an MCS is expected with an accompanying threat for large hail and
damaging winds.

..Thompson.. 04/28/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1123 AM CDT Mon Apr 28 2025/

...Upper MS Valley...
Morning water vapor imagery shows a broad positively tilted upper
trough across the western states, with the band of primary mid-level
winds extending from the central Rockies into the upper MS Valley. 
Embedded within the stronger flow, a progressive shortwave trough is
evident over KS/NE that will track into IA/MN/WI this afternoon and
evening.  Strong large-scale forcing ahead of this feature will
result in scattered intense thunderstorms.

Strong southerly low-level winds are transporting mid 60s dewpoints
rapidly northward into IA/MN.  Cloud cover is limiting daytime
heating, but sufficient destabilization from cooling/ascent aloft
will lead to convective initiation along/ahead of the surface cold
front by mid-afternoon.  Storms will be most numerous over central
MN, with increasingly sparse development with southward extent
across IA.  Supercells capable of strong tornadoes and very large
hail appear likely.  Storms will track into western WI during the
evening with a continued risk of significant severe weather.

...Northern MO...
Several morning CAM solutions suggest a secondary area of concern
for discrete supercell storms over northwest MO and vicinity.  While
low and mid-level wind fields are a little weaker in this area
compared to farther north, forecast hodographs remain favorable for
tornadoes.  Have therefore extended the 10% SIG tornado
probabilities that far south.

...OK/TX...
Strong heating occurring along a dryline that will extend from
western OK into west TX.  Large-scale forcing mechanisms are weak
across this region, but a consensus of CAM solutions show scattered
intense thunderstorm development over southwest OK/northwest TX by
mid-afternoon, and further development southward during the evening.
Very large hail and a few tornadoes are possible across this region.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0250 PM CDT Mon Apr 28 2025

Valid 291200Z - 301200Z

...Day 2 Update...
Elevated Fire weather concerns will remain across southern New
Mexico and far West Texas as modest mid-level flow aloft over a very
dry, well-mixed boundary layer remains in place. Extended Elevated
highlights into the Davis Mountains/Big Bend areas based on latest
model guidance consensus and existing dry fuels.

...Coastal Mid-Atlantic...
A tightening pressure gradient over the Mid-Atlantic region in
response to an approaching trough will promote accelerating surface
winds from the south and southwest Tuesday. Although dewpoints will
be increasing through the day, above normal temperatures well into
the upper 70s to lower 80s will support relative humidity 25-30
percent range by early afternoon. The relatively warm and dry air
mass combined with southwest winds of 15-20 mph will promote
elevated fire weather conditions across New Jersey and adjacent
areas of southeast Pennsylvania and far southern New York.

..Williams.. 04/28/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0200 AM CDT Mon Apr 28 2025/

...Synopsis...
Ahead of a midlevel trough moving eastward across the Southwest,
moderate southwesterly flow aloft will overspread the southern
Rockies and adjacent High Plains. Here, boundary-layer mixing along
the western periphery of a deepening lee cyclone over the TX
Trans-Pecos will favor dry/breezy conditions across southern NM.
Sustained surface winds of 15-20 mph amid 10 percent RH will yield
elevated to locally critical fire-weather conditions. 

Additionally, isolated high-based thunderstorms cannot be entirely
ruled out across portions of northern/central NM -- ahead of the
approaching midlevel trough. While this may promote a localized risk
of dry thunderstorms, confidence in sufficient coverage of storms
over dry fuels is too low to add Dry Thunderstorm highlights at this
time.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0223 PM CDT Mon Apr 28 2025

Valid 301200Z - 011200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS IN PARTS OF THE
SOUTHERN GREAT PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are possible on Wednesday, centered
on central Texas to eastern Oklahoma and western Arkansas.

...Synopsis...
A southern-stream shortwave trough centered over NM will accelerate
east-northeastward, reaching the Ozarks by 12Z Thursday. A weak
surface cyclone over west TX should deepen slightly as it ejects
towards the Lower MO Valley. A cold to quasi-stationary front on D2
will advance north as a warm front across the Lower MO/OH Valleys
and Midwest.

...Southern Great Plains...
An MCS will likely be ongoing at 12Z Wednesday, centered over
western north TX to southwest OK, along the trailing portion of the
convectively modulated quasi-stationary front. Low-level warm
theta-e advection should persist through the diurnal heating cycle
as the aforementioned shortwave trough accelerates east.
Boundary-layer heating of the extensive rich low-level moisture
plume downstream will likely support intensification of the MCS and
additional development along its outflows through the afternoon. A
mix of all hazards is possible, but damaging winds may be the
primary threat given probable MCS/cluster mode. 

In its wake, late-afternoon storm development still seems probable
in parts of central TX along the eastward-surging dryline. Primary
uncertainty is with respect to the degree of outflow surge related
to the morning MCS and where exactly the best corridor of supercell
development may be near the outflow/dryline intersection. As such, a
10% or greater significant severe area has been withheld for now.
Isolated severe hail may also accompany the mid-level trough passage
over the TX Panhandle.

...Lower MO/OH Valleys...
Severe-thunderstorm potential is evident on Wednesday afternoon to
early evening along/south of the aforementioned warm front advancing
north. Mid-level lapse rates should be modest, yielding minimal
MLCIN by peak heating. A plume of moderate buoyancy combined with
moderate to strong deep-layer shear should support a few supercells
within a weakly forced regime. A mix of at least isolated damaging
winds and large hail is plausible, with a tornado or two possible
along the front.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1225 PM CDT Mon Apr 28 2025

Valid 291200Z - 301200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS IN OH TO
WESTERN NY AND PARTS OF WEST TX TO SOUTHWEST OK...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are possible within a broad swath
from the Lower Great Lakes to the southern High Plains, mainly
during the afternoon to evening on Tuesday. More probable corridors
of greater threat are apparent over the Upper Ohio Valley/Lower
Great Lakes and in parts of west Texas into southwest Oklahoma.

...Synopsis...
A consolidated shortwave trough will accelerate eastward across the
Great Lakes and southeast Canada, while a southern-stream trough
over the Southwest to northwest Mexico slowly moves east. Primary
surface low near the northern ON/QC border will quickly progress
towards the Canadian Maritimes. An attendant cold front will push
across the Lower Great Lakes Tuesday afternoon and evening. A weaker
surface low should remain anchored over the TX Trans-Pecos. 

...OH Valley and Lower Great Lakes...
Forecast scenario is marred by uncertainty regarding evolution of
remnant convection on Tuesday morning in the Midwest to Lower OH
Valley, and signals for weaker mid-level lapse rates/instability
relative to yesterday. Consensus of guidance suggests this morning
convection should persist east and strengthen early in the diurnal
heating cycle into the Upper OH Valley along related large-scale
outflow. This could temper the northern extent of overall
severe-storm coverage/intensity, as destabilization ahead of the
cold front becomes limited. A distinct outlier in guidance, the 12Z
ARW-NSSL, still indicates a favorable scenario for a more widespread
wind and embedded hail threat, centered on the level 3-ENH risk
area. The northern extent of the severe threat appears more
conditional, but a few supercells remain possible with strong
deep-layer shear and greater large-scale ascent in the lee of the
Lower Great Lakes. 

...West TX to the Ozarks...
Multiple rounds of thunderstorms are expected through the period
along a quasi-stationary front that should shift slowly south via
convective outflows. With persistent moderate to strong mid-level
southwesterlies downstream of the AZ/NM trough, supercells and
organized clusters are anticipated along the baroclinic zone. Peak
severe threat should remain diurnally driven as differential heating
across the composite front/outflows increases. The most probable
corridor for supercells producing very large hail and a couple
tornadoes appears to be from parts of the Permian Basin into
southwest OK during the late afternoon. This activity should
consolidate into broad clusters/MCSs by early evening with
small-scale bowing structures possible. This should support isolated
to scattered severe gusts as well before convection subsides.
Another round of isolated severe is expected in the Permian Basin/TX
South Plains vicinity Tuesday night, as the low-level jet
strengthens south of the convectively modulated front.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1148 AM CDT Mon Apr 28 2025

Valid 281700Z - 291200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHERN NEW MEXICO INTO THE FAR
WESTERN TRANS-PECOS...

...Lower Peninsula of Michigan...
Current surface observations and short term model guidance suggests
at least a brief period of elevated fire weather conditions across
the Lower Peninsula of Michigan this afternoon. Substantial
advection of low-level upstream moisture below 850 mb is not
expected until this evening as a warm front moves in from the
southwest. Relative humidity could fall to 20-25 percent range in
some areas with south winds of 15-20 mph this afternoon, so Elevated
highlights were added to the Lower Peninsula of Michigan.

...Southwest and portions of Southern High Plains...
Forecast remains on track with breezy southwest winds, low relative
humidity and dry fuels resulting in elevated to critical fire
weather conditions expected through today. An intensifying surface
lee trough across the Northern Plains will maintain breezy winds
across the High Plains of Colorado. Elevated highlights were
extended into far southeastern Colorado where minimal precipitation
has fallen amid dry fuels, enhanced winds and relative humidity
falling into the single digits are expected this afternoon.

..Williams.. 04/28/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0159 AM CDT Mon Apr 28 2025/

...Synopsis...
Downstream of an amplified large-scale trough over the West, a belt
of strong deep-layer southwesterly flow will overspread the southern
Rockies and adjacent High Plains. In the low-levels, a related lee
trough will deepen over the southern High Plains. 

...Southern New Mexico into the far western Trans-Pecos...
West of the lee trough, downslope flow amid a dry antecedent air
mass will promote deep boundary-layer mixing into the belt of
enhanced southwesterly flow aloft. At the same time, the pressure
gradient will tighten along the periphery of the deepening lee
trough during the afternoon. This will result in a corridor of 10-15
percent RH across much of the southern Rockies and adjacent High
Plains. These dry boundary-layer conditions, coupled with 20 mph
sustained southwesterly surface winds (with higher gusts), will
promote critical fire-weather conditions atop dry fuels over
southern New Mexico into the far western Trans-Pecos -- with
elevated conditions expected northward into southeast Colorado.

1125 AM CDT MON APR 28 2025

...Severe thunderstorms expected over parts of the Upper Midwest
later this afternoon through late evening...

* LOCATIONS...
  Southern Minnesota
  Western Wisconsin
  Northern Iowa

* HAZARDS...
  Several tornadoes, a few intense
  Scattered large hail, some baseball size
  Scattered damaging winds

* SUMMARY...
  Multiple corridors of severe thunderstorms are expected across
  the Upper Midwest later today into tonight, with a regional
  severe weather outbreak possible. The most dangerous period is
  likely during the late afternoon and evening when strong tornado
  potential should be maximized. Scattered large to very large
  hail and damaging winds are likely as well.

Preparedness actions...

Review your severe weather safety procedures for the possibility
of dangerous weather today. Stay tuned to NOAA Weather Radio, 
weather.gov, or other media for watches and warnings. A tornado
watch means that conditions are favorable for tornadoes to form
during the next several hours. If a tornado warning is issued for
your area, move to a place of safety, ideally in a basement or
interior room on the lowest floor of a sturdy building.

...THERE IS A MODERATE RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR SOUTHERN
MN...NORTHERN IA...AND WESTERN WI...

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM WESTERN OK
INTO THE TX BIG COUNTRY AND SOUTHWEST TX...

...SUMMARY...
Multiple corridors of severe thunderstorms are expected across the
Upper Midwest later today into tonight, with a regional severe
weather outbreak possible. The most dangerous period is likely
during the late afternoon and evening when strong tornado potential
should be maximized. Scattered large to very large hail and damaging
winds are likely as well.

...Upper MS Valley...
Morning water vapor imagery shows a broad positively tilted upper
trough across the western states, with the band of primary mid-level
winds extending from the central Rockies into the upper MS Valley. 
Embedded within the stronger flow, a progressive shortwave trough is
evident over KS/NE that will track into IA/MN/WI this afternoon and
evening.  Strong large-scale forcing ahead of this feature will
result in scattered intense thunderstorms.

Strong southerly low-level winds are transporting mid 60s dewpoints
rapidly northward into IA/MN.  Cloud cover is limiting daytime
heating, but sufficient destabilization from cooling/ascent aloft
will lead to convective initiation along/ahead of the surface cold
front by mid-afternoon.  Storms will be most numerous over central
MN, with increasingly sparse development with southward extent
across IA.  Supercells capable of strong tornadoes and very large
hail appear likely.  Storms will track into western WI during the
evening with a continued risk of significant severe weather.

...Northern MO...
Several morning CAM solutions suggest a secondary area of concern
for discrete supercell storms over northwest MO and vicinity.  While
low and mid-level wind fields are a little weaker in this area
compared to farther north, forecast hodographs remain favorable for
tornadoes.  Have therefore extended the 10% SIG tornado
probabilities that far south.

...OK/TX...
Strong heating occurring along a dryline that will extend from
western OK into west TX.  Large-scale forcing mechanisms are weak
across this region, but a consensus of CAM solutions show scattered
intense thunderstorm development over southwest OK/northwest TX by
mid-afternoon, and further development southward during the evening.
Very large hail and a few tornadoes are possible across this region.

Valid 281300Z - 291200Z

...THERE IS A MODERATE RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR SOUTHERN
MN...NORTHERN IA...AND WESTERN WI...

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM
NORTH-CENTRAL AND WESTERN OK INTO THE TX BIG COUNTRY AND SOUTHWEST
TX...

...SUMMARY...
Multiple corridors of severe thunderstorms are expected across the
Upper Midwest later today into tonight, with a regional severe
weather outbreak possible. The most dangerous period is likely
during the late afternoon and evening when strong tornado potential
should be maximized. Scattered large to very large hail and damaging
winds are likely as well.

...Synopsis...
Recent satellite imagery shows a mature cyclone centered over UT,
with a shortwave trough progressing northeastward through the
central High Plains within the eastern periphery of this cyclone.
Farther north, overnight convection across SD has contributed to the
development of vorticity maximum, which is currently moving into
western MN. 

Early morning surface analysis places a deep low over central SD,
with a dryline extending south-southwestward from this low across
central NE, western KS, the northwest TX Panhandle, southeast NM,
and far West TX. A warm front extends eastward from this low to the
ND/SD/MN border vicinity before then arcing more southeastward
across southwest MN, central IA, and eastern MO. A large warm sector
characterized largely by 60s dewpoints exists between these two
features. 

Expectation for the central High Plains shortwave trough to progress
quickly northeastward throughout the period, accompanied by a strong
jet streak (i.e. 70 to 80 kt at 500 mb). The surface low will eject
northeastward as well, reaching central MN by 00Z and continuing
into northwestern Ontario by 12Z Tuesday. Coincident
northward/northeastward movement of the warm front will bring a
warm, moist, and unstable airmass into the Upper Midwest ahead of
the approaching dryline, which will likely extend from central MN
southwestward into the TX Permian Basin by mid-afternoon. Severe
thunderstorms are expected to develop along the length of this
dryline, with the greatest severe potential across the Upper
Midwest.

...Upper Midwest...
A regional severe weather outbreak still appears possible across the
Upper Midwest, with a threat of strong to intense tornadoes, very
large hail, and swaths of damaging winds.

Convective line ongoing across central MN is expected to continue
quickly northeastward through the region, leaving ample time for the
warm front to progress northward and bring a warm, moist, and
unstable airmass into the region ahead of the dryline. Thunderstorm
initiation along the dryline is forecast to begin around 18-20Z near
the SD/MN/IA border intersection vicinity, before then continuing
quickly eastward across southern MN and northern IA throughout the
late afternoon and early evening. Volatile environmental conditions
are expected south of the warm front and east of the dryline, with
strong instability (MLCAPE near/above 3000 J/kg) and deep-layer
shear, and a persistently intense low-level jet that will maintain
very favorable low-level shear/SRH. 

This environment will be conditionally favorable for long-track
supercells with strong/intense tornado potential if a discrete mode
can be maintained. Quick upscale growth into a more linear or
cluster mode is possible, but the vertical shear appears strong
enough for a discrete mode to be maintained as well. A scenario
where a primary line develops with discrete storms ahead of it is
possible as well. In any case, the overall environment supports the
potential for large to very large hail, damaging gusts, and strong
to intense tornadoes with any discrete storms. Line-embedded
tornadoes and strong gusts are possible within any convective lines.

A more conditional scenario exists farther south from central IA
into northeast KS/northwest MO. Here, the kinematic environment will
remain supportive of supercells capable of all severe hazards, but
capping could prove detrimental to deep convection given the weaker
low-level convergence and large-scale ascent. Any supercell that can
initiate and be sustained could become long-tracked within the
expanding and very favorable warm sector, posing a threat for strong
to intense tornadoes and very large hail.

Farther west, a couple of supercells may develop in the region
between the prefrontal trough/dryline and cold front, and pose a
threat of large hail and locally damaging gusts as they move across
northeast NE/southeast SD into parts of MN/IA. 

...Western/Central OK...Northwest/Southwest TX...
Daytime heating, and resultant airmass destabilization, coupled with
convergence along the dryline is expected to result in convective
initiation from the TX Big Country into southwest TX during the
afternoon. Steep lapse rates and strong vertical shear will support
supercells, with large to very large hail as the primary severe
risk. 

Farther north in western OK, convective development will likely wait
until around 00Z when the dryline begins to retreat. The increased
low-level moisture coupled with a reduction in convective inhibition
could result in a 2-4 hour window where convective initiation is
more likely. At the same time, the low-level jet is forecast to
strengthen considerably, resulting in a kinematic environment
supportive of supercells. The tornado threat would likely maximize
between 00-04Z before nocturnal stabilization forces storms to
become more elevated. Hail potential could persist into
north-central OK as any storms that develop progress northeastward
throughout the night.

eastern US and a surface low tracking northeastward across the Great
Lakes. A cold front will stretch from the northeastern US southward
into the southern Plains, shifting eastward on D4/Thursday across
the Ohio Valley into the southeastern US. Beyond D4/Thursday,
heights will begin to rise across the Plains as an upper level high
strengthens, which will limit the severe threat through the end of
the extended.

...D4/Thursday - Tennessee and Ohio Valley...
On D4/Thursday, thunderstorm development is expected along the cold
front across portions of the Ohio Valley into the southern
Mississippi Valley. Model solutions differ on how much instability
will be available across Tennessee into the Ohio Valley, where the
strongest flow aloft will reside. There appears to be little overlap
between the better flow aloft and any meaningful instability, which
keeps probabilities too low to include areas in the extended.
However, some instances of wind and hail from stronger storms will
be possible across portions of Tennessee into Ohio.

...D5/Friday - Southwest Texas...
Thunderstorm development is possible along the dryline in
southwestern Texas on D5/Friday. During this period, heights aloft
will be rising, which will likely work to limit overall coverage of
thunderstorm activity. Nonetheless, a few isolated supercells may
develop with potential for large hail and severe wind. Overall,
limited coverage does not warrant inclusion of probabilities.

Day 3 Convective Outlook CORR 1
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0317 AM CDT Mon Apr 28 2025

Valid 301200Z - 011200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS PORTIONS OF
NORTH-CENTRAL TEXAS INTO SOUTHERN OKLAHOMA...

CORRECTED FOR INCORRECT DAY REFERENCE

...SUMMARY...
Widely scattered thunderstorm activity is expected from the southern
Plains to the Great Lakes on Wednesday as a mid-level trough ejects
into the southern Plains. Severe thunderstorms will be possible
across east-central Texas into central/eastern Oklahoma.

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will eject across the southern Plains on Tuesday.
Surface low development is expected across western Texas on
D2-Tuesday, with a weak low tracking eastward into east-central
Texas by the D3-Wednesday period. Overnight thunderstorm activity is
expected at the beginning of the D3 period across portions of
central Oklahoma into east-central Texas. By the afternoon,
additional scattered thunderstorm development along the dryline near
the Red River on Wednesday afternoon will pose potential for severe
wind, hail, and a tornado.

...East-Central Texas into southern Oklahoma...
Scattered thunderstorm development along the dryline across central
Texas into Oklahoma on Wednesday afternoon will pose some severe
potential. Some uncertainty arises in coverage of morning convection
and cloud cover. However, it appears a corridor of favorable
instability and shear will overlap by the afternoon along and ahead
of the dryline. Shear profiles will be supportive of supercells
before clusters begin to form and attempts at upscale growth occur.
Large hail and damaging wind will be the primary risks given steep
lapse rates, though forecast soundings do show some curvature of low
level hodographs favorable for some tornado risk with early
supercell modes.

Mesoscale Discussion 0577
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0349 PM CDT Sun Apr 27 2025

Areas affected...parts of nw TX into the TX Pnhdl

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 272049Z - 272245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Probabilities for thunderstorm development appear low, but
may not be negligible late this afternoon into early evening, with
the environment conditionally supportive of supercells posing a risk
for large hail and tornadoes.  If and when it becomes more certain
that storms will form, a severe weather watch will probably be
needed.

DISCUSSION...Boundary-layer moisture characterized by lower/mid 60s
surface dew points is being maintained across the Lubbock through
Amarillo vicinities, beneath a deep warm elevated mixed-layer based
between 850-700 mb, just east of a dryline which may mix only slowly
northeastward/eastward into early evening.  This appears to be
contributing to strong potential instability (3000+ J/kg), beneath
moderate to strong southwesterly mid/upper flow (including 40-70+ kt
in the 500-300 mb layer), and an environment conditionally
supportive of intense supercells.

Perhaps due to the warm/dry air at mid-levels, and weak large-scale
forcing for ascent, convection allowing guidance, in particular,
continues to indicate generally low potential for thunderstorm
initiation through early evening.  However, at least attempts at
deepening convective development are evident to the west of the
dryline, and objective analysis indicates a possible secondary
maximum in dryline convergence developing near/north of Lubbock
toward areas west of Amarillo.   

Of particular concern, if a sustained storm does develop during the
next couple of hours, there appears potential for rapid
intensification while propagating across the dryline.  Toward
23-00Z, strengthening south-southeasterly low-level flow (in excess
of 30 kt around 850 mb) may contribute to enlarging clockwise curved
low-level hodographs increasingly supportive of potential for
tornadoes, in addition to large, potentially damaging hail.

Mesoscale Discussion 0576
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0347 PM CDT Sun Apr 27 2025

Areas affected...Western Kansas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 272047Z - 272245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Watch issuance in western Kansas is currently unlikely.
Significant severe would be possible if storms develop.
Observational trends will be monitored.

DISCUSSION...Periodic enhancement to the cumulus field in western
Kansas has been noted in day cloud phase satellite imagery,
primarily in the vicinity of Goodland. Low 60s F dewpoints ahead of
the surface trough/modest dryline has allowed around 2500 J/kg
MLCAPE to develop. With the generally weak dryline circulation and
uncertain/subtle mid-level ascent, the development of deep
convection is far from a given. Only the more aggressive of the CAM
models suggests development later this afternoon. However, despite
this uncertainty, the environment will be conditionally favorable
for significant severe if storms can form. Supercells would be
likely given 40-45 kts of effective shear perpendicular to the
dryline. Furthermore, a strong increase in 850 mb winds after 00Z
would support a tornado threat.

Watch issuance appears unlikely at this time, but observational
trends (including observed sounding data) will be monitored over the
next few hours.

Areas affected...2Nebraska Panhandle into the Sandhills and
Southwest Nebraska

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 272029Z - 272230Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated to widely scattered supercell potential should
increase over the next 2-3 hours. Large/very-large hail and severe
gusts will be possible. The tornado threat will initially be low,
but will increase for storms persisting near/after sunset. Trends
will be monitored for watch issuance.

DISCUSSION...As the lee trough continues to deepen this afternoon,
clusters of cumulus clouds have begun to develop in northeast
Colorado. With time and the approach of a shortwave trough, a
surface low will become more evident in eastern Colorado. Low 60s F
dewpoints have already reached parts of northwest Kansas and should
continue north and west as low-level winds respond to the surface
cyclone.

Effective shear of around 45 kts across the trough axis will promote
discrete storm development. Steep mid-level lapse rates and
initially long, straight hodographs will promote a risk for
large/very-large hail and severe winds. As the low-level jet
increases this evening, any mature supercells ongoing will have an
increased potential to produce a tornado. Storm coverage is somewhat
uncertain, but isolated to widely scattered supercells appear
possible given at least modest mid-level ascent expected over the
next few hours.

Mesoscale Discussion 0574
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0255 PM CDT Sun Apr 27 2025

Areas affected...,parts of swrn TX

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 271955Z - 272100Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...The initiation of a couple of storms appears increasingly
likely near and northwest through north of Fort Stockton through 4-5
PM CDT.  More rapid thunderstorm intensification accompanied by
increasing potential for large hail and locally damaging wind gusts
may be initially slow, before probably increasing toward early
evening around the Midland through Big Spring vicinities.

DISCUSSION...The boundary-layer is becoming strongly heated and
deeply mixed across the Davis Mountains vicinity of southwest Texas
into the Texas South Plains.  The dryline is sharpening east through
north of Fort Stockton, where 2-hourly surface pressure falls around
2.0+ mb have been observed the past couple of hours, and low-level
convergence appears strongest.

Deepening convective development is ongoing within the deeper
mixed-boundary layer around Fort Stockton, where surface
temperature/dew point spreads are around 50 F (95/44), but forecast
soundings and HREF guidance suggests that the initiation of at least
isolated thunderstorm development is increasingly probable through
21-22Z.  It appears that this may be aided by forcing associated
with a mid-level speed maximum within southwesterly flow emanating
from the northern Mexican Plateau.

Downstream of slow moving large-scale mid-level troughing over the
southern Great Basin and Southwest, after at least some further
eastward mixing of the dryline late this afternoon, it probably will
begin to retreat northwest across the Pecos Valley vicinity toward
23-00Z.  As this occurs, convection may acquire more substantively
unstable updraft inflow (including most unstable CAPE up to
2000-3000+ J/kg), supporting increasing potential for rapid
thunderstorm intensification, in the presence of strong deep-layer
shear.  This may including a splitting supercell or two, posing a
risk for large hail and a few strong surface gusts.

Until then, though, initial thunderstorm development will probably
be more modest in strength, but could still pose some risk for
producing severe hail and wind.
