URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 712
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
350 PM CST Mon Nov 20 2023

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Southeastern Louisiana
  Southern and Central Mississippi

* Effective this Monday afternoon and evening from 350 PM until
  1100 PM CST.

* Primary threats include...
  A few tornadoes likely with a couple intense tornadoes possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph likely
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms will move eastward this afternoon and
evening while posing a threat for tornadoes, damaging winds, and
isolated hail. The threat for strong tornadoes will likely persist
with any sustained supercell.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 90 statute miles
north and south of a line from 30 miles north northwest of Natchez
MS to 45 miles north northeast of Pine Belt MS. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU2).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 711...

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 1.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 60 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 450. Mean
storm motion vector 26040.

Mesoscale Discussion 2279
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0847 PM CST Mon Nov 20 2023

Areas affected...southern Mississippi into southwest Alabama

Concerning...Tornado Watch 712...

Valid 210247Z - 210445Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 712 continues.

SUMMARY...A tornado or two remains possible this evening over
southern Mississippi, with a few damaging gusts possible as well.
The severe risk may eventually spread into parts of southwest
Alabama later tonight.

DISCUSSION...A broken line of storms including a few supercells
currently stretch east-central MS southwestward into southwest LA.
Deep-layer shear remain favorable to sustain cells this evening,
with effective SRH maximized over central MS currently. 

Persistent southerly winds in the lower 2 km will continue to aid
moisture advection, with upper 60s F dewpoints spreading north
across southwest AL ahead of the ongoing MS storms. A somewhat
stable air mass exists east of a batch of warm advection showers now
forming over southwest AL, and this general zone may be as far east
as the main severe risk gets tonight. 

As cells continue east across MS and approach the AL state line,
additional watches may be considered.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0656 PM CST Mon Nov 20 2023

Valid 210100Z - 211200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS
OF THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY...

...SUMMARY...
Tornadoes, a couple of which may be strong, scattered damaging
thunderstorm winds, and isolated large hail remain possible tonight
across portions of the lower Mississippi Valley.

...01z Update...

Primary change to 20z outlook is to lower severe probabilities along
the cool side of the progressive cold front.

Upper low centered over southeast KS continues its slow eastward
progression toward southern MO. As a result, high-level diffluent
flow has strengthened over the Gulf States. This appears partly
responsible for a corridor of severe deep convection that currently
extends from eastern LA into central MS. Within this corridor,
scattered supercells are observed, at least a few of these are
potentially tornadic. 00z sounding from JAN exhibited modest MLCAPE
(~800 J/kg) with very strong surface-6km shear (70kt), and 0-3km SRH
around 350 m2/s2. Some additional air mass recovery is expected
immediately downstream of this activity into western AL as primary
surface low lifts northeast into the OH Valley. While the primary
dynamic forcing will gradually shift north, southern portions of a
strong LLJ will shift east overnight which should allow the
aforementioned corridor of severe to advance across MS into western
AL.

Caribbean Sea (AL99):<br /> Disorganized showers and thunderstorms over
the central Caribbean <br /> Sea are associated with a small low
pressure area. Although the <br /> thunderstorm activity has recently
increased over the southwestern <br /> portion of the low, nearby dry
air is forecast to prevent much <br /> additional development of the
system as it begins to drift slowly <br /> westward over the next couple
of days. <br /> * Formation chance through 48 hours…low…10
percent.<br /> * Formation chance through 7 days…low…10 percent.<br />
<br /> 2. Central Subtropical Atlantic:<br /> An area of low pressure is
developing along a frontal boundary just <br /> to the southeast of
Bermuda. This non-tropical low is forecast to <br /> move southeastward
across the central subtropical Atlantic over <br /> warmer sea surface
temperatures during the next few days, and <br /> environmental
conditions appear conducive for this system to <br /> gradually acquire
tropical characteristics. A subtropical or <br /> tropical storm could
form by the latter part of this week, as the <br /> system continues
moving eastward followed by a turn northeastward by <br /> the
weekend.<br /> * Formation chance through 48 hours…low…10 percent.<br />
* Formation chance through 7 days…medium…50 percent.<br /> <br />

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0341 PM CST Mon Nov 20 2023

Valid 221200Z - 281200Z

Shortwave ridging across the central U.S. will give way to a trough
digging into the Southwest towards the end of this week. Thereafter,
model guidance suggests broad troughing will develop across much of
the CONUS into next weekend. Differences in the upper-level pattern
grow large beginning next week. At the surface, a cold front will
move into the northern/central Plains late this week. A secondary
push of cold air is expected to shove the front farther south by
early next week. High pressure will again become more prominent in
the West this weekend.

...Southern High Plains...
Some dry and windy conditions are possible this Thursday as a weak
surface low develops as the synoptic trough advances eastward. With
temperatures being cooler due to the earlier passage of a cold
front, RH values appear marginally low and winds may not be overly
strong. Coupled with fuels generally being unreceptive, fire weather
concerns are not likely to be more than locally elevated.

...Southern California...
Offshore flow is expected to return to the region this coming
weekend into Monday. Pressure gradient forecasts suggest potential
for near-critical meteorological conditions. Upper-level wind
support appears weak to modest. With dry conditions expected in the
interim, it is possible that some fire weather concerns could
develop. Fuel moisture trends will continue to be monitored.
Confidence in critical fire weather remains too low for highlights
this far in advance.
