Mesoscale Discussion 1963
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0720 AM CDT Sat Aug 16 2025

Areas affected...Southeast MN into western WI

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 595...

Valid 161220Z - 161345Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 595
continues.

SUMMARY...Some threat for locally damaging wind and isolated hail
may continue into mid morning.

DISCUSSION...An earlier compact bowing MCS has largely weakened this
morning across southern/central MN, after encountering extensive
preceding convection. A larger and more loosely organized MCS is
ongoing, aided in part by the remnant cold pool from the earlier
system. Favorable MUCAPE (2000-3000 J/kg) will help to maintain the
ongoing convection as it moves into western WI, though low-level
stability and strong MLCINH is expected to keep the short-term
damaging-wind threat rather isolated. Isolated hail also cannot be
ruled out with the strongest embedded cores. 

While cloudiness is extensive across the region, modest diurnal
heating may eventually allow for some intensification along the
southern and eastern periphery of the ongoing convection with time.
However, a more substantial uptick in the organized severe threat
may not evolve until late this morning or into the afternoon. In the
short term, WW issuance downstream of WW 595 is unlikely, unless
notable intensification occurs over the next 60-90 minutes.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging winds likely with isolated significant gusts
    to 85 mph possible
  Scattered large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...A fast-moving and intense cluster of thunderstorms over
southeast South Dakota will race eastward across the watch area
during the next several hours.  Locally damaging wind gusts,
including some potential for significant wind damage is expected.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 60
statute miles north and south of a line from 70 miles northwest of
Worthington MN to 40 miles southeast of Minneapolis MN. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU5).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 594...

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
1.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 75 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
27040.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0721 AM CDT Sat Aug 16 2025

Valid 161300Z - 171200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON AND
TONIGHT OVER PARTS OF SOUTH DAKOTA...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong/severe thunderstorms are possible today into
tonight across parts of the northern Great Plains into Midwest and
Great Lakes region.

...MN/Great Lakes Region...
A long-lived severe MCS that affected parts of SD and southwest MN
overnight has weakened in east-central MN.  These storms will track
eastward this morning into a region of moderate MUCAPE, but slightly
cooler/drier surface air over WI that was affected by one or more
areas of thunderstorms yesterday.  For this reason, these storms are
expected to struggle to organize, with locally gusty winds being the
main concern today.  Refer to MCD #1963 for further short-term
details.

Farther south across parts of IA/IL/IN, an overnight MCS pushed the
effective surface boundary south into northeast MO and central IL. 
Strong daytime heating and southerly low-level winds will help the
boundary to retreat back into northern IA/IL by mid-afternoon.  The
corridor along/north of the boundary should provide the greatest
potential for re-development of a few storms later today, with
locally damaging wind gusts possible.  Given the uncertainty of
where the boundary is, and anticipated limited coverage of storms,
will maintain MRGL risk at this time.

...SD and Vicinity...
A well-defined but rather weak shortwave trough is currently over
western CO and will spread into eastern WY/western Dakotas by
evening.  Similar to yesterday, high-based storms will develop ahead
of the approaching trough and intensify as they move eastward into a
progressively more moist/unstable air mass over west-central SD. 
Another nocturnal MCS may affect central/eastern SD tonight, with a
risk of damaging wind gusts and some hail.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0356 AM CDT Sat Aug 16 2025

Valid 191200Z - 241200Z

...DISCUSSION...
...Tuesday/Day 4 and Wednesday/Day 5...
A mid-level ridge will build across the Rockies and northern High
Plains during the middle part of the week. At the surface, a front
will advance slowly southward into the lower Missouri and mid
Mississippi Valleys. A post-frontal airmass will remain over the 
upper Mississippi and Great Lakes region. On the southern and
western periphery of this airmass, moderate instability is forecast
to develop each afternoon. Limited large-scale ascent is expected to
keep convective coverage isolated. In spite of relatively weak
deep-layer shear along much of the instability corridor, steep low
to mid-level lapse rates will be in place and could be enough for a
marginal severe threat in areas that destabilize the most.

...Thursday/Day 6 and Saturday/Day 8...
Mid-level zonal flow is forecast to develop on Thursday over much of
the north-central and northwestern U.S., as a ridge moves
southeastward into the western Great Lakes. A pocket of moderate
instability is forecast to develop ahead of a cold front on Thursday
in the northern Plains. Limited large-scale ascent should keep
convective coverage isolated. Although deep-layer shear is forecast
to be modest, any cell that can develop and persist near the
stronger instability in the late afternoon and early evening could
obtain an isolated severe threat.

On Friday an Saturday, a cold front is forecast to move
southeastward across the north-central U.S. Near and ahead of the
front, isolated thunderstorms will be possible each afternoon from
the upper Mississippi Valley into the Great Lakes region. The
combination of instability and shear could be sufficient for an
isolated severe threat. However, considerable uncertainty exists at
this range in the forecast.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0204 AM CDT Sat Aug 16 2025

Valid 171200Z - 181200Z

...Synopsis...
Across the US, broad ridging is forecast to expand while troughing
consolidates over the West. As height aloft build, very warm surface
temperatures are expected over parts of the southern and
Southwestern CONUS. A belt of stronger flow aloft will impinge on
the northern Rockies as the trough and a weak surface cold front
approach. Monsoon moisture should support dry thunderstorms, while
light winds and dry conditions will persist elsewhere Sunday.

...Northern Rockies Dry Thunder...
Troughing should continue to intensify as it moves into the Great
Basin and Rockies Sunday, as a cold front moves in from the west.
This will allow for additional monsoon moisture to filter northward,
supporting scattered showers and thunderstorms through the
afternoon. Despite PWATs climbing to near 0.8 to 1 inches, a mix of
wet and dry thunderstorms is expected ahead of the front from
northern CA into the Northern Rockies. While not as dry as previous
days, stronger flow aloft is expected ahead of the deepening trough.
This should allow for a favorable alignment of drier/more receptive
fuels and faster northeast thunderstorm motions to limit rainfall
across northern NV into central ID and western MT. Thus, isolated
dry lightning and ignitions are likely to remain a concern across
the receptive fuels beds of the northern Great Basin and Rockies
Sunday.

...Southern NV into southwest UT
South of the western US troughing and stronger flow aloft, another
day of dry and locally breezy conditions is expected over parts of
the southern Great Basin. While displaced from the stronger flow,
localized 15 mph surface winds and low RH below 15% are likely
across southern NV and southwest UT. With area fuels very dry and
receptive, some locally elevated fire-weather conditions are
possible, though widespread occurrence is unlikely owing to the
modest winds.

Mesoscale Discussion 1956
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0552 PM CDT Fri Aug 15 2025

Areas affected...portions of eastern/southeastern Iowa into
northwestern Illinois

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 590...

Valid 152252Z - 160015Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 590
continues.

SUMMARY...A well organized bowing cluster should continue across
southeastern IA into northwestern IL this evening. Damaging gusts
(some 70+ mph) are likely.

DISCUSSION...As of 2245 UTC, regional radar imagery shows a stronger
bowing cluster has emerged from the initial convection of storms
over eastern IA. Downstream, a very unstable environment (4000-5000
J/kg of SBCAPE) remains in place. While vertical shear (25-35 kt) is
expected to decrease with southern extent, evidence of an elevated
rear-inflow jet and a 20-25 deg F cold pool, along with the degree
of buoyancy suggest maintenance of this complex is likely for at
least a few more hours. With several gusts to 70+ mph observed over
the 60 minutes, damaging winds remain likely across
eastern/southeastern IA, into northwestern and possible
north-central IL this evening.

CAM guidance has not handled the convective evolution particularity
well thus far, with only a few outlier solutions capturing the
intensity of the bow. This lends lower confidence to the downstream
severe risk this evening. However, the continued favorable
environment and well-organized radar presentation of the system does
suggest at least some damaging wind potential may occur downstream
of the eastern edge of WW590 in IL tonight. Conditions will continue
to be monitored should an additional watch be needed later this
evening.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 591
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
525 PM CDT Fri Aug 15 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Southern Minnesota
  Western Wisconsin

* Effective this Friday afternoon and evening from 525 PM until
  1100 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  Scattered large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Strong to severe thunderstorms will continue to develop
across the region through early evening. Hail will be possible, and
at least isolated damaging wind potential will exist, especially as
storms merge/organize as they progress east-southeastward.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 35
statute miles north and south of a line from 35 miles north of
Redwood Falls MN to 55 miles east southeast of Eau Claire WI. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU1).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 590...

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
1.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 550. Mean storm motion vector
28025.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0458 PM CDT Fri Aug 15 2025

Valid 171200Z - 231200Z

...Day 3/Sunday...
A mid-level trough across the Pacific Northwest along with a diffuse
frontal boundary along a corridor of Pacific moisture will promote a
mix of wet and dry thunderstorms from northern CA into the Northern
Rockies. Alignment of drier, more receptive fuels and faster
northeast thunderstorm motions limiting rainfall are expected across
northern NV into central ID. A 10 percent dry thunderstorm
probability was maintained to cover this threat. A dry southwest
flow pattern between the Pacific Northwest trough and upper-level
ridge across the Southern U.S. will promote sustained
south-southwest winds of up to 15 mph along with low daytime
relative humidity of around 15 percent across southern NV amid very
dry fuels. However, widespread critical fire weather conditions are
not expected.

...Day 4/Monday - Day 8/Friday...
Mid-level troughing will moderate fire weather concerns across the
Northwestern U.S. early next week while the Southern U.S.
mid/upper-level ridge begins to shift and strengthen into the Four
Corners region. Ridging amplifies well into the Northern Rockies by
Day 5/Tuesday with gradual expansion and westward propagation into
the West Coast by Day 8/Friday. Above normal surface temperatures
will similarly expand across most of the western U.S. by the end of
next week. A return of monsoon moisture into the Intermountain West
could pose a dry thunderstorm threat across the eastern Great Basin
beginning on Day 6/Wednesday translating northward to include UT by
Day 7/Thursday and WY by Day 8/Friday. Uncertainty in magnitude of
moisture return and subsequent thunderstorm coverage precludes
introducing dry thunderstorm probabilities at this time.

Mesoscale Discussion 1954
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0349 PM CDT Fri Aug 15 2025

Areas affected...Central High Plains

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 152049Z - 152245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated severe winds and large hail will be possible with
storms that can move off the terrain into the High Plains. A watch
is not expected in the short term.

DISCUSSION...Mid-level ascent is evident on visible/water vapor
imagery this afternoon from the eastern Great Basin into the central
High Plains. Modest moisture (upper 40s/low 50s F) in eastern
Wyoming has allowed convection and widely scattered thunderstorms to
develop. Inhibition immediately to the east of this activity is
slowly weakening. Some this activity will likely move off the
terrain. Isolated severe wind gusts and large hail would be
possible. The observed 18Z UNR/LBF soundings do show stronger
inhibition into the Plains. While there is a signal in guidance for
convection to cluster and eventually intensify, this is not likely
to occur until early evening when MLCIN erodes farther east. At that
point, the low-level jet will focus in the region and mid-level
ascent will be marginally stronger. That said, a watch is not
anticipated in the short term.

0332 PM CDT Fri Aug 15 2025

Areas affected...central/eastern IA and adjacent WI/IL

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 589...590...

Valid 152032Z - 152200Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 589, 590
continues.

SUMMARY...Sporadic severe wind/hail will remain possible through
early evening as a linear cluster moves east-southeast from
north-central Iowa.

DISCUSSION...A short and generally west-southwest/east-northeast
oriented linear cluster has been progressing east-southeast at
around 35-40 kts. The temperature gradient between the cold pool and
the ambient warm-moist sector downstream has increased to 15-20 F.
Strong/near-severe gusts producing localized tree damage along with
marginally severe hail have been recently reported, and should
continue for at least a few more hours, especially on the
eastward-propagating portion of the cluster. Outflow is largely
ahead of the trailing westward portion, but not strongly surging, so
there is possibility for a bowing segment to surge southeastward.
Ongoing Severe Thunderstorm Watches appear to well handle the
overall threat, but some refinement could be needed based on
convective trends over the next 1-2 hours.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 589
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1230 PM CDT Fri Aug 15 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  North-Central Iowa

* Effective this Friday afternoon from 1230 PM until 500 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph likely
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Convective cluster ongoing across northwest IA has shown a
strengthening trend over the last hour or so as it moves into the
moist and destabilizing airmass downstream across north-central IA.
Isolated hail and scattered damaging gusts are possible with this
line as it moves over north-central IA this afternoon.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 60
statute miles north and south of a line from 40 miles west of Fort
Dodge IA to 50 miles south southeast of Mason City IA. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU9).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
1.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector

Valid 152000Z - 161200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THOUGH TONIGHT
FROM THE UPPER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY INTO SOUTH DAKOTA...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong to severe storms with damaging winds and large hail
are likely through tonight from the Upper Mississippi Valley into
South Dakota.

...Upper MS Valley through tonight...
Convection is ongoing in a cluster across north central IA, with
clear evidence of cold pool development and a bowing structure.  The
storms will likely continue to spread eastward/southeastward through
the afternoon while encountering a very unstable environment
characterized by surface temperatures in the upper 80s and
boundary-layer dewpoints in the low-mid 70s.  Cluster is expected to
be maintained given deep-layer shear vectors near 30 kt (oriented
west-northwest to east-southeast), and steep midlevel lapse rates
will support the potential for occasional damaging/severe outflow
gusts and isolated large hail with the strongest embedded updrafts.

Otherwise, a strengthening low-level warm advection regime will
develop tonight into MN along a slow-moving front, and atop the cold
pool from the ongoing IA storms.  Elevated buoyancy will remain
large, with the potential to support additional severe storm
development with occasional large hail and damaging/severe outflow
gusts. 

...NE/SD this evening into tonight...
High-based convection is expected to form this afternoon from
southeast WY into the western NE Panhandle and southwest SD.  The
initial storms will be capable of producing a few severe outflow
gusts in an environment with deep inverted-V profiles and modest
buoyancy.  Though surface convective inhibition will increase this
evening with diurnal cooling, storms could grow into a cluster
through outflow interactions, while moving into richer low-level
moisture and larger buoyancy with eastward extent (along and south
of a baroclinic zone across SD).

..Thompson.. 08/15/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1130 AM CDT Fri Aug 15 2025/

...MN/IA/WI...
Recent satellite imagery shows a pair of convectively generated
vorticity maxima moving across the northern/central Plains, with the
northernmost vorticity max over the eastern ND/SD border and the
southernmost vorticity max over north-central NE. Showers and
thunderstorms have persisted near these features over the last
several hours, but the strongest cells in both of these clusters
have recently shown a weakening trend. A moist and buoyant airmass,
characterized by dewpoints in the upper 60s/low 70s, exists
downstream and redevelopment is possible ahead of both of these
vorticity maxima. How that redevelopment evolves is uncertain, with
recent guidance offering varied solutions regarding overall coverage
and evolution. 

Redevelopment appears most probable with the southern vorticity
maxima, given the ample moist and buoyancy that exists downstream.
This development should grow upscale quickly, with the resulting
convective cluster then tracking southeastward. Recent guidance
continues to trend farther south, so the wind probabilities were
extended southward to cover this potential. Damaging gusts appear
like the most likely threat through the evening. Current progression
of the northern vorticity maximum takes it into a less buoyant
airmass across central MN and northern WI, and redevelopment
along/ahead of this disturbance appears less likely. 

Depending on the strength of the IA cluster, additional development
is possible in its wake amid a strengthening low-level jet and
associated warm-air advection over its outflow. Steep mid-level
lapse rates should still be in place, supporting strong updrafts and
large hail with these elevated storms. 

Lastly, a decaying convective line may reach the southwestern
MN/northwestern IA vicinity late in the period. Given the potential
for preceding storms, the amount of buoyancy that will still be in
place remains is uncertain. However, if thunderstorm coverage is low
or most storms develop farther east, enough buoyancy could remain to
support strong updrafts capable of damaging gusts and/or hail within
the convective line or any preceding more cellular storms.

..NE/SD this afternoon through tonight...
Strong heating and ample mid-level moisture will result in scattered
high-based thunderstorm development across eastern WY and western
NE/SD by late afternoon. Isolated hail and strong gusts are possible
with this initial activity. This activity will then track
east-northeastward through the early evening into a progressively
more moist and unstable air mass across NE and SD. The combination
of improving thermodynamic environment and an intensifying nocturnal
low-level jet will likely aid in thunderstorm intensification and
upscale growth through the evening across northern NE and central
SD. Guidance continues to vary significantly with the strength of
this MCS, but general consensus would suggest the threat for strong
to severe gusts will persist across SD tonight. There is at least a
low probability for the development of a well-organized MCS that
could produce significant severe gusts. However, that probability is
currently too low to introduce an unconditional sig wind area.

...TX Coastal Plain into the Hill Country and Southeast TX...
A maturing tropical disturbance is near south TX, with associated
outflow currently spreading northward across the TX Coastal Plain.
Limited lightning has been noted with in the short-lived cores that
have been developing along this outflow. This process of brief
intensification along this outflow is expected throughout the day,
with an overall increase in thunderstorm coverage anticipated. A
modest increase in low to mid-level flow is expected along the
eastern periphery of this system, spreading northward into central
and southeast TX. Even so, shear will remain weak, with a
disorganized multicellular pulse storm mode anticipated. Given the
very moist profiles (i.e. PW values over 2"), a few water-loaded
downbursts are possible, but should be isolated enough to preclude
the need for severe probabilities.

Valid 171200Z - 181200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM MONTANA
THROUGH THE UPPER MIDWEST AND SOUTHERN GREAT LAKES...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms with potential for isolated severe wind gusts and hail
will be possible on Sunday across parts of the northern Plains
eastward into Upper Midwest and southern Great Lakes.

...Northern Plains/Upper Midwest into the southern Great Lakes...
A flattened mid-level ridge will influence thunderstorm activity on
Sunday across a large part of the CONUS.  On the northern periphery
of the ridge, a weak mid-level disturbance is forecast to crest the
ridge over the north-central states and move from SD to the western
Great Lakes.  Warm 700-mb temperatures and an associated capping
inversion will likely limit storm development across the lower MO
Valley.  A composite surface boundary, likely modulated by previous
day's thunderstorm outflow, is forecast to be draped from the
southern Great Lakes west-northwestward into parts of the Upper
Midwest and into portions of the northern High Plains.  

Showers and storms may be ongoing early Sunday morning across the
Upper Midwest in association with weak low-level warm advection in
advance of the aforementioned impulse.  Isolated to scattered
diurnal storms are forecast to focus along the low-level boundary
during the afternoon/evening given large-scale upper forcing for
ascent will remain weak to negligible.  Despite expected strong
diurnal destabilization, deep-layer shear will likely remain modest
and limit storm organization potential, with isolated severe gusts
and large hail being the severe hazards.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR MUCH OF SOUTH
DAKOTA...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are possible Saturday over South
Dakota primarily during the late afternoon through the late evening
period.  Large hail and severe gusts appear to be the primary
hazards with the stronger storms.

...Northern Great Plains...
A mid-level ridge centered over the lower MS Valley/Mid South will
feature a weak disturbance moving from the WY/CO vicinity into the
Dakotas Saturday night.  A residual composite front will remain
draped east-west from the Upper Midwest into western SD, where it
will intersect a lee trough from the central High Plains
north-northwestward into eastern MT.  Although large-scale ascent
will remain fairly weak across the region, isolated thunderstorms
will likely develop in the vicinity of the lee trough and Black
Hills by the late afternoon as convective inhibition erodes.  To the
north of the front, a moist and unstable airmass featuring a
moderate to very unstable boundary layer will develop by mid-late
afternoon.  Model guidance shows a gradual increase in storm
coverage during the early evening over western/central SD.  Ample
directional shear will support effective shear magnitudes 30-40 kt
and storm organization with the stronger storms.  Large hail and
severe gusts appear to be the primary threats.

...Midwest...
A linear cluster of thunderstorms is expected to be ongoing Saturday
morning across parts of the Upper MS Valley/western Great Lakes. 
Model guidance differs on the evolution of this potentia
shower/thunderstorm activity, but west-northwesterly mid-level flow
poleward of a mid-level anticyclone centered over the lower MS
Valley, will potentially favor some continuation of storms
downstream across the southwestern Great Lakes.  Models continue to
show a moist/unstable airmass across southern portions of the Great
Lakes.  Although large-scale ascent will remain weak across the
region, regenerative storm development on remnant outflow may yield
a subsequent evolution of a storm cluster but uncertainty remains
high.  Isolated damaging gusts/hail are the main threats with these
storms.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1149 AM CDT Fri Aug 15 2025

Valid 151700Z - 161200Z

...Dry Thunderstorms...
Thermodynamic profiles continue to be supportive of dry thunderstorm
development over portions of Northeast NV into southern ID/western
WY and southward along the central UT mountain chain. Enhanced
southwesterly flow associated with a trough over the Great Basin
will support faster storm motions, particularly from a corridor from
northeastern Nevada into southeastern ID, further limiting rainfall
potential. A clearly evident, deeper moisture plume depicted by
satellite imagery currently translating northward from northern AZ
into eastern UT, should promote more wetting rain cores out of
expected higher terrain shower/thunderstorm development this
afternoon. PWATs across the Colorado Plateau and Western Slope
should remain at or above 0.80" limiting lightning ignition
efficiency in this region. Orographically forced convection and a
few thunderstorms with limited rainfall across the Central Sierra
Nevada mountains are also expected over increasingly dry fuels. 

...Southern Nevada, southeastern Idaho and far southwest Montana...
The mid-level trough will also support a swath of enhanced south to
southwest winds (15-20 mph) across southern and eastern NV as well
as portions of central ID mountains and Upper Snake River Plain. The
winds combined with a dry boundary layer and surface relative
humidity of 15% or below will promote elevated fire weather
conditions amid dry fuels.

..Williams.. 08/15/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0159 AM CDT Fri Aug 15 2025/

...Synopsis...
Broad mid-level ridging over the Central US is forecast to build
today, as weak westerly flow passes over it. Weak troughing over the
Great Basin will gradually shift eastward bolstering mid-level flow
over the region. A weak lee low over the High Plains will support
west/southwesterly winds over much of the Great Basin and
Intermountain West through this afternoon. 15-20 mph gusts will
overlap with very warm and dry conditions (RH below 15) from eastern
NV into portions of UT, WY and ID.  Several hours of elevated fire
weather conditions are probable given very dry and receptive fuels.

...Dry Thunder...
Weak height falls from the upper trough over the West will continue
to overspread robust monsoon moisture supporting isolated
thunderstorms this afternoon. Similar to previous days, a
combination of steep mid-level lapse rates and modest mid-level
moisture will overlap with dry boundary layer conditions and high
cloud bases. This will favor dry storms with limited potential for
wetting rainfall. The favorable thermodynamic conditions, coupled
with 15-25 knot storm motions over top receptive fuels will continue
to support dry lightning potential with these storms over the
eastern Great Basin and central Rockies.

Mesoscale Discussion 1950
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0752 AM CDT Fri Aug 15 2025

Areas affected...Parts of northeast NE into extreme northwest IA

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 151252Z - 151415Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...A threat for isolated hail and damaging gusts may continue
into mid morning.

DISCUSSION...A strong cell has recently evolved out of a storm
cluster across northeast NE. This storm appears to be associated
with an MCV that emerged out of the central High Plains. Steep lapse
rates were observed on regional 12Z soundings, and this cell could
continue to pose a threat of hail and localized strong gusts in the
short term as it moves east-northeastward within a favorably
unstable environment (with MUCAPE in excess of 2500 J/kg). 

The longevity of this storm this morning remains uncertain, due to
its evolution into a discrete cell, and a general tendency for
veering and weakening of the low-level jet with time. Recent
HRRR/RRFS guidance suggests that a more organized cluster may
eventually evolve downstream into northern IA in association with
this MCV, though such an evolution may not occur until late morning
or early afternoon, with the aid of diurnal destabilization.

Mesoscale Discussion 1949
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0701 AM CDT Fri Aug 15 2025

Areas affected...Northeast SD into extreme southeast ND/west-central
MN

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 151201Z - 151330Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated severe gusts and hail are possible this morning.

DISCUSSION...A small but relatively long-lived storm cluster has
recently intensified in the vicinity of a surface boundary across
northeast SD, as it has encountered increasingly favorable buoyancy
(with MUCAPE in excess of 3000 J/kg). The longevity of this cluster
is uncertain, due to its elevated nature and some increase in
downstream MUCINH noted in recent mesoanalysis estimates. Midlevel
flow of 25-35 kt will continue to provide somewhat favorable
effective shear for this cluster as long as it persists.

Strong to locally severe gusts have been reported with this cluster
over the last 60-90 minutes, and a threat for isolated damaging wind
may continue in the short term as this cluster approaches far
west-central MN. Hail in excess of 1-inch in diameter has also been
recently observed, and stronger embedded cells could continue to
pose an isolated hail threat, given the presence of steep midlevel
lapse rates and favorable buoyancy.

0240 PM CDT Thu Aug 14 2025

Areas affected...portions of extreme northeast Nevada into central
and northern Utah...southeastern Idaho...and southwestern into
central Wyoming

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 141940Z - 142215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms will pose a risk for strong to potentially
severe wind gusts through the afternoon and early evening hours.

DISCUSSION...High-based thunderstorms are developing atop a dry
boundary layer, where 40-50 T/Td spreads are already in place. RAP
forecast soundings, and the DPG 18Z observed sounding, all depict
inverted-v profiles extending up to 500 mb, with 20-40 kts of
southwesterly flow constrained to the buoyant/cloud-bearing layer.
Given 0-3 km lapse rates already exceeding 9 C/km in spots,
conditions are favorable for fast-moving thunderstorms capable of
producing dry downbursts, with strong erratic wind gusts possible. A
few of these gusts may exceed 50 kts. However, the overall severe
risk should remain widely scattered at best, so a Severe
Thunderstorm Watch issuance is not currently anticipated.

Mesoscale Discussion 1944
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0237 PM CDT Thu Aug 14 2025

Areas affected...southwest to central MN

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 141937Z - 142130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...A marginal severe threat might develop before early
evening within a few cells shifting slowly east from southwest
Minnesota. A Severe Thunderstorm Watch issuance is unlikely.

DISCUSSION...Along the backside of a remnant MCV moving from
south-central to southeast MN, lower-level warm theta-e advection
has persisted across southwest MN. A belt of 40-45 kt
southwesterlies has been consistently sampled by the FSD VWP from
1-3 km and this is expected to gradually shift east into this
evening. RAP-based forecast soundings and observed cloud bases
suggest initial cells are probably rooted around 750 mb along the
differential heating zone west of the MCV cloud shield. Nearly all
guidance has lacked robust convective signal this afternoon, except
for the 12Z HRW-NSSL. It has a low-probability scenario of a
supercell developing within this regime and tracking south-southeast
along the differential heating corridor. The more probable scenario
is for sporadic attempts at transient updraft rotation, capable of
producing marginally severe hail and locally strong gusts. These
threats should remain within a confined corridor at any one time,
but gradually translate east into early evening.

Mesoscale Discussion 1939
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0311 PM CDT Wed Aug 13 2025

Areas affected...portions of northeastern Wyoming into western South
Dakota

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 132011Z - 132145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...The severe threat is increasing across portions of the
northern Plains. Severe wind and hail are the main threats, with an
organized wind threat likely if storms merge into an MCS.

DISCUSSION...A multicellular cluster has developed across northern
WY, and is gradually intensifying (based on increasing lightning
trends) as a mid-level vort max traverses the northern Rockies. As
such, the ongoing convection should persist as it progresses into SD
over the next few hours. With the approach of the vort max,
deep-layer shear should continue to strengthen, with widespread 40
kts of effective bulk shear likely. At the same time, MLCINH will
continue to erode as surface temperatures climb into the 90s F amid
upper 50s F dewpoints in western SD, boosting MLCAPE to 1000 J/kg. 

The combination of this buoyancy and mainly elongated hodographs
will encourage continued multicellular development and perhaps
preceding supercells, accompanied by both a severe wind and hail
threat. With time though, upscale growth into an MCS is possible,
particularly in western SD. This MCS will then approach a more moist
low-level airmass while traversing a surface boundary, with surface
dewpoints well into the 60s F, which will encourage further
strengthening and associated potential for some wind swath
organization. As such, a Severe Thunderstorm Watch will eventually
be needed, with timing of watch issuance remaining the primary
question.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 588
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
245 PM MDT Wed Aug 13 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Northern Nebraska
  Western and Central South Dakota
  Northeast Wyoming

* Effective this Wednesday afternoon and evening from 245 PM
  until 1000 PM MDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm cluster moving out of northeast WY is
expected to continue southeastward over the next several hours. This
cluster has already produced several gusts around 60 mph. The risk
for strong to severe gusts should continue over the next several
hours as the cluster moves southeastward into the more moist and
unstable airmass downstream across western/central South Dakota and
northern Nebraska.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 65
statute miles north and south of a line from 85 miles west of Rapid
City SD to 55 miles north northeast of Oneill NE. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU8).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
1.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
27035.

Post-Tropical Cyclone Henriette Discussion Number  37
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   EP082025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 PM HST Tue Aug 12 2025
 
Henriette has failed to produce any deep convection near the 
low-level center for about 12 hours. Global models show that 
convection is not expected to return over the low-level center in an 
environment of strong vertical wind shear, dry mid-level air, and 
cooling SSTs along the forecast track. With convection not 
anticipated to return, Henriette is now designated as a 
post-tropical cyclone. A recent scatterometer Metop-B pass at 0717 
UTC showed winds around 35-39 kt, mainly in the eastern semi-circle. 
Using this data, and an assumed weakening trend from the previous 
advisory the intensity is set to 40 kt.
 
The cyclone is moving towards the northwest at 325/17 kt. This 
general motion should continue through Wednesday, with a turn to the 
north, then northeast around a large subtropical ridge as the system 
continues to weaken. The cyclone is forecast to open into a trough 
and dissipate by the end of the week.
 
This is the last advisory for this system. For additional
information on the post-tropical cyclone please see High Seas
Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, under AWIPS header
NFDHSFEPI, WMO header FZPN02 KWBC, and on the web at
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFEPI.php
