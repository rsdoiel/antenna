Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0343 PM CDT Thu Mar 21 2024

Valid 231200Z - 291200Z

Critical fire weather conditions are anticipated Sunday afternoon
across portions of the Southern High Plains, and may re-emerge later
in the upcoming work week. Elsewhere across the country, a
combination of precipitation chances, cool temperatures, and/or
unreceptive fuels will limit the potential for widespread fire
weather concerns. 

...D4/Sunday - Southern High Plains...
Confidence continues to increase regarding the fire weather
potential Sunday afternoon as an upper-level trough settles into the
Four Corners region. Medium to long-range guidance has maintained a
strong signal for a deepening lee cyclone over the CO/KS region
Sunday afternoon amid strengthening upper-level flow over the
central/southern Rockies. This will establish a swath of strong
southwesterly flow across eastern NM into western TX behind a
sharpening dryline. The eastern extent of the fire weather threat
will be conditional on the progression of the dryline by peak
heating, with some solutions hinting that this boundary may reach
into western/central OK and north/northwest TX by 21 UTC. 

Relative humidity values may not be quite as low as previous
critical fire weather events, but most deterministic/ensemble
solutions (including bias-corrected guidance) hint that RH minimums
near 20% should be fairly common. ERC values are currently near the
50th percentile, and light scattered rainfall is noted over western
TX as of 20 UTC Thursday. However, even with modest RH reductions
(by southern Plains standards) and marginal ERC values, an excessive
loading of fine, 1-hour fuels combined with high probability for
20-30 mph winds and ~20% RH should support a wind-driven fire
weather concern. Higher risk probabilities have been introduced from
far southeast NM into western TX to delineate where guidance
currently indicates the best overlap of the low-level thermal ridge
and the mid/upper-level jet maximum should occur. This region will
see the highest potential for sub-20% RH as well as gusts upwards of
40-60 mph. Further forecast refinements are anticipated as
confidence in finer-scale details improves. 

Heading into the upcoming work week, more regional fire weather
concerns may develop across southwest TX and the Rio Grande river
valley within a dry post-frontal regime. A more robust fire concern
is beginning to emerge around the D8/Thursday time frame when a
second upper trough could move into the region. Confidence in
surface details is too low at this range to introduce risk
probabilities, but trends will be monitored for this next system.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0232 PM CDT Thu Mar 21 2024

Valid 212000Z - 221200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS
OF NORTH...CENTRAL AND SOUTHEAST TEXAS INTO SOUTHWEST LOUISIANA...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated strong to severe thunderstorms may produce a few instances
of hail in the inch to inch-and-a-half range, and locally strong
gusts across parts of northern and central Texas this through this
evening. Additional strong storms overnight may produce locally
strong gusts and small hail across southeast Texas into southwest
Louisiana.

...20z Update...

The only changes with the 20z update were to adjust the 10 percent
general thunderstorm probabilities based on latest trends and short
term guidance. Severe probabilities are unchanged across TX into
southwest LA. Isolated strong to severe thunderstorms are expected
to develop through late afternoon and into this evening, posing a
risk for a few instances of large hail and strong gusts. For more
information on short term severe potential reference MCD 0267.

While one or more bowing clusters is expected to develop southeast
toward southeast TX/southwest LA, convection is expected to remain
elevated given a poor low-level thermodynamic environment and
increasing boundary-layer inhibition during the nighttime hours.
This should limit a greater damaging wind risk overnight.

..Leitman.. 03/21/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1126 AM CDT Thu Mar 21 2024/

...Northern and central Texas to southwestern Louisiana...
Widespread morning convection, and associated/expansive low cloud
cover, persists per recent radar and visible satellite imagery
across roughly the eastern half of Texas.  Farther to the
west/northwest, from the Big Country southward toward the Concho
Valley, and areas west, lack of cloud cover will permit diurnal
heating, which -- given 50s dewpoints -- will contribute to modest
(500 to 1000 J/kg) mixed-layer CAPE this afternoon.  

As ascent associated with the upper disturbance currently moving
across eastern New Mexico spreads into Texas, expect storms to
develop -- initially cellularly but then possibly growing upscale
into eastward-moving bands.  Small hail appears likely, but the
low-topped nature of the storms, the rather limited CAPE, and
somewhat marginal deep-layer shear suggests that more intense,
rotating updrafts may be somewhat difficult to be sustained. 
Therefore, coverage of severe-caliber hail (likely limited to the
inch to inch-and-a-half range) should remain isolated.  As such,
will maintain only MRGL/5% risk at this time.  A few stronger wind
gusts will also be possible, but likewise it appears that 5%
probability is appropriate per current expectations.

Storms will spread eastward across eastern Texas overnight, and
eventually into southwestern Louisiana, but will be moving into
areas where widespread convection will have occurred, which should
limit any more appreciable severe potential.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0746 AM CDT Thu Mar 21 2024

Valid 211300Z - 221200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS TODAY INTO EARLY
TONIGHT FOR SOUTHEAST TX...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms producing large hail and strong wind
gusts are possible from the northwest Gulf coast into central Texas.

...TX area through tonight...
Elevated thunderstorm development is underway this morning over the
middle TX coastal plain, near and just north of a coastal front. 
Per the 12z CRP/BRO soundings, the environment is sufficient for a
couple of slightly elevated supercells capable of producing isolated
1-2 inch diameter hail and gusts up to 60 mph.  The storms are
expected to gradually grow upscale in the warm advection regime
through the morning, with the likelihood that a cluster/MCS will
evolve and move offshore toward midday/early afternoon.

Farther west, a midlevel shortwave trough over west TX/NM will
progress eastward to central TX this evening, accompanied by a weak
surface reflection.  Surface heating in cloud breaks and
boundary-layer dewpoints in the 55-60 F range will boost MLCAPE into
the 500-1000 J/kg range across central into northwest TX.  The
destabilization and weakening convective inhibition, in combination
with the zone of ascent preceding the midlevel trough, will support
scattered thunderstorm development by mid afternoon (~20-21z). 
Steepening low-midlevel lapse rates and modestly long/relatively
straight hodographs (effective bulk shear 25-35 kt) will favor a mix
of clusters and some supercell structures capable of producing
isolated large hail (1-1.5 inches) and outflow gusts of 50-60 mph. 
The convection will subsequently spread east-southeastward across
central TX this evening and into southeast TX and possibly far
southwest LA tonight.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 57
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
625 AM CDT Thu Mar 21 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Middle Texas Coastal Plain
  Coastal Waters

* Effective this Thursday morning and afternoon from 625 AM until
  100 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2
    inches in diameter possible
  Isolated damaging wind gusts to 60 mph possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms will increase in coverage/intensity this
morning while spreading east and northeastward near the middle Texas
Coast.  A couple of slightly elevated supercells will be possible,
with the potential to produce 1-2 inch diameter hail and isolated
damaging gusts near 60 mph.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 50
statute miles east and west of a line from 50 miles south of
Victoria TX to 45 miles northwest of Angleton TX. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU7).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 50 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
26020.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0135 AM CDT Thu Mar 21 2024

Valid 221200Z - 231200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Elevated fire-weather conditions are possible on Friday afternoon
across portions of West TX. Elsewhere, a progressive weather pattern
and associated widespread precipitation -- along with a trailing
cold front and milder conditions -- will temper any fire-weather
threat.

...West TX...
In the wake of an ejecting, mid-level trough, modest
west-northwesterly flow is forecast over eastern NM and West TX.
This will lead to dry, downsloping flow and deepening, well-mixed
boundary layers across West TX. Critical-level relative humidities
(10-15 percent) are possible across the region by mid-afternoon.
Given a lack of more robust cyclone development, surface wind speeds
are expected to be more tempered around 10-15 mph. Parts of the
region also recently experienced some wetting precipitation, but
this was relatively limited (around 0.1 inches) and localized in
nature. Given forecast ERCs in the 70-80th percentiles and generally
persistent dry and windy conditions, Elevated fire-weather
conditions appear possible in the delineated area Friday afternoon.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS
OF THE FLORIDA PENINSULA...

...SUMMARY...
Strong thunderstorms may move inland off the Gulf of Mexico into
portions of the northern and central Florida peninsula early Monday.
Additional thunderstorms may develop during the afternoon along the
east-central and southeast Florida coast. Strong gusts and hail may
accompany this activity.

...FL Peninsula...

An upper trough over the Great Lakes and MS Valley will pivot
east/southeast across the eastern U.S. on Monday. Forecast guidance
depicts a shortwave perturbation in the base of the trough over the
northern Gulf of Mexico shifting east across northern/north-central
FL Monday morning. Deep-layer westerly flow will increase with
southward extent across the FL Panhandle through the afternoon, with
30-40 kt 850-700 mb flow common ahead of southward-sagging surface
boundary. 

Showers and thunderstorms may be ongoing across parts of
north-central FL Monday morning. Gusty winds may accompany this
activity as it spreads east the first few hours of the forecast
period. A more conditional severe thunderstorm risk may develop
during the afternoon further south across parts of the
east-central/southeast coast. 

The NAM appears to be an outlier with the strength of an EML,
maintaining capping through the period. The RAP/HRRR/GFS show weaker
capping around 700 mb with full erosion of the cap by afternoon.
Given favorable vertical shear (0-6 effective shear around 40 kt),
steep midlevel lapse rates (around 7-7.5 C/km) and MLCAPE around
1500-2000 J/kg, at least a conditional risk for a couple of severe
storms appears plausible. Large-scale ascent will remain weak over
the area, and veered low-level flow will limit low-level convergence
along the southward-developing surface front. If a well-defined sea
breeze develops along the southeast Peninsula, this could allow for
a few storms to develop during the afternoon/early evening, posing a
conditional risk for large hail and strong gusts. For this reason,
have expanded the Marginal risk (level 1 of 5) to encompass the
southeast Peninsula.

During the day on Sunday, mid-level pattern will be characterized by
a digging longwave trough over the central and eastern US with a
cutoff low in the southwest US. This will promote cool, northerly

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM THE MOUTH
OF THE MISSISSIPPI TO THE FLORIDA BIG BEND...

...SUMMARY...
Local/isolated risk for gusty/damaging winds remains possible today
from southeastern Louisiana to the Florida Panhandle/Big Bend area.

...Gulf Coastal area from southeastern Louisiana to the Florida Big
Bend...
A well-defined MCS with embedded MCV is moving eastward across the
southeastern Louisiana vicinity late this morning, along the
west-to-east synoptic cold front lying roughly across the Gulf Coast
region.  

West of this convective complex, weak quasi-geostrophic ascent
across Texas -- within a zone of modest low-level warm advection
beneath minor mid-level disturbances moving through fast
west-southwesterly flow aloft southeast of the Desert Southwest
upper low -- will support occasional deep convection.  However,
aside from a couple of sporadic stronger storms and possibly
brief/marginally severe hail/wind risk locally, risk appears too low
to require inclusion of probabilities in the current outlook.

East of the MCS, limited severe risk remains apparent across coastal
areas, though the strongest storms should remain over the northern
Gulf.  Still, gusty/locally damaging winds may occur, warranting
