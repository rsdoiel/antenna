URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 552
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
345 PM CDT Mon Jul 28 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Extreme west central Minnesota
  Northern Nebraska
  Central and eastern South Dakota

* Effective this Monday afternoon and evening from 345 PM until
  1000 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Widespread damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 90
    mph likely
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2.5
    inches in diameter likely
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Initial severe storm development is underway across south
central South Dakota, where supercells with isolated very large hail
up to 2.5 inches in diameter will be possible, as well as an
isolated tornado or two with storms near the front closer to Huron. 
Eventual upscale growth into one or more clusters is expected, with
an increasing threat for swaths of damaging winds (potentially up to
80-90 mph) with any bowing segments.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 75
statute miles north and south of a line from 50 miles north
northwest of Valentine NE to 20 miles southeast of Brookings SD. For
a complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU2).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 551...

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 80 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 650. Mean storm motion vector
26030.

Mesoscale Discussion 1824
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0247 PM CDT Mon Jul 28 2025

Areas affected...parts of south central and southeastern South
Dakota...adjacent north central Nebraska

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 281947Z - 282145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered, intensifying thunderstorm development, posing a
risk for a few strong downbursts and perhaps some hail, appears
possible by 4-6 PM CDT.  Timing of a potential severe weather watch
issuance remains unclear, but trends are being monitored for this
possibility.

DISCUSSION...A surface cold front, now advancing south of Pierre,
Philip and Rapid City is becoming better defined, with strengthening
differential heating along and ahead of it, centered near the
western South Dakota/Nebraska state border northeastward across the
Winner toward Huron vicinities.  While temperatures are approaching
100 F within the corridor of stronger boundary-layer heating,
surface dew points have been slower to mix below 70F, and through
the 60s F, than suggested by model forecast soundings at Winner and
Valentine.  Even so, latest objective analysis suggests that the
pre- and post-cold frontal boundary layer remains strongly capped
beneath the warm and elevated mixed-layer air as far north as the
North/South Dakota state border vicinity.

Mid/upper support for sustained boundary-layer based convection
anytime soon remains unclear, although it appears possible that a
subtle perturbation progressing across and east-northeast of the
Black Hills is contributing to ongoing attempts at convective
development.  It appears more probable that with further insolation,
continued heating and deeper mixing within the pre-frontal
boundary-layer may eventually support intensifying, high-based
thunderstorm development late this afternoon.  In the presence of
strong deep-layer shear, this activity could pose a risk for severe
hail and increasing potential for strong downbursts into early
evening.

Hurricane Iona Discussion Number   7
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 AM HST Mon Jul 28 2025
 
After rapidly strengthening overnight, the cloud pattern and
overall structure of Iona has changed little during the past 6
hours.  A fairly symmetric Central Dense Overcast is seen over the
center in geostationary satellite imagery, but there has been no
recent microwave data to examine the inner core structure. The
latest subjective satellite intensity estimates are T4.0/65 kt
from SAB, and T3.5/55 kt from both PHFO and JTWC.  Objective
estimates remain lower, although it is possible that the small size 
of the cyclone is making it difficult for those techniques to 
capture the true intensity.  The initial intensity for this advisory 
will remain 65 kt, in line with the higher subjective estimate from 
SAB.
 
Iona is located within a low-shear environment and over sea surface
temperatures of around 28C.  Those conditions favor strengthening,
however some nearby dry mid-level air may have been entrained in 
the circulation which likely caused the recent pause in
intensification.  Given the favorable upper-air pattern and warm 
sea surface temperatures, additional strengthening appears likely.  
The regional hurricane models are more aggressive this cycle and 
indicate that Iona could be near or at major hurricane strength in 
a day or so.  As a result, the lastest official forecast calls 
for rapid strengthening during the next 24 hours and the peak 
intensity is raised slightly from the previous advisory.  Around 
midweek, slightly lower SSTs and an increase in vertical
wind shear are expected to cause gradual weakening through the
remainder of the forecast period.  The updated NHC intensity 
forecast is close to the regional models through 24 hours, and then 
follows the latest multi-model (IVCN) consensus aid after that time.
 
Iona is moving westward or 270 degrees at 9 kt.  The storm is
forecast to move along the southern portion of a subtropical ridge
that is well established over the central Pacific.  This steering
pattern should take the storm westward during the next day or so,
followed by a faster west-northwestward motion after midweek. The
updated track forecast is once again near the center of the model
envelope, close to the various consensus aids.  Confidence remains
high that Iona will stay well south of the Hawaiian Islands.

Tropical Storm Keli Discussion Number   2
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP022025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 AM HST Mon Jul 28 2025

ASCAT data from around 1830 Z showed a small area of 
tropical-storm-force winds just north of the center of the system.  
Based on that data, the depression has been upgraded to Tropical 
storm Keli with maximum winds of about 35 kt. Although the winds 
are estimated to be higher than earlier this morning, satellite 
images indicate that the deep convection has generally decreased 
during the past few hours. Keli is a very compact storm with its 
associated cloud field extending only about 90 n mi across. 
 
The storm is moving westward at about 9 kt. Keli is expected to 
continue westward, following Iona, during the next few days as it 
remains on the south side of a narrow mid-level ridge. The latest 
track models have trended a little to the north and are faster this 
cycle, and the official forecast has been nudged in those 
directions.
 
The environmental conditions could favor a little more strengthening 
during the next day or so while the storm is over relatively warm 
water, embedded in a moist air mass, and in generally moderate 
shear conditions. By the middle of the week, however, Iona's outflow 
will likely impinge on the cyclone. These unfavorable upper-level 
winds and stable air should end the opportunity for strengthening 
and cause weakening. Most of the models show Keli dissipating in 
about 2 days, except for the GFS which hangs on to the cyclone for 
about 3 days. Based on the latest guidance, the official forecast 
has moved up dissipation by 24 hours.

Valid 282000Z - 291200Z

...THERE IS A MODERATE RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON
INTO TONIGHT FROM EASTERN SOUTH DAKOTA ACROSS SOUTHERN MINNESOTA AND
NORTHERN IOWA...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS OF
CENTRAL MONTANA...

...SUMMARY...
Severe storm clusters are expected to form this afternoon in South
Dakota and then spread southeastward into Minnesota and Iowa through
tonight.  Swaths of damaging winds, potentially 75-90 mph, a few
tornadoes and isolated large hail will all be possible.

...20Z Update...
The primary change with this update was removing the Slight risk
area across parts of the northern High Plains -- where the severe
risk has decreased behind an earlier cluster of storms. Elsewhere,
the previous forecast thinking remains the same. Thunderstorms are
evolving across the higher terrain in western MT, and will track
eastward into an increasingly moist/unstable air mass this
afternoon. Reference Severe Thunderstorm Watch 551 and MCD 1823 for
details. 

Farther east, thunderstorms are developing along a baroclinic zone
extending across SD. These storms will pose a risk of severe
downbursts as they develop into a hot/deeply mixed air mass in
south-central SD and north-central NE this afternoon (see MCD 1824).
This activity, and potentially new development along the baroclinic
zone, should eventually spread eastward into eastern SD -- where
intensification into one or more organized/intense clusters is still
expected into tonight.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1130 AM CDT Mon Jul 28 2025/

...Dakotas to MN/IA through tonight...
Around the northern periphery of a midlevel high covering the
southern Plains and Southeast, a series of embedded speed maxima
will progress from MT across the Dakotas to MN through early
Tuesday.  Elevated convection is ongoing in association with two
such speed maxima - one over ND and another moving eastward over
eastern MT.  At the surface, a lee cyclone is present near the SD/NE
border, and a baroclinic zone arcs into northeast SD and then
southeastward across southwest MN into northern IA.  A prior outflow
boundary (from dissipated overnight convection) will become more
diffuse with time as a result of strong surface heating across
IA/NE/SD within the old cold pool.

The elevated convection across southern ND, and moving from MT into
southwest ND, could persist in the post-frontal environment with
weak warm advection atop the frontal surface.  Steep midlevel lapse
rates and 40-50 kt midlevel flow suggests a continued threat for
occasional severe outflow gusts and isolated large hail.  The more
substantial severe-storm threat is expected to evolve farther
southeast by mid-late afternoon along the baroclinic zone in SD, to
the northeast of the lee cyclone.  Strong surface heating, continued
moisture advection and evapotranspiration will lead to the
development of strong-extreme buoyancy (3000-4500+ J/kg MLCAPE)
beneath an elevated mixed layer with 8.5-9 C/km midlevel lapse
rates.  Storms that form in SD are then expected to congeal into a
cluster or two that will subsequently spread east-southeastward
along the more northwest-southeast oriented baroclinic zone now
noted in visible imagery and surface observations from southwest MN
into northern IA.  The thermodynamic environment will favor both
intense updrafts and downdrafts, while deep-layer vertical shear
will be sufficient for an organized/bowing MCS.  Thus, there will be
the potential for swaths of significant-severe outflow (75-90 mph),
as well as isolated large hail and a few tornadoes (either with
initially discrete supercells or with embedded circulations with
bowing segments).

...Central MT this afternoon through early tonight...
An embedded speed max will crest the ridge and move from ID to
southwest MT this afternoon/evening.  Residual boundary-layer
dewpoints in the mid-upper 50s in the post-frontal environment,
along with surface heating and the north edge of the steeper
midlevel lapse rates will favor scattered thunderstorm development
by early-mid afternoon (near and just northeast of the higher
terrain southwest into central MT).  MLCAPE of 1500-2000 J/kg,
effective bulk shear in excess of 40 kt and seasonably cool midlevel
temperatures suggest the potential for initial supercells with large
hail (1-2.5 inches in diameter), and also the potential for upscale
growth into a cluster with the attendant threat for wind damage.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0250 PM CDT Mon Jul 28 2025

Valid 291200Z - 301200Z

...20z update...
The previous outlooks remains valid with only minor adjustments for
the latest model guidance. Widely scattered showers and
thunderstorms, with isolated dry strikes, are likely over much of
the Northwest Tuesday. While several rounds of storms have resulted
in some precipitation accumulation and wetting of fuels, widely
scattered storms with limited precipitation efficiency will still
pose a risk for ignitions over parts of the southern Cascades and
northern CA. A few storms may continue overnight into early
D3/Wednesday with isolated lightning possible.

..Lyons.. 07/28/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0153 AM CDT Mon Jul 28 2025/

...Synopsis...
Similar to Day 1, an upper ridge will remain in place over the
CONUS, with mid-level moisture continuing to pivot around the ridge
across the Pacific Northwest into the Northern Rockies. A dry
boundary layer will develop during the afternoon and support a mix
of wet and dry thunderstorms. As in Day 1, isolated dry thunderstorm
highlights have been introduced given the presence of dry fuels.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0226 PM CDT Mon Jul 28 2025

Valid 301200Z - 311200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
NORTHERN/CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS...ACROSS THE MID-MISSISSIPPI
VALLEY...AND OVER PORTIONS OF THE NORTHEAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are possible in the Mid-Missouri/Mississippi
Valley vicinity, parts of the Mid-Atlantic/southern New England, and
the northern/central High Plains on Wednesday.

...Synopsis...

A belt of enhanced mid/upper westerly flow on the southern periphery
of the eastern Canada upper cyclone will overlap portions of the
Great Lakes to the Northeast. A surface cold front is forecast to
move south/southeast across portions of OK/TX into the Ohio Valley
and Northeast on Wednesday. Ahead of the front, a seasonally moist
airmass will be in place. The corridor of greatest instability will
reside from the Ozarks to the Ohio Valley and into the northern
Mid-Atlantic, coincident with stronger boundary layer moisture and
stronger heating. The better boundary layer moisture/instability
corridor will remain displaced to the south of the stronger
mid/upper flow. Nevertheless, a few corridors of strong to severe
thunderstorm potential appear possible.

...Lower-MO/Mid-MS Valley vicinity...

A decaying MCS from the Day 2/Tuesday period may be located over IA.
Associated outflow and any MCV could move across parts of the Mid-MS
Valley and become a focus for more organized storm development
within the modestly sheared environment. This scenario is uncertain
and depends on how convection develops late in the Day 2 period into
early Day 3/Wednesday. Any storms that develop will do so within a
very moist (70s dewpoints) and strongly unstable airmass. A risk for
damaging/severe gusts would accompany this activity.

...Northeast...

A moist boundary layer will be in place ahead of the south/southeast
moving cold front. Midlevel lapse rates will be weak, limiting
stronger destabilization. The corridor of greatest instability will
likely remain confined to the northern Mid-Atlantic vicinity with
more modest moisture/instability with northward extent into ME.
Nevertheless, stronger vertical shear will reside across the region.
Vertically veering wind profiles and effective shear values greater
than 40 kt suggest supercells may be possible, though shear profiles
are forecast to remain weak through 1-2 km. Where strong heating
occurs and allows for steep low-level lapse rates, strong/locally
damaging gusts may occur.

...Northern/Central High Plains...

Easterly low-level flow will maintain modest boundary layer moisture
(mid 50s to low 60s dewpoints) across the region beneath steep
midlevel lapse rates.  This will support development of moderate
instability during the afternoon within the upslope flow regime.
Initial thunderstorms will develop over higher terrain and generally
migrate east. While low-level flow through around 2-3 km will remain
very weak, vertically veering wind profiles and rapidly increasing
westerlies above 500 mb will support effective shear magnitudes
around 25-35 kt, allowing for some storm organization. Isolated hail
and gusty winds will be possible with these storms. 

...Oregon...

A weak upper shortwave trough is forecast to move across OR during
the afternoon or evening. Sufficient midlevel moisture will be
present amid steep midlevel lapse rates to support isolated
thunderstorm development associated with this feature. MLCAPE values
to around 500-1000 J/kg over a relatively confined area near the
Cascades will be possible. Low to midlevel flow will remain weak,
with increasing winds above 3 km, resulting in sufficient effective
shear magnitudes for a couple of briefly organized cells. Inverted-v
sub-cloud thermodynamic profiles could support sporadic strong
gusts. A Marginal risk (level 1 of 5) could be needed at some point
in the coming day if confidence increases in storm timing and
coverage.

1224 PM CDT Mon Jul 28 2025

Valid 291200Z - 301200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM THE NORTHERN
HIGH PLAINS INTO THE MID-MISSOURI VALLEY...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are possible from southern Montana into the
central High Plains as well as parts of the Mid-Missouri and
Mid-Mississippi Valleys on Tuesday.

...Synopsis...

A belt of enhanced northwesterly flow aloft will extend from
portions of the Dakotas into the Great Lakes on Tuesday. A somewhat
complex surface pattern is forecast. A low will likely be located
over the southwest NE/northwest KS/northeast CO vicinity. A front
will extend from the low northeast into central MN/northern WI
Tuesday morning. Outflow from a severe MCS in the Day 1/Monday
period may be located across portions of the Mid-MS Valley, but this
is uncertain. A very moist and unstable airmass will reside to the
east of the low and in the vicinity of these surface boundaries,
with the corridor of greatest instability expected to extend from
northeast CO eastward across NE and into IA/northern MO/northeast
KS. 

Behind the surface front across portions of WY/MT into the Dakotas,
boundary layer moisture will be maintained with dewpoints in the mid
50s to low 60s. This will support weak to moderate instability by
afternoon.

...Northeast CO into NE and the Mid-MO Valley/central IA...

This region will be displaced to the south from the belt of stronger
mid/upper northwesterly flow. Nevertheless, strong instability and
low-level convergence will support thunderstorm development during
the afternoon near the surface low and northeastward along the
surface front. Vertically veering wind profiles will support
effective shear magnitudes in the 25-40 kt range, with initial
supercells possible. With time, clustering is expected. One or more
line segments or possibly a severe MCS could develop and move east
across central/eastern NE into western/central IA and vicinity.
Severe/damaging wind gusts will be the main hazard, but isolated
hail may also occur, especially early in thunderstorm evolution.

...MT/WY into western SD/NE Panhandle...

Scattered thunderstorms will develop during the afternoon in the
moist post-frontal upslope regime. These areas will experience
better shear, with stronger mid/upper westerly flow compared to
points further southeast. Forecast soundings across eastern WY
indicated effective shear magnitudes greater than 40 kt will be
possible, with elongated/straight hodographs also noted. Steep
midlevel lapse rates large instability through the cold layer aloft,
in combination with favorable shear profiles, suggests cells
producing isolated large hail will be possible, particularly from
eastern WY into adjacent parts of MT/SD/NE. Further northwest into
southern MT, instability will be lower and storm coverage more
isolated. Still any storms that do develop will pose a risk for
marginal hail. Where stronger heating occurs across the region,
steepening low-level lapse rates could also support strong to severe
wind gusts.

..ND...

Isolated thunderstorms are expected to develop as a shortwave
impulse migrates through west/northwesterly flow aloft. Buoyancy
will be fairly weak this far north with only modest boundary-layer
moisture persisting behind the surface front and generally warm
temperatures aloft through about 600 mb. Nevertheless, strong
mid/upper flow will support organized cells. Elongated/straight
hodographs and effective shear greater than 40 kt suggests isolated
marginal hail will be possible with any storms that develop.

1151 AM CDT Mon Jul 28 2025

Valid 281700Z - 291200Z

...17z Update...
A mix of wet/dry thunderstorms with dry lightning potential remains
likely this afternoon and evening from northern CA into southern OR
and western ID. CAM guidance has trended stronger with isolated
convection over the mountains of northern CA. With deep inverted-v
profiles, a few dry strikes are possible. IsoDryT highlights have
been expanded southward. See the previous discussion for more info.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0152 AM CDT Mon Jul 28 2025/

...Synopsis...
An upper ridge will dominate the CONUS today, with mid-level
moisture poised to pivot around the upper ridge through the period.
By afternoon, a deep, dry boundary layer (potentially extending to
500 mb) will develop in advance of thunderstorm initiation. Forecast
soundings show inverted-v profiles, suggesting that at least a mix
of wet and dry thunderstorms will develop across portions of the
Pacific Northwest into the Northern Rockies. Given dry fuels over
the region, isolated dry thunderstorm highlights were introduced
given the possibility of lightning-induced ignitions.

...THERE IS A MODERATE RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON
INTO TONIGHT FROM EASTERN SOUTH DAKOTA ACROSS SOUTHERN MINNESOTA AND
NORTHERN IOWA...

...SUMMARY...
Severe storm clusters are expected to form this afternoon in South
Dakota and then spread southeastward into Minnesota and Iowa through
tonight.  Swaths of damaging winds, potentially 75-90 mph, a few
tornadoes and isolated large hail will all be possible.

...Dakotas to MN/IA through tonight...
Around the northern periphery of a midlevel high covering the
southern Plains and Southeast, a series of embedded speed maxima
will progress from MT across the Dakotas to MN through early
Tuesday.  Elevated convection is ongoing in association with two
such speed maxima - one over ND and another moving eastward over
eastern MT.  At the surface, a lee cyclone is present near the SD/NE
border, and a baroclinic zone arcs into northeast SD and then
southeastward across southwest MN into northern IA.  A prior outflow
boundary (from dissipated overnight convection) will become more
diffuse with time as a result of strong surface heating across
IA/NE/SD within the old cold pool.

The elevated convection across southern ND, and moving from MT into
southwest ND, could persist in the post-frontal environment with
weak warm advection atop the frontal surface.  Steep midlevel lapse
rates and 40-50 kt midlevel flow suggests a continued threat for
occasional severe outflow gusts and isolated large hail.  The more
substantial severe-storm threat is expected to evolve farther
southeast by mid-late afternoon along the baroclinic zone in SD, to
the northeast of the lee cyclone.  Strong surface heating, continued
moisture advection and evapotranspiration will lead to the
development of strong-extreme buoyancy (3000-4500+ J/kg MLCAPE)
beneath an elevated mixed layer with 8.5-9 C/km midlevel lapse
rates.  Storms that form in SD are then expected to congeal into a
cluster or two that will subsequently spread east-southeastward
along the more northwest-southeast oriented baroclinic zone now
noted in visible imagery and surface observations from southwest MN
into northern IA.  The thermodynamic environment will favor both
intense updrafts and downdrafts, while deep-layer vertical shear
will be sufficient for an organized/bowing MCS.  Thus, there will be
the potential for swaths of significant-severe outflow (75-90 mph),
as well as isolated large hail and a few tornadoes (either with
initially discrete supercells or with embedded circulations with
bowing segments).

...Central MT this afternoon through early tonight...
An embedded speed max will crest the ridge and move from ID to
southwest MT this afternoon/evening.  Residual boundary-layer
dewpoints in the mid-upper 50s in the post-frontal environment,
along with surface heating and the north edge of the steeper
midlevel lapse rates will favor scattered thunderstorm development
by early-mid afternoon (near and just northeast of the higher
terrain southwest into central MT).  MLCAPE of 1500-2000 J/kg,
effective bulk shear in excess of 40 kt and seasonably cool midlevel
temperatures suggest the potential for initial supercells with large
hail (1-2.5 inches in diameter), and also the potential for upscale
growth into a cluster with the attendant threat for wind damage.

Areas affected...parts of western/central ND

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 281221Z - 281415Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...A persistent supercell or two may yield a confined swath
of large hail and strong gusts into late morning. Monitoring for
possible Severe Thunderstorm Watch issuance.

DISCUSSION...A couple elevated supercells are ongoing across
southwest/west-central ND, along and just north of I-94. Despite a
lack of reported severe thus far, strong westerly speed shear above
3 km (now sampled by the BIS VWP and 12Z observed sounding) has
sustained persistent organizational structures as these cells spread
across the MT/ND border. This elevated activity is likely to persist
into midday along the buoyancy gradient across western ND. Large
hail and strong gusts should be the primary hazards. Severe wind may
increase if flanking convection can form along the outflow into a
destabilizing airmass over SD. But ongoing low clouds/fog in the
swath of richest low-level moisture casts uncertainty on whether
that scenario may occur soon or later today.

...THERE IS A MODERATE RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON
AND TONIGHT OVER PORTIONS OF EASTERN SOUTH DAKOTA AND SOUTHWESTERN
MINNESOTA....

...SUMMARY...
Numerous severe thunderstorms capable of widespread damaging winds
are likely across portions of the northern Plains, with several
gusts expected to exceed 75 mph. A few line-embedded tornadoes and
instances of severe hail may also occur. Widely scattered storms may
produce severe wind and hail over portions of Montana.

...Northern Plains...
A convectively active afternoon and evening is expected across parts
of the Dakotas/MN/IA/WI, where numerous intense thunderstorms are
expected.  An overnight MCS has temporarily stabilized/modified the
air mass across much of MN/IA.  A consensus of model guidance
appears to have handled this scenario well, and depicts rapid return
of low-level moisture and heating across this region by
mid-afternoon.  Meanwhile upstream in eastern MT and western ND/SD,
a subtle shortwave trough will top the ridge and spread large scale
forcing into the region, leading to scattered thunderstorm
development.  Very steep mid-level lapse rates are in place across
ND/SD, where easterly low-level winds and evapo-transpiration will
help surface dewpoints to rise to near 70F.  Forecast soundings show
extreme instability will develop (MLCAPE values over 6000 J/kg)
aiding in rapid intensification of supercells across central SD. 
Large hail, damaging winds, and a few tornadoes may occur with this
early activity.  

The most likely scenario for evening convective activity continues
to be for an organized and fast-moving linear MCS to develop and
race eastward across eastern SD into parts of MN/IA.  One or more
corridors of widespread/significant wind damage are expected,
possibly achieving derecho criteria.  Have extended the ENH/SLGT
risk areas a little farther east into parts of MN/IA/WI, where a few
overnight CAM solutions suggest the bowing complex persists before
weakening late tonight.

...Central MT...
Easterly low-level winds across MT will advect moisture westward
into the mountains, where scattered thunderstorm development is
expected by late afternoon.  These storms will spread into central
MT during the evening, with sufficient CAPE and vertical shear for a
risk of large hail and damaging wind gusts.

0349 AM CDT Mon Jul 28 2025

Valid 311200Z - 051200Z

...DISCUSSION...
By late next week, the upper-level trough in the Northeast will be
moving into the Canadian Maritimes. In its wake, high pressure at
the surface will build into the Upper Midwest/Ohio Valley. This will
push the surface front farther south each day through the weekend.
In the West, cyclonic flow will tend to weaken over time. The
surface front will be pushed up against the Rockies. Model guidance
shows progressively lower amounts of buoyancy south of the front in
the Southeast, likely due to repeated days of convection. This
activity will also become farther removed from stronger shear. Winds
with some upslope component with weak/modest westerlies aloft could
allow for some severe risk near the Rockies and adjacent High
Plains, but the overall weak shear and potential for sequential
convective days leading to a poor quality airmass suggest the threat
is like to remain marginal. Predictability of organized severe
weather remains low.

Tropical Storm Iona Discussion Number   5
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 PM HST Sun Jul 27 2025
 
The satellite presentation of Iona has improved this evening, with a
well-defined curved banding structure and excellent upper-level
outflow evident in all quadrants. A recent 28/0650Z Metop-C ASCAT
pass showed a few wind barbs near 40 knots. The latest subjective
Dvorak current intensity estimates came in at 3.0/45 knots from
PHFO, 3.0/45 knots from SAB, and 2.5/35 knots from JTWC. Objective
intensity estimates ranged from 42 to 49 knots. Taking a blend of
these data, the initial intensity for this advisory has been raised
to 45 knots, which may still be slightly conservative.
 
Tropical Storm Iona is moving westward at 270 degrees/10 knots. This
general motion is expected to continue over the next several days as
the cyclone moves along the southern periphery of a subtropical
ridge to the north. A gradual increase in forward speed is also
expected, due to a strengthening low- to mid-level ridge north of
the system. The track forecast remains closely aligned with a blend
of the FSSE, HCCA, and GFEX consensus guidance and is nearly
unchanged from the previous advisory. Confidence remains high that
Iona will stay well south of the Hawaiian Islands.
 
The environment appears conducive for further intensification over
the next day or so, as Iona remains over warm waters near 28C, with
adequate mid-level moisture and very light vertical wind shear. In
fact, the latest GFS and ECMWF SHIPS guidance indicates more than a
30 percent chance of a 25-knot increase in intensity over the next
24 hours. Given the current structure and favorable conditions, the
intensity forecast explicitly calls for rapid intensification during
the next 24 hours, with Iona expected to become a hurricane late
Monday or Monday night. Iona should reach peak intensity Monday
night or Tuesday, with steady weakening anticipated beginning
Tuesday night, as the system moves over slightly cooler waters,
begins to experience increasing westerly vertical wind shear, and
starts to entrain drier mid-level air. The cyclone is expected to
become a post-tropical remnant low by Day 5 and could potentially
weaken into a trough by that time. The intensity forecast has been
raised from the previous advisory to reflect the latest trends in
the guidance, and is best aligned with the FSSE and IVCN consensus
solutions.

Tropical Depression One-C Discussion Number   3
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 AM HST Sun Jul 27 2025
 
The system continues to become better organized this morning, with 
deep convection in curved banding generally to the west of the 
center. Recent imagery shows that convection has been developing the 
last few hours near the low-level center, with some increased 
curvature. Subjective Dvorak satellite intensity estimates from HFO 
and SAB were T/2.0 this cycle. A scatterometer pass is expected 
shortly which should give a better idea of the surface winds. Using 
the Dvorak estimates, the intensity is held at 30 kt.
 
The system is moving westward at about 270/10 kt. A westward motion 
is expected the next several days as the cyclone moves on the south 
side of a mid-level ridge. There continues to be some spread in the 
along track guidance, although there is high confidence on the 
system remaining well south of the Hawaiian islands. The NHC track 
forecast is similar to the previous, and lies closest to the HCCA 
corrected consensus aids.
 
Environmental conditions appear favorable for some gradual 
strengthening the next couple of days. The hurricane regional models 
remain at the higher end of the guidance envelope, and the latest 
NHC forecast is near the previous. Beyond 48 h, a gradual weakening 
trend should begin as the system moves over slightly cooler sea 
surface temperatures, a drier airmass, and vertical wind shear is 
expected to increase. The gradual weakening trend will cause the 
system to become a remnant low by day 5, potentially even opening 
into a trough.

Mesoscale Discussion 1811
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0257 PM CDT Sun Jul 27 2025

Areas affected...central/eastern North Carolina...southern Virginia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 271957Z - 272200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered thunderstorm activity will promote a few
instances of strong to severe wind this afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Scattered thunderstorm activity has increased in
coverage across portions of eastern North Carolina this afternoon.
The air mass in this region is very hot and unstable, but deep layer
shear for a more organized severe threat remains weak. Given the
deep moisture and strong instability, a few wet downbursts may
produce some instances of strong to severe wind. Overall, this
threat will remain too isolated for watch issuance.

Tropical Depression One-C Discussion Number   1
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 PM HST Sat Jul 26 2025

Deep convection has persisted over the area of low pressure well 
southeast of the Hawaiian Islands for the last 12 hours or so, with 
the latest satellite images showing improved organization and a 
better defined banding structure.  The latest subjective Dvorak 
current intensity estimates came in at 2.0/30 knots from PHFO, 
1.5/25 knots from SAB, and 1.0/25 knots from JTWC.  A recent 
27/0620Z Metop-B ASCAT pass showed a well-defined low-level 
circulation with a large swath of 25-knot winds and a few embedded 
25- to 30-knot wind barbs.  Given the improved structure and 
organization of the system, advisories are being initiated on the 
first tropical cyclone of the season in the central Pacific, 
Tropical Depression One-C.  The initial intensity will be set at 30 
knots.

Tropical Depression One-C is moving toward the west, or 270 degrees, 
at 10 knots.  This general westward motion is expected to continue 
over the next couple of days as the system moves along the southern 
periphery of a subtropical ridge to the north.  Beyond 48 hours, the 
forward speed is expected to increase considerably in response to a 
low- to mid-level ridge strengthening to the north of cyclone.  The 
track forecast closely follows a blend of the TVCE and HCCA 
consensus guidance.

The environment will remain conducive for intensification over the 
next couple of days, as One-C remains over warm waters between 28 
and 29C, with adequate mid-level moisture and light to moderate 
easterly shear.  As a result, the intensity forecast calls for 
steady strengthening during this time, with One-C becoming Tropical 
Storm Iona on Sunday.  Beyond 60 hours, the cyclone will begin to 
experience increasing westerly vertical wind shear while also 
entraining drier mid-level air.  This is expected to lead to steady 
weakening, with the system becoming a tropical depression again 
around day 5.  The intensity forecast is best aligned with the HCCA 
intensity consensus guidance.
