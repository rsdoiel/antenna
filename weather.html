Mesoscale Discussion 0176
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0856 AM CST Wed Feb 28 2024

Areas affected...TN Valley to southern Appalachians

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 281456Z - 281700Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Southern portion of a low-topped squall line should
continue eastward across parts of the Tennessee Valley through at
least midday. Strong to localized severe wind gusts capable of
sporadic damage should be the primary threat.

DISCUSSION...The southern portion of a long, but thin, low-topped
(echo tops to around 30k ft) squall line extends as far south as
northeast MS. Large-scale ascent, outside of low-level convergence
attendant to the southeast-moving cold front, will be gradually
weakening across the region into the afternoon. However, a few cloud
breaks noted ahead of the line should yield modest boundary-layer
destabilization. In conjunction with the northeast extent of low 60s
surface dew points, the relatively more favorable thermodynamic
environment should compensate for the diminishing ascent and will
probably sustain the low-topped convective line eastward through at
least midday. This scenario is generally supported by 12Z CAM
guidance. With veered surface and low-level flow, increasing to
40-45 kts at 1 km AGL, the primary threat should be strong to
locally severe surface gusts, peaking in the 50-65 mph range. A
53-kt gust was measured at KMSL at 1437Z.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0659 AM CST Wed Feb 28 2024

Valid 281300Z - 291200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
APPALACHIAN STATES...AND EASTWARD TO THE EASTERN U.S. COASTAL
PLAIN...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated strong to severe gusts will be possible today from the west
slopes of the Appalachians to western New England, the Mid-Atlantic
Region, and portions of the Carolinas.

...Synopsis...
Mid-level troughing over the central U.S. this morning will continue
to intensify as it gradually takes on a more negative tilt, shifting
eastward across the eastern third of the U.S. through tonight. 
Meanwhile, weak ridging will generally prevail over the West, ahead
of second trough over the Gulf of Alaska digging southeastward
toward the Pacific Northwest.

At the surface, a strong cold front will cross the Appalachians
through midday, and then continue across the eastern U.S., with the
boundary moving off the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts this evening and
lingering only across Florida overnight.  In the West, a cold front
will gradually shift southeastward into/across the Pacific
Northwest.  In between, high pressure will prevail across much of
the country.

...Appalachian states...
Showers and thunderstorms are ongoing this morning from the Lower
Great Lakes region southwestward to the Mississippi Delta, along and
ahead of the advancing cold front.  The strongest storms are ongoing
from the Upper Ohio Valley southwestward across Kentucky, where
occasionally severe storms -- capable of producing damaging wind
gusts and a brief tornado or two -- continue moving eastward.

Instability ahead of the convection weakens with eastward extent,
particularly east of the mountains.  However, pockets of
near-surface-based CAPE in the 250 to 500 J/kg range will be
possible through this afternoon -- enough to support broken/narrow
frontal convective bands until the front moves offshore this
evening.

Despite the very weak instability, the deep-layer wind field will
remain particularly strong -- including 40 to 60 kt as low as 1km
AGL and increasing with height.  As such, potential for convectively
enhanced mixing/downward momentum transport appears to be sufficient
to suggest the possibility if isolated severe-caliber wind gusts. 
This warrants eastward expansion of 5% wind probability/MRGL risk
through the day, with risk ending as the front moves offshore this
evening.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1032 AM CST Tue Feb 27 2024

Valid 271700Z - 281200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE TEXAS PANHANDLE
INTO NORTH-CENTRAL OKLAHOMA...

Modest modifications have been made to the Elevated/Critical areas
based on morning observations and the latest guidance. Ongoing fire
activity in the Texas Panhandle will be exposed to increasing winds
through the day. Furthermore, a wind shift to strong northerly winds
will occur this evening in the southern Plains. See the previous
discussion for additional details.

..Wendt.. 02/27/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0158 AM CST Tue Feb 27 2024/

...Synopsis...
Split mid-level flow will gradually consolidate as a Pacific trough
merges with an increasingly strong subtropical jet stream over the
central CONUS. Very strong westerly flow is expected over the Plains
and Midwest, supporting dry and windy conditions. Widespread
elevated to critical fire-weather conditions are excepted.

...Southern Plains...
As the upper trough begins to move over the Plains, strong low-level
flow is expected to develop by mid morning. Westerly winds of 20-25
mph, with gusts of 30-35 mph, are possible across parts of western
and central OK and the TX Panhandle. Despite dry downsloping and the
unusually warm temperatures, increasing mid and high-level cloud
cover may limit diurnal RH minimums to near 20-25%. Still,
widespread elevated to near/briefly critical fire-weather conditions
appear likely given the increasingly strong wind gusts. Significant
fire activity over the preceding days also suggests fuels are more
receptive than some guidance indicated. Thus, greater confidence
exists for critical conditions across parts of western and central
OK and the eastern TX Panhandle where the strongest winds are
expected to overlap more receptive fuels, despite marginal humidity.

To the east, a pronounced low-level thermal ridge behind a surface
trough will support afternoon RH values below 30% with southwest
winds of 20-25 mph across the eastern Plains into western MO. While
RH values are not overly dry, the strong winds and unusually warm
temperatures should allow for widespread elevated to locally
critical fire-weather conditions.

Fire-weather concerns will begin to diminish later in the evening as
a cold front rapidly moves south. Strong gusts may persist behind
the front along with a rapid wind shift to north/northwesterly.
Cooler temperatures and higher RH behind the front should quickly
limit sustained fire-weather concerns through the overnight hours.

Mesoscale Discussion 0161
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1012 AM CST Tue Feb 27 2024

Areas affected...Eastern CO to northern NE

Concerning...Snow Squall 

Valid 271612Z - 271915Z

SUMMARY...A short-duration moderate to heavy snow band that is
effectively producing sporadic snow squall conditions should spread
east-southeast into early afternoon across parts of eastern Colorado
and northern Nebraska.

DISCUSSION...700-mb frontogenetical forcing for ascent has supported
a narrow band of moderate to heavy snow across a portion of the
Denver Metro Area northeastward into north-central NE, per surface
observations and road cameras. The northeast extent of this band is
well removed from the surface cold front that is marching
south-southeast from IA to north KS and east-central CO. Strong,
post-frontal gradient winds are combining with the narrow snow band
to produce snow squall-like conditions with substantial reduction in
visibility despite the mesoanalysis snow squall parameter holding
less than 0.1. The stronger 700-mb frontogenesis is largely expected
to shift east in NE and gradually weaken while shifting southeast in
eastern CO. This may yield breaks in the ongoing thin band, a
scenario supported by recent RRFS guidance.

Mesoscale Discussion 0160
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0845 AM CST Tue Feb 27 2024

Areas affected...Northwest to north-central MN and southeast ND

Concerning...Blizzard 

Valid 271445Z - 271845Z

SUMMARY...A band of persistent heavy snow with 1-2 inch/hour rates
will shift northeast across northwest and north-central Minnesota
into northwest Ontario. Near-blizzard to blizzard conditions should
continue in its wake where light to moderate snow occurs, mainly
across the Red River Valley.

DISCUSSION...Based on observed snow reports and imagery, a band of
heavy snow is ongoing from the Fargo-Moorhead vicinity northeastward
across northwest MN. This heavy snow band aligns well with 700-mb
frontogenesis and is expected to shift northeast across
north-central MN into northwest Ontario through midday. Meanwhile,
strong to severe gradient winds (gust to 51 kts measured at KFAR)
near and to the backside of this heavy snow band has yielded several
obs with visibility of a half-mile or less. The bulk of the tighter
surface pressure gradient and low-level flow should generally shift
east into the afternoon, suggesting the more persistent
near-blizzard to blizzard conditions should be favored over the Red
River Valley and parts of northwest MN.

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS EVENING
AND TONIGHT OVER PORTIONS OF THE LOWER AND MIDDLE OHIO VALLEY...AND
ACROSS A SMALL PART OF NORTHERN ILLINOIS AND SOUTHEAST WISCONSIN...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms, associated with large hail, damaging gusts,
and tornadoes, some of which may be significant, will be possible
from late this afternoon into the overnight, across portions of the
Ohio Valley and southern Great Lakes.

...OH Valley...
A fast-moving southern-stream shortwave trough over the central
Plains will track eastward today and begin affecting parts of MO by
late afternoon or early evening.  Most 12z guidance suggests that at
least isolated thunderstorm development will begin around/after dusk
as the large-scale forcing overspreads the northern extent of
moist/unstable air mass from southwest MO into southern IL.  These
storms will intensify and track eastward overnight roughly along the
OH river, moving into parts of OH/WV/PA by early morning Wednesday. 
Initial storms may be discrete, with sufficient vertical shear for
supercells structures capable of all severe hazards.  As the night
progresses, activity will likely evolve into fast-moving bowing
structures with an enhanced risk of damaging wind gusts and a few
tornadoes.  A strong tornado or two cannot be ruled out.  Have added
an ENH risk area for this scenario overnight.

...IL/WI...
A compact surface low is forecast to deepen across eastern IA this
afternoon, with a narrow warm sector pulling northward into much of
northern IL.  Strong forcing near the low and along the associated
warm front will lead to intense thunderstorms across portions of
northern IL after 22z.  Forecast soundings show steep low and mid
level lapse rates and sufficient CAPE, along with strong low and
deep layer shear profiles.  This will be conducive to supercell
structures capable of very large hail and damaging winds.  There
remains uncertainty whether these storms will be in the warm-sector,
or will be undercut by nearby cold air.  Have upgraded a small part
of this area to ENH risk for hail, but there is also concern for
tornadoes if the activity remains surface-based.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0204 AM CST Mon Feb 26 2024

Valid 271200Z - 281200Z

...Synopsis...
Across the western US, an amplifying Pacific trough will begin to
phase with intensifying southern stream flow as it crosses the
southern and central Rockies into the Plains. A strong lee low will
move over the central Plains with dry and breezy conditions likely
behind a trailing dryline/surface pressure trough. Favorable
meteorological conditions and at least somewhat receptive fuels
should support widespread elevated to near-critical fire-weather
concerns over parts of the southern Plains.

...southern Plains...
As the aforementioned trough begins to move over the Plains early
D2/Tuesday, strong low-level flow is expected to develop by mid
morning. Westerly winds of 20-25 mph, with gusts of 30-35 mph, are
possible across parts of western and central OK and the TX
Panhandle. Despite dry downsloping and the unusually warm
temperatures, increasing mid and high-level cloud cover may limit
diurnal RH minimums to near 20-25%. Pre-greenup fuels have shown
some drying over the previous days, but remain only partially
receptive to broader fire spread despite the favorable
meteorological conditions. Still, widespread elevated to
near/briefly critical fire-weather conditions appear likely. The
greatest confidence in potentially longer-lived critical conditions
is across parts of western and central OK and the eastern TX
Panhandle where the strongest winds are expected to overlap more
receptive fuels for the greatest duration.

Fire-weather concerns will begin to diminish later in the evening as
a cold front rapidly moves south. Strong gusts may persist behind
the front along with a rapid wind shift to north/northwesterly.
Cooler temperatures and higher RH behind the front should quickly
limit sustained fire-weather concerns through the overnight hours.

...Midwest...
Farther to the northeast, gusty southwest winds and very warm/dry
conditions are expected southwest of the advancing low across parts
of MO and western IL. A pronounced low-level thermal ridge
overlaying southwest winds of 20-30 mph may support brief elevated
or locally critical fire-weather conditions Tuesday afternoon. Area
fuels have shown increased dryness over the past several days, but
remain partially receptive to fire spread. Thus, confidence in
sustained fire-weather conditions is low.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0612 PM CST Sat Feb 24 2024

Valid 250100Z - 251200Z

...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms are not forecast the rest of tonight.

...01z Update...

Northwesterly flow is deepening across the Carolinas this evening as
the primary corridor of low-level convergence focuses offshore in
response to the progressive short-wave trough. While a few showers
will linger across Coastal Carolinas this evening, the prospect for
lightning is lessening with this activity given the weakening
low-level lapse rates/buoyancy (nocturnal cooling) and downstream
convergence.
