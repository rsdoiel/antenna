Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0145 PM CST Fri Dec 15 2023

Valid 152000Z - 161200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
The risk for severe thunderstorms appears negligible across the U.S.
through tonight.

...20Z Update...
Lightning has diminished with convection embedded within a band of
precipitation, ahead of mid-level troughing slowly progressing
across the Great Plains.  Stronger mid/upper support and colder air
aloft, associated with a remnant embedded low, appear to be shifting
northeast of the better low-level moisture return off the
northwestern Gulf, and potential for renewed thunderstorm activity
may be low in the near term.  However, as the trailing flank of the
mid-level troughing begins to dig across central Texas, toward the
coastal plain, guidance suggests that probabilities for scattered
weak thunderstorm activity may increase across parts of
eastern/southeastern Texas later this evening or overnight.

..Kerr.. 12/15/2023

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1020 AM CST Fri Dec 15 2023/

...Discussion...
A central U.S. upper trough -- flanked by ridging over both eastern
and western portions of the country -- will shift slowly eastward
today and tonight.  In response, very weak surface cyclogenesis will
occur, with a low expected to reside over the southern
Iowa/northwestern Missouri area early Saturday morning. 

Ahead of this low, and the associated/trailing weak surface
trough/front, very little in the way of moisture return is expected,
given the northeasterly/northerly cyclonic flow over the northern
and western Gulf of Mexico.  As such, an overall lack of buoyancy
with this system suggests only occasional/sporadic lightning through
tonight -- primarily across the eastern Texas/western
Louisiana/Arklatex area.

A few flashes may also occur across southern Florida and the Keys
later in the period, within easterly low-level flow east of the weak
southern Gulf surface low.  

Elsewhere, thunderstorms are not expected.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0142 PM CST Fri Dec 15 2023

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Southern CA...
Locally elevated offshore winds and low humidity are possible early
Saturday and into early Sunday across parts of southern CA. High
pressure over the interior West will continue to support moderate
offshore pressure gradients and dry conditions. A few hours of
breezy winds greater than 15-20 mph and RH below 20% are possible.
However, weak upper-level support and spotty fuels should keep
broader concerns limited. Elsewhere across the country, seasonably
cool and moist conditions will negate fire-weather concerns.

..Lyons.. 12/15/2023

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0146 AM CST Fri Dec 15 2023/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will deepen across the eastern CONUS as a surface
cyclone deepens across the eastern Gulf of Mexico and traverses the
Florida Peninsula. Surface high pressure should overspread most of
the rest of the CONUS, promoting relatively cooler surface
conditions amid poorly receptive fuels, dampening significant
wildfire-spread potential.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1121 AM CST Fri Dec 15 2023

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS LATE SATURDAY
EVENING THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT ACROSS MUCH OF THE CENTRAL AND 
SOUTHERN FLORIDA PENINSULA AND KEYS...

...SUMMARY...
Strong thunderstorms may impact the Florida Peninsula and Keys
Saturday night, with a few possibly becoming severe and posing a
risk for tornadoes and damaging wind gusts.

...Synopsis...
Stronger, more zonal westerlies will remain confined to the northern
mid-latitudes through this period, while flow remains more amplified
in lower latitudes.  The latter regime will include a broad and
deep, occluded cyclone over the southern mid-latitude eastern
Pacific and prominent downstream mid/upper ridging across the
Pacific coast and much of the Intermountain West.

Farther downstream, developments, particularly in the shorter
wavelengths, remain more unclear.  The axis of mean larger-scale
mid-level troughing is forecast to dig across and east-southeast of
the Mississippi Valley Saturday through Saturday night.  This may
include one embedded short wave perturbation digging across the 
Texas Gulf coast, before coming in phase with amplifying short wave
troughing in a branch of westerlies emanating from the subtropical
eastern Pacific, across the northwestern into central Gulf of
Mexico.

Surface cyclogenesis may already be underway along a remnant frontal
zone across the south central Gulf of Mexico at the outset of the
period, associated with a preceding subtropical perturbation. 
Substantive further deepening of this cyclone appears probable, but
notable differences in its evolution remain apparent within the
various model output, particularly as it approaches and crosses the
central through northeastern Florida vicinity during the evening and
overnight hours.

...Florida Peninsula...
Given the model spread concerning the cyclone evolution, coupled
with initially dry and stable boundary-layer conditions across much
of the peninsula early Saturday and potential increasing inhibition
associated with pronounced mid/upper warming Saturday into Saturday
night, the risk for severe weather still appears largely conditional
at this point.  However, destabilization associated with rapid
low-level moistening within the inland spreading warm sector,
coincident with strengthening deep-layer shear and enlarging,
clockwise-curved low-level hodographs, could become sufficient for
organized convection, including supercells, with potential to
produce tornadoes and damaging wind gusts.  

Given this concern, slight risk probabilities will be maintained,
and extended southward through the remainder of the peninsula and
Florida Keys.  However, highest severe probabilities may ultimately
become focused near and just inland of coastal areas between Tampa
and Fort Myers Saturday evening, and near/offshore east central and
southeast coastal areas overnight, where low-level forcing and
destabilization will be most favorable.

Isolated thunderstorms will be possible this evening into tonight

...DISCUSSION...
An upper-level trough will move across the Desert Southwest this
evening, as southwesterly mid-level flow remains over the southern
Rockies and southern High Plains. A 40 to 50 knot low-level jet will
strengthen across west Texas. Lift associated with the low-level
jet, along with large-scale ascent ahead of the approaching system,
will make isolated thunderstorm development possible late this
evening into tonight. No severe threat is forecast, and
thunderstorms are not expected over the remainder of the continental
U.S. through tonight.

Valid 141200Z - 201200Z

Fire weather potential continues to appear limited for the duration
of the extended period. Recent surface observations show a
strengthening surface high over the central Plains. This feature
will continue to amplify over the coming day as it migrates into the
eastern third of the country. Latest water-vapor imagery also
depicts an upper disturbance drifting southeast from the Great Basin
into the Four Corners region. This feature will introduce widespread
rain chances across the southern High Plains to the Southeast over
the mid to late week period. The combination of weak winds in
proximity to the surface high and cool/wet conditions should limit
most fire weather concerns.

...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms are not expected in the U.S. through tonight.

...Synopsis/Discussion...
In mid/upper levels, cyclonic flow will remain over the East, but
will lose amplitude in response to two processes:
1.  The eastward ejection of a substantial trough now over the Lower
Great Lakes and Mid-Atlantic region.  The associated low-level cold
front is in the process of clearing the New England Coast, with the
surface-based buoyancy well south of the area, and another couple
hours of 100-300 J/kg MUCAPE largely confined to between the top of
a stable boundary layer and the -20 deg C thermal level.  While a
rogue flash cannot be ruled out around Cape Cod, lightning potential
appears too low and isolated to introduce a general-thunder area. 
2.  Amplification and slow eastward shift of initially weak
troughing now over the Pacific Coast vicinity, reaching interior
OR/western ID, northwestern NV, and east-central/southwestern CA by
the end of the period.  Associated strengthening DCVA/cooling aloft
should remain too displaced from enough elevated moisture to support
a thunderstorm area until day 2.
