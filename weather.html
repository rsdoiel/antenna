Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1032 AM CDT Fri Apr 12 2024

Valid 121700Z - 131200Z

No changes to the ongoing forecast.

..Wendt.. 04/12/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0200 AM CDT Fri Apr 12 2024/

...Synopsis...
In the wake of the upper-level cyclone departing to the east,
transient ridging aloft will give way to increasingly strong
southwest flow over the southern Rockies. An embedded perturbation
passing overhead will aid in deepening a lee trough over parts of
the southern High Plains Friday. Downslope surface winds are
forecast to increase through afternoon over part of eastern NM and
southeastern CO. Dry southerly return flow is also possible across
parts of the TX Rio Grande Valley. The gusty winds and low humidity
will likely support elevated to locally critical fire-weather
conditions.

...Northeast New Mexico and southern Colorado...
As flow aloft begins to strengthen ahead of the approaching
shortwave trough, a deepening lee trough will bolster westerly
surface flow over northeastern NM and southern CO. Dry downslope
trajectories and daytime heating should support widespread minimum
RH values of 10-15%. Overlapping with sustained surface winds of
15-25 mph, and dry fuels devoid of recent rainfall, several hours of
elevated to locally critical fire-weather conditions are likely over
parts of NM and southern CO.

...Texas Rio Grande Valley...
To the east of the deepening lee trough, southerly winds are forest
to increase through much of the day with the approach of the
upper-level shortwave trough. With limited surface moisture in place
behind the previous frontal passage, dry return flow is expected
over parts of South TX and the central Rio Grande Valley. Periodic
surface wind gusts of 15-20 mph and diurnal RH minimums of 15-20%
may support a few hours of elevated fire-weather conditions.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0748 AM CDT Fri Apr 12 2024

Valid 121300Z - 131200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
NORTHERN NEVADA...EASTERN OREGON...IDAHO...AND FAR WESTERN
MONTANA...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe wind gusts and hail may occur with thunderstorms
over northern Nevada, eastern Oregon, Idaho, and far western Montana
late this afternoon and early evening.

...Northern Nevada into Eastern Oregon, Idaho, and Far Western
Montana...
An upper low over the eastern Pacific will dig southward towards the
northern/central CA Coast through tonight, with a belt of moderately
enhanced flow extending over parts of the Northwest. Low-level
moisture across the northern Great Basin into the northern Rockies
is expected to remain quite meager, with PW values generally around
0.7 inch or less. Even so, daytime heating should encourage a very
well-mixed boundary layer to develop by later this afternoon as a
surface low consolidates over northern NV. Isolated to scattered
thunderstorms should develop this afternoon from parts of northern
NV and eastern OR into ID and eventually western MT. With up to 500
J/kg of MLCAPE present amid sufficient deep-layer for some updraft
organization, some of this activity could become strong to severe.
Isolated severe wind gusts may occur with any convective downdrafts,
as low/mid-level lapse rates will likely be quite steep. Occasional
hail also appears possible with the more robust cores. Convection
should weaken this evening with eastward extent into ID/western MT
with the loss of daytime heating.

...Ohio Valley into the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast...
Low-topped thunderstorms should develop along a cold front this
morning into the afternoon across parts of the Northeast. Poor lapse
rates, weak buoyancy, and generally meridional flow at low/mid
levels across eastern NY into parts of southern New England will
likely hinder an organized severe threat from developing.

A separate area of convection may develop this afternoon across
parts of the OH Valley into the central Appalachians and perhaps
Carolinas. This activity will be tied to cold mid-level temperatures
associated with a shortwave trough embedded within a broad upper
trough/low over the eastern CONUS. With generally west-northwesterly
flow behind a front, instability should remain very weak. Still,
enhanced low-level winds may reach the surface with a well-mixed
boundary layer, and occasional strong/gusty winds could occur this
afternoon.

Mesoscale Discussion 0420
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0933 AM CDT Thu Apr 11 2024

Areas affected...northern and central Florida

Concerning...Tornado Watch 104...

Valid 111433Z - 111630Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 104 continues.

SUMMARY...A broken band of thunderstorms continues moving eastward
across northern Florida, where local severe-weather risk continues.

DISCUSSION...Latest radar loop shows a loosely organized band of
thunderstorms extending from the southeastern Georgia coast
southwestward to the eastern Gulf of Mexico west of Tampa.  Storms
have remained largely sub-severe despite very favorable deep-layer
shear, due to an overall lack of appreciable buoyancy.  The 12Z TBW
RAOB shows a deeply moist airmass, but very weak lapse rates, with
several warm layers that hint at subdued updraft acceleration,
confirming the character of convection at this time per radar
reflectivity.

With that said, filtered heating through high cirrus ahead of the
convection has allowed heating to commence, with surface
temperatures having risen a few degrees over the past 1 to 2 hours. 
Continued insolation/heating will allow destabilization eventually
permit more unimpeded updrafts, and a corresponding increase in
convective intensity/organization, aided by the favorable background
kinematic environment.  As such, local severe risk -- including
isolated tornado potential -- should gradually increase over the
next couple of hours.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0214 AM CDT Thu Apr 11 2024

Valid 121200Z - 131200Z

...Synopsis...
Fire weather conditions are anticipated across a broad swath of the
Southwest and southern High Plains on Friday afternoon. However, the
fire weather threat will most likely be focused across parts of New
Mexico and the OK/TX Panhandles where the best overlap of fire
weather conditions and receptive fuels is anticipated. Surface high
pressure is forecast to shift from the central Plains into the
northwest Gulf of Mexico. Concurrently, the approach of an upper
wave off the southern CA coast will lead to broad surface pressure
falls across the southern Great Basin into the southern High Plains,
resulting in breezy pressure gradient winds.

...New Mexico and adjacent areas of the OK/TX Panhandles...
Latest guidance continues to show a signal for 15-20 mph winds
across a broad swath of eastern NM and west TX. Low-level
trajectories emanating off the terrain of northern Mexico, combined
with a recent frontal intrusion into the western Gulf, should
maintain dry conditions across the southern High Plains with RH
values in the 10-20% range. Elevated conditions are expected with
localized critical conditions possible Friday afternoon. Despite the
potential for widespread fire weather conditions, the risk area is
confined to locations that have not seen wetting rainfall over the
past few days (and hence should have the most receptive fuels).
Based on recent fuel analyses, ERCs further west into the
Southwest/Great Basin are near/below the 50th percentile, which
precludes a more widespread risk area (though fuel trends will be
monitored).

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 101
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
600 AM CDT Wed Apr 10 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Southeast Louisiana
  Central and Southern Mississippi
  Coastal Waters

* Effective this Wednesday morning and afternoon from 600 AM
  until 100 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A few tornadoes likely with a couple intense tornadoes possible
  Widespread damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 80
    mph likely
  Scattered large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...A destabilizing airmass across the central Gulf Coast will
support an increasing severe thunderstorm and tornado risk this
morning into the midday.  The tornado risk will likely maximize with
any supercells that develop within the warm sector as the marine
warm front advances northward.  A squall line will move west to east
across the area with a risk for damaging gusts and the tornado risk
will likely focus with any sustained mesovortex or embedded
supercell.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 85 statute miles
east and west of a line from 95 miles northwest of Meridian MS to 45
miles west southwest of Boothville LA. For a complete depiction of
the watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS
WOU1).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements

Mesoscale Discussion 0395
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0848 AM CDT Tue Apr 09 2024

Areas affected...Portions of central/east TX into northwestern LA

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 091348Z - 091545Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...A watch may be needed as the threat for tornadoes, large
hail, and damaging winds gradually increases this morning.

DISCUSSION...Warm advection associated with a 35-45 kt southerly
low-level jet, along with ascent attendant to the left exit region
of a southwesterly mid/upper-level jet, is aiding convection across
parts of central/east TX into northwestern LA. Some of this activity
across central TX is occurring near a convectively reinforced
outflow boundary, with a rich low-level airmass present along/south
of this boundary. Steep mid-level lapse rates are supporting
1500-2000 J/kg of MLCAPE in central TX, even though daytime heating
remains muted thus far, with lesser instability into east TX and
northwestern LA. Still, strong deep-layer shear of 50+ kt will
foster updraft organization and supercell potential. Large to very
large hail will be a concern with these supercells as they spread
east-northeastward this morning. An increasing potential for
severe/damaging winds may be realized if a cluster forms along the
outflow boundary/front. Sufficient low-level shear is also present
for low-level updraft rotation and some tornado threat. Watch
issuance may be needed if convection continues to increase in
coverage and intensity across central TX.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 94
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
940 AM CDT Tue Apr 9 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Central Texas

* Effective this Tuesday morning and afternoon from 940 AM until
  500 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A few tornadoes possible
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2.5
    inches in diameter likely
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...Several thunderstorm clusters, including a mix of
supercells and bowing line segments, are expected along a stalled
front across central Texas through the afternoon.  More isolated
supercell development will be possible later this morning into early
this afternoon into the I-35 corridor closer to Austin.  The storm
environment will support the potential for large hail up to 2.5
inches in diameter, damaging gusts of 60-70 mph, and potentially a
few tornadoes.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 40 statute miles
north and south of a line from 50 miles west of Austin TX to 140
miles east northeast of Temple TX. For a complete depiction of the
watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU4).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 2.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 60 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 550. Mean
storm motion vector 25025.
