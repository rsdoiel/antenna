Mesoscale Discussion 1742
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0909 AM CDT Tue Jul 30 2024

Areas affected...portions of southern Illinois and southern Indiana
into north-central Kentucky

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 567...

Valid 301409Z - 301615Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 567
continues.

SUMMARY...Severe thunderstorms posing a damaging wind risk will
persist across southern Illinois within Severe Thunderstorm Watch
567. Areas across southern Indiana into adjacent north-central
Kentucky are being monitored for possible downstream watch issuance.

DISCUSSION...A small, but well organized bowing cluster of storms
continues to track east/southeast across south-central Illinois this
morning. This activity has produced gusts near 50 kt within the past
hour. Around 30 kt effective shear magnitudes are likely sustaining
organized activity as convection shifts east/southeast along an
instability gradient oriented northwest to southeast across the
lower Ohio Valley vicinity. A very moist downstream airmass is
evident, with surface dewpoints in the 70s. With continued heating,
boundary-layer inhibition is expected to quickly erode by midday.
Damaging gusts may continue downstream of ongoing activity,
especially if additional convection can develop on the southern
flank of the ongoing cluster. Visible satellite imagery shows
deepening cumulus ahead of the southern flank, so this evolution
appears plausible. A downstream watch may be needed within the next
hour or so if current trends persist/increase.

Mesoscale Discussion 1741
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0847 AM CDT Tue Jul 30 2024

Areas affected...portions of southern Iowa...northern Missouri...and
extreme west-central Illinois

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 301347Z - 301515Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Damaging gusts are possible this morning and afternoon as
a cluster of storms tracks southeast across southern Iowa into
northern Missouri and extreme west-central Illinois. A watch may be
needed this morning, though timing is uncertain.

DISCUSSION...A well organized cluster of storms currently moving
into central Iowa has produced gusts near 50 kt within the past 30
minutes or so. This activity may be somewhat elevated in the wake of
overnight convection. Nevertheless, 35-45 kt effective shear
magnitudes and MLCAPE around 1000-1500 J/kg will likely maintain
organization. While outflow from overnight convection has surged
southward to near I-70 in Missouri, the airmass has shown signs of
quick recovery, with surface dewpoints in the mid/upper 60s F noted
in 13z surface obs. Clear skies ahead of the cluster will also allow
for quick heating through the morning hours. As a result, downstream
destabilization and erosion of capping is expected. 

The ongoing cluster of storms may continue to gradually intensify
and pose a risk for damaging gusts into late morning/early afternoon
as the downstream airmass continue to recover/destabilize. Given the
effect of overnight convection on the airmass, there is some
uncertainty in convective evolution and timing of possible watch
issuance. Nevertheless, it appears possible a severe thunderstorm
watch could be needed this morning across parts of the discussion
area.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 568
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
930 AM CDT Tue Jul 30 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Southern Iowa
  Far West-Central Illinois
  Northeast Missouri

* Effective this Tuesday morning and afternoon from 930 AM until
  400 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging winds likely with isolated significant gusts
    to 75 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...A cluster of thunderstorms will likely continue moving
southeastward this morning and afternoon. The greatest risk should
be scattered to numerous damaging/severe winds around 60-75 mph, but
isolated hail and perhaps a tornado may also occur.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 60
statute miles east and west of a line from 40 miles west northwest
of Knoxville IA to 45 miles southwest of Quincy IL. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU8).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 567...

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
1.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 65 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
31035.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0804 AM CDT Tue Jul 30 2024

Valid 301300Z - 311200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
MIDDLE MISSOURI VALLEY/MIDWEST...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
NORTHERN/CENTRAL PLAINS TO THE SOUTHEAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe storms are expected today into tonight across a broad area
from eastern Nebraska and Iowa into parts of the Midwest, Tennessee
Valley and southern Appalachians, with swaths of damaging winds
possible within this corridor. Severe storms are also possible
across parts of the northern Plains.

...Central Plains/Upper Midwest to OH/TN Valleys...
Very challenging meteorological scenario with highly variable
guidance as far as MCS development/disposition today. However, a
rather favorable set of ingredients will generally coincide,
spanning east/northeast Nebraska into Iowa, northern Missouri and
western Illinois, and to some extent even farther southeastward into
the Tennessee Valley. Very strong buoyancy will exist within this
MCS/outflow-reinforced corridor, with a strong elevated mixed layer
-- yet not overly warm aloft for the season -- atop a moist boundary
layer. Seasonally strong west-northwesterly winds aloft will also
reside in this general corridor, with potential for multiple
east/southeastward-moving MCSs today and tonight. Swath of damaging
wind gusts (potentially in excess of 75 mph) are plausible.

With a remnant thunderstorm cluster across Illinois, some
re-intensification of this convection may occur across the lower
Ohio Valley toward the Tennessee Valley, with a modestly strong
northwesterly flow regime and ample downstream instability. Isolated
to scattered damaging wind should be the primary threat. 

Meanwhile, multiple thunderstorm clusters across Siouxland this
morning from southeast South Dakota into northwest/western Iowa may
continue to pose a severe risk, with some potential that these
storms could merge/organize later today along the instability
gradient. There is also potential that additional storm development
may occur by late afternoon/early evening across northern
Nebraska/far southern South Dakota near a surface low/troughs, with
these storms potentially increasing and evolving into an MCS
tonight, aided by a nocturnally strengthening low-level jet.

...Northern Plains...
Weak height falls amid moderate to strong instability may lead to
widely scattered thunderstorm development along a surface
trough/dryline across the Dakotas this afternoon. Moderate
westerlies should support moderate deep-layer vertical shear around
30-35 kt, sufficient for a few organized storms capable of both
large hail and damaging gusts.

...Northern New York to northern New England...
Moderate buoyancy may develop this afternoon from northern New York
into northern New England. While storm coverage remains somewhat
uncertain, deep-layer shear and relatively cool temperatures aloft
could support a couple modestly organized storms capable of locally
damaging wind, and possibly some hail. 

...Mid-Atlantic vicinity...
A mid/upper-level trough and possibly an MCV will move across the
Mid Atlantic vicinity later today. Scattered thunderstorm
development is expected by afternoon from northern Virginia into
parts of Pennsylvania. While there is some uncertainty regarding the
extent of heating and destabilization, a couple stronger
cells/clusters may become capable of producing isolated damaging
winds.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0158 AM CDT Mon Jul 29 2024

Valid 301200Z - 311200Z

...Synopsis...
A midlevel trough will advance eastward across the northern Rockies
and adjacent High Plains during the day, while broad/enhanced
west-southwesterly flow aloft persists across the Great Basin.

...Northern Rockies/Intermountain West... 
Large-scale ascent accompanying the eastward-moving midlevel trough
will promote widely scattered thunderstorms across portions of the
northern Rockies/Intermountain West into the northern Plains during
the afternoon and evening. While many of these storms will be
capable of producing measurable rainfall, quick eastward-moving
storms (around 25-35 mph) will still favor a mix of wet/dry
thunderstorms over dry fuels. As a result, some lightning-induced
ignitions will be possible -- especially along the peripheries of
any rain cores.

...Great Basin...
Boundary-layer mixing into the modestly enhanced west-southwesterly
flow aloft will lead to locally dry/breezy conditions across parts
of the Great Basin during the afternoon. While locally elevated
conditions are possible, winds should be slightly weaker than the
day prior, and the overall threat appears too localized for an
Elevated area at this time.
