Mesoscale Discussion 0860
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0321 PM CDT Sun May 18 2025

Areas affected...much of western Oklahoma...southwest
Kansas...extreme eastern Panhandle

Concerning...Severe potential...Tornado Watch likely 

Valid 182021Z - 182215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered supercells capable of strong tornadoes and very
large hail are forecast from late afternoon into the evening from
parts of northwest Oklahoma into southwest Kansas. EF3+ tornadoes
may occur.

DISCUSSION...Surface analysis and visible imagery clearly outline
the unstable warm sector, situated between a dryline from southeast
CO into the eastern TX Panhandle, and a warm front/retreating
outflow draped across northern OK into south-central KS. The air
mass has become very unstable, and will continue to develop
northward. This air mass is coincident with an already strongly
sheared environment with effective SRH over 200 m2/s2. These
low-level shear values will increase markedly later today and during
the evening as the low level jet increases with effective SRH of
300-400 m2/s2 common.

While very cool air and clouds currently exist over northern OK into
south-central KS, a strengthening low-level jet will likely yield
clearing later in the evening, which may allow the tornado threat to
expand farther eastward.

Mesoscale Discussion 0859
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0212 PM CDT Sun May 18 2025

Areas affected...northeast Colorado...western Nebraska...northwest
Kansas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 181912Z - 182145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...Supercells capable of very large hail, tornadoes, and
damaging wind are likely to develop after 21Z over northeast
Colorado, spreading into western Nebraska and northwest Kansas
through evening.

DISCUSSION...A surface low continues to deepen over eastern CO as
the shortwave trough moves across the area. Surface analysis shows a
prominent plume of low-level moisture extending out of western KS
and across northeast CO, where dewpoints are holding in the lower
50s F. 

Full heating near and south of this moisture plume will erode the
minimal capping inversion by around 21Z, and rapid thunderstorm
development is expected. The combination of strong instability,
steep lapse rates, and veering winds with height will strongly favor
supercells capable of very large hail, and a few tornadoes. Activity
should easily remain severe into NE and KS this evening as the
southeasterly low-level jet persists, maintaining moisture advection
as well as shear and inflow.

Mesoscale Discussion 0858
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0158 PM CDT Sun May 18 2025

Areas affected...Northwest to west-central Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 181858Z - 182130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm development along the dryline is expected
roughly between 20-22 UTC across northwest to west-central Texas.
The convective environment will support supercells capable of large
hail, severe gusts, and a few tornadoes. Watch issuance is likely as
storms begin to develop.

DISCUSSION...Recent GOES visible imagery shows shallow, but slowly
deepening, cumulus along and just ahead of a sharpening dryline as
it continues to mix east and boundary-layer depth increases amid
filtered diurnal heating. Latest RAP/HRRR forecast soundings suggest
any lingering MLCIN will be minimized as surface temperatures warm
into the 92-95 F range over the next few hours within the warm
sector. Regional VWPs show flow within the lowest 2-3 km AGL
oriented roughly along the dryline, which should promote adequate
residence times for parcels to reach their LFCs and initiate deep
convection. Latest high-res solutions suggest this should occur
generally between 20-22 UTC. Thunderstorms will mature within a very
unstable air mass with MLCAPE values exceeding 4000 J/kg and
effective shear on the order of 40-50 knots. Limited directional
shear will initially promote splitting supercells with an attendant
very large hail threat (most probable max hail size may be 2-3
inches in diameter). Southeasterly low-level winds across northwest
TX may support adequate low-level veering for some tornado threat.
Further south (roughly south of I-20), 1.5 to 2.5 km LCL heights and
more backed low-level flow will modulate the initial tornado
potential. After 00 UTC a strengthening low-level jet will increase
low-level hodograph curvature and support an increasing tornado
threat with any remaining discrete right-moving supercells across
much of central/northern TX. Watch issuance will likely be needed as
thunderstorm initiation becomes more imminent.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0308 PM CDT Sun May 18 2025

Valid 201200Z - 261200Z

Mainly zonal flow will overspread the western and central CONUS
through at least mid-week, before upper ridging sets in by the end
of the week and a mid-level trough traverses the Interior West this
weekend. Surface high pressure should overspread much of the western
and central CONUS through the week, with surface lee troughing and
accompanying moisture return likely across the Plains states by this
weekend as the upper trough approaches. The net result will be
quiescent fire weather conditions across much of the CONUS for the
week. Warm and dry conditions will prevail across the Southwest into
the weekend, which will encourage further curing of fuels.

At the moment, there is some disagreement among medium-range
guidance members concerning the timing and evolution of the weekend
upper trough. As such, confidence in the placement and timing of
overlapping dry and windy conditions across the Southwest is too low
for the introduction of Critical probabilities at this time.
However, if the medium-range guidance comes into better consensus
for dry/windy conditions atop drying fuels, Critical probabilities
may eventually be needed.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0305 PM CDT Sun May 18 2025

Valid 182000Z - 191200Z

...THERE IS A MODERATE RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR SOUTHWEST
AND CENTRAL KANSAS INTO FAR NORTHWEST OKLAHOMA...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM EASTERN
MISSISSIPPI...CENTRAL ALABAMA...AND SOUTHERN GEORGIA...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms capable of all severe hazards are expected this
afternoon and evening across portions of the central and southern
Plains.  Several strong to intense tornadoes are possible.

...20z Update...
Adjustments were made to the current D1 Convective Outlook to the
Slight across the Southeast to account for latest trends in radar
and observations. A couple of broken line segments of thunderstorms
continue to pose a risk for damaging wind in these regions.

Elsewhere, the higher risk area across the central and southern
Plains continues to be where potential for all hazards will be
possible. The current plume of mid-level cloud cover extending from
central to eastern OK into southern KS continues to pose some
uncertainty on how the situation will unfold this afternoon.
Clearing across southwestern OK has allowed for heating and the
agitated cu field continues on visible satellite imagery. Further
into Kansas, clouds are more persistent but there is a narrow region
of warming from the Oklahoma Panhandle into Dodge City. CAM guidance
is spread on exactly how storms will evolve this afternoon, but it
appears supercell development is likely across the dryline in
western Oklahoma and Kansas this afternoon. Should a discrete mode
maintain, very large hail and tornadoes will be possible. As the
afternoon/evening progresses, the low level jet will increase
through time with moisture advection increasing into central
Oklahoma and southern Kansas. Should supercells be maintained, this
could pose a risk for a strong tornado.

See previous discussion for more information.

..Thornton.. 05/18/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1222 PM CDT Sun May 18 2025/

...KS/OK...
A large upper trough continues to deepen over the western US, with a
band of 60-70 knot southwesterly mid-level flow extending across NM
into western KS/OK.  The surface dryline will mix eastward into
western KS and along the TX/OK border by mid-afternoon, with the air
mass to the east becoming extremely unstable with dewpoints in the
upper 60s and MLCAPE values over 4000 J/kg.  Strong
southerly/southeasterly low-level winds throughout the warm sector
will provide a conditionally favorable environment for intense
supercells capable of very large hail, damaging winds, and
tornadoes.  However, morning model guidance continues to show
diverse solutions regarding coverage of convection later today.  

The area of greatest confidence in storm development and intensity
will be near the warm front/dryline triple point over south-central
KS.  Discrete supercell development appears likely here, with
forecast soundings showing favorable hodograph structures to promote
a risk of strong tornadoes.  The MDT risk has been extending
slightly eastward along the warm front.  Farther south along the
dryline in western OK, confidence in initiation is lower.  However,
any storm that can form will be capable of all hazards.

...Western North TX...
Another region of higher confidence in convective initiation will be
over western north TX along the dryline.  Hot surface temperatures
in vicinity of a dryline bulge will aid in storm development.  These
storms will likely expand eastward and into southwest OK through the
evening, with very large hail and damaging winds possible.

...MS/AL/GA...
A narrow corridor of SLGT risk has been added for this afternoon
from eastern MS across central AL and southern GA.  Multiple MCSs
are ongoing in this corridor, with associated outflow boundaries
present.  These boundaries may be the focus for further development
this afternoon, with sufficient CAPE/shear combinations to pose a
risk of damaging winds in the strongest cells.

Severe thunderstorms are likely across portions of the Ohio Valley,
Mid-Mississippi Valley, and Tennessee Valley on Tuesday.

...Mid-Mississippi Valley into the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys...

A shortwave upper trough will develop east across the region on
Tuesday, bringing enhanced southwesterly mid/upper flow atop a very
moist airmass. A surface low over northern MO will shift east across
IL/IN and into OH by Wednesday morning. Mid-60s to low 70s F
dewpoints will be in place to the south of a warm front draped
across central IL/IN into northern KY by midday. A trailing cold
front will shift east/southeast across the Ozarks toward the
Mid-South during the afternoon, and across the TN and Lower MS
Valley overnight. Moderate to strong destabilization ahead of the
cold front and strong vertical shear will support organized
convection capable of all severe hazards.

Guidance varies, but convection will likely be ongoing in the
vicinity of the warm front Tuesday morning from parts of IL into IN
and perhaps KY. The exact location and extent of this activity will
influence severe potential across the Ohio Valley during the
afternoon. There is some potential that if morning convection does
not dilute the favorable airmass across KY that higher severe
probabilities may need to be extended northward in subsequent
outlooks. 

Otherwise, initial supercells are expected to develop ahead of the
cold front across the Mid-South during the afternoon. This activity
will pose a risk for large hail, strong gusts and tornadoes. With
time, convection is expected to develop upscale into one or more
bowing segments while shifting east across the TN Valley into the
evening/overnight hours. An increasing risk for damaging winds will
occur with upscale development and some potential for a swath of
significant gusts is possible across the TN Valley vicinity.

...NC Vicinity...

A warm front is forecast to lift northward across the region during
the day, allowing for a corridor of rich boundary-layer moisture to
spread across parts of SC/NC/western VA. Vertically veering,
supercell wind profiles along this boundary, and MLCAPE to 1500 J/kg
MLCAPE is evident in forecast soundings. This could support a few
strong to severe storms during the late afternoon or evening as
modest height falls overspread the region.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN
NEW MEXICO INTO FAR WEST TEXAS...

The previous forecast remains on track, with westward/eastward
extensions of Critical/Elevated highlights (respectively) made to
account for the latest guidance consensus. Please see the previous
forecast (below) for more details.

..Squitieri.. 05/18/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0112 AM CDT Sun May 18 2025/

...Synopsis...
As a mid-level trough moves out of the Great Basin and into the
southern Great Plains on Monday, dry down-slope winds behind a
dryline in southern New Mexico into far western Texas will result in
Critical fire-weather conditions. Additionally, some persistent
northerly flow over central California will result in Elevated
fire-weather conditions across portions of the San Joaquin valley. 

...Southern New Mexico into Far Western Texas...
Westerly down-slope winds in New Mexico beneath a progressive
mid-level trough, along with deep boundary-layer mixing and a
deepening surface cyclone, will result in widespread Critical
fire-weather conditions across southern New Mexico Monday afternoon.
Winds in excess of 25 MPH with relative humidity at or below 10%
will overspread a region of fuels that are at or above the 90th
annual ERC percentiles, and will result in conditions that support
rapid wildfire ignition and spread. Some locally Extremely Critical
conditions may occur, with winds in excess of 30 MPH, across
portions of southern New Mexico. However, they appear too localized
for highlights at this time. 

...Central California...
Ensemble guidance suggests that deep boundary-layer mixing beneath
persistent mid-level northerly flow will result in Elevated
fire-weather conditions. While fuels are on the more marginal side,
15+ MPH winds and relative humidity at or below 15% will support at
least Elevated highlights.

Valid 191200Z - 201200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS
OF THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN PLAINS INTO THE OZARKS...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM MIDDLE
TENNESSEE INTO SOUTH CAROLINA...

...SUMMARY...
Severe storms with all severe weather hazards are expected from the
central/southern Plains into the Ozarks on Monday.

...Central/Southern Plains to the Mid-Mississippi Valley...

An uncertain and potentially messy convective scenario is apparent
across the region on Monday. An upper trough over the southern
Rockies will become negatively tilted as it ejects across the
central/southern Plains toward the Mid-MS Valley. As this occurs, a
southwesterly 500 mb jet streak around 70-80 kt will overspread the
region. By early evening and into the overnight hours, an 850-700 mb
low-level jet will increase to around 45-55 kt. 

At the surface, a somewhat elongated low will extend from central NE
into western KS/OK, with some forecast guidance suggesting a
secondary low pressure center developing over northwest OK during
late afternoon/early evening. At midday, a dryline will extend
southward from central KS into western OK and central TX while a
cold front develop east/southwest across NE and western KS. A warm
front will extend from southeast NE into northern MO and then
eastward into the Lower OH Valley. The warm front is not forecast to
move much through the forecast period. Between these surface
boundaries, a moisture-rich boundary layer will be in place with mid
60s to low 70s F dewpoints across a broad zone from eastern KS/OK/TX
toward the Mid-South. A plume of steep midlevel lapse rates atop
this moist boundary layer will result in strong destabilization by
early afternoon, with MLCAPE around 2500-3500 J/kg common.
Vertically veering, supercell wind profiles, becoming
elongated/straight above 2-3 km will be present. Low-level
hodographs initially will be somewhat small, but should become
enlarged as the low-level jet increases toward evening. 

Capping is expected to erode by early to mid afternoon across the
region. Convective evolution is uncertain. Most guidance develops
quite a bit of thunderstorms rather early in the afternoon across
portions of the Ozarks where 850 mb warm air advection will be
maximized. While initial supercells could be possible, cell
interactions and consolidation could result in some upscale
development. Regardless, this initial activity will pose an
all-hazards severe risk.

Additional supercells are likely to develop along the surface
dryline from central/eastern KS/OK where strong heating along/to the
west of the boundary is expected. Convergence along the dryline is
not forecast to be overly strong as low-level flow appears to remain
more southerly rather than southeasterly given a lack of stronger
surface cyclogenesis. This could result in a messy storm mode due to
storm interactions. Nevertheless, strong instability, very steep
lapse rates, and a favorably sheared environment will support
significant severe storms pose an all-hazards severe risk.  With
time and an increasing low-level jet, one or more linear bands may
develop across eastern KS/OK and move into MO/AR during the
nighttime hours. A corridor of greater risk potential is possible
somewhere across central/eastern OK/KS but uncertainty remains too
great at this time for a categorical outlook upgrade. 

...Middle TN into parts of SC...

An upper ridge is forecast to be centered over the OH/TN Valley and
Gulf Coast region, with modest northwesterly flow aloft spreading
over the Southeast. Most guidance depicts a remnant MCV migrating
through the northwest flow amid a corridor of strong instability.
Deep-layer flow will be unidirectional, but speed shear will produce
long/straight hodographs, with effective shear magnitudes around
25-35 kt. Modest midlevel lapse rates nearing 7 C/km, and strong
surface heating leading to steep low-level lapse rates. Isolated
large hail and strong/damaging gusts will be possible as convection
develops southeast across the region through the afternoon.

AND CENTRAL KANSAS INTO FAR NORTHWEST OKLAHOMA...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM EASTERN
MISSISSIPPI...CENTRAL ALABAMA...AND SOUTHERN GEORGIA...

CORRECTED FOR THUNDER LINE IN MAINE

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms capable of all severe hazards are expected this
afternoon and evening across portions of the central and southern
Plains.  Several strong to intense tornadoes are possible.

...KS/OK...
A large upper trough continues to deepen over the western US, with a
band of 60-70 knot southwesterly mid-level flow extending across NM
into western KS/OK.  The surface dryline will mix eastward into
western KS and along the TX/OK border by mid-afternoon, with the air
mass to the east becoming extremely unstable with dewpoints in the
upper 60s and MLCAPE values over 4000 J/kg.  Strong
southerly/southeasterly low-level winds throughout the warm sector
will provide a conditionally favorable environment for intense
supercells capable of very large hail, damaging winds, and
tornadoes.  However, morning model guidance continues to show
diverse solutions regarding coverage of convection later today.  

The area of greatest confidence in storm development and intensity
will be near the warm front/dryline triple point over south-central
KS.  Discrete supercell development appears likely here, with
forecast soundings showing favorable hodograph structures to promote
a risk of strong tornadoes.  The MDT risk has been extending
slightly eastward along the warm front.  Farther south along the
dryline in western OK, confidence in initiation is lower.  However,
any storm that can form will be capable of all hazards.

...Western North TX...
Another region of higher confidence in convective initiation will be
over western north TX along the dryline.  Hot surface temperatures
in vicinity of a dryline bulge will aid in storm development.  These
storms will likely expand eastward and into southwest OK through the
evening, with very large hail and damaging winds possible.

...MS/AL/GA...
A narrow corridor of SLGT risk has been added for this afternoon
from eastern MS across central AL and southern GA.  Multiple MCSs
are ongoing in this corridor, with associated outflow boundaries
present.  These boundaries may be the focus for further development
this afternoon, with sufficient CAPE/shear combinations to pose a
risk of damaging winds in the strongest cells.

1120 AM CDT Sun May 18 2025

Valid 181700Z - 191200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN
NEW MEXICO INTO FAR WEST TEXAS...

The previous forecast remains largely on track. Visible satellite
depicts clearing skies across the southern High Plains, supporting
robust boundary-layer mixing. Surface observations show evidence of
a developing dryline over the TX Panhandle, with 10-20 mph sustained
southwesterly surface winds amid 10-30 percent RH in the
post-dryline environment. Some surface observations across southern
New Mexico already depict Critical meteorological conditions (i.e.
single-digit RH coinciding with sustained winds well over 20 mph).
With continued boundary-layer heating/mixing, these Critical
conditions should become common across most of the southern High
Plains behind the dryline, in agreement with the latest guidance
consensus. However, Critical highlights remain only where fuels are
highly receptive to wildfire-spread potential.

Guidance consensus also still shows the potential for 15-20 mph
sustained northwesterly surface winds coinciding with 15-25 percent
RH across portions of the California Valley region later this
afternoon, where Elevated highlights remain in place.

..Squitieri.. 05/18/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0110 AM CDT Sun May 18 2025/

...Synopsis...
As a mid-level shortwave trough progresses from the Four Corners to
the southern High Plains, and a surface lee cyclone deepens
throughout the morning and afternoon, Critical fire-weather
conditions are anticipated across much of southern New Mexico.
Further west, mid-level northerly flow on the western side of the
trough is expected to bring Elevated fire-weather conditions to the
Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys.

...Southern New Mexico...
Deep boundary-layer mixing behind a sharpening dryline, along with a
deepening surface cyclone and associated gradient wind response,
will be responsible for widespread Critical fire-weather conditions
this afternoon. Sustained winds of 25 MPH and relative humidity
below 10%, along with highly receptive fuels, will result in
conditions that support rapid wildfire ignition and spread. Some
downslope winds in southern and eastern New Mexico may even locally
reach Extremely Critical criteria, with sustained winds exceeding 30
MPH. However, such conditions appear to be too localized for larger
highlights at this time. Additionally, the Critical meteorological
conditions will exist well into the Texas Panhandle and portions of
southern Kansas -- but ERC fuels guidance shows fuels are not quite
as receptive, warranting only Elevated highlights. 

...Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys...
Deep boundary-layer mixing beneath modest mid-level northerly flow
will result in dry and windy conditions across much of the interior
California valleys. Winds of 15 MPH and relative humidity at or
below 15% are expected. Fuels appear more marginal, but there is
some signal for fuel receptiveness, warranting at least Elevated
highlights.

0656 AM CDT Sun May 18 2025

Areas affected...central Arkansas and northern Mississippi

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 284...

Valid 181156Z - 181400Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 284
continues.

SUMMARY...Long-lived cluster of thunderstorms, with a history of
producing wind damage, continues to move through central Arkansas.
The overall environment should continue to support a severe threat
ahead of this MCS through at least mid morning.

DISCUSSION...Long-lived linear MCS, with a history of producing wind
damage, continues to move east-southeast through much of Arkansas
this morning. This MCS is moving along a west-northwest to
east-southeast CAPE gradient stretching from northeast Oklahoma into
southern Georgia and is following a similar path as to an earlier
MCS from last evening into earlier this morning. 

The overall large-scale environment will continue to support
maintenance of this MCS as the MCS has access to MUCAPE greater than
2000 J/kg and effective shear around 50 knots. The organization of
the MCS, the overall favorable environment,and knowledge that the
earlier MCS traversed a similar environment and is continuing
through Alabama supports the severe threat through the morning. A
downstream watch may become necessary for portions of far eastern
Arkansas and northern Mississippi as the MCS approaches the edge of
Severe Thunderstorm Watch #284.

Mesoscale Discussion 0853
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0640 AM CDT Sun May 18 2025

Areas affected...Central Alabama and far west-central Georgia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 181140Z - 181245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...A thunderstorm cluster moving across central Alabama will
pose a threat for isolated large hail and wind damage in the near
term. Longer term evolution of this cluster is less certain, but the
area will continue to be monitored for potential watch issuance.

DISCUSSION...Long-lived cluster of thunderstorms continues to move
across central Alabama this morning along the instability gradient.
The strongest of these thunderstorms (located across eastern
Tuscaloosa County) appears to have increased in intensity over the
last hour and has even developed a rear-inflow jet (RIJ) --
suggested by radar reflectivity structure and an increase in
rear-to-front wind speeds. This will pose a damaging wind threat in
the short term.

Additionally, overall reflectivity structure of the thunderstorm
complex suggests the development of a mesoscale convective vortex.
Should this be the case, an increase in updraft intensity would be
expected in the near term owing to increasing convergence and
stronger deep-layer shear. MUCAPE is around 1000 J/kg and deep-layer
shear around 50 knots across the thunderstorm cluster now, but drops
off to around 1000 J/kg and 30-40 knots as the cluster approaches
western Georgia.

As the thunderstorms move east, the lack of clarity of the MCV
evolution and a slightly less favorable environment results in
uncertainty as to whether a severe thunderstorm watch will be needed
downstream. Conditions will continue to be monitored for potential
watch issuance.

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Eastern Alabama
  North-Central Georgia

* Effective this Sunday morning and afternoon from 815 AM until
  100 PM EDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...A fast-moving cluster of strong to severe thunderstorms
will likely continue eastward from eastern Alabama into Georgia this
morning.  Scattered damaging gusts (55-70 mph) will be the primary
severe hazard, but large hail may accompany the stronger
thunderstorms as well.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 45
statute miles north and south of a line from 25 miles south of
Anniston AL to 45 miles northeast of Macon GA. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU5).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 284...

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
1.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
27045.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0345 AM CDT Sun May 18 2025

Valid 211200Z - 261200Z

...DISCUSSION...
A few strong to isolated severe storms are possible in the eastern
Carolinas on Wednesday as a mid-level trough shifts east across the
eastern CONUS. It is unclear whether there will be substantial time
for destabilization before the surface low/front moves into the
Atlantic Ocean. Therefore, no probabilities are necessary for
Wednesday/D4 at this time.

Once this front moves offshore, a more benign period of severe
storms appears likely. The cold front will move south near the Gulf
Coast and into Florida with mostly sub 60s dewpoints across the
Eastern CONUS in its wake. Farther west the front is expected to
stall across Texas with low-level flow expected to advect moisture
westward to the High Plains on Thursday/D5.

Sufficient moisture should be in place by D7/Saturday across the
Plains. Therefore, some greater severe weather potential will likely
return by next weekend. However, uncertainty currently remains high
regarding the amplitude of the mid-level ridging and the location of
surface boundaries. Therefore, no probabilities have been introduced
at this time.

Mesoscale Discussion 0842
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0336 PM CDT Sat May 17 2025

Areas affected...Upstate New York into Vermont and far western
Massachusetts

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 277...

Valid 172036Z - 172230Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 277
continues.

SUMMARY...Scattered strong to severe storms persist from Upstate New
York into Vermont. Strong gusts, marginal hail, and a brief tornado
remain possible.

DISCUSSION...Storms appear to be producing strong outflow/gusts as
well as hail up to severe limits over northern NY and VT. The area
has destabilized as lapse rates continue to steepen aloft, now with
around 1000 J/kg MLCAPE. However, satellite imagery shows the
effects of midlevel subsidence father south into PA, with
flat/"pancake" cumulus presentation.

Objective analysis does indicate relatively large 0-1 SRH over
VT/MA/NH, with values of 100-150 m2/s2. In addition, early day
clouds have moved out, allowing heating. As such, this general zone
could support a brief tornado as storms approach from the west later
this afternoon.

Mesoscale Discussion 0841
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0312 PM CDT Sat May 17 2025

Areas affected...Southern Arkansas into northeast Louisiana

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 172012Z - 172215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...An isolated thunderstorm or two may pose a large
hail/damaging wind threat through late afternoon. Watch issuance is
not expected.

DISCUSSION...GOES 1-minute imagery shows building cumulus along a
northward advancing warm front across north/northeastern LA.
Multiple weak attempts at convective initiation have been noted over
the past 20 minutes, but it remains unclear if sustained deep
convection will become established. Locally enhanced convergence
associated with the outflow of a decaying supercell to the southeast
may promote adequate ascent for a storm or two within the next
couple of hours. If a storm can become established, the convective
environment (characterized by 2500-3000 J/kg MLCAPE and 50 knots of
effective shear) would support supercellular storm modes (this was
demonstrated by a prior cell that produced 2.5 inch hail near
Jackson, MS). Storm propagation to the southeast along the warm
front/outflow boundary is likely with the potential for severe hail
(possibly as large as 2.5 inches) and damaging gusts. Given the
localized nature of this threat, watch issuance is not anticipated.

  Western and Southern Oklahoma
  Northwest Texas

* Effective this Saturday afternoon and evening from 240 PM until
  1000 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A couple tornadoes possible
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 3
    inches in diameter likely
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph likely

SUMMARY...Widely scattered supercell thunderstorms are expected to
develop this afternoon in a very moist and unstable air mass.  Very
large hail and damaging winds may occur in these storms.  A warm
front draped across Oklahoma may provide sufficient low-level shear
for a few tornadoes as well.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 60 statute miles
north and south of a line from 45 miles west northwest of Altus OK
to 35 miles east southeast of Mcalester OK. For a complete depiction
of the watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS
WOU9).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 277...WW 278...

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 3 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 60 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 550. Mean
storm motion vector 25030.

Mesoscale Discussion 0836
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0636 AM CDT Sat May 17 2025

Areas affected...Upstate New York and northern Vermont

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 171136Z - 171400Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms will continue moving northeast this morning.
Additional thunderstorms will develop later this morning and
afternoon and a watch may eventually be needed.

DISCUSSION...As a strong mid-level low slowly moves east across the
Great Lakes today, multiple rounds of thunderstorms are anticipated
across upstate New York, Vermont, and New Hampshire. These storms
will be aided by increasing large-scale forcing from a number of
sources: increasing upper-level divergence, lobes of positive
vorticity advection, and the left exit region of a mid-level jet. 

As diurnal heating increases this morning, cold mid-level
temperatures will overspread the region. This, coupled with surface
dewpoints ranging from the mid 50Fs to mid 60Fs will result in a
largely unstable, uncapped environment, primed for thunderstorm
development in association with one of the myriad of large-scale
forcing mechanisms. 

One such mechanism is already producing thunderstorms across far
eastern portions of Lake Ontario. These thunderstorms should
continue to rapidly move northeast into northern Vermont this
morning. These thunderstorms will be capable of producing gusty
winds and small hail. 

The likelihood for a watch in the short-term is relatively low.
However, as instability increases, and more widespread forcing for
ascent moves into the area, a watch or watches may be needed across
portions of the area by midday into early afternoon.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0748 AM CDT Sat May 17 2025

Valid 171300Z - 181200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS NORTH
TEXAS AND SOUTHERN OKLAHOMA...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PORTIONS OF
UPSTATE NEW YORK AND WESTERN NEW ENGLAND...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms producing large to very large hail, damaging
gusts and a couple of tornadoes are expected across the southern
Plains. Additional severe storms are possible across the Northeast.

...Southern Plains Region...
Water vapor imagery depicts a pronounced southern stream upper-level
trough over the Baja Peninsula this morning, with evidence of a lead
impulse approaching southwest TX. This leading impulse will
contribute to ascent in the vicinity of a sharpening dryline across
Western North Texas/Oklahoma by early afternoon. To the east of the
dryline, extreme instability (MLCAPE in excess of 4000 J/kg) is
expected to develop given the moist low-level air mass and
relatively cool mid-level thermal profiles. With negligible CINH by
early/mid afternoon, thunderstorms are expected to develop along the
dryline and move east/northeast into North Texas and southern
Oklahoma. Supercells will be the dominant mode initially, with a
risk for very large hail (in excess of 3.5 inches), and damaging
gusts. Although low-level shear is not especially strong, some
tornado risk will exist given the magnitude of instability and
potential for storm-scale interactions. Eventual upscale growth into
a severe MCS is expected as storms continue to move across North
TX/southern OK this evening. Severe wind probabilities have been
increased across the Enhanced Risk area for the expectation of a
more concentrated corridor of damaging wind potential.

Across central/northwest OK, a narrowing plume of instability will
be present east of the dryline and south of an east-west oriented
frontal boundary.  Within this moist sector, strong to extreme
instability and around 50 kts of deep-layer shear will support at
least isolated supercell storm development this afternoon over
central OK. Very large hail (3 inches or greater) will be possible,
in addition to damaging gusts. Tornado risk will be dependent on
storm interactions. Thunderstorm development over northwest OK is
more uncertain, however should a storm develop a supercell mode will
be favored with all hazards possible. 

...Northeast...
Strong mid-level height falls will spread across much of the
northeastern U.S. today in response to the approaching Great Lakes
upper low. Large-scale ascent will increase with as the left-exit
region of the 500mb jet translates across PA. Scattered
thunderstorms, including supercells, are expected to develop
along/ahead of the synoptic cold front across upstate NY, with
subsequent movement expected into western New England. Multiple
rounds of thunderstorms are likely, with severe hail and winds as
the primary risks. A tornado or two cannot be ruled out with any
stronger and semi-discrete supercell. Please refer to Mesoscale
Discussion 836 for additional details on short-term expectations.

...Northern Utah Vicinity...
A Marginal Risk has been introduced across northern UT and vicinity
given expected higher concentration of storms within a deeply-mixed
boundary layer. Strong/severe gusts will be the primary severe risk.

...Lower Mississippi Valley/Southeast...
Thunderstorms continue from central MS into the western Carolinas at
13z, with occasional pulses of strong/severe cells. Isolated
stronger storms will remain possible as diurnal
heating/destabilization takes place in the presence of ample shear
for organized storms. However, with the line of convection oriented
generally parallel to the shear vector, any severe risk should be
isolated. Strong gusts will be the primary hazard.

Mesoscale Discussion 0820
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0314 PM CDT Fri May 16 2025

Areas affected...western/central PA to northern VA

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 263...

Valid 162014Z - 162215Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 263
continues.

SUMMARY...A mix of damaging winds and severe hail remains possible
through early evening from western to central Pennsylvania southward
into northern Virginia. A corridor of greater damaging wind
potential is apparent in central Maryland, the District of Columbia,
and far northern Virginia.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorm coverage has steadily increased ahead of a
minor MCV, and separately along a wavy outflow boundary. Measured
strong to severe wind gusts have occurred along the outflow
associated with the MCV. Very strong mid-level winds persist in the
wake of this MCV, as sampled by recent RLX VWP data. With surface
temperatures in the mid to upper 80s ahead of this outflow, yielding
peak MLCAPE of 2000-2500 J/kg, damaging wind swaths are most
probable into central MD to far northern VA. Farther north,
convection has largely struggled, outside of a slow-moving supercell
along the separate outflow boundary in south-central PA. Mixed
severe hail and damaging wind will remain possible here, amid weak
low-level shear/SRH.

Mesoscale Discussion 0819
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0310 PM CDT Fri May 16 2025

Areas affected...much of northeast Texas into much of southern
Arkansas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 162010Z - 162215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered severe storms appear likely later this
afternoon, with large hail and locally damaging gusts the most
likely threats.

DISCUSSION...The primary surface front currently extends from near
Ft. Smith AR southwestward into parts of North Texas, with very
strong instability in place. A special 19Z FWD sounding shows MLCAPE
of 3250 J/kg, along with 0-6 km shear around 55 kt. 

Weak convergence along the front and continued heating should result
in sporadic storm development along this boundary, and the
environment will supercells producing very large hail. Visible
imagery shows towering CU along portions of the front, and
initiation appears likely in the next couple hours.

Mesoscale Discussion 0818
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0230 PM CDT Fri May 16 2025

Areas affected...northeast WI into central Upper MI

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 161930Z - 162130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated severe gusts with small to marginally severe hail
will be possible into early evening with high-based thunderstorms
advancing north-northeast from northeast Wisconsin into central
Upper Michigan.

DISCUSSION...Scattered high-based thunderstorms have developed
downstream of the vertically stacked cyclone over northern MN.
Despite surface dew points only in the 40s to low 50s, storm
development has been sustained where temperatures warmed into the
low to mid 80s. This has yielded a deep inverted-v thermodynamic
profile. Shear within the buoyancy layer appears weak, but the steep
lapse rates through the troposphere will foster small to marginally
severe hail cores. This should enhance downdrafts and could support
strong to severe microbursts as convection spreads northeast through
the rest of the afternoon.

Mesoscale Discussion 0817
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0208 PM CDT Fri May 16 2025

Areas affected...northern Arkansas...eastern Missouri...southern
Illinois...far western Kentucky

Concerning...Tornado Watch 262...

Valid 161908Z - 162115Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 262 continues.

SUMMARY...A threat of very large hail and occasional tornadoes
persists across the watch area, and will eventually spread east into
southern Illinois and western Kentucky. Another watch will likely be
needed soon.

DISCUSSION...A rash of supercells is moving rapidly from
south-central into eastern MO, with isolated cells extending into
northern AR. These storms are ahead of a cold front/dryline where
low-level winds are veering to westerly. Meanwhile, the warm front
is now close to St. Louis, with southerly winds bringing 68+
dewpoints northward into the area.

The combination of cool midlevel temperatures and the ample boundary
layer moisture is resulting in MLCAPE values approaching 4000 J/kg.
This, in combination with effective deep-layer shear over 60 kt, is
providing an extremely favorable environment for very large hail of
3-4" diameter. 

In addition, 0-1 SRH remains in the 150-200 m2/s2 range, which is
sufficient for a tornado risk. In the near term, the greatest
tornado risk is over southeast MO, and will eventually shift into
far southern IL and western KY.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 262
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1155 AM CDT Fri May 16 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Northern Arkansas
  Southwestern Illinois
  Central and Eastern Missouri
  Far Eastern Oklahoma

* Effective this Friday morning and evening from 1155 AM until
  700 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A few tornadoes likely with a couple intense tornadoes possible
  Widespread large hail and scattered very large hail events to 4
    inches in diameter likely
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph likely

SUMMARY...The airmass across the region continues to destabilize
amid strong low-level moisture advection and daytime heating. Robust
thunderstorm development is anticipated over the next few hours as
an approaching cold front interacts with this strong buoyant
airmass. Strong vertical shear is also in place, supporting
supercells as the primary storm mode. All severe hazards are
possible with these supercells, including very large hail up to 4"
in diameter and strong tornadoes.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 80 statute miles
east and west of a line from 70 miles south of Harrison AR to 35
miles north northwest of Saint Louis MO. For a complete depiction of
the watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS
WOU2).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

0740 AM CDT Fri May 16 2025

Areas affected...northeast AR into central KY

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 259...

Valid 161240Z - 161445Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 259
continues.

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm cluster may continue to pose a risk for hail
and sporadic strong gusts this morning. Local watch extension may be
needed for portions of Severe Thunderstorm Watch 259.

DISCUSSION...Strong to severe thunderstorms continue from northeast
AR into central KY this morning. While previously a new watch was
considered, given some weakening in the clusters across central KY,
local watch extensions may be more appropriate as uncertainty in
downstream evolution has increased. Nevertheless, a favorable
environment will persist, supporting a continued large hail risk in
the short term. If further upscale growth occurs with ongoing
clusters, a risk for damaging gust potential could increase later
this morning or toward midday downstream from WW 259. Local watch
extensions for 1-2 hours may be need if current trends persist for
another 30-60 minutes.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0635 AM CDT Fri May 16 2025

Areas affected...northeast AR/southeast MO into parts of KY/TN...WV
and western VA

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 259...

Valid 161135Z - 161330Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 259
continues.

SUMMARY...Severe thunderstorms posing a risk for large to very large
hail will persist across Severe Thunderstorm Watch 259. This
activity may maintain severity downstream into eastern Kentucky and
portions of West Virginia and western Virginia. A new watch may be
needed to replace WW 259 and to expand downstream.

DISCUSSION...Scattered severe thunderstorm clusters are ongoing this
morning from northeast AR into central KY. This activity is
occurring in a warm advection regime and on the fringes of an 850 mb
southwesterly low-level jet. While some inhibition is present in the
low-levels given the nocturnally cooled boundary layer, MUCAPE from
1000-2000 J/kg is in place amid a moist airmass. Elongated/straight
supercell profiles and cool temperatures aloft also are present.
Thus, a large hail threat will accompany any more discrete
convection. 

Recent radar trends suggest clustering may be underway near the MO
Bootheel and into western KY. If this continues, convection could
develop into a small MCS and move across KY toward WV/VA, posing a
risk for strong/severe wind gusts as well as the downstream airmass
destabilizes and inhibition erodes later this morning as diurnal
heating ensues. 

An isolated cell also is approaching the edge of WW 259 across
central KY and a downstream watch and/or larger watch replacement
may be needed soon.

SUMMARY...Large to very large hail and severe winds will be possible
with supercells that can develop later this afternoon. Watch timing
is uncertain but is possible later this afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Cumulus are developing along an eastward moving dryline
near the Mississippi River. Ahead of this boundary, a strongly
unstable airmass is in place (low 90s F temperatures and mid 60s to
low 70s F dewpoints). With the strongest mid-level ascent to the
northwest of the region, timing of storm initiation as well as storm
coverage are uncertain. However, given the lack of MLCIN, a isolated
to widely scattered development appears possible later this
afternoon. 45-55 kts of effective shear will support supercells. The
primary hazards will be large to very large hail and severe winds.
The tornado threat is expected to be less than farther north given
the slightly veered low-level winds and more sizable
temperature/dewpoint spreads at the surface.

Mesoscale Discussion 0793
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0307 PM CDT Thu May 15 2025

Areas affected...portions of central Arkansas into western
Tennessee...far southeast Missouri...far southwestern Kentucky

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 252...

Valid 152007Z - 152130Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 252
continues.

SUMMARY...Ongoing storms may still reach severe limits, with
damaging gusts and large hail the main concerns. These storms may
persist downstream of Severe Thunderstorm Watch 252, so a local
extension of the ongoing watch, or the issuance of a new downstream
Severe Thunderstorm Watch, may be needed.

DISCUSSION...Strong thunderstorms (still possibly elevated) continue
across AR amid a pronounced EML atop rich low-level moisture and
strong deep-layer shear. As such, any storm cores that can intensify
will continue to pose at least a severe hail threat. Severe gusts
are also possible if ongoing storms can become surface based by
either rooting into the boundary layer, or establishing a strong
cold pool, which could lift surface-based parcels to the LFC along
the cold pool leading edge. It remains uncertain if these storms
have peaked in intensity or if greater severe potential exists
downstream. As such, an eastward extension of the ongoing Severe
Thunderstorm Watch, or the issuance of a new watch, may be needed
pending favorable convective trends.

0300 PM CDT Thu May 15 2025

Areas affected...Portions of northwest Wisconsin

Concerning...Tornado Watch 251...

Valid 152000Z - 152130Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 251 continues.

SUMMARY...Tornado potential, including a strong tornado, will shift
into portions of northwest Wisconsin over the next 1-2 hours.

DISCUSSION...A broken line of supercells continues north and east.
These storms will move across the River and into northwest Wisconsin
shortly. Temperatures have risen into low 80s F with dewpoints
remaining near 64 F. Given the storm mode, low-level thermodynamics,
and backed surface winds, this area will be the primary focus for
tornado potential over the next 1-2 hours. Storms have remained in
close proximity to one another, but still sufficiently discrete that
overall inflow quality remains favorable for low-level mesocyclone
intensification. With objective mesoanalysis showing STP of 2-3, a
strong tornado remains possible.

Mesoscale Discussion 0791
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0214 PM CDT Thu May 15 2025

Areas affected...Parts of southern Wisconsin into northern Illinois

Concerning...Severe potential...Tornado Watch likely 

Valid 151914Z - 152115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...A tornado watch will likely be needed this afternoon.
Supercells capable of all severe hazards are expected within the
next few hours.

DISCUSSION...Cumulus continue to deepen both along a dryline and an
area of confluence within the Mississippi Valley. Whether storms
develop within the confluence or when the dryline reaches the
Mississippi River remains a question. 40-50 kts of effective shear
across these surface convergence zones will favor supercells as
storms develop. Large to very large hail will be a concern as well
as severe wind gusts. The 18Z DVN sounding sampled very steep
mid-level lapse rates and a long hodograph. Tornado potential will
also be present. Surface temperature/dewpoint spreads are near 20 F,
but low-level shear and a supercellular mode will favor low-level
rotation. The time frame of greater tornado potential will likely be
22-00Z when the low-level jet increases in southern Wisconsin.

Mesoscale Discussion 0785
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0723 AM CDT Thu May 15 2025

Areas affected...Southeast SD...southern MN...extreme northeast
NE/northwest IA

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 151223Z - 151400Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...A threat for strong to isolated severe storms may continue
through the morning.

DISCUSSION...A long-lived storm cluster is ongoing this morning
across south-central MN. This system has persisted longer than most
guidance would suggest, and is likely being aided by persistent
moisture transport associated with a strong low-level jet. While
this system remains relatively disorganized with outflow tending to
outpace the deeper convection, localized strong wind gusts and hail
will be possible, especially where new updrafts develop and briefly
intensify behind the outflow. 

To the southwest, renewed storm development is underway across
southeast SD and far northeast NE, immediately in advance of a
compact but vigorous midlevel shortwave trough moving across
north-central NE/south-central SD. Rather strong low-level
southeasterly flow will maintain moisture transport into the region
through the morning ahead of a cold front, and development of
somewhat more organized convection will be possible with time. In
the short term, convection will tend to be somewhat elevated, but
could become rooted closer to the surface later this morning,
especially with southeast extent. Some hail and strong-gust
potential could evolve if convection is able to deepen and intensify
within this regime.  

With the threat expected to remain rather isolated over the next 1-2
hours, short-term watch issuance is considered unlikely. Trends will
continue to be monitored for intensification with time this morning.

Mesoscale Discussion 0778
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0307 PM CDT Wed May 14 2025

Areas affected...Southwest into central Nebraska

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 142007Z - 142200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Large/very-large hail and severe winds will be the primary
threats as storms develop and mature this afternoon and evening.
Supercells on the southern end of the activity may have slightly
higher associated tornado threat. A watch is likely late this
afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Dewpoints have held in the low 60s F in central
Nebraska this afternoon. Cumulus towers and recent lightning have
been observed in Cherry County in the last hour along a surface
boundary. Water vapor imagery shows ascent increasing in Colorado as
a shortwave trough continues to pivot northeastward. This ascent
should reach western/southwestern Nebraska later this afternoon. In
the near term, additional storms appear probable as
heating/convergence continue along the boundary. The eastern
boundary is the most likely zone for initiation, though additional
storms could form on the weaker boundary to the west. With
deep-layer shear having a more westerly component this far south,
which should be maintained/modestly increase as the trough ejects
this evening, a mixed mode of linear segments and supercells can be
expected. Supercells will be favored with southern extent.

Modestly steep mid-level lapse rates and increasing shear by the
evening will support organized storms capable of large/very-large
hail (particularly supercells) and severe winds. While the low-level
jet response this evening is not expected to be overly strong, a
supercell along the southern flank of the activity may have slightly
higher tornado potential.

A watch is likely by late afternoon. Timing of watch issuance is
somewhat uncertain given greater storm coverage may wait until
greater mid-level ascent arrives by 22-00Z.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 247
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
350 PM CDT Wed May 14 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Western and Central Nebraska
  South-Central and Central South Dakota

* Effective this Wednesday afternoon and evening from 350 PM
  until 1100 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 75
    mph possible
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 3
    inches in diameter possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms should continue to gradually increase in
coverage and intensity this afternoon and evening. Supercells should
pose a threat for large to very large hail potentially up to 2-3
inches in diameter, especially across parts of western into central
Nebraska. Otherwise, scattered severe wind gusts may occur with any
clusters that eventually form. A tornado or two also appears
possible, mainly this evening.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 45
statute miles east and west of a line from 35 miles north of Pierre
SD to 25 miles east southeast of Imperial NE. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU7).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
3 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 65 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
20030.

Mesoscale Discussion 0774
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0746 AM CDT Tue May 13 2025

Areas affected...Parts of eastern NC into southeast VA

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 131246Z - 131445Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...A localized brief-tornado and wind-damage threat may
persist through the morning.

DISCUSSION...Extensive convection is ongoing this morning across
eastern NC into southeast VA. Weak instability (MLCAPE generally 500
J/kg or less) is limiting updraft intensity, with lightning
primarily confined to somewhat deeper convection near the NC coast.
However, to the east of the slow-moving midlevel cyclone centered
over western TN/KY, rather strong low-level flow continues to be
noted on the KMHX and KAKQ VWPs, supporting effective SRH of 150-200
m2/s2. Small cells with occasional rotation have persisted from
northeast NC into far southeast VA, and some localized threat for a
brief tornado and wind damage could persist through the morning with
these smaller cells. 

Farther south, an extensive convective cluster is ongoing off the NC
coast, with some evidence of an MCV south of Morehead City. This
cluster could spread northward toward the immediate coast and Outer
Banks with time, with embedded cells potentially posing a threat of
strong gusts and a brief tornado, especially where surface dewpoints
remain near 70 F this morning.

0139 PM CDT Sun May 11 2025

Areas affected...eastern Idaho into western Wyoming and southwest
Montana

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 111839Z - 112115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Storms should gradually increase in coverage and intensity
from eastern Idaho into southwest Montana, with both hail and gust
potential.

DISCUSSION...A line of convection continue to increase in intensity
over the upper Snake River Plain, with both strong heating and
low-level warm advection ahead of it. Continued steepening of
deep-layer lapse rates as the upper trough moves in the from the
west and more heating should support further strengthening of this
convection. Strong deep-layer shear will favor hail production with
these storms over eastern ID. A brief/weak tornado cannot be ruled
out with the stronger cells this afternoon, as low-level stretching
is maximized.

Farther north toward the Bitterroots, stronger cooling aloft is
occurring, and areas of heating persist ahead of this activity as
well. Long hodographs and cold midlevel temperatures will favor hail
with these storms through the day.

0221 PM CDT Sun May 11 2025

Areas affected...central Florida northward toward southeast Georgia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 111921Z - 112145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Storms are forecast to increase in coverage throughout the
afternoon from the central Florida Peninsula into northeast Florida
and southeast Georgia.

DISCUSSION...Storms are currently increasing east of Tampa to west
of Okeechobee where strong heating has led to strong instability.
The southerly flow regime should support a north/northeast movement
to this development, affecting the remainder of central into
northeastern Florida. Breaks in the clouds in those downstream areas
are developing, and this should further increase instability.
Although temperatures aloft are not as cool as previous days, MUCAPE
over 2000 J/kg and deep-layer shear of 35-40 kt will support
cellular storm mode with sporadic hail > 1.00" expected. Locally
strong to damaging gusts cannot be ruled out as well, especially
with any merging outflows.

Mesoscale Discussion 0766
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0149 PM CDT Sun May 11 2025

Areas affected...Portions of southeast Georgia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 111849Z - 112045Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...A locally greater risk for damaging winds and perhaps a
tornado is evident in southeast Georgia near a local warm front
feature.

DISCUSSION...A small corridor in southeast Georgia has heated into
the low 80s F. A few weak discrete cells exist near the
Georgia/South Carolina state line. One cell has recently intensified
and shown signs of low-level rotation. The localized warm front
feature will promote at least marginal potential for a brief tornado
with southeasterly winds near the boundary. Nearby KCLX radar
accordingly shows modest 0-1 km SRH. Over the next hour or two this
environment will support a locally greater risk for damaging winds
and perhaps a tornado. The discrete cells will have the greatest
potential, but stronger updrafts within the linear segment farther
southwest could also acquire low-level rotation as well.

Mesoscale Discussion 0764
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0130 PM CDT Sun May 11 2025

Areas affected...Salt Lake Vicinity

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 111830Z - 112030Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Severe wind gusts will be possible this afternoon with
high-based showers and embedded thunderstorms.

DISCUSSION...With temperatures rising into the low/mid 80s F in the
vicinity of Salt Lake, high-based showers and isolated thunderstorms
have deepened over the last hour. A few of these storms have
produced 58-63 mph measured gusts in Tooele/Salt Lake Counties.
While low-level wind fields are not overly strong, the 9.2 C/km
700-500 mb lapse rate observed in this mornings 12Z SLC sounding,
coupled with steep low-level lapse rates and high surface dewpoint
depressions, will continue to support strong diabatically driven
downdrafts. Severe wind gusts will remain possible through the
afternoon in association with this weak, disorganized convection.
