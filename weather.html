Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0738 AM CDT Wed Aug 13 2025

Valid 131300Z - 141200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
SOUTH DAKOTA AND NORTH-CENTRAL NEBRASKA...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe wind gusts and isolated large hail may occur across
parts of the northern/central Plains this evening and overnight.
Thunderstorms across portions of the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic may
produce occasional damaging winds this afternoon.

...Northern/Central Plains...
The primary upper trough will remain over western/central Canada
today, with quasi-zonal westerly mid-level flow continuing over much
of the northern Rockies/Plains through the period. A
subtle/low-amplitude shortwave trough over parts of ID/western MT
this morning associated with ongoing weak convection is forecast to
advance eastward towards eastern MT/WY and the western Dakotas by
early this evening. Gradually warming low/mid-level temperatures and
a stout cap will likely hinder surface-based convective development
across much of the northern/central Plains until mid to late
afternoon at the earliest. Still, the modest large-scale ascent
associated with the approaching shortwave trough may be sufficient
in tandem with robust daytime heating and localized orographic
effects near the Black Hills to initiate thunderstorms.

Modest low-level moisture will continue to stream northward today
along/east of a surface lee trough. Initially high-based convection
across the northern/central High Plains could pose an isolated
threat for mainly severe gusts as it continues eastwards towards
greater low-level moisture and MLCAPE. The best potential for a more
focused corridor of severe winds and isolated large hail still
appears generally along/east-southeast of the Black Hills towards
central SD and perhaps north-central NE this evening into the early
overnight hours. Here, moderate instability and deep-layer shear
should overlap with a very well-mixed boundary layer, supporting a
severe wind threat with any cluster that can become established amid
a gradually strengthening low-level jet. Some uncertainty still
remains regarding this potential, however, as low/mid-level
temperatures (around 850-700 mb) are forecast to remain quite warm.

...Northeast/Mid-Atlantic...
The Northeast and portions of the Mid-Atlantic will experience the
glancing influence of upper troughing advancing eastward over
Ontario/Quebec today. A moist low-level airmass is already in place
ahead of a weak surface front extending southwestward from the Great
Lakes into the Midwest. Although lapse rates aloft will remain poor
through the afternoon, diurnal heating ahead of ongoing showers and
thunderstorms this morning should promote weak to locally moderate
instability from New England to parts of the Mid-Atlantic. Generally
modest mid-level flow (around 15-25 kt at 500 mb) should tend to
limit deep-layer shear given weak winds at low levels. Even so,
loosely organized clusters may still pose some threat for isolated
damaging winds this afternoon and early evening as convection
spreads eastward amid a boundary layer characterized by steepened
low-level lapse rates.

Post-Tropical Cyclone Henriette Discussion Number  37
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   EP082025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 PM HST Tue Aug 12 2025
 
Henriette has failed to produce any deep convection near the 
low-level center for about 12 hours. Global models show that 
convection is not expected to return over the low-level center in an 
environment of strong vertical wind shear, dry mid-level air, and 
cooling SSTs along the forecast track. With convection not 
anticipated to return, Henriette is now designated as a 
post-tropical cyclone. A recent scatterometer Metop-B pass at 0717 
UTC showed winds around 35-39 kt, mainly in the eastern semi-circle. 
Using this data, and an assumed weakening trend from the previous 
advisory the intensity is set to 40 kt.
 
The cyclone is moving towards the northwest at 325/17 kt. This 
general motion should continue through Wednesday, with a turn to the 
north, then northeast around a large subtropical ridge as the system 
continues to weaken. The cyclone is forecast to open into a trough 
and dissipate by the end of the week.
 
This is the last advisory for this system. For additional
information on the post-tropical cyclone please see High Seas
Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, under AWIPS header
NFDHSFEPI, WMO header FZPN02 KWBC, and on the web at
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFEPI.php

Valid 161200Z - 211200Z

...DISCUSSION...
During the Saturday/D4 to Sunday/D5 time frame, a weak midlevel wave
may affect the far northern Plains to upper Great Lakes, rounding
the building upper ridge. Meanwhile, a boundary will exist roughly
from ND/MN into MI, with latitudinal uncertainty. A moist air mass
will remain across this zone, with periodic storm complexes
possible. Predictability is low but at least some wind risk may
develop across portions of this zone.

For the rest of the period through at least Wednesday/D8, a large
upper ridge is forecast to build over much of the West/Rockies, with
minimal severe risk.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0202 AM CDT Wed Aug 13 2025

Valid 141200Z - 151200Z

...Synopsis...
Upper-level troughing is expected to persist along the West Coast
through Thursday, which will maintain southwesterly flow over the
southern to central Sierra Nevada. This will maintain a downslope
flow regime across NV and aid in advecting hot/dry air northeastward
into adjacent portions of UT and northwest AZ. Although winds won't
be as strong as today (Wednesday), sustained winds in the mid-teens
will support a broad swath of elevated fire weather conditions over
a region with dry fuels. 

...Dry Thunderstorms... 
A plume of monsoonal moisture sampled by regional 00z soundings will
linger across the eastern Great Basin on Thursday. The combination
of weak synoptic ascent ahead of the upper trough and orographic
lift will promote isolated to scattered thunderstorm development
from northeast NV to western CO by late afternoon. An ensemble of
forecast soundings show good agreement in PWAT values near/below 0.7
inches along with deeply mixed boundary layers and around 100-300
J/kg MLCAPE. This, along with a fairly strong convective signal in
recent CAM guidance, lends high confidence in thunderstorm
development. These thermodynamic conditions are favorable for dry
thunderstorms, which will pose a threat for new lightning starts
given widespread ERC values near/above the 90th percentile.

Tropical Storm Henriette Discussion Number  35
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   EP082025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 AM HST Tue Aug 12 2025
 
 
Henriette continues to weaken.  Convection has become fragmented
over the past few hours with some shallow convection to the east of
the center.  A microwave image from 1740 UTC showed the low-level
eyewall open to the west.  Subjective and objective Dvorak estimates
have generally decreased this cycle and a blend of these data
supports an initial intensity of 55 kt for this advisory.
 
Atmospheric and oceanic conditions are becoming increasingly
hostile.  Sea surface temperatures are expected to drop below 26
degrees C within a few hours.  The ongoing moderate wind shear is
forecast to increase and likely force additional nearby dry air into
the storm's circulation.  Global models suggest that Henriette will
lose all deep convection within 24 hours.  The latest official
intensity forecast now shows the storm becoming a post-tropical
cyclone on Wednesday and a remnant low by Wednesday evening, and
this is in line with the latest consensus aids.
 
Henriette is moving northwestward or 315/15 kt. This general motion
should continue for the next day or so as the storm is steered 
between a mid-level ridge to the northeast and an upper-level low to 
the west. Thereafter, the system should be steered more by the 
low-level flow as it weakens and is expected to decelerate and turn 
north-northwestward and northward. Only minor adjustments have been 
made to the latest NHC track forecast.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR PARTS OF THE
GREAT LAKES REGION...

CORRECTED FOR NDFD

...SUMMARY...
Strong to locally severe thunderstorms are possible over parts of
the Great Lakes/Midwest this afternoon with both damaging winds and
hail possible.

...20Z Update...
Given the weak mid/upper-level flow, the potential for organized
severe wind gusts appears very limited in southeast
Arizona/southwest New Mexico. Steep low-level lapse rates may still
support strong/gusty outflow however. Elsewhere only minor update
the general thunderstorm area were made. See the previous discussion
for additional details.

..Wendt.. 08/12/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1128 AM CDT Tue Aug 12 2025/

...Great Lakes/Midwest...
Midday satellite/radar composite show a weakened thunderstorm band
moving east-northeast across the eastern part of Lower MI.  Surface
analysis indicates rain-cooled air north of a gust front/outflow
that has become draped from southeast Lower MI into the Michiana
region.  Heating south of this boundary has resulted in temperatures
warming through the mid-upper 80s with dewpoints in the lower 70s. 
Additional storms will probably develop along the trailing outflow
and gradually move east-northeast with the mean wind.  Considerably
weaker deep-layer shear is present across the eastern part of the
Corn Belt into the Lower MI vicinity compared to farther north over
the U.P. of MI in closer proximity to a shortwave trough. 
Nonetheless, scattered thunderstorms will gradually develop within a
moist/destabilizing airmass and pose a risk for isolated strong to
perhaps locally severe/damaging gusts this afternoon.

Farther north in WI into the U.P. of MI, a weak cold front will move
into the region later this afternoon.  Model guidance shows widely
scattered storms developing as filtered sunshine leads to a
destabilizing boundary layer.  A few stronger thunderstorms are
possible and could yield a localized risk for marginally severe hail
and damaging gusts during the mid afternoon to early evening period.

...Southeast AZ/southwest NM...
Strong heating should result in widely scattered thunderstorms
developing near terrain-favored areas.  Weak shear will result in
disorganized storms, but the development of very steep surface to
500-mb lapse rates will promote strong evaporative cooling with the
more intense downdrafts.  Isolated severe gusts are possible.

Mesoscale Discussion 1935
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0244 PM CDT Tue Aug 12 2025

Areas affected...southern/eastern IL...western/northern
IN...southwest Lower MI

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 121944Z - 122145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Sporadic strong gusts of 45-60 mph and generally small
hail to 1 inch in diameter will be possible with a broken band of
thunderstorms slowly progressing from Illinois into parts of Indiana
and Lower Michigan. A Severe Thunderstorm Watch is not expected.

DISCUSSION...Along a band of low-level confluence, thunderstorms
have become increasingly numerous from southeast MO into southwest
Lower MI. With surface temperatures of 86-91 F common ahead of this
activity, to the west/north of separate convective outflow in
central IN, potential for sporadic downbursts exists amid weak
lower-level flow. Area VWP data indicate 0-6 km shear around 20 kts
across IL into IN, to around 25 kts in southwest Lower MI. Speed
change with height is largely concentrated in the mid to upper
portion of the buoyancy profile. This suggests small to marginally
severe hail may accompany the strongest updrafts. Loose multicell
clustering may support a localized, marginal severe wind threat.
Based on latest trends, this could be centered in corridors across
the IL/IN/MI border area with ongoing storms near/south of
Chicagoland and separately to the east-northeast of storms near/east
of St. Louis.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM EASTERN NORTH
DAKOTA INTO NORTHWEST MINNESOTA...

...SUMMARY...
Severe storms producing hail and wind are possible mainly from
eastern North Dakota into northwest Minnesota Thursday afternoon and
evening.

...Synopsis and Discussion...
A mature mid-latitude cyclone is forecast to be over central
Alberta/Saskatchewan early Thursday morning before then continuing
gradually eastward and ending the period over the central
Saskatchewan/Manitoba border vicinity. Extensive surface troughing
will precede this system, likely extending from central Saskatchewan
into the central High Plains early Thursday. Primary surface low
associated with this system is forecast to occlude over central
Saskatchewan while a secondary low develops over southern Manitoba
and moves eastward/northeastward into far northwestern Ontario. 

As the secondary surface low moves east, an attendant cold front is
expected to move eastward/southeastward across the Dakotas and
western MN. A very moist airmass, characterized by dewpoints in the
upper 60s/low 70s, will precede this front. This low-level moisture
beneath steep mid-level lapse rates will result in very strong
buoyancy (3000+ J/kg of MLCAPE). Despite ample low-level moisture,
substantial capping will likely persist across much of the northern
Plains given the very warm low/mid-level temperatures (on the order
20 to 25 deg C at 850 mb). Forcing along the front should be strong
enough to overcome this capping across eastern ND, with uncertainty
regarding storm development and coverage increasing with southern
extent across SD. The strong buoyancy and moderate vertical shear
will support large to potentially very large hail with the initially
more cellular storms. Warm and dry low to mid-levels suggest strong
downdrafts are possible with mature storms as well. Upscale growth
is uncertain given the prevailing capping and more limited buoyancy
downstream into MN.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS
SOUTH-CENTRAL SOUTH DAKOTA AND FAR NORTH-CENTRAL NEBRASKA...

...SUMMARY...
The evolution of an organized cluster of thunderstorms accompanied
by strong to severe wind gusts appears possible across parts of
central through eastern South Dakota and far north-central Nebraska
by Wednesday evening.

...Synopsis...
Upper ridging will remain anchored over the Southwest/Four Corners,
with subtropical ridging staying over FL as well. A pair of
low-amplitude shortwave troughs will progress through the westerly
flow north of this ridging. The easternmost wave will likely move
through the Lower OH and TN Valleys while the westernmost wave
progresses along the MT/WY border and through SD. This western wave
is forecast to interact with an unstable airmass to support strong
to severe thunderstorms from eastern WY into the Dakota and NE.
Additional thunderstorms are expected across much of the eastern
CONUS. Storms over the Northeast will be fostered by glancing ascent
attendant to a shortwave trough moving through Quebec while the
previously mentioned shortwave trough moving the TN Valley will
promote development from KY/TN into northern AL/MS. Weak shear
should limit storm organization and strength throughout the eastern
CONUS.

...Eastern WY into the Dakotas and NE...
Elevated showers and thunderstorms will likely be ongoing across
western/central SD Wednesday morning. These storms are generally
expected to be subsevere but will likely persist while gradually
shifting eastward throughout the morning into the afternoon. The
evolution of these storms, and their associated outflow and cloud
cover, introduces some uncertainty into the forecast, particularly
across southeast SD and northeast NE where there is at least a low
probability for reintensification of storms within this cluster. At
this time, given potential capping and varied model solutions
confidence is low in the reintensification scenario. 

A more probable severe potential will result from the thunderstorm
development that initiates farther west across the Black Hills.
Here, increased forcing for ascent attendant to the approaching
shortwave trough amid a warm, deeply mixed, and unstable airmass
will support convective initiation late Wednesday afternoon. These
initially high-based storms will pose a risk for damaging gusts and
isolated hail. Moisture and buoyancy will increase with eastern
extent, which will combine with moderate vertical shear to support a
corridor of higher severe-wind probability across south-central SD
and north-central NE during the late evening. Thereafter, increasing
convective inhibition should result in gradually diminishing storm
intensity. Additionally, elevated thunderstorms with some hail risk
may develop ahead of the convective line across eastern SD during
the late evening and overnight. Here, a strengthening low-level jet
and associated warm-air advection amid steep mid-level lapse rates
and moderate deep-layer shear could support a few storms capable of
large hail.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0128 AM CDT Tue Aug 12 2025/

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns will be focused across parts of central and
eastern Arizona this afternoon, though more local concerns may
emerge across portions of Oregon. 

...Central to eastern Arizona...
A mixture of wet and dry thunderstorms is expected again this
afternoon along the Mogollon Rim. An evening 00z sounding from ABQ
sampled a very deep, dry boundary layer along with steep mid-level
lapse rates and PWAT values near 0.5 inch. This dry, but weakly
buoyant, thermodynamic environment on the northern fringe of the
deeper monsoonal moisture yielded a mix of wet and dry thunderstorms
across the region yesterday. Similar conditions are likely today and
should pose a fire weather concern over areas with receptive fuels.
Dry thunderstorms are possible further east into western NM, but
recent rainfall and improved fuels should mitigate the fire risk.

...Oregon...
A weak mid-level wave is noted in early-morning water-vapor imagery
off the Pacific Northwest coast. This feature will migrate east
through the day and overspread the Cascades through peak heating.
The associated westerly mid-level flow will not be overly strong,
but will still induce a downslope flow regime on the eastern slopes
of the Cascades. Compressional heating/drying, coupled with peak
heating and full insolation, will promote RH reductions between
10-20%. Sustained winds between 10-15 mph appear most probable based
on latest ensemble consensus, but gusts between 20-25 mph
(especially wind-prone locations within the terrain) are possible.

Tropical Storm Henriette Discussion Number  34
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   EP082025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
500 AM HST Tue Aug 12 2025
 
The overall satellite presentation of Henriette has not changed 
much overnight with deep convection over the small inner core of 
the cyclone.  Earlier microwave imagery showed that the eye had 
become less distinct, and the latest subjective and objective 
satellite intensity estimates have begun to decrease.  A blend of 
Dvorak Final-T and CI-numbers from the subjective estimates support 
an initial intensity of 60 kt for this advisory. 

Environmental conditions consisting of SSTs of 26-27 degrees C and 
moderate vertical wind shear suggests that only gradual weakening 
will occur today.  However, the shear is forecast to increase 
significantly overnight and on Wednesday which should result in a 
faster rate of demise.  Simulated satellite imagery from the  
global models show the system decoupling in 24 to 36 hours, and the 
updated forecast calls for Henriette to become post-tropical by 
36 hours, but this could occur a little sooner. The latest NHC 
intensity forecast is near the IVCN multi-model consensus aid, which 
is a little above the HFIP corrected consensus that indicates an 
even faster rate of weakening. 

Henriette is moving northwestward or 315/15 kt, and this general 
motion should continue for another 24 to 36 hours as the system is 
steered between a mid-level ridge to its northeast and an 
upper-level low to the west. As the cyclone weakens and is steered 
more by the low-level low it is expected to decelerate and turn 
north-northwestward and northward. The updated official track 
forecast is essentially an update of the previous advisory and lies 
close to the various consensus aids.

Hurricane Henriette Discussion Number  33
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   EP082025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 PM HST Mon Aug 11 2025
 
Henriette's inner core has deteriorated during the past several
hours.  Microwave overpasses from the Space Operations Command 
(SpOC) WSF-M1 and an ISS TEMPEST-D CubeSat imager revealed a 
collapsed, partial eyewall in the eastern half of the cyclone and 
fragmented curved bands in the southwest and northeast quadrants.  
Subjective intensity estimates from PGTW (17th OWS), PHFO, and SAB, 
a 0710 UTC SATCON analysis of 64 kt and a blend of the UW-CIMSS 
objective intensity techniques yield a lowered initial intensity of 
65 kt.
 
Henriette is moving beneath a region of upper-level convergence
between an upper-tropospheric low to the northwest of the cyclone
and an upper-level anticyclone to the northeast.  This inhibiting
dynamic contribution, along with increasing northerly shear and 
progressively cooler oceanic surface temperatures, should cause 
Henriette to weaken quickly through the remainder of the period.  
The majority of the deterministic models predict that Henriette 
should degenerate into a post-tropical cyclone by early Thursday 
and open up into a trough over the central north Pacific by the 
weekend.  Accordingly, quick weakening is indicated in the NHC 
forecast and resembles the previous one, and is very close to the 
LGEM and just above the HCCA and IVCN consensus intensity models.
 
The initial motion is estimated to be northwestward, or 315/14 kt.
Henriette should continue moving in this general heading during the
next couple of days in the mid-level steering flow provided by a
subtropical ridge to Henriette's northeast and a mid- to 
upper-level low located northwest of the cyclone.  Afterward, a 
weakened, vertically shallow Henriette should turn toward the 
north-northwest then to the north while rounding the western 
periphery of a low- to mid-level high to the east.  The new track 
forecast is essentially an update of the previous advisory and lies 
close to the various consensus aids.

Hurricane Henriette Discussion Number  31
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   EP082025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 AM HST Mon Aug 11 2025

Henriette now has a compact Central Dense Overcast, with a dimple 
noted in visible satellite imagery where a small eye could be 
attempting to form, surrounded by a long spiral band.  Subjective 
and objective satellite intensity estimates are relatively 
unchanged from 6 hours ago, so the initial intensity is still 
assumed to be around 75 kt.

The initial motion is also unchanged--northwestward, or 310/16 kt.  
The track guidance is tightly packed for the next 48-60 hours, with 
Henriette expected to continue moving northwestward between a 
mid-level low northwest of the Hawaiian Islands and a large ridge 
centered off the coast of the Pacific Northwest United States.  
There is more significant spread after 60 hours, related to whether 
or not Henriette gets picked up by a shortwave trough near the 
Aleutian Islands (and turns eastward, as in the GFS) or gets left 
behind and continues northward (as in the ECWMF).  The new NHC 
track forecast is a little east of the previous prediction at the 
end of the forecast, leaning toward the new consensus aids.
 
Some intensification is still possible during the next 12 hours or 
so while there remains some favorable divergence aloft, and the NHC 
intensity forecast reflects that potential.  By 24 hours, 
upper-level convergence, increasing northerly to northwesterly 
shear, and cooling sea surface temperatures are expected to induce 
weakening.  Henriette could lose its organized deep convection, and 
thus become post-tropical, in about 60 hours, with the remnant low 
likely dissipating by day 5 over the far northern Pacific.

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM HST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Henriette was
located near latitude 29.8 North, longitude 157.8 West.  Henriette 
is moving toward the northwest near 18 mph (30 km/h), and this 
general motion is expected to continue through Wednesday.  A turn 
toward the north-northwest at a slower forward speed is forecast on 
Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some slight strengthening is possible through tonight.  
Weakening is forecast to begin on Tuesday, with Henriette likely 
becoming a tropical storm by early Wednesday and then becoming 
post-tropical by late Wednesday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles
(110 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 986 mb (29.12 inches).

Mesoscale Discussion 1929
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0328 PM CDT Mon Aug 11 2025

Areas affected...central Oklahoma into northeast Oklahoma

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 112028Z - 112200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated damaging wind gusts are possible this
afternoon/evening.

DISCUSSION...A slow moving cold front is advancing southeast across
Oklahoma. Ahead of this front, temperatures in the low to mid 90s
and dewpoints in the upper 60s to low 70s have yielded 2500 J/kg
MLCAPE amid moderately steep mid-level lapse rates (~8 C/km per 12Z
OUN RAOB). A remnant MCV can be seen in visible satellite imagery
approaching central Oklahoma which will also likely be a focus for
stronger storms this afternoon/evening. Very weak shear (~15 knots
per TLX/INX VWP) will result in mostly unorganized convection,
although a few multicell clusters are possible. Isolated damaging
wind gusts will be possible, but no watch is anticipated.

Post-Tropical Cyclone Ivo Discussion Number  20
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092025
800 AM PDT Mon Aug 11 2025
 
The last bit of convection associated with Ivo dissipated about 15 
hours ago, and it has therefore degenerated into a remnant low.  
Maximum winds are estimated to be 25 kt, and further weakening is 
forecast as the system moves over colder waters.  Ivo is expected 
to open up into a trough--and thus dissipate--in about 36 hours, as 
depicted in global model fields.  Until that time, a low-level 
ridge to the north is expected to steer the remnant low westward at 
about 10 kt, and no major changes were made to the official track 
forecast.

Hurricane Henriette Discussion Number  29
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   EP082025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 PM HST Sun Aug 10 2025
 
The satellite presentation of Henriette had degraded earlier this 
evening, perhaps due to what appeared to be an eye wall replacement 
cycle, while the cyclone was also passing over a tongue of slightly 
cooler sea surface temperatures around 25.5C.  Recent satellite 
images however depict the eye becoming better defined and surrounded 
by cooling cloud tops.  The most recent subjective Dvorak current 
intensity estimates were 4.0/65 kt from PHFO and SAB, and 4.5/77 kt 
from JTWC.  Meanwhile, the objective estimates from UW-CIMSS have 
ranged between 65 and 76 kt during the past several hours.  Taking a 
blend of these estimates, the initial intensity has been held at 70 
kt for this advisory.
 
Henriette is moving toward the northwest, or 315 degrees, at 15 kt. 
This general motion is expected to continue during the next couple 
of days as the cyclone is steered between a mid-level low to the 
northwest of Hawaii and a building mid-level ridge far to the north 
of the cyclone.  A turn toward the north and a decrease in forward 
speed is expected beyond 60 hours as the increasingly shallow system 
is steered by a low to mid-level ridge to the east.  The official 
track forecast is near the middle of the guidance envelope and is 
very close to the previous advisory.
 
Henriette will remain over sufficiently warm water for some 
intensification during the next day or so, however, vertical wind 
shear is forecast to increase considerably by about 36 hours.  As a 
result, the official forecast calls for some strengthening during 
the next 24 hours, followed by slight weakening between 24 and 36 
hours, and more rapid weakening thereafter.  Henriette is expected 
to weaken into a post-tropical low by 72 hours, with dissipation 
expected by 120 hours.  The intensity forecast is mostly unchanged 
and is slightly higher than the intensity guidance in the near term, 
then close to the middle of the intensity guidance envelope beyond 
36 hours.

Tropical Depression Ivo Discussion Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092025
200 AM PDT Mon Aug 11 2025

Ivo has become devoid of deep convection as it moves over 
increasingly cooler waters and into a drier air mass.  The current 
intensity estimate is 30 kt which could be a bit generous based on 
partial scatterometer overpasses.

The motion continues west-northwestward, or around 295/9 kt.  Ivo 
should remain embedded in low-level easterly flow for the next day 
or two.  The track forecast is similar to that from the previous 
advisory and very close to the latest corrected consensus, HCCA, 
solution.

Since the system is expected to traverse even cooler waters during 
the next 36 hours or so, it is unlikely to regenerate significant 
deep convection.  Thus the cyclone will likely become a 
post-tropical remnant low very soon.  The global models depict 
the system opening up into a trough within 48 hours and this is 
reflected in the official forecast.

Hurricane Henriette Discussion Number  27
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   EP082025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 AM HST Sun Aug 10 2025

Henriette has put on quite the show today with a well-defined eye 
emerging during the past few hours along with cooling temperatures 
in the eyewall.  Dvorak intensity estimates were up to 65 kt by 
18Z, and with the further development on satellite since that time, 
the initial wind speed is set to 70 kt for this advisory. 

It remains to be seen how strong Henriette will get with an 
improving environment along its path during the next day or so, 
including decreasing shear, increasing SSTs and cooling upper-level 
temperatures.  Given that this rapid intensification period was not 
well forecast, and a recent closed 37 GHz ring on AMSR2 data, I'm 
inclined to go above the guidance in this situation and show near 
rapid intensification for about 24 h until the environment becomes 
more hostile.  Henriette should lose all deep convection in about 3 
days over cold waters and in very high shear.
 
The storm is moving northwestward at about 15 kt.  A large ridge
over the north-central Pacific should cause a continued fast
northwestward track of Henriette for several days until its slows 
down a bit near dissipation.  The only minor change to the previous 
forecast is a faster forward speed, probably a function of the 
hurricane feeling stronger upper-level southeasterly flow during 
the next couple of days.

Tropical Storm Ivo Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092025
200 PM PDT Sun Aug 10 2025
 
Even over waters of 23-24 degrees Celsius, Ivo is managing to 
maintain a persistent area of deep convection.  A recent ASCAT pass 
showed maximum winds of 30 kt.  Accounting for the instrument's 
sampling limitations, and combined with satellite estimates still 
running around 35 kt, it is estimated that Ivo is hanging on to 
tropical storm status.  Sea surface temperatures drop by another 2-3 
degrees along Ivo's forecast track, so weakening is expected to 
resume tonight, and simulated satellite images from the GFS and 
ECMWF show that deep convection could finally be gone by Monday 
morning.  Degeneration into a remnant low is forecast by 24 hours, 
followed by dissipation into a trough in 60 hours.
 
Ivo is moving west-northwestward (285 deg) at 10 kt.  This motion 
should continue for the next 12 hours, followed by a slight bend to 
the west in 24 hours as Ivo stays situated to the south of the low- 
to mid-level ridge.  The track models are tightly clustered, and 
the new NHC forecast is mainly an update of the previous 
prediction.

Tropical Storm Ivo Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092025
200 AM MST Sun Aug 10 2025

Ivo is weakening while it passes over the cooler waters well to the 
west of Baja California Sur, and its associated deep convection 
is gradually decreasing in coverage and intensity.  Data from an 
excellent scatterometer overpass just before 0500 UTC showed that 
the maximum winds have decreased to near 35 kt.  Subjective Dvorak 
analyses from TAFB and SAB, along with objective Dvorak values from 
UW-CIMSS gave a similar intensity estimate, indicating that Ivo is 
now at minimal tropical storm strength.

Center fixes indicate that the cyclone continues to move 
west-northwestward, or at about 285/7 kt.  A low- to mid-level 
ridge is predicted to remain to the north of Ivo during the next 
couple of days.  The system is likely to turn more westward with a 
slight increase in forward speed in a day or so as the increasingly 
shallow circulation becomes steered by the low-level easterlies.  
The official forecast track is very similar to the one from the 
previous advisory.

Ivo is moving over cooler waters with gradually decreasing 
environmental moisture.  Therefore weakening should continue, and 
the system will likely degenerate into a post-tropical remnant low 
in 24 hours or so.  The intensity forecast is similar to the 
previous NHC forecast and near the high end of the model guidance.

Tropical Storm Henriette Discussion Number  25
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   EP082025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 PM HST Sat Aug 09 2025
 
Satellite imagery shows that Henriette retains a well-organized 
low-level structure, with a curved band wrapping around the west 
side of the circulation. However, convection within the band has 
struggled to persist due to surrounding dry mid- to upper-level air. 
Subjective Dvorak current intensity estimates from SAB, JTWC, and 
HFO, along with objective estimates from UW-CIMSS, support holding 
the initial intensity at 35 kt for this advisory.

The initial motion is toward the northwest at 13 kt, steered by a 
subtropical ridge to the northeast and an amplifying mid-latitude 
trough to the northwest. Henriette’s forward speed is expected to 
increase through 36 hours, level off near 60 hours, and then slow 
through 96 hours as the steering flow weakens. This motion will keep 
Henriette well northeast of the Hawaiian Islands. Guidance indicates 
the sharp upper trough will cut off into an upper low on Monday and 
retrograde westward, a pattern that should maintain Henriette’s 
northwestward motion. The track forecast is very similar to the 
previous one but is slightly left of the earlier forecast from days 
3 to 4, and lies near the middle of the tightly clustered consensus 
aids.

Sea-surface temperatures along Henriette’s forecast track should 
gradually warm from near 25 degrees C to around 26–27 degrees C 
through about 60 h. Despite surrounding dry mid- to upper-level air, 
a combination of warmer waters and increasing upper-level divergence 
associated with an upper trough to the northwest should enhance 
outflow and support gradual strengthening. The NHC forecast 
continues to show a peak near 55 kt in the 36–48 h period, nearly 
identical to the previous forecast and within the middle to upper 
end of the guidance envelope. Thereafter, cooler waters, increasing 
shear, and diminishing upper-level outflow should result in steady 
weakening, with Henriette expected to become a post-tropical remnant 
low by 96 h and dissipate by 120 h as it is absorbed into the 
mid-latitude flow.

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM MST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ivo was
located near latitude 21.5 North, longitude 114.9 West. Ivo is
moving toward the west-northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h).  A gradual
turn toward the west with a slight increase in forward speed is
expected through early next week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Continued weakening is anticipated, and Ivo is forecast to become a 
post-tropical remnant low during the next day or so.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
