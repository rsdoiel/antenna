Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0651 AM CST Fri Jan 31 2025

Valid 311300Z - 011200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS SOUTHERN
ALABAMA...SOUTHWEST GEORGIA...AND THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms with isolated damaging gusts will be possible this
afternoon across parts of the central Gulf Coast.

...Southern AL/FL Panhandle into southwest GA...
Water-vapor imagery shows a mid- to upper-level low over the lower
MO Valley this morning.  This upper feature is forecast to evolve
into an open wave and accelerate eastward to the
Mid-Atlantic/Carolinas coast by early Saturday morning.  Strong
southwesterly mid-level flow will move through the base of the
larger-scale trough over the central Gulf Coast states today.  In
the low levels, an effective cold front extends southward through
western AL from an occluded surface low over the mid MS Valley. 
This front will push east during the day with southerly low-level
flow acting to advect a still-modifying airmass northward into the
FL Panhandle and AL/GA.  Scant buoyancy sampled this morning on the
12 UTC Birmingham, AL raob (100 J/kg MUCAPE) will contribute to
isolated thunderstorm development today.  However, weak lapse rates
and weak convergence associated with the front will likely limit
storm intensity.  Uncertainty remains whether robust updrafts can
develop with the low-topped convective band moving east across
southern AL this morning.  Intensification of this band is quite
uncertain at this time given a dearth of a severe signal in
convection-allowing model guidance and observational trends trending
lower.  Will maintain a low-probability wind highlight for now given
the aforementioned uncertainty.  

Elsewhere, weak instability may lead to isolated storms over central
GA into the Carolinas later today.  Forecast soundings show intense
flow fields with 100-300 J/kg MUCAPE possibly developing with a
neutral surface-1km AGL layer before frontal passage.  Confidence in
a strong storm over this region is low---precluding severe
probabilities.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0409 AM CST Fri Jan 31 2025

Valid 031200Z - 081200Z

...DISCUSSION...
A generally low-amplitude upper pattern, characterized by fast
westerly flow aloft, is expected to prevail through the medium-range
period.  Global models are in reasonably good agreement with most of
the synoptic-scale details into day 6 (Wednesday), after which
differences become increasingly apparent.

Days 4-5, the generally zonal flow pattern will persist, though some
minor amplification of troughing over the West is expected Day 5, as
the western Canada low drifts southward toward/into the Pacific
Northwest.  A rather subtle, lead shortwave trough is forecast to
shift across southern California into the Desert Southwest late day
5 (Tuesday), and into the central Plains through the first half of
day 6.  An associated, central Plains surface low is forecast to
evolve, with a cold front shifting out of the southern Rockies
toward the southern Plains.  With favorably strong flow aloft, any
elevated destabilization sufficient to support convective
development may result in some potential for hail across central
portions of the country.  At this time, however, expectations for
weak instability overall, and likelihood that the boundary layer
remains stable, should preclude appreciable surface based
thunderstorm potential.  In any case, any potential for severe
weather appears too low to warrant areal inclusion at this time.

The surface front should continue eastward/southeastward across the
U.S. days 6-7, but even weaker instability expected ahead of the
boundary should preclude any appreciable severe weather potential.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1246 AM CST Thu Jan 30 2025

Valid 311200Z - 011200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns will be limited across the country on Friday.
Widespread rain chances are expected to overspread the mid-MS and OH
River Valleys on Friday as the upper trough currently moving into
the southern Plains migrates east/northeast. A broad, but weak,
surface ridge building across the Four Corners and southern High
Plains will limit wind speeds within the driest air mass over the
country. Consequently, the potential for fire weather concerns
appears limited.

Mesoscale Discussion 0056
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0633 AM CST Tue Jan 28 2025

Areas affected...the Upper Michigan vicinity

Concerning...Heavy snow 

Valid 281233Z - 281700Z

SUMMARY...A period of heavy snow, at rates on the order of 1-2+
inches per hour, appears possible in a corridor overspreading the
central Upper Peninsula of Michigan vicinity by midday.

DISCUSSION...Downstream of a low-amplitude short wave perturbation,
accompanying an intense (110+ kt at 500 mb) jet streak digging
east-southeast of the Canadian Prairies, lower/mid-tropospheric warm
advection is overspreading the Upper Midwest into Great Lakes
region.  Associated forcing for ascent is becoming focused across
the southwestern flank of an arctic air mass now entrenched across
much of the Great Lakes region, particularly near a zone of strong
lower/mid-tropospheric frontogenesis, which is forecast to shift
from northwestern Ontario across the western Lake Superior and
central Upper Peninsula of Michigan vicinity through 17-18z.

Forecast soundings across this region indicate that the sub-freezing
thermodynamic profiles are in the process of saturating, ahead of an
ongoing band of moderate to heavy snow, which appears likely to be
maintained through at least early afternoon.  Temperatures appear
within a few degrees of -15C through an initially deep layer from
lower-levels into the 700-600 mb layer, where conditions will be
most conducive to large dendritic ice crystal growth.  Coinciding
with maximizing lift associated with the frontogenetic forcing, it
appears that this may support a 2-3 hour period of heavy snow rates
on the order of 1-2 inches per hour.  Forecast soundings also
indicate that a layer a steepening mid-level lapse rates may be
accompanied by the development of weak CAPE and embedded convective
development with heavier snow rates possible.
