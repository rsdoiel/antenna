Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0333 AM CDT Thu Jun 12 2025

Valid 151200Z - 201200Z

...DISCUSSION...
During the Sunday/D4 to Monday/D5 period, an upper ridge is forecast
to remain over the Plains, with modest southwest flow aloft over the
West. Models suggest that around Tuesday/D6, the upper ridge will
break down over the central/northern Plains, although the amplitude
and track of the wave is in question. Ample low-level moisture will
be in place from the Plains to the East Coast, with mid to upper 60s
F as far north as southern parts of the Great Lakes. 

As a result of this large area of moisture and instability, widely
scattered thunderstorms will be common each day. The northern Plains
appears to have the greatest change of organized severe storms
includes MCS/s, but predictability is clearly low at this time with
the uncertain wave. However, it appears that the Tuesday/D6 to
Wednesday/D7 time frame may yield a corridor of organized damaging
wind potential over parts of the northern and central plains to
Midwest, and these trends will continue to be monitored.

Mesoscale Discussion 1251
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0239 PM CDT Wed Jun 11 2025

Areas affected...Northeast TX into western LA and far southwest AR

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 111939Z - 112145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Gusty winds are possible the remainder of the afternoon as
a line of storms tracks northeast across the ArkLaTex vicinity.

DISCUSSION...A line of storms has maintained organization along
surging outflow as convection moves through a corridor of weak to
moderate instability this afternoon. Some embedded stronger cells
within this line are likely aided by 25-30 kt effective shear
magnitudes within the unstable airmass.  Precipitable water values
near 2 inches may further aid in sporadic wet microbursts, and
locally strong gusts will be possible the remainder of the
afternoon. Overall severe potential is expected to remain limited,
and a watch is not expected at this time.

Mesoscale Discussion 1250
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0156 PM CDT Wed Jun 11 2025

Areas affected...northern Iowa...southern Minnesota

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 111856Z - 112130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Severe wind and hail risk to continue through the
afternoon/early evening.

DISCUSSION...A broken line of thunderstorm activity that has a
history of producing 50-60 mph winds continues to show winds around
50-60 mph around 2kft on radar. Additional development is also noted
on visible satellite on the southern periphery of this broken line.
Some uncertainty remains on the duration of this wind threat, given
the downstream air mass is fairly mixed and less unstable. Steep
lapse rates and dew point depressions in the 30s to 40s may support
strong to severe gusts with outflow as these storms advance
eastward. 

Additional thunderstorm development is expected later on in the
afternoon with the ejecting wave, which may be supercellular with
potential for damaging wind/hail. As this may be the time period of
more appreciable threat, watch timing remains uncertain. However,
should the broken line advancing east out of SD continue to
intensify, a watch may be needed to cover this threat in the near
term.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0257 PM CDT Wed Jun 11 2025

Valid 112000Z - 121200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS
CENTRAL/EAST TEXAS AND PARTS OF THE MIDWEST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms associated with severe wind gusts and hail are
possible today across parts of Texas and the Upper Midwest.
Marginally severe storms will also be possible in parts of the
northern Intermountain region/northern High Plains and the
Mid-Atlantic/Carolinas.

...20z Update...
The previous forecast remains on track with only minor adjustments
needed to account for recent convective trends. Latest surface
observations/RAP mesoanalysis shows fairly stable conditions across
the TX Coastal Plain in the wake of the MCS currently approaching
the Sabine River. However, lingering low-level moisture coupled with
increasing ascent/cooler temperatures aloft associated with the
approaching mid-level trough should promote thunderstorm development
across the TX Slight risk area late tonight into early Thursday
morning. Latest forecast guidance and soundings continue to hint at
the potential for strong/severe storms, so opted to maintain current
risk categories despite the limited severe threat in the short-term.

..Moore.. 06/11/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1140 AM CDT Wed Jun 11 2025/

...Central/East Texas...
A complex/muddled mesoscale scenario exists regionally owing to a
decayed but lingering MCS across east/southeast Texas and multiple
lingering convectively enhanced MCVs in proximity to a
weak/slow-moving upper trough. Some supercell potential exists today
across East Texas and vicinity, with redevelopment expected later
today into tonight back west/southwest into central/south-central
Texas. Where air mass recovery/destabilization occurs, lingering
convectively enhanced flow field could support some supercells and
well-organized clusters capable of damaging winds, hail, and
possibly a tornado risk, pending a sustenance of moderately strong
winds in the lowest 2-3km AGL and possible outflow/
boundary-interaction factors.

...Upper Midwest including northern IA/southern MN/southern WI...
Have introduced a near-frontal-zone focused categorical Slight Risk
for an anticipated severe hail/wind risk expected later this
afternoon through early/mid-evening. This will be ahead of a
convectively-enhanced shortwave trough, with moderately strong
westerlies atop the west/east-oriented frontal zone. While low-level
moisture will not be robust by late-spring standards, steep lapse
rates and moderately strong buoyancy will support potentially severe
storms.

...Northern Great Basin/Rockies...
A readily evident shortwave trough in late-morning water vapor
imagery over southeast Oregon/northern Nevada and southwest Idaho
will continue east-northeastward today, reaching the northern High
Plains late tonight. Increasing forcing for ascent and mid-level
moisture will aid in the development of scattered afternoon/evening
thunderstorms, particularly from Idaho eastward across much of
Montana/Wyoming and northern Utah. The strongest storms will pose a
risk of severe-caliber wind gusts and some hail.

...Eastern Carolinas/southeast Virginia...
A moist/moderately unstable environment and modest-strength vertical
shear will support some potential for locally damaging winds and
hail until around sunset. See Mesoscale Discussion 1249 for
additional short-term details.

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Northern Iowa
  Southern Minnesota

* Effective this Wednesday afternoon and evening from 255 PM
  until 1000 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging winds likely with isolated significant gusts
    to 75 mph possible
  Scattered large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Clusters and bands of storms should further develop and
intensify this afternoon with wind damage and hail possible as
storms move east-southeastward within an increasingly unstable
environment.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 50
statute miles north and south of a line from 55 miles southwest of
Worthington MN to 70 miles east northeast of Waterloo IA. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0228 PM CDT Wed Jun 11 2025

Valid 131200Z - 141200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM PARTS OF
MONTANA SOUTHEASTWARD INTO THE CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe storms may occur Friday from Montana into the
central Plains, with hail and corridors of damaging winds possible.

...Synopsis...
A mid/upper-level shortwave trough will move from the Pacific
Northwest toward the northern Rockies/High Plains on Friday.
Downstream, considerable model variance remains regarding the
evolution of a weak mid/upper-level low initially centered over the
Ozarks vicinity. This system is generally expected to move eastward
and gradually weaken, but extensive convection in its vicinity on
D1/Wednesday into D2/Thursday results in greater than normal
uncertainty regarding its evolution by D3/Friday. 

...MT southeastward into the central/southern High Plains...
In advance of the approaching shortwave trough, low-level easterly
flow to the north of a lee cyclone will transport moisture into
parts of western/central MT and northern WY. Moderate
destabilization and increasing deep-layer shear will support
development of scattered strong to severe storms by afternoon. A few
supercells will be possible initially as storms develop near the
higher terrain of MT/WY, with a threat of hail and localized severe
gusts as they move eastward. One or more clusters may grow upscale
by evening, with corridors of strong to severe gusts possible. 

Deep-layer flow will be somewhat weaker into the central High
Plains, but still sufficient to support modestly organized storms
during the afternoon/evening. One or more clusters could eventually
spread eastward into western NE/KS by evening, aided by a nocturnal
low-level jet and accompanied by a severe-wind threat. Farther
south, storms may be more isolated into the southern High Plains,
but strong instability and marginal deep-layer shear could support
isolated hail and severe-wind potential.

...Ozarks into the Mississippi Valley/Ohio Valley vicinity...
Given the aforementioned uncertainty regarding the slow-moving
mid/upper-level low near the Ozarks, confidence in the details of
storm evolution near and downstream of this low are highly
uncertain. In general, scattered to numerous thunderstorms will be
possible during the afternoon/evening from the Ozarks and lower/mid
MS Valley into the OH Valley, within a moist, moderately unstable,
and weakly capped environment. Generally weak midlevel lapse rates
and modest deep-layer flow/shear should tend to limit overall storm
intensity, but isolated instances of damaging wind or hail cannot be
ruled out across a broad area, given the expected coverage of
storms. 

If convective augmentation of the mid/upper-level low results in
stronger wind profiles than currently forecast, or if storms can
develop along the southwest periphery of the low (where lapse rates
and shear will be stronger, but forcing will be weaker), then a more
organized severe threat could evolve. At this time, the threat
appears too nebulous for severe probabilities. 

Farther north, a strong storm or two could develop near a remnant
frontal boundary in the upper MS Valley vicinity, though a lack of
strong large-scale ascent and uncertainty regarding the frontal
position result in limited confidence regarding any localized severe
threat. 

...Mid Atlantic vicinity...
A moderately unstable and weakly capped environment is also expected
from parts PA southward into the Mid Atlantic and Carolinas Friday.
Scattered storm development is expected during the afternoon. A
modest westerly mid/upper-level flow regime could support a few
strong cells/clusters. Poor midlevel lapse rates and weak flow below
700 mb may tend to limit a more organized severe threat, but
localized instances of wind damage will be possible.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0214 PM CDT Wed Jun 11 2025

Valid 121200Z - 131200Z

...19z Update...
Have opted to shrink the Elevated area across the western Great
Basin in response to recent rainfall and weaker forecast winds.
While guidance suggests a few hours of dry and breezy conditions
remain possible in the lee of the Sierra, widespread 15-20 mph gusts
now appear unlikely. Otherwise, no changes were made. See the
previous discussion.

..Lyons.. 06/11/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0157 AM CDT Wed Jun 11 2025/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will impinge on the West Coast while mainly zonal
flow overspreads the northern CONUS tomorrow (Thursday). Similar to
Day 1, downslope flow along the lee of the Cascades and Sierra will
support Elevated fire weather conditions. At these locations, 15-20
mph sustained westerly surface winds and 15-20 percent RH will
overspread dry fuels for several hours tomorrow afternoon.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR PARTS OF THE
CENTRAL/NORTHERN PLAINS AND UPPER MIDWEST...AND ALSO FROM TX INTO
THE LOWER MS VALLEY...

...SUMMARY...
Widely scattered strong to severe storms are expected Thursday
across parts of the central to northern Plains and Upper Midwest.
Isolated strong to severe storms may also occur over parts of Texas
into the lower Mississippi Valley.

...Synopsis...
A low-amplitude mid/upper-level shortwave trough will move across
the northern Plains into the Upper Midwest on Thursday. A deeper
upstream shortwave trough will begin to influence the Pacific
Northwest. A weak mid/upper-level low is forecast to drift
north-northeastward across eastern portions of the southern Plains. 


At the surface, a lee cyclone may gradually deepen during the day
across the central High Plains, while a weak frontal wave is
forecast to develop and move eastward from southern SD into
southwest MN. 

...Eastern SD/southern MN into northeast NE/northern IA...
Elevated convection and possibly a MCV/remnant MCS may move across
parts of the Dakotas into MN during the morning. In the wake of the
morning convection, an outflow-influenced surface front is forecast
to move northward across northern NE/IA into parts of eastern SD and
southern MN. While deep-layer flow will be relatively modest, a
localized zone of conditional supercell potential could eventually
evolve near and just north of the front, where increasing low-level
moisture will support moderate buoyancy and surface winds will be
favorably backed. 

If any supercells can develop within this regime, then hail,
damaging winds, and perhaps a tornado would all be possible. With
the primary shortwave trough generally forecast to dampen with time
and be displaced somewhat north of the more favorable environment,
coverage of diurnal supercell development (if any) is uncertain.
Greater severe probabilities may eventually be needed if confidence
in this scenario increases. Otherwise, storm coverage may generally
increase north of the front from late afternoon into the evening
within a low-level warm-advection regime, with some clustering
possible as convection spreads across southern MN Thursday night. 

...Parts of the central/northern High Plains...
High-based convection is expected to develop Thursday afternoon
across parts of northeast CO/eastern WY. Deep-layer flow will be
rather weak, but modestly veering wind profiles and sufficient
buoyancy could support localized hail and strong to severe gusts
with initial development. With time, an outflow-driven cluster could
spread into the NE Panhandle, with potentially a somewhat greater
concentration of strong/severe gusts. 

...Southern/central/east TX into the ArkLaMiss region...
Extensive convection will likely be ongoing Thursday morning across
parts of central/east TX. Rich low-level moisture, moderate
buoyancy, and modestly enhanced low/midlevel flow could support at
least an isolated threat for a tornado, locally damaging gusts, and
perhaps some hail with the morning convection. 

Storm evolution during the day is uncertain, but in general, an arc
of convection may spread northeastward toward the ArkLaTex/ArkLaMiss
vicinities during the afternoon, in conjunction with the primary
mid/upper-level low or any MCVs that develop. Locally damaging wind
and possibly a tornado could accompany the storms within this
regime. 

Some redevelopment is also possible along the trailing outflow
during the afternoon and evening into south-central TX, with a
threat of localized hail and wind-damage. 

...Western/central PA into the northern Mid Atlantic...
Moderate destabilization is expected Thursday afternoon from parts
of western/central PA into the northern Mid Atlantic, along and
south of a cold front. This region will be on the southern periphery
of stronger west-northwesterly flow aloft, and with sufficient
deep-layer shear for organized convection. However, with large-scale
ascent generally displaced well to the north and very weak
convergence expected along the front, potential for sustained deep
convection currently appears limited. Severe probabilities may be
needed if a stronger signal for robust development emerges with
time.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1143 AM CDT Wed Jun 11 2025

Valid 111700Z - 121200Z

...17z Update Northwest...
Scattered to numerous thunderstorms ongoing over eastern OR and
western ID may pose a risk for occasional lightning ignitions
through the afternoon. However, with fairly widespread observed QPE
approaching 0.25 inches, area fuels have likely been moderated. This
suggests the risk for dry thunderstorms is relatively low.

...Great Basin...
Minor changes were made to the Elevated area for recent rainfall
accumulations. Dry and breezy conditions with winds gusting 15-25
mph remain possible this afternoon. See the previous discussion.

..Lyons.. 06/11/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0156 AM CDT Wed Jun 11 2025/

...Synopsis...
Multiple mid-level impulses will traverse the Interior West as
upper-ridging builds over the central and eastern CONUS today.
Upper-support associated with the mid-level impulses will encourage
dry and windy conditions to the lee of both the Cascades and Sierra
(overspreading the northern Great Basin). In both of these areas,
15-20 mph sustained westerly surface winds amid 15-20 percent RH
will overlap with at least modestly dry fuels for several hours,
warranting the maintenance of Elevated highlights.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS
CENTRAL/EAST TEXAS AND PARTS OF THE MIDWEST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms associated with severe wind gusts and hail are
possible today across parts of Texas and the Upper Midwest.
Marginally severe storms will also be possible in parts of the
northern Intermountain region/northern High Plains and the
Mid-Atlantic/Carolinas.

...Central/East Texas...
A complex/muddled mesoscale scenario exists regionally owing to a
decayed but lingering MCS across east/southeast Texas and multiple
lingering convectively enhanced MCVs in proximity to a
weak/slow-moving upper trough. Some supercell potential exists today
across East Texas and vicinity, with redevelopment expected later
today into tonight back west/southwest into central/south-central
Texas. Where air mass recovery/destabilization occurs, lingering
convectively enhanced flow field could support some supercells and
well-organized clusters capable of damaging winds, hail, and
possibly a tornado risk, pending a sustenance of moderately strong
winds in the lowest 2-3km AGL and possible outflow/
boundary-interaction factors.

...Upper Midwest including northern IA/southern MN/southern WI...
Have introduced a near-frontal-zone focused categorical Slight Risk
for an anticipated severe hail/wind risk expected later this
afternoon through early/mid-evening. This will be ahead of a
convectively-enhanced shortwave trough, with moderately strong
westerlies atop the west/east-oriented frontal zone. While low-level
moisture will not be robust by late-spring standards, steep lapse
rates and moderately strong buoyancy will support potentially severe
storms.

...Northern Great Basin/Rockies...
A readily evident shortwave trough in late-morning water vapor
imagery over southeast Oregon/northern Nevada and southwest Idaho
will continue east-northeastward today, reaching the northern High
Plains late tonight. Increasing forcing for ascent and mid-level
moisture will aid in the development of scattered afternoon/evening
thunderstorms, particularly from Idaho eastward across much of
Montana/Wyoming and northern Utah. The strongest storms will pose a
risk of severe-caliber wind gusts and some hail.

...Eastern Carolinas/southeast Virginia...
A moist/moderately unstable environment and modest-strength vertical
shear will support some potential for locally damaging winds and
hail until around sunset. See Mesoscale Discussion 1249 for
additional short-term details.

NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032025
800 AM MST Wed Jun 11 2025
 
Drier mid-level air and stable atmospheric conditions have taken 
their toll on Cosme. The system has been devoid of deep convection 
for more than 12 hours, with only a swirl of low- to mid-level 
clouds evident on satellite imagery. The initial intensity has 
been lowered to 30 kt. Given the hostile environment and ongoing 
lack of convection, Cosme is not expected to redevelop, and this 
will be the final advisory.

The low is now moving toward the east-northeast at about 070/6 kt. 
Global model guidance indicates a gradual turn toward the 
north-northeast later today, followed by a turn to the north on 
Thursday, as the system steadily spins down and dissipates over the 
next day or so.

Valid 111300Z - 121200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON AND
EVENING OVER PORTIONS OF EAST TEXAS...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms associated with severe gusts and hail will be possible
today across parts of Texas. Marginally severe storms will also be
possible in parts of the Upper Midwest and northwestern states.

...Southeast TX...
Multiple clusters of thunderstorms are affecting areas from
north-central to deep south TX this morning.  These storms are
drifting slowly eastward and will likely weaken through
late-morning.  By mid-afternoon, redevelopment of strong
thunderstorms is expected along residual outflow boundaries and a
quasi-stationary front that extends from east TX into LA.  The
scenario for organized severe thunderstorms in this region is
nebulous, but forecast soundings show pockets of favorable
environment for hail and gusty winds.  

...MN/IA...
A compact convectively-enhanced shortwave trough is present this
morning over SD.  This feature will track eastward today, with most
CAM solutions suggesting a small cluster of thunderstorms moving
from southeast SD eastward along the MN/IA border.  Sufficient
afternoon CAPE and steep low-level lapse rates will probably be
sufficient for a few strong wind gusts and perhaps some hail with
these storms.  Some consideration was given to a small SLGT risk in
this zone, but will defer to later outlook updates.

...Northern Great Basin/Rockies...
A well-defined shortwave trough is moving across OR/NV.  Increasing
large-scale lift and mid-level moisture will aid in the development
of scattered afternoon/evening thunderstorms from ID eastward across
much of MT/WY/northern UT.  The strongest storms will pose a risk of
locally damaging wind gusts and perhaps hail.

Tropical Storm Cosme Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032025
200 AM MST Wed Jun 11 2025
 
Drier mid-level air and stable atmospheric conditions have taken
their toll on Cosme. The system has been devoid of deep convection
for several hours and is expected to become a remnant low later this
morning. Dvorak intensity estimates continue to decrease
accordingly. A 11/0442 UTC ASCAT pass showed winds in the 35-40 kt
range in the southern semicircle. Assuming additional weakening
after that time, the initial intensity is set at 35 kt.  After
transitioning to a remnant low later this morning, Cosme is expected
to dissipate by late Thursday or Friday.
 
The storm is now moving slowly toward the northeast. A gradual turn
to the north-northeast with some acceleration is expected later
today, followed by a turn to the north on Thursday. Only a slight
eastward adjustment was made to the previous NHC track forecast,
with no significant changes to the intensity forecast.

Mesoscale Discussion 1243
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0350 PM CDT Tue Jun 10 2025

Areas affected...Far Northern CA...Southern/Eastern OR

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 102050Z - 102315Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated hail and/or damaging gusts are possible from far
northern CA into southern and eastern OR this afternoon and evening.

DISCUSSION...Visible satellite imagery shows increasing coverage of
deep cumulus across the higher terrain of far northeast CA and
south-central OR, with several instances of convective initiation.
Some additional increase in storm coverage is anticipated as
southwesterly flow and large-scale ascent gradually strengthen.
Isolated hail could occur with this early-stage cellular convection.
A deeply mixed airmass exists downstream, and the general
expectation is for damaging gusts as the storms become more outflow
dominant as they move off the terrain over the next few hours.

Tropical Storm Barbara Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP022025
200 PM MST Tue Jun 10 2025
 
This afternoon's satellite presentation shows Barbara quickly
spinning down.  Deep convection associated with the cyclone has
diminished considerably during the past few hours and has revealed
an exposed surface circulation well to the northeast of a 
mid-level center.  The initial intensity is once again lowered, to 
35 kt, and is based on a blend of the various subjective and 
objective satellite intensity estimates.

Based on current convective trends and the global models, Barbara 
should become a remnant low later tonight while it continues moving 
over cooler waters and into a harsh atmospheric environment. 
 
Barbara has been moving to the right of track within the peripheral
steering flow of the low- to mid-level high anchored over central
Mexico.  Consequently, the initial motion is estimated to be
northward or 010/7 kt.  Barbara should continue this general motion
through dissipation on Wednesday.  The official track forecast
is adjusted to the right of the previous advisory and lies close to 
the ECMWF and TVCE consensus models.

200 PM PDT Tue Jun 10 2025
 
Although Cosme's low-level center is obscured by high-level cirrus, 
it does appear to be displaced a bit to the northeast of the 
remaining deep convection.  Satellite intensity estimates have 
continued to decrease, with objective numbers ranging between 35-45 
kt, and subjective Dvorak CI numbers between 45-55 kt.  The advisory 
intensity is set at 45 kt based on a blend of these numbers.  An 
earlier ASCAT pass showed winds just over 40 kt in the southwestern 
quadrant, but the southeastern quadrant, where there could be 
stronger winds, was not sampled.

ASCAT and recent visible imagery suggest Cosme's center is a little 
west of where it was placed this morning.  Still, the storm has 
turned north-northwestward with an initial motion of 330/3 kt.  
Cosme is expected to turn northward and then northeastward and 
speed up a bit through Wednesday, before turning back to the 
north-northwest on Thursday.  This track will take Cosme over 
progressively cooler waters and into a drier, more stable 
environment.  Combined with moderate-to-strong northeasterly shear, 
these conditions should cause quick weakening, and GFS- and 
ECWMF-based simulated satellite images suggest that Cosme will lose 
its deep convection overnight.  As a result, the NHC official 
forecast shows Cosme becoming a remnant low within 24 hours, with 
dissipation now expected by 60 hours.

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM MST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Barbara was 
located near latitude 20.9 North, longitude 108.1 West.  Barbara is 
moving toward the north near 8 mph (13 km/h), and this general 
motion is expected to continue through tonight.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 40 mph (65 km/h) with 
higher gusts.  Continued weakening is forecast, and Barbara is 
expected to become a remnant low tonight and dissipate on
Wednesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Barbara will affect portions of the coast
of southwestern and west-central Mexico, as well as the southernmost
portions of Baja California Sur through today. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

located near latitude 15.8 North, longitude 115.1 West.  Cosme is
moving toward the north-northwest near 3 mph (6 km/h).  A turn 
toward the north and northeast with an increase in forward speed is 
expected through Wednesday, followed by a turn back to the 
north-northwest on Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 50 mph (85 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Additional weakening is forecast, and Cosme is 
expected to degenerate into a remnant low on Wednesday.  The 
remnant low is forecast to dissipate by late Thursday or Friday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 406
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
145 PM CDT Tue Jun 10 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Southeast New Mexico
  Far West int West Texas

* Effective this Tuesday afternoon and evening from 145 PM until
  900 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2.5
    inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm coverage is expected to increase over the
next few hours as the airmass continues to destabilize. Steep
mid-level lapse rates and moderate deep-layer shear will support
supercells, with large to very large hail as the primary hazard.
Over time, upscale growth into a convective line is possible, with
this line then progressing southeastward into more of west Texas.
Damaging gusts are the primary risk once this linear transition
occurs.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 110
statute miles east and west of a line from 35 miles northeast of
Carlsbad NM to 70 miles southwest of Dryden TX. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU6).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
27030.

...Mosier

Tropical Storm Cosme Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032025
200 AM MST Tue Jun 10 2025

The convective appearance of Cosme has changed little since the 
previous advisory.  The latest subjective Dvorak estimates from 
TAFB and SAB range from 55-65 kt, and the latest objective 
intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS range from 54-59 kt.  The initial 
intensity is held at 60 kt for this advisory, based on a blend of 
the intensity estimates.

Cosme continues to move very slowly toward the northwest, with 
motion estimated at 300/4 kt. A slow motion, perhaps more toward 
the north, should continue for at least the next 12 h since the 
overall steering currents are weak, due to Barbara's current 
position in relation to Cosme.  However, as Barbara weakens, Cosme 
will accelerate north-northeastward in response to ridging located 
to the northwest of the cyclone. Very little change has been made 
to the NHC track forecast, and the latest forecast is near the 
various consensus models.

Cosme is forecast to remain in favorable enough conditions for the 
next 24 h such that the cyclone might be able to maintain its 
intensity or only weaken very slowly.  However, after that time, as 
Cosme gains latitude, it will encounter cooler water and drier air. 
Cosme is forecast to lose its convection and become post-tropical on 
Wednesday, in agreement with the GFS and ECMWF simulated satellite 
imagery products.  The post-tropical low is then forecast to 
gradually weaken and dissipate by 72 h.  The NHC intensity forecast 
is similar to the previous one, and is near the middle of the 
guidance envelope.

Tropical Storm Barbara Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP022025
200 AM MST Tue Jun 10 2025

Barbara has lost a significant portion of its convection over the 
past 12 hours or so.  The latest current intensity estimates from 
TAFB and SAB are still in the 55-65 kt range, but the latest 
objective intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS are in the 45-55 kt 
range.  Based on the degraded convective appearance on geostationary 
satellite imagery and the latest intensity estimates, the initial 
intensity is set to 50 kt.

Barbara has been moving toward the northwest a little slower than 
before, or 310/7 kt.  Barbara is forecast to continue moving 
generally toward the northwest as it is steered by weak ridging to 
its north and Tropical Storm Cosme, located to its southwest.  Only 
very minor adjustments have been made to the previous NHC track 
forecast, which lies near the various consensus models.

The storm already has crossed the 26C isotherm and will continue 
moving over progressively colder water over the next day.  The cold 
water will cause Barbara to continue weakening.  The NHC intensity 
forecast shows a slightly faster rate of weakening than the previous 
official forecast, and is near the latest intensity model consensus. 
 The GFS and ECMWF simulated satellite products both show the 
cyclone losing its convection entirely by about 24 hours, with 
dissipation in 36 hours.  The NHC forecast follows the scenario 
depicted by those models.

BULLETIN
Tropical Storm Barbara Advisory Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP022025
200 AM MST Tue Jun 10 2025
 
...BARBARA CONTINUES TO WEAKEN OFFSHORE OF WEST-CENTRAL MEXICO...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 200 AM MST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...19.1N 108.1W
ABOUT 180 MI...290 KM WSW OF CABO CORRIENTES MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...60 MPH...95 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 310 DEGREES AT 8 MPH...13 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...999 MB...29.50 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM MST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Barbara was
located near latitude 19.1 North, longitude 108.1 West. Barbara is
moving toward the northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h) and this general 
motion is expected to continue for the next day or so.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 60 mph (95 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Continued weakening is forecast, and Barbara is 
expected to dissipate by Wednesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Barbara will affect portions of the coast
of southwestern and west-central Mexico, as well as the southernmost
portions of Baja California through today. These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 800 AM MST.

Mesoscale Discussion 1228
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0351 PM CDT Mon Jun 09 2025

Areas affected...eastern Ohio...western Pennsylvania...far West
Virginia...far southwestern New York

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 401...

Valid 092051Z - 092145Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 401
continues.

SUMMARY...Severe threat continues within WW401.

DISCUSSION...Several broken segments of multi-cell clusters continue
across WW401. A few instances of wind damage have been reported
across northern PA and southern OH. A few cells have initiated out
head of the main clusters but have struggle to maintain intensity.
Ahead of the line, temperatures continue to warm, with MLCAPE around
500 J/kg slowly advecting northward across New York state. As
forcing for ascent continues to increase with the approaching wave,
thunderstorm coverage will continue to increase. Damaging wind and
severe hail continue to be a possibility with stronger cells.

Hurricane Barbara Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP022025
200 PM MST Mon Jun 09 2025
 
Since the last advisory Barbara has become a little less organized. 
Latest GOES satellite imagery depicts the system starting to ingest 
some drier air which has caused fragmented banding. However, a 
central dense overcast has remained over the tiny inner core. The 
satellite intensity estimates have decreased slightly from the 
previous advisory ranging from 50 to 65 kt. Using these estimates, 
the intensity is held at 65 kt, although this may be generous.

A mid-level ridge located over Mexico should continue to steer the 
system northwestward over the next couple of days. As Barbara begins 
to weaken into a shallow vortex and slow down, it will be steered by 
the low-level wind flow. The latest NHC track forecast is similar to 
the previous one, and close to the simple and corrected consensus.
 
Barbara likely has peaked as a short-lived hurricane. The 
environmental conditions will becoming increasingly hostile along 
the forecast track with the storm crossing into cooler SSTs and into 
a drier, more stable air mass. This will cause the system to 
steadily weaken, lose convective organization, and become post 
tropical by 36 h. The latest NHC forecast shows the system opening 
into a trough by 60 h and dissipating.

Tropical Storm Cosme Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032025
200 PM MST Mon Jun 09 2025
 
Cosme continues to intensify and is nearing hurricane strength.
Visible satellite images show that the convective bands have
consolidated near the center, and there is some evidence of a
partial inner core. A blend of the latest objective and subjective
satellite intensity estimates support increasing the initial
intensity to 60 kt. A partial ASCAT pass indicates that the
wind field of Cosme is quite compact, and the initial wind radii
have been updated based on that data.
 
Some additional strengthening is possible in the short term, and
Cosme could become a hurricane tonight while it remains in 
generally conducive environmental conditions. However, the 
combination of decreasing SSTs and intrusions of dry/stable air
should end the strengthening trend by early Tuesday and then cause a
quick weakening. Simulated satellite images from the GFS and ECMWF
models show deep convection vanishing by Wednesday, and based on
that guidance, the transition to a remnant low has been moved up to
48 hours. Dissipation is likely to occur in 3 to 4 days.
 
The storm is moving northwestward at 8 kt, and this general motion
should continue through tonight. After that time, a turn to the
north or north-northeast is expected as Cosme moves toward a
weakness left behind by Hurricane Barbara to its northeast.  The
NHC track forecast is in fair agreement with the consensus aids.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM MST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Cosme was
located near latitude 15.0 North, longitude 113.9 West. Cosme is
moving toward the northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h) and this
general motion is expected to continue through tonight. A turn
toward the north with a decease in forward speed is expected by
early Tuesday, followed by a faster north-northeast motion late
Tuesday through Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 70 mph (110 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Some additional strengthening is forecast, and
Cosme could become a hurricane tonight. Rapid weakening is expected 
late Tuesday and Wednesday. Cosme will likely become a 
post-tropical low in a couple of days.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 992 mb (29.30 inches).

Review your severe weather safety procedures for the possibility
of dangerous weather today. Stay tuned to NOAA Weather Radio,
weather.gov, or other media for watches and warnings. A watch
means that conditions are favorable for severe thunderstorms
over the next several hours. If a severe thunderstorm warning is
issued for your area, move to a place of safety, ideally in an 
interior room on the lowest floor of a sturdy building.

Tropical Storm Barbara Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP022025
200 AM MST Mon Jun 09 2025
 
Barbara has become a bit better organized over the past 6 hours 
with a large central dense overcast and an increasing area of 
cloud tops in the -75C to -85C range.  The latest subjective Dvorak 
estimates from TAFB and SAB range from 55-65 kt, and the latest 
objective intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS range from 46-68 kt.  
Based on the improved banding and cold cloud tops, as well as the 
persistence of this organization, the initial intensity is 
increased to 60 kt for this advisory.

There is some uncertainty in the initial position since there have 
been no recent available microwave passes, but the best motion 
estimate is west-northwestward, or 295 degrees at 10 kt.  The 
global models show a strong 500 mb ridge to the north of Barbara, 
which should help maintain Barbara on a general path toward the 
west-northwest for the next few days.  The GFS model continues 
to be the fastest and farthest left model.  The GFS appears to 
have a more realistic solution compared to the ECMWF, and was 
stronger at the initialization time.  The new NHC forecast is 
slightly faster and a bit to the left of the previous official 
forecast and is in fairly good agreement with an average of the 
simple and corrected consensus models.

Barbara only has about 12 more hours to strengthen before it starts 
moving into cooler waters.  This should be enough time for Barbara 
to strengthen to a hurricane.  The cooler water should cause 
weakening to begin tonight or on Tuesday.  The dynamical hurricane 
models and global models all show Barbara weakening below tropical 
storm strength by 48 hours, and the cyclone is likely to lose its 
convection and become a remnant low around that time.  The new NHC 
forecast shows a faster weakening and quicker dissipation than the 
previous official forecast since the dynamical guidance is now in 
good agreement on this scenario.

Tropical Storm Cosme Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032025
200 AM MST Mon Jun 09 2025
 
The satellite presentation of Cosme has continued to gradually 
improve since the previous advisory, with sustained deep convection 
holding over the low-level center. A timely 09/0524Z ASCAT pass 
helped with the initial intensity and 34 kt wind radii estimates, 
with several wind barbs showing 40 to 45 knot winds. The latest 
subjective Dvorak intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB were T3.0/45 
knots and T2.5/35 knots respectively. Meanwhile, the objective 
Dvorak satellite estimates range from 40 to 50 knots. The initial 
intensity has been adjusted up to 45 knots with this advisory 
package, in line with the most recent ASCAT pass.

Cosme is moving toward west-northwest at 8 kt. This general motion 
is expected to continue during the next 24 hours to the south of a 
mid-level ridge, with a gradual slowing in forward speed. Tonight 
and Tuesday Barbara is forecast to erode the mid-level ridge to the 
north of Cosme, resulting in a further slowing in motion and a shift 
to the north. An increase in forward speed and a motion to the 
north-northeast is expected Tuesday night, with Cosme forecast to 
become a post-tropical remnant low on Wednesday. The latest track 
forecast is very close to that of the previous advisory and is 
generally a blend of the consensus guidance.

Environmental conditions continue to look conducive for 
strengthening of Cosme during the next 24 hours or so. Vertical wind 
shear will lighten up some while the system passes over 27/28C water 
with abundant deep layer moisture. The intensity forecast is similar 
to the previous advisory, bringing Cosme close to hurricane strength 
late today or tonight. Beyond 24 hours, vertical wind shear is 
forecast to increase and mid-level moisture is forecast to decrease, 
which should lead to a gradual weakening of Cosme. A more rapid 
weakening is then expected by Wednesday as the system moves over 
much cooler water, with Cosme expected to dissipate by 96 hours.

Mesoscale Discussion 1205
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0350 PM CDT Sun Jun 08 2025

Areas affected...portions of eastern Colorado and New Mexico

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 082050Z - 082245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Large hail and severe wind threat possible this afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorm development has been ongoing across the
Front Range in Colorado and across northeastern New Mexico. The air
mass across Colorado remains under the influence of MLCIN, with
temperatures cooling with northern extend behind the surface cold
front. Moisture is also somewhat limited, with dew points in the
upper 40s to 50s. A few instances of severe hail will be possible.

Across eastern New Mexico near the dryline, a gradient of more
appreciable MLCAPE 500-1500 j/kg is in place along with deep layer
shear around 30-45 kts. Temperatures are in the mid 70s to 80s amid
dew points in the 50s to upper 60s. This may support some instances
of severe wind and hail, with at least one supercell noted on radar.
Trends will be monitored for watch potential, but it appears
unlikely at this time.

Mesoscale Discussion 1204
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0331 PM CDT Sun Jun 08 2025

Areas affected...Portions of northern/central VA and MD

Concerning...Tornado Watch 392...

Valid 082031Z - 082200Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 392 continues.

SUMMARY...A risk for tornadoes and damaging wind gusts will persist
into early evening across northern/central Virginia, and portions of
Maryland.

DISCUSSION...Isolated storms are ongoing closer to a surface
boundary across eastern VA, and further west across the higher
terrain of central VA. These storms will continue to shift east
across a moderately unstable airmass and within 30-40 kt effective
shear. A surface boundary extending from northern VA southeast into
southeast VA will continue to support a corridor of enhanced
low-level shear supporting storm rotation. A couple tornadoes and
damaging gusts will remain possible over the next few hours.

Mesoscale Discussion 1203
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0330 PM CDT Sun Jun 08 2025

Areas affected...portions of western Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 082030Z - 082230Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Large hail and severe wind threat may increase through the
afternoon/early evening.

DISCUSSION...Supercells have developed across the Davis Mountains in
far western Texas this afternoon. The environment in this region is
characterized by MLCAPE around 500-1500 J/kg, steep lapse rates, and
deep layer shear around 40-45 kts. This will support potential for
supercells to produce some instances of large to very large hail and
severe winds. MLCIN does increase with eastward extent, which may
limit coverage/duration of this threat. This area will be monitored
for watch potential.

Mesoscale Discussion 1202
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0317 PM CDT Sun Jun 08 2025

Areas affected...portions of southwestern and north-central
Texas...southwestern Oklahoma

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 082017Z - 082215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...Large hail/tornado threat to increase through the
afternoon before a more significant wind threat emerges.

DISCUSSION...Supercell thunderstorms are ongoing across portions of
the Oklahoma and Texas Panhandles as of this hour, with at least one
tornado reported in Cimarron/Dallam counties. Additional development
is ongoing west of Amarillo. It is likely some mix of supercell
clusters will advance south and eastward through time, with
potential for additional development to occur ahead of the dryline
in New Mexico.

Low-level shear improves with southward extent into Lubbock where
surface winds are backed southeasterly improving low-level curvature
of hodographs and streamwise vorticity. It is likely that as storms
develop and move southward, the tornado threat will increase through
time even with the shifting storm mode.

A sharp gradient of extreme MLCAPE exists along the Red River near
the Texas/Oklahoma border into north-central Texas amid steep low to
mid-level lapse rates. As upscale growth increases, the potential
will rapidly increase for destructive winds (80-100 mph). A Tornado
or PDS Severe Watch is likely needed to cover this potential.

Tropical Storm Barbara Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP022025
300 PM CST Sun Jun 08 2025
 
Deep convection continues to burst over the center of Barbara this 
afternoon, with cold cloud tops near -75 C. However, a dry slot in 
the eastern semi-circle looks to have slightly disrupted the 
convective organization. Subjective and objective intensity 
estimates range from 45-55 kt this cycle. Using a blend of satellite 
estimates and the latest imagery the intensity is held at 50 kt for 
this advisory.
 
Barbara is currently within a favorable environment with warm SSTs 
and low vertical wind shear. Strengthening is forecast over the next 
day or so, and Barbara is forecast to become a hurricane overnight. 
After 24 h, the system will be moving over cooler sea surface 
temperatures below 26C and into a drier mid-level environment. These 
factors will cause the storm to weaken and eventually struggle to 
produce convection. Latest model IR simulated satellite imagery 
shows the system losing convection by 72 h.  This suggests that 
it will become a a post-tropical remnant low by that time and 
likely dissipate  by day 5 although that could occur sooner than 
currently forecast.
 
Barbara is moving west-northwestward at 295/10, steered by 
a mid-level ridge over Mexico, and this motion should continue over 
the next couple of days. The NHC forecast was nudged slightly 
rightward and lies just left of the the simple and corrected 
consensus aids.  Given the forecast track and wind radii, 
tropical-storm-force winds are not expected to affect the 
southwestern coast of Mexico. By Tuesday, the track forecast becomes 
more complicated given the potential interaction between Barbara and 
Cosme. The GFS and ECMWF are on opposite ends of the guidance 
envelope.

Tropical Storm Cosme Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032025
200 PM MST Sun Jun 08 2025
 
Deep convection has been increasing near the center and in curved
bands on the western side of the circulation during the past
several hours. An ASCAT-C pass from a few hours ago showed peak
winds in the 35-40 kt range, and based on that data, the depression
has been upgraded to Tropical Storm Cosme with the initial
intensity set at 40 kt.
 
Cosme will likely continue to strengthen for the next day or two as
it remains in an environment of low to moderate wind shear, abundant
moisture, and over warm SSTs. The NHC intensity forecast shows a
peak of 60 kt at 24 and 36 hours, and it wouldn't be surprising if
Cosme becomes a hurricane during that time frame. By mid-week,
however, the storm is expected to move over progressively cooler
waters and into a drier airmass, which should cause the system to
begin weakening. Cosme is now forecast to become a remnant low in 3
days and dissipate in 4 days.

The storm is moving northwestward at 7 kt, and that general motion 
is expected to continue during the next couple of days.  After that 
time, the interaction with Barbara will likely result in an initial 
slow down and then turn to the northeast. There is a fair amount of 
spread in the guidance due to the complexity of this interaction.  
The NHC track forecast has been adjusted a little to the right of 
the previous one to account for the initial motion/position and to 
be in better agreement with the latest consensus aids.

Tropical Storm Barbara Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP022025
300 AM CST Sun Jun 08 2025
 
Showers and thunderstorms have become better organized in 
association with an area of low pressure located offshore of 
southwestern Mexico. A small, persistent area of deep convection has 
been observed in satellite images tonight, and recent scatterometer 
data confirm this has led to the formation of a well-defined, closed 
low-level circulation. Therefore, the NHC is starting advisories on 
Tropical Storm Barbara with an initial intensity of 40 kt based on 
the earlier scatterometer winds.

Barbara is currently within a moist and relatively low shear 
environment over warm waters. So, strengthening is expected during 
the next day or so, and this could occur quickly given recent 
satellite trends and the small size of the storm. The official NHC 
forecast shows Barbara becoming a hurricane in 24 h, which is 
supported by HAFS-A/B and the HFIP corrected consensus (HCCA). The 
window for strengthening is brief, as Barbara is forecast to move 
over cooler waters and into a drier mid-level environment by 48 h. 
This should disrupt the convective structure of the storm and result 
in weakening. By day 5, the remnant low of Barbara is forecast to 
either dissipate or become absorbed by the circulation of EP91.

Barbara is moving west-northwestward (295/10 kt) on the south side 
of a mid-level ridge, and this motion should continue over the next 
couple of days. For this time period, the NHC forecast generally 
lies near or between the simple and corrected consensus aids. Given 
the forecast track and wind radii, tropical-storm-force winds 
are not expected to affect the southwestern coast of Mexico. By 
Tuesday, the track forecast becomes more complicated given the 
potential for binary interaction between Barbara and another 
disturbance (EP91) with a high chance of formation. Because of this, 
the long-range track forecast could be subject to larger future 
adjustments depending on the evolution of EP91.
