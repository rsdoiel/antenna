Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0715 AM CDT Thu Jun 13 2024

Valid 131300Z - 141200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON
AND EVENING OVER PORTIONS OF NORTHERN MISSOURI...SOUTHERN IOWA...AND
NORTHERN ILLINOIS...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are most likely across southern Iowa into
northern portions of Missouri and Illinois during the late afternoon
to early evening. Very large hail, destructive wind gusts, and a
couple tornadoes are possible.

...Great Lakes...
Morning water vapor imagery shows a progressive shortwave trough
over the Dakotas, with an associated cluster of showers and
thunderstorms over eastern SD.  This feature will track eastward
through the day, with large scale forcing for ascent overspreading
parts of southern WI/northern IL and Lower MI by early afternoon. 
Strong daytime heating in this area will likely result in
intensification of thunderstorms along an approaching cold front, in
an environment of steep low and mid level lapse rates and moderate
CAPE.  Activity will spread across Lake Michigan and southern Lower
MI through early evening with a risk of hail and damaging winds.

...Middle MS Valley...
The aforementioned surface cold front will extend southwestward
across southern IA and into northeast KS by mid afternoon.  Strong
daytime heating will yield afternoon temperatures in the upper 80s
to mid 90s ahead of the front, along with a corridor of dewpoints in
the mid-upper 60s.  Forecast soundings in this zone show large
MLCAPE values over 3000 J/kg along with steep low and mid level
lapse rates.  Convective initiation along the front may be delayed
until late afternoon or early evening due to warm temperatures in
the 800-700mb layer, but eventually discrete supercells are expected
to form along the front.  Storms will track east-southeastward
across the ENH risk area posing a risk of very large hail, damaging
winds, and perhaps a tornado or two.  Upscale organization into one
or more bowing structures is also expected this evening with an
increased risk of damaging winds.

...Western KS to TX Panhandle...
A hot and deeply mixed boundary layer will develop this afternoon
from the northeast TX Panhandle into western KS, with temperatures
over 100F.  Most CAM solutions suggest scattered coverage of
high-based thunderstorms in this region.  Forecast soundings show
inverted-v profiles, but also sufficient winds aloft to pose a risk
of locally damaging wind gusts for a few hours during the evening.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0400 AM CDT Wed Jun 12 2024

Valid 151200Z - 201200Z

...DISCUSSION...
...Saturday/Day 4 to Saturday/Day 5...
On Saturday, an upper-level trough is forecast to move northeastward
across the southern and central High Plains. An axis of instability
is forecast to be further to the northwest across the western
Dakotas. As a mid-level jet passes northeastward across the northern
Rockies, large-scale ascent and deep-layer shear should be strong
enough for an isolated severe thunderstorms in parts of the northern
High Plains. Large hail and severe wind gusts will be possible, but
uncertainty exists concerning the spatial distribution of the
threat.

The trough in the central Plains is forecast to move into the upper
Mississippi Valley on Sunday, with a large pocket of instability
located in its wake across the central Plains. Although large-scale
ascent within this unstable airmass is expected to be weak, isolated
severe storms could develop in the late afternoon and early evening.


Further to the northwest, model forecasts show potential for storm
development in parts of the northern High Plains Sunday evening. If
this were to occur, MCS development, and an isolated severe threat,
could occur across parts of the northern Plains Sunday night.

...Monday/Day 6 to Wednesday/Day 8...
On Monday, a mid-level jet is forecast to move northeastward into
the northern Plains, as a moist and unstable airmass remains in
place across the Upper Midwest. Severe thunderstorms may develop
across parts of the region during the afternoon and evening, in
association with any shortwave trough that can translate through the
flow. The models suggest there is enough potential on Monday for a
more widespread severe threat, to add a 15 percent contour in parts
of the eastern Dakotas and Minnesota.

On Tuesday, an upper-level trough is forecast to move across the
northern Plains. Isolated strong to severe thunderstorms would be
possible ahead of the trough in parts of the upper Mississippi
Valley. As the trough moves through southeastern Canada on
Wednesday, severe storms would be possible in parts of the
Northeast. However, uncertainty is considerable at this range in the
forecast period.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1056 AM CDT Mon Jun 10 2024

Valid 101700Z - 111200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast remains on track. Please see the discussion
below for additional meteorological details. In addition, breezy
northwest winds around 15-25 mph will develop this afternoon in and
around the Sacramento and San Andres Mountains of NM via a localized
tight pressure gradient. However, cooler temperatures will only
yield minimum RH of 25-35 percent within these regions, precluding
the need for an Elevated area.

..Barnes.. 06/10/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0142 AM CDT Mon Jun 10 2024/

...Synopsis...
A weak midlevel ridge will favor continued warm/dry conditions
across much of the Southwest, where fuels continue to dry. While
these warm/dry conditions will support locally elevated fire-weather
conditions, a weak pressure gradient should limit sustained surface
winds and the overall fire-weather threat.

Farther north, moderate midlevel westerly flow on the backside of a
shortwave trough will cross the northern Cascades. As a result,
locally dry/breezy conditions are possible within the Cascade gaps
over central WA and northern OR -- potentially yielding locally
elevated fire-weather conditions.
