Mesoscale Discussion 2202
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0837 AM CST Mon Nov 04 2024

Areas affected...central/eastern Oklahoma and north Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Tornado Watch likely 

Valid 041437Z - 041700Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...The severe/tornado threat is likely to increase by late
morning.

DISCUSSION...A very moist airmass is present from north Texas to
much of eastern Oklahoma with dewpoints in the upper 60s. This has
already yielded 1000 to 1500 J/kg MLCAPE with minimal surface
heating. Given the minimal inhibition (per SPC mesoanalysis and
regional 12Z RAOBs), expect widespread thunderstorm development by
late morning to early afternoon. Moderate instability and strong
shear will support supercells capable of all hazards. Parts of
central and south-central Oklahoma (near the I-35 corridor) have the
greatest uncertainty. Outflow from this mornings storms has advanced
east of I-35 with low 60s dewpoints and northerly/westerly flow.
However, strong, southerly flow is trying to stall this boundary and
lead to northward/westward airmass recovery within this corridor. 

A tornado watch will eventually be needed, but it is unclear whether
the threat will start to increase in the next 1 to 2 hours or closer
to mid-day when the primary ascent overspreads the region. Trends
will be monitored and a watch will be issued when an organized
severe threat appears imminent.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0653 AM CST Mon Nov 04 2024

Valid 041300Z - 051200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM PARTS OF
THE SOUTHERN PLAINS INTO THE OZARKS...

...SUMMARY...
Tornadoes (some strong), large hail, and severe thunderstorm gusts,
are expected today into tonight from the Southern Plains into the
Ozarks and mid Mississippi Valley.

...Synopsis...
A high-amplitude mid/upper-level pattern will continue over the
CONUS, dominated by a trough now located from a low over northern
SK, to eastern MT, central WY, western CO, through another low over
western NM south of GNT, and across western Chihuahua to the central
Mexican Pacific Coast.  A strong, basal shortwave trough was
apparent in moisture-channel imagery south through southwest of the
low, over the borderlands of southwestern NM and southern AZ.  As
the shortwave trough pivots around the broader-scale flow field
today -- across west TX to the South Plains/Permian Basin regions --
the low should shift eastward roughly along I-40 to near TCC, then
lose definition near the TX line around 00Z. By 12Z, the shortwave
trough should become positively tiled and extend from eastern KS
across southwestern OK to the lower Pecos Valley of west TX,
somewhat ahead of the synoptic-scale trough. 

At the surface, 11Z analysis showed an outflow-reinforced warm-
frontal zone over southwest, south-central and east-central OK,
moving slowly northward.  A surface low was drawn over west-central
TX near ABI, and is forecast to move northeastward along the
combined convective/outflow boundary today.  By 00Z, the low should
be near PNC, with cold front across south-central/southeastern OK,
then roughly down the I-35 corridor in TX.  The warm front should
extend from the low east-northeastward over central/northeastern MO.
By 12Z tomorrow, the low should reach the northern MO/southern IA
vicinity, with cold front to southeastern OK and east-central to
deep south TX.

...Southern Plains to mid Mississippi Valley...
A band of convection largely north of the warm front is moving
through central OK at this time, with marginal potential for severe
gusts or a tornado.  See SPC mesoscale discussion 2201 for near-term
details.

Convection farther south along/ahead of the cold front is expected
to gradually organize as a QLCS through the remainder of the
morning, including near the fresh convective boundary trailing the
ongoing activity over OK.  This should occur as the activity moves
obliquely across the warm front/outflow boundary preceding it, and
into a more-favorable, slowly northward-shifting boundary layer now
across southern OK and northwest/north-central TX.  Given the
supportive low-level and deep-layer shear (with effective-shear
magnitudes commonly 45-55 kt and 200-400 J/kg effective SRH),
embedded mesovortices with tornado potential should exist, as well
as the typical threat for severe gusts locally maximized near
LEWP/bow formations.  Due to the lack of a substantial EML and
related weak MLCINH in the free warm sector, gradual buildup of
convection is also expected ahead of the QLCS, with at least a few
warm-sector supercells ultimately evolving and interacting with the
outflow boundary.  These would pose a threat for a few tornadoes, as
well as large hail and damaging gusts, in an environment
characterized by upper 60s to low 70s F surface dewpoints, low LCL,
and enlarging hodographs. 

The severe threats with the QLCS and foregoing supercells should
shift eastward and northeastward across the outlook area through the
period, with the convective band sweeping up cells just ahead of it.
Meanwhile the warm front will shift northward to near or even a bit
north of the I-44 corridor in northeastern OK/MO.  Meanwhile
additional supercells may develop farther east in the northward-
expanding warm sector.  The most favorable parameter space for
tornadoes from all this activity should be this afternoon and
evening from south-central and eastern OK into the Ozarks of
southern MO and northwestern AR, with a relatively maximized risk of
significant (EF2+) tornado potential.  Forecast soundings reasonably
depict enlargement of the preconvective hodographs from late
afternoon into evening over this region, with around 30-kt shear
vectors and 150-200 J/kg SRH just in the lowest 1/2 km.  

The severe threat should persist into the mid Mississippi Valley
late tonight, gradually winding down as the projected inflow layer
becomes less unstable.  The eastern bound remains uncertain, but
somewhat more room has been added on the marginal outlook from IL-AR
to account for that uncertainty.  The backbuilding convective band
into north and central TX -- and the Arklatex tonight -- also will
pose a tornado and severe-gust threat, but with hodographs and deep
ascent somewhat weaker than farther north.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0741 PM CDT Sat Nov 02 2024

Valid 030100Z - 031200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM PARTS OF
SOUTHWEST TEXAS INTO CENTRAL OKLAHOMA...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong to severe storms will be possible through tonight,
primarily from the Permian Basin and South Plains into Oklahoma.

...Northwest TX into OK...
Scattered clusters of rain and storms persist this evening from
extreme southeast NM across the South Plains and into central OK.
The large-scale instability gradient currently extends south of the
aggregate outflow, roughly from Midland TX to Ardmore OK, with
1000-1500 J/kg MUCAPE to the south.  

Given the persistent southerly flow regime through tonight, a moist
and unstable air mass will likely spread north, with elevated
instability increasing over currently rain-cooled areas from
northwest TX into OK. 

In the near term, the greatest supercell threat will remain over the
Permian Basin, in closer proximity to the most unstable air, with
hail or brief tornado risk. With time, storms may tend to
consolidate just north of the instability gradient, with an
increasing low-level jet supporting locally damaging gusts. Ambient
SRH over 200 m2/s2 may also favor embedded circulations at times,
especially if the activity can consolidate into a squall line as
indicated by some models.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 698
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
230 PM CDT Sat Nov 2 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Southeast New Mexico
  West Texas

* Effective this Saturday afternoon and evening from 230 PM until
  900 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A couple tornadoes possible
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2.5
    inches in diameter possible
  Isolated damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...Isolated to scattered severe thunderstorms are forecast
this afternoon into the evening across the Permian Basin.  A few
supercells capable of large to very large hail (1 to 2.5 inches in
diameter) and severe gusts (60-70 mph) are expected.  As the
low-level winds strengthen late this afternoon into the early
evening, a risk for a couple of tornadoes may develop with the more
intense supercells to the south of and immediately near an outflow
boundary draped from west to east across the area.  Storms will
likely grow upscale into one or more small clusters later this
evening with severe wind and hail becoming the primary hazards.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 50 statute miles
north and south of a line from 10 miles southwest of Carlsbad NM to
40 miles northeast of Midland TX. For a complete depiction of the
watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU8).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 2.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 60 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean
storm motion vector 23025.
