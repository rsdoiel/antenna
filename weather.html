<br>development, locally heavy rainfall and gusty winds are possible
<br>across the northern Leeward Islands today.<br>* Formation chance
through 48 hours…low…20 percent. <br>* Formation chance through 7
days…low…20 percent.<br><br /> 2. Offshore the Southeastern U.S.:<br>A
non-tropical area of low pressure could form along a frontal

Tropical Storm Ileana Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092024
800 AM MST Fri Sep 13 2024
 
Recent satellite imagery shows that Ileana is producing a large
convective canopy with clouds top temperatures as cold as -80C.
However, data from the Mexican radar at Cabo San Lucas shows that
the convective banding under the canopy is poorly organized and
suggests that the circulation center is still broad and elongated.
The various satellite intensity estimates are little changed since
the previous advisory, so the initial intensity remains 40 kt.
 
The initial motion is 335/8 kt. This general motion should continue 
for the next 12 h or so, bringing the center across the southern 
portion of the Baja California peninsula later today and into the 
southern Gulf of California by early Saturday.  After that, a slower 
northward to north-northwestward motion is forecast until the 
cyclone dissipates over the weekend.  There are no significant 
changes to either the track forecast guidance and the forecast 
track.

Ileana currently appears too disorganized to take advantage of the 
current environment of light to moderate shear, good moisture, and 
warm water. Thus, little change in strength is expected before 
landfall in Baja California Sur.  When the cyclone reaches the Gulf 
of California, it is forecast to move into increasing westerly shear 
and a drier airmass, which should cause weakening despite the very 
warm sea surface temperatures.  Based on this scenario and the 
intensity guidance, the intensity forecast continues to show 
weakening, with the cyclone forecast to become a remnant low by 48 h 
and dissipate by 72 hr.


Key Messages:
 
1. Tropical Storm Ileana will bring heavy rainfall to portions of 
western Mexico and southern Baja California through this weekend. 
This heavy rainfall will bring a risk of flash flooding and 
mudslides to portions of the area.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin in portions of
Baja California Sur during the next several hours where Tropical 
Storm Warnings are in effect.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0743 AM CDT Fri Sep 13 2024

Valid 131300Z - 141200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM MIDDLE
TENNESSEE TO THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE...

...SUMMARY...
A marginal tornado threat is expected to develop this morning and
afternoon across parts of Alabama, western Georgia and middle
Tennessee.  Isolated damaging to severe gusts will be possible in
parts of Alabama, southwest Georgia and the Florida Panhandle.

...Synopsis...
In mid/upper levels, the CONUS portion of the large-scale pattern
this period will be characterized by a "dirty" Rex block in the
East, and troughing in the West.  The block will be composed of an
anticyclone drifting eastward over the Upper Great Lakes, and a
small, deep-layer cyclone -- resulting from the merger of a weak,
midlatitude, mid/upper-tropospheric low with the low/middle-level
remnants of post-tropical cyclone Francine -- centered currently
near BVX.  This low should weaken gradually and meander slowly over
the Mid-South, possibly drifting east-southeastward back across the
MEM area through the period, but with negligible movement on the
synoptic scale.

In the northern stream, a mid/upper-level cyclone -- evident in
moisture-channel imagery over southern SK -- will eject
northeastward to northern MB and devolve to an open-wave trough by
12Z tomorrow.  In its wake, broadly cyclonic flow aloft, with mostly
minor embedded shortwaves/vorticity maxima -- will cover the
northwestern 1/4 of the CONUS.  To its east, midlevel DCVA/ascent
from a weak trough trailing the cyclone, combined with low-level
warm advection and gradual moistening, will support general thunder
potential over portions of the northern Plains to upper Mississippi
Valley.

At the surface, 11Z analysis showed a wavy, quasistationary to warm
front extending from off the SC Coast across southern GA and 
eastern/northern AL, intersecting a weak cold front there, then as
an occluded front into the low over AR.  This boundary should drift
diffusely northward through the period, while weakening.  A
stationary to slow cold front was drawn from southern MB across
central ND and western SD, and should drift eastward over the
central Dakotas today through tonight.

...Southeast...
Isolated, mostly short-lived supercells will be possible today,
mainly in a belt of low-level convergence from parts of central/
eastern AL and western GA into the Tennessee Valley, with a marginal
tornado threat.  Farther south, in weaker shear (but greater
instability), a few of the stronger cells or small clusters may
produce damaging gusts.

A corridor of relatively maximized low-level shear/SRH remains near
the old, diffuse warm-frontal zone well southeast of the center of
Francine's remnants.  Both that and a moisture/buoyancy axis to its
west (centered roughly over the axis of the outlooked corridor)
should move little today, given the slow filling and lack of motion
of the related deep-layer cyclone over the Mid-South.  Rich low-
level moisture will persist in this corridor, with surface dewpoints
commonly in the 70s F, and low LCLs.  Weaknesses of both surface
winds and midlevel flow will sandwich a 35-40-kt east-southeasterly
to southeasterly LLJ that keeps hodographs somewhat enlarged and
effective SRH in the 150-300 J/kg range over eastern/northern AL
into southern mid TN.  With some localized help from boundaries
(outflow or differential-heating), a brief tornado is possible.  A
few of the most vigorous, water-loaded downdrafts will be capable of
localized strong to marginally severe gusts, especially over
southern areas where peak MLCAPE may reach about 2000 J/kg. 
Activity generally should weaken this evening and overnight as the
airmass stabilizes and the remnants of Francine continue to decay.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 669
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
550 AM CDT Thu Sep 12 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Southern Alabama
  Florida Panhandle
  Coastal Waters

* Effective this Thursday morning and afternoon from 550 AM until
  100 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A few tornadoes possible

SUMMARY...As Francine's center continues moving northward over MS
and weakens further through midday (per NHC forecast), a slot of
wind/moisture/instability fields favorable for supercells and a few
tornadoes will shift slowly northward/inland as well.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 60 statute miles
north and south of a line from 35 miles west southwest of Evergreen
AL to 35 miles south southeast of Marianna FL. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU9).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...This tornado watch replaces tornado
watch number 668. Watch number 668 will not be in effect after
550 AM CDT. 

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 0 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 50 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 450. Mean
storm motion vector 16030.

Mesoscale Discussion 2051
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0750 AM CDT Wed Sep 11 2024

Areas affected...southeastern Louisiana coastal areas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 111250Z - 111615Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...The risk for occasional tornadoes may begin to increase
near southeastern Louisiana coastal areas by late morning (10
AM-Noon).  Trends are being monitored for the possibility of a
tornado watch.

DISCUSSION...The center of Francine has been migrating across and
northeast of the Gunnison Oil Platform vicinity of the northwestern
Gulf of Mexico during the past hour or so, and is still roughly 170
miles from its forecast south central Louisiana coastal landfall
later today.  However, the leading edge of a broader convective
precipitation shield preceding Francine is beginning to overspread
coastal areas, accompanied by saturating thermodynamic profiles with
lapse rates trending moist adiabatic in mid-levels.

In the wake of this regime, and with the continued approach of
Francine, model forecast soundings suggest that a subtle increase in
boundary-layer temperatures and dew points may contribute to modest
destabilization by midday along coastal areas from west of
Boothville into the Vermilion Bay vicinity.  It appears that this
will coincide with more notable strengthening of low-level wind
fields, which are forecast to contribute to enlarging low-level
hodographs increasingly supportive of convection with embedded
low-level mesocyclones potentially capable of producing tornadoes.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0202 AM CDT Tue Sep 10 2024

Valid 111200Z - 121200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE GREAT BASIN...

...Synopsis...
The upper trough over the western US will quickly intensify
Wednesday, as a shortwave perturbation and mid-level jet streak move
onshore over the West Coast. As the trough strengthens, mid-level
flow over much of the West will increase. A surface low will deepen
over the northern Great Basin, while a cold front moves onshore and
also strengthens. To the east, TS Francine will approach the Gulf
Coast with offshore winds likely over parts of the mid South. Strong
surface winds, low humidity, and thunderstorms over parts of the
West and central US will support critical fire-weather concerns
Wednesday.

...Great Basin...
Ahead of the deepening trough, a potent mid-level jet streak will
move over parts of the western Great Basin beginning early
Wednesday. A deepening surface low in parts of the eastern Basin
will drive 20-25 mph winds over much of NV into western UT.
Augmented by downslope flow off the Sierra and the approaching cold
front, a brief period of winds of 25-30 mph will be possible along
with RH below 15%. Widespread critical fire-weather conditions are
likely over parts of the Great Basin. Fire-weather concerns should
diminish behind the front as cooler and more quiescent conditions
are expected behind the front into early Thursday.

...Lee of the Rockies and High Plains...
As the trough approaches, height falls and stronger flow aloft will
overspread the Rockies and High Plains. A surface low will deepen
first in eastern MT, with a lee trough extending south into the
central High Plains. Near the lee trough, strong southerly winds
will overlap with areas of low RH and drying fine fuels. Elevated
fire weather concerns are expected over parts of the High Plains
Wednesday afternoon and evening.

...Mid South...
As Francine approaches the Gulf Coast Wednesday and Wednesday night,
offshore pressure gradients will increase over parts of the lower MS
Valley and Mid South. While humidity values are not expected to be
overly low with the tropical air mass approaching, strong gusts are
expected to overlap with areas of relatively dry fuels and little
recent rainfall. Brief elevated fire-weather conditions are possible
before rain chances increase into early Thursday.

...Northwest Thunder...
Ahead of the cold front, increasing mid-level moisture and strong
lift from the trough will promote scattered thunderstorms Wednesday
afternoon. Lightning may interact with areas of somewhat drier fuels
over parts of the Northwest and northern Rockies before broader
wetting rainfall develops. However, these storms will likely have
higher precipitation efficiency with a cooler air mass and more
plentiful Pacific moisture in place. This lends significant
uncertainty on the threat for any lightning ignitions.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR PARTS OF THE
LA GULF COAST...

...SUMMARY...
Some tornado threat associated with Tropical Cyclone Francine may
approach the Louisiana Gulf Coast by early Wednesday morning.

...Synopsis...
Tropical Storm Francine will potentially intensify into a hurricane
as it moves north-northeastward across the western Gulf of Mexico.
Meanwhile, a strong mid/upper-level shortwave trough is forecast to
dig southeastward into the Pacific Northwest and northern CA.
Diurnal thunderstorms capable of locally gusty winds will be
possible from the eastern Great Basin into parts of the Rockies, and
also across the FL Peninsula. More isolated storms will also be
possible from the central Plains into the parts of the upper
Midwest, which may also be capable of locally gusty winds. Organized
severe-thunderstorm potential is expected to remain low, with the
possible exception of the LA Gulf Coast region late in the period in
association with Francine. 

...LA Gulf Coast vicinity...
Refer to NHC forecasts and advisories for more information regarding
Tropical Storm Francine. Based on the current forecast track, the
most favorable environment for low-topped supercells associated with
Francine should remain offshore for most of the forecast period.
However, some outer bands may begin to approach the LA Gulf Coast
prior to 12Z Wednesday morning, accompanied by an increase in
low-level shear/SRH. A small Marginal Risk has been included near
the immediate LA Gulf Coast for the potential of an increasing
tornado threat prior to the end of the forecast period.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0150 AM CDT Mon Sep 09 2024/

...Synopsis...
Broad trouhging over the Northwest should continue today as an
embedded perturbation moves eastward over the northern Rockies.
Southwesterly flow aloft is forecast to increase over much of the
West as the broad trough slowly shifts east. At the surface, a cold
front will move into the Rockies, bringing a cooler air mass to
parts of the Northwest, but gusty winds to parts of the Cascades. A
lee trough developing east of the Rockies will help support isolated
dry thunderstorms over parts of WY and MT. Periods of stronger
surface winds and low RH will support elevated to near-critical
fire-weather conditions.
 
...Northwest and Great Basin....
Stronger flow aloft is expected to persist today over much of the
Northwest and northern Great Basin. Surface winds should increase to
15-25 mph as momentum from aloft mixes down. Downsloping and
mid-level drying should keep the air mass quite dry with diurnal RH
minimums below 15% likely. Several hours of widespread elevated to
near-critical fire-weather conditions are likely across the northern
Sierra and Great Basin.

Farther north, more moderate RH of 25-30% is expected beneath the
upper trough and behind the cold front. Despite the arrival of a
cooler Pacific air mass, downslope winds of 15-25 mph should overlap
with dry fuels and pockets of lower RH during the day. Overlapping
with recent lightning and fire activity, a few hours of elevated to
near-critical conditions are possible in the lee of the Cascades as
winds increase.

...Northern Rockies...
Stronger westerly flow head of the embedded shortwave will aid in
deepening a lee trough east of the Rockies. Westerly surface winds
should strengthen in turn, supporting pockets of downslope winds of
15-25 mph across parts of MT and WY. With hot temperatures and
little recent rainfall, afternoon RH values should remain quite low,
generally below 20%. Increasing winds, receptive fuels, and
persistent dry conditions should support several hours of elevated
to near critical fire-weather conditions over parts of the northern
Rockies.

...Dry Thunder...
Isolated, high-based thunderstorms appear likely over parts of the
Rockies (mainly WY and MT) today ahead of the shortwave trough. Weak
buoyancy, and PWATs of 0.5 to 0.7 inches, atop dry and well-mixed
low levels will support poor precipitation efficiency and the
potential for strong outflow winds. At least isolated storms are
expected over areas of receptive fuels. Thus, dry lightning
ignitions are possible, especially across parts of north-central WY,
where storm coverage appears greatest.

Day 1 Convective Outlook

1126 AM CDT Mon Sep 09 2024

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
NEW YORK...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated damaging winds may occur this afternoon across parts of New
York.

...New York...
Within large-scale upper troughing over the Northeast and eastern
Canada, an embedded shortwave trough over southern Ontario and the
upper Great Lakes will continue to move across the Northeast this
afternoon and evening. Ascent associated with this shortwave trough
and related mid-level jet is supporting isolated thunderstorms
across southern Ontario and vicinity. This activity will spread
east-southeastward this afternoon across parts of NY. The airmass
over this region should become only weakly unstable as filtered
daytime heating occurs, with poor mid-level lapse rates, persistent
cloud cover, and modest low-level moisture limiting destabilization.
Still, gradually increasing west-northwesterly winds at low/mid
levels will foster around 25-35 kt of deep-layer shear. This should
support modest thunderstorm organization, with multicells/small
clusters potentially evolving along and downstream of Lake Ontario.
Isolated strong to damaging winds should be the main threat with
this convection as it moves across much of NY this afternoon and
early evening, before eventually weakening with eastward extent with
the loss of daytime heating.

...Northern/Central Rockies and High Plains...
Isolated to widely scattered thunderstorms should develop this
afternoon over portions of the northern/central Rockies as a weak
shortwave trough continues eastward. Low-level moisture and related
instability are both expected to remain rather meager into the High
Plains, which should limit updraft intensities. Still, isolated
strong/gusty winds may occur with this high-based activity across
parts of MT/WY where low-level lapse rates can become steepened.
Greater low-level moisture is present farther east into the Dakotas,
along/east of a weak surface low/trough. But, increasing
low/mid-level temperatures and a strong cap should generally inhibit
thunderstorm development through much of the day with eastward
extent across the northern/central Plains.
