Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0241 PM CST Mon Nov 18 2024

Valid 201200Z - 261200Z

Fire weather concerns will generally be minimal across much of the
country through the extended period, though regional concerns may
emerge across portions of the Plains mid-week. An active upper-level
regime will persist through the remainder of the week, characterized
by the amplification of the upper trough currently over the Pacific
Northwest in the wake of today's trough ejection into the Plains.
This regime will maintain an unseasonably strong (1000-1005 mb)
surface low across the broader Midwest/Great Lakes region, which
will support several days of windy conditions across the Plains,
Midwest, and the OH River Valley regions. Despite the windy
conditions, widespread rainfall will eliminate fuel concerns for
most locations with the exception of western NE/SD where the
probability of wetting rainfall through mid-week is low. Elsewhere,
upper ridging over the Four Corners and northern Rockies will help
maintain rain chances along the West coast, and dry, but relatively
calm, conditions across the Southwest and southern Plains through
next weekend. 

...D3/Wed - Western SD/NE...
Breezy gradient winds are expected again on D3/Wednesday across much
of the Plains. While the strongest winds are expected to reside
across the central Dakotas into the lower MO River Valley, portions
of western SD/NE will likely see 15-20 mph winds. Relative humidity
values are expected to remain somewhat marginal (generally in the
25-35% range) due to cool temperatures, but may fall to near 20% for
some locations. Additionally, recent reports suggest fine fuels are
sufficiently dry to support fire spread. While critical conditions
are possible, the general expectation is for areas of elevated
wind/RH conditions during peak heating hours. Areas further north
and east where winds will be strongest should see limited fire
concerns given recent and/or anticipated precipitation over the next
48 hours.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0200 PM CST Mon Nov 18 2024

Valid 182000Z - 191200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS OF
EASTERN TEXAS AND LOUISIANA...

...SUMMARY...
A risk for a couple of tornadoes and damaging winds is forecast into
this evening from parts of east Texas into Louisiana and the central
Plains this evening.

...20z Update...
Across portions of eastern TX and western LA, scattered cloud breaks
and low-level warm advection are supporting destabilization along
and ahead of the main frontal precipitation band. As the front
continues east, updrafts along the front should strengthen, with
gradual storm development in the form of a QLCS. Ahead of the front,
the latest forecast guidance also shows a couple of more discrete
updrafts may eventually mature as temperatures warm. With strong
deep-layer shear in place, storm organization into supercells
capable of damaging gusts and a couple tornadoes is possible.

Across portions of northeast LA and southern MS, buoyancy remains
fairly limited. However, as the front/QLCS approaches, a few
stronger updrafts may persist. Given the strong low-level shear,
damaging gusts and a tornado or two will be possible into this
evening, though the magnitude and coverage of the threat remain
unclear.

...Central Plains and MO Valley...
Widespread cloud cover and precipitation have been slow to erode
ahead of the mid-level dryslot associated with the advancing
mid-level trough. While buoyancy is expected to remain very weak
(~300-500 J/kg of low-level MUCAPE), recent radar and satellite
imagery show low-topped convective bands have emerged in a narrow
area of cloud-breaks over south-central KS. Weak heating and dynamic
cooling beneath the upper trough could support enough buoyancy for
low-topped thunderstorms capable of isolated damaging gusts or a
brief tornado through the remainder of this afternoon.

..Lyons.. 11/18/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1025 AM CST Mon Nov 18 2024/

...East Texas into the Lower Mississippi Valley...
Water-vapor imagery late this morning shows a negatively tilted
mid-level trough over the southern High Plains rapidly moving
northeast, and this feature will reach the Upper Midwest by early
Tuesday morning.  The southern portion of an ongoing convective line
may continue to weaken across eastern/northeastern TX through the
early afternoon.  Models continue to suggest a risk for pre-squall
line updrafts developing in the warm sector this afternoon from east
TX into LA where MLCAPE may reach up to 500-1000 J/kg with daytime
heating.  Mid-level lapse rates will remain poor and the stronger
forcing for ascent will gradually become displaced by late afternoon
across this region.  However, strong flow fields will support a risk
for supercells with the stronger updrafts that develop.  Uncertainty
remains regarding the overall coverage (isolated) of potential
supercells and their associated severe risk.  Have left this portion
of the outlook area unchanged.

...Central Plains/Ozarks into the Mid Missouri Valley...
Morning surface analysis places a low over northwest OK with the
zone of strongest pressure falls extending northeast into northeast
KS where the low is forecast to track later today.  A mid-level
dryslot over the southern Great Plains will continue to shift
northeastward into KS this afternoon and aid in some weak
surface-based destabilization.  

In wake of morning showers/thunderstorms over KS, it remains
possible sufficient weak destabilization occurs by mid-late
afternoon immediately ahead of the low from central KS and quickly
spreading northeastward into the MO Valley.  Confidence is reserved
regarding overall coverage of robust storm development due in part
to extensive low cloud cover inhibiting destabilization, but it
seems possible a couple of strong to severe thunderstorms may
develop and yield an isolated risk for gusty winds and perhaps a
tornado.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR PORTIONS OF
THE CAROLINAS...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe storms may develop on Wednesday across parts of the
Carolinas, posing a risk for severe wind gusts.

...Carolinas...
A large mid-level trough will advance east and start to overspread
the Appalachians on Wednesday. Lee troughing will sharpen the
surface cold front as it moves across the Carolinas. Dewpoints are
expected to be in the mid 60s ahead of this front as far north as
southern/central North Carolina which, when combined with some weak
surface heating, should result in modest destabilization. Mid-level
flow will strengthen to around 50 knots by 00Z which will lead to
strong shear and the potential for a few organized storms along the
front during the afternoon. Damaging wind gusts will be the primary
threat given the veered low-level flow and only modest instability. 


...Pacific Northwest Coast...
A few strong storms are possible early Wednesday across the Pacific
Northwest coast as cold air overspreads relatively warm ocean
waters. The greatest instability will be during the morning to early
afternoon when some stronger storms could have gusty winds along the
coast.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1258 PM CST Mon Nov 18 2024

Valid 191200Z - 201200Z

An Elevated risk area has been introduced to portions of western to
central SD/NE. Westerly gradient winds are expected to increase to
15-25 mph (gusting between 25-40 mph) by late afternoon as the
surface low over the southern Plains migrates into the upper MS
River Valley. While RH values will remain somewhat marginal
(generally between 25-35%), fuel reports from local NWS offices and
land agencies suggest fine fuels may support fire spread. Hence, a
wind-driven Elevated risk area has been added to highlight the best
overlap of dry fuels and strong winds. Forecast details regarding
the southern CA coast remain on track as outlined in the discussion
below.

..Moore.. 11/18/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1256 AM CST Mon Nov 18 2024/

...Synopsis...
A surface high pressure system will be most intense on Tuesday
morning within the southern Great Basin. An increase in offshore
winds in southern California can be expected during the morning into
perhaps the early afternoon. The pressure gradient is expected to
weaken through the day and upper-level winds will not be overly
favorable as well. RH of 15-20% does appear probable, at least in
the immediate lee of the terrain. With the strongest winds being
somewhat offset from the lowest RH, the overall fire weather threat
should be somewhat brief. Elevated fire weather is expected to
occur, particularly within the terrain-favored areas.

Valid 181300Z - 191200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE SOUTHERN PLAINS...AND FROM PORTIONS OF EAST TEXAS INTO LOUISIANA
AND FAR SOUTHERN ARKANSAS...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms may continue to produce occasional strong to severe
gusts and perhaps a couple brief tornadoes across parts of north
Texas into central Oklahoma this morning. A threat for a few
tornadoes and damaging winds will also exist this afternoon and
evening from parts of east Texas into Louisiana and vicinity.

...Synopsis...
A negatively tilted shortwave trough over the southern High Plains
this morning will eject northeastward across the central Plains and
mid MO Valley through this evening. Attendant 80-100 kt mid-level
jet will likewise overspread OK/KS into western MO by late
afternoon, while a strong (50-60+ kt) southerly low-level jet aids
in northward moisture transport across parts of the southern/central
Plains and lower/mid MS Valley. At the surface, a deep low over
western OK will develop northeastward through the day in tandem with
the ejecting shortwave trough, eventually reaching the Upper Midwest
late tonight. A related cold front will sweep quickly eastward
across the southern/central Plains and into the mid MS Valley
through the period, before decelerating over the lower MS Valley
late tonight into early Tuesday morning.

...Southern Plains...
With low-level winds remaining very strong per area VWPs (up to
50-60 kt at 1 km AGL), an ongoing QLCS across central/southern OK
into north-central TX may continue to pose a risk for occasional
strong to severe winds in the short term this morning as it moves
east-northeastward. Ample low-level shear will also support a
continued threat for embedded circulations and a couple brief QLCS
tornadoes this morning. This line is expected to outpace better
low-level moisture return and already weak instability in the next
couple of hours (see very weak surface-based instability in 12Z
soundings from OUN/FWD). Accordingly, nearly all guidance shows
gradual weakening of the line over the next several hours as it
moves into eastern OK and northeast TX. Still, at least an isolated
threat for strong to damaging winds and perhaps a tornado could
persist, even as the thermodynamic environment becomes increasingly
marginal with eastward extent.

...East Texas into the Lower Mississippi Valley...
The southern portion of the squall line along/ahead of the cold
front should tend to remain weak through early afternoon, before
potentially restrengthening by mid/late afternoon into the early
evening. This should occur as the line/cold front encounters a more
buoyant airmass across parts of east TX into LA and southern AR,
where MLCAPE may reach up to 500-1000 J/kg with daytime heating,
even though mid-level lapse rates will remain poor. This region will
remain displaced well south of better forcing associated with the
ejecting shortwave trough. Even so, strengthening mid-level
southwesterly flow through the day will support 40-50 kt of
deep-layer shear and some threat for supercells ahead of the front.
Sufficient southerly low-level winds will also support adequate 0-1
km shear and a threat for a few tornadoes. Most high-resolution
guidance shows either the line restrengthening and/or supercells
developing ahead of it by late afternoon. Have therefore included a
Slight Risk from parts of east TX into LA and vicinity to account
for this potential.

...Central Plains/Ozarks into the Mid Missouri Valley...
Later today, a secondary area of thunderstorms may form closer to
the surface low and behind the initial QLCS from north-central OK
into central/eastern KS and eventually the mid MO Valley. This
convection may develop in a modestly steep mid-level lapse rate
environment amid more unidirectional southwesterly deep-layer flow
near the exit region of the mid-level jet. Even though instability
will remain weak, a couple of strong to severe thunderstorms may
pose an isolated risk for gusty winds, a tornado, and perhaps
marginally severe hail. Based on latest guidance trends, have
expanded the Marginal Risk northward some to include parts of the
mid MO Valley.
