NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0655 AM CST Fri Jan 03 2025

Valid 031300Z - 041200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Sporadic lightning flashes may occur this afternoon and evening over
parts of the coastal Pacific Northwest and northern California.
Severe thunderstorms are not expected.

...Synopsis and Discussion...
A strong upper trough will move inland today across the Northwest.
Cold mid-level temperatures (around -24 to -28 C at 500 mb)
associated with the trough, along with modestly steepened lapse
rates aloft, should support the development of weak instability even
though daytime heating will be muted by persistent cloud cover.
Behind a cold front, isolated lightning flashes may occur with
generally low-topped cells mainly this afternoon and evening along
parts of the OR Coast into northern CA. Small hail and gusty winds
may occur with the more robust cores, although limited forecast
instability and deep-layer shear are expected to preclude a
meaningful threat for severe thunderstorms.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0256 PM CST Thu Jan 02 2025

Valid 041200Z - 101200Z

A progressive upper pattern will prevail over the CONUS this weekend
into next week, resulting in rapid surface low development over the
Plains this weekend, followed by widespread surface high pressure
and colder air overspreading most of the CONUS through the week.
Behind the surface low, downslope flow along the lee of the southern
Rockies will promote dry and windy conditions amid drying fuels over
southern High Plains on Day 3 (Saturday), where 70 percent Critical
probabilities have been introduced. 

After surface high pressure becomes fortified across the Great Basin
and points east next week, a pressure gradient will become
established across southern California in the Days 6-8
(Tuesday-Thursday) period. Dry offshore flow atop dry fuels will
promote wildfire-spread potential to some degree. There is some
variability in medium-rage guidance as to when the best upper-level
support will overspread southern California to promote strong to
damaging offshore winds. However, there is enough agreement among
guidance members in strong, dry offshore flow on Days 6-8
(Tuesday-Thursday) to warrant 40 percent Critical probabilities. As
more guidance becomes available and the timing of maximum upper
support becomes clearer, Critical probabilities may need to be
adjusted Tuesday through Thursday, with the possibility of higher
Critical probabilities being needed as well.

...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms are not expected through tonight.

...Synopsis...

Thunderstorms are not expected to remainder of today/tonight given
dry and stable conditions across much of the country. No changes are
needed with the 20z update.

..Leitman.. 01/02/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1021 AM CST Thu Jan 02 2025/

...Synopsis...
In the mid levels, The general pattern is forecast to slowly amplify
as weak troughing with broad cyclonic flow will persist over the
eastern 2/3rds of the CONUS. At the same time, ridging will
intensify over the West. This will favor increasingly strong (80-100
kts) northwesterly flow over the central US. As a result, strong
high pressure at the surface is expected over the northern Plains
and Southeast. With cold temperatures and dry/stable offshore flow,
little to no buoyancy is expected inland, aside from extreme
southern/coastal TX. This will suppress thunderstorm potential below
10% coverage.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0125 PM CST Thu Jan 02 2025

Valid 041200Z - 051200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated thunderstorms are possible Sunday morning from far
northwest Texas across central Oklahoma into southeast Kansas.

...Synopsis...
As the upper trough over the Northeast slowly lifts/weakens, a
potent shortwave trough will move rapidly from the Great Basin
Saturday morning and across the central Plains into early Sunday.
High pressure will remain entrenched from the northern Plains into
the Southeast, but low pressure will develop over the southern High
Plains late in the day, moving into OK by 12Z Sunday.

Increasing southerly winds in the low levels will bring a plume of
50s F dewpoints northward across TX and toward the low over OK
Sunday morning. At that time, a warm front will generally extend
from the low southeastward into central MS.

Several hundred J/kg of MUCAPE may eventually develop, most likely
from OK toward the ArkLaTex. Although moistening, the boundary layer
may remain capped over most areas, with the highest probability of
elevated thunderstorms near the low and north of the warm front.
Given the small window in time and space for uncapped surface-based
parcel potential, the presence of strong shear should be moot, and
severe storms are not expected.

0103 PM CST Thu Jan 02 2025

Valid 031200Z - 041200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

Latest guidance consensus shows some modestly dry and breezy
conditions along the coastal Carolinas tomorrow (Friday) afternoon
with the passage of a cold front. However, the marginally dry/breezy
conditions, along with modest fuel receptiveness, suggests that any
wildfire-spread threat that materializes should remain localized.
Otherwise, the previous forecast remains on track.

..Squitieri.. 01/02/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0128 AM CST Thu Jan 02 2025/

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns should be minimal through the forecast period.
A deep long-wave trough will be located across the eastern US, with
a full latitude CONUS ridge over the Rockies. Although a sharp
trough will approach the California coast, winds across southern
California will turn more onshore, increasing relative humidity and
ending the recent offshore wind event.

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Sporadic lightning flashes may occur Friday afternoon and evening
over the coastal Pacific Northwest. Severe weather is not expected.

...Synopsis...
The pattern on Friday will feature an upper trough over the eastern
CONUS, with a western ridge breaking down late. The shortwave trough
responsible for the ridge breakdown will provide rapid cooling aloft
late in the day from northern CA into western WA and OR, and
overnight across the Great Basin. Given favorable diurnal
timing/steepening lapse rates, a few lightning flashes with
low-topped convection is possible near coastal counties as a cold
front approaches. 

Elsewhere, high pressure will maintain dry and/or stable conditions
over land. A few thunderstorms may occur over the northwest Gulf of
Mexico with a weak low well offshore.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0128 AM CST Thu Jan 02 2025/

...Synopsis...
Elevated fire weather conditions should be ongoing across
terrain-favored areas of southern California. The favorable offshore
wind surface-pressure gradient should hold on a little longer today
than previously expected, resulting in elevated fire weather
conditions lasting into and perhaps through the day -- especially in
terrain-favored areas. Here, winds may gust to near 30 mph and
relative humidity may fall into the upper single digits. Late in the
forecast period, winds may begin to turn more toward the southwest
as a mid-level trough approaches the California coast. As the winds
switch to the southwest, an inland surge of higher humidity should
bring to an end this offshore wind event.

PUBLIC SEVERE WEATHER OUTLOOK  
NWS STORM PREDICTION CENTER NORMAN OK
0715 PM CST SAT DEC 28 2024

...Severe thunderstorms expected over parts of the Gulf Coast States
this evening and overnight...

* LOCATIONS...
  Central and Southern Mississippi
  Western and Central Alabama
  Southeast Louisiana

* HAZARDS...
  Widespread damaging winds, some hurricane force
  Several tornadoes, a few intense
  Isolated large hail

* SUMMARY...
  Tornadoes (some strong with at least EF-2 damage possible) and
  numerous severe/damaging wind gusts are expected this evening
  through tonight. The threat area will shift eastward across
  parts of the lower Mississippi Valley this evening, and continue
  overnight through early Sunday morning over portions of the
  Tennessee Valley, central Gulf Coast states, and western
  Georgia.

Preparedness actions...

Tornadoes at night can be particularly dangerous because they 
are usually fast-moving and difficult to see. Stay tuned to
NOAA Weather Radio, weather.gov, or other media for watches and
warnings. A tornado watch means that conditions are favorable
for tornadoes to form during the next several hours. If a tornado
warning is issued for your area, move to a place of safety,
ideally in a basement or interior room on the lowest floor of a
sturdy building.
