Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0656 AM CST Thu Jan 16 2025

Valid 161300Z - 171200Z

...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms are not expected today or tonight.

...Discussion...
An eastward-progressive upper trough will influence the Eastern
Seaboard and western Atlantic, with high pressure and continental
trajectories pervasive east of the Rockies. An upper low off the
coast of southern California and northern Baja will begin to shift
toward the Southwest Deserts late today and tonight. Isolated weak
convection may occur tonight across parts of central/southeast
Arizona, but cool/dry thermodynamic profiles are not expected to be
overly conducive for lightning.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0147 AM CST Wed Jan 15 2025

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

...Synopsis...
The surface high pressure gradient should begin to relax, with
offshore flow gradually diminishing as the mid-level cutoff low
morphs into an open wave and overspreads the Baja Peninsula tomorrow
(Thursday). Before the pressure gradient weakens though, at least a
few more hours of dry and breezy offshore flow will persist in
terrain-favoring areas surrounding the Los Angeles metropolitan
area, with Elevated highlights introduced.

...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms are not expected through tonight.

...20z Update...
The previous forecast remains on track with no changes required.
Thunderstorm potential remains very limited across the CONUS with
only a low chance of a lightning flash or two off the far southern
TX coast early Wednesday. See the previous discussion for additional
details.

..Moore.. 01/14/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1010 AM CST Tue Jan 14 2025/

...Synopsis and Discussion...
Expansive surface high pressure will continue to dominate much of
the CONUS through the period, with minimal thunderstorm potential.
Weak low-level warm/moist advection is forecast to occur tonight
across parts of deep south TX. While modest MUCAPE should eventually
develop over this region, limited large-scale ascent suggests
thunderstorm chances should remain low.

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms are not expected on Thursday.

...Discussion...
An upper trough will shift steadily across the eastern half of the
U.S. Thursday, while the next feature -- an energetic short-wave
trough digging southeastward out of western Canada -- reaches the
northern Intermountain Region/northern Plains late.

As this feature advances, a deepening surface cyclone is forecast to
shift eastward across the Canadian Prairie Provinces, while a
trailing Arctic cold front progresses southward across the northern
Rockies/northern Plains Thursday night.  

Meanwhile, with cold/dry low-level air already in place across the
U.S., thunderstorms are not anticipated.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1114 AM CST Tue Jan 14 2025

Valid 151200Z - 161200Z

...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Minimal to no lightning is expected across the U.S. on Wednesday.

...Discussion...
A mid-level short-wave trough moving southeastward across the Plains
states Wednesday will contribute to amplification of the broader
troughing/cyclonic flow over the eastern U.S. through the period. 
As this occurs, surface high pressure representing cold/dry
continental air will prevail across much of the country through
Thursday morning.  

Given the cool/dry/stable air dominating the country, thunderstorms
are largely precluded.  An exception will be over coastal South
Texas, where weak CAPE atop a deep/stable boundary layer will
support scattered showers, and potentially a few lightning flashes. 
However, with coverage of any lightning still expected to remain
quite limited, no thunder area will be added at this time.

Valid 141700Z - 151200Z

...EXTREMELY CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE WESTERN
LA BASIN...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR MUCH OF SOUTHERN CA...

...17z Update...
Morning obs show offshore flow has been slow to develop across
western Ventura and LA Counties. Stronger gusts of 50-60 mph were
noted in the western San Gabriel mountains, and should become more
common across the higher terrain through the afternoon. As
mechanical mixing increases with diurnal heating, stronger winds
should also develop across much of southern CA. Sustained 20-30 mph
winds with RH below 20% is expected across the Ventura Plain and
interior Valleys this afternoon, as upper-level winds become aligned
with offshore gradients. This should promote several hours of
high-end critical to localized extremely critical conditions through
terrain-favored corridors. Critical fire concern should continue
overnight as winds strengthen again into early D2/Wed morning. The
prior outlook area is unchanged, see the previous discussion for
more info.

..Lyons.. 01/14/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0152 AM CST Tue Jan 14 2025/

...Synopsis...
A belt of stronger northeasterly mid-level flow will overspread
southern California as a 500 mb cut-off low attempts to drift
southwest from the coastline today. A localized tightening of the
surface pressure gradient is likely during the morning hours,
encouraging very strong, dry offshore flow from the Ventura Valley
to the Laguna Mountains. Widespread 20-30 mph sustained offshore
winds are likely (perhaps with gusts exceeding 50 mph at times) for
much of the period, warranting the maintenance of Critical
highlights. Similar to yesterday, the best chance for sustained
30-40 mph winds amid 10 percent RH will be from around the Ventura
Valley to the San Bernardino Mountains. Here, Extremely Critical
highlights remain given the potential for very dangerous
wildfire-spread conditions and the potential for extreme fire
behavior.
