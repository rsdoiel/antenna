Potential Tropical Cyclone Five-E Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052025
300 PM CST Mon Jun 16 2025
 
Showers and thunderstorms associated with a broad area of low 
pressure located a couple of hundred miles south of the coast of 
Guatemala have increased in organization over the past couple of 
days.  Visible satellite imagery shows an exposed elongated 
low-level center south of a burst of modest convective activity.  
The initial intensity is set to 30 kt based on a partial overpass of 
satellite scatterometer data.  Since the system is expected to 
develop and affect southern Mexico late Wednesday or Thursday, 
advisories have been initiated on Potential Tropical Cyclone Five.

The initial motion is estimated to be 295/7 kt, but this is 
uncertain due to the lack of a defined core.  The low is moving 
along the western periphery of a ridge centered over the 
southwestern Atlantic, and this feature should control the motion of 
the system for the entirety of the forecast period.  Most global and 
regional models predict the low will turn toward the northwest later 
today or tonight, and that motion should persist for the next few 
days.  There is noticeable spread in the along-track speed of the 
system among the various models.  The GFS and some of the regional 
models show a slower motion while the ECMWF and HCCA anticipate a 
quicker forward speed.  The NHC forecast track lies closest to a 
blend of the GFS and the ECMWF, near the center of the guidance 
envelope.

The low should remain over an area of very warm waters and within a 
conducive environment for strengthening.  SHIPS-EC shows a 50 
percent chance of 55 kt of strengthening in 48 hr, which highlights 
the possibility of rapid intensification in the coming days.  The 
official forecast predicts the disturbance will become a tropical 
storm in about a day and a hurricane in a couple of days.  The NHC 
forecast lies near the higher end of the intensity guidance 
envelope.  This system is expected to bring significant winds upon 
landfall in southern Mexico in the next few days or so.  However, it 
is important to note that uncertainty remains high in the exact 
location of potential impacts, and interests in southern Mexico 
should closely monitor the latest forecasts.  

NHC now has the ability to issue tropical cyclone advisory products 
for Potential Tropical Cyclones up to 72 hours before the 
anticipated arrival of tropical-storm-force winds on land when 
confidence is high that there is a significant risk of wind or storm 
surge impacts to land, regardless of the immediate need for 
land-based hurricane or tropical storm watches or warnings,   
Previously, Potential Tropical Cyclone advisories could be issued up 
to 48 hours beforehand.   Appropriate watches and warnings will 
still be issued 48 and 36 hours, respectively, before the onset of 
tropical-storm-force winds.

KEY MESSAGES:

1. The disturbance is expected to become a tropical storm on Tuesday 
and quickly strengthen into a hurricane by Wednesday as it 
approaches southern Mexico.  Hurricane watches will likely be 
required for portions of southern Mexico tonight or early Tuesday.. 

2. The system will likely produce heavy rainfall across portions of 
Central America and southern Mexico through this week.  
Life-threatening flooding and mudslides are possible, especially in 
areas of steep terrain.

Mesoscale Discussion 1314
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0349 PM CDT Mon Jun 16 2025

Areas affected...east-central to northern MN

Concerning...Tornado Watch 423...

Valid 162049Z - 162215Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 423 continues.

SUMMARY...The severe threat should increase into early evening as
additional storms develop southward in central Minnesota and spread
east.

DISCUSSION...Initially low-topped convection has gradually deepened
over the past hour. Cells near the surface cyclone in west-central
MN have mainly had a brief tornado threat thus far. But an arcing
line of towering CU towards Willmar ahead of the surface cold front
suggests additional storms should form into the instability axis
characterized by moderate buoyancy with MLCAPE of 1500-2500 J/kg.
This activity should intensify into early evening and support a more
sustained severe threat beyond brief tornadoes. The overall severe
threat may peak into early evening with any sustained supercells
that can interact with residual outflow from storms that have spread
into west-central WI. MPX VWP data has sampled enhanced low-level
SRH near this outflow.

Mesoscale Discussion 1313
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0253 PM CDT Mon Jun 16 2025

Areas affected...Parts of southern Montana into far northern Wyoming

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 161953Z - 162200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Widely scattered storms are possible southern
Montana/northern Wyoming. Supercells capable of large hail and
severe winds are expected. Though timing is uncertain, a watch is
possible this afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Modestly moist upslope flow and an approaching
mid-level trough have promoted thunderstorm development within the
terrain of south-central Montana. This has occurred north of a band
of cirrus over much of Wyoming. While these storms have been slow to
intensify, continued surface heating this afternoon will increase
MLCAPE values to over 1000 J/kg. Effective shear of 45-55 kts will
help to organize convection into supercells capable of large hail
and severe wind gusts. Even with the approaching trough, mid-level
height falls will generally remain neutral until later in the
evening. It is not clear what storm coverage will be, but at least
widely scattered storms are possible with additional development
occurring in northern Wyoming near the Big Horns. Another point of
uncertainty is how far south/east activity will go given greater
inhibition underneath the cirrus canopy.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 423
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
255 PM CDT Mon Jun 16 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Central Minnesota
  Western Wisconsin

* Effective this Monday afternoon and evening from 255 PM until
  900 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A couple tornadoes possible
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2.5
    inches in diameter likely
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph likely

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms will intensify this afternoon near a cold
front sweeping eastward across the Minnesota, with a few supercells
expected.  Large hail is the main concern, but the strongest storms
may also pose a risk of damaging winds and a few tornadoes.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 70 statute miles
north and south of a line from 20 miles west of Alexandria MN to 80
miles northeast of Minneapolis MN. For a complete depiction of the
watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU3).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 2.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 60 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean
storm motion vector 27030.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0300 PM CDT Mon Jun 16 2025

Valid 171200Z - 181200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR FAR EASTERN ARIZONA AND WESTERN
NEW MEXICO...

An upper-level short wave trough and increased mid-level winds will
continue to bring Elevated to Critical fire weather conditions to
the portions of the Southwest Tuesday. Latest model guidance
consensus shows a slight northeastward push of stronger
west-northwest winds into northwestern New Mexico for Tuesday.
Sustained wind speeds of 15-25 mph combined with RH below 10 percent
will promote Critical fire weather conditions within dry fuels.
Critical highlights were nudged northward to cover this fire weather
threat. Otherwise, previous forecast remains on track.

..Williams.. 06/16/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0159 AM CDT Mon Jun 16 2025/

...Synopsis...
Within the base of a midlevel trough advancing eastward from the
Great Basin into the central Rockies, moderate deep-layer westerly
flow will overspread the Southwest during the afternoon. In response
to this feature, a lee cyclone will deepen over the central High
Plains. 

...Western NM and Eastern AZ...
Deep boundary-layer mixing into the enhanced flow aloft, coupled
with a tightening pressure gradient peripheral to the deepening lee
cyclone, will contribute to an expansive area of single-digit RH and
20 mph sustained westerly surface winds across western NM and
eastern AZ. These dry/windy conditions atop increasingly dry fuels
will lead to critical fire-weather conditions during the afternoon.

Valid 162000Z - 171200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON
AND EVENING OVER PARTS OF NEBRASKA AND PARTS OF MINNESOTA...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms capable of producing severe/damaging
gusts, large to very large hail, and a few tornadoes are forecast
today across parts of the northern/central Plains into the Upper
Mississippi Valley.

...20z Update...
Only minor adjustments were made to trim probabilities behind the
low/cold front in the Midwest and northern Plains. Otherwise, the
forecast remains on track with no large changes needed. 

Scattered thunderstorm activity is expected to intensify across
portions of MN/IA this afternoon, with potential for damaging winds,
large hail, and a couple of tornadoes. See MCD#1311 for additional
information.

Across the northern Plains, a couple of supercells have developed in
southeastern SD producing a few instances of severe hail. Additional
development is expected across portions of NE/KS this afternoon,
with potential for large to very large hail and damaging winds. See
previous discussion of more information.

..Thornton.. 06/16/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1125 AM CDT Mon Jun 16 2025/

...MN/IA...
Morning water vapor imagery shows a shortwave trough over the
eastern Dakotas.  As this trough moves eastward this afternoon, a
surface low will deepen over central MN with a trailing cold front
sweeping across the state.  Morning convection is getting out of the
way, which should allow several hours of strong
heating/destabilization.  Afternoon MLCAPE values of 3000+ J/kg are
expected, with little inhibition.  This should lead to rapid
thunderstorm development by mid-afternoon near the surface low, with
at least widely scattered development southward along the cold front
into northern IA.  Low-level winds are somewhat veered but strong. 
This coupled with favorable westerly flow aloft should promote a few
supercells capable of large hail and damaging winds.  A tornado or
two is also possible.

...NE/KS...
The aforementioned cold front will sag southward into northern NE by
early evening.  A strong southerly low-level jet south of the front,
along with steep mid-level lapse rates and large CAPE, will promote
the development of scattered intense storms along the front. 
Supercells capable of very large hail and damaging winds are
expected, along with perhaps a tornado.  Congealing outflows from
high-based convection are expected to move into the region during
the mid-evening from the west, resulting in upscale convective
growth and an increasing risk of damaging winds.

...MS/AL...
Strong heating is occurring today across much of MS and western AL,
where dewpoints are in the mid 70s.  Clusters of thunderstorms are
forming over LA, which are expected to propagate northeastward
across the region through the day.  Steep low-level lapse rates,
large CAPE, and relatively strong ambient low-level wind fields will
pose some of risk of gusty/damaging wind gusts in the strongest
cells today.

into Lower MI. A surface low is expected from eastern IA into lower
MI during the day, with a trough extending southwestward across IL,
MO, and OK. A very moist and unstable air mass will exist ahead of
this main front with upper 60s to lower 70s F dewpoints.

To the east, a weak surface trough is forecast to develop over the
Mid Atlantic, where strong heating will lead to an unstable air mass
beneath modest southwest flow aloft around western Atlantic high.

...MI southwestward into OK...
Scattered storms may be ongoing Wednesday morning from IA into MO
and northeast OK, with remnant MCS activity. It appears the greatest
ascent will move across northern areas coincident with the shortwave
trough, from northern IL into lower MI. Here, shear profiles will
likely support supercells, including hail and perhaps tornado
threat. 

Farther south, stronger instability and PWAT will exist along the
front but with weaker shear. Substantial convection is expected with
areas of damaging winds likely. Some of these storms may move south
to southwest due to propagation. Given steep midlevel lapse rates,
sporadic hail may occur as well.

...Eastern PA and MD...NJ...DE...
Moderate instability is forecast to develop around the DelMarVa and
into eastern PA and NJ, with primarily tall/moist CAPE profiles as
seen on forecast soundings. Sufficient surface convergence is likely
to initiate scattered storms during the afternoon from eastern PA
into eastern MD, moving across NJ and DE by late afternoon/early
evening. Given the favorable time of day, high PWAT and modest
westerly flow aloft, some of these storms may produce locally
damaging gusts, and perhaps small to marginal hail.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1228 PM CDT Mon Jun 16 2025

Valid 171200Z - 181200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER MUCH OF
KANSAS AND INTO WESTERN MISSOURI...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms producing damaging winds, hail, and possibly a
few tornadoes are expected Tuesday across parts of the central
Plains and lower to mid Missouri Valley. Outside of this area,
marginally severe storms will be possible across a large part of the
central U.S. Storms with isolated severe winds gusts may develop in
parts of the central Appalachians and Mid-Atlantic.

...Synopsis...
On Tuesday, a low amplitude upper trough will move from the Rockies
into the Plains, providing cooling aloft. To the north, an upper
wave will lift out of the Great Lakes, while modest southwest flow
aloft develops over the Appalachians north of an upper high.

At the surface, a low will develop over the TX Panhandle, and a
front associated with the northern wave will stall from Lake MI into
the central Plains. South of this boundary, a very moist air mass
with 70s F dewpoints will exist over a large area. As the upper
trough moves into the Plains, a low-level jet will increase during
the evening with over 50 kt into KS.

...Central Plains...
Areas of morning thunderstorms are expected from parts of southern
NE into eastern KS, though the exact location is uncertain.
Nonetheless, any early activity should generally dissipate during
the day, with very strong instability developing along and south of
I-70 in KS/MO. Southwest winds across the southern High Plains will
extend a low-level lapse rate plume into southwest/central KS, while
mid 70s F dewpoints develop over eastern OK and KS. Meanwhile, the
air mass over NE/CO/WY will likely destabilize/recover during the
afternoon with pockets of strong instability.

Storm evolution is a bit complex for Tuesday and for some areas will
depend on early day storms and outflows. But in general, robust
storms will develop late in the afternoon over much of central into
eastern KS, near the instability axis and downstream of the
low-level lapse rate plume, and, over much of eastern WY/CO and into
western NE where hail and damaging gusts will be possible.

Of particular concern are potential supercells and eventual damaging
MCS development over the Enhanced Risk area late in the day and into
the evening. A conditional risk for tornadoes will exist with
initial activity, should sufficient SRH remain along any residual
outflows from early day storms. Isolated very large hail will also
be probable with slow-moving, large cells. With time,
clustering/aggregating outflows should yield a severe MCS, which may
occur in earnest as activity from the High Plains pushes east late.

...WV into VA and western MD...
Strong heating will occur over much of the southeastern states
beneath the upper ridge, with southwest winds aiding theta-e
advection northward into WV/VA/MD. Midlevel moisture will also exist
across the region, with scattered storms developing during the
afternoon over the higher terrain. Some clustering may occur, with a
small area of locally damaging wind potential late in the day as
storms continue east toward northern VA and western MD.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1159 AM CDT Mon Jun 16 2025

Valid 161700Z - 171200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF SOUTHERN
NEVADA...SOUTHWESTERN UTAH AND NORTHWESTERN ARIZONA...

...Great Basin and Southwest...
Current surface observations show single digit relative humidity
across the southern Great Basin and parts of the Southwest.
Increasing mid-level flow ahead of an upper-level trough coupled
with a very dry/well-mixed boundary layer will promote sustained
surface winds of 20-25 mph across a corridor from southern Nevada,
northwestern Arizona and much of southern Utah with critical
highlights maintained amid the very low relative humidity regime and
dry fuels. Elevated fire weather concerns continue for a broader
area of the Great Basin and Southwest as the upper-level trough
translates eastward through the region. Otherwise, forecast remains
largely on track.

..Williams.. 06/16/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0158 AM CDT Mon Jun 16 2025/

...Synopsis...
A midlevel trough will advance eastward from the West Coast across
parts of the Great Basin/Intermountain West today. Within the base
of the trough, moderate deep-layer westerly flow will overspread the
Great Basin, while a weak surface low/trough evolves over the Lower
CO River Valley.

...Southern NV into Southwest UT and far Northwest AZ...
Along the southern periphery of mid/high-level clouds preceding the
midlevel trough, strong diurnal heating of a warm/dry antecedent air
mass will result in a deeply mixed boundary layer across the
southern Great Basin. The deep mixing into the enhanced flow aloft,
along with a tightening pressure gradient peripheral to the surface
low/trough, will yield single-digit RH and 20-25 mph sustained
southwesterly surface winds (with higher gusts) across southern NV,
southwest UT, and far northwest AZ. Given increasingly dry fuels
across the region, critical fire-weather conditions are expected.

Farther north, modest westerly flow aloft across the Cascades will
contribute to locally dry/breezy downslope flow into the Columbia
Basin, where elevated fire-weather conditions are forecast.

Valid 161630Z - 171200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON
AND EVENING OVER PARTS OF NEBRASKA...AND PARTS OF MINNESOTA....

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms capable of producing severe/damaging
gusts, large to very large hail, and a few tornadoes are forecast
today across parts of the northern/central Plains into the Upper
Mississippi Valley.

...MN/IA...
Morning water vapor imagery shows a shortwave trough over the
eastern Dakotas.  As this trough moves eastward this afternoon, a
surface low will deepen over central MN with a trailing cold front
sweeping across the state.  Morning convection is getting out of the
way, which should allow several hours of strong
heating/destabilization.  Afternoon MLCAPE values of 3000+ J/kg are
expected, with little inhibition.  This should lead to rapid
thunderstorm development by mid-afternoon near the surface low, with
at least widely scattered development southward along the cold front
into northern IA.  Low-level winds are somewhat veered but strong. 
This coupled with favorable westerly flow aloft should promote a few
supercells capable of large hail and damaging winds.  A tornado or
two is also possible.

...NE/KS...
The aforementioned cold front will sag southward into northern NE by
early evening.  A strong southerly low-level jet south of the front,
along with steep mid-level lapse rates and large CAPE, will promote
the development of scattered intense storms along the front. 
Supercells capable of very large hail and damaging winds are
expected, along with perhaps a tornado.  Congealing outflows from
high-based convection are expected to move into the region during
the mid-evening from the west, resulting in upscale convective
growth and an increasing risk of damaging winds.

...MS/AL...
Strong heating is occurring today across much of MS and western AL,
where dewpoints are in the mid 70s.  Clusters of thunderstorms are
forming over LA, which are expected to propagate northeastward
across the region through the day.  Steep low-level lapse rates,
large CAPE, and relatively strong ambient low-level wind fields will
pose some of risk of gusty/damaging wind gusts in the strongest
cells today.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0355 AM CDT Mon Jun 16 2025

Valid 191200Z - 241200Z

...DISCUSSION...
...Thursday/Day 4 and Friday/Day 5...
A mid-level trough is forecast to move into the Northeast on
Thursday, as a cold front advances eastward into the central
Appalachians. Ahead of the front, a moist airmass will be in place.
Moderate instability is expected to develop ahead of the front
across the Carolinas and Mid-Atlantic. As surface temperatures warm
during the day, scattered convective initiation will likely take
place along and ahead of the front. Moderate deep-layer shear and
steep low-level lapse rates should support a severe threat during
the afternoon, with the primary threat being damaging wind gusts.

On Friday, a mid-level ridge is forecast to move eastward across the
northern Plains. Beneath the ridge, a moist airmass will likely be
in place, and moderate instability is expected to develop within
this airmass. Ahead of the ridge, thunderstorm development will be
possible in the upper Mississippi Valley during the afternoon.
Although a severe threat may develop in areas that become moderately
unstable, there is some uncertainty concerning convective coverage
due to the presence of the ridge.

...Saturday/Day 6 to Monday/Day 8...
Mid-level heights are forecast to rise on Saturday and Sunday across
the eastern half of the nation, as a large area of high pressure
dominates. In the western U.S. over the weekend, a mid-level trough
is forecast to move northeastward from the Intermountain West into
the northern High Plains. Ahead of the trough, strong to severe
thunderstorms will be possible Saturday afternoon and evening across
parts of eastern Montana. In spite of the potential, there is still
spatial uncertainty concerning the timing of the trough. The severe
threat is expected to shift northeastward into Canada on Sunday.

On Monday, southwest mid-level flow is forecast over much of the
north-central U.S. Isolated to scattered thunderstorms will be
possible over parts of the northern Plains and upper Mississippi
Valley. An isolated severe threat will again be possible, but there
is considerable uncertainty on any potential scenario.

Mesoscale Discussion 1304
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0349 PM CDT Sun Jun 15 2025

Areas affected...eastern Wyoming into eastern Colorado

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 152049Z - 152245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms expected to increase in coverage with
potential for large hail and damaging wind.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorm activity continues to increase, mainly
along and near the higher terrain/upslope regions, across the Front
Range into portions of eastern Wyoming. The downstream air mass
remains under the influence of strong MLCIN, albeit gradually
weakening along the western fringe. This weakening trend is set to
continue as forcing for ascent increases with a shortwave passage
this afternoon/evening. 

Thunderstorms are likely to form and quickly cluster this evening.
Once uncapped, the downstream air mass is moderately to very
unstable (with MLCAPE around 2000-3500 J/kg). Initially, supercells
capable of large hail and damaging wind will be the main threat
before a transition to linear bowing segments and focus for
potential damaging wind into portions of Nebraska. In the short
term, In addition, deepening cumulus is observed further east across
Cherry County in Nebraska. A supercell or two could emerge within
this region ahead of the main forcing. A watch will likely be needed
to cover these potential threats in the coming hours.

Mesoscale Discussion 1303
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0344 PM CDT Sun Jun 15 2025

Areas affected...Southeast Colorado into eastern New Mexico and far
West Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 152044Z - 152245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Large hail and severe wind gusts are possible with storms
that move off the terrain into southeast Colorado and eastern New
Mexico. A watch is not expected in the short term, but trends will
be monitored into the evening where a more organized wind threat
could evolve farther east.

DISCUSSION...Convection has developed from the Sangre de Cristo into
the southern Rockies this afternoon as moderately moist (mid 50s F
dewpoints) upslope flow has persisted over the last few hours. To
the east, a modifying outflow boundary from an earlier MCS in the
southern Plains has entered eastern New Mexico and should eventually
reach the terrain. While this outflow is slightly cooler, low 60s F
dewpoints have promoted 2000-2500 J/kg MLCAPE with weaker
inhibition. The expectation is for storms to eventually move off the
terrain as MLCIN is eroded in the next hour or two. Modestly
enhanced northwesterlies aloft on the western flank of the MCV atop
southeasterly surface winds supports 35-45 kts of effective shear
(stronger in the north and weaker south). Steep mid-level lapse
rates and strong shear should allow initial supercells to produce
large hail (up to 2.5 inches) as well as severe winds.

Some model guidance has suggested clustering is possible in
northeast New Mexico where stronger shear and greater buoyancy will
overlap. With only a weak low-level jet response in the Texas
Panhandle/South Plains this evening, it is not clear how far east
such a cluster/small MCS could propagate. A greater wind threat
would exist if this occurs. Overall, storm coverage should remain
isolated at least into early evening and a watch is not currently
expected. Trends in convective evolution will need to be monitored
into this evening, however.

Mesoscale Discussion 1302
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0213 PM CDT Sun Jun 15 2025

Areas affected...eastern Montana

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 151913Z - 152115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm development likely to increase over the next
couple of hours with initial supercells capable large to very large
hail and damaging wind.

DISCUSSION...Convective development has begun across the high
terrain in central Montana. This should increased in coverage as a
shortwave rotates out of Idaho into Montana this afternoon/evening
and forcing for ascent increases.

Initially, the moderately unstable and strongly sheared air mass
should support supercells. Given the steep lapse rates and linear
elongated hodographs, these will be capable of large to very large
hail (2-3+ in). Where east to southeasterly flow resides in
east-central/eastern Montana leading to sufficient low level SRH, a
tornado would be possible. 

Evolution through the afternoon should favor clustering and attempts
at upscale growth, to which the primary hazard will likely become
strong to significant damaging wind (some 60-75+ mph). A Severe
Thunderstorm Watch will be needed to cover this threat within the
next couple of hours.

Tropical Storm Dalila Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042025
200 PM MST Sun Jun 15 2025
 
Dalila's convection has collapsed, leaving behind a single
fragmented band of thunderstorms.  Subjective and objective
satellite estimates have lowered this cycle and the initial
intensity has been reduced to 40 kt based on a blend of the TAFB and
SAB Dvorak estimates. Dalila is expected to continue weakening as
the storm moves over cooler waters and into a hostile environment.
The NHC intensity forecast predicts Dalila to become a post-tropical
remnant low later today.
 
The storm is moving west-northwestward at 8 kt and should continue
gradually turning westward in the low-level flow. A more westward
motion is expected in the next day or two until the system
dissipates in a couple of days.

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM MST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Dalila was
located near latitude 18.2 North, longitude 108.4 West. Dalila is
moving toward the west-northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h). A gradual
turn towards the west will occur later today, with a continued
westward motion the next couple of days.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 45 mph (75 km/h) with
higher gusts. Steady weakening is forecast the during the next
couple of days, and the system is expected to become a remnant low

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 418
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
215 PM MDT Sun Jun 15 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Central and eastern Montana
  North central Wyoming

* Effective this Sunday afternoon and evening from 215 PM until
  1100 PM MDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 80
    mph likely
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 3
    inches in diameter likely
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms are expected to increase in coverage and
intensity through the afternoon while spreading eastward from the
higher terrain.  The storm environment initially favors supercells
with very large hail (2-3 inch diameter), while upscale growth into
clusters is expected this evening with an increasing threat for
60-80 mph outflow winds.  Favorable storm interactions could also
support an isolated tornado or two this evening.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 100
statute miles north and south of a line from 30 miles west of
Harlowton MT to 10 miles east northeast of Baker MT. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU8).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
3 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 70 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 550. Mean storm motion vector
27020.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0752 AM CDT Sun Jun 15 2025

Valid 151300Z - 161200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE NORTHERN PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms capable of producing large to very
large hail and swaths of severe/damaging gusts (some 75+ mph) are
likely across portions of central/eastern Montana into northeast
Wyoming and the western Dakotas this afternoon through tonight.
Additional strong to severe thunderstorms may occur across the
central/southern Plains, and over parts of Virginia and North
Carolina.

...Northern/Central Plains...
Ongoing thunderstorms across northeast MT may pose an isolated hail
threat this morning. Otherwise, upper ridging will continue to
prevail over the Southwest and southern Rockies today, with a subtle
mid-level shortwave trough forecast to advance northeastward across
the northern Rockies and adjacent High Plains through the period.
This feature will likely aid in the development of initially
high-based convection over parts of the northern Rockies in MT by
early to mid afternoon. Meanwhile, diurnal heating of a fairly moist
low-level airmass (surface dewpoints generally in the mid to upper
50s) and steep mid-level lapse rates will foster around 2000-3000
J/kg of MLCAPE through the afternoon across much of central/eastern
MT along and south of a convectively reinforced boundary. Modest
low-level east-southeasterly flow will veer to west-southwesterly
and strengthen with height through mid/upper levels. This will
support around 40-50 kt of effective bulk shear and organized
convection.

Intense thunderstorm development appears increasingly likely across
central MT by mid to late afternoon, as large-scale ascent
associated with the shortwave trough overspreads the surface warm
sector. Given the rather favorable thermodynamic/kinematic
environment expected, initial convection will likely be
supercellular and pose a threat for large to very large hail
potentially up to 2-3 inches in diameter. The Enhanced Risk has been
expanded westward some in central MT to account for this expected
supercell development, and a 30% area has been included for large
hail as well. With time this evening, one or more clusters will
likely evolve from the initially discrete activity across eastern MT
into parts of northeast WY and the western Dakotas. Steepened
low-level lapse rates should aid in efficient mixing of intense
downdraft winds to the surface, and swaths of severe/damaging winds
should occur as thunderstorms spread eastward through the evening
and into early Monday morning. Some of these winds may be
significant, with peak gusts potentially reaching up to 70-80 mph on
an isolated basis.

Isolated to scattered high-based thunderstorms should develop along
the surface trough/dryline within a moist low-level upslope flow
regime across portions of southeast WY into eastern CO, and perhaps
persisting into western NE/KS. This activity will pose a risk of
strong to severe outflow winds given a deeply mixed boundary layer
and the presence of very steep low-level lapse rates. Isolated hail
may also occur where any robust updrafts can be maintained within a
modestly sheared environment.

...Southern Plains...
Extensive, loosely organized convection is ongoing this morning
across much of western/southern OK and vicinity. This activity is
being aided by modest low-level warm moist advection associated with
a 20-30 kt southwesterly low-level jet. Current expectations are for
these thunderstorms to generally weaken through the rest of the
morning as the low-level jet gradually weakens. Even so, an isolated
threat for strong/gusty winds may persist with these clusters as
they spread generally south-southeastward. There may be some chance
for either this morning convection or related outflow to regenerate
new, robust convection this afternoon across parts of TX. Have
expanded the Marginal Risk for wind southward a bit to account for
this potential, but in general weak shear should limit convective
organization with southward extent. Otherwise, an isolated severe
threat may exist with convection that develops across AR this
afternoon in proximity to a remnant MCV, and along/east of the
surface lee trough/dryline across the southern High Plains.

...Virginia/North Carolina...
A low-amplitude mid-level shortwave trough will move eastward across
the central/southern Appalachians today. A related weak surface low
should develop eastward near the NC/VA border through the afternoon.
A moist and unstable airmass will likely be in place across much of
NC and southern VA as filtered daytime heating occurs. Poor lapse
rates aloft and modest deep-layer shear should limit the overall
severe potential across this region. Still, isolated wet microbursts
and/or marginally severe hail may occur with the stronger
updrafts/cores that can develop this afternoon and early evening.

Tropical Storm Dalila Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042025
200 AM MST Sun Jun 15 2025
 
Dalila is likely near its peak intensity, with little change in
organization evident since the previous advisory package. The latest
subjective Dvorak intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB were 65
knots and 55 knots, respectively. Objective estimates ranged from
45 to 57 knots, while an ASCAT pass earlier in the day showed
numerous 50 knot wind barbs. Based on a blend of these data, the
initial intensity for this advisory has been held at 55 knots.
 
Dalila is now heading toward the west-northwest, or 285/12 knots. A
turn toward the west is expected during the next day or so, as 
Dalila is steered by a mid-level ridge over northern Mexico and the 
southwest U.S. A westward to slightly south of due west motion is 
then forecast through dissipation as Dalila moves over much
cooler waters. The current forecast shows Dalila becoming a
post-tropical remnant low in a day or so, and dissipating by 
Tuesday. The latest track forecast is very close to that of the 
previous advisory, and is close to the track consensus aids.

Dalila should begin to weaken later today as some drier mid-level
air evident in water vapor imagery begins to impact the system.  
More steady weakening is then likely as the system moves
over much cooler water and into a progressively drier mid-level
environment. The latest intensity forecast is close to the previous
advisory and in good agreement with the intensity consensus
guidance.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. The outer bands of Tropical Storm Dalila will bring locally heavy 
rainfall to the Mexican states of Michoacán and Guerrero through 
this morning. Scattered areas of flooding and mudslides are 
expected, especially in areas of steep terrain near the coast.
 
2. Dalila is expected to produce tropical-storm-force winds across
portions of the warning area during the next few hours.  Winds 
will diminish today while the system moves farther offshore of the 
coast of southwestern Mexico.
