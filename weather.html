Valid 191300Z - 201200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS MORNING
OVER THE CENTRAL FLORIDA PENINSULA....

...SUMMARY...
Strong thunderstorms may impact parts of central Florida this
morning into this afternoon, and pose at least some risk for a
tornado and locally damaging wind gusts.

...FL...
Fast southwesterly flow aloft is present today across FL, beneath
the subtropical jet.  A surface cold front will slowly sag southward
across the central peninsula, with an associated line of
thunderstorms affecting the region.  The surface air mass has slowly
destabilized overnight with dewpoints near 70F along and south of
the front and MUCAPE values approaching 1000 J/kg.  Model guidance
suggests rather strong low-level winds and favorable vertical shear
this morning, providing support for a few rotating/bowing structures
- capable of locally damaging winds or even a brief tornado.  This
threat will likely diminish by late morning as wind fields slowly
weaken and veer.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1112 AM CST Sat Jan 18 2025

Valid 191200Z - 201200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS IN CENTRAL FL...

...SUMMARY...
A tornado and isolated damaging winds will be possible across
central Florida through Sunday afternoon.

...Central FL...
Within a longwave upper trough over much of the CONUS, an intense
mid-level jet streak will move across parts of the Southeast and off
the Mid-Atlantic coast by 12Z Monday. Primary surface cyclone will
deepen as it advances off the Carolina Coastal Plain by Sunday
afternoon. An attendant cold front will trail southwestward and move
south across the FL Peninsula through the period. 

Relatively rich low-level moisture ahead of the front will yield a
plume of upper 60s surface dew points, coinciding with temperatures
warming into the 70s during the day. Buoyancy will remain weak,
MLCAPE below 1000 J/kg, as mid-level lapse rates remain subdued and
poorer with southern extent across the peninsula. Nearly
unidirectional southwesterly wind profiles with pronounced speed
shear will yield moderate low-level hodograph curvature and
elongated/straight mid/upper hodographs. This should result in
potential for a couple supercells during the morning into the
afternoon, despite the wind profile largely paralleling the surface
front. With large-scale ascent weakening through the day, convective
coverage should peak at isolated to scattered around midday before
waning into late afternoon. Overall setup appears supportive of a
low-probability threat for a tornado and locally strong gusts.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1058 AM CST Sat Jan 18 2025

Valid 181700Z - 191200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast (see below) remains on track. Additionally,
dry/breezy post-frontal conditions may favor locally elevated
fire-weather conditions along the Rio Grande in TX this afternoon.
However, near/above-average fuel moisture should keep the threat
localized.

..Weinman.. 01/18/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1233 AM CST Sat Jan 18 2025/

...Synopsis...
A cold airmass, associated with a large-scale mid-level trough, will
dominate much of the CONUS on Saturday. On the western periphery of
the trough, where the geopotential height gradient is  strongest
between an embedded shortwave trough and broad ridging off the U.S.
West Coast, a strong jet streak is forecast to progress
south-southeastward across the Intermountain West. This will result
in dry and windy conditions across the Four Corners region, with
sustained winds reaching 20-25 MPH. Despite the strong surface winds
and low relative humidity, generally cooler temperatures and fuels
that aren't overly receptive to wildfire spread will keep any fire
threat localized.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
FLORIDA PANHANDLE AND ADJACENT PARTS OF SOUTHEAST ALABAMA AND
SOUTHWEST GEORGIA...

...SUMMARY...
Strong thunderstorms may impact parts of the eastern Gulf Coast
vicinity today through tonight, and pose some risk for locally
damaging wind gusts and perhaps a tornado or two.

...FL Panhandle into Southern GA...
Current regional radar imagery shows showers ongoing from far
southwest GA into the western FL Panhandle, along an axis of weak
pre-frontal confluence within the warm sector. Lightning has not
been observed within these showers thus far, but deepening
convective cores suggests some sporadic strikes are possible soon.
Much of this activity is along and north of a warm front that
extends roughly from MGM (in central AL) southeastward to TLH before
arcing back eastward then northeastward across northern FL. Given
that the ongoing activity is progressing eastward/east-northeastward
ahead of this warm front, downstream buoyancy will remain minimal,
with no severe threat anticipated. 

The airmass across the region is expected to continue modifying in
the wake of these storms, with the low/mid 60s dewpoints that are
currently offshore moving northward into the region during the
afternoon and evening. The cold front will likely remain west of the
region until late tonight/early tomorrow morning, but increasing
ascent attendant an approaching shortwave trough coupled with modest
destabilization and persistent warm-air advection should support
another round of showers and embedded thunderstorms this
afternoon/evening. Despite the increasing low-level moisture,
overall buoyancy will remain modest, mitigated by a thermally
neutral boundary layer and relatively warm mid-levels. Even so, the
strong vertical shear that is already in place (i.e. 0-6 km bulk
shear over 70 kt) is expected to persist, supporting the potential
for some organization within any deeper, more sustained updrafts. As
a result, an isolated strong storm or two is possible later today
(mainly this afternoon and evening) with a risk of gusty/damaging
winds or a tornado.

The development of a more coherent line is likely as the front moves
through. Buoyancy will remain a mitigating factor, with the highest
values remaining close to the coast where the higher warmer
temperatures and dewpoints will be in place. The vertical shear will
remain very strong, compensating somewhat for the lower buoyancy and
potentially supporting a continued risk for damaging gusts and maybe
even a tornado or two through the FL Big Bend region early tomorrow
morning.

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms are not expected through tonight.

...20z Update...
The previous forecast remains on track with no changes required.
Thunderstorm potential remains very limited across the CONUS with
only a low chance of a lightning flash or two off the far southern
TX coast early Wednesday. See the previous discussion for additional
details.

..Moore.. 01/14/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1010 AM CST Tue Jan 14 2025/

...Synopsis and Discussion...
Expansive surface high pressure will continue to dominate much of
the CONUS through the period, with minimal thunderstorm potential.
Weak low-level warm/moist advection is forecast to occur tonight
across parts of deep south TX. While modest MUCAPE should eventually
develop over this region, limited large-scale ascent suggests
thunderstorm chances should remain low.

...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms are not expected on Thursday.

...Discussion...
An upper trough will shift steadily across the eastern half of the
U.S. Thursday, while the next feature -- an energetic short-wave
trough digging southeastward out of western Canada -- reaches the
northern Intermountain Region/northern Plains late.

As this feature advances, a deepening surface cyclone is forecast to
shift eastward across the Canadian Prairie Provinces, while a
trailing Arctic cold front progresses southward across the northern
Rockies/northern Plains Thursday night.  

Meanwhile, with cold/dry low-level air already in place across the
U.S., thunderstorms are not anticipated.
