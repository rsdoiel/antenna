Fri Oct 11 2024<br><br>For the North Atlantic…Caribbean Sea and the Gulf
of Mexico:<br><br>Special outlook issued to update discussion of the
disturbance near <br>the Cabo Verde Islands (AL94).<br><br>Active
Systems:<br>The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on
Tropical <br>Storm Leslie, located over the central subtropical Atlantic
Ocean.<br><br>1. Near the Cabo Verde Islands (AL94):<br>Updated: Very
recent satellite-derived wind data indicate that <br>winds to tropical
storm force are occurring over portions of the <br>Cabo Verde Islands in
association with an area of low pressure <br>centered near the
southwestern portion of the archipelago. <br>However, the satellite data
showed that the circulation is <br>elongated, and the associated shower
and thunderstorm activity <br>remains disorganized. Some additional
development is possible, and <br>a short-lived tropical storm could form
while the system moves <br>westward or west-northwestward at 10 to 15
mph across the Cabo Verde <br>Islands and eastern tropical Atlantic
today. On Saturday, <br>environmental conditions are forecast to become
less conducive, and <br>further development appears unlikely after that
time. Regardless of <br>development, winds to tropical storm force and
areas of heavy rain <br>are likely to continue over portions of the Cabo
Verde Islands <br>through tonight. For additional information on this

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0744 AM CDT Fri Oct 11 2024

Valid 111300Z - 121200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorm potential will remain low today.

...Synopsis and Discussion...
Isolated showers and thunderstorms producing occasional lighting may
persist for a few more hours across eastern/southern OK and vicinity
before diminishing as modest warm advection with a
south-southwesterly low-level jet weakens later this morning.

A cold front will advance southeastward across the Upper Midwest and
Great Lakes through the period. While low-level moisture and related
instability are expected to remain quite limited ahead of the front,
cool mid-level temperatures and strong ascent with the upper trough
may support isolated thunderstorms across parts of northern MI this
afternoon and evening. Some of this activity could produce
occasional gusty winds given strengthening low/mid-level flow
through the day, but the overall severe threat still appears low.
The front and upper trough will continue across the Northeast
tonight. But, instability is forecast to remain minimal, which
should hinder thunderstorm potential.

Convection should also develop this afternoon across parts of south
FL and the Keys. Even with poor mid-level lapse rates and warm
temperatures aloft, some of this activity could produce isolated
lightning flashes.

A shortwave trough will move across the northern CA/western OR
vicinity this evening and overnight. Thunderstorms may occur
offshore, but potential for lightning over land appears limited.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1244 AM CDT Fri Oct 11 2024

Valid 121200Z - 131200Z

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough progressing across the Pacific Northwest will
result in modest mid-level westerly flow across the Great Basin,
while east of the Rockies, the flow is predominantly northwesterly
with a stronger jet core moving from Canada into the northern Great
Plains. These mid-level features are responsible for two separate
Elevated highlights on Saturday: one across much of western Utah
into far eastern Nevada and northern Arizona, and the other
stretching from far southern North Dakota/Western Montana into far
northwestern Kansas.

...Great Basin...
Daytime heating and boundary-layer mixing will result in relative
humidity values of 10-15% and surface wind speeds of 15-20 MPH.
While the threat for significant wildfire spread is low, these
conditions overlap with modestly receptive fuels, and dry/windy
conditions the preceding day that will contribute to additional
curing of fuels. 

...Northern and Central Great Plains...
Post-frontal dry/breezy conditions are expected across the northern
and central Great Plains, with the strongest winds (15-20 MPH)
expected further north into South Dakota closer to the mid-level jet
core. While the magnitude of surface winds further south remains
somewhat uncertain, much of the central and northern Great Plains
fuels have ERC values exceeding the annual 98th percentile. Given
the receptiveness of fuels to wildfire spread, Elevated highlights
were extended southward into Nebraska and northern Kansas where
winds could reach 15 MPH.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0800 PM CDT Thu Oct 10 2024

Valid 110100Z - 111200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected tonight.

...Discussion...
Showers and a few thunderstorms will persist this evening -- and
possibly overnight -- across parts of Oklahoma and adjacent North
Texas, as a weak mid-level disturbance drifts southeastward across
this region.  Elsewhere, earlier convection with occasional lighting
flashes over eastern Arizona/western New Mexico will continue to
dissipate, with little to no additional lightning expected.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0358 PM CDT Thu Oct 10 2024

Valid 121200Z - 181200Z

Mid-level ridging over the western and central US is forecast to
slowly breakdown heading into the weekend as a series of West Coast
troughs and increasingly strong flow aloft develop. Strong high
pressure will shift eastward and weaken as troughing develops over
the eastern third of the US. A cold front should move through the
Rockies and northern Plains early this weekend ahead of a second,
stronger, front moving out of southern Canada and across the central
US early next week. Dry and breezy conditions, supporting a low-end
risk for fire-weather conditions, are possible across the Plains,
Midwest and Great Basin through this weekend and into next week.
More widespread fire-weather concerns could develop midweek next
week. 

...Plains and Midwest...
As the ridge aloft weakens, stronger mid-level flow will gradually
move southward, first across the norther Plains and Upper Midwest,
before developing over much of the central US. Dry and breezy
conditions are possible behind and ahead of the aforementioned cold
front through D3/D4 Sat/Sun, though the exact coverage and duration
remains unclear. Still, the lack of recent rainfall and stronger
winds suggests some fire-weather risk could evolve. Gusty southerly
winds and very warm temperature are also possible over parts of the
southern High Plains supporting some risk for locally elevated
fire-weather potential given receptive fuels.

Fire-weather concerns appear likely to increase early to midweek
next week behind the second cold front as a strong area of high
pressure develops over the eastern US. Breezy northerly winds are
possible through early next week ahead of a strong area of low
pressure expected to develop over the southern Plains. Elevated to
critical fire-weather conditions are possible across the Plains and
central US, given the overlap with very dry fuels and little recent
rainfall. However, model guidance varies substantially on the timing
and intensity of conditions.

...Great Basin...
Breezy winds and low RH are possible over portions of the eastern
Great Basin this weekend. Stronger flow aloft associated with
western US troughing and the cold frontal passage could support
another period of dry and windy conditions through early next week.
Forecast certainty of widespread dry and breezy conditions is low,
but Elevated highlights could be needed in future outlooks should
confidence increase.
