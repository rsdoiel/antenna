Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0746 AM CDT Sun Apr 20 2025

Valid 201300Z - 211200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
ARKANSAS AND MISSOURI...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are expected today across parts of the ArkLaTex
into the Ozarks and mid Mississippi Valley, mainly this afternoon
and evening. The best corridor for tornadoes (some of which could be
strong) and scattered to numerous damaging winds should exist from
central/northern Arkansas into Missouri.

...ArkLaTex into the Ozarks and Mid Mississippi Valley...
Extensive convection has occurred overnight and early this morning
across the southern Plains into the Ozarks and mid MS Valley.
Ongoing thunderstorms across south-central TX are expected to
continue weakening over the next couple of hours as they encounter a
strongly capped airmass. Activity over eastern OK into western AR
and MO may pose an isolated hail/wind threat this morning, although
instability will tend to remain weak for at least a few more hours.
Otherwise, a strong mid-level shortwave trough will continue to
eject northeastward from the southern Plains across the Ozarks and
mid MS Valley through the period. An attendant 60-90 kt mid-level
jet will likewise spread northeastward across eastern OK/KS and the
Ozarks through the day. A weak surface low over OK this morning will
also develop northeastward to northern MO by this evening, while a
cold front continues moving eastward over the southern Plains
towards the ArkLaTex.

Ongoing cloudiness and precipitation lend some uncertainty regarding
the degree of destabilization that will occur by this afternoon
across the developing warm sector. Still, most guidance shows that
at least low 60s surface dewpoints and related low-level moisture
will attempt to stream northward across eastern OK and AR/MO in
tandem with a strong southerly low-level jet today. Although daytime
heating will likely be hampered to some extent, even 500-1000 J/kg
of MLCAPE will support surface-based thunderstorms by this
afternoon. This destabilization appears likely to occur in a narrow
corridor along and just ahead of the surface low and related cold
front. Rather strong deep-layer shear will easily support organized
updrafts, including the potential for a mix of supercells and broken
line segments.

Current expectations are for robust thunderstorms to develop
along/near the front across eastern OK and vicinity by early
afternoon (17-19Z), as pronounced large-scale ascent associated with
the ejecting shortwave trough impinges on the warm sector. Given a
weakly unstable and strongly sheared environment, this convection
should intensify fairly quickly as it moves east-northeastward into
AR/MO. The linear forcing of the front suggests that a line or
cluster mode should occur, although some high-resolution guidance
does show more of a broken line of supercells given the strength of
the deep-layer shear. Regardless, the threat for scattered to
numerous severe/damaging winds and tornadoes will increase this
afternoon and evening across the Enhanced Risk and vicinity, as a
40-55 kt southerly low-level jet aids in large 0-3 km hodograph
curvature and elongation. Given the forecast strength of the
low-level shear, some of these tornadoes could be strong (EF-2+),
especially if a mixed supercell/cluster mode can be maintained
versus linear. Hail may also occur with any sustained supercells.
The overall severe threat this evening and overnight will be
tempered on the north by limited low-level moisture and instability,
and on the east by gradually increasing MLCIN.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0323 AM CDT Sun Apr 20 2025

Valid 231200Z - 281200Z

...DISCUSSION...
A low-amplitude southwesterly flow regime will prevail for much of
the Day 4-8 period across portions of the central and eastern U.S.,
with a mean upper trough persisting across the western states.
Persistent south/southeasterly low-level flow across the Gulf and
southern Plains will result in northward transport of rich
boundary-layer moisture across the southern and parts of the central
Plains through at least Day 6/Fri. Forecast guidance suggests weak
shortwave impulses may float through modest southwesterly flow Days
4-5/Wed-Thu, perhaps providing some support for isolated to
scattered thunderstorm potential across the warm sector over
TX/OK/KS. Given a moist and unstable airmass, at least some severe
potential will exist. However, where exactly severe potential may
develop Day 4-5/Wed-Thu is uncertain given a lack of stronger
large-scale ascent and absence of any substantial surface
cyclogenesis, coupled with modest deep-layer flow. This precludes 15
percent probabilities at this time, though outlook areas could
become necessary in later outlooks as smaller-scale features become
better resolved.

A period of weak upper ridging may spread across the Plains and the
eastern U.S. on Days 6-7/Fri-Sat ahead of a more substantial upper
trough developing over the western U.S. This may limit severe
potential late in the week before the western upper trough ejects
east toward the end of the forecast period.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0208 AM CDT Sun Apr 20 2025

Valid 211200Z - 221200Z

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will impinge on the Northeast as a second
mid-level trough ejects into the northern Plains tomorrow (Monday).
Accompanying surface lows over the north-central and northeastern
CONUS will encourage moisture return from the central Plains to the
East Coast. However, given surface lee troughing along the central
High Plains, dry downslope flow is expected tomorrow afternoon.
Guidance consensus depicts 15-20 mph sustained southwesterly surface
winds overlapping with 15-20 percent RH for several hours tomorrow
afternoon. Elevated highlights have been added where the
aforementioned meteorological surface conditions may overspread
areas that have received minimal rainfall in the past week, allowing
fine fuels to support some wildfire-spread potential.

Mesoscale Discussion 0484
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0225 PM CDT Sat Apr 19 2025

Areas affected...parts of southern Indiana...northern Kentucky...and
southwestern Ohio

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 191925Z - 192130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...A few stronger storms -- capable producing strong wind
gusts and small hail -- will be possible this afternoon.  WW
issuance is not anticipated at this time.

DISCUSSION...Latest satellite imagery shows that filtered sunshine
-- and associated afternoon heating -- has occurred over the last
couple of hours, but with an increase in cu/cb at this time --
particularly over southern Indiana.  On the western fringe of the
cumuliform cloudiness, radar indicates increasing deep convection
(over far southwestern Indiana) near the cold front, with some
lightning now indicated.

RAP-based objective analysis shows -- aided by the aforementioned
heating -- that mixed-layer CAPE has increased to near/just above
500 J/kg, and with a bit of additional heating destabilization
possible, some increase in convective intensity is expected over the
next couple of hours.

With low-level flow weakly veering, and increasing to 50 kt between
2km and 3km AGL, and in excess of 70 kt at mid levels, shear is
plenty sufficient to aid in convective organization, and associated
potential for strong wind gusts locally.  Though coverage of any
severe-weather reports would likely remain sparse, thus negating any
current consideration for WW issuance, we will continue to monitor
environmental evolution across the area.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0234 PM CDT Sat Apr 19 2025

Valid 192000Z - 201200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
SOUTHWEST AND CENTRAL TEXAS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are expected to continue across Texas
into southern Missouri this afternoon and evening. Large to very
large hail, damaging winds, and a few tornadoes all appear possible.
Isolated to scattered damaging winds may also occur across portions
of the Ohio Valley into the Northeast.

...20z Update..
No changes are needed to the D1 Convective Outlook. 
 
Thunderstorm activity has initiated within the Enhanced near the
dryline and front intersection across southwestern Texas. Initial
supercells across this area will be capable of large hail and
damaging wind. As the low-level jet increases through the
afternoon/evening, the threat for a few tornadoes may increase. See
MCD483 for more information. 

Convection will continue intermittently along the cold front draped
from the Mid-Mississippi Valley, Ohio Valley, to the Northeast.
Strongly sheared profiles and continued heating through the
afternoon will support some intensification of activity at times,
with potential for damaging wind. See previous discussion and MCD484
for more information.

..Thornton/Moiser.. 04/19/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1130 AM CDT Sat Apr 19 2025/

...Southern Plains to the Ozarks...
Morning surface analysis places a cold front from just south of MAF 
(in west Texas) northeastward through ARG (in northeast AR).
Widespread showers and occasional thunderstorms are currently
ongoing north of this front across OK and AR, and associated outflow
is still aiding in more eastward/southeastward progression of this
boundary across northern/central AR. This eastward/southeastward
progression is expected to slow with time as additional surface
cyclogenesis occurs across west TX ahead of a deep shortwave trough
progressing across Southwest. Low-level southerly/southeasterly flow
will persist south of the stalling boundary, leading to a sharpening
of the gradient through this afternoon/evening. By this afternoon,
dewpoints are expected to be in mid 60s along this boundary from
southwest TX into the Mid-South. This low-level moisture combined
with modest heating will result in airmass destabilization. As
large-scale ascent spreads eastward over the southern High Plains,
robust thunderstorms will likely develop by mid afternoon along/near
the front, and a dryline extending southward across west TX into
northern Mexico.

Strong deep-layer shear around 50-70 kt will support updraft
organization with convection that develops along/near the front and
dryline this afternoon. An initial supercell mode is anticipated,
with large hail as the primary risk. Storms will likely remain
elevated from northwest TX into the Ozarks, but surface-based storms
are more likely across southwest TX. Here, some very large hail
around 2-3 inches in diameter is possible. Strong outflow is
possible as well. 

By early evening, convective mode should become messier as a
gradually strengthening low-level jet and the front encourage
thunderstorm interactions/mergers. Still, a continued large hail and
damaging wind threat will likely persist for much of the evening.
The strengthening low-level jet and resultant increase in low-level
shear could also support some threat for a few tornadoes with any
supercells/clusters that can remain surface based this evening.
Additionally, another round of storms appears likely across Permian
Basin/southwest TX late this evening as the shortwave trough ejects
into the southern High Plains. These storms should have a more
linear orientation, with damaging gusts as the primary risk as they
progress eastward toward central TX late tonight/early tomorrow.

...Mid Mississippi/Ohio Valleys to the Northeast...
Current surface analysis places a cold front extending southwestward
from central Ontario through far southern IL and far southeast MO.
Showers and thunderstorms are ongoing in the vicinity of this front,
with much of this activity elevated behind the front across the Mid
MS and OH Valleys where the deep-layer flow is more parallel to the
boundary. A trend towards a more surface-based structure is
anticipated this afternoon as daytime heating promotes modest
airmass destabilization ahead of the front and the flow become more
orthogonal to the boundary, particularly across the Upper OH Valley
and Northeast. 

Mid-level flow is expected to strengthen this afternoon and evening,
and despite modest buoyancy, deep-layer shear will be strong to
support linear structures capable of damaging gusts, especially as
convection that develops along the front becomes more linear with
time. Overall storm coverage is expected to be high enough to merit
15% wind probabilities along the front into southern NY.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 147
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
220 PM CDT Sat Apr 19 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Northwest and Southwest Texas

* Effective this Saturday afternoon and evening from 220 PM until
  1000 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 3
    inches in diameter likely
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph likely
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm coverage is expected to increase in the
vicinity of stationary boundary extended across the region.
Environmental conditions support discrete supercells capable of all
severe hazards, including very large hail up to 3 to 3.5". Several
strong gusts are possible as well. Any supercells that persist
within the warm sector could produce a tornado or two, but the
overall tornado potential is expected to remain low through the
afternoon.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 80
statute miles east and west of a line from 65 miles east of Dryden
TX to 85 miles north northwest of Mineral Wells TX. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU7).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
3 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
24035.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0157 PM CDT Sat Apr 19 2025

Valid 211200Z - 221200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorm potential appears low on Monday.

...Synopsis...
An upper low will be over the upper MS Valley Monday morning, with a
trough extending southeast toward the OH Valley. This system will
move across the Great Lakes and into the Northeast through Tuesday
morning, losing amplitude as it flattens a ridge along the East
Coast. To the west, a low-amplitude upper trough will move from the
northern Rockies into the northern Plains.

A cold front associated with the Great Lakes system will extend from
western NY/PA southward toward the TN Valley during the afternoon,
and becoming stationary over the lower MS Valley. While scattered
thunderstorms will be possible along the length of the boundary,
severe chances appear low. Northern areas from OH into NY will
experience more favorable lift in association with the upper wave to
the west, but only weak instability with in a narrow axis is
forecast. Farther south, shear will be very weak. 

Elsewhere, isolated storms are possible from MT during the day where
lapse rates will be very steep beneath the upper trough. Activity
may develop late night from the eastern Dakotas into southern MN
with the aid of a developing low-level jet as well, and small hail
cannot be ruled out with this activity with very steep midlevel
lapse rates and minimal melting.

Valid 201200Z - 211200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER MUCH OF
MISSOURI...NORTHERN ARKANSAS...AND FAR WESTERN ILLINOIS...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are expected on Sunday from east Texas into the
lower Missouri and middle Mississippi Valleys. The greatest damaging
wind and tornado potential will be over portions of northern
Arkansas into Missouri and far west-central Illinois.

...MO...AR...Portions of surrounding states...
A compact shortwave trough will eject northeastward out of the TX
Panhandle Sunday morning and into IA by evening. An intense leading
speed max will accompany this wave with strong cooling aloft over
OK, northwest AR, MO and IA. A surface low will deepen as it
develops northward out of OK and into IA as well. 

The cold front will move across far eastern KS and OK and into AR
and MO by mid afternoon, with a warm front moving north and
extending from northern MO into central IL/IN/OH by 00Z. Moderate
southerly winds in the low levels will aid moisture advection with
low 60s F dewpoints behind the warm front.

Early day rain and thunderstorms will likely be ongoing over MO and
IL in association with the advancing warm front. Areas of heating
will occur behind this activity, and ahead of the approaching cold
front with up to 1000 J/kg MUCAPE developing.

Storms will form by early afternoon over far eastern KS and OK, with
an elongated and partially broken line of supercells from the IA/MO
border into AR through 00Z. Wind profiles will favor supercells as
the primary storm mode along the length of the cold front, with the
most likely area for tornadoes from northern AR into central MO
where instability may be strongest. Farther north, cooler midlevel
temperatures and stronger low-level shear may still support
supercells and tornado risk despite weaker instability.

The severe threat will peak during the afternoon and early evening
as the upper system pulls north of the area, however, at least
isolated severe storms may persist into the night across IL and
southward along the MS River.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1141 AM CDT Sat Apr 19 2025

Valid 191700Z - 201200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF SOUTHWEST TEXAS...

...17z Update...
The prior outlook remains largely unchanged. Minimal trimming was
made to the critical area where the cold front has advanced farther
south in Southwest TX. Strong heating will still allow for a few
hours of dry/wind conditions over this area through the afternoon.
Otherwise, see the previous discussion.

..Lyons.. 04/19/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0221 AM CDT Sat Apr 19 2025/

...Synopsis...
A pronounced mid-level trough will traverse the southern Rockies
today, encouraging surface cyclone development over the southern
Plains. Dry westerly downslope flow across southeast New Mexico into
the Trans Pecos region of Texas is expected by afternoon, with
sustained surface winds reaching 20-25 mph amid 10-15 percent RH.
Given that very dry fuels are also present over the region, Critical
highlights have been introduced. 

Meanwhile, dry southeasterly flow is likely across western portions
of the Florida Peninsula this afternoon. 10-15 mph sustained wind
speeds may overlap with 25-35 percent RH for several hours,
necessitating Elevated highlights given dry fuels.

Day 1 Convective Outlook

1130 AM CDT Sat Apr 19 2025

Valid 191630Z - 201200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PART OF
SOUTHWEST AND CENTRAL TEXAS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are likely from parts of Texas into
southern Missouri, mainly this afternoon and evening. Large to very
large hail, damaging winds, and a few tornadoes all appear possible.
Isolated to scattered damaging winds may also occur across portions
of the Ohio Valley into the Northeast.

...Southern Plains to the Ozarks...
Morning surface analysis places a cold front from just south of MAF 
(in west Texas) northeastward through ARG (in northeast AR).
Widespread showers and occasional thunderstorms are currently
ongoing north of this front across OK and AR, and associated outflow
is still aiding in more eastward/southeastward progression of this
boundary across northern/central AR. This eastward/southeastward
progression is expected to slow with time as additional surface
cyclogenesis occurs across west TX ahead of a deep shortwave trough
progressing across Southwest. Low-level southerly/southeasterly flow
will persist south of the stalling boundary, leading to a sharpening
of the gradient through this afternoon/evening. By this afternoon,
dewpoints are expected to be in mid 60s along this boundary from
southwest TX into the Mid-South. This low-level moisture combined
with modest heating will result in airmass destabilization. As
large-scale ascent spreads eastward over the southern High Plains,
robust thunderstorms will likely develop by mid afternoon along/near
the front, and a dryline extending southward across west TX into
northern Mexico.

Strong deep-layer shear around 50-70 kt will support updraft
organization with convection that develops along/near the front and
dryline this afternoon. An initial supercell mode is anticipated,
with large hail as the primary risk. Storms will likely remain
elevated from northwest TX into the Ozarks, but surface-based storms
are more likely across southwest TX. Here, some very large hail
around 2-3 inches in diameter is possible. Strong outflow is
possible as well. 

By early evening, convective mode should become messier as a
gradually strengthening low-level jet and the front encourage
thunderstorm interactions/mergers. Still, a continued large hail and
damaging wind threat will likely persist for much of the evening.
The strengthening low-level jet and resultant increase in low-level
shear could also support some threat for a few tornadoes with any
supercells/clusters that can remain surface based this evening.
Additionally, another round of storms appears likely across Permian
Basin/southwest TX late this evening as the shortwave trough ejects
into the southern High Plains. These storms should have a more
linear orientation, with damaging gusts as the primary risk as they
progress eastward toward central TX late tonight/early tomorrow.

...Mid Mississippi/Ohio Valleys to the Northeast...
Current surface analysis places a cold front extending southwestward
from central Ontario through far southern IL and far southeast MO.
Showers and thunderstorms are ongoing in the vicinity of this front,
with much of this activity elevated behind the front across the Mid
MS and OH Valleys where the deep-layer flow is more parallel to the
boundary. A trend towards a more surface-based structure is
anticipated this afternoon as daytime heating promotes modest
airmass destabilization ahead of the front and the flow become more
orthogonal to the boundary, particularly across the Upper OH Valley
and Northeast. 

Mid-level flow is expected to strengthen this afternoon and evening,
and despite modest buoyancy, deep-layer shear will be strong to
support linear structures capable of damaging gusts, especially as
convection that develops along the front becomes more linear with
time. Overall storm coverage is expected to be high enough to merit
15% wind probabilities along the front into southern NY.

Mesoscale Discussion 0471
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0351 PM CDT Fri Apr 18 2025

Areas affected...parts of cntrl and srn Lower Michigan

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 182051Z - 182245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...The potential for thunderstorm initiation along and just
south of a warm frontal zone across lower Michigan is being
monitored for a possible severe weather watch issuance, as this may
be accompanied by increasing risk for severe hail and wind by 6-8 PM
EDT.

DISCUSSION...A weak perturbation, within larger-scale anticyclonic
flow on the northwestern periphery of prominent mid-level ridging,
will continue to progress across and northeast of the middle
Mississippi Valley through late afternoon.  Associated forcing for
ascent appears to have aided a flare up of convection approaching
the Greater Milwaukee vicinity, and latest Rapid Refresh suggests
that this may contribute to erosion of inhibition associated with
elevated mixed-layer air across southern Lower Michigan by the
22-00Z time frame.  

As this occurs, the moistening boundary-layer along and south of a
warm frontal zone (downstream of a weak surface low migrating across
southern Wisconsin/northern Illinois) may become characterized by
CAPE in excess of 1000 J/kg within the next couple hours, in the
presence of strong deep-layer shear.  Although calibrated HREF and
NCEP SREF guidance indicates highest probabilities for thunderstorm
development evolving above/to the north of the warm frontal zone,
initiation of storms closer to and just south of the frontal zone
will provide the highest potential for organizing and intensifying
into a severe hail and wind threat.

Mesoscale Discussion 0470
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0340 PM CDT Fri Apr 18 2025

Areas affected...north-central Texas and south-central and central
Oklahoma

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 182040Z - 182315Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Severe threat to increase through the afternoon and
evening. All hazards possible including large hail, damaging wind,
and tornadoes.

DISCUSSION...Surface analysis indicates a cold front located from
northeastern through the Oklahoma City metro into southwestern
Oklahoma to northwest Texas as of 20z. A dryline was located from
southwestern Oklahoma into southwestern Texas. Ahead of the front, a
broad area of mid to high level cloud cover has been in place across
of southwestern/central Oklahoma, which has limited stronger daytime
heating in this area. Breaks in the clouds have allowed temperatures
to warm into the upper 70s to 80s across eastern Oklahoma. A
gradient of MLCAPE around 500-1500 J/kg extends southwest to
northeast across north-central Texas into eastern Oklahoma with
strong deep layer shear around 55-65 kts.

Recent runs of CAM guidance indicate potential for storm initiation
across north-central Texas into southwestern Oklahoma at the
intersection of the dryline and cold front. Forecast soundings
indicate elongated largely straight hodographs and steep mid-level
lapse rates, indicative of splitting supercells capable of large to
very large (2-3"+) hail. This would support some potential for a
storm or two to move northward to the cool side of the boundary,
where the tornado threat should be minimal. Where the surface based
warm sector resides, downstream  tornado threat may evolve into the
evening as additional development occurs along the cold front and
cells move eastward into more favorable instability and backed
surface winds. A watch or weather watches will be needed in the
coming hours to highlight these potential severe threats.

Mesoscale Discussion 0469
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0253 PM CDT Fri Apr 18 2025

Areas affected...swrn through much of ern MO...cntrl and nrn IL

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 181953Z - 182230Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...The initiation of thunderstorms probably will begin to
increase by 5-7 PM, but this may be slow and rather widely scattered
in nature, resulting in uncertainty concerning severe weather watch
issuance.  Storms that do develop may include supercells with severe
hail, locally strong surface gusts, and at least some risk for a
tornado.

DISCUSSION...Much of the region remains beneath strong, but broadly
anticyclonic mid/upper flow, on the northwestern periphery of
prominent large-scale ridging within a stagnant to slowly
progressive regime.  However, one weak embedded mid-level
perturbation has been slowly shifting into/across the middle
Mississippi Valley vicinity, with associated lift contributing to a
gradual erosion of mid-level inhibition associated with elevated
mixed-layer air across Missouri into Illinois.

This is coinciding with diurnal destabilization of a modestly moist
boundary layer within lee surface troughing across the region. 
Although this has been slowed by broken layers of cloudiness,
mixed-layer CAPE appears on the order of 1000-1500 J/kg, with at
least some further increase through 22-00Z.  At the same time,
low-level hodographs may enlarge beneath southwesterly 850 mb flow
forecast to strengthen to 30-40+ kt.

As the environment becomes conditionally supportive of supercell
development across a sizable area, the focus for and extent of
thunderstorm initiation remains more unclear.  Guidance suggests
that inhibition will become weakest within a relatively narrow
corridor near/just ahead of the cold front now still west of the
Rockford and Quincy IL, Columbia and Joplin MO, vicinities. 
However, better mid/upper forcing for ascent continues to spread
ahead of the front across parts of northern/central Illinois and
east central into south central Missouri.  Currently, it appears
that thunderstorm initiation will be gradual and rather widely
scattered into late afternoon.

Mesoscale Discussion 0467
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0722 AM CDT Fri Apr 18 2025

Areas affected...Southern Wisconsin...Lake Michigan

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 142...

Valid 181222Z - 181415Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 142
continues.

SUMMARY...A severe threat will likely continue over the next couple
of hours from parts of southern Wisconsin eastward over Lake
Michigan. Significant wind gusts and large hail will be possible
with the strongest of cells.

DISCUSSION...The latest high-resolution radar imagery from KMKX
shows a cluster of strong to severe storms over southern Wisconsin,
with a severe short line segment located about 40 statute miles to
the west of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The storms are located along an
east-to-west gradient of instability, where the RAP is estimating
MUCAPE around 1000 J/kg. RAP forecast soundings to the west of
Milwaukee still have a temperature inversion from the surface to 850
mb, with strong effective shear above the inversion. This will
continue to support elevated supercell development. In addition,
forecast soundings have steep lapse rates in the 700 to 500 mb
layer, which will aid a threat for large hail with supercells.
Hailstones greater than 2 inches in diameter will be possible in the
more intense cores. The stronger and faster moving line segments
could also produce severe gusts, with 70+ mph gusts possible. The
severe threat is expected to become more isolated later this
morning. To the east of the current watch, watch issuance probably
won't be needed. Trends will be monitored.

hail may increase by 5-7 PM CDT, if not a bit earlier.  It is
possible that the potential for a tornado or two could increase
near/north and east of the Greater Omaha area later this evening.

DISCUSSION...Trailing the surface low, which is now migrating north
of the Redwood Falls MN vicinity, a surface cold front is
maintaining a southward advancement into/across the Sioux
Falls/Sioux City areas, Norfolk NE and the Grand
Island/Kearney/Hasting NE vicinities.  Substantive boundary-layer
warming and moistening (including surface dew points near 60F)
continues in a narrow corridor ahead of this feature, where
mixed-layer CAPE may continue to increase up to around 2000 J/kg
within the next few hours, beneath a warm and capping elevated
mixed-layer area.

Models continue to suggest that mid-level forcing for ascent
associated with a weak short wave perturbation may increasingly
contribute to subtle mid-level height falls and erosion of the
lower/mid-tropospheric inhibition as far south as the Lincoln and
Omaha NE vicinities by 22-00Z.  As this occurs, potential for the
initiation of thunderstorm activity will increase, both along and
ahead of the cold front.  Although there may be a tendency for
convection to become undercut by the front, convection allowing
model output suggests that forcing associated with pre-frontal warm
advection may maintain at least one or two sustained storms,
propagating to the right of the 30-40 kt west-southwesterly mean
flow.

As long as this occurs, it appears that the environment may become
conducive to supercells capable of produce swaths of large hail, at
least occasionally in excess of 2 inches in diameter.  Low-level
flow and shear are initially weak, but strengthening toward early
evening might result in an increase in potential for a tornado
near/north and east of Greater Omaha.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 140
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
345 PM CDT Thu Apr 17 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Northwest and Northern Iowa
  Southern and Southeast Minnesota
  Far Northeast Nebraska
  West-Central Wisconsin

* Effective this Thursday afternoon and evening from 345 PM until
  1000 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2
    inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...Scattered thunderstorms are forecast to develop and
intensify through the early evening across the Watch area.  The
stronger storms will be capable of a threat for large to very large
hail (1 to 2 inches in diameter) and damaging gusts.  Upscale growth
into a linear cluster is possible this evening across southern
Minnesota as this activity moves east towards the Mississippi River.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 65
statute miles east and west of a line from 25 miles northeast of
Minneapolis MN to 30 miles south southwest of Storm Lake IA. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU0).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 450. Mean storm motion vector
25030.

Mesoscale Discussion 0454
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0349 PM CDT Wed Apr 16 2025

Areas affected...parts of swrn into s cntrl KS

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 162049Z - 162315Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...An isolated supercell or two may evolve from initially
high-based thunderstorm development by 6-7 PM CDT, posing primarily
a risk for severe hail and locally strong surface gusts.

DISCUSSION...As boundary-layer heating and mixing continues,
deepening high-based convective development is ongoing in a corridor
near/north of the Raton Mesa vicinity into southwestern Kansas. 
This appears focused downstream of a weak mid-level perturbation,
which is progressing toward the crest of large-scale mid-level
ridging across the southern Rockies through southern Great Plains. 
With continuing insolation, this convective development is likely to
persist and gradually spread northeastward and eastward with the
supporting large-scale forcing for ascent.  

Strongest boundary-layer heating appears focused northwest of the
Dalhart TX toward Dodge City KS vicinity, where surface dew points
remain in the upper 30s to lower 40s F.  However, more substantive
moistening is ongoing farther east, including a corridor across the
Medicine Lodge toward Great Bend KS vicinities, where dew points may
continue to increase into and through the lower mid 50s F, as
southerly low-level flow strengthens through 23-00Z.  It appears
that this may contribute mixed-layer CAPE increasing to the order of
1000 J/kg.

In the presence of lower/mid-tropospheric warm advection, the
boundary-layer destabilization may largely remain suppressed by
warming, elevated mixed-layer air.  However, the eventual
intensification of initially high-based convection overspreading the
region appears at least possible later this afternoon, particularly
near/east of the Dodge City vicinity, aided by inflow of the
potentially more unstable air.  If this becomes sustained, shear
beneath moderate to strong westerly mid/upper flow appears more than
sufficient to support the evolution an isolated boundary-layer based
supercell or two, primarily posing a risk for severe hail and
locally strong surface gusts.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0110 PM CDT Mon Apr 14 2025

Areas affected...parts of cntrl/sern SD...swrn MN...nern IA...nern
NE

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 141810Z - 142115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Showers spreading southeastward through the mid Missouri
Valley may begin to intensify by 3-4 PM CDT, with a few weak
thunderstorms developing and posing increasing potential for strong
to severe surface gusts while spreading southeastward through the
remainder of the afternoon.

DISCUSSION...In the wake of a deep cyclone, now migrating northeast
of the Upper Great Lakes region, downward mixing of momentum is
already contributing to 30-35+ kt northwesterly surface gusts across
much of the middle Missouri Valley, as boundary-layer warming
progresses.  This is occurring just ahead of a vigorous short wave
trough now digging through the western Dakotas, and forecast to
continue rapidly southeastward through early evening.  

Models indicate that the mid-level cold core (including -30 to -35C
around 500 mb) will overspread a corridor from central South Dakota
through northeastern Iowa between 20-23Z, coincident with further
strengthening of northwesterly flow (35-40+ kt) in the 850-700 mb
layer and peak afternoon surface heating.  As this occurs, forecast
soundings indicate that profiles will become increasingly conducive
to deepening convection capable of producing lightning. 

With at least some further intensification of ongoing developing
convection, evaporative cooling and melting of precipitation within
an increasing well-mixed boundary layer (characterized by sizable
surface temperature/dew point spreads on the order of 20+ F),
coupled with the downward mixing of stronger flow aloft, seems
likely to contribute to increasing potential for surface gusts
approaching or briefly exceeding severe limits.  This may continue
into early evening, as convection spreads southeastward, before
rapidly diminishing with the onset of boundary-layer cooling.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 138
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
325 PM EDT Mon Apr 14 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Central and Eastern Kentucky
  Southern Ohio
  Far Southwestern Pennsylvania
  Southwestern Virginia
  West Virginia

* Effective this Monday afternoon and evening from 325 PM until
  1100 PM EDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph likely
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2
    inches in diameter possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms coverage is expected to increase over the
next few hours along and ahead of a cold front pushing eastward
across the region. Environmental conditions support strong to severe
storms. An initially cellular mode will favor large hail and

statute miles north and south of a line from 30 miles west of
Lexington KY to 60 miles north northeast of White Sulphur Springs
WV. For a complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch
outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU8).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.
