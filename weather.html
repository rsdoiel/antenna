Mesoscale Discussion 0073
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0749 AM CST Tue Jan 16 2024

Areas affected...Parts of the Mid Atlantic into southern New England

Concerning...Winter mixed precipitation 

Valid 161349Z - 161745Z

SUMMARY...Locally moderate winter precipitation rates will spread
northeastward this morning, with some modest ice accretion possible
where freezing rain persists.

DISCUSSION...A surface low currently off of the Mid Atlantic coast
is forecast to gradually deepen as it moves northeast toward coastal
southern New England this morning. Multiple waves of light to
locally moderate precipitation are ongoing and will continue to
spread northeastward in conjunction with the surface low. While
interior portions of the Northeast will likely continue to see snow
(with generally light to moderate rates) this morning, low-level
warm advection will support a transition from snow to sleet across
parts of southern New England, with freezing rain persisting over
portions of the Mid Atlantic region.

As the low deepens offshore, a modest uptick in precipitation
intensity will be possible through the morning. While rates will
likely remain light to locally moderate, antecedent cold conditions
(with temperatures initially in the 20s F) may result in relatively
efficient ice accretion in areas that transition to freezing rain.
Pockets of moderate sleet/snow will also be possible into parts of
southern New England. Low-level warm advection will support a
gradual transition to rain along the Mid Atlantic and southern New
England coasts, but subfreezing temperatures may persist inland
through the morning.

Mesoscale Discussion 0074
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1017 AM CST Tue Jan 16 2024

Areas affected...Central Florida

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 161617Z - 161815Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...A line of storms moving onto the Florida west coast within
the next hour may pose a risk of damaging winds. Watch issuance is
not anticipated.

DISCUSSION...A band of convection focused along a cold front is
slowly approaching the FL west coast per recent radar/satellite
imagery. GOES IR and lightning trends show a few intensifying
updrafts within the line, denoted by concentrated lightning clusters
and cooling cloud top temperatures. This trend should continue as
the line moves onshore where temperatures are warming into the
low/mid 70s and MLCAPE values are slowly increasing to 1000-1500
J/kg. VWP observations from KTBW show 0-6 km BWD values around 50-60
knots, but deep-layer shear vectors are largely oriented along the
boundary with weak line-normal deep-layer shear. This may limit the
overall organization/intensity of the line, but may support stronger
embedded segments capable of damaging winds. This kinematic regime
is not overly favorable for line-embedded tornadoes, but a brief
tornado appears possible if a portion of the line can become more
oriented from southeast to northwest. Confidence in this scenario is
low at this time given recent storm trends, and a damaging wind risk
appears more probable. Regardless, the overall severe threat appears
too limited to warrant watch issuance.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1001 AM CST Tue Jan 16 2024

Valid 161630Z - 171200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON
ACROSS CENTRAL FL...

...SUMMARY...
A brief tornado or two and isolated damaging winds are possible
through this afternoon across central Florida.

...Central FL this afternoon...
A broad midlevel trough from the Ozarks to the OH Valley will
progress eastward to the Atlantic coast by late tonight, as an
associated surface cold front moves southeastward across
central/south FL.  A subtle/embedded speed max over the northern
Gulf of Mexico will move over north FL this afternoon, and this will
help focus thunderstorm development through the day across central
FL, both along and south of the cold front.  Midlevel lapse rates
will not be steep, but some cloud breaks north of ongoing convection
and boundary-layer dewpoints in the low 70s will contribute to
MLCAPE near 1000 J/kg ahead of the cold front, and somewhat larger
buoyancy along the southern fringes of the ongoing convection in
central FL.  

The storms west of Tampa have shown some increase in intensity along
the front, and additional storm development is possible along the
southern periphery of the ongoing storms across central FL. 
Deep-layer vertical shear/hodograph length will be sufficient for
some organized/rotating storms, while low-level hodograph
curvature/SRH will remain relatively larger through early afternoon
and begin to decrease by mid-late afternoon as low-level flow veers.
 The net result will be the potential for line segments or
supercells capable of producing isolated wind damage.  A brief
tornado or two will also be possible, focused a little more toward
the Atlantic coast where low-level shear will be modestly stronger
through more of the afternoon.

0637 AM CST Tue Jan 16 2024

Valid 161300Z - 171200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS IN CENTRAL
FLORIDA...

...SUMMARY...
A couple brief tornadoes and isolated damaging winds are possible
this morning into the afternoon over parts of the Florida Peninsula.

...Synopsis...
Broadly cyclonic flow in mid/upper levels will be maintained over
most of the CONUS, as a large cyclone meanders over the southern
Hudson Bay/northern ON region.  A basal shortwave trough was
apparent in moisture-channel imagery from Lower MI across southern
IL to the KS/OK border vicinity.  By 00Z, this perturbation is
expected to elongate further and pivot to northern NY, PA, WV, parts
of KY/TN, and AR.  By 12Z tomorrow, the trough should be over or
just offshore of the coast from New England to northeastern NC,
arching inland to the TRI area. 

At the surface, 11Z analysis showed two primary fronts:
1.  A warm to quasistationary boundary extended from a low near Cape
San Blas southeastward across central FL to a weak low near XMR,
then northeastward approximately along the western part of the Gulf
Stream past the NC Outer Banks.  This boundary should drift
northward over land through much of the day, potentially reaching
north-central FL before being overtaken by the next front.
2.  An Arctic cold front was drawn from the San Blas low
northeastward to another low between HKY-AVL, and southwestward
across the central Gulf.  This front will move offshore of all the
Atlantic Coast by 00Z, except central FL.  By 12Z, the cold front
should clear the entire FL Peninsula and Keys. 

...FL Peninsula...
Widely scattered to scattered thunderstorms are expected to move
roughly eastward across the area, both from the Gulf on either side
of the southern front, and from development over land along and
south of that boundary.  Isolated damaging to severe gusts are
possible -- mainly near and south of the southern front where
surface-based inflow is expected.  A tornado also may occur in the
same regime -- especially closer to the Atlantic Coast where more
potential exists for storm-scale interaction with sea-breeze and/or
favorably aligned outflow boundaries.  

For this outlook cycle, unconditional severe probability bins
overall are kept at marginal categorical level, but appear
nonuniform within that.  Overall, they would appear somewhat greater
to the east and lower to the west, if continuous/heatmap-style
coloring were available.  Activity over the central and especially
eastern parts of the peninsula -- along and south of the southern
then combined front -- will have access to a richly moist boundary
layer with the longest time frame for diurnal destabilization of the
inflow layer.  Somewhat muted diabatic heating through cloud cover
will slow the pace of destabilization, but still yield favorably
uninhibited buoyancy.  With surface dewpoints in the upper 60s to
low 70s F, that heating should offset weak low/middle-level lapse
rates enough to yield MLCAPE generally in the 1000-1500 J/kg range. 


With little change in either heights or height gradient aloft, mid/
upper-level winds and deep shear should remain favorable through the
day, albeit with some decrease as winds veer near the surface. 
Supercell and bowing/clustered modes are possible within the band(s)
of convection.  However, the veering will lead to gradual shrinking/
straightening of hodographs during the period of daytime
destabilization (offsetting factors).  This will make tornado
potential conditional on more storm- to local-scale effects. 
Activity should weaken with southward extent this evening as the
combined boundary moves into a nocturnally stabilizing airmass, with
still more veering of near-surface flow.

No appreciable changes have been made to the prior forecast.

..Gleason.. 01/15/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1016 AM CST Mon Jan 15 2024/

...Central FL this afternoon...
Cyclonic flow aloft will persist over the CONUS from the Rockies
eastward, with ridging over the Pacific coast.  One embedded speed
maxima will progress east-northeastward from the Mid-South to the
Mid-Atlantic, in advance of an upstream wave moving from the central
High Plains/Rockies to the mid MS/lower OH Valleys.  The majority of
the CONUS will be relatively cold/dry, with the only buoyant warm
sector confined to the FL peninsula (and just off the southeast
Atlantic coast tonight).  The ongoing convection between Fort Meyers
and Sarasota could persist through the afternoon while spreading
east-northeastward along the warm front.  There will be sufficient
vertical shear/hodograph length for a weakly rotating storm within
the cluster, but poor midlevel lapse rates and modest low-level
flow/shear suggest that severe storms are unlikely.

Mesoscale Discussion 0069
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1150 AM CST Mon Jan 15 2024

Areas affected...parts of middle and eastern Tennessee

Concerning...Heavy snow 

Valid 151750Z - 152045Z

SUMMARY...An area of heavier snow rates, occasionally approaching 1
inch per hour, may be maintained east-northeastward across portions
of middle and eastern Tennessee through 2-4 PM CST, before gradually
diminishing through early evening.

DISCUSSION...A mid-level speed maximum propagating across northern
Mississippi is forecast to reach the Cumberland Plateau by early
evening.  This  still appears associated with an area of enhanced
mid/upper forcing for ascent, which might be maintained through the
20-22Z time frame while overspreading portions of middle through
eastern Tennessee.  Thereafter, frontogenetic forcing is forecast to
generally weaken across the Tennessee Valley through southern
Appalachians vicinity, yielding diminishing precipitation rates. 
Until then, it appears that the area of enhanced lift will include
upward vertical motion maximized within the favorably cold mid-level
layer (centered around or above 600 mb) for large dendritic ice
crystal growth.  It appears this may remain strong enough to support
continuing potential for occasional heavy snow rates up to around 1
inch per hour, where lower/mid tropospheric profiles are maintained
at or below freezing (roughly north of the 0 C isotherm at 859 mb).

Mesoscale Discussion 0068
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1117 AM CST Mon Jan 15 2024

Areas affected...Louisiana into Mississippi and northern Alabama

Concerning...Winter mixed precipitation 

Valid 151717Z - 152115Z

SUMMARY...A wintry mix of snow, sleet, and freezing rain is expected
to spread east from southeast Arkansas and northern Louisiana into
Mississippi and northern Alabama through early afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Surface observations, LSRs, and MPING reports over the
past 1-2 hours continue to show a mix of snow, sleet, and freezing
rain from the ArkLaTex region into northern MS/AL within a broad
precipitation swath. Isentropic ascent over a 925-850 mb frontal
zone is forecast to persist through early afternoon as a
low-amplitude wave, currently over the southern Plains, migrates
east. Recent sleet LSRs and forecast soundings suggest that a mix of
snow and sleet will be more likely where surface temperatures are in
the low 20s or lower. Areas where temperatures are in the mid-20s or
higher should have too shallow/warm of a sub-freezing layer to
support much re-freezing of hydrometeors, making a sleet/freezing
rain mix more probable. Forecast guidance suggests that
precipitation intensity may gradually wane heading into the
mid-afternoon hours, but a zone of impactful wintry precipitation
appears probable prior to this occurring.

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms appear unlikely on Tuesday.

...Synopsis and Discussion...
A large upper cyclone will encompass much of the central/eastern
CONUS and Canada on Tuesday. Thunderstorm potential will remain
limited to locations along/south of a front forecast to be in place
over the FL Peninsula, where greater low-level moisture will reside.
As the upper trough progresses eastward through the day, a weak
surface reflection should develop from the northeastern Gulf of
Mexico to the coastal western Atlantic. The cold front should also
move southeastward across the FL Peninsula through the period.

Strong (50-60 kt) mid-level west-southwesterly flow associated with
the upper cyclone will be present over much of FL. Similar values of
deep-layer shear would typically support organized severe
thunderstorm potential. However, in this case forecast thermodynamic
profiles across central/south FL will likely hinder updraft
intensity, as poor mid-level lapse rates and warm temperatures aloft
limit the degree of instability that can develop. In addition,
enhanced low/mid-level flow will be largely parallel to the surface
front, limiting low-level convergence/ascent. While there may be
some potential for strong/gusty winds with any convection that
develops and can remain south of the front, the undercutting nature
of the boundary suggests that overall severe potential will probably
remain too low/sparse for highlights.

Mesoscale Discussion 0063
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1049 AM CST Sun Jan 14 2024

Areas affected...Southeast New York into the New England region

Concerning...Snow Squall 

Valid 141649Z - 142045Z

SUMMARY...Thermodynamic conditions will remain favorable for snow
squalls as a cold front pushes east into the New England region.

DISCUSSION...Recent regional radar depicts broken bands of shallow
convection along an eastward moving cold front from upstate NY into
eastern PA. Visibility reductions between 1/4 to 1 mile have been
observed with the passage of these bands and are primarily being
driven by bursts of moderate to heavy snow with 25-35 mph wind
gusts. The 12 UTC PIT sounding likely sampled the convective
environment most accurately with nearly dry adiabatic lapse rates
from the surface to ~750 mb, which appears to be represented well by
recent 0-3 km lapse rate analyses. The plume of 8+ C/km low-level
lapse rates is forecast to spread to the northeast into the New
England region through the day in tandem with the cooler mid-level
temperatures associated with the primary trough axis. Low-level
instability should be bolstered by modest diurnal heating between
cloud breaks through the afternoon, and a weak influx of moisture
may support occasional lightning flashes, though sustained,
lightning-producing convection is not necessarily anticipated.
Nonetheless, the combination of improving low-level thermodynamics,
focused ascent along the front, and 30-40 mph winds within the
boundary layer should maintain the snow squall potential well into
the afternoon.
