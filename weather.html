Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0330 AM CDT Mon May 05 2025

Valid 081200Z - 131200Z

...DISCUSSION...
From Thursday into the weekend, the upper-level pattern will be
characterized by an elongated trough in the East and a building
ridge in the West. With this weakly blocking pattern, slow
progression of these features can be expected. With the trough in
the East, moisture will be present south of a surface boundary
across parts of the Southeast and eventually into the Florida
Peninsula. Though organized severe potential appears low with this
activity, enough remnant mid-level flow could promote localized
strong storms. By next week, models currently suggest some troughing
is possible in the West. With preceding days of offshore winds
across the western Gulf, moisture quality ahead of any potential
trough is likely to be low.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0200 AM CDT Mon May 05 2025

Valid 061200Z - 071200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Fire weather potential appears limited for Tuesday across the
country. Residual dry/windy conditions are possible across parts of
southwest TX and far southern NM as a westerly downslope flow regime
becomes established with the eastward departure of a deepening
surface low. Elevated fire weather conditions will be possible,
especially on the leeward side of more prominent terrain features
where downslope winds and drying may be enhanced. While most
solutions agree on the general flow regime, disparity in the wind
speed forecast among deterministic models and ensemble guidance
limits confidence in the potential for a sustained fire weather
threat.

Mesoscale Discussion 0684
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0338 PM CDT Sun May 04 2025

Areas affected...southeast NM and far west TX

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 222...

Valid 042038Z - 042215Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 222
continues.

SUMMARY...Supercells are expected to intensify across southeast New
Mexico into parts of far west Texas through early evening. Hail is
the primary hazard, likely reaching golf to tennis ball size.
Isolated severe gusts to 70 mph and a brief tornado are possible.

DISCUSSION...Overall forecast remains as advertised. Storm
intensification has been gradual, but largely focused near the
Sacramento Mountains in Otero and Lincoln counties, and separately
over Eddy and Chaves, spreading into Lea within NM. These cells and
others that should develop off the higher terrain of the northern
Trans-Pecos in TX will likely intensify during the next few hours. A
ribbon of surface dew points near 50 F have held along the Pecos
Valley, supporting a confined corridor of moderate buoyancy. With
onset of strengthening low-level flow around 22Z, supercell
coverage/intensity should peak into early evening. Thereafter, drier
low-level air over the TX South Plains and eastern Permian Basin
should result in increased ingest of MLCIN deeper into the evening.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0256 PM CDT Sun May 04 2025

Valid 042000Z - 051200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
EASTERN NEW MEXICO AND WEST TEXAS....

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are expected across parts of eastern
New Mexico and west Texas this afternoon and evening. Large to very
large hail, isolated severe wind gusts, and possibly a tornado or
two may occur. Additional sporadic severe storms are possible over
the Ohio Valley and Atlantic Coast.

...20z Update...
Mid afternoon water vapor imagery shows two well-defined upper lows
ongoing across the CONUS. Ascent from these features is supporting
several clusters of strong to severe storms. While buoyancy is
somewhat limited, moderate deep-layer shear will continue to support
a risk for damaging gusts and marginally severe hail with more
organized/persistent clusters across parts of the OH Valley,
Carolinas and parts of FL this afternoon and evening. Probabilities
have been trimmed from the west where storms are moving offshore
across FL.

Across the west, supercells with large to very large hail, damaging
gusts and perhaps a tornado or two will remain likely from parts of
southeastern NM into west TX. Upslope flow is supporting an increase
in storm coverage this afternoon. As destabilization continues,
scattered severe storms are likely into this evening. Have adjusted
severe probabilities slightly farther west to better capture
convective initiation off the higher terrain. See Severe
Thunderstorm Watch 222 for additional information.

...Great Basin and western US...
Beneath the western upper low, scattered thunderstorms have
developed and will likely persist into this evening from the Four
Corners into parts of the Great Basin. Cool mid-level temperatures
are supporting weak, but sufficient buoyancy for occasional stronger
storms. Moderate deep-layer shear may also support occasional storm
organization. While meager surface moisture will limit a more robust
threat, a sporadic damaging gust and/or small hail cannot be ruled
out from any stronger storms/clusters that persist, especially over
northwestern AZ and southern NV where buoyancy and shear may be
locally enhanced beneath the cyclone aloft.

..Lyons.. 05/04/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1125 AM CDT Sun May 04 2025/

...New Mexico and West Texas...
Large-scale ascent will increase this afternoon across NM and the
southern High Plains as strong difluence aloft associated with an
upper low over northwest Mexico and the Southwest moves eastward.
Steep lapse rates aloft atop modest low-level moisture will act in
tandem with daytime heating to foster up to 1000-1250 J/kg of MLCAPE
across eastern NM and far west TX by mid afternoon. While low-level
southeasterly flow will initially be modest, various RAP/NAM
forecast soundings show substantial veering and some strengthening
with height at mid/upper levels. Resultant long/straight hodographs
aloft and strong deep-layer shear will likely support a few
supercells with an attendant threat for large to very large hail (up
to 1.5-2.5 inches in diameter). Isolated severe wind gusts may also
occur as this convection spreads slowly eastward across eastern NM
into parts of west TX through the evening. Although low-level
moisture will remain modest, a southeasterly low-level jet is also
expected to gradually strengthen this evening, which should support
enough 0-1 km SRH for a tornado or two with any sustained supercell.
These thunderstorms will eventually weaken with eastward extent into
west TX as MLCIN gradually increases by mid/late evening.

...Upper Ohio Valley/Mid-Atlantic to the Carolinas...
An expansive closed mid/upper-level low will remain centered over
the OH/TN Valleys today. A belt of stronger south-southwesterly
mid-level winds will overspread parts of the upper OH Valley and
southern Mid-Atlantic through this evening. This enhanced flow along
with upper-level difluence should provide sufficient large-scale
ascent for isolated to scattered convection this afternoon across
parts of OH into WV and western PA. Low-level moisture will remain
somewhat limited across this area, with surface dewpoints generally
in the low to mid 50s. Even with filtered daytime heating, poor
lapse rates aloft should keep any more than weak instability from
developing. Various RAP forecast soundings across this region also
show flow backing with height aloft, which lends considerable
uncertainty regarding convective organization. While an isolated
damaging wind/hail threat may exist, the overall environment should
keep the severe threat fairly marginal.

A somewhat separate area of convection may develop this afternoon
across eastern NC into VA, generally along/ahead of a weak surface
front. While these thunderstorms will have access to greater
low-level moisture, both instability and deep-layer shear are
expected to remain modest. Still, some risk for damaging winds and
hail should exist with any cells or clusters that can develop,
before this activity gradually weakens through the evening with the
loss of daytime heating.

...Florida...
Scattered showers and thunderstorms are ongoing across parts of the
southern/central FL Peninsula. A subtropical upper-level jet should
continue to aid thunderstorm development across the FL Peninsula
through the afternoon. But, persistent cloud cover and poor lapse
rates aloft noted on area 12Z soundings may hinder destabilization
to some degree. Even so, a rather moist low-level airmass exists
along/south of a front over north FL/far southeast GA, and even
modest further heating should support sufficient instability for
surface-based convection. With weak low-level flow gradually veering
to westerly and strengthening at mid/upper levels, this activity
should have enough deep-layer shear for modest updraft organization.
Thunderstorms may preferentially form on/near the Atlantic Coast sea
breeze this afternoon while posing an isolated threat for severe
hail, damaging winds, and perhaps a brief tornado.

...Eastern Idaho into Southern Montana...
As a mid-level trough moves eastward over western Canada and the
northern Rockies, scattered thunderstorms should develop this
afternoon and evening across eastern Idaho into southwest Montana.
This region will have steep mid-level lapse rates and cool
temperatures aloft associated with the shortwave trough. Deep-layer
shear is expected to remain modest, but a couple of stronger cores
with small hail and gusty winds could still occur.

Valid 061200Z - 071200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS CENTRAL
INTO EAST TEXAS AND FAR SOUTHWEST LOUISIANA...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are possible across much of Central into East
Texas and western/central Louisiana. All severe hazards would be
possible.

...OK/TX to LA...

An upper shortwave trough will develop eastward across TX to the
Lower MS Valley on Tuesday. Enhanced deep-layer southwesterly flow
will overspread the region as low-level moist advection aids in a
weakly capped and moderately unstable environment across parts of
central/east TX. A warm front is forecast to slowly lift northward
into north TX/the Red River vicinity. Meanwhile, a dryline will
extend southward across central TX. 

The forecast is complicated by likely ongoing convection Tuesday
morning, both along the warm front and possibly with a remnant
cluster across central Texas. Downstream, dewpoints in the mid 60s
to low 70s F within the warm sector and steep midlevel lapse rates
will result in a corridor of 1500-2500 J/kg MLCAPE. Supercell wind
profiles will support organized convection, though storm mode
remains a bit uncertain. It is possible discrete cells could develop
along the dryline and shift east during the afternoon/evening.
Clustering along the warm front also could result in a developing
MCS. While details remain uncertain, potential for significant
all-hazards severe is possible and outlook upgrades may be needed in
later outlooks.

With northward extent across the Red River Valley into the ArkLaTex,
cooler temperatures to the north of the warm front, and more
widespread precipitation/cloud cover will limit stronger
destabilization. Nevertheless, moderate shear within the warm
frontal zone and steep midlevel lapse rates could support isolated
severe potential in the form of hail and strong gusts.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1215 PM CDT Sun May 04 2025

Valid 051200Z - 061200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS FAR
SOUTHEAST NEW MEXICO INTO SOUTHWEST TEXAS...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are expected from the southern High Plains into
parts of central Texas Monday afternoon and evening. Scattered large
to very large hail and severe winds are the primary threats, though
a couple of tornadoes also are possible. Additional strong to severe
storms are possible along the eastern Florida coast and from
northeast North Carolina to the Lake Erie vicinity.

...Synopsis...

A pair of upper cyclones, one over the Ohio Valley and the other
across the Southwest, will pivot east on Monday. These systems will
support a belt of enhanced mid/upper flow across the southern
Rockies/High Plains and the Mid-Atlantic/Lower Great Lakes. At the
surface, a cold front will stretch from the Mid-Atlantic
south/southwest into north-central FL. Meanwhile, a dryline is
forecast to develop across eastern NM and southwest TX, while a warm
front lifts slowly northward across northwest and central TX. These
features will focus potential for severe thunderstorms Monday
afternoon into the evening/overnight.

...Southeast NM into Central TX...

Southeasterly low-level flow will transport 60s F dewpoints
northwest toward southeast NM into the Trans-Pecos vicinity ahead of
a sharpening dryline. Strong heating along/just behind the dryline
will foster moderate diurnal destabilization as deep-layer flow
strengthens. Forecast hodographs initially will be
elongated/straight through the afternoon and early evening.
Splitting supercells produce large/very large hail are expected with
initial convection. Furthermore, steep low-level lapse rates where
stronger heating occurs also could support strong/severe gusts. 

During the evening, a low-level jet will increase, resulting in
enlarged/curved low-level hodographs. Additional rounds of
supercells may develop as the dryline begins to retreat and stronger
ascent overspreads the region. This activity will continue to pose a
significant hail risk with an increasing risk for a couple of
tornadoes. As the upper low draws closer to the southern Rockies
during the nighttime hours, weak cyclogenesis may occur over far
southwest TX. Additional thunderstorm clusters, possibly growing
upscale into an MCS propagating along the higher theta-e gradient
across west-central to central TX is possible. It is uncertain how
intense this convection may become given multiple rounds of
convection across parts of the area earlier in the day, but some
risk for damaging gusts and a tornado or two will persist.

...OK/TX Panhandle into Northeast NM/southeast CO...

With northward extent across the southern High Plains, northward
moisture return will remain muted, with dewpoints generally in the
40s to low 50s F forecast. Nevertheless, cooling aloft will support
steepening midlevel lapse rates amid strengthening vertical shear.
Isolated large hail and gusty winds may accompany thunderstorm
activity north of the effective warm front in an upslope flow
regime.

...Mid-Atlantic to Lower Great Lakes...

Pockets of heating into the afternoon amid mid 50s to low 60s F
dewpoints, and cold temperatures aloft will support modest
destabilization (up to 1000 J/kg MLCAPE) across the region. Enhanced
midlevel flow will support effective shear values to around 35-45
kt. This should support isolated organized updrafts, with stronger
cells having potential for large hail and locally strong gusts
during the afternoon and early evening.

...FL...

A surface cold front will sag south through the period. Furthermore,
an east coast sea breeze developing ahead of the cold front appears
probable. Strong heating amid mid 60s F dewpoints will aid in
moderate destabilization (MLCAPE up to 2000 J/kg). Cool temperatures
aloft (-10 to -12 C at 500 mb) will support midlevel lapse rates
near 7 C/km. While deep-layer flow will be somewhat weak through 700
mb, vertically veering wind profiles will support around 30 kt
effective shear. Elongated/straight hodographs in conjunction with a
favorable thermodynamic environment suggests isolated hail will be
possible. Steep low-level lapse rates also will support strong
gusts.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
EASTERN NEW MEXICO AND WEST TEXAS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are expected across parts of eastern
New Mexico and west Texas this afternoon and evening. Large to very
large hail, isolated severe wind gusts, and possibly a tornado or
two may occur.

...New Mexico and West Texas...
Large-scale ascent will increase this afternoon across NM and the
southern High Plains as strong difluence aloft associated with an
upper low over northwest Mexico and the Southwest moves eastward.
Steep lapse rates aloft atop modest low-level moisture will act in
tandem with daytime heating to foster up to 1000-1250 J/kg of MLCAPE
across eastern NM and far west TX by mid afternoon. While low-level
southeasterly flow will initially be modest, various RAP/NAM
forecast soundings show substantial veering and some strengthening
with height at mid/upper levels. Resultant long/straight hodographs
aloft and strong deep-layer shear will likely support a few
supercells with an attendant threat for large to very large hail (up
to 1.5-2.5 inches in diameter). Isolated severe wind gusts may also
occur as this convection spreads slowly eastward across eastern NM
into parts of west TX through the evening. Although low-level
moisture will remain modest, a southeasterly low-level jet is also
expected to gradually strengthen this evening, which should support
enough 0-1 km SRH for a tornado or two with any sustained supercell.
These thunderstorms will eventually weaken with eastward extent into
west TX as MLCIN gradually increases by mid/late evening.

...Upper Ohio Valley/Mid-Atlantic to the Carolinas...
An expansive closed mid/upper-level low will remain centered over
the OH/TN Valleys today. A belt of stronger south-southwesterly
mid-level winds will overspread parts of the upper OH Valley and
southern Mid-Atlantic through this evening. This enhanced flow along
with upper-level difluence should provide sufficient large-scale
ascent for isolated to scattered convection this afternoon across
parts of OH into WV and western PA. Low-level moisture will remain
somewhat limited across this area, with surface dewpoints generally
in the low to mid 50s. Even with filtered daytime heating, poor
lapse rates aloft should keep any more than weak instability from
developing. Various RAP forecast soundings across this region also
show flow backing with height aloft, which lends considerable
uncertainty regarding convective organization. While an isolated
damaging wind/hail threat may exist, the overall environment should
keep the severe threat fairly marginal.

A somewhat separate area of convection may develop this afternoon
across eastern NC into VA, generally along/ahead of a weak surface
front. While these thunderstorms will have access to greater
low-level moisture, both instability and deep-layer shear are
expected to remain modest. Still, some risk for damaging winds and
hail should exist with any cells or clusters that can develop,
before this activity gradually weakens through the evening with the
loss of daytime heating.

...Florida...
Scattered showers and thunderstorms are ongoing across parts of the
southern/central FL Peninsula. A subtropical upper-level jet should
continue to aid thunderstorm development across the FL Peninsula
through the afternoon. But, persistent cloud cover and poor lapse
rates aloft noted on area 12Z soundings may hinder destabilization
to some degree. Even so, a rather moist low-level airmass exists
along/south of a front over north FL/far southeast GA, and even
modest further heating should support sufficient instability for
surface-based convection. With weak low-level flow gradually veering
to westerly and strengthening at mid/upper levels, this activity
should have enough deep-layer shear for modest updraft organization.
Thunderstorms may preferentially form on/near the Atlantic Coast sea
breeze this afternoon while posing an isolated threat for severe
hail, damaging winds, and perhaps a brief tornado.

...Eastern Idaho into Southern Montana...
As a mid-level trough moves eastward over western Canada and the
northern Rockies, scattered thunderstorms should develop this
afternoon and evening across eastern Idaho into southwest Montana.
This region will have steep mid-level lapse rates and cool
temperatures aloft associated with the shortwave trough. Deep-layer
shear is expected to remain modest, but a couple of stronger cores
with small hail and gusty winds could still occur.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHWEST NEW MEXICO...

Slight adjustments were made to the D1 Elevated and Critical areas
in New Mexico to remove Catron and Socorro counties where more
recent rainfall has occurred and additional rainfall is possible
today. See previous discussion for more information.

..Thornton.. 05/04/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0135 AM CDT Sun May 04 2025/

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns are expected across parts of the Southwest and
northern Plains this afternoon. Early-morning water-vapor imagery
depict an upper wave over southern CA with a broad zone of ascent
overspreading the Great Basin and Southwest. At the surface,
pressure falls are noted over the Four Corners region and northern
High Plains and should continue well into the afternoon hours as the
upper wave gradually drifts east. Increasing southerly winds across
along both international borders should result in areas of dry/windy
conditions. 

...Southwest New Mexico...
Dewpoints in the low teens are noted in far southeast AZ early this
morning, which appear to be the northwestern periphery of a very dry
air mass in place across northern Mexico based on recent RTMA
analyses. This air mass will spread north through the day as
southerly winds increase in response the surface low development
over the Four Corners region. Afternoon RH minimums in the teens are
likely with 15-25 mph overspreading much of southeast AZ and
southwest NM. Elevated to critical fire weather conditions are
expected over an area with receptive fuels. Dry/windy conditions may
extend well north of the current outline lines, but recent rainfall
and/or the potential for showers/thunderstorms this afternoon should
limit the spatial extent of the threat. 

...North Dakota...
Southerly winds between 15-20 mph are expected across much of the
northern Plains this afternoon as a surface trough deepens along the
northern High Plains. A recent frontal intrusion into the Gulf has
shunted appreciable moisture well south into the southern Plains,
limiting the potential for moisture return over the next 12 hours.
Additionally, unseasonably warm high temperatures are forecast for
today (into the 80s), which will support RH reductions to near 20%.
Elevated to critical fire weather conditions are likely - especially
along and north of the Highway 2 corridor where recent HRRR/RAP runs
(which typically handle dry return flow regimes well) show the
highest potential for sustained 20 mph winds. Although much of the
region has received some rainfall within the past week, local fuel
and fire reports indicate that dry/dead grasses remain in the fuel
landscape and should support fire spread.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS EASTERN NEW
MEXICO AND FAR WEST TEXAS...

...SUMMARY...
Strong to potentially severe storms are expected across east-central
and southeast New Mexico and far west Texas this afternoon and
evening, with a threat for large hail, isolated severe wind gusts,
and possibly a tornado. Other strong to locally severe storms are
possible from Florida northward into the Mid-Atlantic and Allegheny
Plateau.

...New Mexico/West Texas...
In advance of the upper trough over the Southwest Deserts,
increasing height falls and strongly diffluent flow aloft will
overspread a modestly moist boundary layer with prevalent 40s to
near 50F surface dewpoints. Beneath steep mid-level lapse rates,
upwards of 500-1000 J/kg MLCAPE is expected by late afternoon.
Scattered thunderstorms are expected across northern into
east-central New Mexico, with more isolated storms expected into far
southeast New Mexico and west Texas. Wind profiles veering with
height and increasing mid-level southwesterly winds will provide
sufficient deep-layer shear for storm organization, including the
probable development of a few supercells. Large hail and localized
severe wind gusts will be possible. In addition, enlarging low-level
hodographs and gradually improving low-level moisture could support
a tornado or two if any mature supercells can persist through late
afternoon into the evening.

...Florida...
A cluster of storms across the north-central Peninsula, and to a
lesser extent across the south-central Peninsula, may pose a
localized severe risk as they continue eastward today. Existing
cloud cover may tend to somewhat mute more robust heating, but
gradual destabilization should still occur particularly along the
east coast, which will also probably influence storm development.
Effective shear of 25-30 kt will support potentially organized
storms capable of hail and isolated damaging gusts, and some tornado
threat may exist particularly in the vicinity of the sea breeze or
any other boundaries.

...Allegheny Plateau into the Carolinas...
East of the semi-stacked/closed low, cloud breaks and cold
temperatures aloft should support modest diurnal destabilization
across parts of Ohio and West Virginia into western Pennsylvania.
Storm development should be aided one or more low-amplitude
vorticity maxima rotating around the midlevel cyclone amidst
diffluent flow aloft. Low-level winds are expected to remain rather
weak, but modestly veering wind profiles and moderate mid-level flow
could support some storm organization, if sufficient buoyancy can be
realized. Hail and locally gusty winds could accompany the strongest
storms, and a corridor of higher severe probabilities (Slight Risk
caliber) may be warranted if a scenario with somewhat greater
destabilization appears likely.

Farther south into the Carolinas and parts of the Mid-Atlantic
region, somewhat stronger diurnal heating is expected, and MLCAPE
may increase to near/above 1000 J/kg. However, storm coverage is
more uncertain, with a notable mid-level dry slot and only weak to
modest large-scale ascent expected with southward extent. Any storms
that can mature within this environment could become modestly
organized with a threat of isolated hail and damaging gusts. 

...Eastern Idaho/southwest Montana...
Scattered storm development is expected this afternoon and evening
across eastern Idaho into southwest Montana, within an environment
characterized by cool temperatures aloft and steep lapse rates.
Deep-layer shear will be relatively modest, but a few stronger
storms with small hail and gusty winds could occur. Subsequent
outlooks will reevaluate the need for a potential introduction of
low-end severe probabilities.

Mesoscale Discussion 0677
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0547 AM CDT Sun May 04 2025

Areas affected...eastern North Carolina into far southeast Virginia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 041047Z - 041345Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated strong gusts, and perhaps a brief/weak tornado,
cannot be ruled out over eastern North Carolina and eventually into
far southeast Virginia.

DISCUSSION...A line of convection with wind shift continues to push
east, now completely out of SC and over eastern NC. Earlier, a 50 kt
gust was measured near North Myrtle Beach. 

In addition to the narrow north-south line of convection, other
storms have developed ahead of the line. These storms have shown
periodic weak mesocyclones. Other storms continue to show
near-severe inbound velocities mainly over the water, but this
activity may eventually move inland.

The air mass is marginally unstable, but sufficient for isolated
severe reports this morning. Low-level SRH with 0-1 km values of
100-150 m2/s2 will continue to favor rotation within the stronger
storms, though any tornado risk should remain low-end in nature.
