Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0746 AM CDT Thu Apr 10 2025

Valid 101300Z - 111200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM PORTIONS OF
THE LOWER OH VALLEY INTO THE DEEP SOUTH...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong-severe thunderstorms are expected from portions of
the lower Ohio Valley into the Deep South this afternoon. Hail and
wind are the primary concerns.

...Synopsis...
Broad upper troughing is forecast to shift eastward across the
eastern CONUS today, as a series of embedded shortwave trough
progress through its base. The lead wave in this series is currently
moving through Lower/Middle OH Valley with a second wave farther
back northwest across the Upper Midwest/Mid MO Valley. This second
wave, which is accompanied by an 80 kt 500 mb jet streak, is
expected to continue southeastward throughout the day, reaching the
Mid-South vicinity by this evening before continuing more eastward
into southern Appalachians by early Friday. 

Surface pattern preceding this upper troughing will be somewhat
disorganized and broad, with one weak low moving northeastward
across the Upper OH Valley and another moving southeastward across
the Mid MS Valley and KY/TN. A diffuse cold front is forecast to
shift southeastward across the OH Valley into the Mid-South and
eventually the Southeast. Strong to severe thunderstorms are
anticipated in the vicinity of this front throughout the afternoon
and evening. 

...Mid-South/TN and OH Valleys into the Southeast...
Area soundings reveal the steep mid-level lapse rates (i.e. greater
than 7 deg C per km) extend throughout much of the region, supported
by a large area of cold mid-level temperatures (-18 to -24 deg C at
500 mb). These cold mid-level temperatures will help support airmass
destabilization and modest buoyancy ahead of the approaching
shortwave trough and cold front, despite relatively modest low-level
moisture. Forcing for ascent along the front, as well as more broad
large-scale ascent, will interact with this destabilized airmass to
support thunderstorm development across much of the region this
afternoon. Thunderstorm coverage will likely be maximized along the
front, but initiation could also occur elsewhere across the region
given the broad ascent and large destabilized area. 

Deep mixing is anticipated across the region, resulting in a
thermodynamic profile that is somewhat unique for this part of the
country. This profile will result in high-based thunderstorms
capable of producing strong cold pools, particularly given that
shear is quite strong and updraft organization is likely. Primary
factor precluding greater severe potential is the limited low-level
moisture and resulting modest buoyancy. That being said, the long
hodographs suggest storms could be efficient at producing hail
during their initially more discrete stage, with a trend towards
cold pool amalgamation thereafter. Consequently, several bowing
segments could develop, each with the potential to produce damaging
gusts.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0333 AM CDT Thu Apr 10 2025

Valid 131200Z - 181200Z

...DISCUSSION...
Primary feature of interest will be a shortwave trough over MT at
12Z Sunday and its major amplification into a broad eastern
CONUS/southeast Canadian trough through mid-week. Poleward moisture
quality from the western Gulf will remain sub-optimal, but will
improve through D5/Monday. The northeast extent of weak surface
buoyancy should reach the OH Valley by Monday afternoon, where
guidance has been trending farther south with an intense mid-level
jet. Given a prior EML and the deep surface cyclone tracking over
Lake Superior to central ON vicinity, convective coverage may be
limited along the trailing cold front. Still, consensus of guidance
suggests that some fast-moving convection should accompany the
portion of the front in the OH Valley vicinity. Robust 700-500 mb
wind profiles should offer at least a threat for damaging winds. 

Depending upon timing of frontal passage, a limited-area severe
threat may exist on D6/Tuesday along the Southeast Atlantic coast. A
compact southern-stream shortwave impulse, approaching the backside
of the broad east CONUS trough, indicates low-probability severe
potential over the southern Great Plains on D7/Wednesday into the
western Gulf Coast vicinity D8/Thursday.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1219 AM CDT Thu Apr 10 2025

Valid 111200Z - 121200Z

...Synopsis...
A near-stationary mid-level trough will amplify along the East Coast
as upper ridging continues to build over the central U.S. and
another mid-level trough traverses the Pacific Northwest tomorrow
(Friday). Ahead of the approaching Northwest mid-level trough,
surface lee troughing will take place across the central and
northern High Plains, supporting strong southerly flow in the
process. A dry airmass will be transported northward across the
northern High Plains, with 15-25 mph sustained southerly winds
overlapping with 15-25 percent RH tomorrow afternoon. Elevated
highlights have been introduced given dry/windy conditions
overlapping at least marginally to modestly dry fuels.

Meanwhile, a surface cold front is expected to sweep across the
Florida Peninsula tomorrow, with dry/breezy conditions likely in the
post-frontal regime. Winds may sustain over 15 mph for at least a
few hours during the afternoon, as RH dips as low as 20-30 percent
in some areas. Rainfall accumulations have barely exceeded 0.25
inches over the past week for most parts of the central Florida
Peninsula, and given the presence of dry fuels, Elevated highlights
have been introduced.

Isolated thunderstorms remain possible through tonight from parts of
the northern/central Plains into the Midwest and Ohio Valley and
eastern FL. Severe thunderstorms are not expected.

Only minor changes were made to the thunder areas across parts of NE
and MT for the latest guidance and ongoing storms. Severe
thunderstorms are unlikely, see the prior discussion.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1115 AM CDT Wed Apr 09 2025/

...Synopsis and Discussion...
Multiple low-amplitude, mid-level shortwave troughs are forecast to
develop east-southeastward today and tonight from parts of the
northern/central Plains into the Midwest and OH Valley. Rather
meager/shallow low-level moisture will tend to limit thunderstorm
coverage and intensity across these regions. Even so, sufficient
large-scale ascent and weak MUCAPE may still support isolated
convection capable of producing lightning through the period.
Occasional strong/gusty winds may occur with high-based
thunderstorms across parts of SD/NE this afternoon, but organized
severe thunderstorms are not forecast.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
EASTERN CAROLINAS AND FAR SOUTHEAST VIRGINIA....

...SUMMARY...
A couple strong to severe storms will be possible from the eastern
Carolinas into southeast Virginia on Friday. Primary concerns will
be isolated severe hail and locally damaging wind gusts.

...Discussion...
A strong mid-level jet streak will round the base of the trough on
Friday morning resulting in a deepening, negatively tilted mid-level
shortwave trough across the southern Appalachians. As a result, a
surface low will deepen across the central Carolinas Friday morning.
As this occurs, upper 50s to low 60s dewpoints over the Gulf Stream
will advect inland across eastern South Carolina and North Carolina
and perhaps far as southeast Virginia. Cooling temperatures aloft
and steepening mid-level lapse rates will aid in destabilization
Friday morning. If some surface heating can occur and allow for a
zone of greater instability (1000+ J/kg MLCAPE) to develop, a slight
risk may be needed. The most favorable zone at this time extends
from northeast South Carolina into eastern North Carolina where
cloudcover/stabilizing rainfall is less likely.

There is still some uncertainty regarding the timing and location of
the mid-level jet max and as a result, the location of the surface
low. These differences are only 50 to 100 miles, but given how close
the threat is to the coast, this could have a significant impact on
inland destabilization and thus the potential for a corridor of
greater severe risk. This, combined with cloudcover/ongoing
convective concerns mentioned above, preclude higher probabilities
at this time.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR PORTIONS OF
THE MID-MISSISSIPPI VALLEY TO NORTHERN GEORGIA...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe storms capable of producing large hail and damaging
gusts will be possible across portions of the Mid/Deep South and
Tennessee Valley on Thursday.

...Synopsis...
On Thursday, an elongated, strong mid-level jet streak across the
central Plains will help amplify the trough across the eastern
CONUS. Very cold mid-level temperatures (-25 to -26C at 500mb) will
overspread the Mid-Mississippi Valley into the Tennessee Valley. At
the surface, lower/middle 50s F dewpoints will stream northeastward
along/ahead of a southeastward-moving cold front.

...Mid/Deep South and Tennessee Valley...
Ahead of a southward moving surface front, low-level moistening and
substantial diurnal heating will result in moderate instability
(1000 to 1500 J/kg MLCAPE) from Arkansas into Tennessee, with weaker
destabilization farther northeast into the Lower Ohio River Valley.
A broad region of ascent will develop across the warm sector by
early Thursday afternoon within the left exit region of the
upper-level jet streak. This should result in scattered
thunderstorms from Arkansas/Missouri to Indiana, eastern Kentucky
and perhaps southern Ohio. The best overlap between the greatest
instability and shear will be from eastern Arkansas eastward to
northern Georgia where the slight risk is present. 

Long/straight hodographs will initially support splitting supercells
with a threat for large hail. In addition, these supercells will
have some wind threat given the steep lapse rates and well-mixed
boundary layer. This thermodynamic profile will support eventual
upscale growth into one or more line segments with a primary
damaging wind threat expected by late afternoon and into the
evening.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE CENTRAL HIGH
PLAINS...

Short term model guidance continues to indicate high-based but
isolated thunderstorm development across portions of Nebraska
through the afternoon. The isolated convection will quickly move
southeastward at 35-45 mph, limiting rainfall while also producing
gusty surface winds associated owing to a fairly dry sub-cloud
layer. Therefore, Isolated Dry Thunderstorm highlights were
introduced into north-central into southeastern portions of
Nebraska.

Elevated highlights were expanded slightly into western Kansas
accounting for a more broad area of enhanced northwest winds within
a dry post-frontal air mass. Similarly in Florida, modest northerly
surface winds nearly parallel to the lower Florida Peninsula
combined with afternoon relative humidity dropping into the 25-35
percent range will allow for Elevated fire weather conditions this
afternoon. The driest boundary layer conditions will be concentrated
along the western Florida peninsula through this afternoon where the
Elevated highlights were added.

..Williams/Moore.. 04/09/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1143 PM CDT Tue Apr 08 2025/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will begin to amplify over the Ohio Valley as
upper ridging builds in over the Interior West today. By afternoon,
an 80+ kt 500 mb jet streak will overspread a dry boundary layer
over the central/northern Plains. Downward momentum transport within
this dry boundary layer will support 15-20 mph sustained
northwesterly surface winds amid 20 percent RH. Given dry fuels
across the central/northern Plains, Elevated highlights have been
introduced where guidance consensus depicts the aforementioned
dry/windy conditions persisting for several hours. Guidance
consensus also depicts 20-25 mph sustained northwesterly surface
winds coinciding with 10-15 percent RH across portions of the
central High Plains, where Critical highlights are in place. 

Additionally, by afternoon, buoyancy (albeit scant) may support
isolated, fast-moving/high-based thunderstorms over the same
portions of the central Plains that will experience dry/windy
surface conditions atop dry fuels. However, thunderstorms should be
sparse at best over most areas, and it is unclear where a locally
higher density of lightning flashes may occur, hence no isolated dry
thunderstorms highlights introduced this outlook.

Areas affected...Central/southeast Georgia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 072047Z - 072145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Some increase in convection may be sustained along the
deeper wind shift/cold front, but severe storms appear unlikely.

DISCUSSION...West of the pre-frontal convection, a recent increase
in updraft depth/intensity has occurred across central GA.  This
deepening convection appears to be along the deeper wind shift, with
a band of ascent impinging on residual moisture in the wake of
earlier convection.  However, the prior convection cooled surface
temperatures, lapse rates are poor, and vertical shear has
weakened/become more unidirectional with time, and shear vectors are
primarily parallel to the line orientation.  Thus, the storms are
expected to remain largely sub-severe, and an additional watch or
watch extension appears unnecessary.

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 134...

Valid 072035Z - 072130Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 134
continues.

SUMMARY...The damaging wind threat continues across WW134, primarily
with the band of storms moving over eastern NC and southern VA.
However, additional storms remain possible farther south.

DISCUSSION...As of 2040 UTC, regional radar imagery shows an
organized linear cluster of thunderstorms ongoing from far
southeastern VA into eastern NC. Over the last 2 hours, several
reports of wind damage, and measured severe gusts have been reported
with the line segment across parts of VA and NC. This appears likely
to continue to the coast as the line segment moves east-northeast at
50 kt.

Farther south, lingering cloud cover has resulted in only isolated
weak convection and showers across parts of SC. Some recent CA
guidance suggests a few stronger cells may eventually emerge closer
to the coast where heating has been more pronounced. A damaging wind
gusts threat could evolve with any deeper connective cells that
become established in the next couple of hours as the primary cold
front continues to shift east.

Areas affected...parts of swrn through e cntrl GA...wrn and cntrl SC

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 071240Z - 071445Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...At least low probabilities for an additional tornado or
two and/or locally damaging surface gusts continues in scattered
thunderstorm activity overspread the region through 10-11 AM EDT. 
It is still not clear that a severe weather watch is needed in the
near term, but trends will continue to be monitored for this
possibility.

DISCUSSION...Stronger boundary-layer instability, characterized by
CAPE near or above 1000 J/kg, still remains confined to a narrow
pre-frontal corridor across the western Florida Panhandle through
southwestern into southern portions of central GA.  However, some
cooling loft appears to be contributing to at least weak
destabilization north-northeastward toward the South Carolina
Piedmont.

The front, with a couple of weak waves along it, will continue a
slow eastward progression through mid to late morning, with the
Rapid Refresh indicating that a moderate south-southwesterly
low-level jet (in excess of 40 kt around 850 mb) will maintain
sizable, clockwise-curved low-level hodographs within the
instability axis.

Cloud cover spreading downstream of the stronger ongoing convective
development probably will slow boundary-layer destabilization, and
it is not certain that there will be a substantive further increase
in thunderstorm intensities in the near term.  However, the MCV,
which apparently recently contributed to a tornado south-southwest
of the Greater Atlanta area, continues east-northeastward toward the
South Carolina Piedmont, and it not clear that the downstream
environment will not support an additional relatively short-lived
tornado or two.  Farther south, in the corridor of better
instability, focused along the low-level jet axis near/north and
east of the Albany into Macon vicinities, there may also be
continuing potential for short-lived intensification of
meso-vortices embedded with the ongoing narrow band of convection.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0348 PM CDT Sun Apr 06 2025

Areas affected...parts of southern AL...southwest/central GA...into
the western FL Panhandle

Concerning...Tornado Watch 132...

Valid 062048Z - 062215Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 132 continues.

SUMMARY...Several bands of strong to severe storms will remain
capable of damaging gusts and a couple tornadoes. Some local
extensions of WW132 may be needed, but the downstream threat appears
more limited.

DISCUSSION...As of 2040 UTC, regional radar observations indicate a
band of convection across southeastern AL and west-central GA
continues to show embedded supercell and bowing structures capable
of damaging gusts and tornadoes. This should continue for a couple
more hours as storms approach the eastern edge of the Tornado Watch
132. Areal extensions of a few counties may be needed as storms
begin to outrun the watch. As storms continue farther east, a
gradual decrease in buoyancy should favor weakening into the evening
hours. Until then, damaging gusts and a couple tornadoes remain
possible.

To the southwest, a second smaller band of convection across
southern AL will likely maintain intensity for a few more hours this
afternoon. A few more isolated cells have also developed farther
east within the warm sector across southwest GA and the northern FL
Panhandle. 1500-2000 J/kg of MLCAPE and 40+ kt of effective shear
could support a continued severe threat into this evening. This
matches with some hi-res guidance that shows a gradual expansion of
strong storms into southwest GA and possibly northern FL. However,
forcing for ascent is some what nebulous and storm coverage has
remained more isolated thus far. With storms approaching the
southeast corner of WW132 in the next few hours, some consideration
may be given to a small downstream watch. However the extent of the
severe risk and need for any new watches is currently unclear.

Mesoscale Discussion 0425
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0734 AM CDT Sun Apr 06 2025

Areas affected...parts of sern MS through cntrl AL

Concerning...Tornado Watch 131...

Valid 061234Z - 061430Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 131 continues.

SUMMARY...Convection may continue to undergo further organization
and intensification through 9-10 AM CDT, accompanied by increasing
risk for strong surface gusts, and a continuing risk for tornadoes.

DISCUSSION...At least a bit broader, lower/mid-tropospheric cyclonic
circulation appears to be evolving, perhaps including a surface
meso-low now migrating east-northeastward into/across the Demopolis
AL vicinity.  Latest Rapid Refresh now indicates a more prominent
south-southwesterly speed maximum associated with this feature,
including 50+ kt in the 850-700 mb layer.  Although moisture
characterized by mid 60s+ surface dew points across central Alabama,
between Montgomery and Birmingham still appear to supporting only
modest CAPE (around 500 J/kg sampled in 12Z BMX sounding), low-level
moisture advection and at least some boundary layer warming are
likely to contribute to further destabilization in advance of the
convection during the next few hours.  Inflow of this air mass may
be sufficient to support at least a gradual further intensification
of activity during the next few hours, accompanied by increasing
potential for strong surface gusts and a few tornadoes. 

Discrete thunderstorm development is also being maintained near/just
ahead of the southern flank of the evolving convective system, and
the occasional intensification of these cells, before merging into
the line, may also be accompanied by increasing potential for a
tornado near the Selma/Montgomery vicinities through mid morning.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 131
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
245 AM CDT Sun Apr 6 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Central and Southwest Alabama
  Northwest Georgia
  Far Southeast Mississippi

* Effective this Sunday morning from 245 AM until 1000 AM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A couple tornadoes possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms continue to gradually move southeastward
across the Southeast States. Low-level wind fields remain strong,
supporting the potential for damaging gusts and line-embedded
tornadoes. Additionally, there is also some chance for a few storms
ahead of the main line. Environmental conditions suggest that any
persistent discrete storms could become supercellular and capable of
producing damaging gusts and tornadoes.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 45 statute miles
north and south of a line from 135 miles southwest of Birmingham AL
to 15 miles southeast of Rome GA. For a complete depiction of the
watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU1).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 128...WW 129...WW 130...

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 1.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 60 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean
storm motion vector 24035.
