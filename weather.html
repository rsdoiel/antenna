Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0359 AM CST Fri Jan 24 2025

Valid 271200Z - 011200Z

...DISCUSSION...
On Monday/Day 4, a shortwave ridge is forecast over the
south-central U.S. The overall pattern is forecast to gradually
amplify on Tuesday/Day 5 and Wednesday/Day 6, as a mid-level low
moves slowly eastward across the Desert Southwest. Ahead of the
system, moisture return is expected across the southern Plains in
the early to mid week, as mid-level flow becomes southwesterly. A
moist airmass is forecast to become established across the southern
Plains by Wednesday, with scattered thunderstorms likely to develop
in the afternoon and evening across parts of Texas and Oklahoma. The
potential for convective development is expected to continue into
Thursday/Day 7 and Thursday night as the mid-level system approaches
and moves into the southern Plains. At this time, model forecasts
suggest that instability, lift and deep-layer shear could support an
isolated severe threat in parts of Texas and possibly southern
Oklahoma, from Wednesday evening into Thursday. However, there is
still substantial variance among solutions concerning this system,
and confidence is low concerning magnitude and spacing. At this
time, it appears the overall severe threat will remain marginal. On
Friday/Day 8, the potential for convection is forecast to move
eastward into parts of the Southeast, where little instability is
forecast.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0134 AM CST Fri Jan 24 2025

Valid 251200Z - 261200Z

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns are expected to emerge across portions of
Arizona by Saturday afternoon as low-level winds increase in
response to a deepening upper wave along the West Coast. The
breakdown of an upper ridge over the West Coast is underway ahead of
an approaching trough based on recent water-vapor imagery and
upper-air analyses. Broad surface pressure falls are anticipated
across the greater inter-mountain West/High Plains over the next 24
hours, but will intensify over the Southwest through Saturday as the
upper wave deepens along the southern CA coast. Recent forecast
guidance suggests south/southeasterly winds between 15-25 mph will
be likely - especially in the lee/northern slopes of the Mogollon
Rim and across south-central AZ by late afternoon. 

Extensive mid/high-level cloud cover is anticipated through much of
the day as mid-level isentropic ascent increases ahead of the
deepening upper trough. However, 07 UTC surface observations sampled
a very dry air mass across southern to central AZ characterized by
dewpoints between -5 to -15 F. Consequently, even muted diurnal
heating should promote RH reductions into the single digits to low
teens, which will support elevated to locally critical fire weather
conditions. Recent fuel analyses show ERC values generally
near/above the 80th percentile - likely the result of 30-day
rainfall totals between 2 to 5% of normal, which should support the
fire weather concern.

Mesoscale Discussion 0048
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0846 AM CST Tue Jan 21 2025

Areas affected...Southeast Louisiana...southern Mississippi and far
southern Alabama

Concerning...Heavy snow 

Valid 211446Z - 211845Z

SUMMARY...Moderate to heavy snow to continue this morning and
through the afternoon. Some blowing and drifting is also expected.

DISCUSSION...An expansive region of light to occasionally moderate
snow has spread across much of the central Gulf coast this morning.
Expect precipitation rates to increase through the late morning and
afternoon with widespread moderate to occasionally heavy snowfall
rates expected. In addition, some stronger winds, particularly
closer to the coast will lead to some blowing and drifting. Areas
with northward exposure (ex. southern short of Lake Pontchartrain)
may see some localized blizzard conditions through the day. 

Some mixed precipitation is being observed from southern Terrebonne
Parish to southern St. Bernard Parish where a warm nose (seen just
below 700mb on the LIX 12Z RAOB) is slightly above freezing. 60
knots of southwesterly flow in this warm nose will attempt to
maintain its presence across the region while temperatures aloft
continue to cool. Expect the cold air to eventually win out with
snow likely across all of southern Louisiana by later this
afternoon.

Mesoscale Discussion 0047
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0447 AM CST Tue Jan 21 2025

Areas affected...Far southeast Texas into south-central Louisiana

Concerning...Heavy snow 

Valid 211047Z - 211515Z

SUMMARY...Moderate snowfall with embedded heavier bands will become
more likely over the next several hours in southern Louisiana.

DISCUSSION...The broad upper-level trough across the central/eastern
U.S. is in the process of intensifying this morning. As this occurs,
the upper-level jet along eastern flank of the trough will also
intensify. Increasing mid/upper-level ascent as well as at least
weak lower-level frontogenesis (850-700 mb or so) will promote
favorable conditions for dendritic growth. Moderate snowfall has
already been observed at several stations in southwestern Louisiana
over the last hour. With the most favorable synoptic conditions
expected to occur around mid/late morning, moderate snowfall should
become increasingly prevalent across southern Louisiana in
particular. Some banded structures will be possible which could
produce heavier snowfall rates (0.5-1 in/hr) at least locally.

Mesoscale Discussion 0038
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1200 PM CST Sun Jan 19 2025

Areas affected...Portions of Mid-Atlantic States

Concerning...Heavy snow 

Valid 191800Z - 192230Z

SUMMARY...Snowfall will continue to increase from southwest to
northeast across portions of West Virginia, Maryland, and
Pennsylvania this afternoon with rates exceeding 1" per hour.

DISCUSSION...An upper-level trough and associated speed max rotating
around a low near Hudson Bay are moving toward the East Coast this
afternoon.  In response at the surface, a low over North Carolina is
forecast to deepen and shift northeastward through the afternoon. 
To the north to northwest of the surface low, low-level
frontogenesis will promote upward vertical motion and precipitation
banding.  Given these favorable factors and cold vertical profiles,
snowfall rates of >=1" per hour are likely this afternoon with
higher rates possible in banded structures.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0104 PM CST Sun Jan 19 2025

Valid 211200Z - 221200Z

...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms are not forecast on Tuesday or Tuesday night.

...Synopsis...
Thunderstorm potential largely appears negligible across the CONUS
through Tuesday night. An exception could be along the Gulf Coast.
Shallow and highly elevated convection, predominately producing
sleet at the surface, should be ongoing at 12Z Tuesday along the
northwest Gulf Coast. Mid-level lapse rates will be progressively
weaker with eastern extent downstream, suggesting that lightning
production will likely be nonexistent along the north-central to
eastern Gulf Coast. Primary deep convective potential should be
confined from the west-central to southeast Gulf through the period.

1118 AM CST Sun Jan 19 2025

Valid 201200Z - 211200Z

...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms are not forecast on Monday or Monday night.

...Synopsis...
Thunderstorm potential is negligible across the CONUS on Monday
through Monday night. One exception could be from the Middle TX to
southwest LA Gulf Coast where weak elevated convection should
develop early morning Tuesday. This will occur with strengthening
warm-moist advection centered on 750-700 mb, downstream of a
positive-tilt mid/upper-level longwave trough. Some CAM/non-CAM 12Z
forecast soundings, most aggressively from the NAM, depict scant
elevated buoyancy developing amid a plume of initially steep
mid-level lapse rates. With thermodynamic profiles suggestive of a
predominant PTYPE of sleet at the surface, these potentially
mixed-phase elevated parcels could support a few lightning flashes.
While thunderstorm probabilities may be nonzero, they appear to be
less than 10 percent at this time.

1018 AM CST Sun Jan 19 2025

Valid 191630Z - 201200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE CENTRAL
FLORIDA PENINSULA...

...SUMMARY...
Strong thunderstorms may impact parts of central Florida this
morning into this afternoon, and pose at least some risk for a
tornado and locally damaging wind gusts.

...FL Peninsula...
Expansive upper troughing covers the entirety of the CONUS this
morning, with moderate southwesterly flow aloft throughout the base
of this trough extending from the Southeast/Gulf of Mexico across
the Mid-Atlantic States and FL. Surface analysis places a low over
central NC. A cold front extends southwestward from this low through
southeast GA and the FL Big Bend. Modest troughing precedes this
front across central FL, with broad low-level confluence in the
vicinity of this pre-frontal troughing contributing to showers and
thunderstorms. Modest buoyancy persists over the region, with
mesoanalysis estimating MLCAPE around 500 to 750 J/kg.

Showers and thunderstorms are expected to continue throughout the
day as the cold front and pre-frontal troughing both shift gradually
southward. The environment will remain strongly sheared (i.e.
effective bulk shear around 50-55 kt) throughout the afternoon,
supporting the potential for a few more organized storms capable of
damaging wind gusts and perhaps even a brief tornado or two. Wind
fields will weaken with southern extent, with deep-layer vertical
shear weakening as well. As such, the severe potential will likely
maximize this morning into the early afternoon across the central FL
Peninsula.
