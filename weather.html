Tropical Depression One-C Discussion Number   3
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 AM HST Sun Jul 27 2025
 
The system continues to become better organized this morning, with 
deep convection in curved banding generally to the west of the 
center. Recent imagery shows that convection has been developing the 
last few hours near the low-level center, with some increased 
curvature. Subjective Dvorak satellite intensity estimates from HFO 
and SAB were T/2.0 this cycle. A scatterometer pass is expected 
shortly which should give a better idea of the surface winds. Using 
the Dvorak estimates, the intensity is held at 30 kt.
 
The system is moving westward at about 270/10 kt. A westward motion 
is expected the next several days as the cyclone moves on the south 
side of a mid-level ridge. There continues to be some spread in the 
along track guidance, although there is high confidence on the 
system remaining well south of the Hawaiian islands. The NHC track 
forecast is similar to the previous, and lies closest to the HCCA 
corrected consensus aids.
 
Environmental conditions appear favorable for some gradual 
strengthening the next couple of days. The hurricane regional models 
remain at the higher end of the guidance envelope, and the latest 
NHC forecast is near the previous. Beyond 48 h, a gradual weakening 
trend should begin as the system moves over slightly cooler sea 
surface temperatures, a drier airmass, and vertical wind shear is 
expected to increase. The gradual weakening trend will cause the 
system to become a remnant low by day 5, potentially even opening 
into a trough.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0300 PM CDT Sun Jul 27 2025

Valid 272000Z - 281200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS
SOUTHERN/CENTRAL MINNESOTA AND FAR EASTERN SOUTH DAKOTA...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
MID-ATLANTIC STATES...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are expected this afternoon and evening across
parts of the Upper Midwest to western Great Lakes. Other severe
storms are also possible in parts of the northern Plains, central
Appalachians, and Mid-Atlantic.

...20Z Update...
Both the Slight and Enhanced risks were expanded slightly
west-southwestward in eastern SD with this update. Here, the latest
guidance has come into relatively good agreement, depicting
convective development ahead of a gradually evolving surface low
into this evening. Very steep deep-layer lapse rates/extreme
surface-based buoyancy and 40-50 kt of effective shear will promote
supercells/organized clusters capable of producing large hail and
severe wind gusts. 

Farther east, the Marginal risk was expanded southward across
southeastern NC into northern SC. Strong heating/destabilization
will promote damaging wind gusts with any small thunderstorm
clusters that evolve.

..Weinman.. 07/27/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1200 PM CDT Sun Jul 27 2025/

...Upper Midwest/western Great Lakes including MN/eastern SD...
A convectively enhanced mid-level shortwave trough over
northern/eastern North Dakota will continue generally eastward
toward northern Minnesota, with a modest flattening of the
downstream upper-level ridge into tonight. A modest deepening of the
surface low will occur across eastern South Dakota toward the
southwest Minnesota border vicinity, with intense thunderstorm
development later today generally expected to focus along the
southeastward-advancing front, although differential heating and a
convectively aided cluster/possible MCV across northeast South
Dakota at midday may also be factors. 

Given the strong buoyancy near/south of the front, and very steep
lapse rates/elevated mixed layer impinging from the west-southwest,
modestly strong wind profiles will be sufficient for intense
supercell development with initial storms, including large hail
potential (higher magnitudes possible especially eastern South
Dakotas and southwest Minnesota) and some tornado risk. Multiple
southeastward-moving clusters should evolve this evening with an
increasing likelihood of damaging wind across southern Minnesota
into western/northern Wisconsin. Portions of the region have been
upgraded to an Enhanced Risk. 

...Mid-Atlantic/Central Appalachians...
Scattered afternoon thunderstorms will continue to increase
regionally. Similar to previous days, mid-level lapse rates will be
weak and considerable mid-level moisture will keep the overall
potential somewhat limited/isolated. However, the strongest cells
will be capable of occasional gusty/damaging winds, with a somewhat
higher probability of wind damage seemingly existing across eastern
Virginia where buoyancy will be greater.

...Montana...
Strong heating will occur this afternoon across much of
central/eastern Montana, where deep boundary-layer mixing will lead
to inverted-v profiles. Scattered thunderstorms are forecast to
develop along a corridor from southwest into central Montana by late
afternoon. These high-based storms may pose a risk of a few
severe-caliber wind gusts.

Mesoscale Discussion 1811
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0257 PM CDT Sun Jul 27 2025

Areas affected...central/eastern North Carolina...southern Virginia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 271957Z - 272200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered thunderstorm activity will promote a few
instances of strong to severe wind this afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Scattered thunderstorm activity has increased in
coverage across portions of eastern North Carolina this afternoon.
The air mass in this region is very hot and unstable, but deep layer
shear for a more organized severe threat remains weak. Given the
deep moisture and strong instability, a few wet downbursts may
produce some instances of strong to severe wind. Overall, this
threat will remain too isolated for watch issuance.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0218 PM CDT Sun Jul 27 2025

Valid 291200Z - 301200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM MONTANA
INTO THE CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS EASTWARD TO PARTS OF THE
MID-MISSISSIPPI VALLEY...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are possible from southern Montana into the
central High Plains as well as parts of the Mid-Missouri and
Mid-Mississippi Valleys on Tuesday.

...Central Plains to Mid-MS Valley vicinity...

Another day of severe storms/MCS potential will exist on Tuesday.
However, uncertainty remains high given several rounds of severe
storms expected over the coming days prior to Tuesday/Day 3.
However, the severe risk appears to be shunted a bit south compared
to prior days, with southern SD/NE into IA and southern WI/northern
IL the more likely corridor for severe potential on Tuesday. 

Convection may be ongoing across parts of WI/IL Tuesday morning. Any
outflow associated with this system could become a focus for
redevelopment during the afternoon. Further west, a surface low will
be located over southern NE/KS with a cold front somewhere in the
vicinity of northeast CO/western NE Tuesday morning. The surface
low/front and where the cold front possibly intersects the outflow
boundary further east also will be a focus for severe thunderstorm
development. Stronger westerly flow aloft will likely remain
somewhat displaced from the corridor of favorable
thermodynamics/low-level moisture and surface boundaries.
Nevertheless, storms producing large hail and damaging/severe gusts
appear likely somewhere within the broad region from the central
Plains to the Mid-MS/Lake Michigan vicinity.  Given uncertainty,
will maintain the Marginal risk (level 1 of 5), but a corridor of
greater potential will likely emerge in the coming day or two. 

...MT into the Central High Plains...

Abundant boundary layer moisture will persist even in the wake of
the surface front from MT into eastern WY, western SD/NE and
northeast CO. The low-level upslope flow regime will support
thunderstorm development near higher terrain initially. This
activity should intensify as it moves off higher terrain into a
corridor of moderate to strong instability by late afternoon/early
evening. Effective shear will be strongest across MT/northeast
WY/western SD (around 40 kt), weakening with southward extent into
northeast CO (around 20-25 kt). Steep lapse rates and
elongated/straight hodographs suggest isolated large hail will be
possible. Meanwhile, steep low-level lapse rates/mixing to near 700
mb should support isolated strong/severe gusts as well. 

...Lower MI/IN/OH vicinity...

A decaying MCS and associated MCV may be located over WI/IL Tuesday
morning. This feature could develop east/southeast with time and
become a focus for thunderstorm develop during the afternoon or
evening within the very moist and strongly unstable airmass across
the region. However, forecast guidance is not consistent with this
scenario, possibly due to nebulous large-scale ascent. Given
uncertainty/conditional nature of this potential risk, will hold off
on expanding severe probabilities further east, but a risk area may
be needed in later outlooks depending on trends.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0213 PM CDT Sun Jul 27 2025

Valid 281200Z - 291200Z

...19z Update...
A mix of wet/dry storms remains likely across parts of the northern
Great Basin, Cascades and into eastern OR/western ID Monday. While
some wetting rainfall is likely, and could occur over areas that
have seen recent accumulations, dry inverted V structures should
allow for isolated dry strikes to occur within areas of receptive
fuels. CAM guidance has trended more aggressive with storms along
the slops of the Cascades. Have adjusted the IsoDryT area slightly
west to better cover the threat for isolated dry storms.

..Lyons.. 07/27/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0132 AM CDT Sun Jul 27 2025/

...Synopsis...
A similar weather pattern is in store for the U.S. tomorrow
(Monday), with a mid-level trough expected to meander along the West
Coast as upper ridging prevails over the remainder of the CONUS.
Locally dry and breezy conditions are expected across portions of
the Four Corners into the central Rockies, though the lack of a
stronger surface wind field precludes Elevated highlights at this
time. Mid-level moisture ahead of the upper trough will support a
mix of wet and dry thunderstorms Sunday afternoon and evening over
far northern parts of the Great Basin into the Pacific Northwest.
Given dry fuels in place, isolated dry thunderstorm highlights have
been introduced.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1232 PM CDT Sun Jul 27 2025

Valid 281200Z - 291200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM CENTRAL
MONTANA INTO WESTERN WISCONSIN...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are possible from the northern Rockies into the
Dakotas and Upper Midwest Monday afternoon and evening. Large hail
and damaging/severe wind gusts are expected. Isolated intense gusts
to 85 mph may occur from eastern South Dakota into southern
Minnesota.

...Eastern SD into WI...

A favorable pattern for a damaging wind event is evident on Monday
from central/eastern SD into southern MN, far northern IA and
portions of WI. A 10 percent significant wind area has been
delineated and the Slight risk (level 2 of 5) has been expanded
eastward. However, some uncertainties remain (related to Day
1/Sunday convective evolution), precluding a categorical increase to
Enhanced risk (level 3 of 5) at this time.

Enhanced westerly flow is forecast across the northern Plains
vicinity as a series of shortwave perturbations float through the
top of the upper ridge from the northern Rockies into the Upper
Midwest. At 500 mb, 40-60 kt westerly flow will be common. At the
surface, a very moist (mid/upper 70s dewpoints) airmass will be in
place. A plume of steep midlevel lapse rates are also evident if
model forecasts. This combination of a very moist/warm boundary
layer beneath steep lapse rates will support a corridor of strong to
extreme instability (3000-5000+ J/kg MLCAPE) from eastern SD into
southern MN/northern IA and southwest WI.

A surface low is forecast over southern SD/northern NE. A cold front
will develop south/southeast across the Dakotas and Upper Midwest. A
modified outflow boundary from Day 1/Sunday convection also will
likely be in place across parts of MN/IA/WI, though where this
boundary will be is uncertain at this time. The surface low will be
a focus for initial robust thunderstorm development in SD during the
afternoon. With time, upscale growth is likely to occur as a modest
low-level jet develops during the evening. Convection will likely
develop east/southeast along the instability gradient defined by
prior outflow and the southward sagging cold front. Initial
thunderstorms could produce large hail and damaging gusts, with a
transition toward damaging/severe wind swaths if/when upscale growth
occurs. The main uncertainty precluding higher probabilities is
related to how Day 1/Sunday convection will impact the boundary
layer and where related outflow and airmass recovery will occur.
Higher probabilities may be necessary in subsequent outlooks.

...Montana into the western Dakotas...

Isolated to scattered thunderstorms are expected to develop within
the post-frontal upslope regime where boundary layer moisture in the
mid 50s to mid 60s will persist behind the surface boundary. Strong
heating and steep midlevel lapse rates will support 1000-3000 J/kg
MLCAPE values (from west to east) amid elongated/straight
hodographs. Large hail and isolated strong/severe wind gusts will be
possible with this activity.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1200 PM CDT Sun Jul 27 2025

Valid 271630Z - 281200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS
SOUTHERN/EASTERN MINNESOTA AND FAR EASTERN SOUTH DAKOTA...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
MID-ATLANTIC STATES...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are expected this afternoon and evening across
parts of the Upper Midwest to western Great Lakes. Other severe
storms will also be possible in parts of the northern Plains,
central Appalachians, and Mid-Atlantic.

...Upper Midwest/western Great Lakes including MN/eastern SD...
A convectively enhanced mid-level shortwave trough over
northern/eastern North Dakota will continue generally eastward
toward northern Minnesota, with a modest flattening of the
downstream upper-level ridge into tonight. A modest deepening of the
surface low will occur across eastern South Dakota toward the
southwest Minnesota border vicinity, with intense thunderstorm
development later today generally expected to focus along the
southeastward-advancing front, although differential heating and a
convectively aided cluster/possible MCV across northeast South
Dakota at midday may also be factors. 

Given the strong buoyancy near/south of the front, and very steep
lapse rates/elevated mixed layer impinging from the west-southwest,
modestly strong wind profiles will be sufficient for intense
supercell development with initial storms, including large hail
potential (higher magnitudes possible especially eastern South
Dakotas and southwest Minnesota) and some tornado risk. Multiple
southeastward-moving clusters should evolve this evening with an
increasing likelihood of damaging wind across southern Minnesota
into western/northern Wisconsin. Portions of the region have been
upgraded to an Enhanced Risk. 

...Mid-Atlantic/Central Appalachians...
Scattered afternoon thunderstorms will continue to increase
regionally. Similar to previous days, mid-level lapse rates will be
weak and considerable mid-level moisture will keep the overall
potential somewhat limited/isolated. However, the strongest cells
will be capable of occasional gusty/damaging winds, with a somewhat
higher probability of wind damage seemingly existing across eastern
Virginia where buoyancy will be greater.

...Montana...
Strong heating will occur this afternoon across much of
central/eastern Montana, where deep boundary-layer mixing will lead
to inverted-v profiles. Scattered thunderstorms are forecast to
develop along a corridor from southwest into central Montana by late
afternoon. These high-based storms may pose a risk of a few
severe-caliber wind gusts.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0118 AM CDT Sun Jul 27 2025/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will linger along the West Coast as upper ridging
builds over the remainder of the CONUS today. Weak mid-level
perturbations pivoting around the trough will traverse the Great
Basin into the northern Rockies, providing enough upper support for
both dry and breezy conditions across the central Rockies, and
thunderstorm activity over parts of the Northern Great Basin into
the Pacific Northwest.

Across the central Rockies, sustained southwesterly surface winds
may exceed 15 mph for several hours, amid 15 percent RH and dry
fuels, warranting Elevated highlights. Across the northern Great
Basin into the Pacific Northwest, the lifting of mid-level moisture
will encourage high-based thunderstorm development by afternoon.
Forecast soundings depict inverted-v profiles, suggesting that a
combination of wet and dry thunderstorms are possible. With dry
fuels in place, isolated dry thunderstorm highlights have been
introduced.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0638 AM CDT Sun Jul 27 2025

Valid 271300Z - 281200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON AND
EVENING ACROSS PARTS OF THE UPPER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY INTO THE
WESTERN GREAT LAKES REGION...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms will be possible this afternoon and evening
from parts of the upper Mississippi Valley into the western Great
Lakes. Marginally severe storms will also be possible in parts of
the northern Plains, central Appalachians, Mid-Atlantic and eastern
North Carolina.

...Northern MN This Morning...
A persistent bowing MCS is over northern MN headed toward the
Arrowhead region.  These storms have produced locally damaging wind
gusts through much of the night, but have shown signs of weakening
on the north end of the bow during the past 1-2 hours.  One intense
cells remains on the south end of the bow, headed toward the Hibbing
vicinity.  This activity may continue to pose a risk of damaging
winds or hail for awhile this morning.

...Upper MS Valley into western Great Lakes...
A convectively aided shortwave trough is currently tracking across
ND.  This feature will move into northern MN this afternoon with an
associated surface cold front sagging into central MN.  Steep
mid-level lapse rates and strong heating ahead of the front will
result in a very unstable airmass this afternoon, with MLCAPE values
of 3000-4000 J/kg.  A consensus of CAM solutions suggests the
development of a few discrete supercells along the front by mid/late
afternoon.  These storms will be capable of very large hail and
perhaps a few tornadoes during the first couple of hours.  After
that, upscale growth is likely with damaging winds becoming the main
concern as storms build southeastward across southern MN and into
central WI.

...Mid Atlantic/Central Appalachians...
Scattered afternoon thunderstorms are expected once again today from
parts of PA/WV into VA/NC.  Similar to previous days, mid-level
lapse rates will be weak and considerable mid-level moisture will
limit overall severe concerns.  However, the strongest cells will be
capable of occasional gusty/damaging winds.

...MT...
Strong heating will occur this afternoon across much of
central/eastern MT, where deep boundary-layer mixing will lead to
inverted-v profiles.  Scattered thunderstorms are forecast to
develop along a corridor from southwest into central MT by late
afternoon.  These high-based storms may pose a risk of a few
damaging wind gusts.

Tropical Depression One-C Discussion Number   1
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 PM HST Sat Jul 26 2025

Deep convection has persisted over the area of low pressure well 
southeast of the Hawaiian Islands for the last 12 hours or so, with 
the latest satellite images showing improved organization and a 
better defined banding structure.  The latest subjective Dvorak 
current intensity estimates came in at 2.0/30 knots from PHFO, 
1.5/25 knots from SAB, and 1.0/25 knots from JTWC.  A recent 
27/0620Z Metop-B ASCAT pass showed a well-defined low-level 
circulation with a large swath of 25-knot winds and a few embedded 
25- to 30-knot wind barbs.  Given the improved structure and 
organization of the system, advisories are being initiated on the 
first tropical cyclone of the season in the central Pacific, 
Tropical Depression One-C.  The initial intensity will be set at 30 
knots.

Tropical Depression One-C is moving toward the west, or 270 degrees, 
at 10 knots.  This general westward motion is expected to continue 
over the next couple of days as the system moves along the southern 
periphery of a subtropical ridge to the north.  Beyond 48 hours, the 
forward speed is expected to increase considerably in response to a 
low- to mid-level ridge strengthening to the north of cyclone.  The 
track forecast closely follows a blend of the TVCE and HCCA 
consensus guidance.

The environment will remain conducive for intensification over the 
next couple of days, as One-C remains over warm waters between 28 
and 29C, with adequate mid-level moisture and light to moderate 
easterly shear.  As a result, the intensity forecast calls for 
steady strengthening during this time, with One-C becoming Tropical 
Storm Iona on Sunday.  Beyond 60 hours, the cyclone will begin to 
experience increasing westerly vertical wind shear while also 
entraining drier mid-level air.  This is expected to lead to steady 
weakening, with the system becoming a tropical depression again 
around day 5.  The intensity forecast is best aligned with the HCCA 
intensity consensus guidance.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0327 AM CDT Sun Jul 27 2025

Valid 301200Z - 041200Z

...DISCUSSION...
The general upper-level pattern over the next week will feature a
trough in the Northeast, a ridge over much of the southern U.S. and
Plains, and a weak trough off the West Coast. The Northeastern
trough will weaken with time, before moving out of the region around
next weekend.  Models eventually develop a shortwave trough in the
West, but this signal has been inconsistent in the past several
runs. At the surface, high pressure will build into the Great Lakes
and Northeast. This will progressively push a cold front farther
south and west with time.

While some severe risk is possible along the cold front, shear and
buoyancy will be diminished with each successive day. With the front
pushing modest moisture into the Rockies, convection is possible
each day next week. Strong to potentially severe storms may occur
with this activity, but weak shear beneath the upper ridge makes it
unclear where the most intense storms would be. Furthermore,
repeated days of convection will at some point adversely affect the
quality of the low-level airmass. Predictability remains too low for
highlights.

Mesoscale Discussion 1793
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0350 PM CDT Sat Jul 26 2025

Areas affected...much of central into northern South Dakota into
southern North Dakota

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 262050Z - 262315Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Storms will increase over the next 1-2 hours over central
South Dakota, with further activity developing north/northeastward
into southern North Dakota. Damaging winds appear likely, with
locally large hail. Isolated significant gusts cannot be ruled out.

DISCUSSION...Visible imagery shows storms beginning to develop near
the surface low over south-central SD, in a very steep lapse rate
environment. The 18Z UNR soundings shows 9.5 C/km midlevel lapse
rates, and modest westerlies aloft. East of there, surface analysis
depicts MLCAPE in excess of 3000 J/kg, and a theta-e axis roughly
along the ND/SD border counties.

Given the observed TCU vigor over south-central SD currently, this
may be the initiation point for a larger-scale,
northward-propagating complex of storms depicted in some CAM
solutions. Otherwise, it is also possible outflow from high-based
storms coming out of WY into western NE may produce outflow aiding
further development as well.

0348 PM CDT Sat Jul 26 2025

Areas affected...Northeastern Colorado...western Nebraska

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 262048Z - 262145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm activity across the high terrain will move
eastward into the evening with potential for damaging winds.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorm activity has been steadily developing
across the high terrain in Colorado/Wyoming over the last couple of
hours. Dew points in these regions are low in the mid 40s, with
better moisture located across Nebraska into southern South Dakota.
CAM guidance suggests that activity will develop along eastward
moving outflow by late afternoon/evening. Downstream, temperatures
have warmed into the upper 90s to 100s, with dew point spreads
around 40-50 degrees. Though deep layer shear remains weak, large
dew point spreads and steep low to mid-level lapse rates may promote
some damaging wind potential. In addition, the low level jet is
progged to increase through the evening with the deepening of a
surface low across South Dakota. While watch issuance is not
anticipated, trends in this area will be monitored.

Areas affected...eastern Pennsylvania...New Jersey...Long Island

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 542...

Valid 252029Z - 252200Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 542
continues.

SUMMARY...Potential for localized severe gusts remains across the
watch area.

DISCUSSION...Cluster of storms currently extend from coastal MA/RI
across Long Island and into eastern PA, with generally fast movement
to the southeast. A few storms have clearly reached severe levels,
with a 55 kt gust recently measured at Newark Airport. Additional
severe gusts may occur across the remainder of the warm sector over
land from southeast PA into much of NJ and across parts of Long
Island. Little to no additional severe storms are expected behind
the initial activity as due to drying aloft.

Mesoscale Discussion 1778
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0309 PM CDT Fri Jul 25 2025

Areas affected...portions of eastern Kansas and northwestern
Missouri

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 252009Z - 252215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...A few damaging gusts and a few brief tornadoes are
possible this afternoon across parts of eastern Kansas and
northwestern Missouri. A watch may be needed.

DISCUSSION...An MCV is currently situated over north central Kansas,
with an outflow/differential heating boundary across parts of
southeastern Kansas. Due to daytime heating, particularly south of
the boundary, along with surface dewpoints generally in the low to
mid 70s F, inhibition has been removed across the region. There is
some enhanced flow aloft round the MCV, which has provided ~30 kts
of effective bulk shear. Low-level shear is generally fairly weak,
though there is some enhancement in the weak easterly flow north of
the differential heating boundary. Given modest deep-layer shear,
multicell clusters with transient supercells are possible through
the afternoon, and any supercells would carry a risk of a brief
tornado, particularly where low-level shear is locally enhanced.
However, overall weak low-level flow and poor lapse rates may limit
the tornado threat. In addition, the atmosphere is quite moist, and
the water loading in downdrafts may lead to a risk for damaging
gusts as cell cluster with time. Trends are being monitored for a
possible watch.

0308 PM CDT Thu Jul 24 2025

Areas affected...portions of eastern KS into northwest MO

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 242008Z - 242215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated strong wind gusts are possible the remainder of
the afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorms have gradually increased in intensity
this afternoon amid a very moist and moderately unstable airmass.
Vertical shear will remain modest, with effective shear magnitude
only expected to be around 20 kt. Nevertheless, strong instability
and high PW values near 2 inches could support isolated wet
microbursts within this weakly sheared environment. North and east
extent of strong/severe potential may remain somewhat limited due to
early day convection and lingering cloud cover across northern MO.
Weak inhibition remains over this area and instability is somewhat
less. At this time, the overall threat appears limited/transient and
a severe thunderstorm watch is not currently expected.

Areas affected...parts of eastern Wyoming and northern Colorado

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 241941Z - 242145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Storms may produce a few instance of large hail and a few
severe gusts across portions of eastern Wyoming and northern
Colorado. A watch is not anticipated.

DISCUSSION...Convection has developed along the mountains across
parts of eastern Wyoming and northern Colorado, where diurnal
inhibition has eroded. Farther east across the High Plains, some
inhibition remains for mixed-layer parcels, but additional heating
should continue to erode the MLCINH as the afternoon progresses.
Kinematically, the region is on the southern periphery of a modest
mid-level jet. This should provide sufficient shear for at least
transient supercells, and in some places low-level wind profiles
favor left-moving supercells. Given the long hodographs and steep
lapse rates with low freezing levels, some hail is possible with the
strongest storms. Shear decreases with southward extent, so this may
put a limit on the southern extent of the hail risk. With time,
storms may begin to cluster, and these clusters may also produce a
risk for severe gusts given the relatively dry boundary layer and
steep low-level lapse rates. Given the expected sparse coverage of
severe weather, a watch is not anticipated.

Areas affected...portions of northern IL/IN into southern Lower MI

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 241910Z - 242115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated strong to severe wind gusts are possible this
afternoon into early evening across portions of northeast Illinois,
northern Indiana, and southern Lower Michigan.

DISCUSSION...Isolated thunderstorms are developing across northeast
IL as of 19z ahead of surface boundary moving slowly southeastward.
Ahead of the boundary and initial thunderstorm development, strong
heating into the low 90s, with dewpoints in the mid/upper 70s, is
resulting in a corridor of moderate/strong instability (MLCAPE up to
3000 J/kg). Deep shear will remain weak across the region, but
effective shear magnitudes around 20-30 kt may be sufficient for a
few organized cells/clusters. Modified RAP forecast soundings show
large instability, with steep low-level lapse rates from 7-8 C/km in
the 0-3 km layer. Given the very moist and strongly unstable
airmass, isolated downbursts producing strong to severe gusts are
possible through the afternoon into early evening. 

Some uncertainty remains regarding storm coverage, especially given
veering low-level flow, reducing convergence/lift along the surface
boundary. Nevertheless, any storm that does develop could produce
locally damaging gusts. A severe thunderstorm watch may be needed at
some point this afternoon.

0343 PM CDT Wed Jul 23 2025

Areas affected...parts of northeastern Colorado...southeast
Wyoming...and far western Nebraska

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 232043Z - 232245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Storms may produce a few severe gusts and some marginally
severe hail across parts of northeastern Colorado, southeast
Wyoming, and far western Nebraska this afternoon. A watch is not
anticipated.

DISCUSSION...Mid-level clouds from morning convection have been slow
to clear portions of northeastern Colorado, and so heating has been
delayed, which has led to some residual inhibition. Despite this, a
narrow corridor of heating along the mountains has allowed storms to
percolate along the Front Range this afternoon in a post-frontal
upslope flow regime. These storms are well south of the strongest
mid-level flow, and therefore deep-layer shear is relatively weak.
Because of this, multicell clusters are expected to be the dominant
storm mode. In addition, the environment has some mid-level dry air
and steep lapse rates, which may lead to a threat for severe gusts
with the strongest clusters. Some hail is possible with these storms
given low freezing levels, but the lack of deep-layer shear and the
multicell storm mode may limit the severe hail risk with these
storms.

Mesoscale Discussion 1763
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0254 PM CDT Wed Jul 23 2025

Areas affected...portions of southeast MN into north-central WI

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 231954Z - 232200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Intensifying thunderstorms may pose a risk of damaging
wind gusts across southeast Minnesota into portions of
northern/central Wisconsin the next few hours. Area is being
monitored for possible watch issuance.

DISCUSSION...Isolated to scattered thunderstorms are
developing/intensifying this afternoon along/just ahead of the
southward-advancing cold front. This activity is tracking along a
differential heating zone and within the strong instability gradient
oriented across north-central WI. Strong heating ahead of these
storms and dewpoints in the mid 70s have allowed inhibition to
weaken. This area is on the edges of more favorable deep shear, but
20-30 kt effective shear magnitudes may be sufficient for organized
clusters/small bows given strong instability. Modified RAP forecast
soundings and regional VWP data show somewhat small but favorably
curved low-level hodographs. Low-level shear will remain modest, but
given the very moist and unstable boundary layer, a tornado or two
also could occur, in addition to damaging wind gusts. This area is
being monitored for possible watch issuance.

Mesoscale Discussion 1762
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0211 PM CDT Wed Jul 23 2025

Areas affected...parts of eastern Wyoming...southeastern Montana.
western South Dakota...and far northwestern Nebraska

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 231911Z - 232115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Storms with a risk of large hail and severe gusts are
possible this afternoon across portions of eastern Wyoming,
southeastern Montana, western South Dakota, and northwestern
Nebraska. A watch may be needed to cover this threat.

DISCUSSION...Storms are developing in a post-frontal upslope flow
regime in northern and eastern Wyoming. These storms are situated on
the southern periphery of a modest mid-level jet. This flow should
provide sufficient deep-layer shear for a supercell storm mode, and
given the relatively straight hodographs and lower freezing levels,
some severe hail is possible initially with these storms. The
deep-layer shear decreases markedly with southward extent, so this
may put a limit on the southern extent of the hail risk.

Given relatively high boundary layer humidity, cold pools may be
weaker, and therefore upscale growth may be slow to occur. However,
some clustering of storms is expected with time. This would
transition the primary threat to severe gusts given the relatively
steep low-level lapse rates and modest flow aloft on the regional
RAP short-term forecast profiles.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 538
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
135 PM MDT Wed Jul 23 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Western South Dakota
  Central into Northeast Wyoming

* Effective this Wednesday afternoon and evening from 135 PM
  until 800 PM MDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2
    inches in diameter possible
  Isolated damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...Widely scattered to scattered thunderstorms are forecast
to develop this afternoon.  The stronger storms will likely become
supercells and pose a risk for large hail (1 to 2 inches in
diameter).  Isolated severe gusts (60-70 mph) are possible with
supercells and with storms that may congeal into a linear cluster
towards the evening.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 90
statute miles east and west of a line from 50 miles north northeast
of Gillette WY to 30 miles east southeast of Douglas WY. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU8).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 450. Mean storm motion vector
27020.

Mesoscale Discussion 1759
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0728 AM CDT Wed Jul 23 2025

Areas affected...eastern SD and western MN

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 231228Z - 231400Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Sporadic severe gusts may persist this morning with
multiple messy clusters across eastern South Dakota. Watch issuance
in the near-term is uncertain with increasing likelihood towards
midday.

DISCUSSION...A small but persistent cluster that has produced a
focused swath of measured severe gusts across southwest into central
SD has weakened in terms of reflectivity structure and IR cloud top
warming. The downstream front has oscillated southward, suggesting
that this cluster will persist to the cool side of this front and
likely impinge on weak downstream convection towards the SD/ND/MN
border area. Meanwhile, a west/east-oriented convective band
emanating northward across southern SD has produced a couple
measured severe gusts at mesonet sites. This convection will
probably evolve more northeastward into late morning and could also
congeal with the post-frontal convection to the north. Overall messy
and complex convective mode, along with the time of day, suggests
that severe potential may remain sporadic and disorganized. More
positive cold pool merging could occur into western MN towards
midday as greater downstream insolation occurs across
central/southern MN.

755 AM CDT Wed Jul 23 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Far Western Minnesota
  Eastern South Dakota

* Effective this Wednesday morning and afternoon from 755 AM
  until 100 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...

0319 PM CDT Tue Jul 22 2025

Areas affected...portions of southeast North Dakota and northeast
South Dakota

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 222019Z - 222215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Strong to severe thunderstorms are possible into early
evening. Hail and strong gusts may occur with stronger storms.

DISCUSSION...Scattered thunderstorms have developed this afternoon
within the post-outflow airmass. While early day convection and
cloud cover have impacted the airmass to some degree, some recovery
is apparent as temperatures have warmed into the upper 70s to low
80s and dewpoints have been maintained in the upper 60s to low 70s.
As a result, capping is eroding, and MLCAPE has increased to
1000-2000 J/kg. Ongoing storms may be somewhat elevated initially,
but could become surface-based with time. Effective shear magnitudes
greater than 40 kt and steep midlevel lapse rates suggests robust
updrafts supporting isolated large hail and strong/severe gusts will
be possible. Given the influence of outflow and modification of the
airmass from morning convection, convective evolution remains
somewhat uncertain. Portions of the area may eventually need a
severe thunderstorm watch, but timing and location is uncertain.

Mesoscale Discussion 1755
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0300 PM CDT Tue Jul 22 2025

Areas affected...northern WY into southeast MT

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 222000Z - 222200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated strong to severe thunderstorms are possible
across parts of southern Montana and northern Wyoming this afternoon
and evening.

DISCUSSION...Occasionally robust thunderstorms have developed over
higher terrain in portions of southern MT and northern WY. Weak
inhibition remains downstream over the adjacent high Plains, but
additional heating and increasing ascent should allow for storms to
become sustained further from the terrain with time into late
afternoon. Regional VWP data shows elongated, straight hodographs
amid steep midlevel lapse rates. While instability is muted due to
the drier, post-frontal low-level airmass, MLCAPE will still be
sufficient to sustain updrafts. Isolated strong to severe
thunderstorms posing a risk for hail (possibly up to 2 inches,
especially over far southeast MT) will be possible over the next
several hours. Trends will be monitored and a severe thunderstorm
watch may be needed for parts of the discussion area later this
afternoon.

Mesoscale Discussion 1738
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0241 PM CDT Sun Jul 20 2025

Areas affected...south-central South Dakota across western Nebraska
and toward northwest Kansas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 201941Z - 202215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered severe storms appear likely later this afternoon
from south-central SD across west-central NE and toward northwest
KS. A few cells may produce large hail, with locally damaging gusts.
A tornado is possible over southern SD into far northern NE after
23Z. A portion of the area may require a watch.

DISCUSSION...Surface map shows low pressure extending from southwest
SD across western NE and into the CO/KS border area, with strong
heating. This trough will continue to deepen, and sufficient
convergence within the uncapped air mass should allow for widely
scattered storms to develop late this afternoon.

Of particular note is the warm front area which currently curls
northwestward out of northern NE and into south-central SD. Here,
heating is occurring on the cool side of the boundary, where
dewpoints remain above 70 F and low-level shear is enhanced. Any
supercell that develops here, most likely after 23Z, could be
tornadic at times, and produce very large hail as it proceeds
southeastward, aided by a modest evening low-level jet.

Farther south into the deeper/heated air mass, higher based storms
are expected, and overall shear is weaker as well. However, steep
lapse rates will favor locally severe gusts, and even some hail in
the early and robust formation stages.

Mesoscale Discussion 1737
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0135 PM CDT Sun Jul 20 2025

Areas affected...southern Indiana and Ohio...northern Kentucky

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 201835Z - 202130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...A few strong storms producing locally damaging gusts
cannot be ruled out later this afternoon from southern Indiana
across southern Ohio and northeast Kentucky.

DISCUSSION...An MCV continues to move rapidly eastward across
northern IN, well north of a stalled front draped across southern
IL/IN and southwest OH. Meanwhile, a very moist air mass remains
near this boundary, with heating occurring upstream across the Mid
MS and OH Valleys.

While the entire warm sector is unstable, areas near the front exist
beneath slightly stronger deep-layer mean winds, on the southern
periphery of the larger scale trough (and MCV) influence.

Visible imagery show increasing CU fields from southern IN into
northern and eastern KY, and scattered storms are likely within this
zone. Locally strong downbursts will be possible, but any more
substantial wind threat would be conditional on a large cluster of
storms producing outflow, and tracking east/southeast near the
boundary. At this time, it appears a watch will not be necessary.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 530
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
410 PM EDT Sun Jul 20 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Connecticut
  Massachusetts
  Far Southern Maine
  Southern New Hampshire
  Rhode Island
  Southern Vermont
  Coastal Waters

* Effective this Sunday afternoon and evening from 410 PM until
  900 PM EDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 65 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1 inch in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Scattered thunderstorms are forecast to continue to
develop and intensify and pose primarily a threat for strong to
severe gusts (55-65 mph).  Isolated large hail may accompany the
stronger cells.  This activity will likely reach the coast by the
mid evening.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 80
statute miles north and south of a line from 30 miles east northeast
of Boston MA to 25 miles south southwest of Pittsfield MA. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU0).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
1 inch. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 55 knots. A few
cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 400. Mean storm motion vector
28025.

Mesoscale Discussion 1735
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0735 AM CDT Sun Jul 20 2025

Areas affected...Portions of far east-central IL into central IN

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 201235Z - 201430Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...A small complex of thunderstorms may pose a gradually
increasing threat for damaging winds over the next few hours. Watch
issuance is possible later this morning if this activity can
intensify.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorms are ongoing this morning across parts of
central IL, aided by modest west-southwesterly low-level warm
advection and a low-amplitude mid-level perturbation. This
convection should continue to track generally east-southeastward
this morning across parts of central IN along an instability
gradient evident in latest mesoanalysis. While low/mid-level flow is
not overly strong, recent VWPs from KILX/KIND do show some
strengthening with height through mid levels. Resultant 25-30 kt of
effective bulk shear should continue to support some updraft
organization, with a recent supercell structure noted with a
thunderstorm near the IL/IN border. If a small bowing cluster can
become established as some recent high-resolution guidance suggests,
then a greater threat for scattered severe/damaging winds may be
realized across parts of central IN later this morning as the
boundary layer gradually destabilizes with filtered daytime heating.
While not immediately likely, Severe Thunderstorm Watch issuance may
eventually be needed if the ongoing activity can intensify.
