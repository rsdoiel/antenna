Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0650 AM CST Mon Feb 26 2024

Valid 261300Z - 271200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS
OF LOWER MICHIGAN...INDIANA...AND OHIO...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated late-night hail is possible across portions of the central
Great Lakes region.

...Synopsis...
A primarily zonal mid-level flow field in place across much of the
U.S. today will gradually amplify through tonight, as a trough digs
southeastward across the northwestern quarter of the country.  

As this occurs, a cold front oriented east-northeast to
west-southwest is forecast to advance southeastward across the
northern half of the Intermountain West and, later, the northern
Plains through Tuesday morning.  Elsewhere, a rather nondescript
surface pattern will prevail.  

...Parts of Indiana/Ohio/Lower Michigan...
As a lead/subtle mid-level short-wave trough shifts across the
Midwest tonight, some strengthening of a southwesterly low-level jet
is expected across this region.  Resulting quasi-geostrophic ascent
may support development of showers and isolated thunderstorms, atop
a stable lower troposphere where steep mid-level lapse rates may
support upwards of 1000 to 1500 J/kg CAPE through the cloud-bearing
layer.

With moderately strong mid-level west-southwesterly flow
accompanying the short-wave trough, shear sufficient for mid-level
updraft rotation is evident.  With that said, model guidance -- both
parameterized and convection-allowing -- in general indicates
minimal overall convective development, in part due to questions
regarding potential for ample moist advection/saturation above the
inversion so as to support deep convective development.  Still,
presuming a few deeper convective cells can become
organized/sustained tonight, severe-caliber hail would be possible.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0204 AM CST Mon Feb 26 2024

Valid 271200Z - 281200Z

...Synopsis...
Across the western US, an amplifying Pacific trough will begin to
phase with intensifying southern stream flow as it crosses the
southern and central Rockies into the Plains. A strong lee low will
move over the central Plains with dry and breezy conditions likely
behind a trailing dryline/surface pressure trough. Favorable
meteorological conditions and at least somewhat receptive fuels
should support widespread elevated to near-critical fire-weather
concerns over parts of the southern Plains.

...southern Plains...
As the aforementioned trough begins to move over the Plains early
D2/Tuesday, strong low-level flow is expected to develop by mid
morning. Westerly winds of 20-25 mph, with gusts of 30-35 mph, are
possible across parts of western and central OK and the TX
Panhandle. Despite dry downsloping and the unusually warm
temperatures, increasing mid and high-level cloud cover may limit
diurnal RH minimums to near 20-25%. Pre-greenup fuels have shown
some drying over the previous days, but remain only partially
receptive to broader fire spread despite the favorable
meteorological conditions. Still, widespread elevated to
near/briefly critical fire-weather conditions appear likely. The
greatest confidence in potentially longer-lived critical conditions
is across parts of western and central OK and the eastern TX
Panhandle where the strongest winds are expected to overlap more
receptive fuels for the greatest duration.

Fire-weather concerns will begin to diminish later in the evening as
a cold front rapidly moves south. Strong gusts may persist behind
the front along with a rapid wind shift to north/northwesterly.
Cooler temperatures and higher RH behind the front should quickly
limit sustained fire-weather concerns through the overnight hours.

...Midwest...
Farther to the northeast, gusty southwest winds and very warm/dry
conditions are expected southwest of the advancing low across parts
of MO and western IL. A pronounced low-level thermal ridge
overlaying southwest winds of 20-30 mph may support brief elevated
or locally critical fire-weather conditions Tuesday afternoon. Area
fuels have shown increased dryness over the past several days, but
remain partially receptive to fire spread. Thus, confidence in
sustained fire-weather conditions is low.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0612 PM CST Sat Feb 24 2024

Valid 250100Z - 251200Z

...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms are not forecast the rest of tonight.

...01z Update...

Northwesterly flow is deepening across the Carolinas this evening as
the primary corridor of low-level convergence focuses offshore in
response to the progressive short-wave trough. While a few showers
will linger across Coastal Carolinas this evening, the prospect for
lightning is lessening with this activity given the weakening
low-level lapse rates/buoyancy (nocturnal cooling) and downstream
convergence.
