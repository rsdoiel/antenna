0716 AM CDT Mon Mar 17 2025

Valid 171300Z - 181200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not forecast across the contiguous United
States.

...Synopsis...
The upper-air pattern today will feature a large-scale trough
exiting the East Coast as a ridge builds over the central U.S.,
followed by a trough moving into Interior West from the eastern
Pacific.  A few weak thunderstorms may develop beneath a cold
mid-level trough along the Carolina coast later this afternoon. 
Otherwise, dry offshore flow over the East Coast and Gulf Coast will
lead to tranquil conditions.  A few widely spaced, weak
thunderstorms are possible over parts of the West.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook

0357 AM CDT Mon Mar 17 2025

Valid 201200Z - 251200Z

...DISCUSSION...
...Thursday/Day 4 to Saturday/Day 6...
On Thursday, a trough at mid-levels will move eastward into the
Appalachians, as a cold front advances quickly eastward across the
Atlantic Coastal states. Isolated strong gusts may occur with
convection that develops along or ahead of the front. The threat is
expected to be marginal.

On Saturday and Sunday, a mid-level trough is forecast to quickly
move from the High Plains to the East Coast. A moist airmmass in the
Gulf Coast region is forecast to remain largely in place as the
system passes to the north. This will likely limit any severe
potential.

...Sunday/Day 7 and Monday/Day 8...
From Saturday night into Sunday, moisture advection is forecast to
increase considerably over the southern Plains, as a mid-level
trough moves quickly southeastward across the central U.S.
Medium-range models suggest that the northern edge of the moist
airmass will be located from the Red River Valley eastward into the
lower Mississippi Valley by Sunday afternoon. Thunderstorm
development will be possible along this east-to-west corridor during
the late afternoon and evening, where the models suggest that
moderate instability and strong deep-layer shear will be in place.
Model spread appears low enough to add a 15 percent area, centered
on the Ark-La-Tex for Sunday.

On Monday, the trough is forecast to move eastward across the Ohio
and Tennessee Valleys, as a cold front advances quickly toward the
Atlantic Seaboard. Thunderstorms with an isolated severe threat will
be possible along and near the front during the afternoon, but
predictability is low concerning the timing of the front, and its
associated trough.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0237 AM CDT Mon Mar 17 2025

Valid 181200Z - 191200Z

...EXTREMELY CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR FAR SOUTHEAST NEW MEXICO
INTO NORTHWEST TEXAS AND THE TEXAS PANHANDLE...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR THE SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

...Synopsis...
Extremely critical fire weather conditions are expected Tuesday
afternoon across parts of the southern High Plains with widespread
critical/elevated conditions extending well into the central Plains.

Early-morning water-vapor imagery depicts an amplified upper trough
off the West Coast. This feature is expected to migrate east over
the next 48 hours, ejecting into the southern/central Plains by late
Tuesday. As this occurs, robust lee cyclogenesis is anticipated
across eastern CO and western KS with minimum surface pressure
values falling into the 988 to 992 mb range, which would be well
below the 10th percentile of surface pressure climatology for
mid-March in the Plains. Such a strong surface low will induce a
wide fetch of 20-25 mph winds ahead of and behind an eastward
advancing dryline across TX/OK. Moisture return ahead of the low
across central TX/OK will limit RH reductions to some degree by late
afternoon, but single digit RH minimums are forecast behind the
dryline across much of eastern NM and western KS. 

The arrival of a jet streak associated with a low to mid-level cold
front across the southern Rockies along with terrain enhancements
off the Caprock and Davis Mountains will support a swath of
sustained 30 mph winds (potentially gusting to 40-50 mph) from the
Trans Pecos region northeastward to the I-40 corridor in the TX
Panhandle. Some forecast uncertainty remains regarding the timing of
the low-level front/jet streak, but ensemble probabilities between
50-70% for 30 mph winds coupled with single-digit RH values and
critically dry fuels lend enough confidence to introduce an
Extremely Critical fire weather risk area. 

Elsewhere, widespread 20-30 mph winds are expected to the west of
the surface flow within the downslope flow regime. Extremely
critical conditions may develop across northeast NM into far
southeast CO and adjacent portions of KS and OK based on
drier/windier solutions, but weaker ensemble support limits
confidence in this potential. Across central OK, critical conditions
may spread as far east as the I-35 corridor depending on how far
east the dryline mixes by peak heating. Similarly, the quality of
moisture return into eastern OK and KS will determine the magnitude
of the fire weather threat given the expectation for sustained 15-25
mph southerly winds. Forecast adjustments are expected over the next
24 hours as these details come into better focus in short-range
guidance.

Mesoscale Discussion 0222
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0628 AM CDT Sun Mar 16 2025

Areas affected...North Florida and southeast Georgia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 161128Z - 161300Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...A broken band of storms will spread eastward into
southeast Georgia and north Florida through late morning.  A new
tornado watch appears likely.

DISCUSSION...A broken band of storms has persisted overnight from
south central GA into the eastern FL Panhandle, with
occasional/embedded supercell structures.  Low-level moistening over
the next few hours and the onset of diurnal heating will drive
destabilization across north FL/southeast GA later this morning. 
Though the low-level jet core will develop northeastward toward the
Carolinas through the day, low-level flow/shear will remain
sufficiently strong to support additional supercells through the
morning across north FL/southeast GA.  The storms will remain
capable of producing occasional damaging winds and possibly a couple
of tornadoes, and a new tornado watch will likely be needed from
12-13z.

  Coastal Waters

* Effective this Sunday morning and afternoon from 610 AM until
  200 PM EDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A couple tornadoes possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 0.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...A broken band of thunderstorms will continue east into the
Watch area this morning within a weakly unstable airmass with very
strong flow aloft.  A greater risk for wind damage along with a
threat for a couple of tornadoes, will seemingly focus with
organized bowing segments and perhaps a few embedded circulations
within the band of thunderstorms.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 80 statute miles
east and west of a line from 35 miles north northeast of
Fayetteville NC to 45 miles southwest of Savannah GA. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU1).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 50...

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 0.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 60 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 450. Mean
storm motion vector 25040.
