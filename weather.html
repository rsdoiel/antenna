Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0644 AM CST Wed Dec 25 2024

Valid 251300Z - 261200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected today (Christmas).

...Synopsis...
Water-vapor imagery this morning shows a mid-level disturbance over
the northwest Gulf Coast while another upstream and more potent
shortwave trough is located over UT/AZ.  The Gulf Coast disturbance
will weaken during the day as it moves east across the central Gulf
Coast.  Limited low-level mass response is forecast across southern
LA due in part to relatively cool/stable conditions via a
slow-to-erode surface ridge initially located over the central Gulf
Coast.  The maritime boundary over the northern Gulf is only
expected to reach the near-shore waters.  The airmass north of the
maritime front was sampled by the 12 UTC Lake Charles observed
sounding (near zero surface-based CAPE), and this expected lack of
appreciable airmass modification/destabilization during the day will
limit storm intensity.  The ongoing convective band over southwest
LA this morning will likely continue east through midday and reach
south-central LA, with a few elevated thunderstorms moving inland
from the Gulf.  Later this afternoon, a few strong storms may
approach the southeastern-most portions of LA, but the primary
concern should remain offshore.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0402 AM CST Wed Dec 25 2024

Valid 281200Z - 021200Z

...DISCUSSION...
At least some severe-weather potential is expected this weekend
including Saturday/Day 4 and possibly Sunday/Day 5. On Saturday/Day
4, the next in a series of shortwave troughs is expected to shift
eastward over the southern Plains and Ozarks. Given the influence of
the upper-level system and proximity of low-level moisture, at least
some severe risk appears likely across the Lower Mississippi Valley
to Tennessee Valley, including parts of Louisiana to Mississippi and
Alabama. However, the short periodicity in the wake of the prior
shortwave trough, plus the possibility of extensive early day
precipitation, currently limits confidence in placement of a 15+
percent severe risk area, although Slight Risk-caliber potential may
become more evident in future outlooks. 

The severe-storm risk should shift eastward across the Southeast
States on Sunday/Day 5, but probably on a more isolated/marginal
basis. Severe storm potential should be relatively low early next
week into Days 6-8 Monday-Wednesday.
