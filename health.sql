To overcome this problem, novel strategies are being explored to enhance the effectiveness of antibiotics. Antibiotic adjuvants have emerged as a promising approach to combat MDR pathogens by acting synergistically with antibiotics. This review focuses on the role of antibiotic adjuvants as a synergistic tool in the fight against MDR pathogens. Adjuvants refer to compounds or agents that enhance the activity of antibiotics, either by potentiating their effects or by targeting the mechanisms of antibiotic resistance. The utilization of antibiotic adjuvants offers several advantages. Firstly, they can restore the effectiveness of existing antibiotics against resistant strains. Adjuvants can inhibit the mechanisms that confer resistance, making the pathogens susceptible to the action of antibiotics. Secondly, adjuvants can enhance the activity of antibiotics by improving their penetration into bacterial cells, increasing their stability, or inhibiting efflux pumps that expel antibiotics from bacterial cells. Various types of antibiotic adjuvants have been investigated, including efflux pump inhibitors, resistance-modifying agents, and compounds that disrupt bacterial biofilms. These adjuvants can act synergistically with antibiotics, resulting in increased antibacterial activity and overcoming resistance mechanisms. In conclusion, antibiotic adjuvants have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of MDR pathogens. By enhancing the efficacy of antibiotics, adjuvants offer a promising strategy to combat the growing threat of antibiotic resistance. Further research and development in this field are crucial to harness the full potential of antibiotic adjuvants and bring them closer to clinical application.</p>',NULL,'','2023-12-20 00:00:00','Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology','',NULL,'2023-12-21 03:23:58','read');

Strategies for managing these pests have relied on a range of approaches, including crop rotation, the utilization of genetic resistance, cultural techniques, and since the 1950’s the use of nematicides. Although nematicides have been hugely successful in controlling nematodes, their toxicity to humans, domestic animals, beneficial organisms, and the environment has raised concerns regarding their use. Alternatives are therefore being sought. The <italic>Pasteuria</italic> group of bacteria that form endospores has generated much interest among companies wanting to develop microbial biocontrol products. A major challenge in developing these bacteria as biocontrol agents is their host-specificity; one population of the bacterium can attach to and infect one population of plant-parasitic nematode but not another of the same species. Here we will review the mechanism by which infection is initiated with the adhesion of endospores to the nematode cuticle. To understand the genetics of the molecular processes between <italic>Pasteuria</italic> endospores and the nematode cuticle, the review focuses on the nature of the bacterial adhesins and how they interact with the nematode cuticle receptors by exploiting new insights gained from studies of bacterial infections of <italic>Carnorhabditis elegans</italic>. A new <italic>Velcro-</italic>like multiple adhesin model is proposed in which the cuticle surface coat, which has an important role in endospore adhesion, is a complex extracellular matrix containing glycans originating in seam cells.

However, its surface exhibits a propensity for bacterial colonization, and the material can fracture under masticatory pressure. This study incorporated commercially available RHA-1F-II nano-silver loaded zirconium phosphate (Ag-ZrP) into room-temperature cured PMMA at varying mass fractions. Various methods were employed to characterize Ag-ZrP. Subsequently, an examination of the effects of Ag-ZrP on the antimicrobial properties, biosafety, and mechanical properties of PMMA materials was conducted. The results indicated that the antibacterial rate against Streptococcus mutans was enhanced at Ag-ZrP additions of 0%wt, 0.5%wt, 1.0%wt, 1.5%wt, 2.0%wt, 2.5%wt, and 3.0%wt, achieving respective rates of 53.53%, 67.08%, 83.23%, 93.38%, 95.85%, and 98.00%. Similarly, the antibacterial rate against Escherichia coli registered at 31.62%, 50.14%, 64.00%, 75.09%, 86.30%, 92.98%. When Ag-ZrP was introduced at amounts ranging from 1.0% to 1.5%, PMMA materials exhibited peak mechanical properties. However, mechanical strength diminished beyond additions of 2.5%wt to 3.0%wt, relative to the 0%wt group, while PMMA demonstrated no notable cytotoxicity below a 3.0%wt dosage. Thus, it is inferred that optimal antimicrobial and mechanical properties of PMMA materials are achieved with nano-Ag-ZrP (RHA-1F-II) additions of 1.5%wt to 2.0%wt, without eliciting cytotoxicity.</p>',NULL,'','2023-12-20 00:00:00','Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology','',NULL,'2023-12-21 03:23:58','read');

Identification of characteristics of <italic>Lm</italic> transmission through trading of food products is essential for rapidly tracking <italic>Lm</italic> sources and controlling dissemination of listeriosis. In this study, a total of 44 <italic>Lm</italic> strains were isolated from food products originating from 14 countries/regions during 2003-2018 at the Shanghai port. The genomes of these Lm strains were sequenced by high-throughput sequencing. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis showed that 43 isolates were divided into 17 sequence types (STs). The distribution of STs was decentralized, with the dominant ST2 accounting for only 18.18% of the strains. The LM63 strain did not match with any of the existing STs. Core-genome MLST (cgMLST) analysis based on 1748 core genes categorized the 44 strains into 30 cgMLST types (CTs), with CT10153 and CT7892 as the most predominant CTs. Notably, LM63 and LM67 shared the same CT in the cgMLST analysis. The phylogenetic analysis based on single-copy homologous genes revealed that the 44 <italic>Lm</italic> strains were primarily classified into two lineages. The SNP analysis also indicated that these strains were roughly divided into two clades, with strains in the first clade mainly collected earlier than those in the second clade, which were predominantly collected from 2010 onwards. The analysis using the virulence factor database (VFDB) indicated that the virulence gene <italic>inlJ</italic> was the most prevalent among these 44 strains. Notably, <italic>ddrA</italic>, <italic>msbA</italic>, and <italic>sugC</italic> were enriched in this dataset, requiring further clarification of their roles in <italic>Listeria</italic> through future studies.

Mechanisms of biofilm-induced antimicrobial resistance involve reduced penetration of antimicrobial agents, increased expression of efflux pumps, altered microbial physiology, and genetic changes in the bacterial population. Factors contributing to the formation of biofilms include nutrient availability, temperature, pH, surface properties, and microbial interactions. Biofilm-associated infections can have serious consequences for patient outcomes, and standard antimicrobial therapies are often ineffective against biofilm-associated bacteria, making diagnosis and treatment challenging. Novel strategies, including antibiotics combination therapies (such as daptomycin and vancomycin, colistin and azithromycin), biofilm-targeted agents (such as small molecules (LP3134, LP3145, LP4010, LP1062) target c-di-GMP), and immunomodulatory therapies (such as the anti-PcrV IgY antibodies which target Type IIIsecretion system), are being developed to combat biofilm-induced antimicrobial resistance.

How RVFV spreads through a population depends on population-level and individual-level interactions between vector, host and pathogen. Here, we estimated the probability for RVFV to transmit to naive animals by experimentally exposing lambs to a bite of an infectious mosquito, and assessed if and how RVFV infection subsequently developed in the exposed animal. <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes, previously infected via feeding on a viremic lamb, were used to expose naive lambs to the virus. <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> colony mosquitoes were used as they are easy to maintain and readily feed in captivity. Other mosquito spp. could be examined with similar methodology. Lambs were exposed to either 1-3 (low exposure) or 7-9 (high exposure) infectious mosquitoes. All lambs in the high exposure group became viremic and showed characteristic signs of Rift Valley fever within 2-4 days post exposure. In contrast, 3 out of 12 lambs in the low exposure group developed viremia and disease, with similar peak-levels of viremia as the high exposure group but with some heterogeneity in the onset of viremia. These results suggest that the likelihood for successful infection of a ruminant host is affected by the number of infectious mosquitoes biting, but also highlights that a single bite of an infectious mosquito can result in disease. The per bite mosquito-to-host transmission efficiency was estimated at 28% (95% confidence interval: 15 - 47%). We subsequently combined this transmission efficiency with estimates for life traits of <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> or related mosquitoes into a Ross-McDonald mathematical model to illustrate scenarios under which major RVFV outbreaks could occur in naïve populations (i.e., R<sub>0</sub> &gt;1). The model revealed that relatively high vector-to-host ratios as well as mosquitoes feeding preferably on competent hosts are required for R<sub>0</sub> to exceed 1. Altogether, this study highlights the importance of experiments that mimic natural exposure to RVFV. The experiments facilitate a better understanding of the natural progression of disease and a direct way to obtain epidemiological parameters for mathematical models.</p>',NULL,'','2023-12-18 00:00:00','Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology','',NULL,'2023-12-21 03:23:59','read');

The term “vector competence” describes the intrinsic ability of an arthropod vector to transmit an infectious agent. Prior to transmission, the mosquito itself presents a complex and hostile environment through which a virus must transit to ensure propagation and transmission to the next host. Viruses imbibed in an infectious blood meal must pass in and out of the mosquito midgut, traffic through the body cavity or hemocoel, invade the salivary glands, and be expelled with the saliva when the vector takes a subsequent blood meal. Viruses encounter physical, cellular, microbial, and immunological barriers, which are influenced by the genetic background of the mosquito vector as well as environmental conditions. Collectively, these factors place significant selective pressure on the virus that impact its evolution and transmission. Here, we provide an overview of the current state of the field in understanding the mosquito-specific factors that underpin vector competence and how each of these mechanisms may influence virus evolution.</p>',NULL,'','2023-12-21 00:00:00','Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology','',NULL,'2023-12-21 18:22:25','read');

The herpesvirus detected in patients, especially with severe and immunodeficient diseases, is gradually attracting the attention of clinical doctors. However, little is known about the effect of herpesvirus on the prognosis of SP patients and the pulmonary microbial community. Here, we retrospectively analyzed respiratory samples from 45 SP patients detected by metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS). A total of five types of herpesviruses were detected, with <italic>Human alphaherpesvirus 1</italic> (HHV-1) in 19 patients, <italic>Human betaherpesvirus 5</italic> (CMV) in 7 patients, <italic>Human betaherpesvirus 7</italic> (HHV-7) in 6 patients, <italic>Human alphaherpesvirus 2</italic> (HHV-2) in 5 patients, and <italic>Human gammaherpesvirus 4</italic> (EBV) in 4 patients. Further analysis showed that the mortality of the herpesvirus-positive group was significantly higher than that of the negative group. The results also showed that HHV-1 was significantly associated with the prognosis of SP patients, while the other herpesviruses did not have a significant difference in patient mortality. A comparison of the microbial community characteristics of SP patients showed a significant difference in beta-diversity between herpesvirus-positive and negative groups. Species difference analysis showed that the herpesvirus-positive group was related to more conditional pathogens, such as <italic>Pneumocystis jirovecii</italic> and <italic>Burkholderia cepacia</italic>. In summary, our results suggest that the presence of herpesvirus is associated with the mortality of SP patients.

INSERT INTO items VALUES('https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2023.1234903','Decoding the multifaceted interventions between human sirtuin 2 and dynamic hepatitis B viral proteins to confirm their roles in HBV replication','<p>The human sirtuin 2 gene (<italic>SIRT2</italic>) encodes a full-length Sirt2 protein (i.e., the Sirt2 isoform 1), which primarily functions as a cytoplasmic α-tubulin deacetylase, and which promotes the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication itself, or HBV X (HBx) protein-mediated transcriptional transactivation, enhances Sirt2.1 expression; therefore, Sirt2.1 itself is capable of positively increasing HBV transcription and replication. Sirt2.1 is linked to liver fibrosis and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and, consequently, augments the risk of HCC. The Sirt2.1 protein enhances the HBV replication cycle by activating the AKT/glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β)/β-catenin pathway. It also activates the transcription of the viral enhancer I/HBx promoter (EnI/Xp) and enhancer II/HBc promoter (EnII/Cp) by targeting the transcription factor p53. The Sirt2 isoform 2 (Sirt2.2) is mainly localized in the cytoplasm, and the N-terminus is shorter by 37 amino acids than that of Sirt2.1. Despite the truncation of the N-terminal region, Sirt2.2 is still capable of enhancing HBV replication and activating the AKT/GSK3β/β-catenin signaling pathway. The Sirt2 isoform 5 (Sirt2.5) is primarily localized to the nucleus, it lacks a nuclear export signal (NES), and the catalytic domain (CD) is truncated. Upon HBV replication, expression of the Sirt2 isoforms is also enhanced, which further upregulates the HBV replication, and, therefore, supports the vicious cycle of viral replication and progression of the disease. Sirt2 diversely affects HBV replication such that its isoform 1 intensely augments HBV replication and isoform 2 (despite of the truncated N-terminal region) moderately enhances HBV replication. Isoform 5, on the other hand, tends to protect the cell (for smooth long-term continued viral replication) from HBV-induced extreme damage or death via a discrete set of regulatory mechanisms impeding viral mRNAs, the hepatitis B core/capsid protein (HBc), core particles, replicative intermediate (RI) DNAs, and covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) levels, and, consequently, limiting HBV replication. In contrast to Sirt2.1 and Sirt 2.2, the Sirt2.5-mediated HBV replication is independent of the AKT/GSK3β/β-catenin signaling cascade. Sirt2.5 is recruited more at cccDNA than the recruitment of Sirt2.1 onto the cccDNA. This recruitment causes the deposition of more histone lysine methyltransferases (HKMTs), including SETDB1, SUV39H1, EZH2, and PR-Set7, along with the respective corresponding transcriptional repressive markers such as H3K9me3, H3K27me3, and H4K20me1 onto the HBV cccDNA. In HBV-replicating cells, Sirt2.5 can also make complexes with PR-Set7 and SETDB1. In addition, Sirt2.5 has the ability to turn off transcription from cccDNA through epigenetic modification via either direct or indirect interaction with HKMTs.</p>',NULL,'','2024-01-04 00:00:00','Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology','',NULL,'2024-01-05 02:41:02','read');

We have established a nonhuman primate model of Group B <italic>Streptococcus</italic> (GBS, <italic>Streptococcus agalactiae</italic>) infection-associated preterm birth. Immune checkpoints are modulators of the immune response by activating or suppressing leukocyte function and are understudied in preterm birth. The objective of this study was to spatially profile changes in immune protein expression at the maternal-fetal interface during a GBS infection with a focus on immune checkpoints.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Twelve nonhuman primates (pigtail macaques, <italic>Macaca nemestrina</italic>) received a choriodecidual inoculation of either: 1) 1-5 X 10<sup>8</sup> colony forming units (CFU) of hyperhemolytic/hypervirulent GBS (GBSΔ<italic>covR</italic>, N=4); 2) an isogenic/nonpigmented strain (GBS Δ<italic>covR</italic>Δ<italic>cylE</italic>, N=4); or, 3) saline (N=4).

In response to viral infection, the host’s innate immune system triggers an antiviral immune response mostly mediated by inflammatory processes. Among the many pathways involved, the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome has received wide attention in the context of viral infection. The NLRP3 inflammasome is an intracellular sensor composed of three components, including the innate immune receptor NLRP3, adaptor apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing CARD (ASC), and the cysteine protease caspase-1. After being assembled, the NLRP3 inflammasome can trigger caspase-1 to induce gasdermin D (GSDMD)-dependent pyroptosis, promoting the maturation and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18). Recent studies have revealed that a variety of viruses activate or inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome via viral particles, proteins, and nucleic acids. In this review, we present a variety of regulatory mechanisms and functions of the NLRP3 inflammasome upon RNA viral infection and demonstrate multiple therapeutic strategies that target the NLRP3 inflammasome for anti-inflammatory effects in viral infection.</p>',NULL,'','2024-01-05 00:00:00','Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology','',NULL,'2024-01-05 17:58:23','read');

For example, in many cases, it has been found that secondary or mixed infection of animals caused by ORFV (an epitheliophilic Parapoxvirus) and bacteria (such as Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus) shows a mutual aid mode that indirectly leads to the deterioration of the disease. However, the lack of research on the co-pathogenic mechanism, including how to hijack and destroy the cell host in the pathological microenvironment, has hindered the in-depth understanding of the pathogenic process and consequences of this complex infection and the development of clinical treatment methods. Here, we summarized the current strategies of trapping cell hosts together, based on the previously defined ORFV-Host (O-H) system. The opportunistic invasion of <italic>S. aureus</italic> destroyed the delicate dynamic balance of the O-H, thus aggravating tissue damage through bacterial products (mediated by Agr), even causing sepsis or inducing cytokine storms. In fact, the virus products from its adaptive regulatory system (VARS) weaken the immune attacks and block molecular pathways, so that <italic>S. aureus</italic> can settle there more smoothly, and the toxins can penetrate into local tissues more quickly. This paper focuses on the main challenges faced by cell hosts in dealing with mixed infection, which provides a starting point for us to deal with this disease in the future.</p>',NULL,'','2024-01-08 00:00:00','Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology','',NULL,'2024-01-08 16:07:17','read');

The chronic impacts of light-emitting diode (LED) lighting at night on gut microbiota and serum lipids were investigated. Male C57BL/6 mice were exposed to blue or white LED lighting at Zeitgeber time 13.5-14 (ZT; ZT0 is the onset of “lights on” and ZT12 is the “lights off” onset under 12-hour light, 12-hour dark schedule). After 33 weeks, only the high irradiance (7.2 J/cm<sup>2</sup>) of blue LED light reduced the alpha diversity of gut microbiota. The high irradiance of white LED light and the low irradiance (3.6 J/cm<sup>2</sup>) of both lights did not change microbial alpha diversity. However, the low irradiance, but not the high one, of both blue and white LED illuminations significantly increased serum total cholesterol (TCHO), but not triglyceride (TG). There was no significant difference of microbial abundance between two lights. The ratio of beneficial to harmful bacteria decreased at a low irradiance but increased at a high irradiance of blue light. Notably, this ratio was negatively correlated with serum TCHO but positively correlated with bile acid biosynthesis pathway. Therefore, chronic blue LED lighting at a high irradiance may harvest gut dysbiosis in association with decreased alpha diversity and the ratio of beneficial to harmful bacteria to specifically dysregulates TCHO metabolism in mice. Night shift workers are recommended to be avoid of blue LED lighting for a long and lasting time.</p>',NULL,'','2024-01-08 00:00:00','Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology','',NULL,'2024-01-08 16:07:17','read');

The current understanding is that the host response to sepsis is highly diverse among patients, and this heterogeneity impacts immune function and response to infection. Phenotyping immune function and classifying sepsis patients into specific endotypes is needed to develop a personalized treatment approach. Neutrophil-endothelium interactions play a critical role in sepsis progression, and increased neutrophil influx and endothelial barrier disruption have important roles in the early course of organ damage.

This defense pathway is widely studied in the context of infections with mycobacteria, the causative agents of human tuberculosis and tuberculosis-like disease in animal models. Our previous work in a zebrafish tuberculosis model showed that host defense against <italic>Mycobacterium marinum</italic> (Mm) is impaired by deficiencies in xenophagy receptors, optineurin (Optn) or sequestome 1 (p62), and Damage-regulated autophagy modulator 1 (Dram1). However, the interdependency of these receptors and their interaction with Dram1 remained unknown. In the present study, we used single and double knockout zebrafish lines in combination with overexpression experiments. We show that Optn and p62 can compensate for the loss of each other’s function, as their overexpression restores the infection susceptibility of the mutant phenotypes. Similarly, Dram1 can compensate for deficiencies in Optn and p62, and, vice versa, Optn and p62 compensate for the loss of Dram1, indicating that these xenophagy receptors and Dram1 do not rely on each other for host defense against Mm.

During the last decades it has become a major threat for healthcare settings due to the high antibiotic resistance rates among these isolates. Many resistance determinants are coded by conjugative or mobilizable plasmids, facilitating their dissemination. The majority of plasmids harbored by <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> species are less than 20 Kb, however, high molecular weight elements are the most clinically relevant since they usually contain antibiotic resistance genes. The aim of this work was to describe, classify and determine the genetic content of plasmids harbored by carbapem resistant <italic>A. baumannii</italic> isolates belonging to predominant clonal lineages circulating in hospitals from Alexandria, Egypt. The isolates were subjected to S1-Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis experiments to identify high molecular weight plasmids. To further analyze the plasmid content and the genetic localization of the antibiotic resistance genes, isolates were sequenced by Illumina Miseq and MinION Mk1C and a hybrid assembly was performed using Unicycler v0.5.0. Plasmids were detected with MOBsuite 3.0.3 and Copla.py v.1.0 and mapped using the online software Proksee.ca. Replicase genes were further analyzed through a BLAST against the <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> Plasmid Typing database. Eleven plasmids ranging in size from 4.9 to 205.6 Kb were characterized and mapped. All isolates contained plasmids, and, in many cases, more than two elements were identified. Antimicrobial resistance genes such as <italic>bla</italic><sub>OXA-23</sub>, <italic>bla</italic><sub>GES-like</sub>, <italic>aph(3’)-VI</italic> and <italic>qacEΔ1</italic> were found in likely conjugative large plasmids; while virulence determinants such as septicolysin or TonB-dependent receptors were identified in plasmids of small size. Some of these resistance determinants were, in turn, located within transposons and class 1 integrons. Among the identified plasmids, the majority encoded proteins belonging to the Rep_3 family, but replicases of the RepPriCT_1 (Aci6) family were also identified. Plasmids are of high interest as antibiotic resistance control tools, since they may be used as genetic markers for antibiotic resistance and virulence, and also as targets for the development of compounds that can inhibit transfer processes.</p>',NULL,'','2024-01-09 00:00:00','Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology','',NULL,'2024-01-09 16:25:53','read');

The role of these changes and their precise association with disease course and activity remain ambiguous. In this prospective single-center study, the mucosal microbiome of surgical CD and non-CD patients was compared at the time of surgery. Microbial analyses were individually performed for ileal and colonic tissue samples obtained during surgery using 16S-rRNA-gene amplicon sequencing. Three groups out of the 46 included patients were formed: 1) a study group of CD of patients who received ileocecal resection due to CD involvement (CD study, n=10); 2) a control group of non-CD of patients who received intestinal resection due to indications other than CD (non-CD control, n=27); and 3) a second control group of CD who underwent resection of the intestine not affected by CD (CD non-affected control, n=9). Species richness and Shannon diversity were not different between all formed groups and regions analyzed (p&gt;0.05). Several significant taxonomic differences were seen at the phylum-, order-, and genus-levels between the formed groups, such as a decrease of <italic>Firmicutes</italic> (phylum-level) and an increase of <italic>Bacteroides</italic> and <italic>Escherichia/Shigella/Pseudescherichia</italic> (genus-level) in CD study – colon vs. the non-CD control – colon (p ≤ 0.05).

Glucose uptake blocking strategy is suggested as a novel mode of action that leads to selective starvation in various species of malaria parasites. The role of hexose transporter 1 in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species is glucose uptake, and its blocking strategies proved to successfully induce selective starvation. However, there is limited information on the glucose uptake properties via <italic>P. vivax</italic> hexose transporter 1 (PvHT1).

The PvHT1 North Korean strain (PvHT1<sub>NK</sub>) expressed <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes mediating the transport of [<sup>3</sup>H] deoxy-D-glucose (ddGlu) in an expression and incubation time-dependent manner without sodium dependency. Moreover, the PvHT1<sub>NK</sub> showed no exchange mode of glucose in efflux experiments and concentration-dependent results showed saturable kinetics following the Michaelis-Menten equation. Non-linear regression analysis revealed a Km value of 294.1 μM and a Vmax value of 1,060 pmol/oocyte/hr, and inhibition experiments showed a strong inhibitory effect by glucose, mannose, and ddGlu. Additionally, weak inhibition was observed with fructose and galactose.

CSD commonly develops as a result of cat scratches and bites or when injured skin comes into contact with cat saliva. The manifestation of CSD clinically differs for each patient based on their immune system. Individuals who have healthy immune systems generally manifest minimal clinical symptoms and do not necessitate any form of treatment. However, patients who have hypo-immunity require prompt medical attention due to the potential manifestation of severe symptoms that affect multiple systems of the body. Long latency and atypical clinical manifestations are characteristics of CSD. <italic>Bartonella</italic> isolation and identification are challenging procedures that require specialized equipment. There is no gold standard method for CSD diagnosis, and misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis rates are typically high. We present the case of a middle-aged male patient who developed fever, chills, anal distension, dizziness, and muscle pain for 10 days. The patient had a documented history of cat bites 1 month prior to the onset of symptoms. Following admission, he underwent an examination to determine superficial lymphadenopathy and hypoimmunity. Additionally, he had a fever during the disease.

Bacteria migrating to colon tissue at 12 h sepsis were mainly from colonic contents, while those at 48 h were predominantly from the lung tissue. The migratory microbial components in colon tissue were widely associated with blood indicators and colonizing genus abundance and microbiota functionality in colon tissue. In this study, the temporal dynamics of bacterial translocation from various sources into colon tissues at different sepsis progression stages were characterized for the first time, and the species composition of these migrating microbes was delineated.

Obesity-related asthma is a special phenotype of asthma with a complex pathogenesis. Its occurrence and development are related to mechanical compression, inflammatory response, metabolic regulation, gene regulation, and vitamin D deficiency. Different treatment strategies used in the process of weight loss have a beneficial impact on asthma. Alterations in gut and airway microbial community structure and their metabolites may also contribute to obesity-related asthma. The role of the Th17/Treg balance in the gut microbiota regulating the immune responses and host metabolism is important. Therapeutic measures associated with the gut microbiota variety may contribute to improving chronic inflammation associated with obesity by regulating the Th17/Treg balance. An early reduction in microbial diversity can predict the development of asthma and lead to allergy through an imbalance of Th2/Th1 responses. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) regulate the differentiation and activation of regulatory T cells, thereby regulating immune homeostasis in the lung to suppress allergic inflammation and weight gain. Therefore, clarifying the microbial mechanism of obesity-related asthma has important guiding significance for clinical treatment.

It involves applying lytic bacteriophages that self-replicate and induce cell lysis, thus killing their hosts. Nevertheless, bacterial killing promotes the selection of resistant clones which sometimes may exhibit a decrease in bacterial virulence or antibiotic resistance.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In this work, we studied the <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> lytic phage φDCL-PA6 and its variant φDCL-PA6α. Additionally, we characterized and evaluated the production of virulence factors and the virulence in a Galleria mellonella model of resistant mutants against each phage for PA14 and two clinical strains.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Phage φDCL-PA6α differs from the original by only two amino acids: one in the baseplate wedge subunit and another in the tail fiber protein. According to genomic data and cross-resistance experiments, these changes may promote the change of the phage receptor from the O-antigen to the core lipopolysaccharide. Interestingly, the host range of the two phages differs as determined against the <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> reference strains PA14 and PAO1 and against nine multidrug-resistant isolates from ventilator associated pneumonia.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We show as well that phage resistance impacts virulence factor production. Specifically, phage resistance led to decreased biofilm formation, swarming, and type III secretion; therefore, the virulence towards Galleria mellonella was dramatically attenuated. Furthermore, antibiotic resistance decreased for one clinical strain. Our study highlights important potential advantages of phage therapy’s evolutionary impact that may be exploited to generate robust therapy schemes.</p></sec>',NULL,'','2024-01-17 00:00:00','Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology','',NULL,'2024-01-17 16:38:18','saved');

Early initiation of antifungal therapy is associated with reduced mortality of ICA, but rapid diagnosis remains a challenge. The ICA-associated changes in the gut microbiota can be used as diagnostic and therapeutic targets but have been poorly investigated. In this study, we utilized an immunodeficient Rag2γc (<italic>Rag2</italic>-/-<italic>il2γc</italic>-/-) mouse model to investigate the gut microbiota alterations caused by <italic>C. albicans</italic> throughout its cycle, from its introduction into the gastrointestinal tract to invasion, in the absence of antibiotics. We observed a significant increase in the abundance of <italic>Firmicutes</italic>, particularly <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> and <italic>Ruminococcaceae</italic>, as well as a significant decrease in the abundance of <italic>Candidatus Arthromitus</italic> in mice exposed to either the wild-type SC5314 strain or the filamentation-defective mutant (<italic>cph1/cph1 efg1/efg1</italic>) HLC54 strain of <italic>C. albicans</italic>. However, only the SC5314-infected mice developed ICA. A linear discriminate analysis of the temporal changes in the gut bacterial composition revealed <italic>Bacteroides vulgatus</italic> as a discriminative biomarker associated with SC5314-infected mice with ICA. Additionally, a positive correlation between the <italic>B. vulgatus</italic> abundance and fungal load was found, and the negative correlation between the <italic>Candidatus Arthromitus</italic> abundance and fungal load after exposure to <italic>C. albicans</italic> suggested that <italic>C. albicans</italic> might affect the differentiation of intestinal Th17 cells. Our findings reveal the influence of pathogenic <italic>C. albicans</italic> on the gut microbiota and identify the abundance of <italic>B. vulgatus</italic> as a microbiota signature associated with ICA in an immunodeficient mouse model.</p>',NULL,'','2024-01-17 00:00:00','Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology','',NULL,'2024-01-17 16:38:18','saved');

A total of 67 clinically isolated strains, namely 27 strains of <italic>Aspergillus</italic> spp., 16 strains of <italic>Candida</italic> spp., and 24 strains of dematiaceous fungi, were studied. C. parapsilosis (ATCC 22019) and A. flavus (ATCC 204304) was included to ensure quality control.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>PPIs individually did not exert any significant antifungal activity. The combination of OME with ITC, POS, or VRC showed synergism against 77.6%, 86.6%, and 4% strains of tested pathogenic fungi, respectively, while synergism of OME/FLC was observed in 50% strains of <italic>Candida</italic> spp. Synergism between PAN and ITC, POS, or VRC was observed against 47.8%, 77.6% and 1.5% strains of tested fungi, respectively, while synergism of PNA/FLC was observed in 50% strains of <italic>Candida</italic> spp. Synergism of LAN with ITC, POS, or VRC was observed against 86.6%, 86.6%, and 3% of tested strains, respectively, while synergism of LAN/FLC was observed in 31.3% strains of <italic>Candida</italic> spp. Synergy of the combination of RAB with ITC, POS, or VRC was observed against 25.4%, 64.2%, and 4.5% of tested strains, respectively., synergism of RAB/FLC was observed in 12.5% of <italic>Candida</italic> spp.. Among PPIs, synergism was least observed between RAB and triazoles, while among triazoles, synergism was least observed between VRC and PPIs. Among species, synergy was much more frequently observed in Aspergillus spp. and dematiaceous fungi as compared to <italic>Candida</italic> spp. Antagonism between PPIs with ITC or VRC was occasionally observed in <italic>Aspergillus</italic> spp. and dematiaceous fungi. It is notable that PPIs combined with azoles showed synergy against azole resistant <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>, and resulted in category change of susceptibility of ITC and POS against <italic>Candida</italic> spp.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The results suggested that PPIs combined with azoles has the potential to enhance the susceptibilities of azoles against multiple pathogenic fungi and could be a promising strategy to overcome azole resistance issues.
