Good morning.

The Senate has made significant progress towards ending the longest US government shutdown in history, [narrowly advancing a compromise bill](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/10/us-government-shutdown-update-senate-funding-bill) to reauthorize funding and undo the layoffs of some employees.

**What did the Democrats say about the bill?** “This healthcare crisis is so severe, so urgent, so devastating for families back home, that I cannot in good faith support this \[resolution\] that fails to address the healthcare crisis,” said Chuck Schumer, the Democratic majority leader.

**What has the IDF said in response?** In a written statement, the IDF said it “remains committed to the rule of law and continues to operate in accordance with its legal and ethical obligations, despite the unprecedented operational complexity posed by Hamas’s systematic embedding within civilian infrastructure and its use of civilian sites for military purposes”.

No league sells parity like the NFL: it’s the entire brand. But through 10 weeks of this season, this isn’t a league that is equally balanced between the good, the bad and the mediocre. It’s one where most of the league is simply _fine._

In the NFC, at least, there is some clarity. The Rams and Seahawks (both 7-2) look like the most complete teams in football, and secured blowout wins on Sunday. The 6-2 Eagles, despite their struggles, still have one of the most talented rosters in the league, likewise with the Packers (5-2-1).

The administrator for the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), Mehmet Oz, recently claimed that an audit revealed “more than $1bn of federal taxpayer dollars were being spent on funding Medicaid for illegal immigrants”, but experts say the audits were unrelated to immigration, and that rhetoric like this could make immigrant families – regardless of legal status – afraid to seek necessary medical care.

Leo Cuello, a research professor at Georgetown University’s Center for Children and Families, noted that he has not “seen what this audit is”, but “based on the reporting, it appears that it is related to administrative errors in state claiming for matching funds, which is a relatively common occurrence, and which CMS monitors closely as they should”.

The [US Senate](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-senate) on Sunday took a key vote on a bill that would end the record-setting federal government shutdown without extending the healthcare subsidies that Democrats have demanded.

Chemical-laden dust from southern [California](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california)’s drying Salton Sea is likely harming the lungs of people around the shrinking body of water, and the effects are especially pronounced in children, new [peer-reviewed research](https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1164/rccm.202504-0799RL) from the University of California, Irvine, shows.

A separate [peer-reviewed study](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/msphere.00209-25) from the University of California, Riverside, also found the Salton Sea’s contaminated dust seemed to alter lung microbiome, which could trigger pulmonary issues that have been reported around the lake.

The national conversation about crime is being driven by rhetorical attacks – and national guard call-ups – by [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump), who routinely demonizes places like Chicago, Washington DC, Portland and even New York City, which has a lower homicide rate than Orlando, Florida, home to Disneyland.

Somehow, we don’t talk about Birmingham.

While Democratic leaders continue to invest their hopes in a “ [blue wave](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/03/democrats-blue-wave-2026-midterms-00489291)” to overturn Republican majorities in the [House](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/house-of-representatives) and [Senate](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-senate) next year, Trump and some prominent supporters have sought to discredit the possibility that Republicans could lose in a fair fight and are using that premise to justify demands for a drastically different kind of electoral system.

The annual migration of hundreds of thousands of Canadian “snowbirds” escaping freezing temperatures in their homeland and heading to warmer US states such as Florida for the duration of the winter could be about to become noticeably thinner.

Many have ditched plans to visit their southern neighbor and are looking to spend their valuable dollars elsewhere, largely put off by Donald Trump’s [escalating economic war](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/25/trump-tariffs-canada-ronald-reagan) with Canada and [strict new immigration rules](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/13/canada-fingerprint-visit-us) that have created fear and confusion.

The California hunter who [spent](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/05/california-man-survived-wilderness) nearly three weeks stranded in the frosty, mountainous wilderness reportedly survived by rationing out the little food he brought with him – eating 70 or fewer calories daily for a stretch – as well as consuming melted snow to stay hydrated.

Yet before his 1 November rescue, 65-year-old Ron Dailey was so unsure whether anyone would save him that he tried to text his family regrets for possibly missing the rest of their lives – while assuring them that he would watch them “from heaven”.

Magical thinking is indispensable to understanding Team Trump’s economic policymaking. The White House often seems to believe two opposing policies can work together while one policy can do two or three contradictory things.

A heavy dose of hocus pocus will be needed to make the administration’s dollar policy work in the interest of the United States, for it appears that they want to end the US dollar’s supremacy in global finance.

Across the country, Donald Trump’s crackdown on immigrants has shaken neighbourhoods, torn apart families and engendered a sense of panic among communities. But in New York, on Tuesday night, Zohran Mamdani, the first Muslim mayor of New York, and an immigrant from Uganda, chose to underline his identity. “New York will remain a city of immigrants: a city built by immigrants, powered by immigrants and, as of tonight, led by an immigrant,” he told an ecstatic crowd at Paramount theater in Brooklyn.

The son of a Muslim father and a Hindu mother, he was born in Kampala, raised in New York, and identifies as a democratic socialist. Almost every aspect of Mamdani’s identity had been an issue of contention during the election. Earlier this week, the Center for Study of Organized Hate published a report highlighting the surge in Islamophobic comments online between July and October, most of which labelled Mamdani as an extremist or terrorist.

I would like to have some words with ESPN broadcaster Chris Fowler about what he said [after Novak Djokovic beat Taylor Fritz](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/03/novak-djokovic-taylor-fritz-us-open-quarter-final-match-report), for the 11th straight time, in the US Open quarter-finals. Look – Fritz is American, Fowler is American – and sports often lend themselves to nationalism. A little bit of disappointment was appropriate. Instead, Fowler invoked the continued drought of American men at the majors: none of them had lifted a trophy since Andy Roddick in 2003, and Fritz had been the last one standing in the tournament.

We all love a narrative, myself included. But come _on._ Even if Fritz had beaten Djokovic for the first time, force of nature Carlos Alcaraz was waiting in the next round, who Fritz has yet to beat in an official match. And if he’d somehow survived that, it would have been defending champion Jannik Sinner in the final, against whom Fritz had lost 10 of the last 11 sets. Alcaraz and Sinner had also split the last seven major titles (and Alcaraz went on to thrash a fatigued Djokovic in the next round). Fritz said in press after the loss that he actually liked his draw, because it presented the opportunity to beat the three best players in the world in succession.

      <source:markdown>Though Latino voters gave sweeping support to Democrats in Tuesday’s elections, they’re not a permanent coalition

Latino voters delivered sweeping support to Democratic candidates across multiple states in Tuesday’s off-year elections, reversing what many Republicans had come to believe was a lasting political realignment after Donald Trump’s historic gains with the community in the 2024 election .

The rapid reversal represents one of the most volatile electoral swings in recent memory and threatens to upend Republican redistricting strategies that banked on sustained support from Latinos, the fastest-growing voting bloc in the country. It also suggests that Trump’s appeal to Latino voters was highly personal rather than an embrace of the Republican party itself – a miscalculation that could reshape the landscape heading into the 2026 midterms.

James Dewey Watson, whose co-discovery of the twisted-ladder structure of DNA in 1953 helped light the long fuse on a revolution in medicine, crimefighting, genealogy and ethics, has died, according to his former research lab. He was 97.

The breakthrough – made when the brash, Chicago-born Watson was just 24 – turned him into a hallowed figure in the world of science for decades. But near the end of his life, he faced condemnation and professional censure for offensive remarks, including saying Black people were less intelligent than white people.

The NCAA revoked the eligibility of six men’s college basketball players for allegations of sports betting on Friday in three separate cases at New Orleans, Mississippi Valley and Arizona State.

The NCAA Committee on Infractions released findings from an investigation that concluded Cedquavious Hunter, Dyquavian Short, Jamond Vincent, Donovan Sanders, Alvin Stredic and Chatton ‘BJ’ Freeman manipulated their performances to lose games, not cover betting lines, ensure certain prop bets were reached or provided information that enabled others to do so during the 2024-25 regular season.

In September, the NCAA also banned three college basketball players for betting on their own games at Fresno State and San Jose State.

The violations at New Orleans against Hunter, Short and Vincent came to light after the NCAA received a tip about game manipulation. The NCAA said a student-athlete overheard the three players discuss a third party placing a bet on their game against McNeese State on 28 December 2024. New Orleans lost 86-61.

That same student-athlete reported that during a timeout near the end of the game, Short instructed him not to score any more points. New Orleans suspended all three student-athletes for the remainder of the season while it investigated the allegations.

      <source:markdown>Policy means ‘people will go hungry, food pantries will be overburdened’, says judge. Plus, Tesla shareholders approve $1tn pay package for Musk

Good morning.

A federal judge in Rhode Island [ordered the Trump administration](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/06/ruling-snap-benefits-funding-trump) yesterday to find the money to fully fund food stamps for 42 million low-income Americans in November by today, in a rebuke to the government’s plan to only provide reduced aid during the shutdown.

**What is the impact?** After the administration said on Monday it would [only half](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/03/trump-partially-fund-food-stamps-snap) fund the program, Linda Nageotte, of Feeding America, said: [“One in eight people in our country right now](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/06/snap-cuts-how-to-help) don’t have enough to eat.”

**What’s the shutdown latest?** It’s the longest in history, on to its 38th day. Lawmakers are in talks that could lead to a deal. But some Democratic legislators saw Tuesday’s electoral wins as evidence they should [hold the line](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/06/us-government-shutdown-day-37) to extract significant concessions.

**What** **details do we know** **?** The flight reductions, according to ABC News, will start at 4% on Friday and increase to 10%. Airports in cities including Atlanta, Denver, Dallas, Orlando, Miami, LA, San Francisco, New York, Houston and Chicago will be affected.

**What impact could the move** **have?** The cuts could represent as many as 1,800 flights and upwards of 268,000 seats combined, according to an estimate by the aviation analytics firm Cirium. They are likely to create a cascade of scheduling issues and delays at some of the country’s largest airports.

Stella Barey has an hour for lunch. At 1.30pm, she loads her banged-up Tacoma with her three Belgian malinois and drives to a secret Los Angeles hiking trail. There, she gulps down a tapioca pudding and laces up her sneakers. After checking over her shoulder for foot traffic, she pulls down her brown sweatpants and jiggles her bare ass for the camera.

      <source:markdown>President jets in to speak at ritzy American Business Forum as millions see their food aid slashed – crisis, what crisis?

It was the week in which Republicans took a beating at the polls, the government shutdown became the longest in history, and [42 million people](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/03/trump-snap-benefits-reactions) across the country, including 3 million in Florida, saw their federal food aid slashed.

But in the alternative reality of Miami, where tickets to an overwhelmingly conservative business conference headlined by Donald Trump cost up to $1,990, and billionaires from Saudi Arabia rubbed shoulders with equally wealthy American tycoons such as Jeff Bezos and Ken Griffin, those events created barely a ripple.

Nancy Pelosi’s announcement that, after nearly four decades in Congress, she will not seek re-election has reignited interest in the race for her long-held San Francisco seat.

The retirement of the former speaker of the House was long-anticipated, and two Democrats had already declared their intent to run. Saikat Chakrabarti, a former tech executive who previously served as the chief of staff to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Scott Wiener, a state senator, kicked off their campaigns this year.

The supreme court on Thursday allowed Donald Trump’s administration to enforce a policy blocking transgender and non-binary people from choosing passport sex markers that align with their gender identity.

The decision by the high court’s conservative majority is Trump’s latest win on the high court’s emergency docket, and it means his administration can enforce the policy while a lawsuit over it plays out. It halts a lower-court order requiring the government to keep letting people choose male, female or X on their passport to line up with their gender identity on new or renewed passports.

It’s now day 37 of the ongoing government shutdown, the longest on record, with both parties continuing to blame the other for the lapse in funding.

For his part, Donald Trump has turned his attention to the filibuster – the procedural mechanism that requires 60 votes in the Senate to end debate on a piece of legislation and bring it to the floor for a vote. He’s hammered home his wishes on Truth Social, and in front of lawmakers at a White House breakfast on Tuesday.

      <source:markdown>Ruling comes in response to a challenge to administration’s offer to only partly fund US food benefits amid shutdown

A federal judge in [Rhode Island](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/rhode-island) ordered the [Trump administration](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration) Thursday to find the money to fully fund Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap) benefits for November.

The ruling by US district judge John J McConnell Jr gave the Trump administration until Friday to make the payments through Snap, though it is unlikely the people that rely on it will see the money on the debit cards they use for groceries that quickly.

New York, Los Angeles and Chicago airports are among 40 that will see reductions in flights from Friday as a result of the [government shutdown](https://apnews.com/article/government-shutdown-longest-trump-republican-senators-democrats-9712df6c11ef19c5df8f18c8a4f7b341), according to a list distributed to the airlines.

The Associated Press published the list after airline regulators identified “high-volume markets” where air traffic will be reduced on Friday, a move that would force airlines to cancel thousands of flights and create a cascade of scheduling issues and delays at some of the nation’s largest airports.

This article was amended on 6 November 2025. A previous version said the US government was in its 35th day of shutdown. The correct current number is 37 days.

Gio Reyna and Joe Scally will make their US men’s national team returns in the upcoming international window, while Christian Pulisic is among several regulars set to miss out. But while the Milan midfielder has just recovered from an injury suffered during his most recent time with the national team, Weston McKennie’s absence is a bit more surprising.

Reyna and Scally, both of Borussia Mönchengladbach, are among a 25-player squad named by manager Mauricio Pochettino for two friendlies: against Paraguay on 15 November at Subaru Park in Chester, Pennsylvania, and against Uruguay at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida on 18 November.

Perhaps the most revealing post-mortem on Republicans’ election night meltdown came from the vice-president, [JD Vance](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jd-vance).

After a night that saw Democratic governors elected in New Jersey and [Virginia](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/02/abigail-spanberger-virginia-candidate-governor) after focusing on the rising cost of living, and a New York mayoral campaign victory built on housing access, Vance showed a particular kind of remorse.

Good morning.

There is [still a chance for the world to avoid](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/nov/05/still-a-chance-to-return-to-1-point-5c-climate-goal-researchers-say) the worst ravages of climate breakdown and return to the goal of 1.5C if governments take concerted action on greenhouse gas emissions, according to an assessment.

**How do things stand?** For the past two years, global temperatures have surpassed the [1.5C threshold above preindustrial levels](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jan/10/world-temperature-in-2024-exceeded-15c-for-first-time) set out in the 2015 Paris agreement. A UN Environment Programme report published this week said governments’ current plans would lead to devastating heating of about 2.3-2.5C.

**What has Brazil’s president said** **?** “This \[summit\] is an opportunity for politicians, diplomats, scientists, activists and journalists to witness … the true state of the forests, the planet’s largest river basin, and the millions of people who live in the region,” Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva [wrote for the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/06/brazil-cop-30-truth-world-leaders-climate-crisis-president-lula).

**What is the case about?** Trump has imposed tariffs via the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which in some circumstances grants the president authority to regulate or prohibit international transactions – but only during a national emergency.

**What happens if the court sides against the president?** It would force the White House to reconsider its aggressive tariff policy, which has strained global trade ties.

As the [US federal shutdown](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-federal-government-shutdown-2025/2025/nov/03/all) enters its second month, government workers are accusing the Trump administration of being “out of control” and bullying people who are “simply trying to do their best”.

      <source:markdown>The mayor-elect built the greatest field operation by any political campaign in the city’s history – by getting New Yorkers to talk to eachother. Can Democrats learn from his success?

A federal investigator said a UPS cargo plane’s left wing caught fire and an engine fell off shortly before it crashed and exploded into a huge fireball in Louisville, Kentucky, on Tuesday night, killing at least nine people and injuring 11.

At least 28 National Transportation Safety Board agents arrived at the site and began searching for clues about the possible cause of the disaster, which saw the UPS plane [crash shortly after takeoff](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/04/louisville-plane-crash-airport-kentucky-latest) at the Louisville Muhammad Ali international airport, leaving behind a fiery trail of destruction on the ground and a huge plume of black smoke.

      <source:markdown>In today’s newsletter: With more than 50% of the vote, Mamdani tells supporters: “In this moment of political darkness, New York will be the light”

Good morning. A few hours ago, Zohran Mamdani was declared [the winner of the New York City mayoral election](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/04/zohran-mamdani-mayor-new-york-city) with more than 50% of the vote on the biggest turnout since the 1960s. A rank outsider when the race started, he will become the city’s first Muslim mayor and its youngest in more than 100 years. And as an avowed socialist who has emerged as a national symbol of opposition to Donald Trump, he has given progressive Democrats something they believe is worth fighting for.

It was a good night all over for Democrats, who won governorships [in Virginia](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/04/virginia-governor-abigail-spanberger) and [New Jersey](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/04/new-jersey-election-result-mikie-sherrill-wins-governor-race) and saw voters in California support [a redistricting plan](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/04/california-prop-50-voting-result) designed to counter Republican efforts to redraw the map to their advantage in red states. But Republicans believe Mamdani is a gift for them, too: in frequently racist attacks on his candidacy, they have tarred him as a “Jihadist”, a communist and claimed he represents a new extremity on the left.

_**NHS**_ \| An “ugly” racism reminiscent of the 1970s and 1980s has become worryingly commonplace again in modern Britain and NHS staff are bearing the brunt of it, [Wes Streeting has warned](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/nov/04/nhs-staff-face-ugly-racism-akin-to-the-70s-and-80s-says-wes-streeting). Racist abuse now happens so often that it has become “socially acceptable to be racist”, the health secretary said.

_**Productivity**_ \| Employers have been told in a landmark government review that fixing Britain’s health-related worklessness crisis [will require them to spend £6bn a year](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/nov/05/fixing-britains-worklessness-crisis-will-cost-employers-6bn-a-year-report-says). The report said that a drastic expansion in occupational health was needed to help prevent hundreds of thousands of people from falling out of the workforce.

_**US politics**_ \| Dick Cheney, the divisive US vice-president under George W Bush who helped lead the country into a disastrous invasion of Iraq, [has died](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/04/dick-cheney-vice-president-republican-bush-dies) aged 84.

Trump had repudiated Bush’s invasion of Iraq in his campaign for president, but the congresswoman nonetheless went on to become an ally in bending Republican lawmakers to his will.

- [Dick Cheney, vice-president and giant of Republican politics, dies aged 84](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/04/dick-cheney-vice-president-republican-bush-dies)


Dick Cheney, [who has died aged 84](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/04/dick-cheney-vice-president-republican-bush-dies), came to be seen as a moderate in his later years for his staunch opposition to Donald Trump, but he also stands accused of paving the way for Trumpism by undermining the independence of the intelligence agencies and US adherence to international law.

As George W Bush’s second-in-command in the “war on terror” declared after the 9/11 attacks, Cheney made himself one of the most powerful vice-presidents in US history, and was a key protagonist in the push to invade Iraq, as well as the use of torture on suspected al-Qaida members detained without charge in the CIA’s offshore “black sites”.

Californians headed to the polls on Tuesday to decide on Proposition 50, a ballot measure of national significance that could play a major role in determining which party controls the [US House of Representatives](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/house-of-representatives) after the 2026 midterms.

If voters approve the proposal, the state will halt the work of its independent redistricting commission and allow the legislature to redraw congressional districts to carve out five additional Democratic congressional seats. The effort is a direct attempt to neutralize [Texas](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/texas)’s partisan gerrymander, undertaken at the request of [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump), to create several new safe Republican districts.

A [Pennsylvania](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pennsylvania) artist’s efforts to create a Halloween float for a local Catholic school went awry when he inadvertently included a replica of the gateway arch from a Nazi concentration camp, prompting a hasty apology from the diocese of Harrisburg.

Six people have died and several dozen have been hospitalized across the [US](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news) after an outbreak of listeria in precooked pasta meals.

      <source:markdown>Oral arguments over the Trump administration&#39;s &#34;reciprocal tariffs&#34; are set for tomorrow, in a test over limits to a president&#39;s power to act without Congress.

      <source:markdown>President’s pressure on the department to prosecute his enemies is hurting US law and violating policies, say experts

Donald Trump’s intense pressure on the US Department of Justice (DoJ) to charge key foes with crimes based on dubious evidence and his ongoing investigations of other political enemies is hurting the rule of law in the US and violating departmental policies, which scholars and ex-prosecutors say may help scuttle some charges.

They also voice dismay about charges filed against ex-FBI director [James Comey](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/james-comey) and [Letitia James](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/letitia-james), the New York attorney general, by Lindsey Halligan, the ex-White House lawyer and novice prosecutor, who Trump installed in a key US attorney post after forcing out a veteran prosecutor who deemed the cases weak.

Good morning.

The Trump administration said it would provide only partial relief to recipients of food stamps on Monday, amid mounting uncertainty among the nearly 42 million people on the supplemental nutrition assistance program (Snap).

**How did we get here?** As a result of the shutdown, Donald Trump has threatened to cut off the food benefits for the first time in the program’s more than 60-year history. A federal judge last week prevented the Department of Agriculture from [suspending](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/31/judge-blocks-trump-snap-suspension) Snap altogether.

**What impact will it have?** There have already been long lines at food banks across the nation. Chris Stein [spoke to people](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/03/trump-snap-benefits-reactions) affected, with many saying they would have to scrimp on food to get by. “I’m dumbfounded by the cruelty,” one said.

**Can Trump even do that?** The president does not directly determine how much money any city receives from the federal government; appropriation is the constitutional function of Congress. But control over how money is spent – or withheld in acts of impoundment, which are forbidden under federal law – has become a point of [legal contention](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/03/trump-mamdani-new-york-election-mayor-cuomo).

**What do New York polls say?** A recent survey from [AtlasIntel](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/polls/nyc-mayoral-election-polls-2025.html) showed Mamdani, the Democratic nominee, on 44%, the independent Andrew Cuomo on 39% and the Republican Curtis Sliwa on 16%.

On 26 October, Angel City FC’s Elizabeth Eddy made her first post on X in nearly two years. In it, Eddy in essence responded to the Guardian’s report that the NWSL had [quietly dropped](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/15/nwsl-and-us-soccers-lack-of-transgender-policy-targeted-by-conservative-lobby-groups) its inclusion policy for trans and intersex athletes, leaving the league’s future stance on the matter undecided.

The New York Post gave Eddy’s writing a signal boost the next day, [republishing it in full](https://nypost.com/2025/10/27/opinion/national-womens-soccer-league-must-adopt-gender-standards-to-keep-growing/).

      <source:markdown>Veterans groups say recent Washington Post stories on VA disability payments paint a misleading picture. The paper stands by its reporting

In October, the [Washington Post](https://www.theguardian.com/media/washington-post) reported that it had uncovered “rampant exaggeration and fraud” in the US Department of Veterans Affairs’ disability benefits system.

“Military veterans are swamping the US government with dubious disability claims … exploiting the country’s sacred commitment to compensate those harmed in the line of duty,” the newspaper [reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/interactive/2025/veterans-affairs-disability-claims-fraud/).

One year after [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump) won his way back into the White House, voters are going back to the ballot box in a test of the president’s popularity and whether Democrats are able to rebound from their catastrophic losses of 2024.

With governor’s mansions, mayoral offices, statehouses and mid-cycle redistricting on the line in closely watched contests from Trenton, New Jersey and Richmond, Virginia to New York City and beyond, the party is pinning its hopes on locally rooted campaigns aiming to blunt a national conservative message that has surged in recent years.

Andrew Wiggins was among the first superstar prospects of the social media era. Born in Thornhill, Ontario just north of Toronto, Wiggins was known internationally by the time he was 13. It wasn’t always easy for the shy, small-town kid to embrace the spotlight.

After just one full season at Vaughan, Wiggins needed better competition than Canada could provide and moved on to Huntington Prep in Huntington, West Virginia — a relatively new prep school set in a small, blue-collar, sports-oriented college town near Kansas.

      <source:markdown>Democratic leaders decry ‘unbelievably cruel’ move, saying ‘Trump is using food as a weapon’ during shutdown

Senate [Republicans](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans) shot down a Democratic-led attempt to fully fund Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap) benefits on Monday during the government shutdown – a move that heightens uncertainty for the 42 million Americans participating in the country’s biggest anti-hunger program.

Jeff Merkley, a Democratic senator, and Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader, attempted to pass a [resolution](https://www.merkley.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/Merkley-Schumer-SNAP-Resolution.pdf) via unanimous consent that would have forced the Department of Agriculture to fund Snap benefits for the month of November.

Across the country, Americans who depend on government help to buy groceries are preparing for the worst.

Looking ahead, on Wednesday, **the supreme court will hear arguments on whether Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs on dozens of countries are legal.** It’s set to be one of the most consequential rulings on the expanse of Trump’s presidential power in his second term.

My colleague, **Eduardo Porter**, has this helpful breakdown on the question at the heart of this case. A dozen states have challenged the president’s contention that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) of 1977 gives him the power to impose tariffs on imports from every country in the world to defend the nation from a several “threats” facing the US.

Justices will focus much of their attention on whether IEEPA authorizes the president to [levy a tariff](https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/court-filings/state-of-oregon-et-al-v-donald-j-trump-united-states-department-of-homeland-security-et-al-complaint-2025.pdf) – a word that is not mentioned in the text of the law and is, moreover, a form of taxation, over which, per the constitution, Congress has exclusive power.

IEEPA [gives the president](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1701) authority “to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States, if the president declares a national emergency with respect to such threat”.

Throwing a sandwich at a federal agent turned Sean Charles Dunn into a symbol of resistance against [Donald Trump’s](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump) law-enforcement surge in the nation’s capital. This week, federal prosecutors are trying to persuade a jury of fellow Washington DC residents that Dunn simply broke the law.

That could be a tough sell for the government in a city that has chafed against Trump’s federal takeover, which is entering its third month.

- Washington QB suffered dislocated elbow


Washington Commanders head coach Dan Quinn has accepted he shares some of the blame for a serious injury to the team’s quarterback, Jayden Daniels.

Daniels, who had [one of the greatest rookie campaigns](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jan/21/can-jayden-daniels-and-the-commanders-continue-their-fairytale-playoff-run) of all time last season, suffered a dislocated left elbow in Sunday’s loss to the Seattle Seahawks. Although Daniels throws with his right arm, the injury has left his season in doubt. The injury was serious enough that the television broadcast did not show replays and several players turned away as Daniels was treated my medical staff.

The first time the Blue Jays won a World Series, in 1992, the team’s victory parade was held on the same day as a contentious national referendum. At play that day was a suite of potential constitutional changes that had Canadians, living through a period of economic strain, regional tension, and a growing distrust of political elites, questioning what kind of country they were living in. The referendum failed and paved the way for another, three years later, in 1995, that almost saw Quebec leave Canada altogether. Following the win, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney congratulated the Jays noting that, beyond it being a “historic victory” the team’s playoff run “united a nation behind you, capturing the imagination of Canadians from coast to coast.” It was something Canada needed.

This time there was no parade. The Jays lost 5-4 to the LA Dodgers in the early hours of Sunday in [a heartbreaking Game 7](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/nov/02/dodgers-win-world-series-game-7-blue-jays-baseball), missing out on their first World Series title in 32 years.

Political writer and commentator Jack Schlossberg has said it was “disgusting, desperate and dangerous” for actor [Julia Fox](https://www.theguardian.com/film/julia-fox) to wear a Halloween costume evoking the assassination of president [John F Kennedy](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/john-f-kennedy), his grandfather.

Fox, however, has defended her controversial decision to wear a replica of the blood-stained, pink suit that former first lady Jackie Kennedy was seen wearing when her husband was shot dead by a sniper while the couple rode in a motorcade in Dallas in 1963. The Uncut Gems star has said she dressed as Jackie Kennedy as “a statement” about the poise and “extraordinary bravery” she showed when subjected to unimaginable “brutality”.

He has since invoked emergencies more than any president since the passage of the National Emergencies Act in 1976.

Republicans and Democrats have entered a war in legislatures and courts to narrow the political battlefield of 2026 before a single vote is cast.

Normally, redistricting only occurs after the US census counts residents in each state every 10 years. A demand from Donald Trump to lock in more Republican-leaning districts in Congress, together with a changing legal landscape around partisan gerrymandering, set off a chain of mid-decade reapportionments.

- Smith’s 11th-inning home run breaks deadlock

- LA clinch first repeat championship since 2000


**Dodgers 0-0 Blue Jays, end of first inning**

A bit of confusion here. Ohtani takes the mound a bit late and has yet to throw a warm-up pitch at the time the Blue Jays are ready to bat. The home-play umpire is giving him a little extra time.

George Springer takes three straight balls from Ohtani before taking a strike. The Toronto DH, back from an oblique injury, then rips a line drive to left field for a leadoff single. The crowd explodes.

Nathan Lukes goes down 1-2 in the count and fights off a few more pitches before striking out swinging on a splitter.

Vladimir Guerrero Jr works the count to 3-2, then takes a 100mph fastball right down the middle for a called strikeout ... before catcher Will Smith fires down to second to catch Springer stealing. The strikeout double play abruptly ends the inning. Both teams get leadoff hits in the first inning but neither can take advantage.

Ohtani takes two balls, fouls off a cutter, then singles to right-field off a changeup.

Will Smith grounds out to first base, making the first out but moving Ohtani into scoring position.

Freeman jumps on the first pitch and flies out to center for the second out, but Ohtani tags up and takes third.

Betts takes a ball, then grounds out to short to roars from the Rogers Centre crowd. It’s a scoreless first inning for Scherzer.

The Los Angeles Dodgers won their second consecutive title in stunning fashion in the early hours of Sunday morning, depriving the Toronto Blue Jays of a first World Series in 32 years in a stomach-churning, epic Game 7.

The race has become an increasingly bitter face-off, laced with alleged racism and Islamophobia, but it is the political differences between the two main candidates that could have major implications for how the Democratic party performs in next year’s midterm elections.

      <source:markdown>Food insecurity for millions of Americans set to increase with Trump officials saying Snap benefits will cease as government shutdown enters second month

Waves of hungry Angelenos gathered outside Community Space food bank’s storefront on a recent afternoon, grabbing dry goods like pastries, bagels, lentils and pasta along with refrigerated salads and frozen bags of brisket.

Good morning.

The Trump administration is going to [restrict the number of refugees](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/30/trump-refugee-restrictions-white-south-africans) it admits into the US next year to the token level of just 7,500 – and those spots will mostly be filled by white South Africans.

**What reason has been given for prioritizing white South Africans?** The Trump administration has repeatedly claimed that the South African government is implementing anti-white policies through a new land expropriation law. The South African government has called the claims false.

Officials said at the time that Carlitos Ricardo Parias, a TikTok creator with a large following, had attempted to ram federal agents’ vehicles after agents surrounded him and boxed in his car.

The historic shifts in US immigration under [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump) have been dictated by a relentless voice over a telephone line: Stephen Miller, the president’s [immigration](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usimmigration) czar, who in recent months has turned the state department’s visa and refugee operations into what some current and former diplomats have described as a personal fiefdom.

Each morning, usually at 10am, a small circle of conservative diplomats allied with Miller, including those who have assumed control of the state department’s consular and refugee operations, dial in for what some have termed the “Stephen Miller call”, an interagency discussion of immigration measures led by Miller, the White House’s homeland security adviser.

Crowley Place is a sleepy street in the Waynewood area of south Alexandria, Virginia, a suburb 30 minutes from DC. The unassuming homes are well-tended, and it’s a quick walk to six different churches.

But each year at Halloween the police shut down the street as thousands of visitors flock to the area. It’s all due to two ageing brothers who spent 40 years working together in secret at a laboratory in the CIA.

My beloved friend Pancho is an off-track thoroughbred who has been with me for 24 years. In his youth, in the early 2000s, he soldiered through a vigorous mid-level career on the competitive tracks of Southern California. At nearly 28 now his life is approaching its natural end.

On Donald Trump’s whirlwind tour of Asia – [which involved stops in Malaysia, Japan and Korea](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/24/trump-asia-tour-key-questions-xi-jinping-china-japan-south-korea-malaysia) – the US president triumphantly collected new trade deals from countries hoping for a reduction in the tariffs he slapped on them earlier this year.

      <source:markdown>The Ballydoyle squadron is at the heart of the European challenge in California this weekend

Aidan O’Brien’s gallop towards an extension of his record for Group One wins in a season has slowed a little in recent weeks, but there was still a shield-beating sense of theatre about the scene as his team for the 2025 Breeders’ Cup meeting at Del Mar this weekend made its way to the track for morning exercise on Wednesday.

Unlike 2024, when City Of Troy was being aimed at the Classic, there is no obvious headliner in the O’Brien lineup, but plenty of the horses trotting past in a well-ordered single file have banked at least one Group One already this season and four are expected to set off as favourite.

      <source:markdown>We’re interested to hear how the looming pause of Snap benefits, as well as rising insurance costs due to a loss of subsidies, could affect Americans

More than 40 million Americans will stop receiving food stamps on 1 November, as the US government shutdown enters its fifth week.

The Department of Agriculture says the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap) will be suspended until Congress reopens the government. While the Trump administration argues the department does not have the legal authority to use a $5bn contingency fund to continue the aid, Democrats disagree, and two dozen states [have sued](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/28/food-stamps-lawsuit-states-sue-trump-administration) the government to force the program to continue.

- [Five key takeaways from Trump-Xi meeting](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/30/five-key-takeaways-donald-trump-meeting-xi-jinping-china-us-trade-talks)


When Donald Trump launched his trade war against China in April, threatening tariffs as high as 145%, the Chinese government said it would never bow to blackmail and vowed to “fight to the end”.

The question now is whether the [consensus reached between Trump and Xi Jinping](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/30/trump-and-xi-meet-in-south-korea-for-crunch-talks-on-trade) in Busan, South Korea, on Thursday means that the fight really has come to an end, and if so on whose terms.

Good morning.

Donald Trump has said that [Washington and Beijing have settled their dispute over rare earths](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/30/trump-and-xi-meet-in-south-korea-for-crunch-talks-on-trade) after crucial trade talks with the Chinese president in South Korea.

**What else was agreed?** Trump said China would axe its restrictions on rare earth exports, in a deal he said would last one year before being negotiated annually, and also buy US soya beans.

**Was Taiwan discussed?** No. And while Ukraine was discussed, Trump said that the topic of Chinese use of Russian oil was not really discussed.

**When did the U** **S** **last hold a full nuclear weapons test?** In 1992 – and neither China nor Russia are known to have held any such tests since the same period. It is unclear what weapons testing could take place.

      <source:markdown>Group of 11 Democratic senators has raised concerns about use of Wrap full-body restraints on US deportation flights

A “near-total secrecy” surrounding deportation flights and the use of full-body restraints onboard is raising “serious human rights concerns”, a group of 11 Democratic US senators wrote in a letter on Thursday to top immigration officials.

Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland called upon US Immigration and Customs Enforcement to provide a full accounting of its air operations and to stop using the black and yellow restraints known as the Wrap until the agency explains its policies for the device and resolves other questions about its use on immigration detainees.

More than three months after their last match, the US women’s national team returned to the pitch in October, playing three games with varied results.

The price increases could mean popular candy like Tootsie Rolls and Hershey’s chocolate and variety packs are a few dollars more expensive than just a year ago.

      <source:markdown>Guardian analysis finds ICE increasingly keeps people in holding rooms with little oversight, as some facilities see a 600% rise in detention length

[US immigration](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usimmigration) officials have been increasingly detaining people in small, secretive holding facilities for days or even weeks at a time in violation of federal policy, a Guardian investigation has found.

These holding facilities – located at ICE offices, in federal buildings and other locations around the country – are typically used to detain people after they have been arrested but before they are transferred or released. In many cases, they consist of small concrete rooms with no beds and are designed to only be used for a few hours.

ICE has used at least 170 ICE holding facilities nationwide, including at 25 ICE field offices.

The Trump administration and its campaign of mass deportation has led to a near across the board increase in the time people are forced to spend in detention in holding rooms. After Donald Trump’s inauguration, the average time that people spend in detention increased at 127 hold rooms across the country.

Despite ICE’s rule change in June, the agency is continuing to violate its own policy by detaining people at these sites for multiple days at a time.

In some cases, such as a New York City holding facility located on the 10th floor of a federal building in downtown Manhattan, time in detention increased by nearly 600% on average after the June rule change.

In one case the Guardian discovered by looking through agency data, ICE documented that a 62-year-old man was held inside that same New York City holding facility for two and a half months.

The Guardian also found an additional 63 people at the site who were held there for longer than one week, between Trump’s inauguration and late July.

On a rainy October day, dozens of volunteers showed up at a [Minneapolis](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/minneapolis) park to grab campaign literature they would leave at voters’ doors, hoping to buoy up a democratic socialist into the mayor’s office.

A handful of door-knockers ran into an apartment building to escape the rain, joining Omar Fateh, the mayoral hopeful sometimes dubbed the “Mamdani of Minneapolis”.

Meta reported mixed financial results for the third quarter of 2025.

[Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump)’s effort to get his justice department to pay him hundreds of millions of dollars is based on specious legal claims that would likely be rejected if he were any other American, according to a legal expert and a former Department of Justice official who handled damages claims against the government.

Trump has asked the justice department to pay him [$230m in damages](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/21/us/politics/trump-justice-department-compensation.html), the New York Times reported last week. The amount is the total of two separate claims in which Trump argues he is entitled to compensation because of investigations into the links between Russia and his 2016 campaign as well as the 2022 search for classified documents at Mar-a-Lago and subsequent criminal prosecution.

The book, the 18th in [the Trump canon](https://www.mostrecommendedbooks.com/series/donald-j-trump-books-in-order), is typically self-aggrandising, with Trump describing his own brand as “one of the world’s great icons of quality and excellence”.

      <source:markdown>Central bank sets rates at range between 3.75% and 4% amid turbulence from government shutdown and Trump’s tariffs

The US Federal Reserve cut interest rates on Wednesday, the second rate cut this year amid economic turbulence from the federal government shutdown and Donald Trump’s tariffs.

      <source:markdown>Enhanced subsidies keeping premiums affordable for millions will expire, threatening to more than double what households pay out of pocket

People in the US shopping for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces will face a steep 26% average price increase next year, according to [new analysis](https://www.kff.org/quick-take/aca-insurers-are-raising-premiums-by-an-estimated-26-but-most-enrollees-could-see-sharper-increases-in-what-they-pay/) from the Kaiser Family Foundation released just days before enrollment begins on 1 November.

State-run marketplaces are also expected to experience a 17% increase.

It’s 6.30pm on Sunday evening and LA Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford is speaking to reporters in an unpleasant-smelling makeshift press room in Wembley Stadium when he is interrupted by a booming voice from behind a curtain. It’s teammate Davante Adams shouting “Whose house?” in delight after his three touchdowns in the romp over Jacksonville Jaguars.

Adams knows what it means to score a hat-trick at Wembley but he is less certain about what day it is. “I feel like I’m connected to the country and the people now,” he says. With the game kicking off at 6.30am back home on the west coast, the Rams had taken the lead before most of their fans had settled on the sofa with their morning coffee.

Good morning.

Humanity has failed to limit global heating to 1.5C and must change course immediately, [the secretary general of the UN has warned](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/oct/28/change-course-now-humanity-has-missed-15c-climate-target-says-un-head).

But over the past year, she says her business, which includes an international money transfer kiosk, has taken a major hit.

      <source:markdown>- Dodgers win in 18, tying longest World Series game

- Ohtani reaches base postseason-record nine times

- LA lead 2-1 in series ahead of Tuesday’s Game 4


It took Freddie Freeman three chances to get it just right.

When the Los Angeles Dodgers first baseman drove a fastball deep into centerfield in the bottom of the 13th inning, the home fans at Dodger Stadium groaned as the ball nestled into Toronto Blue Jays centerfielder Daulton Varsho’s glove to make Game 3 of the 2025 World Series just the fifth World Series game to ever reach the 14th inning. Two innings later, Freeman hit the ball even harder, but not quite high enough as Varsho chased it down before it could reach the centerfield wall. The two teams were now playing the second-longest World Series game of all-time.

[Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump) said on Monday morning that he would rule out running for the vice-presidency in the 2028 US election, an unorthodox approach that some of his supporters have floated to allow the Republican US president to serve a third term in the White House.

“I’d be allowed to do that,” Trump said, in an exchange with reporters aboard Air Force One while traveling from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Tokyo, Japan, on Monday, the latest leg of a five-day trip to Asia which he hopes to cap with an agreement on a [trade war truce](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/27/us-china-framework-trade-deal-xi-trump-meeting) with the Chinese president, [Xi Jinping](https://www.theguardian.com/world/xi-jinping).

A faltering federal response to one of the worst storms in [Alaska](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/alaska)’s history, which caused hundreds of people to become homeless, is drawing further scrutiny over the [Trump administration](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration)’s efforts to dismantle federal weather and climate protections.

[The powerful remnants of Typhoon Halong hit remote communities](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/15/alaska-typhoon-halong-aftermath) in the Yukon-Kuskokwim delta of south-west Alaska on 12 October, inundating a vast low-lying area of tundra that is home to some of the most remote and inaccessible communities in the country.

Good morning.

The US and China have [agreed a framework for a trade deal](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/27/us-china-framework-trade-deal-xi-trump-meeting) only days before Donald Trump and the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, are due to meet.

**What about other trade deals that are still up in the air?** There were hopes of a truce between the US and Brazil after what President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva described as a positive meeting with Trump in Malaysia. He said their respective teams would start discussing tariffs and other matters “immediately”.

**And Canada?** Trump said Saturday that he would [raise US tariffs by 10%](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/25/trump-tariffs-canada-ronald-reagan) in retaliation for an [advertisement](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/24/trump-canada-trade-negotations-ontario-tariffs) sponsored by the Ontario government that accurately quoted Ronald Reagan at length saying tariffs don’t work.

**How many people have been killed in the airstrikes?** US forces in recent weeks have carried out at least eight strikes against boats in the Caribbean off Venezuela’s coast, killing about 40 people that the Trump administration has insisted were involved in smuggling drugs.

It all started so well. And then it fell apart.

For two quarters, it looked like Aaron Rodgers might conjure one of those nights, the sort that ends with a smirk, a wink, and a reminder that he can match any of the league’s young pups. It was the first time in his career that he played against Green Bay, where he spent nearly two decades, won four MVPs [and a lone Super Bowl](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/feb/07/super-bowl-green-bay-packers-pittsburgh-steelers).

Former player and assistant coach Damon Jones, [who allegedly provided](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/46700252/source-bettors-got-privileged-injury-info-lebron-james) “inside information” about NBA games to bettors, was also taken into custody.
