Luc Longley chooses his words carefully when talking about Chicago Bulls point guard Josh Giddey, not wanting to heap any more expectation on the young Australian still finding his feet in the ferocious competition of the NBA.

He says he doesn’t watch every Bulls game these days – only about half of them. That he hasn’t spoken to Giddey much since his move to Illinois. That Longley’s life in Australia, where he part-owns the Sydney Kings and Flames, takes up most of his energies rather than what is happening on the shores of Lake Michigan.

When canvassers fan out across neighborhoods, they usually rely on sophisticated lists that will tell them things like a voter’s political party and how likely they are to support a given cause. Jill Imbler isn’t bothering with any of that.

The 69-year-old has lived in Moberly – a Missouri town of about 14,000 people – her entire life. She doesn’t use a GPS when she drives around, knows where people live, and what time they’re likely to be home.

An aura of Hollywood magic, with a native honor roll that runs from Shirley Temple to Sean Penn.

      <source:markdown>As many as 250 federal agents are expected to descend on the city imminently – despite falling crime

New Orleanians are bracing for a major deployment of US border patrol officers to the city, as Donald Trump forges on with his mass deportation agenda and sweeping federal [immigration crackdown](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usimmigration) in Democrat-led cities.

Despite [falling crime](https://nopdnews.com/post/may-2025/nopd-reports-continued-significant-decrease-in-vio/), as many as 250 federal agents are expected to descend on New Orleans imminently to begin laying the groundwork for “Operation Swamp Sweep”, which [the Associated Press reported](https://apnews.com/article/federal-immigration-crackdown-new-orleans-55119a4cf4e6da418e38287cb20c0ef4) is due to launch in south-east Louisiana and Mississippi on 1 December with the stated aim of arresting 5,000 people.

The [US supreme court](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-supreme-court) on Friday temporarily blocked a lower court ruling that found Texas’s 2026 congressional redistricting plan pushed by [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump) likely discriminated on the basis of race.

The order, signed by Justice Samuel Alito, will remain in place at least for the next few days while the court considers whether to allow the new map, which is favorable to Republicans, to be used in the midterm elections.

The prominent linguist and philosopher [Noam Chomsky](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/noam-chomsky) called it a “most valuable experience” to have maintained “regular contact” with [Jeffrey Epstein](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein), who by then had long been convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor, according to emails released earlier in November this month by US lawmakers.

Such comments from Chomsky, or attributed to him, suggest his association with Epstein – who officials concluded killed himself in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges – went deeper than the occasional political and academic discussions the former [had previously claimed](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/17/jeffrey-epstein-noam-chomsky-bard-college-president) to have with the latter.

Donald [Trump embraced Zohran Mamdani](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/21/trump-mamdani-white-house-new-york), a democratic socialist set to be the first Muslim mayor of New York, like a brother.

And then Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Trump acolyte-turned-nemesis who bested him over the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files, stunned the political establishment again. In what should have been her hour of triumph, the Maga star abruptly [announced that she was quitting](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/21/marjorie-taylor-greene-resigns) the House of Representatives.

When House Democrats released emails which showed Jeffrey Epstein claiming Donald Trump “knew about the girls”, rightwing news channels in the US reacted the same way: with silence.

Viewers of Fox News and other conservative networks would have had no idea that the president [allegedly spent hours](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/12/jeffrey-epstein-new-emails-donald-trump) at Epstein’s home with one of his victims.

The extraordinary exchange was sparked after Democratic lawmakers with military or national security backgrounds – the Congressional representatives Maggie Goodlander, Jason Crow, Chris DeLuzio and Chrissy Houlahan, and the senators Mark Kelly and Elissa Slotkin – posted a [video](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2558895077819811) on Facebook addressed to US service members.

It was hard to choose one favourite photo from football’s double-header at the White House this week. In part this is because the pictures from Donald Trump’s [state dinner with Mohammed bin Salman](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/18/trump-bin-salman-visit-jamal-khashoggi) and his in-house hype men Cristiano Ronaldo and Gianni Infantino were everywhere, recycled feverishly across the internet, dusted with their own drool-stained commentary by the wider Ronaldo-verse.

Mainly there were just so many jaw-droppers.

- Hamilton woes continue with last-place finish for Ferrari


Lando Norris claimed pole position at the Las Vegas Grand Prix in treacherous, wet conditions on the street circuit in Nevada to move one step closer to taking his first Formula One world championship.

The British driver’s march to the title looks increasingly likely with pole at what has been a bogey circuit for McLaren.

Norris beat the Red Bull of Max Verstappen into second and, with his closest title rival and teammate Oscar Piastri in fifth, he can further extend his advantage at the top of the standings on Sunday. Indeed, he had been so cool in advance that he took in spot of shut-eye before it began and then weathered the hazardous conditions with insouciance.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics canceled the release of the closely watched consumer price index (CPI) for October, citing the government shutdown – the longest in history, before it [ended earlier this month](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/12/house-bill-government-shutdown-vote) – and stating it could not “retroactively collect” the data required for the report.

One crisp morning in 2018, Sandra Ibarra pulled on a pair of gloves to ward off the winter chill and picked up the first cardboard sign she had designed for a protest.

As a recent immigrant to the United States, Ibarra was wary of attending a demonstration. But since arriving in the United States from Mexico she had had to change careers – it was difficult to recertify her licensing as an accountant in a new country and easier to begin working in childcare – and was shocked by the poor pay.

The remarkable nature of the transformation in Formula One’s fortunes in the United States could not have been better illustrated than by the incongruous sight of Mickey Mouse and an assortment of his Disney pals leading a gang of enthusiastic fans on a walk down the pit lane at the Las Vegas Grand Prix.

F1 successfully hosting a race in Sin City and the US now boasting three sellout meetings is testament to the sport’s burgeoning prosperity. For all of the somewhat surreal edge of seeing Donald Duck and Goofy outside garages, the fact Disney has chosen F1 as a partner is indicative of the sea change the sport has brought about in a market it has long coveted.

Good morning.

Democrats [expressed outrage](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/20/democrats-condemn-trump-military-video-post) after Donald Trump accused a group of Democratic lawmakers of engaging in “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH” and that they should be arrested after they posted a video in which they told active service members they should refuse illegal orders.

**What did the lawmakers say in the video?** “Our laws are clear: you can refuse illegal orders, you must refuse illegal orders. No one has to carry out orders that violate the law or our constitution.”

**What did the report say?** A “joint situational information report” from the FBI and the New York police department (NYPD), dated 28 August 2025, quoted from a chat on Signal, the encrypted messaging app, and also characterized the court watchers as “anarchist violent extremist actors”.

**Where did it come from?** The two-page report was distributed to other law enforcement agencies across the US. The records were obtained by [Property of the People](https://propertyofthepeople.org/), a government transparency non-profit, through public records requests.

      <source:markdown>The former Blackhawks star is back in the NHL after two and a half years. A pair of retreats in India, and a fresh start with his hometown Jets, helped him rediscover his lost joy

Boosted by cultural phenomena like the hit series Yellowstone and Beyonce’s Cowboy Carter album and tour, rodeo and all things Western are enjoying a cultural resurgence.

- Rookie Calen Bullock seals win with late interception

- Shakir, Cook star but title-tipped Bills fall to 7–4


Little went right for Josh Allen in a frustrating game Thursday night against the Houston Texans. And still he came close to willing the Buffalo Bills to a victory before an interception in the final minute sealed their fate in a 23-19 loss.

Allen took consecutive sacks on the Bills’ final possession, leading to a fourth-and-27, but Buffalo (7-4) gained 44 yards on a short pass from Allen to Josh Palmer, who tossed a lateral to Khalil Shakir. After a false-start penalty created a fourth-and-6 for Buffalo (7-4), Calen Bullock picked off Allen’s pass at the Houston 9 with 24 seconds left.

Good morning.

US and Russian officials have [quietly drafted a new plan to end the war in Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/19/us-and-russian-officials-draft-new-peace-plan-based-on-capitulation-from-ukraine) that would require Kyiv to cede territory and severely cut the size of its military, it was reported on Wednesday, in a development that Kyiv will probably view as surrender.

**Is this plan formally backed by the Trump administration?** That’s still unclear, as Witkoff and Dmitriev have created an informal backchannel.

**What has the EU said?** Any peace plan needs Kyiv and Europe “on board”. Foreign ministers are meeting today to discuss this – [follow our live blog here](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/nov/20/ukraine-russia-peace-plan-european-union-donald-trump-vladimir-putin-kaja-kallas-europe-live-news-updates?page=with%3Ablock-691ed2af8f084e05b1cbbf15#block-691ed2af8f084e05b1cbbf15).

**What will the justice department actually release?** All files related to Epstein – including the investigation into his death by suicide in prison. While they can redact identifying information about victims, it specifically bars officials from declining to disclose information over concerns about “embarrassment, reputational harm or political sensitivity”.

Sergio Busquets didn’t expect to last this long. More than a decade ago, he predicted he’d retire by his early 30s. But when he finally announced in September that he’ll hang up his boots at the end of Inter Miami’s season, he did so as a 37-year-old defensive midfielder who still somehow never leaves the pitch for one of the best teams in MLS.

He could be playing his final game this weekend, if Miami lose their conference semi-final against FC Cincinnati on Sunday.

      <source:markdown>Tucker Carlson’s interview with the activist revealed the mainstream right is being flooded by extremism – and it’s now impossible to contain

Five days a week, thousands of fans gather online to watch Nick Fuentes hold court about the dangers of non-white immigration, feminism and “organized Jewry”. Usually dressed in a dark suit and tie, he lectures to his far-right followers, known as “Groypers”, about what he argues is the insufficient radicalism of Donald Trump’s Republican party and what he describes as the perfidies of the state of Israel and its American supporters.

Fuentes’s fixation with Israel is not rooted in concern about the war in Gaza but a belief, in his telling, that Jews are responsible for most of society’s problems. Fuentes, who is 27 and lives in Illinois, has called Adolf Hitler “really fucking cool” and compared the Holocaust to the baking of cookies.

Healthcare providers across the country have closed clinics and hospital wards in the four months since [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump) signed into law the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the landmark tax-and-spending legislation that will lead an estimated [10 million people to lose their health insurance](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61367).

The law is expected to slash federal funding by hundreds of billions of dollars over the coming years, as part of Trump’s campaign pledge to shrink government spending. Though the bill isn’t thought to be the only cause of the closures – it may have an impact on local healthcare settings that are financially struggling.

      <source:markdown>Experts fear plan, one of many attempts Trump’s made to dismantle wildlife protection, will speed up extinction crisis

The Trump administration presented a new plan to roll back regulations in the Endangered Species Act (ESA) on Wednesday, a move experts fear will accelerate the extinction crisis if adopted.

[The proposed](https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USDOI/bulletins/3fc00d6) [changes](https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USDOI/bulletins/3fc00d6) would allow the federal government more power to weigh economic impact against habitat designations, remove safeguards against future events – including the impacts from the climate crisis – and rescind the “blanket rule” that automatically grants threatened species the same protections as those designated as endangered.

Republicans have controlled Tennessee’s seventh congressional district for four decades. The party finished about 21 points ahead of the Democrats when the seat was last contested, alongside [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump)’s victory in the presidential election last November.

Twelve months on, that lead has narrowed dramatically, according to opinion polls – and a challenger is attempting to build a “coalition of the pissed off” to overturn it altogether.

Senior White House officials have discussed internally their preference for Paramount Skydance to acquire Warner Bros Discovery in recent weeks, and one official has discussed potential programming changes at CNN with Larry Ellison, the largest shareholder of Paramount.

The discussions, according to people familiar with the matter, come as Paramount portrays itself as the best bid for Warner Bros Discovery, after the company announced last month it was open to offers, because it would have an easier time getting through regulatory review.

Federal prosecutors on Wednesday [said](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/11/19/comey-trump-abuse-power-hearing/) they had never presented the final version of the indictment filed against [James Comey](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/james-comey) to a full federal grand jury, a concession that adds to mounting challenges in their effort to prosecute the former FBI director.

Prosecutors acknowledged the omission during a Wednesday hearing in which Comey’s lawyers argued the case against him should be dismissed because it was a selective and vindictive prosecution.

A fourth person following the matter also said the administration was taking a more cautious approach to avoid provoking China. The discussions have not been previously reported.

The Senate has unanimously agreed to swiftly pass the bill, which would then head to the White House for Donald Trump’s signature.

Major League Soccer announced on Wednesday that it is re-opening its investigation into Philadelphia Union sporting director Ernst Tanner. The Union said in a statement to the Guardian that they have placed Tanner on administrative leave. The move comes a day after the Guardian published [an investigation into Tanner’s conduct](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/nov/18/philadelphia-union-ernst-tanner-mls-investigation).

Tanner had previously been under investigation by MLS after the league received a complaint from the MLS Players Association in late January. In it, the MLSPA outlined a wide range of alleged issues surrounding Tanner, which included the use of racist, sexist and homophobic language and instances of inappropriate physical contact with a staff member.

Made multiple misogynistic comments, including saying “women don’t belong in men’s soccer” about a female MLS referee and telling a gathering of academy players that they “should never worry about a referee, unless she’s a woman.”

Directed a homophobic slur at an MLS referee in 2023

Spoke about Black players “like they were subhuman” and suggested that Black referees “lack intelligence and capability.”

Touched a co-worker inappropriately “numerous times,” an allegation for which he was reported to the Union’s HR department.

Hired an underqualified coach who was allegedly abusive toward players on the Philadelphia Union II, the club’s reserve team that is used as a proving ground for young players from its thriving academy.

The Senate approved legislation on Wednesday that would force the release of investigative files related to the late pedophile [Jeffrey Epstein](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein), the morning after a near-unanimous vote in the [US House](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/house-of-representatives).

By unanimous consent, the Senate agreed to pass the measure as soon as it arrived in the chamber from the House on Tuesday, which had overwhelmingly approved the bill earlier that day in a 427-1 tally. Once the legislation is forwarded to the Senate, it will be automatically approved and cleared for Trump’s signature. The president, who dropped his opposition after it was clear it would pass, has said he would sign it.

An owl found partially encased in concrete after it got inside a cement mixer in south-western Utah is expected to fly free again after it was painstakingly cleaned by animal sanctuary workers who described the bird as a “fighter”.

Good morning.

The Senate moved swiftly yesterday [to approve legislation](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/18/house-vote-epstein-documents) that would force the release of investigative files related to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, hours after a near-unanimous vote in the House, almost wrapping up a bipartisan effort Donald Trump had fought for months.

**How did we get here?** The Epstein case returned dramatically to the public eye in July, when the justice department and FBI [released a memo](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/07/jeffrey-epstein-suicide-justice-department-fbi-review-confirms) saying they had nothing further to disclose about the investigation. That contradicted statements that the administration would release more information about Epstein in office.

**Why has Trump been unable to escape this** **case?** The Epstein scandal is a core issue for a swathe of Trump’s rightwing base, some of whom believe in conspiracy theories that surround Epstein and his coterie of powerful friends. Unlike many other issues, the Epstein files have prompted rebellions from Trump’s supporters.

      <source:markdown>Trump administration proposal would exclude elite schools that use diversity, equity and inclusion hiring practices

The state department is proposing to suspend 38 universities including Harvard and Yale from a federal research partnership program because they engage in diversity, equity and inclusion hiring practices, according to an internal memo and spreadsheet obtained by the Guardian.

The memo, dated 17 November, recommends excluding institutions from the Diplomacy Lab – a program that pairs university researchers with state department policy offices – if they “openly engage in DEI hiring practices” or set DEI objectives for candidate pools.

More than 97% of immigrants detained in the Trump administration’s “Operation Midway Blitz” in Chicago had no criminal conviction, according to federal court records.

The data, released on Friday and [first reported by the Chicago Tribune](https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/11/14/only-2-5-on-list-of-614-operation-midway-blitz-arrestees-had-criminal-histories-doj-records-show/?clearUserState=true), sharply contradicts the Trump administration’s portrayal of the immigration sweeps as an effort to fight crime and, as Trump himself has described it, targeting the “worst of the worst”.

      <source:markdown>China recently came out with its latest five-year plan for growth, which will guide the world’s second largest economy through 2030. In it, top Communist Party leaders have pushed to boost the country&#39;s strength in manufacturing to the next level by upgrading older factories with advanced technologies for automation.

The challenge, according to the Chinese ministry of education, is that the sector has tens of millions of open jobs because there aren&#39;t enough skilled workers in the labor force to fill them.

One school is trying to bridge that gap. Marketplace China correspondent Jennifer Pak visited it in Nanjing city.</source:markdown>

On Tuesday, the Guardian published an investigation into allegations against Philadelphia Union sporting director Ernst Tanner. The story reveals that, since his arrival at the Union in 2018, Tanner’s considerable success has come with multiple allegations of misbehavior, including alleged racist, sexist and homophobic commentary toward referees and opposition players, and an allegation of unwanted touching of a Union employee that was escalated to HR.

The bulk of the allegations the Guardian is reporting on are contained in a complaint filed by the MLS Players’ Association (MLSPA) to the league. The league launched its own investigation in January which recently concluded, having not corroborated the allegations.

Responded to a referee making contact with an opposition player by saying “why don’t you kiss him, you faggot” in a manner that could be heard by nearby fans.

Made multiple misogynistic comments, including saying “women don’t belong in men’s soccer” about a female MLS referee and telling a gathering of academy players that they “should never worry about a referee, unless she’s a woman.”

Spoke about Black players “like they were subhuman” and suggested that Black referees “lack intelligence and capability.”

Touched a co-worker inappropriately “numerous times,” an allegation for which he was reported to the Union’s HR department.

Hired an underqualified coach who was allegedly abusive toward players on the Philadelphia Union II, the club’s reserve team that is used as a proving ground for young players from its thriving academy.

The archdiocese of New Orleans has begun a three-week confirmation trial that will determine whether a federal bankruptcy judge signs off on a $230m settlement meant to compensate 650 clergy abuse survivors and resolve one of the US’s longest-running and costliest church bankruptcies.

US bankruptcy judge Meredith Grabill will decide whether the plan – five and a half years in the making – is fair to the survivors and dozens of other creditors who have waited through repeated delays, contentious negotiations and a protracted legal fight over a 2021 state law giving survivors of decades-old child sexual abuse the right to sue.

“It is the city of Raleigh’s understanding that the border patrol and ICE are already in Raleigh,” said the mayor, Janet Cowell, to local media, though she added city authorities did not know how many agents would be involved in the surge.

Last summer, a wildlife photographer saw, or believed he saw, a mountain lion in South Burlington, Vermont. While it’s possible, it is also remarkable: the apex predator was rendered extinct in northern New England in 1881 and the nearest confirmed breeding population is in North Dakota, 2,000 miles away.

But there could be in years hence more definitive sightings if Mighty Earth, a US-headquartered rewilding organization, convinces state and local authorities, along with Vermonters in general, that returning the top-level predator – known in various regions as the cougar, puma, panther and, in the north-east, catamount – to the region.

Good morning.

Violence has [increased across the occupied West Bank](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/18/west-bank-surge-settler-violence-israel-palestine) as Palestinian farmers try to harvest their olive trees before the end of the season, in the face of a campaign of harassment by groups of armed and aggressive Israeli settlers.

**How many attacks were there last month?** The UN logged more than 260 attacks resulting in Palestinian casualties or damage to property in the West Bank in October alone – the highest monthly count since they began monitoring in 2006.

**What’s the latest on the Gaza peace plan?** Yesterday, the UN security council [endorsed proposals](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/18/un-security-council-votes-to-endorse-donald-trumps-gaza-plan) put forward by Donald Trump for a lasting peace in Gaza, including the deployment of an international stabilization force and a possible path to a sovereign Palestinian state.

Donald Trump is to welcome Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, Mohammed bin Salman to Washington on Tuesday, in a red-carpet visit expected to result in the sale of highly advanced US F-35 fighter jets to the Gulf monarchy.

The crown prince’s arrival in Washington will be his first White House visit since the 2018 killing of the Washington Post journalist and critic of the kingdom Jamal Khashoggi. The CIA [later determined](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/26/jamal-khashoggi-mohammed-bin-salman-us-report) Khashoggi’s murder was approved by the crown prince, leading to global condemnation.

I listened to a passionate sista named Kathy Ade, the president of Syracuse’s student African-American Society.

      <source:markdown>The Maga base rallied on inflation and racial grievances, but stressing race over the economy is costing the US president

[Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump)’s 2024 campaign strategy leaned heavily on two sources of grievance among the Maga base. The first was the rising cost of living, propelled by the sharp burst of [inflation](https://www.theguardian.com/business/inflation) that peaked at 9% a year in July 2022. Though inflation had receded to 2.7% by election day, frustration over prices convinced many voters that Trump would be a superior steward of the economy. The other theme was race.

The strategy won the presidency. Then Trump made a mistake: focusing relentlessly on hostility towards immigrants and the diverse citizens of urban America, the president pretty much ignored – nay, worsened – his supporters’ economic woes.

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Shipped out of Dallas and dropped into Hollywood, Dončić has responded with a leaner body, a louder voice and a growing command of the Lakers’ post-LeBron future</p><p>It’s been nine and a half months since the trade that rocked the sports world <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/feb/02/anthony-davis-luka-doncic-trade-mavericks-lakers-nba-basketball">was broken via a Shams Charania tweet</a>. It was such a shock that the majority of his followers assumed he’d been hacked. Fresh off of a trip to the NBA finals, the young Slovenian superstar Luka Dončić was shipped off in the middle of the night to the Los Angeles Lakers for Anthony Davis, and the NBA as we know it was changed for ever. The fallout from one of the most shocking trades in sports history is still evolving: disgraced Mavericks general manager Nico Harrison, who spearheaded the transaction, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/nov/11/dallas-mavericks-fire-nico-harrison-luka-doncic-trade">was let go by the team last week</a>, in a move Mavericks fans have been <a href="https://www.keranews.org/news/2025-02-08/hundreds-of-dallas-mavericks-fans-protest-luka-doncic-trade-to-lakers">loudly clamoring for</a> since news broke that their homegrown franchise player was being abruptly cast out to sea. But on the other side of the coin was a mixed blessing and a new beginning: Dončić, who had imagined spending his entire career in Dallas like his mentor Dirk Nowitzki, suddenly found himself recast as the face of the NBA’s most famous franchise under the bright lights of Hollywood.

      <source:markdown>Shipped out of Dallas and dropped into Hollywood, Dončić has responded with a leaner body, a louder voice and a growing command of the Lakers’ post-LeBron future

It’s been nine and a half months since the trade that rocked the sports world [was broken via a Shams Charania tweet](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/feb/02/anthony-davis-luka-doncic-trade-mavericks-lakers-nba-basketball). It was such a shock that the majority of his followers assumed he’d been hacked. Fresh off of a trip to the NBA finals, the young Slovenian superstar Luka Dončić was shipped off in the middle of the night to the Los Angeles Lakers for Anthony Davis, and the NBA as we know it was changed for ever. The fallout from one of the most shocking trades in sports history is still evolving: disgraced Mavericks general manager Nico Harrison, who spearheaded the transaction, [was let go by the team last week](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/nov/11/dallas-mavericks-fire-nico-harrison-luka-doncic-trade), in a move Mavericks fans have been [loudly clamoring for](https://www.keranews.org/news/2025-02-08/hundreds-of-dallas-mavericks-fans-protest-luka-doncic-trade-to-lakers) since news broke that their homegrown franchise player was being abruptly cast out to sea. But on the other side of the coin was a mixed blessing and a new beginning: Dončić, who had imagined spending his entire career in Dallas like his mentor Dirk Nowitzki, suddenly found himself recast as the face of the NBA’s most famous franchise under the bright lights of Hollywood. And, as it turns out, the future is now.

While Dončić’s breakup with the Mavericks was both [very public and very messy](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/feb/27/luka-doncic-anthony-davis-trade-fallout-human-element) (the Mavs were not shy about vocalizing their reasoning for the move, and painting the 26-year-old in an unflattering light in the process), the silver linings showed themselves quickly.

The unsurprising confirmation of “a colossal global showdown” [between Jake Paul and Anthony Joshua](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/nov/12/anthony-joshua-jake-paul-december-miami-fight-netflix) arrived on Monday morning with a dull thud. That grand description of an eight-round scrap between a former YouTuber and a former world heavyweight champion was supplied by Paul’s company, Most Valuable Promotions, which also announced that the contest will be screened live on Netflix on 19 December and called Judgment Day.

Boxing operates in a netherworld that appears to have sunk far beyond any fear of judgment, while Paul has always had delusions of grandeur as a novice pro. But even boxing may have to consider its own culpability should Paul be badly hurt and end up in hospital after this fully sanctioned bout with regulation 10oz gloves is held in Miami.

Good morning.

Donald Trump has urged his fellow Republicans in Congress to vote for the release of files related to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, [reversing his previous resistance to such a move](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/17/trump-tells-republicans-to-vote-to-release-epstein-files-saying-we-have-nothing-to-hide).

**Why the sudden U-turn?** The House was expected to vote to release the files anyway, as early as tomorrow. There has been fervent suspicion within Trump’s usually loyal Maga base that the administration is hiding details of Epstein’s crimes to protect the rich elite with whom the financier associated – including Trump.

**Has Trump made up with Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has been calling for the files to be released?** No, he [doubled down on his attacks](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/nov/17/donald-trump-jeffrey-epstein-files-republicans-democrats-world-cup-us-politics-live-news-updates) against the Republican lawmaker, despite his reversal on resisting the release of the Epstein files. Greene, meanwhile, has said [she hopes they can make it up](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/16/marjorie-taylor-greene-trump-remarks).

**What does Israel’s limited data tell us about the rate of detainee casualties?** Israeli authorities only provided comprehensive data for the first eight months of the war. During this period, official figures show an unprecedented casualty rate among Palestinian detainees, on average one death every four days.

For our podcast &#34;How We Survive,&#34; Marketplace&#39;s Amy Scott visits a lab at Columbia University where researchers are figuring out how to make a more convincing and enjoyable fake meat.</source:markdown>

Greene, a longtime ally and fierce defender of Trump and the “Make America great again” (Maga) base, pushed back against his name-calling in her first interview since Trump [withdrew](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/14/trump-marjorie-taylor-greene-support) his support for her on Friday.

      <source:markdown>Reports that fire crews were ordered to leave original site of blaze prompt tough questions for city and LAFD leaders

Concerns over a small brush fire that reignited days later into the mammoth Palisades fire – the [most destructive](https://www.wildfirela.org/history/) in Los Angeles history – have grown in recent weeks amid reports that firefighters were ordered to leave the original site of the smaller blaze despite their concerns the ground was still smoldering.

Now, questions remain about how leaders at the Los Angeles fire department responded to a fire that [leveled entire communities](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/09/california-wildfires-pacific-palisades-los-angeles), and who within the agency knew about concerns the fire could still pose a threat. A former LA city councilor says the aftermath and recovery effort should serve as a Pearl Harbor moment for the city, which should never again be in a position with flames encroaching on all sides.

      <source:markdown>Experts say air traffic controllers quickly returning to work, with promise of full back pay, and even $10,000 bonus

Fears that it would take weeks or even months for flight schedules in the US to return to normal in the wake of the US federal government shutdown do not appear to be coming true and the busy upcoming holiday season should be normal for travel, experts say.

That is at least in part because air traffic controllers are quickly returning to work, according to the Department of Transportation.

Gail Etienne still remembers her first day at McDonogh 19 elementary school in New Orleans’ Lower Ninth Ward. As her family pulled up to the school in the car with the federal marshals, they saw crowds of angry people screaming. Some carried garbage cans and sticks.

      <source:markdown>Seemingly identical signatures appeared on clemency orders, which White House blamed on technical error

The Trump administration’s clemency drive is coming under scrutiny after the justice department this week replaced pardons posted online that bore strikingly similar copies of Trump’s signature with others that are distinctively variable.

The corrections came after online commenters seized on the similarities in the president’s signature granting “full and unconditional” pardons to seven men, including to former New York Mets player [Darryl Strawberry](https://apnews.com/television-fc6318ff6f3d4133890956a7576999e6), former Tennessee House speaker Glen Casada and former New York police sergeant Michael McMahon, on 7 November.

US district judge Rita Lin in San Francisco issued a preliminary injunction barring the administration from cancelling funding to the university based on alleged discrimination without giving notice to affected faculty and conducting a hearing, among other requirements.

Donald Trump has said he still plans to sue the BBC despite receiving the apology he demanded over a misleading edit of one of his speeches.

The row, over an episode of Panorama from last year about the Capitol riot in 2021, led to accusations of bias at the broadcaster and [the resignation](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/nov/09/tim-davie-expected-to-resign-bbc-director-general) of two of the most senior executives at the BBC: the director general, Tim Davie; and Deborah Turness, the chief executive of news.

      <source:markdown>Marine Mammal Center in Morro Bay and local harbor patrol teamed up for mission to reunite pup with its mother

It was a foggy October afternoon on the central California coast when the Marine Mammal Center got a call on their public hotline: there were distressed cries coming from the frigid waters in Morro Bay.

Good morning.

The convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein apparently served as [a behind-the-scenes adviser to the former Trump official and Maga influencer Steve Bannon](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/14/jeffrey-epstein-steve-bannon) during an August 2018 media campaign to defend Trump and his agenda, and to promote Bannon’s media ventures.

**What else has been released in the flood of recent Epstein emails?** Among many, many other things, one email shows an exchange between him and an associate in which they discuss “girls” and travel. The justice department continues to downplay the possibility that other men were involved in Epstein’s abuse of teen girls.

**What’s happening with** **rest of the Epstein files?** Trump is facing the prospect of a politically damaging congressional vote to release the files, after attempts to press two members of Congress to withdraw their backing for it appeared to have failed.

**What exactly is climate finance? Who pays it? And who gets it?** Sixteen years ago, at the climate summit in Copenhagen, rich and polluting countries pledged to provide $100bn (£76bn) each year by 2020 [so that poorer countries could cut their emissions and adapt to a hotter world](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/nov/14/what-exactly-is-climate-finance-who-pays-it-and-who-gets-it).

As the Trump administration and Texas’s governor, Greg Abbott, restrict free speech on college campuses, two professors at the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD) are suing the university for retaliation stemming from 2024 arrests at a peaceful campus protest.

History professors Ben Wright and Rosemary Admiral argue they should not have been arrested in the first place at the 1 May 2024 demonstration, where they were standing between their students and heavily armed law enforcement.

      <source:markdown>Claim, by election deniers, would signal latest step by DoJ in moving away from protecting Americans’ voting rights

Members of Georgia’s election denial movement have claimed in recent weeks that the justice department is investigating debunked fraud claims in the state stemming from the 2020 election.

The development would be just the latest in a series of moves by Trump acolytes at the Department of Justice who are transforming the voting section of the agency from an office focused on protecting Americans’ voting rights to one that is in lockstep with an election denial movement that incessantly demands investigations and drastic reductions in access to the polls based on [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump)’s lies about elections.

The head of an antisemitism watchdog has come out against the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) and other groups for their “divisive, hyperbolic and aggressive response” to Zohran Mamdani’s election, warning that a combative stance towards the New York City mayor-elect is a gift to the far right.

“The instrumentalizers of antisemitism are cheering on the divisions being created in New York City, because that’s their goal: divide people, divide Jews from each other,” said Jonathan Jacoby, the director of the Nexus Project, which works to combat antisemitism and its political abuse.

The convicted sex offender [Jeffrey Epstein](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein) apparently served as a behind-the-scenes adviser to the former Trump official and Maga influencer [Steve Bannon](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/steve-bannon) during an August 2018 media campaign to defend Trump and his agenda, and to promote Bannon’s media ventures.

Text messages released by the House oversight committee on Wednesday detail a six-day exchange between the men from 17 to 23 August, and show Epstein coaching Bannon on television appearances and political messaging.

His call-in appearance on Tuesday’s program to mark Veterans Day was meant to be a major coup for ESPN, the first time Trump had been interviewed on the network as a sitting president. But viewers could have just as easily been mistaken into believing they were watching Fox News.</p><p>Trump took his usual shots at Joe Biden, claimed credit for the Department for Veteran Affairs’ high approval ratings and declared victory over the Democrats in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/13/government-shutdown-timeline">a government shut down</a> that dragged on for a depressing 43 days. Rather than push back against the political self-promotion, McAfee cheered Trump on before opening the floor to his lackeys to ask him which NFL coach would make a great president. It was all delivered live from South Carolina’s Parris Island, the US’s oldest Marine depot, which gave McAfee further excuse to goad the commander-in-chief into barking “oorah” – a Marine battle cry that the recruits present were duty bound to respond to in kind.

“What happened to the Redskins, by the way?” Donald Trump asked in [an interview on the Pat McAfee Show](https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/Articles/2025/11/12/mcafee-defends-trump-interview-amid-backlash-over-veterans-day-appearance/) that notably did not stick to sports. His call-in appearance on Tuesday’s program to mark Veterans Day was meant to be a major coup for ESPN, the first time Trump had been interviewed on the network as a sitting president. But viewers could have just as easily been mistaken into believing they were watching Fox News.

Trump took his usual shots at Joe Biden, claimed credit for the Department for Veteran Affairs’ high approval ratings and declared victory over the Democrats in [a government shut down](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/13/government-shutdown-timeline) that dragged on for a depressing 43 days. Rather than push back against the political self-promotion, McAfee cheered Trump on before opening the floor to his lackeys to ask him which NFL coach would make a great president. It was all delivered live from South Carolina’s Parris Island, the US’s oldest Marine depot, which gave McAfee further excuse to goad the commander-in-chief into barking “oorah” – a Marine battle cry that the recruits present were duty bound to respond to in kind. The only thing missing from the jingoistic scene was a monument to ESPN’s fallen integrity.

      <source:markdown>This week we learned the Japanese investment firm Softbank sold all of its stake in the juggernaut chipmaker Nvidia. We&#39;ll get into why on today&#39;s “Marketplace Tech Bytes: Week in Review.” Plus, Apple is reportedly pushing back the release of its thinnest iPhone, the Air, and Wikipedia is asking AI companies, once again, to pay for scraping its data.

But first, back to that big move by Softbank and its CEO, Masayoshi Son. It cashed out its stake in Nvidia in October, the same month that the chipmaker hit a $5 trillion valuation. The $5.8 billion it netted will be redirected to OpenAI, part of a promised $30 billion to be invested in the maker of ChatGPT.

Marketplace’s Meghan McCarty Carino spoke with Anita Ramaswamy, columnist at The Information, about what all this means.

Some 79% of Democrats said they would regret it if they didn’t vote in the election, compared to 68% of Republicans.

      <source:markdown>Attempts to persuade two female members of Congress to withdraw backing for petition appear to have failed – key US politics stories from Thursday 13 November at a glance

[Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump) is facing the prospect of a politically damaging congressional vote on releasing the [Jeffrey Epstein](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein) files after attempts to press two female members of Congress to withdraw their backing for it appeared to have failed.

The reported refusal of Lauren Boebert, a Republican representative from Colorado, and Nancy Mace, from South Carolina, to remove their names from a discharge petition to force a vote leaves Trump exposed on an issue that carries the possibility of turning segments of his Maga base against him.

      <source:markdown>Move escalates legal battle over a redistricting effort designed to help Democrats flip House seats in 2026

The justice department on Thursday [joined a lawsuit](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-governor-gavin-newsom-californias-race-based-redistricting-plan) brought by California Republicans to block the state’s new congressional map, escalating a legal battle over a redistricting effort designed to give Democrats a better chance of retaking the House of Representatives next year.

The lawsuit, filed in federal court in California, challenges the congressional map championed by Gavin Newsom, the state’s Democratic governor, in response to a Republican gerrymander in Texas, sought by Donald Trump. The [justice department’s intervention](https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025-11-13-United-States-complaint-in-intervention.pdf) in the case sets up a high-profile showdown between the Trump administration and Newsom, one of the president’s chief antagonists and a possible 2028 contender.

For 16 of his last 21 years in prison, following his conviction for the murder of 19-year-old Ronnie Wipf, he has been confined, often alone, to a series of windowless concrete cells in the state penitentiary in McAlester, Oklahoma, in an underground block that prisoners have compared to a tomb.

Stephanie Shah kept her eyes on the winding road as rain streaked across the windshield. Her husband, Binod Shah, sat in silence beside her, staring out the window. It was late evening in Washington state on 23 March, and they had been driving all day, trading shifts, barely speaking, while their nine-month-old son dozed beneath a blanket in the backseat.

When the baby started to cry, Stephanie pulled over and together they changed his diaper, working without words. Then Binod leaned down, kissed his son’s forehead, and began to cry.

      <source:markdown>Kentucky trio oppose provision restricting hemp-derived products, with House to vote on Wednesday on funding bill

A last-minute provision in the federal spending bill heavily restricting hemp-derived products such as CBD and THC drinks could lead some Republicans to vote against the spending bill which, if passed, could end the government shutdown as early as Wednesday.

Kentucky is one of the largest producers of hemp in the country, and Republicans in the state have shown strong support for the hemp industry. Jonathan Miller, an advocate for the hemp industry and former Kentucky state treasurer, said that “Kentucky is really ground zero for the rebirth of hemp” – a niche industry until the 2018 farm bill allowed a much wider variety of legal products.

      <source:markdown>Government argues funding mechanism behind Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is unlawful

The Trump administration has launched its most direct attempt yet to shut down the top US consumer watchdog, arguing the current funding mechanism behind the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is unlawful.

Attorneys for the administration claimed in a [court filing](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69821739/01208794293/national-treasury-employees-union-v-russell-vought/) that the agency “anticipates exhausting its currently available funds in early 2026”, setting the stage for it to be dismantled.

      <title>Carlos Alcaraz battles back to beat Taylor Fritz: ATP Finals tennis – as it happened</title>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Taylor Fritz did all he could, but it still wasn’t enough to beat Carlos Alcaraz, who recovered after losing the first set to win an epic in three</p><p><strong>*Alcaraz 1-1 Fritz </strong>The last thing Fritz will want is for Alcraraz to rush through an easy hold and he makes 0-15, then attacks a second serve with a backhand down the line, as we suggested he should, for 0-30. And, though Alcaraz halves his arrears, Faritz runs around his forehand to clout down the line, raising two break points; the first disappears with an overhit forehand, the second with a service winner. Up advantage, though, Alcaraz errs, and this is already ridiculously enjoyable, Fritz taking control of the next rally by landing a forehand on to the baseline and seeing it home with backhands down the line to earn a third break point. And this time he looks ready to take it, racing to net when a drop sits up … but Alcaraz reads him and puts away the volley! The anticipation there was spooky, and there’s something about watching him play that’s almost wrong, stuff that shouldn’t be possible happening with such regularity it feels unreal, or staged. And that’s exactly the next point, a no-look drop, discharged with Fritz expecting a booming cross-court shot, followed up with a perfectly disguised and perfect lob; from there, Alcaraz sees out the hold, and these two games have been of absurdly high standard.</p><p><strong>Alcaraz 0-1 Fritz* (denotes server) </strong>A forehand clouted wide gives Alcaraz 0-15 … but that’s nothing a service winner can’t solve. At 30-15, though, a tame forehand into the net puts him under immediate pressure … but that’s nothing an ace can’t serve. He quickly makes 40-30, too, but a backhand winner sizzles past him cross, and another netted forehand means Alcaraz has advantage. Fritz looks nervous, reflecting how well he knows he’s playing: this is is his time.

      <source:markdown>Taylor Fritz did all he could, but it still wasn’t enough to beat Carlos Alcaraz, who recovered after losing the first set to win an epic in three

**\*Alcaraz 1-1 Fritz** The last thing Fritz will want is for Alcraraz to rush through an easy hold and he makes 0-15, then attacks a second serve with a backhand down the line, as we suggested he should, for 0-30. And, though Alcaraz halves his arrears, Faritz runs around his forehand to clout down the line, raising two break points; the first disappears with an overhit forehand, the second with a service winner. Up advantage, though, Alcaraz errs, and this is already ridiculously enjoyable, Fritz taking control of the next rally by landing a forehand on to the baseline and seeing it home with backhands down the line to earn a third break point. And this time he looks ready to take it, racing to net when a drop sits up … but Alcaraz reads him and puts away the volley! The anticipation there was spooky, and there’s something about watching him play that’s almost wrong, stuff that shouldn’t be possible happening with such regularity it feels unreal, or staged. And that’s exactly the next point, a no-look drop, discharged with Fritz expecting a booming cross-court shot, followed up with a perfectly disguised and perfect lob; from there, Alcaraz sees out the hold, and these two games have been of absurdly high standard.

**Alcaraz 0-1 Fritz\* (denotes server)** A forehand clouted wide gives Alcaraz 0-15 … but that’s nothing a service winner can’t solve. At 30-15, though, a tame forehand into the net puts him under immediate pressure … but that’s nothing an ace can’t serve. He quickly makes 40-30, too, but a backhand winner sizzles past him cross, and another netted forehand means Alcaraz has advantage. Fritz looks nervous, reflecting how well he knows he’s playing: this is is his time. He saves break point with a forehand winner, but is soon down advantage again, totally dominated in the next rally. Also again, though, he restores deuce, and this time an ace raises game point … only to be followed by a double. On the one hand, this isn’t the game Fritz had in mind when he opted to serve but, on the other, if he can see out the tension and hold, it’ll fortify him with confidence. Meantime, though, an ace earns another advantage, but again, he can’t see it out; what a start to the match this is. AND HAVE A LOOK!

The Israeli embassy in Washington has been circulating a letter on Capitol Hill defending its nine-month detention of a 16-year-old US citizen in military prison as pressure mounts from senators and civil society groups who have called for his release.

The document, obtained by the Guardian, describes Israel’s allegations against Mohammed Ibrahim and the medical treatment he has allegedly received in prison. It does not mention his dramatic weight loss or the fact that his family has had virtually no contact with him since his arrest in February.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) does not plan to resume its “wild to mild” flu vaccination campaign, which was halted in the midst of the record-breaking flu season.

Good morning.

Donald Trump has threatened legal action against the BBC and [welcomed the resignations of two of its most senior figures](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/10/trump-bbc-legal-action) after a campaign against the UK’s public broadcaster peaked over the criticism that a 2024 documentary used a misleading edit of a Trump speech on the day of the January 6 insurrection.

**Why did the BBC’s director general and News CEO resign?** They did so after the rightwing Telegraph newspaper published a leaked internal report by a former BBC standards adviser alleging failings in the broadcaster’s coverage.

**What did the documentary show?** Trump’s speech was edited to put together two sentences that were actually 54 minutes apart, splicing him [telling supporters to walk to the US capitol](https://www.theguardian.com/media/video/2025/nov/10/side-by-side-comparison-of-bbc-edited-trump-speech-from-day-of-capitol-attack-with-original-video) and then to “fight like hell”.

**So Trump didn’t tell people to “fight”?** No, he absolutely did, many times. According to the January 6 select committee [report](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Final_Report_of_the_Select_Committee_to_Investigate_the_January_6th_Attack_on_the_United_States_Capitol), “he spent the next 50-or-so minutes amping up his crowd with lies about the election, attacking his own vice-president and Republican members of Congress, and [exhorting the crowd to fight](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/10/why-bbc-resignations-trump-speech-edit)”.

**Why is Trump doing this?** The development “is only the latest chapter in a campaign meant to keep media institutions that cover Trump on their toes,” writes the [Guardian US media correspondent, Jeremy Barr](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/11/trump-bbc-lawsuit-threat-media-attacks).

**What are the spyware companies?** Paragon Solutions, which makes a spyware called Graphite; and NSO Group, which the Biden administration had in 2021 accused of engaging in business “contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the US”. Paragon made a deal the Trump administration in September to provide services to immigration agents.

Turning Point USA, the influential rightwing college group founded by Charlie Kirk, has brought Kirk’s message to a campus with a long history of leftwing activism two months after his death.

An event at the University of California, Berkeley, on Monday evening marked the chaotic last stop of the American Comeback tour, which Kirk had just begun at the time of his death at Utah Valley University. In the aftermath of Kirk’s fatal shooting, the events have come to serve as memorials, with prominent conservative speakers, including JD Vance, highlighting the staggering impact the controversial rightwing influencer’s death has had on American politics.

      <source:markdown>Country is one of world’s most repressive and corrupt, raising concerns over rights abuses of those deported

The United States has sent $7.5m to the government of Equatorial Guinea, one of the world’s most repressive and corrupt regimes, to accept noncitizen deportees from the US to the West African nation, according to a leading congressional Democrat, current and former state department officials and public government data.

The money sent to Equatorial Guinea is the first taken from a fund apportioned by Congress to address international refugee crises – and sometimes to facilitate the resettlement of refugees in the US – that has instead been repurposed under the Trump administration to hasten their deportation.

Democrats are seething after news emerged on Sunday that eight members of their Senate caucus had collaborated with Republicans on crafting a compromise to end the longest government shutdown in US history, without winning any healthcare concessions that they had sought.

But one name is coming in for more opprobrium than any other: Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader who had led the Democrats’ weeks-long stand against reopening the government without an extension of tax credits that lower premiums for Affordable Care Act (ACA) health plans.

BBC Director General Tim Davie and Deborah Turness, head of BBC News, have resigned over accusations that the broadcaster has been biased in its coverage of US President Donald Trump, the war in Gaza, and transgender issues. The allegations followed a memo published by the Telegraph in which Michael Prescott, a former external adviser on editorial standards at the BBC, raised concerns over &quot;systemic&quot; bias in coverage. Prescott&apos;s primary criticism was aimed at what he says was the selective edit of a January 6, 2021 speech made by Trump to supporters, which aired in a BBC Panorama episode ahead of the 2024 US election. Some pundits have responded to the resignations with claims that the BBC is the target of a right-wing political campaign to dismantle the media organization.

      <source:markdown>Atlético Ottawa secured a Canadian Premier League final victory unlike any other amid a swirling blizzard, with one of their goals dubbed an &#39;icicle kick&#39; from the Mexican midfielder David Rodríguez.

Hosts Ottawa beat Cavalry FC 2-1 in extra-time in Sunday’s title decider in temperatures of -8C (17.6F) with snow so heavy that play was halted every 15 minutes to clear the lines on the pitch and goalkeepers using shovels to mark out their boxes.

The Senate on Sunday made significant progress towards ending the [longest US government shutdown in history](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-federal-government-shutdown-2025), narrowly advancing a compromise bill to reauthorize funding and undo the layoffs of some employees.

But the measure, which resulted from days of talks between a handful of Democratic and Republican senators, leaves out the healthcare subsidies that Democrats had demanded for weeks. Most Democratic senators rejected it, as did many of the party’s lawmakers in the House of Representatives, which will have to vote to approve it before the government can reopen.

Atlético Ottawa secured a Canadian Premier League final victory unlike any other, a snow-globe spectacle amid a swirling blizzard featuring what online media outlets dubbed an “icicle kick” from Mexican midfielder David Rodríguez.

Hosts Ottawa beat Cavalry FC 2-1 in extra-time win in Sunday’s title decider in temperatures of minus 8 degrees Celsius (46.4F) with snow so heavy that play was halted every 15 minutes to clear the lines, and goalkeepers used shovels to carve out their boxes.

Good morning.

The Senate has made significant progress towards ending the longest US government shutdown in history, [narrowly advancing a compromise bill](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/10/us-government-shutdown-update-senate-funding-bill) to reauthorize funding and undo the layoffs of some employees.

**What did the Democrats say about the bill?** “This healthcare crisis is so severe, so urgent, so devastating for families back home, that I cannot in good faith support this \[resolution\] that fails to address the healthcare crisis,” said Chuck Schumer, the Democratic majority leader.

**What has the IDF said in response?** In a written statement, the IDF said it “remains committed to the rule of law and continues to operate in accordance with its legal and ethical obligations, despite the unprecedented operational complexity posed by Hamas’s systematic embedding within civilian infrastructure and its use of civilian sites for military purposes”.

No league sells parity like the NFL: it’s the entire brand. But through 10 weeks of this season, this isn’t a league that is equally balanced between the good, the bad and the mediocre. It’s one where most of the league is simply _fine._

In the NFC, at least, there is some clarity. The Rams and Seahawks (both 7-2) look like the most complete teams in football, and secured blowout wins on Sunday. The 6-2 Eagles, despite their struggles, still have one of the most talented rosters in the league, likewise with the Packers (5-2-1). Even the Lions (6-3), who have been inconsistent along both lines of scrimmage and have been dealing with tension on their coaching staff, have proven they can hammer good teams.

The administrator for the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), Mehmet Oz, recently claimed that an audit revealed “more than $1bn of federal taxpayer dollars were being spent on funding Medicaid for illegal immigrants”, but experts say the audits were unrelated to immigration, and that rhetoric like this could make immigrant families – regardless of legal status – afraid to seek necessary medical care.

Leo Cuello, a research professor at Georgetown University’s Center for Children and Families, noted that he had not “seen what this audit is”, but “based on the reporting, it appears that it is related to administrative errors in state claiming for matching funds, which is a relatively common occurrence, and which CMS monitors closely as they should”.

I had accompanied her – my dear friend – to a recent doctor’s appointment. She is in her 70s, lives alone while navigating multiple chronic health issues, and has been getting short of breath climbing the front stairs to her apartment. In the exam room, she spoke slowly and self-consciously, the way people often do when they are trying to describe their bodies and anxieties to strangers.

The annual migration of hundreds of thousands of Canadian “snowbirds” escaping freezing temperatures in their homeland and heading to warmer US states such as Florida for the duration of the winter could be about to become noticeably thinner.

Many have ditched plans to visit their southern neighbor and are looking to spend their valuable dollars elsewhere, largely put off by Donald Trump’s [escalating economic war](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/25/trump-tariffs-canada-ronald-reagan) with Canada and [strict new immigration rules](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/13/canada-fingerprint-visit-us) that have created fear and confusion.

The California hunter who [spent](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/05/california-man-survived-wilderness) nearly three weeks stranded in the frosty, mountainous wilderness reportedly survived by rationing out the little food he brought with him – eating 70 or fewer calories daily for a stretch – as well as consuming melted snow to stay hydrated.

Yet before his 1 November rescue, 65-year-old Ron Dailey was so unsure whether anyone would save him that he tried to text his family regrets for possibly missing the rest of their lives – while assuring them that he would watch them “from heaven”.

      <source:markdown>Trump’s team flirts with weakening the dollar, threatening US influence, low borrowing costs and global stability

Magical thinking is indispensable to understanding Team Trump’s economic policymaking. The White House often seems to believe two opposing policies can work together while one policy can do two or three contradictory things.

A heavy dose of hocus pocus will be needed to make the administration’s dollar policy work in the interest of the United States, for it appears that they want to end the US dollar’s supremacy in global finance.

      <source:markdown>New York City mayor-elect refused to ‘be in the shadows’ in the face of Islamophobic attacks during his campaign

Across the country, Donald Trump’s crackdown on immigrants has shaken neighbourhoods, torn apart families and engendered a sense of panic among communities. But in New York, on Tuesday night, Zohran Mamdani, the first Muslim mayor of New York, and an immigrant from Uganda, chose to underline his identity. “New York will remain a city of immigrants: a city built by immigrants, powered by immigrants and, as of tonight, led by an immigrant,” he told an ecstatic crowd at Paramount theater in Brooklyn.

The son of a Muslim father and a Hindu mother, he was born in Kampala, raised in New York, and identifies as a democratic socialist. Almost every aspect of Mamdani’s identity had been an issue of contention during the election. Earlier this week, the Center for Study of Organized Hate published a report highlighting the surge in Islamophobic comments online between July and October, most of which labelled Mamdani as an extremist or terrorist.

James Dewey Watson, whose co-discovery of the twisted-ladder structure of DNA in 1953 helped light the long fuse on a revolution in medicine, crimefighting, genealogy and ethics, has died, according to his former research lab. He was 97.

The breakthrough – made when the brash, Chicago-born Watson was just 24 – turned him into a hallowed figure in the world of science for decades. But near the end of his life, he faced condemnation and professional censure for offensive remarks, including saying Black people were less intelligent than white people.

The NCAA revoked the eligibility of six men’s college basketball players for allegations of sports betting on Friday in three separate cases at New Orleans, Mississippi Valley and Arizona State.

The NCAA Committee on Infractions released findings from an investigation that concluded Cedquavious Hunter, Dyquavian Short, Jamond Vincent, Donovan Sanders, Alvin Stredic and Chatton ‘BJ’ Freeman manipulated their performances to lose games, not cover betting lines, ensure certain prop bets were reached or provided information that enabled others to do so during the 2024-25 regular season.

Freeman also knowingly provided information on at least two occasions to his then-girlfriend, who was also betting on Freeman.

[Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump) has pardoned the former [Tennessee](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/tennessee) state house speaker and a one-time aide of public corruption charges after the White House said the [Biden administration](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/biden-administration)’s justice department “significantly over-prosecuted” both for a minor issue.

Glen Casada, a former Republican state representative, was sentenced in September to three years in prison, and his former chief of staff, Cade Cothren, was also convicted and received a two-and-a-half-year prison sentence. The case centered on their actions after both had been driven from their leadership roles and were accused of running a scheme to win taxpayer-funded mail business from lawmakers.

      <source:markdown>Policy means ‘people will go hungry, food pantries will be overburdened’, says judge. Plus, Tesla shareholders approve $1tn pay package for Musk

Good morning.

A federal judge in Rhode Island [ordered the Trump administration](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/06/ruling-snap-benefits-funding-trump) yesterday to find the money to fully fund food stamps for 42 million low-income Americans in November by today, in a rebuke to the government’s plan to only provide reduced aid during the shutdown.

**What is the impact?** After the administration said on Monday it would [only half](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/03/trump-partially-fund-food-stamps-snap) fund the program, Linda Nageotte, of Feeding America, said: [“One in eight people in our country right now](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/06/snap-cuts-how-to-help) don’t have enough to eat.”

**What’s the shutdown latest?** It’s the longest in history, on to its 38th day. Lawmakers are in talks that could lead to a deal. But some Democratic legislators saw Tuesday’s electoral wins as evidence they should [hold the line](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/06/us-government-shutdown-day-37) to extract significant concessions.

**What** **details do we know** **?** The flight reductions, according to ABC News, will start at 4% on Friday and increase to 10%. Airports in cities including Atlanta, Denver, Dallas, Orlando, Miami, LA, San Francisco, New York, Houston and Chicago will be affected.

**What impact could the move** **have?** The cuts could represent as many as 1,800 flights and upwards of 268,000 seats combined, according to an estimate by the aviation analytics firm Cirium. They are likely to create a cascade of scheduling issues and delays at some of the country’s largest airports.

Stella Barey has an hour for lunch. At 1.30pm, she loads her banged-up Tacoma with her three Belgian malinois and drives to a secret Los Angeles hiking trail. There, she gulps down a tapioca pudding and laces up her sneakers. After checking over her shoulder for foot traffic, she pulls down her brown sweatpants and jiggles her bare ass for the camera. Then come the undies. Her coiffed landing strip hovers above the rocks as a rush of urine floods the trail. Every mile she walks, she films another video: a flash, a moon, a finger up the ass.

When Barey decided in 2020 to pursue porn full-time, she did not imagine that at 28 she would spend more time hunched over a desk – not in the fun way – making flow charts, scheduling Zoom calls, and sending pitch decks. “I’m at my happiest when I’m making a video like putting a strawberry in my butt and pushing it out,” she says. “Now I’m on calls all day and I have tech neck.” Known online as the “Anal Princess”, with large, blinking Shelley Duvall eyes and an American Girl doll pout, she will try anything once – even the title “tech founder”.

      <source:markdown>President jets in to speak at ritzy American Business Forum as millions see their food aid slashed – crisis, what crisis?

It was the week in which Republicans took a beating at the polls, the government shutdown became the longest in history, and [42 million people](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/03/trump-snap-benefits-reactions) across the country, including 3 million in Florida, saw their federal food aid slashed.

But in the alternative reality of Miami, where tickets to an overwhelmingly conservative business conference headlined by Donald Trump cost up to $1,990, and billionaires from Saudi Arabia rubbed shoulders with equally wealthy American tycoons such as Jeff Bezos and Ken Griffin, those events created barely a ripple.

Nancy Pelosi’s announcement that, after nearly four decades in Congress, she will not seek re-election has reignited interest in the race for her long-held San Francisco seat.

The retirement of the former speaker of the House was long-anticipated, and two Democrats had already declared their intent to run. Saikat Chakrabarti, a former tech executive who previously served as the chief of staff to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Scott Wiener, a state senator, kicked off their campaigns this year.

      <source:markdown>Bob Birarda, jailed in 2022 for assaulting players, is not listed by Canada Soccer or BC Soccer. The country’s new Safe Sport director says the omission exposes a major gap — and is calling for a global registry of banned coaches.

Two years after receiving an 18-month jail sentence for sexually assaulting players under his care, a former Canada women’s national team coach is yet to appear on any public sanctions list published by Canada Soccer or BC Soccer, the regional governing body for soccer in British Columbia, where the crimes took place.

The revelation has prompted the executive director of the Canadian organization newly appointed to manage reports of abuse and misconduct to call for an international registry of offenders to track individuals who have been banned from sports for misconduct.

The supreme court on Thursday allowed Donald Trump’s administration to enforce a policy blocking transgender and non-binary people from choosing passport sex markers that align with their gender identity.

The decision by the high court’s conservative majority is Trump’s latest win on the high court’s emergency docket, and it means his administration can enforce the policy while a lawsuit over it plays out. It halts a lower-court order requiring the government to keep letting people choose male, female or X on their passport to line up with their gender identity on new or renewed passports.

New York, Los Angeles and Chicago airports are among 40 that will see reductions in flights from Friday as a result of the [government shutdown](https://apnews.com/article/government-shutdown-longest-trump-republican-senators-democrats-9712df6c11ef19c5df8f18c8a4f7b341), according to a list distributed to the airlines.

The Associated Press published the list after airline regulators identified “high-volume markets” where air traffic will be reduced on Friday, a move that would force airlines to cancel thousands of flights and create a cascade of scheduling issues and delays at some of the nation’s largest airports.

This article was amended on 6 November 2025. A previous version said the US government was in its 35th day of shutdown. The correct current number is 37 days.

      <source:markdown>Focus shifts to other states where Trump is pushing for redrawn districts as parties race to seize midterm advantage

California voters [overwhelmingly approved](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/04/california-prop-50-voting-result) a redistricting referendum on Tuesday, a critical win for Democrats as they attempt to counter efforts by Donald Trump and allies to redraw congressional districts in their favor ahead of next year’s midterm elections. Now, the focus will shift to other states, where Trump is pressuring Republican-led legislatures to redraw their districts. Democrats are racing to do the same in an [all-out sprint to rejigger](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/nov/02/us-redistrcting-congressional-map) district lines ahead of next year’s midterms.

California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, and fellow Democrats placed the measure on the ballot this summer after Texas Republicans [passed a map](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/aug/01/texas-republicans-congressional-redistricting-trump) that would add anywhere from three to five Republican seats in Congress. The new California map neuters that effort by adding the same number of Democratic seats.

Published last week, the tech billionaire’s 17-page missive called for a “strategic pivot” away from focusing on slashing emissions and towards preventing poverty and suffering. It was quickly picked up by some on the right, including Donald Trump, who hailed it as a much-needed backpedaling on climate efforts.

Good morning.

There is [still a chance for the world to avoid](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/nov/05/still-a-chance-to-return-to-1-point-5c-climate-goal-researchers-say) the worst ravages of climate breakdown and return to the goal of 1.5C if governments take concerted action on greenhouse gas emissions, according to an assessment.

**How do things stand?** For the past two years, global temperatures have surpassed the [1.5C threshold above preindustrial levels](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jan/10/world-temperature-in-2024-exceeded-15c-for-first-time) set out in the 2015 Paris agreement. A UN Environment Programme report published this week said governments’ current plans would lead to devastating heating of about 2.3-2.5C.

**What has Brazil’s president said** **?** “This \[summit\] is an opportunity for politicians, diplomats, scientists, activists and journalists to witness … the true state of the forests, the planet’s largest river basin, and the millions of people who live in the region,” Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva [wrote for the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/06/brazil-cop-30-truth-world-leaders-climate-crisis-president-lula).

**What is the case about?** Trump has imposed tariffs via the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which in some circumstances grants the president authority to regulate or prohibit international transactions – but only during a national emergency.

**What happens if the court sides against the president?** It would force the White House to reconsider its aggressive tariff policy, which has strained global trade ties.

A federal investigator said a UPS cargo plane’s left wing caught fire and an engine fell off shortly before it crashed and exploded into a huge fireball in Louisville, Kentucky, on Tuesday night, killing at least nine people and injuring 11.

At least 28 National Transportation Safety Board agents arrived at the site and began searching for clues about the possible cause of the disaster, which saw the UPS plane [crash shortly after takeoff](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/04/louisville-plane-crash-airport-kentucky-latest) at the Louisville Muhammad Ali international airport, leaving behind a fiery trail of destruction on the ground and a huge plume of black smoke.

      <source:markdown>In today’s newsletter: With more than 50% of the vote, Mamdani tells supporters: “In this moment of political darkness, New York will be the light”

Good morning. A few hours ago, Zohran Mamdani was declared [the winner of the New York City mayoral election](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/04/zohran-mamdani-mayor-new-york-city) with more than 50% of the vote on the biggest turnout since the 1960s. A rank outsider when the race started, he will become the city’s first Muslim mayor and its youngest in more than 100 years. And as an avowed socialist who has emerged as a national symbol of opposition to Donald Trump, he has given progressive Democrats something they believe is worth fighting for.

It was a good night all over for Democrats, who won governorships [in Virginia](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/04/virginia-governor-abigail-spanberger) and [New Jersey](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/04/new-jersey-election-result-mikie-sherrill-wins-governor-race) and saw voters in California support [a redistricting plan](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/04/california-prop-50-voting-result) designed to counter Republican efforts to redraw the map to their advantage in red states. But Republicans believe Mamdani is a gift for them, too: in frequently racist attacks on his candidacy, they have tarred him as a “Jihadist”, a communist and claimed he represents a new extremity on the left.

_**NHS**_ \| An “ugly” racism reminiscent of the 1970s and 1980s has become worryingly commonplace again in modern Britain and NHS staff are bearing the brunt of it, [Wes Streeting has warned](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/nov/04/nhs-staff-face-ugly-racism-akin-to-the-70s-and-80s-says-wes-streeting). Racist abuse now happens so often that it has become “socially acceptable to be racist”, the health secretary said.

_**Productivity**_ \| Employers have been told in a landmark government review that fixing Britain’s health-related worklessness crisis [will require them to spend £6bn a year](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/nov/05/fixing-britains-worklessness-crisis-will-cost-employers-6bn-a-year-report-says). The report said that a drastic expansion in occupational health was needed to help prevent hundreds of thousands of people from falling out of the workforce.

_**US politics**_ \| Dick Cheney, the divisive US vice-president under George W Bush who helped lead the country into a disastrous invasion of Iraq, [has died](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/04/dick-cheney-vice-president-republican-bush-dies) aged 84.

Weeks before one of America’s best-known businessmen, [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump), was sworn in as president on an overcast day in Washington DC, a different politician with a similarly familiar name took her oath of office elsewhere in the Capitol.

Liz Cheney was then both a freshman congresswoman from Wyoming and a stalwart of the neoconservative philosophy espoused by her father Dick Cheney, the former vice-president under George W Bush who died on Monday. Trump had repudiated Bush’s invasion of Iraq in his campaign for president, but the congresswoman nonetheless went on to become an ally in bending Republican lawmakers to his will.

- [Dick Cheney, vice-president and giant of Republican politics, dies aged 84](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/04/dick-cheney-vice-president-republican-bush-dies)


Dick Cheney, [who has died aged 84](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/04/dick-cheney-vice-president-republican-bush-dies), came to be seen as a moderate in his later years for his staunch opposition to Donald Trump, but he also stands accused of paving the way for Trumpism by undermining the independence of the intelligence agencies and US adherence to international law.

As George W Bush’s second-in-command in the “war on terror” declared after the 9/11 attacks, Cheney made himself one of the most powerful vice-presidents in US history, and was a key protagonist in the push to invade Iraq, as well as the use of torture on suspected al-Qaida members detained without charge in the CIA’s offshore “black sites”.

      <source:markdown>‘I made a mistake’ says artist who included cloned archway on Halloween float for a Catholic school

A [Pennsylvania](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pennsylvania) artist’s efforts to create a Halloween float for a local Catholic school went awry when he inadvertently included a replica of the gateway arch from a Nazi concentration camp, prompting a hasty apology from the diocese of Harrisburg.

In apologizing for the fiasco, Galen Shelly [told PennLive](https://www.pennlive.com/news/2025/11/holocaust-imagery-on-halloween-parade-float-designer-apologizes-for-mistake.html) that a lighted archway and lanterns he ordered to decorate a parade float he was building for Hanover’s St Joseph’s school did not arrive in time – so he searched the internet for images of cemetery gates to represent the idea that “none of us get out of this life alive”.

      <source:markdown>The ballot measure win would be a significant political gain for the Golden state governor eyeing the White House

Gavin Newsom, the California governor, is [on the verge](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/02/california-prop-50-democrats-trump) of a political victory that, just a few months ago, didn’t exist.

      <source:markdown>President’s pressure on the department to prosecute his enemies is hurting US law and violating policies, say experts

Donald Trump’s intense pressure on the US Department of Justice (DoJ) to charge key foes with crimes based on dubious evidence and his ongoing investigations of other political enemies is hurting the rule of law in the US and violating departmental policies, which scholars and ex-prosecutors say may help scuttle some charges.

They also voice dismay about charges filed against ex-FBI director [James Comey](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/james-comey) and [Letitia James](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/letitia-james), the New York attorney general, by Lindsey Halligan, the ex-White House lawyer and novice prosecutor, who Trump installed in a key US attorney post after forcing out a veteran prosecutor who deemed the cases weak.

Good morning.

The Trump administration said it would provide only partial relief to recipients of food stamps on Monday, amid mounting uncertainty among the nearly 42 million people on the supplemental nutrition assistance program (Snap).

**How did we get here?** As a result of the shutdown, Donald Trump has threatened to cut off the food benefits for the first time in the program’s more than 60-year history. A federal judge last week prevented the Department of Agriculture from [suspending](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/31/judge-blocks-trump-snap-suspension) Snap altogether.

**What impact will it have?** There have already been long lines at food banks across the nation. Chris Stein [spoke to people](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/03/trump-snap-benefits-reactions) affected, with many saying they would have to scrimp on food to get by. “I’m dumbfounded by the cruelty,” one said.

**Can Trump even do that?** The president does not directly determine how much money any city receives from the federal government; appropriation is the constitutional function of Congress. But control over how money is spent – or withheld in acts of impoundment, which are forbidden under federal law – has become a point of [legal contention](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/03/trump-mamdani-new-york-election-mayor-cuomo).

**What do New York polls say?** A recent survey from [AtlasIntel](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/polls/nyc-mayoral-election-polls-2025.html) showed Mamdani, the Democratic nominee, on 44%, the independent Andrew Cuomo on 39% and the Republican Curtis Sliwa on 16%.

      <source:markdown>Veterans groups say recent Washington Post stories on VA disability payments paint a misleading picture. The paper stands by its reporting

In October, the [Washington Post](https://www.theguardian.com/media/washington-post) reported that it had uncovered “rampant exaggeration and fraud” in the US Department of Veterans Affairs’ disability benefits system.

“Military veterans are swamping the US government with dubious disability claims … exploiting the country’s sacred commitment to compensate those harmed in the line of duty,” the newspaper [reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/interactive/2025/veterans-affairs-disability-claims-fraud/).

      <source:markdown>With polls showing signs of recovery after a popularity slump, Tuesday’s results will test whether the party can regain voters’ trust

One year after [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump) won his way back into the White House, voters are going back to the ballot box in a test of the president’s popularity and whether Democrats are able to rebound from their catastrophic losses of 2024.

With governor’s mansions, mayoral offices, statehouses and mid-cycle redistricting on the line in closely watched contests from Trenton, New Jersey and Richmond, Virginia to New York City and beyond, the party is pinning its hopes on locally rooted campaigns aiming to blunt a national conservative message that has surged in recent years.

Andrew Wiggins was among the first superstar prospects of the social media era. Born in Thornhill, Ontario just north of Toronto, Wiggins was known internationally by the time he was 13. It wasn’t always easy for the shy, small-town kid to embrace the spotlight.

After just one full season at Vaughan, Wiggins needed better competition than Canada could provide and moved on to Huntington Prep in Huntington, West Virginia — a relatively new prep school set in a small, blue-collar, sports-oriented college town near Kansas.

      <source:markdown>Democratic leaders decry ‘unbelievably cruel’ move, saying ‘Trump is using food as a weapon’ during shutdown

Senate [Republicans](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans) shot down a Democratic-led attempt to fully fund Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap) benefits on Monday during the government shutdown – a move that heightens uncertainty for the 42 million Americans participating in the country’s biggest anti-hunger program.

Jeff Merkley, a Democratic senator, and Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader, attempted to pass a [resolution](https://www.merkley.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/Merkley-Schumer-SNAP-Resolution.pdf) via unanimous consent that would have forced the Department of Agriculture to fund Snap benefits for the month of November.

- [Trump administration will provide half of usual funds to Snap recipients in November](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/03/trump-partially-fund-food-stamps-snap)


Looking ahead, on Wednesday, **the supreme court will hear arguments on whether Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs on dozens of countries are legal.** It’s set to be one of the most consequential rulings on the expanse of Trump’s presidential power in his second term.

My colleague, **Eduardo Porter**, has this helpful breakdown on the question at the heart of this case. A dozen states have challenged the president’s contention that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) of 1977 gives him the power to impose tariffs on imports from every country in the world to defend the nation from a several “threats” facing the US.

Justices will focus much of their attention on whether IEEPA authorizes the president to [levy a tariff](https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/court-filings/state-of-oregon-et-al-v-donald-j-trump-united-states-department-of-homeland-security-et-al-complaint-2025.pdf) – a word that is not mentioned in the text of the law and is, moreover, a form of taxation, over which, per the constitution, Congress has exclusive power.

IEEPA [gives the president](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1701) authority “to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States, if the president declares a national emergency with respect to such threat”.

      <source:markdown>Platner’s populist campaign faces backlash over past comments and a contentious tattoo

      <source:markdown>Sam Bankman-Fried, founder and former CEO of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, is serving 25 years in federal prison for fraud. His company collapsed and went bankrupt in 2022. Investigators found that billions of dollars in customer funds had been borrowed without permission to help shore up Bankman-Fried’s other firm, Alameda Research.

But throughout the last three years, Bankman-Fried has maintained his innocence, and he&#39;s filed an appeal. A hearing is scheduled for Nov. 4.

The first time the Blue Jays won a World Series, in 1992, the team’s victory parade was held on the same day as a contentious national referendum. At play that day was a suite of potential constitutional changes that had Canadians, living through a period of economic strain, regional tension, and a growing distrust of political elites, questioning what kind of country they were living in. The referendum failed and paved the way for another, three years later, in 1995, that almost saw Quebec leave Canada altogether. Following the win, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney congratulated the Jays noting that, beyond it being a “historic victory” the team’s playoff run “united a nation behind you, capturing the imagination of Canadians from coast to coast.” It was something Canada needed.

This time there was no parade. The Jays lost 5-4 to the LA Dodgers in the early hours of Sunday in [a heartbreaking Game 7](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/nov/02/dodgers-win-world-series-game-7-blue-jays-baseball), missing out on their first World Series title in 32 years.

George Clooney has said he feels it was a “mistake” for Kamala Harris to replace Joe Biden in the 2024 US presidential election, adding that he had no regrets about the [New York Times opinion piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/10/opinion/joe-biden-democratic-nominee.html) in which he called on the Democrats to find a new presidential nominee.

[Speaking on CBS’ Sunday Morning](https://www.cbsnews.com/video/extended-interview-george-clooney/), the actor and activist, who is a prominent financial donor to the Democratic party, said he would write his op-ed again if given the chance, and that he wished the Democrats had held a new primary to elect a presidential candidate. Instead, Harris was nominated by a virtual vote of party delegates.

Normally, redistricting only occurs after the US census counts residents in each state every 10 years. A demand from Donald Trump to lock in more Republican-leaning districts in Congress, together with a changing legal landscape around partisan gerrymandering, set off a chain of mid-decade reapportionments.

      <source:markdown>- [Dodgers fight back to prevail 5-4 in 11 innings](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/nov/02/dodgers-win-world-series-game-7-blue-jays-baseball)

- Smith’s 11th-inning home run breaks deadlock

- LA clinch first repeat championship since 2000


**Dodgers 0-0 Blue Jays, end of first inning**

A bit of confusion here. Ohtani takes the mound a bit late and has yet to throw a warm-up pitch at the time the Blue Jays are ready to bat. The home-play umpire is giving him a little extra time.

George Springer takes three straight balls from Ohtani before taking a strike. The Toronto DH, back from an oblique injury, then rips a line drive to left field for a leadoff single. The crowd explodes.

Nathan Lukes goes down 1-2 in the count and fights off a few more pitches before striking out swinging on a splitter.

Vladimir Guerrero Jr works the count to 3-2, then takes a 100mph fastball right down the middle for a called strikeout ... before catcher Will Smith fires down to second to catch Springer stealing. The strikeout double play abruptly ends the inning. Both teams get leadoff hits in the first inning but neither can take advantage.

Ohtani takes two balls, fouls off a cutter, then singles to right-field off a changeup.

Will Smith grounds out to first base, making the first out but moving Ohtani into scoring position.

Freeman jumps on the first pitch and flies out to center for the second out, but Ohtani tags up and takes third.

Betts takes a ball, then grounds out to short to roars from the Rogers Centre crowd. It’s a scoreless first inning for Scherzer.

**Splendora** paid $7.80 to a $2 stake – a shade under 3-1.

**Hope Road** cruised through the race until the final turn and eased to the front just over a furlong out, but **Splendora** rocketed past soon afterwards and the race was as good as over.

      <source:markdown>Food insecurity for millions of Americans set to increase with Trump officials saying Snap benefits will cease as government shutdown enters second month

Waves of hungry Angelenos gathered outside Community Space food bank’s storefront on a recent afternoon, grabbing dry goods like pastries, bagels, lentils and pasta along with refrigerated salads and frozen bags of brisket.
