        <![CDATA[<p>The Russell 2000, a stock index of smaller companies or “small caps,” has fallen behind the S&amp;P 500 over the past few years. A Fed rate cut, which may come as soon as next week, could change their luck. In this episode, why interest rates have an outsize effect on smaller companies. Plus: Homebuilding is harder under President Trump’s tariffs and immigration policies, brands lean into the power of scent, and we recap the week’s economic headlines.</p><br/><p><em>Every story has an economic angle.

Today, we'll discuss what to make of how the Bureau of Labor Statistics collects data on jobs and inflation, as well as the doubts cast on BLS under the second Trump administration.

        <![CDATA[<p>A U.S. district court issued a preliminary injunction barring President Donald Trump from ousting Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook, which means she can stay in her job while she fights her dismissal. The central bank is largely supposed to be insulated from politicians. However, this is unlikely to be the final word on the matter. And later, consumers have choices for many services. Why is that not the case with electricity providers?</p>]]>

Although China’s overall export growth has slowed, it still rose 4.5% in August — thanks, in part, to strategic redirection to new markets. In this episode, what the U.S. stands to lose by cutting off China as a trade partner.

But there’s more under the central bank umbrella than president-appointed officials. In this episode, we break down why regional Fed banks and Fed presidents matter. Plus: The latest Beige book shows an uptick in lending, shipping costs are down and an economist walks us through her process for reading a CPI report.</p><br/><p><em>Every story has an economic angle.

Today, we'll look at what the illicit ant trade looks like and the sort of environmental and financial costs that can result from invasive species.

Then, Australia is hoping to ease the rare earths bottleneck after China said it's tightening controls on mining and processing.</p>]]>

Then, Evergrande — once one of China's biggest property developers — is having its shares delisted from Hong Kong's stock exchange. Its ruinous downfall has threatened to weigh down the world's second-largest economy.</p>]]>

Plus, it's the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in Scotland, showcasing drama, comedy, and music. The tourism provides an economic boost, but also makes things pricier. How are folks there dealing?</p>]]>
