      <source:markdown>- Williams back in ITIA pool for first time since 2022

- Move required before any potential competitive return

- Could be eligible to play again as early as mid-2026


Serena Williams has taken the procedural move required of any player contemplating a competitive comeback, after the 23-time grand slam singles champion re-entered the International Tennis Integrity Agency’s (ITIA) registered testing pool for the first time since 2022.

Williams, 44, has not played an official match since [her run to the third round of the US Open](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/sep/02/serena-williams-ajla-tomljanovi-us-open-tennis-third-round-retirement) more than three years ago.

[Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump) has ordered a “pause” on asylum claims after last week’s shooting of two national guard members in Washington.

The suspect in the shooting of two [West Virginia](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/west-virginia) national guard soldiers in [Washington DC](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/washington-dc) on the eve of Thanksgiving had been struggling with his mental health, sometimes spending “weeks on end” in isolation, as he struggled to assimilate in the years since arriving in the United States, it has emerged.

According to emails obtained by the Associated Press, Rahmanullah Lakanwal’s mental health had been unravelling for years, leaving him unable to hold a job and flipping between long, dark stretches of isolation and taking sudden weeks-long cross-country drives.

This striking allusion to Jeffrey Epstein, the well-connected financier who died in jail awaiting trial on sex-trafficking, came during day one of a potentially weeklong proceeding to weigh the legality of evidence gathered during Mangione’s arrest at a McDonald’s restaurant after the killing of a prominent healthcare executive.

The 49ers’ season felt over after [Week 6’s loss to Tampa Bay](https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401772749/49ers-buccaneers). Yes, they were 4-2. Yes, they were tied with the Seahawks and Rams and had already won head-to-head games against both. But that’s when they hit rock bottom. All Pro linebacker Fred Warner [was the latest casualty](https://ninerswire.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/niners/2025/11/28/49ers-fred-warner-injury-update/87510140007/), following [in the footsteps](https://www.sfgate.com/49ers/article/49ers-star-nick-bosa-spotted-walking-no-crutches-21165974.php) of All Pro edge rusher Nick Bosa with a season-ending injury. Brock Purdy had also struggled with injuries. George Kittle was hurt in Week 1. Both were not expected to return for several games. Brandon Aiyuk had no plans to play any time soon, at least not for San Francisco. By Week 7, the only big names in action were Christian McCaffrey and Trent Williams.

Dire as the 49ers appeared on paper, they hung in. It helped that the Cardinals, Falcons, Giants, and Panthers featured in their upcoming schedule. They beat all four of them, losing only to the Texans and Rams in the next few weeks. None of the wins inspired much confidence, though. The Cardinals outgained the 49ers by 200 yards.

Isaiah Horton caught three touchdown passes from Ty Simpson to help No10 Alabama survive blowing a 17-point lead to escape with a 27-20 win over rival and host Auburn in the Iron Bowl on Saturday night.

The Crimson Tide (10-2, 7-1 Southeastern Conference) not only clinched a spot in the SEC championship game v Georgia next Saturday with the dramatic victory, but they also likely locked up a spot in the College Football Playoff.

      <source:markdown>Former oversight officials alarmed by dismantling of DHS system that oversees complaints about civil rights harms

The federal watchdog system at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that oversees complaints about civil rights violations, including in immigration detention, has been gutted so thoroughly that it could be laying the groundwork for the Trump administration to “abuse people with impunity”, experts warn.

Former federal oversight officials have sounded the alarm at the rapid dismantling of guardrails against human rights failures – at the same time as the government [pushes](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/21/deportations-us-government-shutdown-ice-data) aggressive [immigration](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usimmigration) enforcement operations.

Border Patrol agents in Arizona forcibly removed a detained man from a cell, handcuffed him and then injected him with ketamine to sedate him in 2023, according to a [CRCL document](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26301388-cbp-ketamine-memo/) confirming the watchdog’s investigation into the allegation. A Guardian reporter had saved that document just weeks before it was scrubbed from the DHS’s website.

Guards at a privately owned Louisiana detention center systematically mistreated detained immigrants, according to a CRCL [document](https://rfkhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/assets/Pepper-spray-Incident-CRCL-Complaint-Winn_3.27.24.pdf).This included an investigation into a [2024 incident](https://theappeal.org/biden-admin-extended-contract-abusive-ice-detention-center/) during which correctional staff pepper sprayed around 200 detained immigrants who were staging a hunger strike in protest of detention conditions. Guards then allegedly locked the men in the unit and cut the power and water for hours. A majority of the men were allegedly denied medical care, the original [complaint](https://rfkhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/assets/Pepper-spray-Incident-CRCL-Complaint-Winn_3.27.24.pdf), submitted to the CRCL by RFK Human Rights, said.

In a Florida jail, a 33-year-old immigrant woman with mental health problems was forcibly stripped naked, strapped to a restraint chair and mocked by male guards, according to a CRCL [complaint](https://www.aclufl.org/app/uploads/2024/11/anas_crcl_final_version.pdf) submitted by the ACLU of Florida and RFK Human Rights. The woman was allegedly left with “contusions and marks on her body” after hours in the restraint chair. The whistleblower declaration said the CRCL had launched an investigation into the case.

Agents violated due process during the arrest and detention of Palestinian student and Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil, according to the whistleblower [complaint](https://whistleblower.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/05-15-2025-GovAcctProj-Whistleblower-Disclosures-to-Congress-re-CRCL.pdf).

A crusading prosecutor in the Balkans comes under pressure to drop a big case. Vietnamese villagers learn they are to be evicted. A convicted crypto kingpin in the Gulf receives a pardon.

All have one thing in common: they appear to be connected to the Trump family’s campaign to amass riches around the world. Since Donald Trump’s re-election a year ago, warnings that his use of presidential power to advance personal interests is corroding American democracy have grown ever louder. What is less understood – and perhaps even more dangerous – is the damage this is doing everywhere else.

Donald Trump’s hateful, falsehood-filled rant on Thursday blaming immigrants for crime, “social dysfunction” and economic hardship is refuted by a wide range of immigration statistics, which show clearly that immigrants dramatically [bolster the US economy](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/content/explainer-immigrants-and-us-economy) and commit crimes at far [lower rates](https://www.ucdavis.edu/curiosity/blog/do-immigrants-get-incarcerated-more) than people born in the US.

On Thursday evening, Trump condemned immigrants in [a broad and vicious invective](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1994262111145365516), painting them as “illegal and disruptive populations” and attacking “those that hate, steal, murder and destroy everything that America stands for”.

      <source:markdown>Next nominee faces enormous task of leading a party that has been entirely reoriented around Trump

Donald Trump hasn’t stopped joking about running again for the White House in 2028, even as he acknowledges it is “pretty clear” he is constitutionally ineligible for a third term. Whether intended as a taunt or a threat, his musings are a reminder that, even barred from the ballot, Trump is likely to remain a central figure in the campaign to succeed him.

The next Republican nominee faces the potentially enormous task of leading a party that has been entirely reoriented around Trump into a post-Trump era. Here’s a look at the Republicans best positioned for a White House run.

Retiring Georgia congresswoman **Marjorie Taylor Greene**

Homeland security secretary **Kristi Noem**

Health and human services secretary **Robert F Kennedy Jr**

Arkansas governor **Sarah Huckabee Sanders**

Virginia governor **Glenn Youngkin**

Georgia governor **Brian Kemp**

South Carolina senator **Tim Scott**

Former UN ambassador **Nikki Haley**

Utah governor **Spencer Cox**

He was the unremarkable New Jersey rhyme spitter by way of Brooklyn who was lucky enough to be a high school classmate of the mesmerizing Lauryn Hill and a cousin to mercurial Wyclef Jean.

Americans are feeling rattled about the state of the economy. Donald Trump has [batted away](https://x.com/Acyn/status/1986601008714424812) question after question from reporters on concerns over higher prices, just a year after he won an election promising to bring down costs.

While the White House has tried to [reduce concern](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/nov/23/affordability-crisis-inflation-costs), floating tariff-funded $2,000 stimulus checks and removing import levies on certain agricultural imports, many consumers remain anxious.

Speaking to Yahoo Sports recently about the launch of Project B, a startup global women’s basketball league, co-founder Grady Burnett <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/wnba/article/project-bs-ambitious-plans-to-reshape-womens-basketball--and-mens-too-154515719.html?guccounter=1">declared</a> that “women’s basketball is growing right now as fast as AI”. Come again? There’s no question that women’s basketball is growing nicely, a development that we should all cheer: this year’s WNBA season <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6723196/2025/10/16/wnba-ratings-viewers-2025-espn/">was the most watched ever</a>. But it is testing credulity to suggest that the sport is growing at anything like the same speed as AI, which since 2022 has gone from the technological margins to the very center of the US economy: by some reports, AI spending <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/how-the-u-s-economy-became-hooked-on-ai-spending-4b6bc7ff?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqfMMCxS4r_ieg846SmpYKXhi83N1_tT61NOcsbRXULw8ktKqwDjOYP2H1wttBw%3D&amp;gaa_ts=69250fa1&amp;gaa_sig=Xrvi-BHzE-4FtB6LgCkDcmZt9F_poOWghzsRHaRyHY7Bwc9pNrLgQZGEA4YxpLdkr7dqDpeqztjVKMWqdgEQ0w%3D%3D">accounted for</a> half of the growth in US GDP in the first half of this year. Perhaps I’m missing the real story here and the Federal Reserve is actively keeping tabs on attendance figures at Washington Mystics v Golden State Valkyries games for signs of potential overheating in the US economy. But it seems unlikely.</p><p>Claims like Burnett’s are par for the course in the hyperventilating world of sports investment, in which new leagues intent on world domination are launched seemingly every week and the pitches, delivered at investment conferences by slick men with gleaming teeth and spotless sneakers, grow more and more clammily self-satisfied by the hour. Burnett’s league, which he co-founded with former Skype co-founder Geoff Prentice, was briefly associated with Maverick Carter and LeBron James over the summer but that pair now seems <a href="https://www.thebiglead.com/lebron-james-partner-maverick-carter-reportedly-leaves-5-billion-nba-rival-project/">to have been removed</a> from the picture, and the league is emerging from “stealth mode”, to use a wormy bit of tech jargon, as the pure, uncut essence of bored Silicon Valley rich guy calculation. In a crowded field, Project B may be the most insanely overcaffeinated, tech bro-addled pitch for a new sports league yet.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/nov/28/from-value-adds-to-networking-superconductor-how-the-weird-language-of-tech-dulled-sport">Continue reading...</a>]]>

There’s no question that women’s basketball is growing nicely, a development that we should all cheer: this year’s WNBA season [was the most watched ever](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6723196/2025/10/16/wnba-ratings-viewers-2025-espn/). But it is testing credulity to suggest that the sport is growing at anything like the same speed as AI, which since 2022 has gone from the technological margins to the very center of the US economy: by some reports, AI spending [accounted for](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/how-the-u-s-economy-became-hooked-on-ai-spending-4b6bc7ff?gaa_at=eafs&#38;gaa_n=AWEtsqfMMCxS4r_ieg846SmpYKXhi83N1_tT61NOcsbRXULw8ktKqwDjOYP2H1wttBw%3D&#38;gaa_ts=69250fa1&#38;gaa_sig=Xrvi-BHzE-4FtB6LgCkDcmZt9F_poOWghzsRHaRyHY7Bwc9pNrLgQZGEA4YxpLdkr7dqDpeqztjVKMWqdgEQ0w%3D%3D) half of the growth in US GDP in the first half of this year. Perhaps I’m missing the real story here and the Federal Reserve is actively keeping tabs on attendance figures at Washington Mystics v Golden State Valkyries games for signs of potential overheating in the US economy. But it seems unlikely.

Claims like Burnett’s are par for the course in the hyperventilating world of sports investment, in which new leagues intent on world domination are launched seemingly every week and the pitches, delivered at investment conferences by slick men with gleaming teeth and spotless sneakers, grow more and more clammily self-satisfied by the hour. Burnett’s league, which he co-founded with former Skype co-founder Geoff Prentice, was briefly associated with Maverick Carter and LeBron James over the summer but that pair now seems [to have been removed](https://www.thebiglead.com/lebron-james-partner-maverick-carter-reportedly-leaves-5-billion-nba-rival-project/) from the picture, and the league is emerging from “stealth mode”, to use a wormy bit of tech jargon, as the pure, uncut essence of bored Silicon Valley rich guy calculation. In a crowded field, Project B may be the most insanely overcaffeinated, tech bro-addled pitch for a new sports league yet.

      <source:markdown>Exclusive: It follows calls from US senator Elizabeth Warren to investigate bank executives including ex-Barclays boss Jes Staley

US regulators say they are taking allegations that top banks may have facilitated Jeffrey Epstein’s criminal activity “very seriously”, as they faced calls to investigate executives including the former Barclays boss Jes Staley.

In correspondence seen by the Guardian, bosses from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) said they [had reviewed a letter from the Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/28/elizabeth-warren-urges-us-regulators-to-investigate-jes-staley-ties-to-epstein), which raised concerns over bankers’ alleged support for the convicted child sex offender Epstein.

      <source:markdown>As navies seek to counter submarines and protect cables, startups and big defence companies fight to lead market

Flying drones used during the Ukraine war have [changed land battle tactics](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/06/drones-evolving-technology-at-ukraine-conflict-heart) for ever. Now the same thing appears to be happening under the sea.

Navies around the world are racing to add autonomous submarines. The UK’s Royal Navy is planning a fleet of underwater uncrewed vehicles (UUVs) which will, for the first time, take a leading role in tracking submarines and protecting undersea cables and pipelines. Australia has committed to spending $1.7bn (£1.3bn) [on “Ghost Shark” submarines](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/sep/10/ghost-shark-submarine-drone-australian-navy-explainer) to counter Chinese submarines.

- Post-career reputation marred by remarks about Woods

- Trump pays tribute to ‘remarkable person and player’


Fuzzy Zoeller, the two-time major champion whose genial public persona was overshadowed by a racially insensitive joke about Tiger Woods that came to define the latter part of his career, has died aged 74.

No cause of death was immediately available. Brian Naugle, tournament director of the Insperity Invitational in Houston and a longtime colleague, said Zoeller’s daughter notified him of the death on Thursday.

Small changes to the tone of posts fed to users of X can increase feelings of political polarisation as much in a week as would have historically taken at least three years, research has found.

A groundbreaking experiment to gauge the potency of Elon Musk’s social platform to increase political division found that when posts expressing anti-democratic attitudes and partisan animosity were boosted, even barely perceptibly, in the feeds of Democrat and Republican supporters there was a large change in their unfavourable feelings towards the other side.

Parts of the US midwest and the Great Lakes region are bracing for a strong storm this weekend, as an estimated 82 million Americans travel to gather in celebration of Thanksgiving.

Some parts of the country are expecting cold, snowy conditions, and the weather has already caused some travel delays. On Thursday morning [more than 800](https://www.flightaware.com/live/cancelled/today) flights were already delayed, most in the northern states.

      <source:markdown>On Wednesday, Rahmanullah Lakanwal shot troop members Sarah Beckstrom and Andrew Wolfe

Two national guard members shot on Wednesday in [Washington DC](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/washington-dc) are in critical condition. Here’s what we know so far:

At 2.15pm on Wednesday, a man is alleged to have launched what Jeanine Pirro, the US attorney for the District of Columbia, has called an “ambush-style” gun attack two blocks north-west of the White House on two members of the West Virginia national guard.

The guard members – named as Sarah Beckstrom, 20, and Andrew Wolfe, 24, both newly sworn-in – are currently [hospitalized in critical condition](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/26/national-guard-soldiers-shot-washington-dc).

The suspect, [Rahmanullah Lakanwal](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/27/washington-dc-national-guard-shooting-suspect), 29, was shot at the scene by a third guard member and is being treated in hospital after being arrested. His wounds are not believed to be life-threatening.

Lakanwal faces charges of assault with intent to kill while armed and possession of a firearm during a crime of violence, though if the [national guard members](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/26/white-house-washington-national-guard) die, the charges could be upgraded to first-degree murder.

His motives remain unclear: Pirro has said that “it’s too soon to say” and Jeffery Carroll, an executive assistant DC police chief, said that investigators had no information on a motive and the suspect “came around the corner” and immediately started firing at the troops.

He had driven across the US from the home he shares with his wife and five children in Bellingham, Washington state, allegedly to conduct the attack.

He is believed to have acted alone.

Lakanwal worked with the [CIA in Afghanistan](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/27/washington-dc-national-guard-shooting-suspect), and came to the US in 2021 as part of a program to resettle Afghans who had aided US operations there. The CIA director, John Ratcliffe, said Lakanwal was “a member of a partner force in Kandahar”.

The [Trump administration](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration) has responded to the shooting by ordering 500 more national guard members to Washington, and calling for the reinvestigation of all Afghan refugees who entered under the Biden administration.

US citizenship and immigration services also [said](https://x.com/USCIS/status/1993882694640415163) it has stopped processing all immigration requests for Afghan nationals “pending further review of security and vetting protocols”.

Good morning.

Donald Trump has said the [government should review every Afghan immigrant who entered the US](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/26/washington-national-guard-shooting-suspect) during Joe Biden’s administration, after authorities identified the suspect in the shooting of two national guard members in Washington as an Afghan national.

**What is the latest on the condition of the national guard members?** They remained in critical condition overnight.

**Have there been arrests?** Yes – police have arrested two directors and an engineering consultant at a construction company.

The United States is a country of immigrants but the NFL remains dominated by players born in the USA. Only 5% of players are born abroad and the majority of them make the step into the sport by going to college in the US. True outsiders are unusual and foreign coaches are especially rare, which makes James Cook’s story remarkable.

Cook has been in charge of player development at Cleveland Browns for the past six months. That’s an achievement in itself but it’s extraordinary considering he grew up in Surrey, is in his late 20s and never played professional sport. Cook discovered the NFL as a 12-year-old when he was channel-flicking with his dad and came across “this weird and wonderful” sport. He started playing locally and soon wanted to become the first NFL quarterback born in Europe.

The scene around Washington’s Farragut Square on Wednesday afternoon seemed to fit Donald Trump’s most lurid stereotypes of a crime-ridden capital in need of federal troops to bring a firm smack of law and order.

An area normally the preserve of professional office workers, coffee shops and lunch venues instead bore the hallmarks of a major crime scene as news spread that two national guard troops had been shot. Authorities [later said the shooting suspect had been identified](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/26/washington-national-guard-shooting-suspect) as an Afghan man.

A federal three-judge panel on Wednesday allowed North Carolina to use a redrawn congressional map aimed at flipping a seat to Republicans as part of Donald Trump’s multi-state redistricting campaign ahead of the 2026 elections.

The new map takes aim at North Carolina’s only swing seat, currently held by Democrat Don Davis, an African American who represents more than 20 counties in the state’s north-east. The first district has been represented by Black members of Congress continuously for more than 30 years.

The [Trump administration](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration) is seeking to abandon a rule that sets tough standards for deadly soot pollution, arguing that the Biden administration did not have authority to set the tighter standard on pollution from tailpipes, smokestacks and other industrial sources.

The action follows moves by the administration last week to [weaken federal rules protecting millions of acres of wetlands and streams](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/17112025/trump-administration-weakens-waterways-wetlands-federal-protections/) and [roll back protections for imperiled species](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/20/trump-endangered-species-act) and the places they live. In a separate action, the interior department [proposed new oil drilling off the California and Florida coasts](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/20/white-house-new-oil-gas-drilling-california-florida) for the first time in decades, advancing a project that critics say could harm coastal communities and ecosystems.

      <source:markdown>Witkoff also offered tactical guidance on how Putin should raise subject with Trump, audio recording suggests. Plus, the female pilots on Ukraine’s frontline

Good morning.

Donald Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, told a senior Kremlin official last month that achieving peace in Ukraine [would require Russia gaining control of Donetsk](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/25/trump-envoy-on-russia-ukraine-peace-deal) and potentially a separate territorial exchange, according to a recording of their conversation.

**What did Witkoff say?** “Now, me to you, I know what it’s going to take to get a peace deal done: Donetsk and maybe a land swap somewhere,” Witkoff told Ushakov during the five-minute conversation, according to a transcript of the recording obtained by Bloomberg. “But I’m saying instead of talking like that, let’s talk more hopefully because I think we’re going to get to a deal here.”

**This is a developing story.** Follow the liveblog [here](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/nov/26/russia-ukraine-war-peace-plan-europe-latest-news-updates).

**What has changed?** It marks a sharp departure from Donald Trump’s narrative to the public every time he has discussed the 21 strikes that have killed more than 80 people, which he has portrayed as an effort to stop overdose deaths.

**What have the White House said?** A White House official responded that Trump had not been making a legal argument. Still, the president’s remarks remain the only public reason for why the US is firing missiles – when the legal justification is in fact very different.

Good morning.

A federal judge [threw out the criminal cases against James Comey and Letitia James](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/24/james-comey-letitia-james-charges-case-dismissed) yesterday, concluding that the prosecutor handling the cases was unlawfully appointed.

**What did the judge say?** “I conclude that the attorney general’s attempt to install Ms Halligan as interim US attorney for the eastern district of Virginia was invalid and that Ms Halligan has been unlawfully serving in that role since 22 September 2025,” wrote Currie, who was appointed to the bench by Bill Clinton.

**When did the talks begin?** Reports emerged that a fresh round of US-brokered peace talks had begun last night in the capital of the United Arab Emirates, with Dan Driscoll, the US army secretary, flying in to meet a Russian delegation and a Ukrainian team led by Kyrylo Budanov.

A majority of Latinos disapprove of Donald Trump and his economic and immigration policies, according to [a new report](https://www.pewresearch.org/race-and-ethnicity/2025/11/24/majorities-of-latinos-disapprove-of-trump-and-his-policies-on-immigration-economy/?_gl=1%2A1k4pmdf%2A_up%2AMQ..%2A_gs%2AMQ..&#38;gclid=Cj0KCQiAoZDJBhC0ARIsAERP-F9FVusKoTUXKNwsxVF7Op3CIaTC4F9gik34xgBC5D8Ni1_jfG2Q98caArkIEALw_wcB&#38;gbraid=0AAAAA_c1WRm0AZFiMW3uClUkzhkA_FxF0) from the Pew Research Center.

After receiving support from nearly half of Latino voters in the 2024 election, Trump had lost the backing of a majority surveyed in October. Pew found that 70% of Latinos “disapprove of the way Trump is handling his job as president”, while 65% disapprove of his administration’s approach to immigration and 61% believe his economic policies have worsened economic conditions.

      <source:markdown>Former Republican congressman and presidential candidate voices support for six Democrats, saying ‘our illegal process of going into war needs to be addressed’

The president was online early today, and fired off a Truth Social post at 5:38am touting the economic impact that his sweeping tariffs will soon have on the country. He also noted that countries’ efforts to stockpile US goods ahead of the levies kicking in was “wearing thin”.

Donald Trump on Sunday appeared to endorse the discredited conspiracy theory that Venezuela’s leadership controls electronic voting software worldwide and caused his 2020 election defeat to Joe Biden.

White House officials have previously said that Trump’s increasingly bellicose policy toward Venezuela is driven by concerns about migration and the drug trade. But the president’s new comment, made on [Truth Social](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115600167812342707), hints that his hostility to Venezuela may also be based on an outlandish, implausible theory ruled to be false by a judge in 2023.

Authorities in [California](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california) are searching for the body of a man who was swept into the ocean at a beach in the Big Sur area, one week after a girl and her father died after being pulled into the water in the same state park.

      <source:markdown>Disqualifications of Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri bring unnecessary stress for McLaren in the final two F1 races of the season

As misjudgments go, McLaren’s error in calculations that led [to the disqualification of Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/nov/23/max-verstappen-wins-f1-las-vegas-gp-lando-norris-second) from the Las Vegas Grand Prix on Sunday could barely have been more cataclysmic nor more poorly timed. Quite how they got it wrong just when they wanted to close out the drivers’ championship with as little fuss as possible will take no little explanation.

Norris and Piastri, second and fourth respectively to Max Verstappen’s win in Nevada, had been solid enough results until the FIA discovered the skid blocks on their cars had been worn beyond the 9mm limit. In one fell swoop, Verstappen was right back in the fight, alongside Piastri, 24 points back from Norris.

Good morning.

Senator Mark Kelly yesterday urged congressional Republicans to publicly reject Trump’s threats against him and five other Democratic lawmakers who have said that military personnel are not obliged to follow illegal commands.

**What did Kelly say?** “His words carry tremendous weight, more so than anybody else in the country, and he should be aware of that, and because of what he says, there is now increased threats against us,” Kelly said of Trump’s accusations.

**What does the original plan say?** The original [28-point US document](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/20/us-russia-reportedly-draft-plan-end-ukraine-war-zelenskyy) leaked last week demanded that Ukraine should hand over territory to Russia, limit the size of its army and agree not to pursue the Kremlin for alleged war crimes.

      <source:markdown>Exodus of lawyers under Trump weakens department’s capacity in civil rights, national security and other areas

Donald Trump’s weaponization of the US department of justice to focus on retribution against political foes, on fulfilling Maga goals and on granting pardons for allies has seen thousands of lawyers depart or be fired and weakened investigations in civil rights, national security and other areas, say ex-prosecutors and legal experts.

Data compiled by the nonpartisan Justice Connection showed that overall DoJ employment has dropped by about 5,500 lawyers and non-lawyers who have left since Trump took office. That included people who were fired, quit or took a deferred resignation program, underscoring a sharp drop in DoJ resources. By contrast, the department last year employed about 10,000 attorneys, according to DoJ data.

      <source:markdown>Physicians say FDA panel conflated two issues and made baseless claims about unproven health benefits

Estrogen-related medications for menopause will no longer carry broad black-box warnings, Marty Makary, commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), announced last week, bypassing the regulatory agency’s typical process and, according to experts, overstating the science behind the medications – with troubling implications for future drug decisions.

The decision to remove an ominous warning from 2003 about the risks of cardiovascular disease, breast cancer and dementia makes sense for local vaginal estrogen products, but systemic estrogen is more complicated, menopause experts said – and more than these nuances, they worried about the scientific process, or lack thereof, in making the decision.

Northwestern Mutual likes to think of itself as a storied American institution offering specialized financial advice. The 168-year-old financial giant, ranked 109 on the Fortune 500, and regularly anointed one of the World’s Most Admired Companies by the magazine, [describes](https://www.northwesternmutual.com/who-we-are/) its financial advisers as “expert listeners” or a “trusted partner who helps you continue to reach goal after goal”.

If you feel like the price of [Thanksgiving](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/thanksgiving) this year is more expensive to gobble up, you’re not alone. Amid widening concerns about the [rising cost of living](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/nov/23/affordability-crisis-inflation-costs), polls [show](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/16/inflation-economic-pessimism-poll) consumers are increasingly worried about inflation.

Economists say the picture for holiday food prices this year is more mixed – prices are volatile and depend largely on how families shop around for their feast.

      <source:markdown>Dr. Carlos Chaccour, physician scientist at the University of Navarra, noticed something fishy about a letter to the editor the New England Journal of Medicine received shortly after it published a paper of his on malaria treatment in July.

The letter was riddled with strange errors such as critiques supposedly based on other research Chaccour himself had written. So he and his co-author Matthew Rudd decided to dig deeper.

They analyzed patterns of letters to the editor over the last decade and found a remarkable increase in what they call &#34;prolific debutantes&#34; — new authors who suddenly had dozens, even hundreds of letters published, starting right around the time OpenAI’s ChatGPT came out.

Why would academics want to do this? Marketplace’s Meghan McCarty Carino spoke with Chaccour to find out.</source:markdown>

      <source:markdown>Statement by Trump administration confirms longstanding suspicions that Musk-led agency is on its way out

The “department of government efficiency” (Doge) has apparently been dissolved with eight months still remaining on its contract, ending a drawn-out campaign of invading federal agencies and firing thousands of federal workers.

“That doesn’t exist,” office of personnel management (OPM) director Scott Kupor told Reuters earlier this month when asked about Doge’s status, adding that it was no longer a “centralized entity”.

Football in Oakland, California, is more than a sport. It’s a community. In many schools, coaches are like parental figures who get young people through vulnerable times, into universities and sometimes even drafted to the National Football League.

So when gun violence came for longtime Oakland football coach John Beam, whose mentorship had changed the lives of generations of students, the devastation reverberated around the city.

      <source:markdown>Guilty plea by far-right activist lays bare plans for bombings, school shootings and Santas handing out poisoned candies

Michail Chkhikvishvili, a self-described cult leader who called himself “Commander Butcher”, did not look like a Hollywood vision of a contemporary terrorist, despite the bizarre, almost made-for-TV extremist actions he planned, such as having people dressed as Santa Claus hand out poison candies on the streets of New York.

Chkhikvishvili appeared in a Brooklyn court last week as one might find an office IT tech: close-cropped hair and black-rimmed glasses, attentive, clear-spoken and cooperative as he was questioned about his understanding of a plea that could see him imprisoned for up to 18 years at his March sentencing.

A survivor of [Jeffrey Epstein](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein)’s abuse has condemned [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump) for dismissing the victims’ fight for transparency as a “hoax”.

Shortly after [signing a bill to release the Epstein files](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/19/trump-sign-bill-epstein-files), the US president posted a lengthy social media rant accusing [Democrats](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats) of weaponising the scandal against him.

Sherman’s earliest memories of food were full of history, culture and spiritualism.

His idealistic experiences of harvesting and hunting for food on the reservation were juxtaposed with the legacy of colonialism. Most of the time, Sherman and his family ate government-issued food such as canned beef, or blocks of cow cheese, which diverged from their traditional diet. It’s a tale that Sherman, co-founder of the Minneapolis-based Indigenous restaurant [Owamni](https://owamni.com/), shares along with other stories in a new cookbook that highlights Indigenous cuisines throughout North America.

      <source:markdown>The costs of groceries, housing, childcare, education and healthcare have become intolerable to many

Frozen dinners were useful when no one was home to cook. A fancy cheese or apple roll felt like a family treat. But not any more. “We can’t afford to do those little luxuries any more because they’re just too expensive to feed five with,” says Cat Hill. “There’s not any wiggle room.”

The 43-year-old from Hornby, New York, has been hit by both higher grocery prices and rising costs for her small business running a horse stable. Under [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump), she worries it may get even harder. “With this administration, it doesn’t appear to be stabilising,” she adds. “It’s hard to think about how exactly we are going to ride this out.”

Little in Dan Driscoll’s résumé – past or present – suggests he has the qualifications to understand the often-tortured and bloody history of relations between [Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia) and [Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine).

A former investment banker with a degree in business administration, the current US army secretary’s main calling card for a prominent role in the Trump administration may be a friendship with [JD Vance](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jd-vance) dating from when they were at Yale Law School together.

One morning in October, Donna DesRuisseaux headed to a local bridge near her home in Goffstown, New Hampshire, armed with a sign that said: “Honk for democracy.” The 62-year-old business manager was taking part in a new tradition of protesting on various bridges and overpasses throughout the state.

      <source:markdown>Despite the US’s economic success, income inequality remains breathtaking. But this is no glitch – it’s the system

The Chinese did rather well in the age of globalization. In 1990, 943 million people there lived on less than $3 a day measured in 2021 dollars – 83% of the population, according to the World Bank. By 2019, the [number was brought down to zero](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.DDAY?locations=CN). Unfortunately, the United States was [not as successful](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.DDAY?locations=US). More than 4 million Americans – 1.25% of the population – must make ends meet with less than $3 a day, more than three times as many as 35 years ago.

The data is not super consistent with the narrative of the US’s inexorable success. Sure, American productivity has zoomed ahead of that of its European peers. Only a handful of countries manage to produce more stuff per hour of work. And artificial intelligence now promises to put the United States that much further ahead.

Rain falls in thin, needling lines over Hell’s Kitchen as Devin Haney walks into the Victory Boxing Gym. Somewhere along Ninth Avenue an ambulance threads through the congestion, its siren drawn out into a long, mournful ribbon that slips past the gym’s walls. He nods to a few familiar faces, peels off a Supreme Vanson leather jacket and begins to unwrap himself from the city. His father, Bill, arrives a step behind him, not so much entering the room as taking possession of it.

“The youngest undisputed champion!” Bill cries out, half to the gym, half to himself. “He’s done it on three continents! Twenty-six years old and still writing history! Let the sparks fly!”

New Orleanians are bracing for a major deployment of US border patrol officers to the city, as Donald Trump forges on with his mass deportation agenda and sweeping federal [immigration crackdown](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usimmigration) in Democrat-led cities.

Despite [falling crime](https://nopdnews.com/post/may-2025/nopd-reports-continued-significant-decrease-in-vio/), as many as 250 federal agents are expected to descend on New Orleans imminently to begin laying the groundwork for “Operation Swamp Sweep”, which [the Associated Press reported](https://apnews.com/article/federal-immigration-crackdown-new-orleans-55119a4cf4e6da418e38287cb20c0ef4) is due to launch in south-east Louisiana and Mississippi on 1 December with the stated aim of arresting 5,000 people.

The prominent linguist and philosopher [Noam Chomsky](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/noam-chomsky) called it a “most valuable experience” to have maintained “regular contact” with [Jeffrey Epstein](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein), who by then had long been convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor, according to emails released earlier in November this month by US lawmakers.

Such comments from Chomsky, or attributed to him, suggest his association with Epstein – who officials concluded killed himself in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges – went deeper than the occasional political and academic discussions the former [had previously claimed](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/17/jeffrey-epstein-noam-chomsky-bard-college-president) to have with the latter.

Donald [Trump embraced Zohran Mamdani](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/21/trump-mamdani-white-house-new-york), a democratic socialist set to be the first Muslim mayor of New York, like a brother.

And then Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Trump acolyte-turned-nemesis who bested him over the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files, stunned the political establishment again. In what should have been her hour of triumph, the Maga star abruptly [announced that she was quitting](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/21/marjorie-taylor-greene-resigns) the House of Representatives.

The extraordinary exchange was sparked after Democratic lawmakers with military or national security backgrounds – the Congressional representatives Maggie Goodlander, Jason Crow, Chris DeLuzio and Chrissy Houlahan, and the senators Mark Kelly and Elissa Slotkin – posted a [video](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2558895077819811) on Facebook addressed to US service members.

It was hard to choose one favourite photo from football’s double-header at the White House this week. In part this is because the pictures from Donald Trump’s [state dinner with Mohammed bin Salman](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/18/trump-bin-salman-visit-jamal-khashoggi) and his in-house hype men Cristiano Ronaldo and Gianni Infantino were everywhere, recycled feverishly across the internet, dusted with their own drool-stained commentary by the wider Ronaldo-verse.

Mainly there were just so many jaw-droppers. Perhaps you liked the one of Trump and Ronaldo strolling the halls of power, Ronaldo dressed all in black and laughing uproariously, like a really happy ninja. Or the one of Ronaldo and Georgina Rodríguez standing either side of a weirdly beaming Trump at his desk, holding up some kind of large heraldic key as though they’ve just been presented with their own wind-up wooden sex-grandad.

- Hamilton woes continue with last-place finish for Ferrari


Lando Norris claimed pole position at the Las Vegas Grand Prix in treacherous, wet conditions on the street circuit in Nevada to move one step closer to taking his first Formula One world championship.

The British driver’s march to the title looks increasingly likely with pole at what has been a bogey circuit for McLaren.

Norris beat the Red Bull of Max Verstappen into second and, with his closest title rival and teammate Oscar Piastri in fifth, he can further extend his advantage at the top of the standings on Sunday. Indeed, he had been so cool in advance that he took in spot of shut-eye before it began and then weathered the hazardous conditions with insouciance.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics canceled the release of the closely watched consumer price index (CPI) for October, citing the government shutdown – the longest in history, before it [ended earlier this month](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/12/house-bill-government-shutdown-vote) – and stating it could not “retroactively collect” the data required for the report.

One crisp morning in 2018, Sandra Ibarra pulled on a pair of gloves to ward off the winter chill and picked up the first cardboard sign she had designed for a protest.

As a recent immigrant to the United States, Ibarra was wary of attending a demonstration. But since arriving in the United States from Mexico she had had to change careers – it was difficult to recertify her licensing as an accountant in a new country and easier to begin working in childcare – and was shocked by the poor pay.

      <source:markdown>As little as a decade ago it would have been unthinkable that an American institution such as Disney would have chosen to hitch its wagon to F1

The remarkable nature of the transformation in Formula One’s fortunes in the United States could not have been better illustrated than by the incongruous sight of Mickey Mouse and an assortment of his Disney pals leading a gang of enthusiastic fans on a walk down the pit lane at the Las Vegas Grand Prix.

F1 successfully hosting a race in Sin City and the US now boasting three sellout meetings is testament to the sport’s burgeoning prosperity. For all of the somewhat surreal edge of seeing Donald Duck and Goofy outside garages, the fact Disney has chosen F1 as a partner is indicative of the sea change the sport has brought about in a market it has long coveted.

The FBI spied on a private Signal group chat of immigrants’ rights activists who were organizing “courtwatch” efforts in New York City this spring, law enforcement records shared with the Guardian indicate.

The FBI, the documents show, gained access to conversations in a “courtwatch” Signal group that helps coordinate volunteer activists who monitor public proceedings at three New York federal immigration courts. The US government has repeatedly been [accused](https://www.npr.org/2025/08/25/nx-s1-5503595/immigration-court-new-york) of [violating](https://immigrantjustice.org/press-release/unlawful-ice-arrests-at-immigration-courthouses-prompt-lawsuit-by-advocates-and-immigrants/) immigrants’ [due process](https://www.nycbar.org/reports/case-dismissals-in-immigration-court-to-facilitate-ice-arrests-violates-due-process-and-undermines-access-to-humanitarian-protections/) rights at those courts.

Good morning.

Democrats [expressed outrage](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/20/democrats-condemn-trump-military-video-post) after Donald Trump accused a group of Democratic lawmakers of engaging in “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH” and that they should be arrested after they posted a video in which they told active service members they should refuse illegal orders.

**What did the lawmakers say in the video?** “Our laws are clear: you can refuse illegal orders, you must refuse illegal orders. No one has to carry out orders that violate the law or our constitution.”

**What did the report say?** A “joint situational information report” from the FBI and the New York police department (NYPD), dated 28 August 2025, quoted from a chat on Signal, the encrypted messaging app, and also characterized the court watchers as “anarchist violent extremist actors”.

**Where did it come from?** The two-page report was distributed to other law enforcement agencies across the US. The records were obtained by [Property of the People](https://propertyofthepeople.org/), a government transparency non-profit, through public records requests.

      <source:markdown>- Allen sacked eight times in bruising Houston loss

- Rookie Calen Bullock seals win with late interception

- Shakir, Cook star but title-tipped Bills fall to 7–4


Little went right for Josh Allen in a frustrating game Thursday night against the Houston Texans. And still he came close to willing the Buffalo Bills to a victory before an interception in the final minute sealed their fate in a 23-19 loss.

Allen took consecutive sacks on the Bills’ final possession, leading to a fourth-and-27, but Buffalo (7-4) gained 44 yards on a short pass from Allen to Josh Palmer, who tossed a lateral to Khalil Shakir. After a false-start penalty created a fourth-and-6 for Buffalo (7-4), Calen Bullock picked off Allen’s pass at the Houston 9 with 24 seconds left.

Good morning.

US and Russian officials have [quietly drafted a new plan to end the war in Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/19/us-and-russian-officials-draft-new-peace-plan-based-on-capitulation-from-ukraine) that would require Kyiv to cede territory and severely cut the size of its military, it was reported on Wednesday, in a development that Kyiv will probably view as surrender.

**Is this plan formally backed by the Trump administration?** That’s still unclear, as Witkoff and Dmitriev have created an informal backchannel.

**What has the EU said?** Any peace plan needs Kyiv and Europe “on board”. Foreign ministers are meeting today to discuss this – [follow our live blog here](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/nov/20/ukraine-russia-peace-plan-european-union-donald-trump-vladimir-putin-kaja-kallas-europe-live-news-updates?page=with%3Ablock-691ed2af8f084e05b1cbbf15#block-691ed2af8f084e05b1cbbf15).

**What will the justice department actually release?** All files related to Epstein – including the investigation into his death by suicide in prison. While they can redact identifying information about victims, it specifically bars officials from declining to disclose information over concerns about “embarrassment, reputational harm or political sensitivity”.

Sergio Busquets didn’t expect to last this long. More than a decade ago, he predicted he’d retire by his early 30s. But when he finally announced in September that he’ll hang up his boots at the end of Inter Miami’s season, he did so as a 37-year-old defensive midfielder who still somehow never leaves the pitch for one of the best teams in MLS.

He could be playing his final game this weekend, if Miami lose their conference semi-final against FC Cincinnati on Sunday.

      <source:markdown>Tucker Carlson’s interview with the activist revealed the mainstream right is being flooded by extremism – and it’s now impossible to contain

Five days a week, thousands of fans gather online to watch Nick Fuentes hold court about the dangers of non-white immigration, feminism and “organized Jewry”. Usually dressed in a dark suit and tie, he lectures to his far-right followers, known as “Groypers”, about what he argues is the insufficient radicalism of Donald Trump’s Republican party and what he describes as the perfidies of the state of Israel and its American supporters.

Fuentes’s fixation with Israel is not rooted in concern about the war in Gaza but a belief, in his telling, that Jews are responsible for most of society’s problems. Fuentes, who is 27 and lives in Illinois, has called Adolf Hitler “really fucking cool” and compared the Holocaust to the baking of cookies.

Healthcare providers across the country have closed clinics and hospital wards in the four months since [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump) signed into law the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the landmark tax-and-spending legislation that will lead an estimated [10 million people to lose their health insurance](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61367).

The law is expected to slash federal funding by hundreds of billions of dollars over the coming years, as part of Trump’s campaign pledge to shrink government spending. Though the bill isn’t thought to be the only cause of the closures – it may have an impact on local healthcare settings that are financially struggling.

      <source:markdown>Experts fear plan, one of many attempts Trump’s made to dismantle wildlife protection, will speed up extinction crisis

The Trump administration presented a new plan to roll back regulations in the Endangered Species Act (ESA) on Wednesday, a move experts fear will accelerate the extinction crisis if adopted.

[The proposed](https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USDOI/bulletins/3fc00d6) [changes](https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USDOI/bulletins/3fc00d6) would allow the federal government more power to weigh economic impact against habitat designations, remove safeguards against future events – including the impacts from the climate crisis – and rescind the “blanket rule” that automatically grants threatened species the same protections as those designated as endangered.

Republicans have controlled Tennessee’s seventh congressional district for four decades. The party finished about 21 points ahead of the Democrats when the seat was last contested, alongside [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump)’s victory in the presidential election last November.

Twelve months on, that lead has narrowed dramatically, according to opinion polls – and a challenger is attempting to build a “coalition of the pissed off” to overturn it altogether.

Senior White House officials have discussed internally their preference for Paramount Skydance to acquire Warner Bros Discovery in recent weeks, and one official has discussed potential programming changes at CNN with Larry Ellison, the largest shareholder of Paramount.

The discussions, according to people familiar with the matter, come as Paramount portrays itself as the best bid for Warner Bros Discovery, after the company announced last month it was open to offers, because it would have an easier time getting through regulatory review.

Federal prosecutors on Wednesday [said](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/11/19/comey-trump-abuse-power-hearing/) they had never presented the final version of the indictment filed against [James Comey](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/james-comey) to a full federal grand jury, a concession that adds to mounting challenges in their effort to prosecute the former FBI director.

Prosecutors acknowledged the omission during a Wednesday hearing in which Comey’s lawyers argued the case against him should be dismissed because it was a selective and vindictive prosecution.

His “Make America great again” base, and the bulk of the Republican party, stood with him through (deep breath): two impeachments, children in cages, “very fine people on both sides”, 34 felony convictions, an insurrection, “shithole countries”, attempting to overturn an election, hush money payments to an adult film actor, “they’re rapists”, a brutal immigration crackdown, Four Seasons Total Landscaping, “grab ‘em by the pussy”, billions of dollars made by the Trump family, cosying up to dictators, [“don’t look!”](https://www.vice.com/en/article/trump-stares-into-the-sun-as-aide-screams-dont-look/#:~:text=Today%20President%20Trump%20stepped%20out,stared%20dumbly%20into%20the%20sun.), mass pardons for his allies and friends, an unfinished wall, [“liberation day”](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/17/trump-liberation-day-tariff-walk-back), presenting himself [as a king](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/19/trump-backlash-social-media-king), forcing [Donald Trump Jr](https://cdn.britannica.com/76/233676-050-34726587/American-businessman-Donald-Trump-Jr-2018.jpg?w=300) into the public consciousness, [and more](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/nov/19/trump-emissions-policy-could-cause-climate-deaths).

Trump has responded to the insubordination in the ways he knows best: pettiness and cruelty.

Tamara Thomsen, the state’s maritime archaeologist, said the site lies near a network of what were once Indigenous trails, suggesting ancient people left the canoes there for anyone to use as they traveled, much like a modern-day e-bike rack.

Officials relayed these messages over the last several days to stakeholders in the government and private industry, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter and a third person briefed on the conversations. A fourth person following the matter also said the administration was taking a more cautious approach to avoid provoking China. The discussions have not been previously reported.

The intensively discussed files related to the disgraced former financier and sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein passed a significant milestone on Tuesday when Congress voted overwhelmingly in favor of releasing them.

After months of deliberate delays and manoeuvres, the House of Representatives voted by 427 to one in favor of the Epstein Files Transparency Act, legislation which would, if enacted, require the justice department to release all unclassified materials on Epstein, who died in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges. The Senate has unanimously agreed to swiftly pass the bill, which would then head to the White House for Donald Trump’s signature.

Major League Soccer announced on Wednesday that it is re-opening its investigation into Philadelphia Union sporting director Ernst Tanner. The Union said in a statement to the Guardian that they have placed Tanner on administrative leave. The move comes a day after the Guardian published [an investigation into Tanner’s conduct](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/nov/18/philadelphia-union-ernst-tanner-mls-investigation).

Tanner had previously been under investigation by MLS after the league received a complaint from the MLS Players Association in late January. In it, the MLSPA outlined a wide range of alleged issues surrounding Tanner, which included the use of racist, sexist and homophobic language and instances of inappropriate physical contact with a staff member.

Made multiple misogynistic comments, including saying “women don’t belong in men’s soccer” about a female MLS referee and telling a gathering of academy players that they “should never worry about a referee, unless she’s a woman.”

Directed a homophobic slur at an MLS referee in 2023

Spoke about Black players “like they were subhuman” and suggested that Black referees “lack intelligence and capability.”

Touched a co-worker inappropriately “numerous times,” an allegation for which he was reported to the Union’s HR department.

Hired an underqualified coach who was allegedly abusive toward players on the Philadelphia Union II, the club’s reserve team that is used as a proving ground for young players from its thriving academy.

The Senate approved legislation on Wednesday that would force the release of investigative files related to the late pedophile [Jeffrey Epstein](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein), the morning after a near-unanimous vote in the [US House](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/house-of-representatives).

By unanimous consent, the Senate agreed to pass the measure as soon as it arrived in the chamber from the House on Tuesday, which had overwhelmingly approved the bill earlier that day in a 427-1 tally. Once the legislation is forwarded to the Senate, it will be automatically approved and cleared for Trump’s signature. The president, who dropped his opposition after it was clear it would pass, has said he would sign it.

Good morning.

The Senate moved swiftly yesterday [to approve legislation](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/18/house-vote-epstein-documents) that would force the release of investigative files related to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, hours after a near-unanimous vote in the House, almost wrapping up a bipartisan effort Donald Trump had fought for months.

**How did we get here?** The Epstein case returned dramatically to the public eye in July, when the justice department and FBI [released a memo](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/07/jeffrey-epstein-suicide-justice-department-fbi-review-confirms) saying they had nothing further to disclose about the investigation. That contradicted statements that the administration would release more information about Epstein in office.

**Why has Trump been unable to escape this** **case?** The Epstein scandal is a core issue for a swathe of Trump’s rightwing base, some of whom believe in conspiracy theories that surround Epstein and his coterie of powerful friends. Unlike many other issues, the Epstein files have prompted rebellions from Trump’s supporters.

      <source:markdown>Trump administration proposal would exclude elite schools that use diversity, equity and inclusion hiring practices

The state department is proposing to suspend 38 universities including Harvard and Yale from a federal research partnership program because they engage in diversity, equity and inclusion hiring practices, according to an internal memo and spreadsheet obtained by the Guardian.

The memo, dated 17 November, recommends excluding institutions from the Diplomacy Lab – a program that pairs university researchers with state department policy offices – if they “openly engage in DEI hiring practices” or set DEI objectives for candidate pools.

More than 97% of immigrants detained in the Trump administration’s “Operation Midway Blitz” in Chicago had no criminal conviction, according to federal court records.

The data, released on Friday and [first reported by the Chicago Tribune](https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/11/14/only-2-5-on-list-of-614-operation-midway-blitz-arrestees-had-criminal-histories-doj-records-show/?clearUserState=true), sharply contradicts the Trump administration’s portrayal of the immigration sweeps as an effort to fight crime and, as Trump himself has described it, targeting the “worst of the worst”.

      <source:markdown>China recently came out with its latest five-year plan for growth, which will guide the world’s second largest economy through 2030. In it, top Communist Party leaders have pushed to boost the country&#39;s strength in manufacturing to the next level by upgrading older factories with advanced technologies for automation.

The challenge, according to the Chinese ministry of education, is that the sector has tens of millions of open jobs because there aren&#39;t enough skilled workers in the labor force to fill them.

One school is trying to bridge that gap. Marketplace China correspondent Jennifer Pak visited it in Nanjing city.</source:markdown>

Also in this episode: A bitcoin downturn won’t just hurt crypto bros, Panera announces an overhaul amid floundering fast-casual sales, and the EV market soldiers on, despite sunsetted tax subsidies and emissions regulations.

On Tuesday, the Guardian published an investigation into allegations against Philadelphia Union sporting director Ernst Tanner. The story reveals that, since his arrival at the Union in 2018, Tanner’s considerable success has come with multiple allegations of misbehavior, including alleged racist, sexist and homophobic commentary toward referees and opposition players, and an allegation of unwanted touching of a Union employee that was escalated to HR.

The bulk of the allegations the Guardian is reporting on are contained in a complaint filed by the MLS Players’ Association (MLSPA) to the league. The league launched its own investigation in January which recently concluded, having not corroborated the allegations.

Responded to a referee making contact with an opposition player by saying “why don’t you kiss him, you faggot” in a manner that could be heard by nearby fans.

Made multiple misogynistic comments, including saying “women don’t belong in men’s soccer” about a female MLS referee and telling a gathering of academy players that they “should never worry about a referee, unless she’s a woman.”

Spoke about Black players “like they were subhuman” and suggested that Black referees “lack intelligence and capability.”

Touched a co-worker inappropriately “numerous times,” an allegation for which he was reported to the Union’s HR department.

Hired an underqualified coach who was allegedly abusive toward players on the Philadelphia Union II, the club’s reserve team that is used as a proving ground for young players from its thriving academy.

      <source:markdown>Philadelphia Union sporting director Ernst Tanner denies the allegations, which prompted a recently-concluded MLS investigation that could not corroborate them

- [Read a summary of our investigation here](http://theguardian.com/football/2025/nov/18/ernst-tanner-major-league-soccer)


From a box above the field at PayPal Park in San Jose, Ernst Tanner looked on. It was 10 June 2023, and his Union team were losing a physical match 2-1 to the San Jose Earthquakes. Jamiro Monteiro, a player Tanner had brought to the Union in 2019 before trading him to San Jose, was being substituted. Monteiro, clearly exhausted, trudged to the Earthquakes’ bench as referee Nima Saghafi extended his arm and ushered him along, briefly making contact.

It wasn’t the first time Saghafi had touched the midfielder. In the first half, with Monteiro on the ground after being sent flying by a tackle, Saghafi placed his hand on Monteiro’s back, a small gesture meant to show concern.

Made multiple misogynistic comments, including saying “women don’t belong in men’s soccer” about a female MLS referee and telling a gathering of academy players that they “should never worry about a referee, unless she’s a woman.”

Spoke about Black players “like they were subhuman” and suggested that Black referees “lack intelligence and capability.”

Touched a co-worker inappropriately “numerous times,” an allegation for which he was reported to the Union’s HR department.

Hired an underqualified coach who was allegedly abusive toward players on the Philadelphia Union II, the club’s reserve team that is used as a proving ground for young players from its thriving academy.

      <source:markdown>Delivery company struggling to convince US chain Kroger, its most important customer, of the virtues of automation

That’s quite a stock market journey: from 180p [at listing 15 years ago](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jul/20/ocado-slash-shares-float-price) to the mighty heights of £29 during the locked-down Covid year of 2020 and now – oh dear – all the way back down to 180p. Welcome to Ocado, which looked like the future of grocery retailing once upon a time but now seems to be struggling to convince its most important customer of the virtues of robots and automation.

There is no positive gloss to put on news that Kroger, the US supermarket chain, [is closing three of its eight warehouses](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/nov/18/ocado-shares-drop-after-us-partner-announces-warehouse-closures-kroger) that use Ocado’s technology.

The archdiocese of New Orleans has begun a three-week confirmation trial that will determine whether a federal bankruptcy judge signs off on a $230m settlement meant to compensate 650 clergy abuse survivors and resolve one of the US’s longest-running and costliest church bankruptcies.

US bankruptcy judge Meredith Grabill will decide whether the plan – five and a half years in the making – is fair to the survivors and dozens of other creditors who have waited through repeated delays, contentious negotiations and a protracted legal fight over a 2021 state law giving survivors of decades-old child sexual abuse the right to sue.

The crown prince’s arrival in Washington will be his first White House visit since the 2018 killing of the Washington Post journalist and critic of the kingdom Jamal Khashoggi. The CIA [later determined](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/26/jamal-khashoggi-mohammed-bin-salman-us-report) Khashoggi’s murder was approved by the crown prince, leading to global condemnation.

      <source:markdown>The so-called Judgment Day will generate millions of dollars and attract huge ratings, but leave boxing a little more broken

The unsurprising confirmation of “a colossal global showdown” [between Jake Paul and Anthony Joshua](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/nov/12/anthony-joshua-jake-paul-december-miami-fight-netflix) arrived on Monday morning with a dull thud. That grand description of an eight-round scrap between a former YouTuber and a former world heavyweight champion was supplied by Paul’s company, Most Valuable Promotions, which also announced that the contest will be screened live on Netflix on 19 December and called Judgment Day.

Boxing operates in a netherworld that appears to have sunk far beyond any fear of judgment, while Paul has always had delusions of grandeur as a novice pro. But even boxing may have to consider its own culpability should Paul be badly hurt and end up in hospital after this fully sanctioned bout with regulation 10oz gloves is held in Miami.

The court took up the administration’s appeal of a lower court’s determination that the “metering” policy, under which US immigration officials could stop asylum seekers at the border and decline to process their claims, violated federal law.

Good morning.

Donald Trump has urged his fellow Republicans in Congress to vote for the release of files related to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, [reversing his previous resistance to such a move](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/17/trump-tells-republicans-to-vote-to-release-epstein-files-saying-we-have-nothing-to-hide).

**Why the sudden U-turn?** The House was expected to vote to release the files anyway, as early as tomorrow. There has been fervent suspicion within Trump’s usually loyal Maga base that the administration is hiding details of Epstein’s crimes to protect the rich elite with whom the financier associated – including Trump.

**Has Trump made up with Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has been calling for the files to be released?** No, he [doubled down on his attacks](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/nov/17/donald-trump-jeffrey-epstein-files-republicans-democrats-world-cup-us-politics-live-news-updates) against the Republican lawmaker, despite his reversal on resisting the release of the Epstein files. Greene, meanwhile, has said [she hopes they can make it up](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/16/marjorie-taylor-greene-trump-remarks).

**What does Israel’s limited data tell us about the rate of detainee casualties?** Israeli authorities only provided comprehensive data for the first eight months of the war. During this period, official figures show an unprecedented casualty rate among Palestinian detainees, on average one death every four days.

      <source:markdown>About a third of global greenhouse gas emissions come from our food systems, and livestock production is a big part of that. Experts largely agree that one of the biggest actions individuals can take to lower emissions is to eat less meat.

But that&#39;s a hard sell for a lot of consumers. Americans have actually been eating more meat in recent years, and sales of plant-based meat alternatives have dropped.

There are a lot of companies out there trying to innovate climate-friendly meat and alternatives for the future.

For our podcast &#34;How We Survive,&#34; Marketplace&#39;s Amy Scott visits a lab at Columbia University where researchers are figuring out how to make a more convincing and enjoyable fake meat.</source:markdown>

Kennedy does in the United States. Federal authorities in Mexico recently arrested a 64-year-old man in Tijuana in connection with Colosio’s killing.</source:markdown>

      <source:markdown>Reports that fire crews were ordered to leave original site of blaze prompt tough questions for city and LAFD leaders

Concerns over a small brush fire that reignited days later into the mammoth Palisades fire – the [most destructive](https://www.wildfirela.org/history/) in Los Angeles history – have grown in recent weeks amid reports that firefighters were ordered to leave the original site of the smaller blaze despite their concerns the ground was still smoldering.

Now, questions remain about how leaders at the Los Angeles fire department responded to a fire that [leveled entire communities](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/09/california-wildfires-pacific-palisades-los-angeles), and who within the agency knew about concerns the fire could still pose a threat. A former LA city councilor says the aftermath and recovery effort should serve as a Pearl Harbor moment for the city, which should never again be in a position with flames encroaching on all sides.

      <source:markdown>Experts say air traffic controllers quickly returning to work, with promise of full back pay, and even $10,000 bonus

Fears that it would take weeks or even months for flight schedules in the US to return to normal in the wake of the US federal government shutdown do not appear to be coming true and the busy upcoming holiday season should be normal for travel, experts say.

That is at least in part because air traffic controllers are quickly returning to work, according to the Department of Transportation.

Gail Etienne still remembers her first day at McDonogh 19 elementary school in New Orleans’ Lower Ninth Ward. As her family pulled up to the school in the car with the federal marshals, they saw crowds of angry people screaming. Some carried garbage cans and sticks. Others were holding picket signs against school integration.

A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from withholding federal funding and threatening hefty fines against the University of California amid the administration’s attempts to coerce elite US universities into adopting and promoting conservative ideals.

US district judge Rita Lin of San Francisco issued the preliminary injunction late Friday, saying the government was not allowed to demand payments from the California school system over the administration’s claims that it violates civil rights by allowing antisemitism and practising affirmative action.

The Trump administration’s clemency drive is coming under scrutiny after the justice department this week replaced pardons posted online that bore strikingly similar copies of Trump’s signature with others that are distinctively variable.

The corrections came after online commenters seized on the similarities in the president’s signature granting “full and unconditional” pardons to seven men, including to former New York Mets player [Darryl Strawberry](https://apnews.com/television-fc6318ff6f3d4133890956a7576999e6), former Tennessee House speaker Glen Casada and former New York police sergeant Michael McMahon, on 7 November.

      <source:markdown>- Club hope to have Frenchman in charge next weekend

- Any compensation not regarded as problematic


Celtic are to accelerate talks with Wilfried Nancy over the weekend as the Columbus Crew manager edges closer to replacing Brendan Rodgers in Glasgow. Celtic are understood to have informed the Major League Soccer side on Friday of their plans, with any compensation required to coax the Frenchman not regarded as problematic. Nancy is believed to be keen on the switch.

Celtic hope to have Nancy in place by the time they visit St Mirren next weekend, which would bring an end to Martin O’Neill’s caretaker spell. O’Neill was due to meet Celtic’s main shareholder, Dermot Desmond, in London on Friday. The second tenure of Rodgers in Glasgow [ended in acrimony](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/27/brendan-rodgers-resigns-celtic-martin-oneill) in late October, with Desmond taking public aim at the former Liverpool manager.

It was a foggy October afternoon on the central California coast when the Marine Mammal Center got a call on their public hotline: there were distressed cries coming from the frigid waters in Morro Bay.

The center’s experts were able to determine that the calls – which sounded almost like a human baby screeching – were coming from a roughly two-week-old sea otter pup that had been separated from its mother.

Good morning.

The convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein apparently served as [a behind-the-scenes adviser to the former Trump official and Maga influencer Steve Bannon](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/14/jeffrey-epstein-steve-bannon) during an August 2018 media campaign to defend Trump and his agenda, and to promote Bannon’s media ventures.

**What else has been released in the flood of recent Epstein emails?** Among many, many other things, one email shows an exchange between him and an associate in which they discuss “girls” and travel. The justice department continues to downplay the possibility that other men were involved in Epstein’s abuse of teen girls.

**What’s happening with** **rest of the Epstein files?** Trump is facing the prospect of a politically damaging congressional vote to release the files, after attempts to press two members of Congress to withdraw their backing for it appeared to have failed.

**What exactly is climate finance? Who pays it? And who gets it?** Sixteen years ago, at the climate summit in Copenhagen, rich and polluting countries pledged to provide $100bn (£76bn) each year by 2020 [so that poorer countries could cut their emissions and adapt to a hotter world](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/nov/14/what-exactly-is-climate-finance-who-pays-it-and-who-gets-it).

The development would be just the latest in a series of moves by Trump acolytes at the Department of Justice who are transforming the voting section of the agency from an office focused on protecting Americans’ voting rights to one that is in lockstep with an election denial movement that incessantly demands investigations and drastic reductions in access to the polls based on [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump)’s lies about elections.

      <source:markdown>This week we learned the Japanese investment firm Softbank sold all of its stake in the juggernaut chipmaker Nvidia. We&#39;ll get into why on today&#39;s “Marketplace Tech Bytes: Week in Review.” Plus, Apple is reportedly pushing back the release of its thinnest iPhone, the Air, and Wikipedia is asking AI companies, once again, to pay for scraping its data.

But first, back to that big move by Softbank and its CEO, Masayoshi Son. It cashed out its stake in Nvidia in October, the same month that the chipmaker hit a $5 trillion valuation. The $5.8 billion it netted will be redirected to OpenAI, part of a promised $30 billion to be invested in the maker of ChatGPT.

Marketplace’s Meghan McCarty Carino spoke with Anita Ramaswamy, columnist at The Information, about what all this means.

Democrats appear more enthusiastic than Republicans about voting in next year’s congressional elections following the party’s victories in recent state and local contests, according to a new Reuters/Ipsos poll, which showed Republican President Donald Trump’s approval steady at 40%.

Some 79% of Democrats said they would regret it if they didn’t vote in the election, compared to 68% of Republicans.

      <source:markdown>Attempts to persuade two female members of Congress to withdraw backing for petition appear to have failed – key US politics stories from Thursday 13 November at a glance

[Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump) is facing the prospect of a politically damaging congressional vote on releasing the [Jeffrey Epstein](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein) files after attempts to press two female members of Congress to withdraw their backing for it appeared to have failed.

The reported refusal of Lauren Boebert, a Republican representative from Colorado, and Nancy Mace, from South Carolina, to remove their names from a discharge petition to force a vote leaves Trump exposed on an issue that carries the possibility of turning segments of his Maga base against him.

      <source:markdown>Move escalates legal battle over a redistricting effort designed to help Democrats flip House seats in 2026

The justice department on Thursday [joined a lawsuit](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-governor-gavin-newsom-californias-race-based-redistricting-plan) brought by California Republicans to block the state’s new congressional map, escalating a legal battle over a redistricting effort designed to give Democrats a better chance of retaking the House of Representatives next year.

The lawsuit, filed in federal court in California, challenges the congressional map championed by Gavin Newsom, the state’s Democratic governor, in response to a Republican gerrymander in Texas, sought by Donald Trump.

For 16 of his last 21 years in prison, following his conviction for the murder of 19-year-old Ronnie Wipf, he has been confined, often alone, to a series of windowless concrete cells in the state penitentiary in McAlester, Oklahoma, in an underground block that prisoners have compared to a tomb.

A last-minute provision in the federal spending bill heavily restricting hemp-derived products such as CBD and THC drinks could lead some Republicans to vote against the spending bill which, if passed, could end the government shutdown as early as Wednesday.

Kentucky is one of the largest producers of hemp in the country, and Republicans in the state have shown strong support for the hemp industry. Jonathan Miller, an advocate for the hemp industry and former Kentucky state treasurer, said that “Kentucky is really ground zero for the rebirth of hemp” – a niche industry until the 2018 farm bill allowed a much wider variety of legal products.

California governor [Gavin Newsom](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/gavin-newsom) has said [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump) is an “invasive species” whose dismissal of the climate crisis is an “abomination”, in a fiery attack at the UN climate talks in Brazil – from which Trump and his administration have been completely absent.

The judge, Dianna Gibson, [ruled just before a midnight deadline](http://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/document-2025-11-10T234354.061.pdf) on Monday that a revised map submitted by the Republican-controlled state legislature “unduly favors Republicans and disfavors Democrats”, throwing out lawmakers’ second attempt to draw districts.

The Israeli embassy in Washington has been circulating a letter on Capitol Hill defending its nine-month detention of a 16-year-old US citizen in military prison as pressure mounts from senators and civil society groups who have called for his release.

The document, obtained by the Guardian, describes Israel’s allegations against Mohammed Ibrahim and the medical treatment he has allegedly received in prison. It does not mention his dramatic weight loss or the fact that his family has had virtually no contact with him since his arrest in February.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) does not plan to resume its “wild to mild” flu vaccination campaign, which was halted in the midst of the record-breaking flu season.

Good morning.

Donald Trump has threatened legal action against the BBC and [welcomed the resignations of two of its most senior figures](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/10/trump-bbc-legal-action) after a campaign against the UK’s public broadcaster peaked over the criticism that a 2024 documentary used a misleading edit of a Trump speech on the day of the January 6 insurrection.

**Why did the BBC’s director general and News CEO resign?** They did so after the rightwing Telegraph newspaper published a leaked internal report by a former BBC standards adviser alleging failings in the broadcaster’s coverage.

**What did the documentary show?** Trump’s speech was edited to put together two sentences that were actually 54 minutes apart, splicing him [telling supporters to walk to the US capitol](https://www.theguardian.com/media/video/2025/nov/10/side-by-side-comparison-of-bbc-edited-trump-speech-from-day-of-capitol-attack-with-original-video) and then to “fight like hell”.

**So Trump didn’t tell people to “fight”?** No, he absolutely did, many times. According to the January 6 select committee [report](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Final_Report_of_the_Select_Committee_to_Investigate_the_January_6th_Attack_on_the_United_States_Capitol), “he spent the next 50-or-so minutes amping up his crowd with lies about the election, attacking his own vice-president and Republican members of Congress, and [exhorting the crowd to fight](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/10/why-bbc-resignations-trump-speech-edit)”.

**Why is Trump doing this?** The development “is only the latest chapter in a campaign meant to keep media institutions that cover Trump on their toes,” writes the [Guardian US media correspondent, Jeremy Barr](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/11/trump-bbc-lawsuit-threat-media-attacks).

**What are the spyware companies?** Paragon Solutions, which makes a spyware called Graphite; and NSO Group, which the Biden administration had in 2021 accused of engaging in business “contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the US”. Paragon made a deal the Trump administration in September to provide services to immigration agents.

      <source:markdown>Weston McKennie remains at Juventus due to a manager change, and the US remain vulnerable to outside elements

When Weston McKennie signed for Juventus in 2020, it had only been 30 days since Andrea Pirlo was made the Italian club’s manager. A few weeks ago, Luciano Spalletti was appointed as Juve’s fifth manager since McKennie joined – or [his seventh, if you count the interim head coaches](https://www.transfermarkt.us/juventus-fc/mitarbeiterhistorie/verein/506). It’s not a new situation for the American. But according to US men’s national team head coach Mauricio Pochettino, it’s why McKennie isn’t with the US during their upcoming friendlies with Paraguay on Saturday and Uruguay on Tuesday.

Pochettino could have selected McKennie, trusting that Spalletti is the first Juventus manager in years to be instantly convinced of the multifunctional Texan’s value. Rather than the usual routine of a manager trying to push McKennie out of the club, only to realize that there’s a reason [only three players in the squad](https://www.transfermarkt.us/juventus-fc/kader/verein/506/saison_id/2025/plus/1) have been at the club longer, Spalletti has given McKennie starts in all three matches he’s overseen. The 27-year-old has played all but five available minutes in that span.
