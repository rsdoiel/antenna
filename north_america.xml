Californians headed to the polls on Tuesday to decide on Proposition 50, a ballot measure of national significance that could play a major role in determining which party controls the [US House of Representatives](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/house-of-representatives) after the 2026 midterms.

If voters approve the proposal, the state will halt the work of its independent redistricting commission and allow the legislature to redraw congressional districts to carve out five additional Democratic congressional seats.

A [Pennsylvania](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pennsylvania) artist’s efforts to create a Halloween float for a local Catholic school went awry when he inadvertently included a replica of the gateway arch from a Nazi concentration camp, prompting a hasty apology from the diocese of Harrisburg.

In apologizing for the fiasco, Galen Shelly [told PennLive](https://www.pennlive.com/news/2025/11/holocaust-imagery-on-halloween-parade-float-designer-apologizes-for-mistake.html) that a lighted archway and lanterns he ordered to decorate a parade float he was building for Hanover’s St Joseph’s school did not arrive in time – so he searched the internet for images of cemetery gates to represent the idea that “none of us get out of this life alive”.

A state court in Nashville on Monday heard a legal challenge by some Democratic elected officials to [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump)’s deployment of the national guard into the streets of [Memphis](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/memphis), notable in part because of who has not raised an objection: the city of Memphis itself.

Shelby county’s mayor, Lee Harris, led the lawsuit, along with state representatives Gabby Salinas and GA Hardaway, both Memphis Democrats. Other state and local leaders joined the suit, including one Memphis city council member. The ACLU later filed briefs in support of the suit seeking an injunction to block the deployment of troops.

Altering the maps in the GOP’s favor would make it even harder for Democrats to take back control of Congress in the midterm elections next year.

Good morning.

The Trump administration said it would provide only partial relief to recipients of food stamps on Monday, amid mounting uncertainty among the nearly 42 million people on the supplemental nutrition assistance program (Snap).

**How did we get here?** As a result of the shutdown, Donald Trump has threatened to cut off the food benefits for the first time in the program’s more than 60-year history. A federal judge last week prevented the Department of Agriculture from [suspending](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/31/judge-blocks-trump-snap-suspension) Snap altogether.

**What impact will it have?** There have already been long lines at food banks across the nation. Chris Stein [spoke to people](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/03/trump-snap-benefits-reactions) affected, with many saying they would have to scrimp on food to get by. “I’m dumbfounded by the cruelty,” one said.

**Can Trump even do that?** The president does not directly determine how much money any city receives from the federal government; appropriation is the constitutional function of Congress. But control over how money is spent – or withheld in acts of impoundment, which are forbidden under federal law – has become a point of [legal contention](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/03/trump-mamdani-new-york-election-mayor-cuomo).

**What do New York polls say?** A recent survey from [AtlasIntel](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/polls/nyc-mayoral-election-polls-2025.html) showed Mamdani, the Democratic nominee, on 44%, the independent Andrew Cuomo on 39% and the Republican Curtis Sliwa on 16%.

      <source:markdown>Veterans groups say recent Washington Post stories on VA disability payments paint a misleading picture. The paper stands by its reporting

In October, the [Washington Post](https://www.theguardian.com/media/washington-post) reported that it had uncovered “rampant exaggeration and fraud” in the US Department of Veterans Affairs’ disability benefits system.

“Military veterans are swamping the US government with dubious disability claims … exploiting the country’s sacred commitment to compensate those harmed in the line of duty,” the newspaper [reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/interactive/2025/veterans-affairs-disability-claims-fraud/).

One year after [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump) won his way back into the White House, voters are going back to the ballot box in a test of the president’s popularity and whether Democrats are able to rebound from their catastrophic losses of 2024.

With governor’s mansions, mayoral offices, statehouses and mid-cycle redistricting on the line in closely watched contests from Trenton, New Jersey and Richmond, Virginia to New York City and beyond, the party is pinning its hopes on locally rooted campaigns aiming to blunt a national conservative message that has surged in recent years.

Andrew Wiggins was among the first superstar prospects of the social media era. Born in Thornhill, Ontario just north of Toronto, Wiggins was known internationally by the time he was 13. It wasn’t always easy for the shy, small-town kid to embrace the spotlight.

After just one full season at Vaughan, Wiggins needed better competition than Canada could provide and moved on to Huntington Prep in Huntington, West Virginia — a relatively new prep school set in a small, blue-collar, sports-oriented college town near Kansas.

Senate [Republicans](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans) shot down a Democratic-led attempt to fully fund Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap) benefits on Monday during the government shutdown – a move that heightens uncertainty for the 42 million Americans participating in the country’s biggest anti-hunger program.

Jeff Merkley, a Democratic senator, and Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader, attempted to pass a [resolution](https://www.merkley.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/Merkley-Schumer-SNAP-Resolution.pdf) via unanimous consent that would have forced the Department of Agriculture to fund Snap benefits for the month of November.

      <source:markdown>Trump administration says in court filing it plans to use emergency funds to partially cover November Snap benefits for millions of Americans

- [Trump administration will provide half of usual funds to Snap recipients in November](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/03/trump-partially-fund-food-stamps-snap)


Looking ahead, on Wednesday, **the supreme court will hear arguments on whether Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs on dozens of countries are legal.** It’s set to be one of the most consequential rulings on the expanse of Trump’s presidential power in his second term.

My colleague, **Eduardo Porter**, has this helpful breakdown on the question at the heart of this case. A dozen states have challenged the president’s contention that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) of 1977 gives him the power to impose tariffs on imports from every country in the world to defend the nation from a several “threats” facing the US.

Justices will focus much of their attention on whether IEEPA authorizes the president to [levy a tariff](https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/court-filings/state-of-oregon-et-al-v-donald-j-trump-united-states-department-of-homeland-security-et-al-complaint-2025.pdf) – a word that is not mentioned in the text of the law and is, moreover, a form of taxation, over which, per the constitution, Congress has exclusive power.

IEEPA [gives the president](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1701) authority “to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States, if the president declares a national emergency with respect to such threat”.

Throwing a sandwich at a federal agent turned Sean Charles Dunn into a symbol of resistance against [Donald Trump’s](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump) law-enforcement surge in the nation’s capital. This week, federal prosecutors are trying to persuade a jury of fellow Washington DC residents that Dunn simply broke the law.

That could be a tough sell for the government in a city that has chafed against Trump’s federal takeover, which is entering its third month. A grand jury refused to indict Dunn on a felony assault count before the office of Jeanine Pirro, a US attorney, opted to charge him instead with a misdemeanor.

Washington Commanders head coach Dan Quinn has accepted he shares some of the blame for a serious injury to the team’s quarterback, Jayden Daniels.

Daniels, who had [one of the greatest rookie campaigns](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jan/21/can-jayden-daniels-and-the-commanders-continue-their-fairytale-playoff-run) of all time last season, suffered a dislocated left elbow in Sunday’s loss to the Seattle Seahawks.

**How have Trump’s policies affected the figures?** Donald Trump’s “one big, beautiful bill”, passed by Congress in May, has been one of the “single largest transfers of wealth upwards in decades”, according to the report, by cutting tax for the wealthy and corporations.

**How does it work?** The system, which launched more than a year ago, rewards soldiers who achieve strikes with points that can be exchanged to buy more weapons in an “Amazon-for-war” online store called Brave1 filled with more than 100 different drones, autonomous vehicles and other drone war material.

There is an air of calm surrounding Amanda Anisimova when she speaks; a palpable sense of her comfort in her own skin.

In a sport like tennis that can swing its protagonists from one emotional extreme to another, week in, week out, Anisimova has worked hard to value the highs, the lows, and the moments in between, all while staying true to herself.

The first time the Blue Jays won a World Series, in 1992, the team’s victory parade was held on the same day as a contentious national referendum. At play that day was a suite of potential constitutional changes that had Canadians, living through a period of economic strain, regional tension, and a growing distrust of political elites, questioning what kind of country they were living in. The referendum failed and paved the way for another, three years later, in 1995, that almost saw Quebec leave Canada altogether. Following the win, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney congratulated the Jays noting that, beyond it being a “historic victory” the team’s playoff run “united a nation behind you, capturing the imagination of Canadians from coast to coast.” It was something Canada needed.

This time there was no parade. The Jays lost 5-4 to the LA Dodgers in the early hours of Sunday in [a heartbreaking Game 7](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/nov/02/dodgers-win-world-series-game-7-blue-jays-baseball), missing out on their first World Series title in 32 years.

If five wins from the seven turf events, one short of the record, felt like a standard return for European runners at the 2025 Breeders’ Cup at Del Mar, then the identity of the biggest winner of all was a huge, and very refreshing, surprise.

Willie Mullins blew into Del Mar with Ethical Diamond, his first ever runner at the meeting, and [left with the $2m first prize in the Turf](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2025/nov/01/breeders-cup-2025-day-two-live), nearly five times as much as he banked when Nick Rockett landed the Grand National in April. And the style of his win was equally memorable. Punters who backed the proven Group One form of Minnie Hauk and Rebel’s Romance might beg to differ, but it gladdened the heart to see an [Ebor Handicap winner](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/aug/23/ethical-diamond-shines-bright-to-hand-william-buick-a-first-success-in-the-ebor) leave the pair of them standing with a stretch run for the ages.

She remembers years of streets brimming with families and children, with street vendors selling food and cempasúchil, the marigolds that loved ones place on altars for Day of the Dead – or Día de los Muertos – from 1 to 2 November.

A unicorn led off the game with a single and then trotted out to the mound to pitch the bottom of the first. Another pitcher won Games 2, 6, and 7 of the World Series, throwing 17.2 innings along the way. A catcher set a record, squatting behind the plate for 74 Fall Classic frames and ultimately ended the series by hitting the final go-ahead home run.

Just as everyone feared or sneered, the Los Angeles Dodgers are champions. Again. In what some forecasted as a harbinger of doom, the sinister strategy of employing the best baseball player on the planet along with a generous number of his nearly equal peers proved effective. _It’s not fair,_ some people will say in the coming months about the fact that the team broadly believed to be the best ultimately won it all.

A shrill call was followed by a flash of movement through a pile of boulders on a high country slope in Yosemite national park. “Hello, Sophie!” Beth Pratt responded to the round, feisty pika who had briefly emerged to pose defiantly in the sun.

- Smith’s 11th-inning home run breaks deadlock

- LA clinch first repeat championship since 2000


**Dodgers 0-0 Blue Jays, end of first inning**

A bit of confusion here. Ohtani takes the mound a bit late and has yet to throw a warm-up pitch at the time the Blue Jays are ready to bat. The home-play umpire is giving him a little extra time.

George Springer takes three straight balls from Ohtani before taking a strike. The Toronto DH, back from an oblique injury, then rips a line drive to left field for a leadoff single. The crowd explodes.

Nathan Lukes goes down 1-2 in the count and fights off a few more pitches before striking out swinging on a splitter.

Vladimir Guerrero Jr works the count to 3-2, then takes a 100mph fastball right down the middle for a called strikeout ... before catcher Will Smith fires down to second to catch Springer stealing. The strikeout double play abruptly ends the inning. Both teams get leadoff hits in the first inning but neither can take advantage.

Ohtani takes two balls, fouls off a cutter, then singles to right-field off a changeup.

Will Smith grounds out to first base, making the first out but moving Ohtani into scoring position.

Freeman jumps on the first pitch and flies out to center for the second out, but Ohtani tags up and takes third.

Betts takes a ball, then grounds out to short to roars from the Rogers Centre crowd. It’s a scoreless first inning for Scherzer.

Westwood is located in west Denver, a lower-income part of the city; median family income in the surrounding area is less than $43,000 a year, according to census data.

Against that backdrop, New York has seen a mayoral election that has pitted two very different Democrats against one another. The race has become an increasingly bitter face-off, laced with alleged racism and Islamophobia, but it is the political differences between the two main candidates that could have major implications for how the Democratic party performs in next year’s midterm elections.

Waves of hungry Angelenos gathered outside Community Space food bank’s storefront on a recent afternoon, grabbing dry goods like pastries, bagels, lentils and pasta along with refrigerated salads and frozen bags of brisket.

The Los Angeles Dodgers stayed alive on Friday night, getting to Toronto Blue Jays ace Kevin Gausman for three runs in the third inning to win 3-1 and even the World Series at three games apiece. Baseball fans around the world will be treated to a winner-take-all Game 7 on Saturday, with the Dodgers looking to become the first team to win consecutive titles since 2000. The Blue Jays, meanwhile, will try to play spoiler and complete the upset to win their first World Series since 1993.

But it failed, as the Dodgers [managed just four hits](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/29/blue-jays-yesavage-dodgers-game-5-report-world-series) and one run against Blue Jays rookie Trey Yesavage and his bullpen. Roberts made a couple more minor changes before Game 6, however, inserting steely veteran Miguel Rojas into the lineup at second base and batting ninth while pushing Tommy Edman to center field and hitting eighth, hoping to get more out of the bottom of his lineup. “I just felt, again, the net sum of having both those guys in there, that’s how we had to construct it, and I feel great about it,” Roberts said before the game.

It has been a giddy, glorious and occasionally bumpy ride, but this time, it seems, Frankie Dettori’s mind is made up. The most storied jockey of the past 40 years will effectively head into retirement after the main card at the Breeders’ Cup at Del Mar on Saturday, when he will have three chances to add a farewell Grade One winner to nearly 300 on his record already. Racing may not see a career quite like it again.

Alongside Lester Piggott and perhaps John McCririck over the past half-century, “Frankie” registers with pretty much everyone, no surname required.

My beloved friend Pancho is an off-track thoroughbred who has been with me for 24 years. In his youth, in the early 2000s, he soldiered through a vigorous mid-level career on the competitive tracks of Southern California. At nearly 28 now his life is approaching its natural end. Our life together riding trails has been the purest gift. But his slow decline forces me to face the unsettling possibility of euthanasia. It’s a decision that haunts me constantly, like a whispering djinn. Some days are good, some are not. Though I dread the day I may walk into the barn and he lets me know he needs my help to die I am consoled only by the dignity of his life. He’s privileged where many thoroughbreds of his day and thousands since were not. As it was back then, as it is now and will continue to be, for the young racehorse who dies on the track there is no dignity in the end.

As thoughts of Pancho’s creeping decline weighed on me, I took a job at a large equine hospital to fill gaps in my knowledge and learn how best to care for him as health problems arise. But after a while I admitted to myself that the more sincere reason I am there is to observe other horses die. It may sound dark or morbid, but it hardly compares with the deaths I’ve witnessed before: young racehorses with shattered legs or hearts that burst mid-stride, collapsing before an audience in the name of sport.

      <source:markdown>Uncertainty surrounds the signing of this week’s trade deals amid the failure to secure reciprocity from the US to cut tariffs

On Donald Trump’s whirlwind tour of Asia – [which involved stops in Malaysia, Japan and Korea](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/24/trump-asia-tour-key-questions-xi-jinping-china-japan-south-korea-malaysia) – the US president triumphantly collected new trade deals from countries hoping for a reduction in the tariffs he slapped on them earlier this year.

However – China aside – analysts were left asking just how much Asian nations got out of it.

      <source:markdown>Vote passes 51-47 in latest bipartisan effort to end tariffs, after resolutions on repealing Canada and Brazil tariffs passed earlier this week

- [US government shutdown: tell us how it could affect your access to food or health insurance](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/30/us-government-shutdown-snap-health-insurance)


In the days leading up to the Trump-Xi meeting, American officials signalled that the US president did not intend to make good on a recent threat to impose an additional 100% import tax on Chinese goods.

Also that China had shown signs it is willing to relax its export controls on rare earths as well as revive buying soybeans from the US.

The relationship with China is very good.

Because of the tremendous destructive power, I HATED to do it, but had no choice! Russia is second, and China is a distant third, but will be even within 5 years.

Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis. That process will begin immediately.

Aidan O’Brien’s gallop towards an extension of his record for Group One wins in a season has slowed a little in recent weeks, but there was still a shield-beating sense of theatre about the scene as his team for the 2025 Breeders’ Cup meeting at Del Mar this weekend made its way to the track for morning exercise on Wednesday.

Unlike 2024, when City Of Troy was being aimed at the Classic, there is no obvious headliner in the O’Brien lineup, but plenty of the horses trotting past in a well-ordered single file have banked at least one Group One already this season and four are expected to set off as favourite.

More than 40 million Americans will stop receiving food stamps on 1 November, as the US government shutdown enters its fifth week.

The Department of Agriculture says the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap) will be suspended until Congress reopens the government. While the Trump administration argues the department does not have the legal authority to use a $5bn contingency fund to continue the aid, Democrats disagree, and two dozen states [have sued](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/28/food-stamps-lawsuit-states-sue-trump-administration) the government to force the program to continue.

When Donald Trump launched his trade war against China in April, threatening tariffs as high as 145%, the Chinese government said it would never bow to blackmail and vowed to “fight to the end”.

The question now is whether the [consensus reached between Trump and Xi Jinping](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/30/trump-and-xi-meet-in-south-korea-for-crunch-talks-on-trade) in Busan, South Korea, on Thursday means that the fight really has come to an end, and if so on whose terms.

Good morning.

Donald Trump has said that [Washington and Beijing have settled their dispute over rare earths](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/30/trump-and-xi-meet-in-south-korea-for-crunch-talks-on-trade) after crucial trade talks with the Chinese president in South Korea.

**What else was agreed?** Trump said China would axe its restrictions on rare earth exports, in a deal he said would last one year before being negotiated annually, and also buy US soya beans.

**Was Taiwan discussed?** No. And while Ukraine was discussed, Trump said that the topic of Chinese use of Russian oil was not really discussed.

**When did the U** **S** **last hold a full nuclear weapons test?** In 1992 – and neither China nor Russia are known to have held any such tests since the same period. It is unclear what weapons testing could take place.

In the first, an impressive Portugal [broke down the Americans](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/23/uswnt-portugal-friendly-alex-morgan-farewell) in a 2-1 win for the visitors. Emma Hayes played an almost entirely different, much younger lineup in the rematch, and the Americans returned the favor, 3-1. A somehow even younger lineup in the third game [steamrolled a limp New Zealand](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/29/uswnt-emma-sears-hat-trick-new-zealand-friendly), 6-0. The Portugal games offered many lessons; the Football Ferns were less scary than 11 jack-o’-lanterns would be, so that third match was more of a fun romp than a true test.

Here are some takeaways from the window:

Ghosts and goblins might not be the only scary things popping up this Halloween. Prices for the holiday’s most popular candy treats are rising, spooked by Donald Trump’s tariffs and climate change.

Candy prices are estimated to increase by 10.8% this year, according to [new analysis](https://tcf.org/content/commentary/tricks-treats-and-tariffs-how-trump-is-making-halloween-more-expensive/) from progressive groups the Century Foundation and the Groundwork Collaborative, with some popular chocolate-based treats seeing price upticks of at least 20%.

      <source:markdown>Guardian analysis finds ICE increasingly keeps people in holding rooms with little oversight, as some facilities see a 600% rise in detention length

[US immigration](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usimmigration) officials have been increasingly detaining people in small, secretive holding facilities for days or even weeks at a time in violation of federal policy, a Guardian investigation has found.

These holding facilities – located at ICE offices, in federal buildings and other locations around the country – are typically used to detain people after they have been arrested but before they are transferred or released. In many cases, they consist of small concrete rooms with no beds and are designed to only be used for a few hours.

ICE has used at least 170 ICE holding facilities nationwide, including at 25 ICE field offices.

The Trump administration and its campaign of mass deportation has led to a near across the board increase in the time people are forced to spend in detention in holding rooms. After Donald Trump’s inauguration, the average time that people spend in detention increased at 127 hold rooms across the country.

Despite ICE’s rule change in June, the agency is continuing to violate its own policy by detaining people at these sites for multiple days at a time.

In some cases, such as a New York City holding facility located on the 10th floor of a federal building in downtown Manhattan, time in detention increased by nearly 600% on average after the June rule change.

In one case the Guardian discovered by looking through agency data, ICE documented that a 62-year-old man was held inside that same New York City holding facility for two and a half months.

The Guardian also found an additional 63 people at the site who were held there for longer than one week, between Trump’s inauguration and late July.

A handful of door-knockers ran into an apartment building to escape the rain, joining Omar Fateh, the mayoral hopeful sometimes dubbed the “Mamdani of Minneapolis”.

In [a letter](https://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/102528_Department-of-Justice.pdf) this morning, James Comer, the House oversight chair, has asked the justice department to investigate whether Joe Biden’s aides improperly used an autopen to sign executive actions, claiming the former president’s inner circle concealed his cognitive decline while exercising presidential authority without authorization.

“While President Biden’s deterioration was evident to the American people, and consequently, robust systems should have been put in place to document executive actions reflected the actual will of the president, the President’s inner circle took no action to establish such a record,” Comer wrote in the letter.

      <source:markdown>- USMNT midfielder has struggled with injuries for years

A World Cup on US soil next year is a guiding light for the 22-year-old Reyna to revive a career dogged by injuries.

Marcus Allen knew, and tried to help. So did Howie Long. But many of Todd Marinovich’s teammates on the Los Angeles Raiders of the early 1990s had no idea their young quarterback was using drugs.

Marinovich had come to the Raiders from USC, where he had guided the Trojans to a Rose Bowl victory as a freshman. By that time, he had accumulated two nicknames: “Robo Quarterback,” after the legendarily demanding training regimen instilled by his father, former Raiders player and assistant coach Marv Marinovich, intended to foster excellence in athletes. The other nickname was far more unflattering: “Marijuana-vich,” for his pot-smoking, which became a taunt from opposing fans in high school.

      <source:markdown>- Dodgers win in 18, tying longest World Series game

- Ohtani reaches base postseason-record nine times

- LA lead 2-1 in series ahead of Tuesday’s Game 4


It took Freddie Freeman three chances to get it just right.

When the Los Angeles Dodgers first baseman drove a fastball deep into centerfield in the bottom of the 13th inning, the home fans at Dodger Stadium groaned as the ball nestled into Toronto Blue Jays centerfielder Daulton Varsho’s glove to make Game 3 of the 2025 World Series just the fifth World Series game to ever reach the 14th inning. Two innings later, Freeman hit the ball even harder, but not quite high enough as Varsho chased it down before it could reach the centerfield wall.

[Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump) said on Monday morning that he would rule out running for the vice-presidency in the 2028 US election, an unorthodox approach that some of his supporters have floated to allow the Republican US president to serve a third term in the White House.

A faltering federal response to one of the worst storms in [Alaska](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/alaska)’s history, which caused hundreds of people to become homeless, is drawing further scrutiny over the [Trump administration](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration)’s efforts to dismantle federal weather and climate protections.

Good morning.

The US and China have [agreed a framework for a trade deal](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/27/us-china-framework-trade-deal-xi-trump-meeting) only days before Donald Trump and the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, are due to meet.

**What about other trade deals that are still up in the air?** There were hopes of a truce between the US and Brazil after what President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva described as a positive meeting with Trump in Malaysia. He said their respective teams would start discussing tariffs and other matters “immediately”.

**And Canada?** Trump said Saturday that he would [raise US tariffs by 10%](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/25/trump-tariffs-canada-ronald-reagan) in retaliation for an [advertisement](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/24/trump-canada-trade-negotations-ontario-tariffs) sponsored by the Ontario government that accurately quoted Ronald Reagan at length saying tariffs don’t work.

**How many people have been killed in the airstrikes?** US forces in recent weeks have carried out at least eight strikes against boats in the Caribbean off Venezuela’s coast, killing about 40 people that the Trump administration has insisted were involved in smuggling drugs.

It was the first time in his career that he played against Green Bay, where he spent nearly two decades, won four MVPs [and a lone Super Bowl](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/feb/07/super-bowl-green-bay-packers-pittsburgh-steelers).
