It took Freddie Freeman three chances to get it just right.

When the Los Angeles Dodgers first baseman drove a fastball deep into centerfield in the bottom of the 13th inning, the home fans at Dodger Stadium groaned as the ball nestled into Toronto Blue Jays centerfielder Daulton Varsho’s glove to make Game 3 of the 2025 World Series just the fifth World Series game to ever reach the 14th inning. Two innings later, Freeman hit the ball even harder, but not quite high enough as Varsho chased it down before it could reach the centerfield wall.

A faltering federal response to one of the worst storms in [Alaska](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/alaska)’s history, which caused hundreds of people to become homeless, is drawing further scrutiny over the [Trump administration](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration)’s efforts to dismantle federal weather and climate protections.

[The powerful remnants of Typhoon Halong hit remote communities](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/15/alaska-typhoon-halong-aftermath) in the Yukon-Kuskokwim delta of south-west Alaska on 12 October, inundating a vast low-lying area of tundra that is home to some of the most remote and inaccessible communities in the country.

Good morning.

The US and China have [agreed a framework for a trade deal](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/27/us-china-framework-trade-deal-xi-trump-meeting) only days before Donald Trump and the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, are due to meet.

**What about other trade deals that are still up in the air?** There were hopes of a truce between the US and Brazil after what President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva described as a positive meeting with Trump in Malaysia. He said their respective teams would start discussing tariffs and other matters “immediately”.

**And Canada?** Trump said Saturday that he would [raise US tariffs by 10%](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/25/trump-tariffs-canada-ronald-reagan) in retaliation for an [advertisement](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/24/trump-canada-trade-negotations-ontario-tariffs) sponsored by the Ontario government that accurately quoted Ronald Reagan at length saying tariffs don’t work.

**How many people have been killed in the airstrikes?** US forces in recent weeks have carried out at least eight strikes against boats in the Caribbean off Venezuela’s coast, killing about 40 people that the Trump administration has insisted were involved in smuggling drugs.

It all started so well. And then it fell apart.

For two quarters, it looked like Aaron Rodgers might conjure one of those nights, the sort that ends with a smirk, a wink, and a reminder that he can match any of the league’s young pups. It was the first time in his career that he played against Green Bay, where he spent nearly two decades, won four MVPs [and a lone Super Bowl](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/feb/07/super-bowl-green-bay-packers-pittsburgh-steelers). But the NFL rarely cares for nostalgia.

The NBA scoreboard has turned into a stock ticker. Crowd chants, but half of them are watching their parlays instead of the play. Somewhere a coach calls timeout; somewhere else a bookmaker grins.

Former player and assistant coach Damon Jones, [who allegedly provided](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/46700252/source-bettors-got-privileged-injury-info-lebron-james) “inside information” about NBA games to bettors, was also taken into custody.
