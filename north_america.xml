With subsidies for Affordable Care Act (ACA) health insurance set to expire, Americans who rely on them will probably switch to plans with lower monthly premiums and high deductibles or decide not to purchase any coverage, which will have a serious and damaging impact on the entire sector, according to healthcare policy experts.

The average amount ACA plan enrollees pay annually for premiums is estimated to more than double, from an average of $888 this year to $1,904 in 2026, according to a [KFF analysis](https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/aca-marketplace-premium-payments-would-more-than-double-on-average-next-year-if-enhanced-premium-tax-credits-expire/).

      <source:markdown>With cheap drinks and friendly locals, Jimmy’s Corner is a New York institution. But a real-estate developer has ordered its closure – can it survive?

Founded by Jimmy Glenn, a former boxer turned trainer, in 1971, Jimmy’s Corner has stood, defiantly unchanged, as Times Square has boomed around it.

The neighborhood bar, a New York City institution which attracts locals and tourists alike, has had the same pictures on the walls for decades – some of the bar’s regulars have been coming almost as long – kept the same furniture, and maintained remarkably low pricing. In a perhaps unintentional nod to its history, there is also several years’ accumulation of dust in some areas.

**On Sunday morning, police said a person of interest was in custody.** Providence police chief Col Oscar Perez said the person was in their 30s but declined to say where the arrest was made and whether the person was connected to the university.

**Brown University president Christina Paxson confirmed that the two people killed were students**. Providence Mayor Brett Smiley said a shelter-in-place was in effect for the area and encouraged people living near the campus to stay inside and not to return home until it was lifted. The shelter in place order was lifted on Sunday morning.

**Eight people with gunshot wounds were taken to Rhode Island hospital**, where seven were in critical but stable condition, Brown University president Christina Paxson said on Sunday. One person remains in a critical condition, she added. One student was discharged from hospital on Saturday night and left with their parents.

**Police released footage of the man they suspected to be behind the shooting late on Saturday**, adding that some witnesses reported that the man, who could be in his 30s, may have been wearing a camouflage mask. The shooting happened inside a classroom.

**Law enforcement officers were seen at a hotel a short drive away from Brown University on Sunday morning.** An FBI agent told the Associated Press that the person of interest was detained at a Hampton Inn hotel in Coventry, about 20 miles (32 km) from Providence. Officers remained on the scene there, with police tape blocking off a hallway.

**University officials initially told students and staff that a suspect was in custody, before later saying that was not the case and that police were still searching for a suspect or suspects**. The mayor said a person preliminarily thought to be involved was detained but was later determined to have no involvement.

Nearly a year after a [mammoth wildfire](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california-wildfires) tore through Pacific Palisades, leveling 7,000 structures and leaving many displaced, some residents watched as the mayor of [Los Angeles](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/los-angeles) hailed a “major milestone” in the effort to recover.

      <source:markdown>Analysts say benefits could be felt in under-resourced rural hospitals but warn against AI as a cost-cutting measure

For states to receive certain funding stipulated in the Trump administration’s “big, beautiful” bill, they must meet three of 10 criteria – including integrating more artificial intelligence ( [AI](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/artificialintelligenceai)) technology in [healthcare](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/healthcare) settings – which experts say could have major benefits and liabilities for under-resourced hospitals, depending on how it’s implemented.

The Minnesota Wild made an all-in move for one of the NHL’s best players in his prime, acquiring defenseman Quinn Hughes from the Vancouver Canucks in a blockbuster trade – their boldest action yet toward ending a decade-long skid of playoff series defeats.

The teams announced the seismic move on Friday night, after the 2024 Norris Trophy winner as the league’s top defenseman had been the most talked-about trade candidate over the past couple of weeks. Minnesota sent center Marco Rossi, defenseman Zeev Buium, winger Liam Ohgren and a first-round pick in the 2026 draft to suddenly rebuilding Vancouver to complete the deal.

- Aicher edges ageless American star by 0.24sec

- Vonn remains atop downhill standings after two races


At 41, Lindsey Vonn is no longer defying expectations so much as resetting them. One day after becoming [the oldest woman to win a World Cup race](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/12/lindsey-vonn-comeback-world-cup-ski-victory-aged-41), the American came within a quarter-second of doing it again, finishing second in Saturday’s downhill at St Moritz behind Germany’s Emma Aicher.

Less than 24 hours after rewriting the World Cup age record, Vonn briefly looked on course for another victory as she surged ahead of Italy’s Sofia Goggia on the sunlit Corviglia course. But Aicher, skiing immediately after her, attacked the increasingly rutted track and edged Vonn by 0.24 seconds to deny her a rare opening-weekend double.

      <source:markdown>With Trump championing Pete Rose and pressuring MLB’s commissioner, the Hall of Fame vote became a referendum on power, memory and whether integrity still matters

Since mid-May, when Major League Baseball commissioner Rob Manfred announced Pete Rose [would be eligible for Hall of Fame consideration](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/may/15/pete-rose-hall-of-fame-baseball) and [explained his specious reasonings behind it](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jun/05/mlb-commissioner-manfred-admits-he-paid-attention-to-trump-when-overturning-pete-rose-ban), last week’s Hall of Fame vote by the 16-member Classic Era committee carried with it a certain air of inevitability for Roger Clemens and Barry Bonds, the two greatest players currently not enshrined in Cooperstown.

Rose was championed by Donald Trump, who used his populism to demand the Hit King finally be allowed into the Hall, an honor denied Rose since 1989 when baseball placed him on the permanently ineligible list for betting on games when he managed the Cincinnati Reds. After Rose [died in September 2024](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/sep/30/pete-rose-dies-mlb-baseball), Trump then won the presidency five weeks later and immediately increased the pressure on Manfred to end Rose’s 36-year banishment – despite the absence of any evidence suggesting Rose was any less guilty in death of gambling on the sport than he had been alive. Nevertheless, Manfred acquiesced to Trump, and in 2027, for the first time, Pete Rose will be eligible for induction into the Hall of Fame.

Ya’akub Vijandre, a Muslim photojournalist, martial arts teacher and first responder who ICE detained in October for posting on social media, told the Guardian that the government is “attacking my faith” and that he was “concerned about the safety” of his family and friends.

Minutes later, the asylum seeker from Afghanistan was cuffed and driven to a detention center.

      <source:markdown>Measure to add two GOP-friendly seats failed 19-31 after 21 Republicans joined 10 Democrats. Plus, how the Paris climate treaty changed the world

Good morning.

Indiana Republicans [rejected an effort to redraw the state’s lines](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/11/indiana-republicans-redistricting) on Thursday in a rebuke to Donald Trump and Republican efforts to add two more Republican-friendly seats to Indiana’s congressional districts.

**How might the administration react to the vote?** Heritage Action, the advocacy branch of the conservative Heritage Foundation, posted on social media: “President Trump has made it clear to Indiana leaders: if the Indiana senate fails to pass the map, all federal funding will be stripped from the state. Roads will not be paved. Guard bases will close. Major projects will stop. These are the stakes and every NO vote will be to blame.”

**What are Democrats doing on redistricting?** They’ve retaliated to the initial push by Texas to add five more likely Republican seats by redrawing maps in California.

**Has there been pushback to Trump’s escalation?** Yes – after the US seized a tanker named the Skipper off the coast of Venezuela, some US lawmakers expressed concern that Trump was [“sleepwalking us into a war with Venezuela”.](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/11/lawmakers-venezuela-oil-tanker)

The Trinity Rodman contract saga has exposed a fundamental tension at the heart of the National Women’s Soccer League: a salary-cap model built for stability and measured growth coming in collision with a global market that has accelerated far beyond it.

Rodman is one of the most important young players in US soccer, arguably its most marketable female star and a centerpiece of the NWSL’s future.

      <source:markdown>Exclusive: Congress members demand answers after Guardian revealed data to be shared for immigration enforcement

More than 50 members of Congress are demanding answers from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and homeland security officials after [the Guardian revealed](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/03/us-veterans-affairs-database-immigration) the VA is compiling a report on all non-US citizens “employed by or affiliated with” the government agency that will then be shared with other federal agencies, including immigration authorities.

The lawmakers, led by Illinois congresswoman Delia Ramirez – along with congressman Mark Takano of California and US senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, the top Democrats on the House and Senate veterans affairs committees – have written a group letter to be sent to the VA secretary, Doug Collins, and the secretary of homeland security, Kristi Noem, on Friday.

Good morning.

US forces have [seized an oil tanker](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/10/us-forces-reportedly-seize-oil-tanker-off-venezuela-coast) off the coast of Venezuela, in a major escalation of Donald Trump’s four-month pressure campaign against the South American country’s dictator, Nicolás Maduro, whose government called the seizure “an act of international piracy”.

**Where is Venezuela’s opposition leader,** **María Corina Machado** **, in all this?** The Nobel peace prize winner [greeted crowds in Oslo](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/11/maria-corina-machado-venezuela-nobel-peace-prize-winner-oslo-norway) after secretly traveling to Norway following 11 months in hiding in Caracas. She said she backs the US oil tanker seizure, calling it a crucial step to tackle what she says is Maduro’s criminal regime.

**Do we know who sent the letters?** It remains unclear – and Lau said she was told it was unlikely police would find out who was behind them.

      <source:markdown>The 2026 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) carries $8bn more than the funding Trump requested in May

The US House has approved a sweeping defence bill that bolsters Europe’s security, in what appears to be sharp rebuke to Donald Trump’s mounting threats to downgrade Washington’s ties to traditional allies and Nato.

The bipartisan vote came just days after the publication of a [White House national security strategy](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/05/civilisational-erasure-us-strategy-document-appears-to-echo-far-right-conspiracy-theories-about-europe) that said Europe faced “civilisational erasure” and made explicit Washington’s support for Europe’s nationalist far-right parties – rattling EU leaders and opening up a seismic shift in transatlantic relations.

The Fed chair, Jerome Powell, has emphasized unity within the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the board of Fed leaders that sets interest rates. But the nine-to-three vote to lower rates to a range of 3.5% to 3.75%was divisive among the committee that tends to vote in unanimity.

Residents of the Pacific north-west are preparing for a round of heavy rain on Wednesday after an atmospheric river of moisture smacked the region a day earlier with rains that triggered mudslides and washed out roads and submerged vehicles.

In Washington, rain over the state’s watersheds and mountains are causing rising rivers that could imperil homes, livestock and lives in valleys from Mount Rainier to Mount Baker, [the Seattle Times](https://www.seattletimes.com/business/real-estate/wa-homeowners-fear-property-damage-from-floods-heres-what-to-know/) reported. Rivers, including the Carbon, Cedar, Elwha and Snohomish are forecast to rise close to record heights.

      <source:markdown>- Sirianni backs Hurts amid turnover slump

- Fans booed as Eagles dropped third straight

- QB change talk ‘ridiculous’, Sirianni says


Philadelphia Eagles coach Nick Sirianni moved quickly on Wednesday to shut down the rising speculation around Jalen Hurts’ job security, calling talk of a potential quarterback change “ridiculous” despite his team’s three-game losing streak and their franchise star’s sudden dip in form.

Hurts committed five turnovers – four interceptions and a lost fumble – in [Monday night’s 22-19 defeat](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/09/eagles-chargers-monday-night-football-nfl) to the Los Angeles Chargers, punctuating one of the ugliest outings of his career. The final mistake, an interception near the goalline in overtime, sealed another deflating loss for an Eagles side that has averaged just 16 points across the past five games. The 8-5 Eagles have not won since 10 November.

      <source:markdown>Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial news, as Evoke decides to undertake a review of the Company’s strategic options

**European stock markets are mostly in the red this morning, as defence company stocks fall.**

Shares in German automotive and arms manufacturer **Rheinmetall** are down 3.3%, UK weapons maker **BAE** **System** has dropped by 1.27%, and Italian defence firm Leonardo has lost 2.2%.

Mainland European equity markets are heading lower in a day that will be dominated by monetary policy out of the Americas.

Notably, the defence sector has particularly suffered this morning, with the likes of BAE Systems, Rheinmetall, and Thales lose traction as the end of the Russia-Ukraine war comes into sight. Unfortunately for Europe, the peace agreement appears to be a deal Trump has formed with Russia behind the back of European leaders whom the President has labelled “weak”.

      <source:markdown>The FDA is reviewing RSV vaccines, which have drastically lowered infant hospitalizations, a spokesperson confirmed

US regulatory officials are re-examining the safety of RSV shots despite no published reports of safety issues – a move that could lead to the removal or limitation of shots that have dramatically lowered hospitalizations among babies.

It’s the latest move from US health officials under Robert F Kennedy Jr, the secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and a longtime anti-vaccine activist, to limit access to shots and to undermine public trust in the safe and effective products.

A senior Democratic senator is calling for an investigation into potential insider trading by fossil-fuel billionaires close to the Trump administration, after a [Guardian investigation raised questions](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/04/venture-global-shares) about an unusual share buying spree.

On a cloudy Saturday afternoon, the Los Angeles central public library bustled with nearly 100 people making zines, small, DIY magazines made out of a single piece of paper. There was folding, laughing and helping with cuts. Titles like “Narcan 101,” “Free Palestine,” and “An American Zine,” filled with illustrations and tips, lined a table down the hall.

While this may sound like a scene from the 1980s or 1990s – when zines were popular as a countercultural form of expression – this was a workshop in modern-day Los Angeles, where immigration raids and federal threats have left residents restless and scared.

      <source:markdown>Ukraine’s president to look at holding wartime vote. Plus, the hidden life of Matthew Perry

Good morning.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said he is [ready to hold a wartime election within the next three months](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/09/zelenskyy-ready-for-elections-after-trump-questions-ukrainian-democracy), if Ukraine’s parliament and foreign allies will allow it, after Donald Trump accused him of clinging on to power.

**Why hasn’t there been an election?** Zelenskyy’s five-year term expired in May last year, but the Ukrainian constitution prohibits elections during wartime, and even his political opponents have said repeatedly that the security and political considerations do not allow for holding a vote while the war continued.

**What else did he talk about?** There were familiar rally staples such as a mocking impression of Joe Biden, as well as a repeat of a racist falsehood about the Democratic congresswoman Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, a Muslim woman born in Somalia: “We ought to get her the hell out! She married her brother … Therefore she’s here illegally.” The crowd chanted: “Send her back!” Omar has called the claims about her brother “ridiculous”.

Kamala Harris lost last year’s [US presidential election](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/06/donald-trump-wins-us-presidential-election) because she chased the wrong voters with the wrong message, ultimately demobilising the very base that she needed to win, according to an autopsy by a progressive grassroots advocacy group.

The vice-president focused on courting moderate Republicans over motivating core Democratic working-class, young and progressive voters, a misstep compounded by her failure to break from Joe Biden on Gaza, says the report by [RootsAction](https://rootsaction.org/).

The draw is done. The schedule is set. For the US men’s national team, all that’s left, aside from playing the games, are the emotional highs and lows. After the draw, US head coach Mauricio Pochettino referenced a “competitive stress” factor triggered by the World Cup. He said the friendlies against Belgium and Portugal in March are intended to simulate that stress so that it doesn’t surprise his players when the spotlight of the World Cup arrives.

With the margins always thin at a World Cup, earning results that mitigate that pressure could prove to be the difference between the USMNT crashing out just when they capture the undivided attention of the nation, or enduring and soaring to a best-ever finish.

A federal judge has allowed a Tufts University student from Turkey to resume research and teaching while she deals with the consequences of having her visa revoked by the Trump administration, leading to six weeks of detention.

Rümeysa Öztürk, a PhD student studying children’s relationship to social media, was among the first people [arrested](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/26/ice-agents-detain-tufts-university-graduate-student) as the [Trump administration](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration) began targeting foreign-born students and activists involved in pro-Palestinian advocacy. She had [co-authored an op-ed](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/17/trump-rumeysa-ozturk-tufts-detention) criticizing her university’s response to Israel and the war in Gaza. Immigration enforcement officers took her away in an unmarked vehicle, in an encounter caught on video in March outside her Somerville residence.

The letter was released on Tuesday to commemorate the 68th anniversary of the founding of the civil rights division.

      <source:markdown>Three proposed casinos approved as researchers say they take money from businesses and increase addiction

New York City will probably soon see three new casinos, whose owners could rake in profits because of a recent surge in gambling in the United States that has some campaigners worried.

The [New York](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york) gaming facility location board last week approved three proposed casinos in the US’s largest city – two in Queens and one in the Bronx – after determining the businesses would create new jobs and generate billions in tax revenue, according to the [group’s report](https://nycasinos.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2025/12/12.01.25.gflbselectiondocument.pdf).

This article was amended on 9 December 2025 to correct that the New York gaming facility location board approved the casinos last week, not this week as previously stated.

Good morning.

A coalition of global civil society organizations has [downgraded the civic health rating of the US](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/09/us-civic-health-rating-trump) from “narrowed” to “obstructed”.

**What** **does it mean by “obstructed”?** Countries where civic space is heavily contested – where civil society organizations still exist but state authorities undermine them, including through illegal surveillance, bureaucratic harassment and demeaning public statements.

**What’s holding up** **the European plan?** Though a majority of EU countries support the plan, it has met strong resistance from Belgium. About £160bn ($213bn) of Russian assets are immobilised at Euroclear, a central securities depository in Brussels, and the Belgian government is concerned that it will bear liability for any seizure and face retaliation from Moscow.

Democratic representative Jasmine Crockett launched a bid for US Senate in Texas on Monday, bringing a high-profile official to a race that may be critical to Democrats’ bold ambition to reclaim a Senate majority in next year’s midterm elections.

The two-term representative of Dallas is seeking to flip the seat held by Republican John Cornyn, who is running for re-election in the GOP-dominated state.

Drinking water contaminated with [Pfas](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/pfas) chemicals probably increases the risk of infant mortality and other harm to newborns, a new peer-reviewed study of 11,000 births in New Hampshire finds.

The first-of-its-kind University of Arizona research found drinking well water down gradient from a Pfas-contaminated site was tied to an increase in infant mortality of 191%, pre-term birth of 20%, and low-weight birth of 43%.

The US supreme court on Monday appeared poised to back the Trump administration’s argument that the president should be able to fire independent board members that for almost a century have been protected from presidential interference.

The court heard arguments concerning the legality of [Donald Trump’s](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump) firing of a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) member and appeared to be split down partisan lines in favor of a historic expansion of executive power, with the conservatives – including the sometimes swing vote of Justice Amy Coney Barrett – seeming to side with the administration.

The US defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, stated repeatedly in 2016 on Fox News that US service members should refuse “unlawful” orders from a potential president Trump – exactly the position he called “ [despicable](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5621756-pete-hegseth-democratic-lawmakers-influence-video/)” when Democratic lawmakers said it last month.

The debate about whether US soldiers should refuse illegal orders is now at the center of a fiery political dispute over the US killings of alleged drug traffickers in boats off the coast of Venezuela and Colombia.

This is how great runs end. Not with a single catastrophic collapse, but with a slow drift towards the finish, looking old, tired and out of ideas. For the Chiefs, that sense of finality arrived on Sunday night, delivered by the Texans in a 20-10 defeat at home that felt more lopsided than the score.

Whether judging by the eye test or the advanced data, this year’s group has been _slightly_ better than the 15-win team who trudged through one-score victories last season, got hot in the playoffs and then were crushed by the Eagles in the Super Bowl. Even as the losses mounted this year, it felt like the Chiefs still had a run in them. If they could figure out their disjointed offense and find any juice on defense, they could sneak into the playoffs.

That killing has been met with intense scrutiny and accusations of war crimes after the Washington Post [reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/11/28/hegseth-kill-them-all-survivors-boat-strike/) defense secretary Pete Hegseth gave an order to [“kill them all”](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/29/pete-hegseth-denies-ordering-deaths-narco-boat). Adm Frank Bradley of the US navy, who oversaw the attack, told lawmakers on Thursday there was [no such order](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/05/us-airstrike-survivors-clung-to-boat-wreckage-for-an-hour-before-second-deadly-attack-video-shows) – and the Pentagon has defended the legality of the attack.

The woman who publicly alleged that she was 17 when a longtime Roman Catholic priest in [Alabama](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/alabama) successfully offered her financial support in exchange for sex and other forms of private companionship – recently prompting him to [resign](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/28/robert-sullivan-alabama-catholic-priest) from the clergy – says “there is no real winner in this situation”.

In her first remarks since Robert “Bob” Sullivan’s self-imposed removal from the priesthood was announced by his church superiors, Heather Jones wrote in a statement that the only thing she gained was “truth finally coming to light after years of gaslighting myself into thinking it wasn’t a big deal”.

Being a member of the Pentagon press corps was once one of the more prestigious assignments in US journalism, a position reserved for heavy hitters from venerable newspapers and news channels, reporters at the peak of their powers.

Not any more. A press conference last week – held at a crucial time for a Pentagon embroiled in scandal – was instead attended by more than a dozen rightwing activists, with the government being held to account by a close ally of Donald Trump, an employee at Turning Point USA and someone from a pillow salesman’s nascent media company.

[Pete Hegseth](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pete-hegseth) is facing the most serious crisis of his tenure as defense secretary, engulfed by allegations of war crimes in the Caribbean and a blistering [inspector general report](https://www.washingtonpost.com/documents/1ba8ad2c-5e41-4c54-ba1d-78e5feb66a2e.pdf) accusing him of mishandling classified military intelligence. Yet despite the long list of trouble and as lawmakers from both parties call for his resignation, Hegseth shows no signs of stepping down and still holds Donald Trump’s support.

The twin crises have engulfed the former Fox News personality in separate but overlapping allegations that lawmakers, policy experts and former officials say reveal a pattern of dangerous recklessness at the helm of the Pentagon. Democratic legislators have reignited calls for his ouster after revelations that survivors clinging to wreckage from a September boat strike were deliberately killed in a “double-tap” attack, while a defense department investigation released on Thursday concluded he violated Pentagon policies by sharing sensitive details via the Signal messaging app hours before airstrikes in Yemen.

The entire US childhood vaccine schedule is now open for scrutiny, experts say, after government vaccine advisers took up discussions of the safety and efficacy of the vaccines and their components and changed its recommendations on one crucial prevention.

Several of the vaccine advisers are longtime anti-vaccine activists, and they were all chosen by Donald Trump’s controversial health secretary Robert F. Kennedy after he fired the previous advisers in an unprecedented move to enact dramatic changes to US vaccination policy. Kennedy has been a frequent critic of vaccines.

A [justice department memo](https://prismreports.org/2025/12/04/prison-rape-elimination-act-trans-intersex-trump-doj/) issued on Tuesday said “effective immediately”, prisons and jails will no longer be held responsible for violations of standards meant to shield LGBTQ+ people from harassment, abuse and rape. It also directed inspectors to stop auditing facilities for compliance with those protections. The justice department is in the process of seeking formal updates to the rules, the memo said.

The [US supreme court](https://www.theguardian.com/law/us-supreme-court) agreed on Friday to decide the legality of Donald Trump’s order to heavily restrict the right to birthright citizenship, the long-held [constitutional principle](https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/about-immigration/birthright-citizenship/) that individuals born on US soil are automatically United States citizens.

The justices will hear the president’s request to uphold his [executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-the-meaning-and-value-of-american-citizenship/) on birthright citizenship, issued just hours after Trump took office for his second term and immediately blocked from taking effect.

A federal judge in Florida ordered the release of grand jury transcripts from the Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell sex-trafficking cases on Friday, citing the recently enacted federal law that overrides traditional secrecy protections.

      <source:markdown>Paper published in 2000 found glyphosate was not harmful, while internal emails later revealed company’s influence

The journal Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology [has formally retracted](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273230099913715) a sweeping scientific paper published in 2000 that became a key defense for Monsanto’s claim that Roundup herbicide and its active ingredient glyphosate don’t cause cancer.

Martin van den Berg, the journal’s editor in chief, said in a [note](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273230099913715) accompanying the retraction that he had taken the step because of “serious ethical concerns regarding the independence and accountability of the authors of this article and the academic integrity of the carcinogenicity studies presented”.

The paper, titled Safety Evaluation and Risk Assessment of the Herbicide Roundup and Its Active Ingredient, Glyphosate, for Humans, concluded that Monsanto’s glyphosate-based weed killers posed no health risks to humans – no cancer risks, no reproductive risks, no adverse effects on development of endocrine systems in people or animals.

**Among the beneficiaries of [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump)’s pardons and commutations, there is a group that legal experts and political scientists see as some of the clearest evidence of how such actions undermine the rule of law: those who were released from prison and again arrested for different alleged crimes**.

During his first term, Trump issued 237 acts of clemency – including to someone who was a predatory lender and drug smuggler and to another who ran a Ponzi scheme.

A grand jury declined to indict Letitia James on Thursday, less than two weeks after a judge ruled that a similar mortgage fraud case brought by federal prosecutors against the New York attorney general was unlawful.

The move by the justice department to present the case again to a grand jury was seen as a signal of its determination to prosecute James, who has been one of Donald Trump’s top political foes ever since she successfully brought a fraud lawsuit against him in New York.

      <source:markdown>Major win for Trump as justices reject lower-court ruling that found maps had been racially gerrymandered

Texas can use a redrawn congressional map that adds as many as five Republican-friendly seats, the supreme court has ruled, giving Donald Trump and the GOP a major win in their push to add Republican congressional seats ahead of next year’s midterm elections.

The supreme court’s decision came after a 2-1 ruling from a three-judge panel striking down Texas’s new map in November. The majority found the state had likely sorted voters based on their race – an unlawful practice called racial gerrymandering – when they adopted the new maps. The majority ordered the state to use the maps it had adopted after the 2020 census for next year’s election.

Dozens of people have been detained across the New Orleans area as the Trump administration’s latest sweeping federal immigration crackdown in a Democratic-led city entered its second day.

Odermatt finished in 1min 29.84sec to surpass Cochran-Siegle by .30sec. Norway’s Adrian Smiseth Sejersted finished third. The finish line was moved up the hill – and just barely visible by fans in the stands – due to a lack of snow to properly place the safety netting.

It also prohibits officials overseeing the city pension system from making decisions in line with the boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) movement, which Mamdani has said he supports.

Thomas was an exuberant child with a button nose and pinchable cheeks – a little kid who loved running fast, playing Minecraft and watching Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, according to a GoFundMe set up by his family.

Donald Trump is seizing on the shooting of two national guard members, allegedly by an Afghan man, to press his immigration crackdown still farther. In the aftermath of the attack, which left guard member Sarah Beckstrom dead and colleague Andrew Wolfe in critical condition, Trump directed US Citizenship and Immigration Services to pause all pending asylum applications.

USCIS followed up that announcement with more seismic shifts to immigration policy. This is how the White House is reshaping the process for requesting asylum, green cards and citizenship.

Among the beneficiaries of [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump)’s pardons and commutations, there is a group that legal experts and political scientists see as some of the clearest evidence of how such actions undermine the rule of law: those who were released from prison and again arrested for different alleged crimes.

During his first term, Trump issued 237 acts of clemency – including to someone who was a predatory lender and drug smuggler and to another who ran a Ponzi scheme. Since taking office again, Trump has issued more than 1,600, most for people involved in the [January 6 attack](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/20/trump-executive-orders-jan-6-pardons) on Congress.

      <source:markdown>Amnesty finds detainees at Florida facility were shackled and left outside in metal cage. Plus, how the dollar-store industry overcharges consumers

Good morning.

Detainees at the notorious Florida immigration jail known as “Alligator Alcatraz” were shackled inside a 2ft-high metal cage and left outside without water for up to a day at a time, a shocking report published on Thursday by Amnesty International alleges.

**Didn’t a judge order the facility to shut down?** A federal judge in August [ordered it to close](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/21/trump-alligator-alcatraz-judge-ruling) after a wave of criticism and a lawsuit by environmental groups. However, by October, the facility was operating again with hundreds of detainees after two Trump-appointed appellate court judges – one whose husband [has close ties](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/02/alligator-alcatraz-ron-desantis-paul-huck) to the Republican governor Ron DeSantis – blocked the closure ruling.

**Has the state of Florida responded to the allegations?** The press secretary to DeSantis told the Guardian the allegations were “fabrications” and part of a “politically motivated attack”.

**Why have they released these photos now?** It’s unclear. Even though the images do not reveal anything new, they keep the pressure on the Trump administration ahead of a 19 December deadline for the justice department to release files, as per the [Epstein Files Transparency Act](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/18/house-vote-epstein-documents), signed 19 November.

      <source:markdown>Pentagon’s Law of War manual clearly prohibits attack, but justification for whole campaign also faces tough questions

Graphic depictions of two survivors being killed by a second US military strike on an alleged Venezuelan drug ferrying boat have provoked outrage where previously there was none – or at least relatively little.

A firestorm of controversy has greeted a recent Washington Post report which suggested that a deadly attack on a vessel carrying 11 people in the Caribbean was followed with a second assault after the initial strike failed to kill everybody onboard.

Two fossil-fuel billionaires with close ties to Donald Trump bought millions of shares in the company they co-founded just days after a meeting with senior White House officials, who then issued a key regulatory permit that helped expand the company’s fortunes in Europe.

Robert Pender, an energy lawyer, and Michael Sabel, a former investment banker, are the [founders and co-chairs of Venture Global](https://ventureglobal.com/about-us/leadership/), a Virginia-based company that develops and operates liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminals.

Good morning.

A family in Colombia has filed a petition with the Washington DC-based Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR), alleging that the Colombian citizen Alejandro Carranza Medina was [subject to an “extrajudicial killing”](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/02/trump-caribbean-drug-boat-attack-complaint) in a US airstrike.

**What is the IACHR?** A monitoring body designed to “promote and protect human rights in the western hemisphere”. The US is a member, and the state department said in March it was a “strong supporter of the IACHR”.

**H** **ow has the Trump administration responded?** A White House spokesperson, Anna Kelly, did not respond directly to questions about the complaint or about Carranza’s death, but wrote in an email that the media were “now running cover for foreign terrorists smuggling deadly narcotics intended to murder Americans”.

**What’s the latest on the front** **lines?** Buoyed up by recent gains, Putin has indicated in recent weeks that the Russian military was prepared to keep fighting if diplomacy faltered, repeatedly emphasising that his forces remained on the offensive on the battlefield.

      <source:markdown>Cleta Mitchell was compelled to testify in North Carolina over a recent law that hiked up requirements

During a federal trial in North Carolina over whether a new voter registration law discriminates against college students, a prominent rightwing election integrity activist previewed Republicans’ long-range plans to end same-day registration.

Judge Thomas Schroeder is deliberating over the future of provisions in Senate bill 747, which increased registration requirements for voters who cast ballots on the same day they register to vote during North Carolina’s early voting period. Schroeder called for briefs at the end of November after a week-long trial in Winston-Salem.

There is a short stretch of prime waterfront real estate in [Miami](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/miami) that has come to be known as [Billionaire’s Beach](https://fortune.com/2025/02/25/miamis-billionaires-beach-offers-an-art-deco-touch-and-110-million-condos/). It contains a mix of famous old art deco hotels such as the Delano and Raleigh, both undergoing extensive upmarket refurbishments, and the construction of exclusive new residential tower blocks with high-end apartments running into the tens of millions.

It is here on the sun-filled shores of South Beach, more than a thousand miles from the chills of a Manhattan winter, where realtors and developers are beginning to see the first shoots of what they call the “Mamdani effect”: the predicted [exodus of wealthy New Yorkers](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/05/mamdani-election-win-rightwing-republicans) in the wake of socialist democrat Zohran Mamdani’s election as mayor.

The Pentagon on Tuesday scapegoated a navy admiral for the extrajudicial double-tap strike that killed survivors of a 2 September attack on an alleged drug boat and vowed to continue operations, even as lawmakers investigate whether the attack constituted a war crime.

Wilson added that Pete Hegseth, the Pentagon secretary, “stands behind Admiral Bradley, 100%”.

Billionaires Michael and Susan [Dell](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/dell) pledged $6.25bn on Tuesday to provide 25 million American children under 10 an incentive to claim the new investment accounts for children created as part of [Donald Trump’s](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump) tax and spending legislation.

      <source:markdown>- Williams back in ITIA pool for first time since 2022

- Move required before any potential competitive return

- American claims move does not signal comeback


Serena Williams has taken the procedural move required of any player contemplating a competitive comeback, after the 23-time grand slam singles champion re-entered the International Tennis Integrity Agency’s (ITIA) registered testing pool for the first time since 2022.

Williams, 44, has not played an official match since [her run to the third round of the US Open](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/sep/02/serena-williams-ajla-tomljanovi-us-open-tennis-third-round-retirement) more than three years ago. Although she described her departure at the time as “evolving away” from the sport rather than a hard retirement, she filed the paperwork with the ITIA that September that exempted her from the sport’s stringent whereabouts requirements. To return to competition, however, players must make themselves available for out-of-competition testing for six months before they are allowed to enter an event.

      <source:markdown>The wholesale giant claims the White House misused emergency authority and warns importers could lose refunds even if duties are ruled unlawful

Costco is suing the [Trump administration](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration) over its tariffs, arguing that the White House has exceeded its executive authority in instituting tariffs and that it should be entitled to a refund if the tariffs are found unconstitutional.

In a lawsuit filed to the court of international trade last Friday, the retail giant argued the Trump administration had misused the federal law, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), it cited to impose the tariffs.

A post on social media by US defense secretary [Pete Hegseth](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pete-hegseth), depicting a beloved children’s character aiming a rocket launcher at a cluster of boats, has elicited condemnation from the book’s Canadian publisher.

The image shows a smiling anthropomorphic turtle in military helmet and vest, with a US flag on his arm and a drug-laden boat exploding in the background. “For your Christmas wish list,” Hegseth wrote as the caption.

[Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump) has ordered a “pause” on asylum claims after last week’s shooting of two national guard members in Washington. The suspect in the shooting, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, is a 29-year-old Afghani national who assisted US forces during the two-decade war there and was paroled into the United States in 2021. US citizenship and immigration services awarded him asylum earlier this year.

It is not clear how long the president’s asylum pause will last. [Trump told reporters Sunday](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/11/30/donald-trump-pause-asylum-applications/87544306007/) that the directive “has no time limit, but it could be a long time”.

This striking allusion to Jeffrey Epstein, the well-connected financier who died in jail awaiting trial on sex-trafficking, came during day one of a potentially weeklong proceeding to weigh the legality of evidence gathered during Mangione’s arrest at a McDonald’s restaurant after the killing of a prominent healthcare executive.

      <source:markdown>Morgan Geyser, who stabbed a classmate as a 12-year-old, fled after a decade being raised by state institutions

The haunting apparition of “Slender Man” reappeared last week when Morgan Geyser, a central character in an 11-year-old attempted murder case, briefly absconded from a Wisconsin care home to which she had been transferred after being released from a psychiatric institution over the summer.

Fresh off [a wave of successes](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/05/democrat-election-wins-across-america-caution-around-hope-mamdani-spanberger) in November’s off-year elections, Democrats are angling for an audacious victory in a Republican-heavy Tennessee congressional district where an upset win could amount to a major blow against Donald Trump’s legislative agenda.

Voters on Tuesday will cast ballots in a special election to replace Mark Green, a Republican representing a middle Tennessee district who resigned from Congress in July.

But according to the HR firm ADP average salaries have risen between 4.5% and 6.7% depending on whether workers stayed or switched jobs. The stock markets, though increasingly volatile, are up over 13% since the beginning of the year. And in [some parts of the country](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/rankings/opportunity/economic-opportunity/household-income), notably New York, Boston, DC and San Francisco, the average household income is over $125,000 - almost $41,000 higher than the national average. People in this demographic may be a little more cautious but they’ll spend.

The federal watchdog system at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that oversees complaints about civil rights violations, including in immigration detention, has been gutted so thoroughly that it could be laying the groundwork for the Trump administration to “abuse people with impunity”, experts warn.

Former federal oversight officials have sounded the alarm at the rapid dismantling of guardrails against human rights failures – at the same time as the government [pushes](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/21/deportations-us-government-shutdown-ice-data) aggressive [immigration](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usimmigration) enforcement operations.

Border Patrol agents in Arizona forcibly removed a detained man from a cell, handcuffed him and then injected him with ketamine to sedate him in 2023, according to a [CRCL document](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26301388-cbp-ketamine-memo/) confirming the watchdog’s investigation into the allegation. A Guardian reporter had saved that document just weeks before it was scrubbed from the DHS’s website.

Guards at a privately owned Louisiana detention center systematically mistreated detained immigrants, according to a CRCL [document](https://rfkhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/assets/Pepper-spray-Incident-CRCL-Complaint-Winn_3.27.24.pdf).This included an investigation into a [2024 incident](https://theappeal.org/biden-admin-extended-contract-abusive-ice-detention-center/) during which correctional staff pepper sprayed around 200 detained immigrants who were staging a hunger strike in protest of detention conditions.

In a Florida jail, a 33-year-old immigrant woman with mental health problems was forcibly stripped naked, strapped to a restraint chair and mocked by male guards, according to a CRCL [complaint](https://www.aclufl.org/app/uploads/2024/11/anas_crcl_final_version.pdf) submitted by the ACLU of Florida and RFK Human Rights.

Donald Trump hasn’t stopped joking about running again for the White House in 2028, even as he acknowledges it is “pretty clear” he is constitutionally ineligible for a third term.

Retiring Georgia congresswoman **Marjorie Taylor Greene**

Homeland security secretary **Kristi Noem**

Health and human services secretary **Robert F Kennedy Jr**

Arkansas governor **Sarah Huckabee Sanders**

Virginia governor **Glenn Youngkin**

Georgia governor **Brian Kemp**

South Carolina senator **Tim Scott**

Former UN ambassador **Nikki Haley**

Utah governor **Spencer Cox**

From the moment the Fugees shot to fame in the mid-90s, Prakazrel “Pras” Michél was discounted as an incidental member of the hip-hop superstars. He was the unremarkable New Jersey rhyme spitter by way of Brooklyn who was lucky enough to be a high school classmate of the mesmerizing Lauryn Hill and a cousin to mercurial Wyclef Jean. On the group’s breakout album The Score, Michel’s eight-bar features were minor contributions, relative to Hill’s adroitness as an emcee and balladeer and Jean’s compositional polymathy.

“From Hawaii to Hawthorne, I run marathons, like / Buju Banton, I’m a true champion, like / Farrakhan reads his daily Qur’an / It’s a phenomenon, lyrics fast like Ramadan,” Michél raps on the band’s breakout single Fu-Gee-La, in one of his more pedestrian efforts.

      <source:markdown>In addition to rising prices and tariffs, readers cite growing unemployment as a reason not to exchange gifts this year

Americans are feeling rattled about the state of the economy. Donald Trump has [batted away](https://x.com/Acyn/status/1986601008714424812) question after question from reporters on concerns over higher prices, just a year after he won an election promising to bring down costs.

While the White House has tried to [reduce concern](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/nov/23/affordability-crisis-inflation-costs), floating tariff-funded $2,000 stimulus checks and removing import levies on certain agricultural imports, many consumers remain anxious.

US regulators say they are taking allegations that top banks may have facilitated Jeffrey Epstein’s criminal activity “very seriously”, as they faced calls to investigate executives including the former Barclays boss Jes Staley.

In correspondence seen by the Guardian, bosses from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) said they [had reviewed a letter from the Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/28/elizabeth-warren-urges-us-regulators-to-investigate-jes-staley-ties-to-epstein), which raised concerns over bankers’ alleged support for the convicted child sex offender Epstein.

- Shiffrin cries as fiancé finishes emotional comeback run


Swiss ski star Marco Odermatt started the World Cup super-G season with a Thanksgiving win at Copper Mountain on Thursday, while Aleksander Aamodt Kilde reduced fiancée Mikaela Shiffrin to tears by making his comeback after nearly two years out.

Small changes to the tone of posts fed to users of X can increase feelings of political polarisation as much in a week as would have historically taken at least three years, research has found.

      <source:markdown>On Wednesday, Rahmanullah Lakanwal shot troop members Sarah Beckstrom and Andrew Wolfe

Two national guard members shot on Wednesday in [Washington DC](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/washington-dc) are in critical condition. Here’s what we know so far:

At 2.15pm on Wednesday, a man is alleged to have launched what Jeanine Pirro, the US attorney for the District of Columbia, has called an “ambush-style” gun attack two blocks north-west of the White House on two members of the West Virginia national guard.

The guard members – named as Sarah Beckstrom, 20, and Andrew Wolfe, 24, both newly sworn-in – are currently [hospitalized in critical condition](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/26/national-guard-soldiers-shot-washington-dc).

The suspect, [Rahmanullah Lakanwal](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/27/washington-dc-national-guard-shooting-suspect), 29, was shot at the scene by a third guard member and is being treated in hospital after being arrested. His wounds are not believed to be life-threatening.

Lakanwal faces charges of assault with intent to kill while armed and possession of a firearm during a crime of violence, though if the [national guard members](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/26/white-house-washington-national-guard) die, the charges could be upgraded to first-degree murder.

His motives remain unclear: Pirro has said that “it’s too soon to say” and Jeffery Carroll, an executive assistant DC police chief, said that investigators had no information on a motive and the suspect “came around the corner” and immediately started firing at the troops.

He had driven across the US from the home he shares with his wife and five children in Bellingham, Washington state, allegedly to conduct the attack.

He is believed to have acted alone.

Lakanwal worked with the [CIA in Afghanistan](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/27/washington-dc-national-guard-shooting-suspect), and came to the US in 2021 as part of a program to resettle Afghans who had aided US operations there. The CIA director, John Ratcliffe, said Lakanwal was “a member of a partner force in Kandahar”.

The [Trump administration](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration) has responded to the shooting by ordering 500 more national guard members to Washington, and calling for the reinvestigation of all Afghan refugees who entered under the Biden administration.

US citizenship and immigration services also [said](https://x.com/USCIS/status/1993882694640415163) it has stopped processing all immigration requests for Afghan nationals “pending further review of security and vetting protocols”.

The United States is a country of immigrants but the NFL remains dominated by players born in the USA. Only 5% of players are born abroad and the majority of them make the step into the sport by going to college in the US. True outsiders are unusual and foreign coaches are especially rare, which makes James Cook’s story remarkable.

For a fanbase that’s grown accustomed to looking up at the division rival Green Bay Packers and looking ahead to the next season’s prospects, it’s reason to smell the roses and indulge in some light strutting. But even as fans find themselves looking forward to the Bears’ first playoff berth in five years, something that once seemed unthinkable with a second-year quarterback and a rookie head coaching helming a squad that managed only five wins last year, no fan is thinking the 2025 Bears have a Super Bowl run in them – not without a rap song to lay the marker down.

An area normally the preserve of professional office workers, coffee shops and lunch venues instead bore the hallmarks of a major crime scene as news spread that two national guard troops had been shot. Authorities [later said the shooting suspect had been identified](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/26/washington-national-guard-shooting-suspect) as an Afghan man.

A federal three-judge panel on Wednesday allowed North Carolina to use a redrawn congressional map aimed at flipping a seat to Republicans as part of Donald Trump’s multi-state redistricting campaign ahead of the 2026 elections.

The new map takes aim at North Carolina’s only swing seat, currently held by Democrat Don Davis, an African American who represents more than 20 counties in the state’s north-east. The first district has been represented by Black members of Congress continuously for more than 30 years.

The action follows moves by the administration last week to [weaken federal rules protecting millions of acres of wetlands and streams](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/17112025/trump-administration-weakens-waterways-wetlands-federal-protections/) and [roll back protections for imperiled species](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/20/trump-endangered-species-act) and the places they live.

As the week wore on, and progressives’ fingernails disappeared, Wilson’s share of the vote crept up, slowly but steadily.

But equally interesting is the leaked material itself and where it may have come from.

The [story covers two intercepted phone calls](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/25/trump-envoy-on-russia-ukraine-peace-deal): one between Witkoff and top Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov, and another between Ushakov and Kirill Dmitriev, [who has been deeply involved in negotiations](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/21/who-is-kirill-dmitriev-draft-plan-ukraine-war-russia) with the Trump White House.

      <source:markdown>Witkoff also offered tactical guidance on how Putin should raise subject with Trump, audio recording suggests. Plus, the female pilots on Ukraine’s frontline

Good morning.

Donald Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, told a senior Kremlin official last month that achieving peace in Ukraine [would require Russia gaining control of Donetsk](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/25/trump-envoy-on-russia-ukraine-peace-deal) and potentially a separate territorial exchange, according to a recording of their conversation.

**What did Witkoff say?** “Now, me to you, I know what it’s going to take to get a peace deal done: Donetsk and maybe a land swap somewhere,” Witkoff told Ushakov during the five-minute conversation, according to a transcript of the recording obtained by Bloomberg. “But I’m saying instead of talking like that, let’s talk more hopefully because I think we’re going to get to a deal here.”

**This is a developing story.** Follow the liveblog [here](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/nov/26/russia-ukraine-war-peace-plan-europe-latest-news-updates).

**What has changed?** It marks a sharp departure from Donald Trump’s narrative to the public every time he has discussed the 21 strikes that have killed more than 80 people, which he has portrayed as an effort to stop overdose deaths.

**What have the White House said?** A White House official responded that Trump had not been making a legal argument. Still, the president’s remarks remain the only public reason for why the US is firing missiles – when the legal justification is in fact very different.

The legal analysis rests on a premise – for which there is no immediate public evidence – that the cartels are waging armed violence against the security forces of allies like Mexico, and that the violence is financed by cocaine shipments.

He told jokes in the worst possible taste and watched them arc through the Rose Garden sky before landing with a thud.

Good morning.

A federal judge [threw out the criminal cases against James Comey and Letitia James](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/24/james-comey-letitia-james-charges-case-dismissed) yesterday, concluding that the prosecutor handling the cases was unlawfully appointed.

**What did the judge say?** “I conclude that the attorney general’s attempt to install Ms Halligan as interim US attorney for the eastern district of Virginia was invalid and that Ms Halligan has been unlawfully serving in that role since 22 September 2025,” wrote Currie, who was appointed to the bench by Bill Clinton.

**When did the talks begin?** Reports emerged that a fresh round of US-brokered peace talks had begun last night in the capital of the United Arab Emirates, with Dan Driscoll, the US army secretary, flying in to meet a Russian delegation and a Ukrainian team led by Kyrylo Budanov.

Donald Trump’s administration has steadily increased pressure on Venezuela’s leader, Nicolás Maduro, accusing him of running the “Cartel of the Suns” drug-trafficking organization, and placing a $50m bounty on his head.

Trump invoked the phrase “piggy” – a term he has used before – to describe a female reporter on Friday, and has aggressively responded to at least one other female reporter over the past week, including threatening to revoke ABC’s license.

As misjudgments go, McLaren’s error in calculations that led [to the disqualification of Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/nov/23/max-verstappen-wins-f1-las-vegas-gp-lando-norris-second) from the Las Vegas Grand Prix on Sunday could barely have been more cataclysmic nor more poorly timed. Quite how they got it wrong just when they wanted to close out the drivers’ championship with as little fuss as possible will take no little explanation.

Norris and Piastri, second and fourth respectively to Max Verstappen’s win in Nevada, had been solid enough results until the FIA discovered the skid blocks on their cars had been worn beyond the 9mm limit. In one fell swoop, Verstappen was right back in the fight, alongside Piastri, 24 points back from Norris.

Good morning.

Senator Mark Kelly yesterday urged congressional Republicans to publicly reject Trump’s threats against him and five other Democratic lawmakers who have said that military personnel are not obliged to follow illegal commands.

**What did Kelly say?** “His words carry tremendous weight, more so than anybody else in the country, and he should be aware of that, and because of what he says, there is now increased threats against us,” Kelly said of Trump’s accusations.

**What does the original plan say?** The original [28-point US document](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/20/us-russia-reportedly-draft-plan-end-ukraine-war-zelenskyy) leaked last week demanded that Ukraine should hand over territory to Russia, limit the size of its army and agree not to pursue the Kremlin for alleged war crimes.

      <source:markdown>Exodus of lawyers under Trump weakens department’s capacity in civil rights, national security and other areas

Donald Trump’s weaponization of the US department of justice to focus on retribution against political foes, on fulfilling Maga goals and on granting pardons for allies has seen thousands of lawyers depart or be fired and weakened investigations in civil rights, national security and other areas, say ex-prosecutors and legal experts.

Data compiled by the nonpartisan Justice Connection showed that overall DoJ employment has dropped by about 5,500 lawyers and non-lawyers who have left since Trump took office. That included people who were fired, quit or took a deferred resignation program, underscoring a sharp drop in DoJ resources.

      <source:markdown>Physicians say FDA panel conflated two issues and made baseless claims about unproven health benefits

Estrogen-related medications for menopause will no longer carry broad black-box warnings, Marty Makary, commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), announced last week, bypassing the regulatory agency’s typical process and, according to experts, overstating the science behind the medications – with troubling implications for future drug decisions.

The decision to remove an ominous warning from 2003 about the risks of cardiovascular disease, breast cancer and dementia makes sense for local vaginal estrogen products, but systemic estrogen is more complicated, menopause experts said – and more than these nuances, they worried about the scientific process, or lack thereof, in making the decision.

      <source:markdown>Dr. Carlos Chaccour, physician scientist at the University of Navarra, noticed something fishy about a letter to the editor the New England Journal of Medicine received shortly after it published a paper of his on malaria treatment in July.

The letter was riddled with strange errors such as critiques supposedly based on other research Chaccour himself had written. So he and his co-author Matthew Rudd decided to dig deeper.

They analyzed patterns of letters to the editor over the last decade and found a remarkable increase in what they call &#34;prolific debutantes&#34; — new authors who suddenly had dozens, even hundreds of letters published, starting right around the time OpenAI’s ChatGPT came out.

Why would academics want to do this? Marketplace’s Meghan McCarty Carino spoke with Chaccour to find out.</source:markdown>

      <source:markdown>Statement by Trump administration confirms longstanding suspicions that Musk-led agency is on its way out

The “department of government efficiency” (Doge) has apparently been dissolved with eight months still remaining on its contract, ending a drawn-out campaign of invading federal agencies and firing thousands of federal workers.

“That doesn’t exist,” office of personnel management (OPM) director Scott Kupor told Reuters earlier this month when asked about Doge’s status, adding that it was no longer a “centralized entity”.

      <source:markdown>In a city where football is more than a sport, the gun death of John Beam has provoked an outpouring of emotion

Football in Oakland, California, is more than a sport. It’s a community. In many schools, coaches are like parental figures who get young people through vulnerable times, into universities and sometimes even drafted to the National Football League.

So when gun violence came for longtime Oakland football coach John Beam, whose mentorship had changed the lives of generations of students, the devastation reverberated around the city.

      <source:markdown>Guilty plea by far-right activist lays bare plans for bombings, school shootings and Santas handing out poisoned candies

Michail Chkhikvishvili, a self-described cult leader who called himself “Commander Butcher”, did not look like a Hollywood vision of a contemporary terrorist, despite the bizarre, almost made-for-TV extremist actions he planned, such as having people dressed as Santa Claus hand out poison candies on the streets of New York.

Chkhikvishvili appeared in a Brooklyn court last week as one might find an office IT tech: close-cropped hair and black-rimmed glasses, attentive, clear-spoken and cooperative as he was questioned about his understanding of a plea that could see him imprisoned for up to 18 years at his March sentencing.

      <source:markdown>Danielle Bensky, who was abused by Jeffrey Epstein, says president was ‘incredibly disrespectful’ in recent comments

A survivor of [Jeffrey Epstein](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein)’s abuse has condemned [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump) for dismissing the victims’ fight for transparency as a “hoax”.

Shortly after [signing a bill to release the Epstein files](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/19/trump-sign-bill-epstein-files), the US president posted a lengthy social media rant accusing [Democrats](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats) of weaponising the scandal against him.

As a child growing up on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota in the 1970s and 80s, Sean Sherman, an Oglala Lakota member and a James Beard award-winning chef, recalls pounding dried bison and mixing it with chokeberry to create a snack called wasná.

Sherman’s earliest memories of food were full of history, culture and spiritualism.

His idealistic experiences of harvesting and hunting for food on the reservation were juxtaposed with the legacy of colonialism. Most of the time, Sherman and his family ate government-issued food such as canned beef, or blocks of cow cheese, which diverged from their traditional diet. It’s a tale that Sherman, co-founder of the Minneapolis-based Indigenous restaurant [Owamni](https://owamni.com/), shares along with other stories in a new cookbook that highlights Indigenous cuisines throughout North America.

One morning in October, Donna DesRuisseaux headed to a local bridge near her home in Goffstown, New Hampshire, armed with a sign that said: “Honk for democracy.” The 62-year-old business manager was taking part in a new tradition of protesting on various bridges and overpasses throughout the state.

      <source:markdown>Despite the US’s economic success, income inequality remains breathtaking. But this is no glitch – it’s the system

The Chinese did rather well in the age of globalization. In 1990, 943 million people there lived on less than $3 a day measured in 2021 dollars – 83% of the population, according to the World Bank. By 2019, the [number was brought down to zero](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.DDAY?locations=CN). Unfortunately, the United States was [not as successful](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.DDAY?locations=US). More than 4 million Americans – 1.25% of the population – must make ends meet with less than $3 a day, more than three times as many as 35 years ago.

The data is not super consistent with the narrative of the US’s inexorable success. Sure, American productivity has zoomed ahead of that of its European peers. Only a handful of countries manage to produce more stuff per hour of work. And artificial intelligence now promises to put the United States that much further ahead.
