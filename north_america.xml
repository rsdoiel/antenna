Meta reported mixed financial results for the third quarter of 2025. The company brought in record quarterly revenue but reported a major tax bill that dampened earnings per share, the company announced on Wednesday. The financial results come as Meta ends a multibillion-dollar hiring spree focused on artificial intelligence talent.

The tech giant earned $51.24bn in quarterly revenue, beating Wall Street’s expectations and the company’s own projections for third-quarter sales.

      <source:markdown>President’s effort to win $230m in damages from Mar-a-Lago and Russia investigations criticized as ‘frivolous’

[Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump)’s effort to get his justice department to pay him hundreds of millions of dollars is based on specious legal claims that would likely be rejected if he were any other American, according to a legal expert and a former Department of Justice official who handled damages claims against the government.

Trump has asked the justice department to pay him [$230m in damages](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/21/us/politics/trump-justice-department-compensation.html), the New York Times reported last week. The amount is the total of two separate claims in which Trump argues he is entitled to compensation because of investigations into the links between Russia and his 2016 campaign as well as the 2022 search for classified documents at Mar-a-Lago and subsequent criminal prosecution.

In November 2015, in the midst of what was then considered a long-shot campaign for the presidency, Donald Trump released a book called Crippled America.

The book, the 18th in [the Trump canon](https://www.mostrecommendedbooks.com/series/donald-j-trump-books-in-order), is typically self-aggrandising, with Trump describing his own brand as “one of the world’s great icons of quality and excellence”.

The British newspaper the Times has apologized and deleted an article after discovering its reporter had been duped by someone pretending to be Bill de Blasio, the former mayor of New York City.

The newspaper removed the article from its website after the real De Blasio released a statement calling the quotes attributed to him “entirely false and fabricated” and lambasted the Times for its “absolute violation of journalistic ethics”.

In a letter sent to the public university’s administrators on Wednesday, and shared exclusively with the Guardian, the university’s Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) chapter argued that the video amounted to “political expression on a matter of public concern, and thus the very speech the first amendment is meant to protect”.

      <source:markdown>Billionaire’s statement comes a day after UN said humanity missed 1.5C climate target and warned of devastation

Bill Gates has called for a “strategic pivot” in the effort against the climate crisis, writing that the world should shift away from trying to limit rising temperatures to instead focusing on efforts to prevent disease and poverty.

Writing on his [Gates Notes website](https://www.gatesnotes.com/home/home-page-topic/reader/three-tough-truths-about-climate), the billionaire Microsoft co-founder criticized what he described as a “doomsday view of climate change” which is focusing “too much on near-term emissions goals”.

        <![CDATA[<p>Six NFL teams played in London this month. The players were so jet-lagged they barely knew what day it was but they loved the experience</p><p>It’s 6.30pm on Sunday evening and LA Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford is speaking to reporters in an unpleasant-smelling makeshift press room in Wembley Stadium when he is interrupted by a booming voice from behind a curtain. It’s teammate Davante Adams shouting “Whose house?” in delight after his three touchdowns in the romp over Jacksonville Jaguars.</p><p>Adams knows what it means to score a hat-trick at Wembley but he is less certain about what day it is. “I feel like I’m connected to the country and the people now,” he says. With the game kicking off at 6.30am back home on the west coast, the Rams had taken the lead before most of their fans had settled on the sofa with their morning coffee. Adams and his teammates will soon be heading 5,400 miles home – just 36 hours after arriving.

      <source:markdown>Six NFL teams played in London this month. The players were so jet-lagged they barely knew what day it was but they loved the experience

It’s 6.30pm on Sunday evening and LA Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford is speaking to reporters in an unpleasant-smelling makeshift press room in Wembley Stadium when he is interrupted by a booming voice from behind a curtain.

But over the past year, she says her business, which includes an international money transfer kiosk, has taken a major hit.

      <source:markdown>- Dodgers win in 18, tying longest World Series game

- LA lead 2-1 in series ahead of Tuesday’s Game 4

Two innings later, Freeman hit the ball even harder, but not quite high enough as Varsho chased it down before it could reach the centerfield wall. The two teams were now playing the second-longest World Series game of all-time.

[Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump) said on Monday morning that he would rule out running for the vice-presidency in the 2028 US election, an unorthodox approach that some of his supporters have floated to allow the Republican US president to serve a third term in the White House.

Good morning.

The US and China have [agreed a framework for a trade deal](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/27/us-china-framework-trade-deal-xi-trump-meeting) only days before Donald Trump and the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, are due to meet.

**What about other trade deals that are still up in the air?** There were hopes of a truce between the US and Brazil after what President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva described as a positive meeting with Trump in Malaysia. He said their respective teams would start discussing tariffs and other matters “immediately”.

**And Canada?** Trump said Saturday that he would [raise US tariffs by 10%](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/25/trump-tariffs-canada-ronald-reagan) in retaliation for an [advertisement](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/24/trump-canada-trade-negotations-ontario-tariffs) sponsored by the Ontario government that accurately quoted Ronald Reagan at length saying tariffs don’t work.

**How many people have been killed in the airstrikes?** US forces in recent weeks have carried out at least eight strikes against boats in the Caribbean off Venezuela’s coast, killing about 40 people that the Trump administration has insisted were involved in smuggling drugs.

      <source:markdown>Increase was largely driven by a 4.1% increase in gasoline prices despite Trump’s campaign pledge to ‘end inflation’

Prices continued to rise in September, increasing at an annual rate of 3%, according to the latest government [inflation](https://www.theguardian.com/business/inflation) report.

The September 2025 consumer price index (CPI) was published approximately two weeks later than usual due to the federal government shutdown, [which halted](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/03/trump-shutdown-us-jobs-data) all Bureau of Labor Statistics operations.

The NBA scoreboard has turned into a stock ticker. Crowd chants, but half of them are watching their parlays instead of the play. Somewhere a coach calls timeout; somewhere else a bookmaker grins. This was always coming. The NBA invited gambling to the game when it signed lucrative sponsorship deals and paved the way for odds and offers to be splashed over our TV screens during games. So when the FBI finally showed up on Thursday, they were simply collecting the rent.

Portland head coach Chauncey Billups, whose playing career ended with his induction in the hall of fame, and Miami guard Terry Rozier [were arrested Thursday](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/23/heats-rozier-and-blazers-coach-billups-reportedly-arrested-over-separate-gambling-claims) in connection with an FBI investigation into allegations of illegal gambling and rigged poker games. Former player and assistant coach Damon Jones, [who allegedly provided](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/46700252/source-bettors-got-privileged-injury-info-lebron-james) “inside information” about NBA games to bettors, was also taken into custody.
