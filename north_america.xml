      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Earlier this month, a company called Tricolor abruptly filed for bankruptcy. The Texas-based firm offered auto loans to buyers with poor (or no) credit ratings. That so-called “subprime” auto market has grown to $80 billion. But Tricolor's collapse could make it harder for some buyers to get car loans. We hear more. Plus, President Donald Trump unveils a new batch of tariffs, and D.C. braces for more economic pain ahead of a looming shutdown.</p>]]>

A major cut like that could lower bond yields and reduce borrowing costs, spurring spending. But longer-term, inflation would likely balloon. After that: Auto dealers face new obstacles as EV tax credits end, a traveling nurse navigates frequent moves, and U.S. economic growth is “more resilient than expected," according to an OECD report.</p><br/><p><em>Every story has an economic angle.

        <![CDATA[<p>President Trump is not a fan of the United Nations—he made that clear in his speech to the United Nations General Assembly today. Under Trump, the United States has pulled back from several efforts, including U.N. organizations, that have contributed to the country’s so-called soft power goals. On the show today, Joshua Eisenman, professor of politics in the Keough School of Global Affairs at the University of Notre Dame, joins Kimberly to discuss the changing role of the U.S. in global politics and how China is seizing this moment to gain more influence.</p><br/><p>Here’s everything we talked about today:</p><br/><ul><li><a href="https://apnews.com/article/united-nations-unga-trump-global-feb243ecb979d53317dfb1cad9968038">"Trump tells UN in speech that it is 'not even coming close to living up' to its potential"</a> from AP News</li><li><a href="https://www.cfr.org/article/geopolitics-trump-tariffs-how-us-trade-policy-has-shaken-allies">"Geopolitics of Trump Tariffs: How U.S. Trade Policy Has Shaken Allies"</a> from Council on Foreign Relations</li><li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/19/world/asia/china-united-nations-trump.html">"How China Stands to Gain as the U.S. Steps Away From the U.N."</a> from The New York Times</li><li><p><a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/08/25/global-south-china-engagement/">"The Global South Won't Give Up on China"</a> from Foreign Relations</p><br/><p>It's Marketplace's Fall Fundraiser!

        <![CDATA[<p>Economist Stephen Miran is now temporarily on the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors. Miran wants steeper rate cuts, arguing that stricter controls at the borders and deportations will free up housing, make it less expensive, and keep a lid on inflation at a time of tariffs. We'll discuss what the data says about his claims. Also: growing threats to undersea data cables and an update on the cyberattack affecting Jaguar and Land Rover production.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>The newest member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors — close ally of President Donald Trump, Stephen Miran — made his case for more (and larger) interest rate cuts in a speech yesterday at the Economic Club of New York. He argued that the president's policies will push prices down, so the Fed doesn’t have to worry that lowering interest rates will spark inflation. Plus, entrepreneurship could suffer following the Trump administration's new $100,000 fee for H-1B visas.</p>]]>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>There’s a race going on among tech firms — big and small — to join in the construction of what President Trump has dubbed the Golden Dome, a missile defense system similar to Israel’s Iron Dome. Tens of billions of dollars in military contracts are at stake. In fact, the total cost might be in the trillions and the project could stretch a decade. </p><br/><p>The technology and scale needed to make this all happen is, so far, largely unproven. And a whole host of tech firms are trying to show that they can help with the very complex undertaking.  Marketplace’s Nova Safo spoke with Sheera Frenkel, reporter at the New York Times, about some of the tech that would make this whole system work.</p>]]>

Technology, finance, and other major companies that depend on employees holding H-1B visas had initially thought the fee would be applied to existing visa holders, and those with H-1B workers who were temporarily abroad panicked. The fee only applies to new visa applicants, though, the White House later clarified. Also: an AI industry political action network and dark clouds for Broadway productions.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Wyoming made billions from coal mining over the last 50 years, funding the government, schools, roads, parks. But President Trump’s major spending bill, passed in July, gives mining companies a break on royalty fees — leaving state budgets lean. In this episode, easing coal fees comes at a price. Plus: Non-store retail spending saw double-digit year-over-year growth, small businesses suffer as they wait for tariff clarity, and stock investors basically ignore all the bad economic headlines.</p><br/><p><em>Every story has an economic angle.

        <![CDATA[<p>Public companies report their earnings every three months, giving investors and the public regular snapshots of how business is going. But President Trump wants to see fewer of those reports. In a social media post on Monday, he said companies should report just twice a year instead of quarterly.

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>On Monday, President Trump said public companies should no longer report quarterly earnings. Instead, he suggested corporations report just twice a year. Trump isn't the first to suggest a pared-down reporting schedule, but the idea raises questions about the balance between corporate transparency and long-term growth. Also on the show, the South Korean government has launched an investigation into potential human rights violations during a U.S. immigration raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia, where 300 South Korean workers were detained and deported. So what does this episode tell us about the U.S. immigration system? Stuart Anderson, executive director of the National Foundation of American Policy, joins us to discuss.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>"When you face bad economic numbers, you've got two choices: fix the economy or attack the numbers," says University of Michigan economist Justin Wolfers. Today, we'll discuss what to make of how the Bureau of Labor Statistics collects data on jobs and inflation, as well as the doubts cast on BLS under the second Trump administration.

The central bank is largely supposed to be insulated from politicians. However, this is unlikely to be the final word on the matter. And later, consumers have choices for many services.
