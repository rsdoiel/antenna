      <source:markdown>The state has killed 15 people this year with two more scheduled this month as death penalty in decline across US

Death penalty opponents have decried an unprecedented surge in executions ordered by Florida’s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, after the state maintained a record pace with last week’s killing of a military veteran.

Norman Mearle Grim, who was convicted of the 1998 murder and rape of a neighbor, became the [15th person put to death](https://www.alligator.org/article/2025/10/florida-man-executed-for-1998-murder-and-sexual-battery-of-next-door-neighbor) this year, by lethal injection, at the Florida state prison in Starke on Wednesday.

      <source:markdown>The political differences between the two main candidates could have major implications for next year’s midterms

New Yorkers will find out the identity of their next mayor on Tuesday, in a race that will decide who will run, and defend, the US’s largest city at a time when [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump) has threatened to send military troops there.

Against that backdrop, New York has seen a mayoral election that has pitted two very different Democrats against one another. The race has become an increasingly bitter face-off, laced with alleged racism and Islamophobia, but it is the political differences between the two main candidates that could have major implications for how the Democratic party performs in next year’s midterm elections.

      <source:markdown>Food insecurity for millions of Americans set to increase with Trump officials saying Snap benefits will cease as government shutdown enters second month

Waves of hungry Angelenos gathered outside Community Space food bank’s storefront on a recent afternoon, grabbing dry goods like pastries, bagels, lentils and pasta along with refrigerated salads and frozen bags of brisket.

The crowd ebbs and flows all day, said founder Gaines Newborn, but as news spread last week that the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap) would cease on Saturday, he braced for the need to dramatically increase.

A spectre is haunting the NBA – the spectre of Victor Wembanyama.

All the powers of the old guard have entered into a tenuous alliance to contain this unicorn: rivals Luka Dončić and Anthony Edwards, the Oklahoma City radicals, and the one with the most to lose, Nikola Jokić.

The New York City Marathon, like the city it takes over each fall, is as vast as it is vibrant; as loud as it is chaotic; and more than a little daunting, too.

It has been a giddy, glorious and occasionally bumpy ride, but this time, it seems, Frankie Dettori’s mind is made up. The most storied jockey of the past 40 years will effectively head into retirement after the main card at the Breeders’ Cup at Del Mar on Saturday, when he will have three chances to add a farewell Grade One winner to nearly 300 on his record already. Racing may not see a career quite like it again.

Alongside Lester Piggott and perhaps John McCririck over the past half-century, “Frankie” registers with pretty much everyone, no surname required. People know who he is, even if they have no interest at all in what he does.

A small conservative revolution has swept the humanities at some US colleges and universities.

Often funded by outside donors or earmarks from state governments, the programs tend to bear names featuring words such as “civic”, “freedom” or “classical”.

These centers do credible teaching and research, and are usually not explicitly political. But their goal, to counter what conservatives see as hegemonically leftwing teaching, arguably is.

My beloved friend Pancho is an off-track thoroughbred who has been with me for 24 years. In his youth, in the early 2000s, he soldiered through a vigorous mid-level career on the competitive tracks of Southern California. At nearly 28 now his life is approaching its natural end. Our life together riding trails has been the purest gift. But his slow decline forces me to face the unsettling possibility of euthanasia. It’s a decision that haunts me constantly, like a whispering djinn. Some days are good, some are not. Though I dread the day I may walk into the barn and he lets me know he needs my help to die I am consoled only by the dignity of his life. He’s privileged where many thoroughbreds of his day and thousands since were not. As it was back then, as it is now and will continue to be, for the young racehorse who dies on the track there is no dignity in the end.

As thoughts of Pancho’s creeping decline weighed on me, I took a job at a large equine hospital to fill gaps in my knowledge and learn how best to care for him as health problems arise. But after a while I admitted to myself that the more sincere reason I am there is to observe other horses die. It may sound dark or morbid, but it hardly compares with the deaths I’ve witnessed before: young racehorses with shattered legs or hearts that burst mid-stride, collapsing before an audience in the name of sport.

      <source:markdown>Uncertainty surrounds the signing of this week’s trade deals amid the failure to secure reciprocity from the US to cut tariffs

On Donald Trump’s whirlwind tour of Asia – [which involved stops in Malaysia, Japan and Korea](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/24/trump-asia-tour-key-questions-xi-jinping-china-japan-south-korea-malaysia) – the US president triumphantly collected new trade deals from countries hoping for a reduction in the tariffs he slapped on them earlier this year.

However – China aside – analysts were left asking just how much Asian nations got out of it.

- [US government shutdown: tell us how it could affect your access to food or health insurance](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/30/us-government-shutdown-snap-health-insurance)


In the days leading up to the Trump-Xi meeting, American officials signalled that the US president did not intend to make good on a recent threat to impose an additional 100% import tax on Chinese goods.

Also that China had shown signs it is willing to relax its export controls on rare earths as well as revive buying soybeans from the US.

The relationship with China is very good.

Because of the tremendous destructive power, I HATED to do it, but had no choice! Russia is second, and China is a distant third, but will be even within 5 years.

Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis. That process will begin immediately.

Aidan O’Brien’s gallop towards an extension of his record for Group One wins in a season has slowed a little in recent weeks, but there was still a shield-beating sense of theatre about the scene as his team for the 2025 Breeders’ Cup meeting at Del Mar this weekend made its way to the track for morning exercise on Wednesday.

Unlike 2024, when City Of Troy was being aimed at the Classic, there is no obvious headliner in the O’Brien lineup, but plenty of the horses trotting past in a well-ordered single file have banked at least one Group One already this season and four are expected to set off as favourite.

More than 40 million Americans will stop receiving food stamps on 1 November, as the US government shutdown enters its fifth week.

The Department of Agriculture says the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap) will be suspended until Congress reopens the government. While the Trump administration argues the department does not have the legal authority to use a $5bn contingency fund to continue the aid, Democrats disagree, and two dozen states [have sued](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/28/food-stamps-lawsuit-states-sue-trump-administration) the government to force the program to continue.

In [a letter](https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000019a-3389-d77a-adda-3bab67e90000&#38;nname=playbook&#38;nid=0000014f-1646-d88f-a1cf-5f46b7bd0000&#38;nrid=00000168-5c87-d6fb-a77d-fdb72f6a0000) addressed to the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, and the heads of Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( [ICE](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ice-us-immigration-and-customs-enforcement)) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Pritzker said federal agents were “ignoring their duty to protect the public and uphold the constitution” by conducting raids and arrests in line with the US president’s mass deportation [agenda](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usimmigration). The Democrat said such raids had “endangered the lives of innocent community members and traumatized children”.

      <source:markdown>Group of 11 Democratic senators has raised concerns about use of Wrap full-body restraints on US deportation flights

A “near-total secrecy” surrounding deportation flights and the use of full-body restraints onboard is raising “serious human rights concerns”, a group of 11 Democratic US senators wrote in a letter on Thursday to top immigration officials.

Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland called upon US Immigration and Customs Enforcement to provide a full accounting of its air operations and to stop using the black and yellow restraints known as the Wrap until the agency explains its policies for the device and resolves other questions about its use on immigration detainees.

      <source:markdown>Guardian analysis finds ICE increasingly keeps people in holding rooms with little oversight, as some facilities see a 600% rise in detention length

[US immigration](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usimmigration) officials have been increasingly detaining people in small, secretive holding facilities for days or even weeks at a time in violation of federal policy, a Guardian investigation has found.

These holding facilities – located at ICE offices, in federal buildings and other locations around the country – are typically used to detain people after they have been arrested but before they are transferred or released. In many cases, they consist of small concrete rooms with no beds and are designed to only be used for a few hours.

ICE has used at least 170 ICE holding facilities nationwide, including at 25 ICE field offices.

The Trump administration and its campaign of mass deportation has led to a near across the board increase in the time people are forced to spend in detention in holding rooms. After Donald Trump’s inauguration, the average time that people spend in detention increased at 127 hold rooms across the country.

Despite ICE’s rule change in June, the agency is continuing to violate its own policy by detaining people at these sites for multiple days at a time.

In some cases, such as a New York City holding facility located on the 10th floor of a federal building in downtown Manhattan, time in detention increased by nearly 600% on average after the June rule change.

In one case the Guardian discovered by looking through agency data, ICE documented that a 62-year-old man was held inside that same New York City holding facility for two and a half months.

The Guardian also found an additional 63 people at the site who were held there for longer than one week, between Trump’s inauguration and late July.

A handful of door-knockers ran into an apartment building to escape the rain, joining Omar Fateh, the mayoral hopeful sometimes dubbed the “Mamdani of Minneapolis”.

Meta reported mixed financial results for the third quarter of 2025.

      <source:markdown>President’s effort to win $230m in damages from Mar-a-Lago and Russia investigations criticized as ‘frivolous’

[Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump)’s effort to get his justice department to pay him hundreds of millions of dollars is based on specious legal claims that would likely be rejected if he were any other American, according to a legal expert and a former Department of Justice official who handled damages claims against the government.

Trump has asked the justice department to pay him [$230m in damages](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/21/us/politics/trump-justice-department-compensation.html), the New York Times reported last week. The amount is the total of two separate claims in which Trump argues he is entitled to compensation because of investigations into the links between Russia and his 2016 campaign as well as the 2022 search for classified documents at Mar-a-Lago and subsequent criminal prosecution.

The book, the 18th in [the Trump canon](https://www.mostrecommendedbooks.com/series/donald-j-trump-books-in-order), is typically self-aggrandising, with Trump describing his own brand as “one of the world’s great icons of quality and excellence”.

US district judge Shelly Dick last week ordered US Immigration and Customs Enforcement to keep Chanthila “Shawn” Souvannarath, 44, in the United States while he presented what the judge called his “substantial claim of US citizenship”, court records show. He was born in a refugee camp in Thailand but was granted lawful permanent residence in the US before his first birthday, according to court filings.

Gio Reyna went into the 2022 World Cup as one of United States’ brightest young stars.

      <source:markdown>Report offers no proof of wrongdoing but repeats disputed claims about Biden’s awareness of decisions in office

US House Republicans on Tuesday unveiled their long-promised report on [Joe Biden](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden)’s use of the autopen during his presidency, largely rehashing public information while criticizing his time in office and making sweeping accusations about the workings of his White House.

The [Republicans](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans)’ report does not include any concrete evidence that aides conspired to enact policies without Biden’s knowledge or that he was unaware of laws, pardons or executive orders signed in his name. Nonetheless, Republicans maintained their findings cast doubt on Biden’s actions in office. And they sent a letter to Pam Bondi, the attorney general, urging a full investigation – after Donald Trump had [previously ordered a similar inquiry](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/05/joe-biden-dismisses-donald-trump-inquiry-into-his-cognitive-decline-as-a-distraction).

Mario Guevara has said he may have been “the first” immigrant journalist whom Donald Trump’s administration [deported](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/03/journalist-mario-guevara-ice-deportation) from the US while working – but the Emmy award-winner added: “I don’t think \[I’ll\] be the only one.”

“Just be careful because \[immigration agents are\] very aggressive,” Guevara recently said from El Salvador in a virtual [interview with the US Press Freedom Tracker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Hqf_ld8woI), during which he was asked whether he had any message for other immigrant colleagues in the industry. “They showed they are – they don’t care about journalists.

- Ohtani reaches base postseason-record nine times

- LA lead 2-1 in series ahead of Tuesday’s Game 4


It took Freddie Freeman three chances to get it just right.

When the Los Angeles Dodgers first baseman drove a fastball deep into centerfield in the bottom of the 13th inning, the home fans at Dodger Stadium groaned as the ball nestled into Toronto Blue Jays centerfielder Daulton Varsho’s glove to make Game 3 of the 2025 World Series just the fifth World Series game to ever reach the 14th inning. Two innings later, Freeman hit the ball even harder, but not quite high enough as Varsho chased it down before it could reach the centerfield wall.

Good morning.

The US and China have [agreed a framework for a trade deal](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/27/us-china-framework-trade-deal-xi-trump-meeting) only days before Donald Trump and the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, are due to meet.

**What about other trade deals that are still up in the air?** There were hopes of a truce between the US and Brazil after what President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva described as a positive meeting with Trump in Malaysia. He said their respective teams would start discussing tariffs and other matters “immediately”.

**And Canada?** Trump said Saturday that he would [raise US tariffs by 10%](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/25/trump-tariffs-canada-ronald-reagan) in retaliation for an [advertisement](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/24/trump-canada-trade-negotations-ontario-tariffs) sponsored by the Ontario government that accurately quoted Ronald Reagan at length saying tariffs don’t work.

**How many people have been killed in the airstrikes?** US forces in recent weeks have carried out at least eight strikes against boats in the Caribbean off Venezuela’s coast, killing about 40 people that the Trump administration has insisted were involved in smuggling drugs.

A [statement](https://www.cair.com/press_releases/breaking-cair-calls-on-ice-to-release-sami-hamdi-british-journalist-abducted-over-criticism-of-israels-genocide/) from Cair said it was “a blatant affront to free speech” to detain Hamdi for criticizing Israel’s ongoing military campaign in Gaza while he engaged on a speaking tour in the US. A [Trump administration](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration) official added in a separate statement that Hamdi was facing deportation.

So when the FBI finally showed up on Thursday, they were simply collecting the rent.

Portland head coach Chauncey Billups, whose playing career ended with his induction in the hall of fame, and Miami guard Terry Rozier [were arrested Thursday](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/23/heats-rozier-and-blazers-coach-billups-reportedly-arrested-over-separate-gambling-claims) in connection with an FBI investigation into allegations of illegal gambling and rigged poker games. Former player and assistant coach Damon Jones, [who allegedly provided](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/46700252/source-bettors-got-privileged-injury-info-lebron-james) “inside information” about NBA games to bettors, was also taken into custody.
