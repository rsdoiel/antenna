The mantra has quickly captured the bursting anger and grief of a nation; activists and progressive lawmakers like the representative Ayanna Pressley, and even the conservative commentator [Bill Kristol](https://bsky.app/profile/billkristolbulwark.bsky.social/post/3mbucyb5afk2v) have embraced the demand. Shri Thanedar, a Democratic representative from Michigan, said he planned to introduce the “Abolish ICE act”, a bill that would dismantle the federal agency and its current enforcement authority. For the first time, more US adults now support eliminating ICE than those who oppose it, according to a [new Economist/YouGov poll](https://d3nkl3psvxxpe9.cloudfront.net/documents/econTabReport_qsNv5iE.pdf).

As the US reaches record-breaking rates of illness and hospitals scramble to care for flu patients, officials have stopped fully recommending the [flu](https://www.theguardian.com/society/flu) shot, casting doubt on the necessity and effectiveness of the [vaccine](https://www.theguardian.com/society/vaccines).

The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, accused a reporter of being a “leftwing activist” during a heated confrontation on Thursday over the killing of Renee Good by an ICE agent last week.

Beginning his question during the White House press briefing, Niall Stanage, a White House columnist for the Hill, referred to the Trump administration’s staunch defense of ICE agents and the assertion by the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, that ICE are “doing everything correctly”. He pointed to statistics showing that last year 32 people [died in ICE custody](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2026/jan/04/ice-2025-deaths-timeline) and 170 US citizens were [detained by ICE](https://www.propublica.org/article/immigration-dhs-american-citizens-arrested-detained-against-will), before noting that Good was “shot in the head and killed by an ICE agent”.

A federal judge on Thursday cleared the way for a New York offshore wind project to resume construction, a victory for the developer who said a Trump administration order to pause it would probably kill the project in a matter of days.

District judge Carl J Nichols, an appointee of Donald Trump, ruled construction on the Empire Wind project could go forward while he considers the merits of the government’s order to suspend the project. He faulted the government for not responding to key points in Empire Wind’s court filings, including the contention that the administration violated proper procedure.

Five months out from the World Cup the politics are impossible to avoid. There are concerns relating to one of the host countries, the US, with armed immigration officials roaming through its cities and visa restrictions [stepped up against foreign visitors](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/14/trump-administration-news-latest-updates-today). One qualifying nation, Iran, is experiencing a public uprising against its leadership, with the regime attacking its citizens in response. Among other qualifiers there are concerns over democratic backsliding in Tunisia, ecological crimes in Ecuador and , in the future host country Saudi Arabia. And that’s just for starters.

It sometimes feels as if this summer’s tournament, the one Gianni Infantino recently described as “the greatest show ever on planet Earth”, will serve as an inescapable reminder of the depressing state of the world in 2026. It could yet be an event that goes down in infamy. But it is hardly the only tournament to have prompted ethical concerns and serves as a reminder that the issue of how global sport should engage with such issues has remained largely unresolved.

Donald Trump has threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act in Minnesota in response to protests in [Minneapolis](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/minneapolis) against federal immigration enforcement operations, as Minnesota’s governor, Tim Walz, overnight urged demonstrators in Minneapolis to be peaceful amid escalating tensions.

The reversal is a blow to the agenda of Robert F Kennedy Jr, the secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services, who has made aggressive and legally contested cuts to health agencies in the first year of the Trump administration and has proposed folding the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (Samhsa) into a new agency he would call the Administration for a Healthy America (AHA).

The justice department is undertaking an unprecedented effort to collect sensitive voter information about tens of millions of Americans, a push that relies on thin legal reasoning and which could be aimed at sowing doubt about the midterm election results this year.

Eight states have voluntarily turned over the information, according to the Brennan Center, and the department has sued 23 states and the District of Columbia for the information.

David Stern used to tell a joke. In his early years as NBA commissioner, he liked to say, his job was essentially to travel back and forth between Boston and Los Angeles to hand out the championship trophy. In the first five NBA Finals after he took the helm in early 1984, the Celtics and Lakers won all five titles, each missing the decisive series just once.

Current commissioner Adam Silver recalled the anecdote last June, ahead of the 2025 NBA Finals, by which time the league was guaranteed a seventh different champion in seven years. “We set out to create a system that allowed for more competition around the league,” Silver [said then](https://apnews.com/article/nba-finals-adam-silver-cd1d47349e0b3964645532f5e04ceb4e) in his annual news conference. “The goal being to have 30 teams all in the position, if well managed, to compete for championships.

      <source:markdown>Move allowing whole and 2% milk to be served in cafeterias overturns Obama-era limits to higher-fat milk options

Whole milk is heading back to school cafeterias across the country after Donald Trump signed a bill on Wednesday overturning Obama-era limits on higher-fat milk options.

Non-dairy drinks such as fortified soy milk may also be on the menu in the coming months after adoption of the Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act, which cleared Congress in the fall.

This week, however, reports emerged of bears appearing under other homes.

      <source:markdown>The Trump administration indefinitely suspended immigrant visa processing from 75 countries – see which nations have been affected

- Full story: [Trump administration halts visa processing from 75 countries](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/14/immigrant-visas-suspended-trump)


The Trump administration has [indefinitely suspended](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/14/immigrant-visas-suspended-trump) immigrant visa processing for people from 75 countries, marking one of its most expansive efforts yet to restrict legal pathways to the United States.

The freeze, which takes effect on 21 January, targets applicants officials deem likely to become a “public charge” – people who they believe may rely on government benefits for basic needs.

A portion of California’s scenic Highway 1, which winds through rugged cliffs along the coast and has long been a highlight for travelers admiring the ocean views, reopened on Wednesday after a years-long closure.

A large section of the road in Big Sur has been cut off due to landslides since 2023, creating challenges for visitors and businesses that rely on tourism.

At face value, if true, we are looking at the single most disruptive announcement in the history of the electric vehicle industry and energy storage as a whole.</p>
        
        
        
        <p>We aren’t just talking about a better motorcycle battery. If the claims of a 5-minute charge, 100,000-cycle life, and ~400 Wh/kg energy density are accurate and scalable, as Donut Lab claims, this is the holy grail of energy storage.</p>
        
        
        
        <p>Battery breakthrough announcements generally don’t catch fire like this, but Donut Lab’s did because it said that the cell was already in production and will be in a production vehicle, Verge’s electric motorcycle, this quarter. It gave credibility to the claim, pushing everyone to report on it.</p>
        
        
        
        <p>Now, we have interviewed Donut Lab’s CEO and investigated the technology. At this point, it looks like either this battery changes the world within the next 3 months, or it will make the CEO look like a fool. In this article, we discuss the impact of the battery, whether real or not, as well as clues about the secret sauce behind its chemistry.</p>

      <source:markdown>![](https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2026/01/Donut-Lab-solid-state-battery.png?w=1133)

Donut Lab lit the EV and energy storage industry on fire last week with its announcement of a 400 Wh/kg solid-state battery cell that can last for 100 years. At face value, if true, we are looking at the single most disruptive announcement in the history of the electric vehicle industry and energy storage as a whole.

We aren’t just talking about a better motorcycle battery. If the claims of a 5-minute charge, 100,000-cycle life, and ~400 Wh/kg energy density are accurate and scalable, as Donut Lab claims, this is the holy grail of energy storage.

Battery breakthrough announcements generally don’t catch fire like this, but Donut Lab’s did because it said that the cell was already in production and will be in a production vehicle, Verge’s electric motorcycle, this quarter. It gave credibility to the claim, pushing everyone to report on it.

Now, we have interviewed Donut Lab’s CEO and investigated the technology. At this point, it looks like either this battery changes the world within the next 3 months, or it will make the CEO look like a fool. In this article, we discuss the impact of the battery, whether real or not, as well as clues about the secret sauce behind its chemistry.

      <source:markdown>The state department cites welfare use as it pauses visa processing for Brazil, Iran, Russia, Somalia and others

The Donald [Trump administration](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration) has indefinitely suspended immigrant visa processing for people from 75 countries, marking one of its most expansive efforts yet to restrict legal pathways to the United States.

The freeze, which takes effect on 21 January, targets applicants officials deem likely to become a “public charge” – who they describe as people who may rely on government benefits for basic needs.

      <source:markdown>Funding to end immediately for up to 2,800 grantees of US agency that serves thousands seeking help and in recovery

The [Trump administration](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration) on Tuesday evening unexpectedly canceled up to $1.9bn in funding for substance use and mental health care, which providers say will immediately affect thousands of patients.

“It feels like Armageddon for everyone who’s on the frontlines of the addiction and mental health space,” said Ryan Hampton, founder of Mobilize Recovery, a national advocacy organization for people in and seeking recovery.

The Environmental Protection Agency says it will stop calculating how much money is saved in healthcare costs avoided and deaths prevented from air pollution rules that curb two deadly pollutants.

The change means the EPA will focus rules for fine particulate matter and ozone only on the cost to industry, part of a broader realignment under [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump) toward a business-friendly approach that has included the rollback of multiple policies meant to safeguard human health and the environment and slow climate change.

Donald Trump called it “seditious behavior by traitors” that was “punishable by death”, an assertion [that caused outrage](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/20/democrats-condemn-trump-military-video-post) and was quickly walked back by the White House, which clarified that the president did not want to execute members of Congress but wanted to see them “held accountable”.

The [US supreme court](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-supreme-court) on Wednesday revived a lawsuit by a Republican congressman in Illinois that challenges a state law allowing mail-in ballots to be counted if they are received after election day.

Bost argued that the Illinois law allowing ballots to be counted up to two weeks after election day if they are postmarked by the deadline unconstitutionally allows an extension of the election period.

      <source:markdown>Study from research firm finds that US greenhouse gas emissions grew faster than economic activity last year

In a reversal from previous years’ pollution reductions, the United States spewed 2.4% more heat-trapping gases from the burning of fossil fuels in 2025 than in the year before, researchers calculated in a study released on Tuesday.

The increase in greenhouse gas emissions is attributable to a combination of a cool winter, the explosive growth of datacenters and cryptocurrency mining, and higher natural gas prices, according to the Rhodium Group, an independent research firm. Environmental policy rollbacks by Donald Trump’s administration were not significant factors in the increase because they were only put in place this year, the study authors said.

[Polling showed](https://progressmichigan.org/2025/12/new-poll-majority-of-michiganders-opposed-to-controversial-data-centers/) just 28% of residents supported new datacenters, and, amid the furor, Dylan Wegela, a Michigan state congressman, [introduced a bill](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/16122025/michigan-lawmakers-introduce-bill-to-repeal-data-center-tax-incentives/) to repeal datacenter tax credits.

      <source:markdown>Celtic’s firing of the Frenchman brings back memories for two US coaches who faced similar struggles

Bob Bradley has never seen Ted Lasso, the TV show set around an American college football coach who finds himself leading a soccer team in England.

“Everybody tells me that I should watch it but I have not,” Bradley said from his home in New Jersey, almost nine years on from his experience. “I lived that a little bit, so I’m not ready to watch it yet.”

      <source:markdown>On Jan. 7, 2025, the Eaton and Palisades Fires began, killing 31 people and destroying around 13,00 homes in the Los Angeles area. A year later, residents are looking to rebuild the lives and homes they once had.

The biggest surprise of [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump)’s first year back in office is how quickly America’s institutions capitulated to “the bully”, said [Michael Steele](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/06/michael-steele-donald-trump-republican-party-interview), a former chair of the Republican National Committee (RNC) turned arch critic.

But with the midterm elections for Congress looming, Steele predicts a resounding Democratic victory amid a hunger among voters to hold the president and his allies accountable for threatening democracy.

A few days before Christmas in Pérez Zeledón, a city in Costa Rica, Greidy Mata stared at two photographs of her late brother. In one image, Randall Gamboa Esquivel flashed a smile prior to his immigration to the United States a year before. In the second, he was lying in a hospital bed in a vegetative state, after being deported back home.

Dinner was served, but Mata seemed indifferent. She kept switching between one photograph and the other until she suddenly recounted that a year ago, in what would become the last family reunion, Gamboa announced he would be leaving for New Jersey.

The family of a Costa Rican man who was deported from the United States in a vegetative state and died shortly after arriving back in his home country is still urgently seeking answers from the authorities about what happened to him while he was in detention.

      <source:markdown>Soren Stevenson says Minneapolis shooting ‘reminiscent in a scary way’ – but he and his neighbors are feeling activated

It was Soren Stevenson’s third day in office as a Minneapolis city council member on Wednesday when Renee Nicole Good was shot and killed by ICE on the edge of his district.

More than a year after a devastating [wildfire](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california-wildfires) tore through Pacific Palisades, all but obliterating one of the west coast’s most iconic neighborhoods, prosecutors are honing their case against the man they say is responsible.

Jonathan Rinderknecht, a 29-year-old occasional Uber driver who used to live in Pacific Palisades, was charged with three felonies by federal prosecutors in October, who claim he was in the neighborhood in the early hours of New Year’s Day. According to [a federal complaint](https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/10/palisades-fire-criminal-complaint.pdf), Rinderknecht allegedly used an open flame – likely a lighter – to start a small blaze that grew to about 8 acres (3.2 hectares) before firefighters rushed to the area and extinguished it.

The fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis has cast a spotlight on ICE’s use-of-force policies, and whether the federal agent who shot her will face an impartial investigation or consequences for his actions.

The agency already receives less oversight for use-of-force incidents than local police departments, and has long resisted efforts to disclose its use-of-force policies.

State and local leaders say they do not believe that the FBI investigation of the shooting death of Renee Nicole Good will be fair and impartial, and are sounding alarms about the impact of federal officials holding onto evidence in a potential prosecution of the ICE agent who killed her.

Minnesota’s lead investigative agency, the bureau of criminal apprehension, initially began investigating the shooting in conjunction with the FBI. But the BCA issued a statement Thursday morning saying that “the US attorney’s office had reversed course: the investigation would now be led solely by the FBI, and the BCA would no longer have access to the case materials, scene evidence or investigative interviews necessary to complete a thorough and independent investigation”.

Here’s one reason Donald Trump seems perennially in a bad mood: he has probably figured out that the America [he fantasizes about](https://www.instagram.com/p/DNl0KP8p7j7/) is out of his reach.

However many immigrants he manages to deport or prevent from entering the country, the white paradise he is promising his Maga base, free of Somalis, Mexican “rapists” and generally people from “shithole countries” – closer in hue to the America where he was born – is not his to offer.

      <source:markdown>State residents worth more than $1bn could face one-off, 5% tax to help fund education, food assistance and healthcare

A battle is brewing in California over a plan to tax billionaires – with tech titans divided over whether they should pay up, or flee the state.

Under a [tax proposal](https://www.cabillionairetax.org/) that could be put to voters this November, any California resident worth more than $1bn would have to pay a one-off, 5% tax on their assets to help cover education, food assistance and healthcare programs in the state.

Tesla has launched a new “Standard” Model Y Long Range in Europe and a non-long range version in Canada, bringing another more affordable version of its best-selling electric SUV to these markets.

The simultaneous launch in the two markets separated by an ocean is due to Model Y vehicles in Canada actually coming from Europe.

Tesla’s trim name-scheming is starting to get a bit complicated.

      <source:markdown>![](https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2026/01/Tesla-Optimus-xAI.png?w=1600)

In a move that completely undermines the “Tesla is an AI company” narrative, Elon Musk’s private startup, xAI, has reportedly told investors that it plans to build the AI to power Tesla’s Optimus robot.

This new development comes from a [Bloomberg report](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-09/musk-s-xai-reports-higher-quarterly-loss-plans-to-power-optimus) detailing xAI’s widening losses and massive cash burn. According to the report, xAI executives explicitly told investors that their goal is to “develop self-sufficient AI to power robots like Tesla’s Optimus.”

This is a massive shift in the narrative and potentially the smoking gun in ongoing shareholder lawsuits regarding Musk’s breach of fiduciary duty.

While it was a turbulent time for traditional media, it opened a window for independent journalists like Marisa Kabas, who is not beholden to covering Trump’s every move, nor saddled with decades of institutional distrust. On 27 January, she received a massive scoop she published in her newsletter, [the Handbasket](https://www.thehandbasket.co/p/omb-memo-freeze-federal-grants-scoop): the US office of management and budget was freezing federal grants.

Witnesses to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent fatally shooting Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis on Wednesday say federal officers impeded the response of emergency medical personnel to the scene, blocking the road with their vehicles.

Emily Heller, a witness who lives near the intersection of 34th Street and Portland Avenue, recorded the scene as it unfolded. She told NBC News that agents blocked people from approaching Good’s vehicle. Her video shows a man who identified himself as a physician asking to check for a pulse and being rebuffed.

Good morning.

US federal agents [shot two people outside a hospital in Portland](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/08/portland-federal-agents-shooting) a day after an ICE officer fatally shot a woman in Minneapolis.

**What** **do local officials** **say?** Portland’s mayor, Keith Wilson said: “We know what the federal government says happened here. There was a time when we could take them at their word. That time is long past.” He called for ICE to pause operations in Portland until the investigation was complete.

**How are Democrats reacting to the shooting of Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis?** Some are threatening to [use the next funding deadline](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/08/democrats-homeland-security-renee-nicole-good) to forcibly restrain ICE.

**The Guardian has debunked** the false [claims about Good’s killing here.](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/09/white-house-minneapolis-ice-killing)

**What did he say about Venezuela?** When [asked how long](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/09/morality-military-might-and-a-sense-of-mischief-key-takeaways-from-trumps-new-york-times-interview) he would be “running Venezuela”, Trump said for “much longer” than a year.

**What about Greenland?** It “may be a choice” between obtaining Greenland or preserving the Nato alliance, he said.

      <source:markdown>X, formerly Twitter, is facing a global backlash because users are directing the platform&#39;s AI chatbot, Grok, to generate non-consensual intimate imagery. Users have been popping up in the replies of women — and sometimes minors — tagging Grok and asking it to generate images of them in bikinis or undressed.

The company and its owner, Elon Musk, have both clarified illegal content will not be tolerated on the platform.

Plus, President Donald Trump signed an executive order late last year aimed at blocking states from enforcing local AI regulations — something a majority have adopted in some form.

And, Meta is a victim of its own success. Its new Ray-Ban smart glasses are selling too fast to keep up with demand.

Marketplace’s Meghan McCarty Carino spoke with Maria Curi, tech policy reporter at Axios, to discuss all these topics on this week’s Marketplace Tech Bytes: Week in Review.</source:markdown>

The killing of a US citizen by a federal immigration agent in [Minneapolis](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/minneapolis) was a five-alarm fire for the [Trump administration](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration). But a torrent of untruths, half-truths, smears and innuendo has been unleashed by the White House, and amplified by its social media and cable television acolytes, in an attempt to douse the flames.

Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic House minority leader, called the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, a “stone cold liar” on Thursday for her efforts to falsely portray the victim, [Renee Nicole Good](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/08/minnesota-ice-shooting-nicole-macklin-good), a 37-year-old mother of three and award-winning poet, as a “domestic terrorist”.

We are barely a week into 2026, and we are already seeing a significant shift in the narrative regarding Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) timeline. After missing yet another high-profile deadline to achieve unsupervised autonomy by the “end of the year” in 2025, Elon Musk has now dropped a new metric that explains a lot — and raises even more questions.

In a new comment today, Musk has stated that Tesla needs to accumulate roughly **10 billion miles** of data to achieve “safe unsupervised self-driving.”

Jessica Plichta was arrested on 3 January after a live interview with a [local news station](https://www.wzzm13.com/article/news/local/protesters-professor-react-to-us-strikes-venezuela-capture-president/69-2a8c465c-17d1-48d3-adb5-541c8f757ad9) about a Grand Rapids, Michigan, protest against the [Trump administration](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration)’s seizure of Nicolás Maduro, Venezuela’s president, in an attack with a reported death toll of [100](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2026/jan/07/europe-greenland-denmark-us-france-trade-weather-latest-news-updates?CMP=share_btn_url&#38;page=with%3Ablock-695f0c0d8f08e0dc61f227d9#block-695f0c0d8f08e0dc61f227d9). The clip went immediately viral, racking up millions of views across social media. While the [headlines](https://www.thedailybeast.com/donald-trump-critic-arrested-on-camera-after-speaking-out-against-maduro-venezuela-capture/) focused on Plichta’s age (22) and that she’s a preschool teacher, Plichta believes the reason for her arrest – seemingly the only one among roughly 200 protesters – went beyond the day’s events.

Plichta, who recently co-founded local group Grand Rapids Opponents of War, which helped organize Saturday’s protest, had visited the Venezuelan capital of Caracas just last month, amid the Trump administration’s blockade. She was a part of a delegation to the International People’s Assembly for Sovereignty and Peace of Our Americas. Activists from dozens of groups planned to attend. But after Trump ordered that Venezuelan airspace be [“closed in its entirety” on 29 November](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/29/trump-venezuelan-airspace-military-00670743), many canceled their trips.

      <source:markdown>UnitedHealth says it will ‘continue to engage’ with lawmakers who began investigating their involvement in nursing home care after Guardian investigation

UnitedHealth has refused to hand over key internal records to lawmakers investigating the company’s [efforts to reduce hospital transfers](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/dec/17/unitedhealth-nursing-homes) for nursing home residents, according to a 7 January letter sent to the company by the US senators Ron Wyden and Elizabeth Warren.

The veteran lawmakers, both members of the powerful Senate finance committee, launched their inquiry last summer following a [Guardian investigation](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/21/unitedhealth-nursing-homes-payments-hospital-transfers) into bonuses that UnitedHealth pays to nursing homes that reduce hospital transfers for their residents. Those are hospitalizations the insurance giant would otherwise have to pay for.

UnitedHealth did not directly respond to questions from the Guardian about the senators’ assertion that the company had failed to turn over internal documents. But it said in a statement that it will “continue to engage” with the senators and that its nursing home care program “improves outcomes” and “reduces unnecessary hospitalizations”.

Donald Trump has sparked outrage by announcing the US will exit the foundational international agreement to address the climate crisis, cementing the US’s utter isolation from the global effort to confront dangerously escalating temperatures.

In [a presidential memorandum](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2026/01/withdrawing-the-united-states-from-international-organizations-conventions-and-treaties-that-are-contrary-to-the-interests-of-the-united-states/) issued on Wednesday, Trump withdrew from the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), along with 65 other organizations, agencies and commissions, calling them “contrary to the interests of the United States”.

By 1934, it was entirely evident what Benito Mussolini was up to. Italy’s dictator had already consolidated power, colonized Libya and annexed the city of Rijeka. He nevertheless got to stage the second-ever World Cup, [managing it with a heavy hand](https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/apr/01/world-cup-moments-1938-italy-benito-mussolini) and even supplanting the Jules Rimet trophy with a far larger one. Hosting and winning that World Cup didn’t sate his expansionist appetites. By the end of the decade, Mussolini would take Ethiopia, annex Albania and back Francisco Franco in the Spanish civil war.

It was equally well established in 1978 in Argentina that General Jorge Rafaél Videla’s military junta, which had taken over two years earlier, was maintaining its grip on power through [systematic detention, torture and murder](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/17/jorge-rafael-videla). Still, protestations from other nations were ignored and the World Cup kicked off.

_Leander Schaerlaeckens’ book on the United States men’s national soccer team, The Long Game, is out on May 12. You can [preorder it here](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/722130/the-long-game-by-leander-schaerlaeckens/). He teaches at Marist University._

A new $100 fee for foreign tourists entering US [national parks](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/national-parks) has triggered chaos and frustrating waits, with staff reporting long entry lines as citizenship checks are made and irate visitors regularly ditching plans to patronize some of America’s most cherished landscapes.

Donald Trump plans to use Venezuela’s vast crude reserves to establish control of most of the western hemisphere’s oil in an attempt to drive the market price down to about $50 (£37) a barrel, according to reports.

The US president has repeatedly raised the prospect of producing enough crude from Venezuela’s oilfields to drive down the US oil price from more than $56 a barrel today to about $50 in an effort to cut energy costs for consumers, according to the Wall Street Journal, which cited senior Trump administration officials.

Edwin Torres DeSantiago received a text message on Wednesday morning as he was tracking immigration enforcement across Minneapolis – a person was shot by ICE at 34th Street and Portland Avenue.

He jumped into his car to head to the scene. Torres DeSantiago manages the Immigrant Defense Network, a group that monitors ICE activity and responds to community needs after someone is taken. He has responded to dozens of scenes in the past few months, and even more in the last few days since the federal government surged its presence in the midwestern city.

CES 2026 in Las Vegas has been dominated by two things: the next generation of AI compute and a sudden explosion of credible humanoid robots.

While Tesla isn’t officially exhibiting on the floor, Elon Musk has been actively monitoring the event from X. His reactions, and lack thereof, to the major announcements give us a fascinating look into how Tesla views the rapidly crowding field of autonomy.

Musk was quick to comment on NVIDIA’s major push into embedded AI for autonomous systems, but he has been noticeably quiet regarding the masterclass put on by Hyundai and Boston Dynamics.

      <source:markdown>Administration has alleged fraud in decision to halt grants from California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota and New York

Donald [Trump’s administration](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration) said Tuesday that it is withholding funding for programs that support needy families with children in five Democratic-led states over concerns about fraud.

The US Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the program, will require the states to provide extra documentation to access the funds.

The child care and development fund subsidizes day care for low-income households, enabling parents to work or go to school.

Temporary assistance for needy families provides cash assistance and job training so parents in poverty can afford diapers and clothes and earn paychecks.

The social services block grant, a much smaller fund, supports several different social service programs.

Good morning.

Donald Trump and his advisers are looking at “a range of options” in [an effort to acquire Greenland](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/06/trump-greenland-control-us-military), noting in a White House statement on Tuesday that using the US military to do so is “always an option”.

**How are the US’s European allies responding?** In a show of solidarity on Tuesday, the leaders of France, Germany, the UK and other countries issued a joint statement with the prime minister of Denmark, Mette Frederiksen, urging the US to respect its sovereignty. They said Arctic security was a top priority for Nato, a defense alliance that includes the US and Greenland. “Greenland belongs to its people,” the statement said.

**What would a deal of this kind signify?** Top Venezuelan officials have called Maduro’s capture a kidnapping and accused the US of trying to steal the country’s vast oil reserves. However, Tuesday’s agreement is a strong sign that the government is responding to Trump’s demand that it [open up](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2026/jan/06/trump-us-taxpayers-oil-firms-venezuela-investment) to US oil companies or risk more military intervention.

The bombshell announcement that the Trump administration no longer fully recommends [a third of childhood vaccines](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2026/jan/05/trump-rfk-jr-child-vaccine-recommendations) means the US moved from leading globally on vaccination to lagging behind other high-income nations in preventing disease, experts say.

The move is the latest and most significant escalation against vaccines from Robert F Kennedy Jr, a longtime vaccine skeptic and current secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

When the US was confirmed as a future World Cup co-host on the eve of the 2018 tournament in Russia, the USMNT were still stuck under the rubble of their shocking failure to qualify. Mauricio Pochettino was just establishing himself among European club soccer’s managerial elite, taking Tottenham to the Champions League final a year later.

Few could have imagined that he’d be leading the USMNT into the 2026 World Cup, and perhaps fewer believe he’ll stick around for the next cycle.

      <source:markdown>Revelation comes as a first-in-the-nation citizen’s ballot initiative to ban donations by utilities picks up steam

That has created a scenario in which utilities throughout 2025 have cut checks for lawmakers around the time of controversial votes, but the lawmakers sometimes still have not reported receiving the contribution or report it much later.

      <source:markdown>Forecast of Europe’s ‘civilisational erasure’ was part of call for pro-growth reform, says Trump official

Donald Trump’s administration has doubled down on its recent criticism of Europe, saying last month’s [US national security strategy](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/05/civilisational-erasure-us-strategy-document-appears-to-echo-far-right-conspiracy-theories-about-europe) was an attempt to “jolt” an ally back to economic life.

The document was widely condemned in Europe as representing a seismic shift in the 70-year transatlantic alliance with its dark references to a purported [threat of “civilisational erasure”](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/09/trump-europe-national-security-strategy) with migration and censorship creating “strife”, “cratering birthrates” and “loss of national identities”.

The theory sounds straightforward. Venezuela [has vast oil reserves](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2026/jan/04/venezuela-oil-industry-bust-what-role-could-the-us-play) and used to produce more than three times as much volume as it does now. Therefore it should be a simple matter to upgrade the crumbling kit with an injection of dollars and watch the extra barrels and profits flow.

That, roughly speaking, is the only clear part of Donald Trump’s plan for what happens next in Venezuela. “We’re going to have our very large US oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure – the oil infrastructure – and start making money for the country,” he said at the weekend.

Just days after a covert mission to [capture](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/03/explosions-reported-venezuela-caracas) Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro and [strike](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/03/caracas-on-edge-in-aftermath-of-us-blitz-venezuela) the capital city, Hegseth announced that Kelly faces retirement grade determination proceedings, a rare administrative action that could see the former astronaut and navy captain demoted in his retired rank. Hegseth accused Kelly of making “ [seditious](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/20/democrats-condemn-trump-military-video-post) statements” that undermined military discipline.

A UK minister would not be drawn into saying whether his government believes the US capture of Venezuela’s president was influenced by **the country’s rich oil reserves**.

Asked on Sky News why he thought Donald Trump had captured **Nicolás Maduro** and said America would “run” Venezuela, Home Office minister **Mike Tapp** said:

_**This is for Donald Trump to answer**, and I think he has said in his press conference, which I watched with interest around narco-terrorism and that threat._

Discontent at Manchester United these days is only ever deferred. Ruben Amorim’s [departure from the club](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2026/jan/05/ruben-amorim-sacked-by-manchester-united-transfers-power-struggle) on Monday was long anticipated and came, in the end, with a weary sigh.

And so another manager, the seventh since Sir Alex Ferguson left in 2013, falls victim to the United meat-grinder.

Everybody at United, fundamentally, is unhappy. And not unhappy in the sense that Alex Ferguson used to be unhappy, when the club was essentially fuelled by his volcanic rages, but enervated, frustrated by the realisation that this is not how things used to be, that this was once the biggest football club in the country and now they keep failing to get the win they need to lift them to fifth.

      <source:markdown>Voters will choose secretaries of state in contests that could play key role in outcome of 2028 presidential election

When Americans go to cast ballots in the midterm elections in 2026, much of the attention is likely to be on races for the US House, Senate and governorships – contests that will serve as a referendum on [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump)’s first two years in office and determine the trajectories of the final ones.

But further down the ballot, voters will choose secretaries of state in key races that could have a major effect on how elections are run in many US states, including several battleground states that are key to the 2028 presidential race. Twenty-six states are set to choose secretaries of state next year, including the presidential battlegrounds of Nevada, Arizona and Michigan.

      <source:markdown>Analysts and investors voice caution about tech valuations and Trump’s influence on the US central bank

The Venezuelan oil industry has been “a total bust” for a long time, according to Donald Trump.

      <source:markdown>Donald Trump says US will ‘run’ Venezuela as Nicolás Maduro and wife Cilia Flores are flown to New York

The US president, Donald Trump, has said the US will ‘run’ Venezuela after its president, Nicolás Maduro, and his wife, Cilia Flores, were captured and taken to New York, hours after a “large-scale” pre-dawn assault on Caracas and the surrounding region. Here is what we know so far:

Donald Trump said **“We’re going to run the country**\[Venezuela\] until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition” during a press conference about the attack on Venezuela. He has not given details.

**A plane carrying Maduro and Flores landed in New York on Saturday evening** and they were expected to be transported to appear in Manhattan federal court, possibly as soon as Monday.

**The** **US is going to be “very strongly involved” in Venezuela’s oil industry after the military operation** **, Trump** **said.** He said: “We have the greatest oil companies in the world, the biggest, the greatest, and we’re going to be very much involved in it.”

**Trump posted a photograph of Maduro on his Truth Social platform.** It appeared to show the captured Venezuelan president in handcuffs, wrap-around sun goggles and headphones.

**The** **UN security council** is [due to hold](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2026/jan/03/caracas-explosions-venezuela-maduro-latest-news-updates-live?page=with%3Ablock-69597e098f083c44d70df0a0#block-69597e098f083c44d70df0a0) an emergency meeting on Monday.

Trump said his administration **had not spoken to Venezuela’s exiled opposition leader** **María Corina Machado**. He said he did not think she would be able to return to lead Venezuela, saying: “She does not have the support in Venezuela. She is a very nice woman but she does not have the support.”

The constitutional chamber of Venezuela’s supreme court has ordered **vice president Delcy Rodríguez** to assume the role of acting president in Maduro’s absence.

**Trump was asked about Cuba** during the press conference on Venezuela. He said “Cuba, as you know, is not doing very well right now. That system has not been a very good one for Cuba. The people there have suffered for many, many years and I think Cuba is going to be something we’ll end up talking about, because Cuba is a failing nation right now.”

The **US Department of Justice released a new indictment** against Nicolás Maduro, including his wife, Celia Flores, his son and others.

**The US vice-president, JD Vance, hailed what he called a “truly impressive operation”** **.** Resharing Trump’s post about the action, Vance [wrote](https://x.com/JDVance/status/2007447083909841398): “The president offered multiple off-ramps, but was very clear throughout this process: the drug trafficking must stop, and the stolen oil must be returned to the United States.”

**In a statement on X, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said Maduro** **was “under indictment for pushing drugs in the United States”.** The Republican senator Mike Lee said on Saturday that Rubio had told him he “anticipates no further action in Venezuela now that Maduro is in US custody”.

The **UN secretary general, António Guterres, is deeply alarmed by US military action in Venezuela**, his spokesperson has said, and considered the US intervention “a dangerous precedent”.

At a press conference after Maduro’s capture, Donald Trump said that “American dominance in the western hemisphere will never be questioned again”.

- Jackson tops Brittany Bowe in women’s 1,000m


Star speed skater Jordan Stolz shockingly stumbled to the ice right after the start of the men’s 1,000 meters at the US Olympic trials for long track speed skating on Saturday but still finished with the third-fastest time and will head to the Milan Cortina Winter Games.

Stolz caught the toe of one of his skates on the slick surface, lost his footing and tripped after fewer than five strides at the Pettit National Ice Center, about 40 miles south of his hometown of Kewaskum. It was the sort of thing that simply doesn’t happen to the best in the world at what he does – someone expected to earn multiple medals and to be one of the faces of the 6-22 February Olympics.

Zach Charbonnet scored on a 27-yard run in the first quarter and Seattle shut down the high-powered San Francisco offense in a 13-3 victory over the 49ers on Saturday night that secured the No 1 seed for the Seahawks in the NFC playoffs.

Seattle (14-3) won their first division title since 2020 and are now two home wins away from returning to Levi’s Stadium for the Super Bowl next month after besting San Francisco (12-5) in just the fourth season-ending game ever where the winner was guaranteed the No 1 seed in the playoffs.

It’s not yet clear whether there will be an increase in the total number of people who get the flu this season – or whether more people just got it at once in December – but more than 3,100 people died from the virus in the US in the year ending August 2025, according to the [latest data](https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-51.html) from the CDC.

[The US attorney general, Pam Bondi, said on X](https://x.com/AGPamBondi/status/2007428087143686611) that Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, had been indicted in the southern district of New York on charges including narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine importation conspiracy, possession of machine guns and destructive devices, and conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices against the United States.

Zohran Mamdani vowed to “reinvent” New York City in a speech on his first day as mayor, promising “a new era” for America’s largest city and an ambitious start to his term of office.

The 34-year-old political star and democratic socialist, who a year ago was a virtually unknown state assemblyman, is the city’s first Muslim mayor, the first of south Asian descent and the first to be born in Africa. He is also the first to be sworn in using the Qur’an.

      <source:markdown>Blaze that swept through crowded New Year’s Eve bar in Crans-Montana also injured 115 people. Plus, the politicians and advocates making climate policy part of the affordability agenda

Good morning.

Swiss investigators are [racing to identify the victims of a fire](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/01/switzerland-to-hold-five-days-of-mourning-after-dozens-killed-in-resort-fire) that tore through a crowded bar, killing about 40 people and injuring 115 who were celebrating at a New Year’s Eve party in the Alpine ski resort of Crans-Montana.

**How did the fire start?** The fire broke out at 1.30am on Thursday in the town’s Le Constellation bar, but it’s not yet clear what set off the blaze. Some witnesses said it started after sparklers or flares were put into champagne bottles.

**How long will it take to identify the dead?** Swiss police have warned it could take days or even weeks, leaving an agonising wait for family and friends.

**What else did he say?** Mamdani did not shy away from his socialist politics. “I was elected as a democratic socialist and I will govern as a democratic socialist. I will not abandon my principles for fear of being called radical,” he said to loud cheers from the gathered crowd. He ended by saying: “The work has only just begun.”

      <source:markdown>_Hey smarties! Happy New Year. We’re taking a short break for the holidays. In the meantime, we’re sharing an episode from our friends over at “This Is Uncomfortable.” Reema Khrais and the team are getting ready to relaunch the show on Jan. 15. Stay tuned for new episodes!_

When newlyweds Chantal and Travis Lisback started searching for their dream home in Seattle, they weren’t entirely on the same page. Chantal was eager to settle down as soon as possible, while Travis was more comfortable waiting a few years. As the search dragged on, what began as a shared dream started to feel more like a standoff.

This week, a story about how a big life decision can bring to light the money and communication issues you didn’t know were there. Plus, later in the episode, Chantal and Travis sit down with financial therapist [Aja Evans](https://www.instagram.com/ajaetherapy/) to unpack what’s happening beneath the surface, and how to approach money fights with more care and intention.

Donald Trump takes “more aspirin” than his doctors recommend but says his “health is perfect”, according to an [interview](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/as-signs-of-aging-emerge-trump-responds-with-defiance-769c5dcd?st=UqDmm4) given to the Wall Street Journal after the outlet recently questioned the 79-year-old president’s health.

Trump told the Journal that the large dose of aspirin he take daily causes him to bruise easily and that doctors have encouraged him to take a lower dose – but he declined the advice because he has been taking it for 25 years.

In 2024, 55% of Democrats said abortion was important to their vote, according to polling from the Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI).

      <source:markdown>- Miami reaches CFP final four after Cotton Bowl shock

- Scott’s pick-six turns game against Buckeyes

- Hurricanes one win from title game at home


Keionte Scott peeked over at the Miami sideline to see the reaction of his teammates as he sprinted 72 yards untouched for a touchdown returning an interception against defending national champion Ohio State.

They certainly were excited, as were a Pro Football Hall of Fame receiver and a former coach who won national championships with the Hurricanes.

The $2bn (£1.5bn) of aid the [US pledged this week](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/29/us-pledge-un-model-humanitarian-assistance) may have been hailed as [“bold and ambitious”](https://reliefweb.int/report/world/ocha-managed-humanitarian-funds-receive-landmark-us2-billion-contribution-united-states) by the UN but could be the “nail in the coffin” in changing to a shrunken, less flexible aid system dominated by Washington’s political priorities, aid experts fear.

After a year of [deep cuts in aid budgets](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/dec/21/sweden-and-germany-slash-aid-budgets-to-focus-on-ukraine-and-defence-spending) by the US and European countries, the announcement of new money for the humanitarian system is a source of some relief, but experts are deeply concerned about demands that the US has imposed on how the money should be managed and where it can go.

      <source:markdown>As the Trump administration derides climate policy as a ‘scam’, emissions-cutting measures are gaining popularity

A group of progressive politicians and advocates are reframing emissions-cutting measures as a form of economic populism as the [Trump administration](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration) derides climate policy as a “scam” and fails to deliver on promises to tame energy costs and inflation.

Climate politics were once cast as a test of moral resolve, calling on Americans to accept higher costs to avert environmental catastrophe, but that ignores how rising temperatures themselves drive up costs for working people, said Stevie O’Hanlon, co-founder of the youth-led Sunrise Movement.

      <source:markdown>Democratic socialist mayor led historic push to lead New York, speaking on immigration, Trump and subway burritos

[Zohran Mamdani](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/zohran-mamdani), the democratic socialist who is now mayor of [New York City](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york), ran a campaign known for its soaring political rhetoric, its [viral memes](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/20/zohran-mamdani-social-media-viral-videos) and its candidate’s witty quips.

Here are some of the quotes that came to define his [historic](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/06/zohran-mamdani-campaign-new-york-democrats) [push](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/23/zohran-mamdani-new-york-city-mayor-race-viral) to lead one of the world’s most important cities:

New York will remain a city of immigrants: a city built by immigrants, powered by immigrants, and, as of tonight, led by an immigrant. So hear me, President Trump, when I say this: to get to any of us, you will have to get through all of us.

What I don’t have in experience, I make up for in integrity. And what you don’t have in integrity, you could never make up for with experience.

No more will New York be a city where you can traffic in Islamophobia and win an election.

It’s pronounced ‘cyclist’.

I am young, despite my best efforts to grow older. I am Muslim. I am a democratic socialist. And most damning of all, I refuse to apologize for any of this.

I don’t think that we should have billionaires because, frankly, it is so much money in a moment of such inequality, and ultimately, what we need more of is equality across our city and across our state and across our country.

I hear you. I see you. And if you’re a burrito on the Q train, I eat you.

If anyone can show a nation betrayed by Donald Trump how to defeat him, it is the city that gave rise to him. So, if there is any way to terrify a despot, it is by dismantling the very conditions that allowed him to accumulate power. This is not only how we stop Trump, it’s how we stop the next one. So, Donald Trump, since I know you’re watching, I have four words for you: turn the volume up!

      <source:markdown>The continent’s problems are not caused by immigration or cultural politics but by economic and technological decline

Donald Trump’s new [national security strategy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-National-Security-Strategy.pdf) offers a misguided assessment of Europe, long regarded as the US’s most reliable ally. Unrestrained immigration and other policies derided by administration officials as “woke”, it warns, could lead to “civilisational erasure” within a few decades.

That argument rests on a fundamental misreading of Europe’s current predicament. While the EU does face an existential threat, it has little to do with immigration or cultural politics. In fact, the share of foreign-born residents in the [US](https://usafacts.org/answers/how-many-immigrants-are-in-the-us/country/united-states/) is slightly higher than [in Europe](https://www.rfberlin.com/immigrant-population-eu/).

[Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump) has staged a sudden climbdown from his attempts to impose federal troops in law enforcement roles on Democratic-run cities, announcing on Wednesday that he was ending attempted deployments from Los Angeles, Chicago and Portland.

A newly unsealed order in the criminal case against [Kilmar Ábrego García](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/kilmar-abrego-garcia) reveals that high-level justice department officials pushed for his indictment, calling it a “top priority”, only after he was mistakenly deported and then ordered returned to the U.S.

      <source:markdown>Lawyers for Brian Cole argue he should be released ahead of trial for allegedly planting devices in DC in 2021

The man accused of planting pipe bombs outside the headquarters of both the [Democratic](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats) and [Republican](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans) national committees the night before the [January 6 insurrection](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-capitol-breach) at the US Capitol appeared at a federal detention hearing before a magistrate judge on Tuesday.

Earlier this month, authorities arrested Brian Cole Jr of Woodbridge, [Virginia](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/virginia). He has yet to enter a plea. Cole’s lawyers argued that he should be released while he awaits trial, as he does not present any danger. They also noted that Cole had agreed to home detention enforced by GPS monitoring, and would live under the supervision of a relative. The defense rebuked federal prosecutors who pushed for the suspect to remain in custody.

Even some of those who supported the rate cut acknowledged “the decision was finely balanced or that they could have supported keeping the target range unchanged”, given the different risks facing the US economy, according to the minutes released on Tuesday.

In a major study [released recently in Epidemiology](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/08/health/school-closures-mental-health.html), conclusions were drawn – yet again – regarding how shutdowns and online learning were ultimately very damaging to kids’ emotional and mental health (obviously some cohorts of kids were more affected than others with financial security a big part of the calculation). This is no major surprise as parents and students alike weren’t happy with the remote learning environment.

Yet despite this general consensus about online schooling not being as healthy as regular school, a new trend has exploded since Covid: the rapid growth of online schooling for tennis players and other athletes. Parents and their junior athletes feel that by being able to play several hours in the day instead of after school it will accelerate their progress in the sport while still leaving room for academics. And from my perspective, as a parent of a competitive tennis player who attends a “regular” school, it appears to be the rule, not the exception, that most advanced junior players are in online school and not in a physical building.

      <source:markdown>As the billionaire retires, he leaves memorable advice from his annual letters that include pithy takes on bubbles, discipline and long-term goals

Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor [who is retiring at the end of 2025](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/03/warren-buffett-retirement-berkshire-hathaway), has entertained and educated shareholders in his Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate for many years with his pithy annual letters outlining the firm’s performance.

Every year since 1965 he has updated his investors on the journey as Berkshire morphed from a “struggling northern textile business” with $25m of shareholder equity when he took over, to an empire worth more than $1tn.

Though the price I paid for Berkshire looked cheap, its business – a large northern textile operation – was headed for extinction.

My error caused Berkshire shareholders to give far more than they received (a practice that – despite the biblical endorsement – is far from blessed when you are buying businesses).

Woody Allen once explained why eclecticism works: ‘The real advantage of being bisexual is that it doubles your chances for a date on Saturday night.’

When such a CEO is encouraged by his advisers to make deals, he responds much as would a teenage boy who is encouraged by his father to have a normal sex life. It’s not a push he needs.

Andrew destroyed a few small insurers. Beyond that, it awakened some larger companies to the fact that their reinsurance protection against catastrophes was far from adequate. (It’s only when the tide goes out that you learn who’s been swimming naked.)

In our view, however, derivatives are financial weapons of mass destruction, carrying dangers that, while now latent, are potentially lethal.

Participants seeking to dodge troubles face the same problem as someone seeking to avoid venereal disease: it’s not just whom you sleep with, but also whom they are sleeping with.

From this irritating reality comes the first law of corporate survival for ambitious CEOs who pile on leverage and run large and unfathomable derivatives books: modest incompetence simply won’t do; it’s mind-boggling screw-ups that are required.

When downpours of that sort occur, it’s imperative that we rush outdoors carrying washtubs, not teaspoons. And that we will do.

Naturally, I was delighted to attend Mrs B’s birthday party. After all, she’s promised to attend _my_ 100th.

She sold me our interest when she was 89 and worked until she was 103. (After retiring, she died the next year, a sequence I point out to any other Berkshire manager who even thinks of retiring.)

The candidates are young to middle-aged, well-to-do to rich, and all wish to work for Berkshire for reasons that go beyond compensation.

(I’ve reluctantly discarded the notion of my continuing to manage the portfolio after my death – abandoning my hope to give new meaning to the term ‘thinking outside the box’.)

      <source:markdown>This live blog is now closed.

**Benjamin Netanyahu** is expected to tell **Donald Trump** on Monday that **Hamas must return the remains of the last Israeli hostage left in Gaza before the next stages of the stalled ceasefire can be implemented**, Israeli officials and analysts say.

The trip comes amid a **new push by officials in Washington to force concessions from Israel** to allow progress towards a second stage of the ceasefire in [Gaza](https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza), which began in October after two years of devastating war.

He feels he has a number of cards to play yet and the remains of Gvili is the easiest one to play now but there are others.

Netanyahu knows exactly what he wants for Christmas – more of the same. Israeli troops stay in 51% of Gaza, periodically striking Hamas … without the shadow of withdrawal looming over him. None of this requires a denunciation of the \[Trump\] plan itself and Trump can very easily justify Israel’s extended stay on Hamas’s unwillingness to disarm.

The United States on Monday pledged $2bn in assistance to tens of millions of people facing hunger and disease in more than a dozen countries next year, part of what it said was a new mechanism for the delivery of life-saving assistance following major foreign aid cuts by the Trump administration.

The US slashed its aid spending this year, and leading western donors such as Germany also pared back assistance as they pivoted to increased defense spending, triggering a severe funding crunch for the UN. The billions of dollars in assistance pledged by Washington on Monday will be overseen by the UN office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs, the state department said, under what it described as new model of assistance agreed with the UN that aims to make aid funding and delivery more efficient and increase accountability for the spending of funds.

In the Philippines, she spent three years providing end-of-life care for a family’s grandmother. When the grandmother died, family members told the healthcare worker to arrange her own way to the United States, where they operated home healthcare facilities.

In California, they promised, she would have a place to stay and a stable job. They would look after her just as she had cared for their grandmother.

Copper, the metal that underpins the fast-growing renewable energy industry, is on course for its biggest annual price rise in more than 15 years as traders react to fears of global shortages.

As one of the main beneficiaries of the [“electrification of everything”](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/apr/01/every-household-will-go-on-a-journey-of-electrification-we-can-make-that-easier-or-harder), copper has soared by more than 35% in value this year, spurred by US tariff uncertainty and concerns about mining disasters that could restrict supply.

When news broke that Rob and Michele Singer Reiner had been killed and a possible suspect was their son, Nick Reiner, who had struggled with addiction and mental health issues, it brought addiction back into the public spotlight. But parents who have been affected by their children’s addiction fear the conversation will focus on the exceedingly rare act of violence instead of the more widespread risks.

In the past decade at the forefront of US politics, Donald Trump has unleashed a barrage of unusual, misleading or dubious assertions about the climate crisis, which he most famously called a “hoax”.

This year has seen Trump ratchet up his often questionable claims about the environment and how to deal, if at all, with the threats to it. In a year littered with lies and wild declarations, these are the five that stood out as the most startling.

      <source:markdown>Exclusive poll: Americans are also increasingly blaming the White House for their financial woes

Twice as many Americans believe their financial security is getting worse than better, according to an exclusive new poll conducted for the Guardian, and they are increasingly blaming the White House.

The poll, conducted by Harris, will be a further blow to Donald Trump’s efforts to fight off criticism of his handling of the economy and contains some worrying findings for the president.

Nearly half (45%) of Americans said their financial security is getting worse compared to 20% who said it’s getting better.

57% of Americans said the US economy is undergoing a recession, up 11% from a similar poll that was conducted in February.

The “time has come” for the Working Families party, the progressive third party’s national director said after a year of big wins and a growing hunger among voters for a home outside the two major political parties.

Inglewood, California – a few miles east of Los Angeles international airport – is known as the city of champions. The NBA champion Lakers once called Inglewood’s Forum – famously dubbed “the fabulous Forum” by announcer Chick Hearn – home.

By the mid-2000s, with the Lakers gone and another local landmark – nearby Hollywood Park racetrack – closed, the city was close to bankruptcy. Then came a series of deals – often attributed to the leadership of the mayor James Butts – that reinvigorated the city, as a new epicenter of sports and entertainment such as the new spaceship-like SoFi Stadium and the Intuit Dome.

As told in court documents reviewed by [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/oklahoma-man-fatally-shooting-woman-target-practicing-backyard-rcna251138), the death of Sandra Phelps at the hands of Cody Wayne Adams illustrates how deadly the consequences can be when those engaging in the US’s prevalent gun culture do so unsafely.

For years, Tesla Powerwall has been the go-to recommendation for “normals” looking for a painless, low-effort experience from their first home solar and battery backup solutions.

The 19 December deadline for the justice department to comply with a new law the California representative wrote was ticking closer – and his bill wasalready forcing sealed documents about [Jeffrey Epstein](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein)’s sex-trafficking operation into full view.

In the weeks leading up to the deadline, three federal judges in Florida and New York had reversed years of secrecy, releasing grand jury testimony they had previously kept sealed.

By the mid-2000s, [Jeffrey Epstein](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein)’s sexual abuse of teen girls was routine. From 2002 to 2005 alone, the late financier victimized “dozens” of underage teens by luring them into sex acts for payment under the auspices of massage work, some as young as 14, prosecutors said.

Epstein leaned on a coterie of employees and associates – including British socialite [Ghislaine Maxwell](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ghislaine-maxwell) – to secure a “steady supply of minor victims”. He also enlisted his victims to recruit other girls under the false pretense of providing massages, prosecutors said.

Next month, Donald Trump will welcome a poverty-stricken family to peruse his plans for a $300m glitzy state ballroom in the White House. The event will be staged as part of National Poverty in America Awareness Month, the time every year when charities document the number of US residents surviving on low incomes.

Of course, the president will do no such thing, preferring to summon the press to watch him rub shoulders with the billionaire class as he did at last month’s black tie [dinner for the Saudi ruler](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/18/trump-bin-salman-visit-jamal-khashoggi) and his entourage.

A mix of snow and ice bore down on the US north-east early on Saturday, disrupting post-holiday weekend airline traffic and prompting officials in [New York](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york) and [New Jersey](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-jersey) to issue weather emergency declarations even as the storm ebbed by mid-morning.

More than 14,400 domestic US flights on Saturday were canceled or delayed as of mid-morning, with the majority in the New York area, including at John F Kennedy international airport, LaGuardia airport and Newark Liberty international airport, according to the tracking site FlightAware.

      <source:markdown>Rule allows minority party to block legislation, but GOP is reluctant to scrap it as they could lose majority

[Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump) has floated the idea of ending the filibuster – a procedural technique in [Congress](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-congress) that allows a minority of senators to block legislation from passing – which would make pushing through his political agenda in 2026 much easier.

In an interview with [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/27/trump-to-politico-midterm-elections-will-be-about-pricing-00706877), the president urged [Republicans](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans) in the [Senate](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-senate) to scrap the filibuster, saying it had become an obstacle to effective governing and removing it would prevent another government shutdown and pave the way for his party to push through its legislative priorities.

The president of the Kennedy Center has demanded $1m in damages and fiercely criticized a musician’s sudden decision to cancel a Christmas Eve performance at the venue days after the White House announced that Donald Trump’s name would be added to the facility.

“Your decision to withdraw at the last moment – explicitly in response to the Center’s recent renaming, which honors President Trump’s extraordinary efforts to save this national treasure – is classic intolerance and very costly to a non-profit Arts institution,” the venue’s president, Richard Grenell, wrote in a letter to musician Chuck Redd that was shared with the Associated Press.

      <source:markdown>By puncturing Oklahoma City’s aura of inevitability, Victor Wembanyama and co have restored suspense, drama and joy to a season that was in danger of becoming dull

I’ve seen enough: Give the San Antonio Spurs the keys to Santa Claus’ workshop. Put Stephon Castle in charge of toy assembly. Let De’Aaron Fox toss presents into chimneys, from whatever range he’d like. Devin Vassell can customize the Christmas cookies. Harrison Barnes has the army of elves covered. And, of course, Santa Claus’s sleigh must immediately be resized for a taller, thinner pilot so that the towering Victor Wembanyama can drive it comfortably. The sensational Spurs have felled the Oklahoma City Thunder [three times in two weeks](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/25/nba-christmas-games-scores), and in doing so revitalized this NBA season. I now have more faith in the Spurs’ ability to grant joy to the masses than any holiday legends of old.

A [Kentucky](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/kentucky) congressman singled out by [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump) on Christmas as a “lowlife” after co-authoring a law requiring the federal government to release all of its [Jeffrey Epstein](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein) files says the president attacked him for keeping a commitment to “help victims”.

Thomas Massie then successfully sought donations for his run for another term in the 2026 midterm elections against an opponent that Trump – his fellow Republican – has already endorsed.

It’s official. The word “sustainable” is gone from Tesla’s mission statement.

For over a decade, Tesla’s guiding star was arguably the most impactful corporate mission statement of the 21st century. But over the last few years, we have watched the company slowly drift away from its environmental roots.

Now, Elon Musk has confirmed the final step in that divorce, rebranding the company’s goal from “Sustainable Abundance” to simply “Amazing Abundance.”

      <source:markdown>The president’s professed satisfaction with his cabinet may reflect how hard it would be to get a replacement confirmed

For more than a decade he built his brand on two words: “You’re fired!” And in his first term in the White House, [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump) did not hesitate to show his staff the door, often via an abrasive tweet.

But since resuming the US presidency in January, Trump, the former host of the reality TV show [The Apprentice](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/10/trump-the-apprentice-president-elect-reality-tv), appears to have become an uncharacteristically bashful boss, more disposed to hiring than firing.

For half a century, psychedelics largely belonged to the cultural left: anti-war, anti-capitalist, suspicious of the church and state. Now, one of the most politically consequential psychedelic drugs in the US – ibogaine – is being championed by evangelical Christians, Republican governors, military veterans, and big tech billionaires.

Many of them see ibogaine, an intense psychedelic derived from a central African rootbark, as a divine technology. In fact, some pointedly do not refer to it as a psychedelic, given the apparent baggage of the term in some circles.

      <source:markdown>After the writers’ and actors’ strikes, the pandemic, and structural shifts in technology, LA’s trying to find its footing in a changed industry

The veteran Hollywood cinematographer Bruce McCleery knows all about Los Angeles’s struggles to maintain its dominance in the entertainment industry, because for most of the past 16 years he has lived on the road, never short of work but unable to land a major job within striking distance of his home and family in southern California.

It’s an increasingly common experience for many successful professionals in Hollywood who are hired by studios and production houses still largely based in Los Angeles, but do the actual work in Atlanta, or Toronto, or London, or Budapest.

Whatever the worst-case scenario, [Janessa Goldbeck](https://vvfnd.org/about/our-team/) has probably imagined it. In 2023 the US marine veteran consulted on a documentary that war-gamed a presidential candidate staging a military coup.
