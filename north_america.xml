The deputy director of the US’s biggest Muslim civil rights and advocacy group warns that Republican governors’ steps to declare his organization a “terrorist organization” won’t stop with the Muslim community.

The US president, Donald Trump, has said the US will ‘run’ Venezuela after its president, Nicolás Maduro, and his wife, Cilia Flores, were captured and taken to New York, hours after a “large-scale” pre-dawn assault on Caracas and the surrounding region. Here is what we know so far:

Donald Trump said **“We’re going to run the country**\[Venezuela\] until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition” during a press conference about the attack on Venezuela. He has not given details.

**A plane carrying Maduro and Flores landed in New York on Saturday evening** and they were expected to be transported to appear in Manhattan federal court, possibly as soon as Monday.

**The** **US is going to be “very strongly involved” in Venezuela’s oil industry after the military operation** **, Trump** **said.** He said: “We have the greatest oil companies in the world, the biggest, the greatest, and we’re going to be very much involved in it.”

**Trump posted a photograph of Maduro on his Truth Social platform.** It appeared to show the captured Venezuelan president in handcuffs, wrap-around sun goggles and headphones.

**The** **UN security council** is [due to hold](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2026/jan/03/caracas-explosions-venezuela-maduro-latest-news-updates-live?page=with%3Ablock-69597e098f083c44d70df0a0#block-69597e098f083c44d70df0a0) an emergency meeting on Monday.

Trump said his administration **had not spoken to Venezuela’s exiled opposition leader** **María Corina Machado**. He said he did not think she would be able to return to lead Venezuela, saying: “She does not have the support in Venezuela. She is a very nice woman but she does not have the support.”

The constitutional chamber of Venezuela’s supreme court has ordered **vice president Delcy Rodríguez** to assume the role of acting president in Maduro’s absence.

**Trump was asked about Cuba** during the press conference on Venezuela. He said “Cuba, as you know, is not doing very well right now. That system has not been a very good one for Cuba. The people there have suffered for many, many years and I think Cuba is going to be something we’ll end up talking about, because Cuba is a failing nation right now.”

The **US Department of Justice released a new indictment** against Nicolás Maduro, including his wife, Celia Flores, his son and others.

**The US vice-president, JD Vance, hailed what he called a “truly impressive operation”** **.** Resharing Trump’s post about the action, Vance [wrote](https://x.com/JDVance/status/2007447083909841398): “The president offered multiple off-ramps, but was very clear throughout this process: the drug trafficking must stop, and the stolen oil must be returned to the United States.”

**In a statement on X, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said Maduro** **was “under indictment for pushing drugs in the United States”.** The Republican senator Mike Lee said on Saturday that Rubio had told him he “anticipates no further action in Venezuela now that Maduro is in US custody”.

The **UN secretary general, António Guterres, is deeply alarmed by US military action in Venezuela**, his spokesperson has said, and considered the US intervention “a dangerous precedent”.

The US bombardment of Venezuela and the capture of its president, Nicolás Maduro, follow a long history of interventions in South and Central America and the Caribbean over the past two centuries. But they also mark an unprecedented moment as the first direct US military attack on a South American country.

At a press conference after Maduro’s capture, Donald Trump said that “American dominance in the western hemisphere will never be questioned again”.

- Jackson tops Brittany Bowe in women’s 1,000m


Star speed skater Jordan Stolz shockingly stumbled to the ice right after the start of the men’s 1,000 meters at the US Olympic trials for long track speed skating on Saturday but still finished with the third-fastest time and will head to the Milan Cortina Winter Games.

Stolz caught the toe of one of his skates on the slick surface, lost his footing and tripped after fewer than five strides at the Pettit National Ice Center, about 40 miles south of his hometown of Kewaskum. It was the sort of thing that simply doesn’t happen to the best in the world at what he does – someone expected to earn multiple medals and to be one of the faces of the 6-22 February Olympics.

Seattle (14-3) won their first division title since 2020 and are now two home wins away from returning to Levi’s Stadium for the Super Bowl next month after besting San Francisco (12-5) in just the fourth season-ending game ever where the winner was guaranteed the No 1 seed in the playoffs.

Over the course of two decades, [Jeffrey Epstein](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein) repeatedly appeared on law enforcement’s radar for sexual misconduct involving teen girls and young women.

      <source:markdown>New mayor gives speech at inauguration and rescinds all orders signed by Eric Adams after corruption indictment

Zohran Mamdani vowed to “reinvent” New York City in a speech on his first day as mayor, promising “a new era” for America’s largest city and an ambitious start to his term of office.

The 34-year-old political star and democratic socialist, who a year ago was a virtually unknown state assemblyman, is the city’s first Muslim mayor, the first of south Asian descent and the first to be born in Africa. He is also the first to be sworn in using the Qur’an.

      <source:markdown>Blaze that swept through crowded New Year’s Eve bar in Crans-Montana also injured 115 people. Plus, the politicians and advocates making climate policy part of the affordability agenda

Good morning.

Swiss investigators are [racing to identify the victims of a fire](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/01/switzerland-to-hold-five-days-of-mourning-after-dozens-killed-in-resort-fire) that tore through a crowded bar, killing about 40 people and injuring 115 who were celebrating at a New Year’s Eve party in the Alpine ski resort of Crans-Montana.

**How did the fire start?** The fire broke out at 1.30am on Thursday in the town’s Le Constellation bar, but it’s not yet clear what set off the blaze. Some witnesses said it started after sparklers or flares were put into champagne bottles.

**How long will it take to identify the dead?** Swiss police have warned it could take days or even weeks, leaving an agonising wait for family and friends.

**What else did he say?** Mamdani did not shy away from his socialist politics. “I was elected as a democratic socialist and I will govern as a democratic socialist. I will not abandon my principles for fear of being called radical,” he said to loud cheers from the gathered crowd. He ended by saying: “The work has only just begun.”

      <source:markdown>_Hey smarties! Happy New Year. We’re taking a short break for the holidays. In the meantime, we’re sharing an episode from our friends over at “This Is Uncomfortable.” Reema Khrais and the team are getting ready to relaunch the show on Jan. 15. Stay tuned for new episodes!_

When newlyweds Chantal and Travis Lisback started searching for their dream home in Seattle, they weren’t entirely on the same page. Chantal was eager to settle down as soon as possible, while Travis was more comfortable waiting a few years. As the search dragged on, what began as a shared dream started to feel more like a standoff.

This week, a story about how a big life decision can bring to light the money and communication issues you didn’t know were there. Plus, later in the episode, Chantal and Travis sit down with financial therapist [Aja Evans](https://www.instagram.com/ajaetherapy/) to unpack what’s happening beneath the surface, and how to approach money fights with more care and intention.

Donald Trump takes “more aspirin” than his doctors recommend but says his “health is perfect”, according to an [interview](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/as-signs-of-aging-emerge-trump-responds-with-defiance-769c5dcd?st=UqDmm4) given to the Wall Street Journal after the outlet recently questioned the 79-year-old president’s health.

Trump told the Journal that the large dose of aspirin he take daily causes him to bruise easily and that doctors have encouraged him to take a lower dose – but he declined the advice because he has been taking it for 25 years.

In 2024, 55% of Democrats said abortion was important to their vote, according to polling from the Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI).

      <source:markdown>- Miami reaches CFP final four after Cotton Bowl shock

- Scott’s pick-six turns game against Buckeyes

- Hurricanes one win from title game at home


Keionte Scott peeked over at the Miami sideline to see the reaction of his teammates as he sprinted 72 yards untouched for a touchdown returning an interception against defending national champion Ohio State.

They certainly were excited, as were a Pro Football Hall of Fame receiver and a former coach who won national championships with the Hurricanes.

The $2bn (£1.5bn) of aid the [US pledged this week](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/29/us-pledge-un-model-humanitarian-assistance) may have been hailed as [“bold and ambitious”](https://reliefweb.int/report/world/ocha-managed-humanitarian-funds-receive-landmark-us2-billion-contribution-united-states) by the UN but could be the “nail in the coffin” in changing to a shrunken, less flexible aid system dominated by Washington’s political priorities, aid experts fear.

After a year of [deep cuts in aid budgets](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/dec/21/sweden-and-germany-slash-aid-budgets-to-focus-on-ukraine-and-defence-spending) by the US and European countries, the announcement of new money for the humanitarian system is a source of some relief, but experts are deeply concerned about demands that the US has imposed on how the money should be managed and where it can go.

      <source:markdown>As the Trump administration derides climate policy as a ‘scam’, emissions-cutting measures are gaining popularity

A group of progressive politicians and advocates are reframing emissions-cutting measures as a form of economic populism as the [Trump administration](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration) derides climate policy as a “scam” and fails to deliver on promises to tame energy costs and inflation.

Climate politics were once cast as a test of moral resolve, calling on Americans to accept higher costs to avert environmental catastrophe, but that ignores how rising temperatures themselves drive up costs for working people, said Stevie O’Hanlon, co-founder of the youth-led Sunrise Movement.

      <source:markdown>Democratic socialist mayor led historic push to lead New York, speaking on immigration, Trump and subway burritos

[Zohran Mamdani](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/zohran-mamdani), the democratic socialist who is now mayor of [New York City](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york), ran a campaign known for its soaring political rhetoric, its [viral memes](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/20/zohran-mamdani-social-media-viral-videos) and its candidate’s witty quips.

Here are some of the quotes that came to define his [historic](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/06/zohran-mamdani-campaign-new-york-democrats) [push](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/23/zohran-mamdani-new-york-city-mayor-race-viral) to lead one of the world’s most important cities:

New York will remain a city of immigrants: a city built by immigrants, powered by immigrants, and, as of tonight, led by an immigrant. So hear me, President Trump, when I say this: to get to any of us, you will have to get through all of us.

What I don’t have in experience, I make up for in integrity. And what you don’t have in integrity, you could never make up for with experience.

No more will New York be a city where you can traffic in Islamophobia and win an election.

It’s pronounced ‘cyclist’.

I am young, despite my best efforts to grow older. I am Muslim. I am a democratic socialist. And most damning of all, I refuse to apologize for any of this.

I don’t think that we should have billionaires because, frankly, it is so much money in a moment of such inequality, and ultimately, what we need more of is equality across our city and across our state and across our country.

I hear you. I see you. And if you’re a burrito on the Q train, I eat you.

If anyone can show a nation betrayed by Donald Trump how to defeat him, it is the city that gave rise to him. So, if there is any way to terrify a despot, it is by dismantling the very conditions that allowed him to accumulate power. This is not only how we stop Trump, it’s how we stop the next one. So, Donald Trump, since I know you’re watching, I have four words for you: turn the volume up!

      <source:markdown>The continent’s problems are not caused by immigration or cultural politics but by economic and technological decline

Donald Trump’s new [national security strategy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-National-Security-Strategy.pdf) offers a misguided assessment of Europe, long regarded as the US’s most reliable ally. Unrestrained immigration and other policies derided by administration officials as “woke”, it warns, could lead to “civilisational erasure” within a few decades.

That argument rests on a fundamental misreading of Europe’s current predicament. While the EU does face an existential threat, it has little to do with immigration or cultural politics. In fact, the share of foreign-born residents in the [US](https://usafacts.org/answers/how-many-immigrants-are-in-the-us/country/united-states/) is slightly higher than [in Europe](https://www.rfberlin.com/immigrant-population-eu/).

It cut federal EV tax credits — up to $7,500 for new cars and $4,000 for used ones. Those incentives had been on the books in some form since 2008 and were expanded during the Biden administration.

Consumers rushed to take advantage before they disappeared, leading to [record high sales](https://www.coxautoinc.com/insights-hub/q3-2025-ev-sales-report-commentary/) earlier this year. But now the market faces an uncertain road ahead.

A wild winter storm brought strong winds, heavy snow and frigid temperatures to the Great Lakes and north-east on Tuesday, a day after a bomb cyclone barreled across the midwest and left tens of thousands of customers without power.

The storm hit parts of the Plains and Great Lakes on Monday with sharply colder air, strong winds and a mix of snow, ice and rain, leading to treacherous travel.

A second jazz band has pulled out of performing at the controversially renamed “Trump-Kennedy” center in Washington DC, giving just two days’ notice before their New Year’s Eve gig was set to take place.

In a major study [released recently in Epidemiology](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/08/health/school-closures-mental-health.html), conclusions were drawn – yet again – regarding how shutdowns and online learning were ultimately very damaging to kids’ emotional and mental health (obviously some cohorts of kids were more affected than others with financial security a big part of the calculation). This is no major surprise as parents and students alike weren’t happy with the remote learning environment.

Yet despite this general consensus about online schooling not being as healthy as regular school, a new trend has exploded since Covid: the rapid growth of online schooling for tennis players and other athletes.

      <source:markdown>As the billionaire retires, he leaves memorable advice from his annual letters that include pithy takes on bubbles, discipline and long-term goals

Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor [who is retiring at the end of 2025](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/03/warren-buffett-retirement-berkshire-hathaway), has entertained and educated shareholders in his Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate for many years with his pithy annual letters outlining the firm’s performance.

Every year since 1965 he has updated his investors on the journey as Berkshire morphed from a “struggling northern textile business” with $25m of shareholder equity when he took over, to an empire worth more than $1tn.

Though the price I paid for Berkshire looked cheap, its business – a large northern textile operation – was headed for extinction.

My error caused Berkshire shareholders to give far more than they received (a practice that – despite the biblical endorsement – is far from blessed when you are buying businesses).

Woody Allen once explained why eclecticism works: ‘The real advantage of being bisexual is that it doubles your chances for a date on Saturday night.’

When such a CEO is encouraged by his advisers to make deals, he responds much as would a teenage boy who is encouraged by his father to have a normal sex life. It’s not a push he needs.

Andrew destroyed a few small insurers. Beyond that, it awakened some larger companies to the fact that their reinsurance protection against catastrophes was far from adequate. (It’s only when the tide goes out that you learn who’s been swimming naked.)

In our view, however, derivatives are financial weapons of mass destruction, carrying dangers that, while now latent, are potentially lethal.

Participants seeking to dodge troubles face the same problem as someone seeking to avoid venereal disease: it’s not just whom you sleep with, but also whom they are sleeping with.

From this irritating reality comes the first law of corporate survival for ambitious CEOs who pile on leverage and run large and unfathomable derivatives books: modest incompetence simply won’t do; it’s mind-boggling screw-ups that are required.

When downpours of that sort occur, it’s imperative that we rush outdoors carrying washtubs, not teaspoons. And that we will do.

Naturally, I was delighted to attend Mrs B’s birthday party. After all, she’s promised to attend _my_ 100th.

She sold me our interest when she was 89 and worked until she was 103. (After retiring, she died the next year, a sequence I point out to any other Berkshire manager who even thinks of retiring.)

The candidates are young to middle-aged, well-to-do to rich, and all wish to work for Berkshire for reasons that go beyond compensation.

(I’ve reluctantly discarded the notion of my continuing to manage the portfolio after my death – abandoning my hope to give new meaning to the term ‘thinking outside the box’.)

**Benjamin Netanyahu** is expected to tell **Donald Trump** on Monday that **Hamas must return the remains of the last Israeli hostage left in Gaza before the next stages of the stalled ceasefire can be implemented**, Israeli officials and analysts say.

The trip comes amid a **new push by officials in Washington to force concessions from Israel** to allow progress towards a second stage of the ceasefire in [Gaza](https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza), which began in October after two years of devastating war.

He feels he has a number of cards to play yet and the remains of Gvili is the easiest one to play now but there are others.

Netanyahu knows exactly what he wants for Christmas – more of the same. Israeli troops stay in 51% of Gaza, periodically striking Hamas … without the shadow of withdrawal looming over him. None of this requires a denunciation of the \[Trump\] plan itself and Trump can very easily justify Israel’s extended stay on Hamas’s unwillingness to disarm.

Two men who died after their helicopters collided midair in New Jersey over the weekend both earned their private pilot licenses over a decade ago and would often have breakfast together at a cafe near the crash site before taking to the skies from the local airport.

Authorities on Monday identified the two New Jersey men as Kenneth Kirsch, 65, and Michael Greenberg, 71. Witnesses told police that the two helicopters they were piloting Sunday were flying close together just before they crashed in a farm field near the airport in Hammonton, about 35 miles (56km) south-east of Philadelphia.

      <source:markdown>Gaza not covered in announcement and will be handled on separate track, says US state department official

The United States on Monday pledged $2bn in assistance to tens of millions of people facing hunger and disease in more than a dozen countries next year, part of what it said was a new mechanism for the delivery of life-saving assistance following major foreign aid cuts by the Trump administration.

The US slashed its aid spending this year, and leading western donors such as Germany also pared back assistance as they pivoted to increased defense spending, triggering a severe funding crunch for the UN. The billions of dollars in assistance pledged by Washington on Monday will be overseen by the UN office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs, the state department said, under what it described as new model of assistance agreed with the UN that aims to make aid funding and delivery more efficient and increase accountability for the spending of funds.

We talk a lot here at _Electrek_ about the exponential growth of electric vehicles and the massive strain that puts on the battery supply chain. Literally, the majority of that demand and production comes from China.

But there is a massive difference between _processing_ materials and actually having them in the ground.

A new image from a gigantic materials mining and recycling company in China, gives us a sobering look at the reality of their domestic reserves. The data suggests that China’s own supply of the most critical battery metals isn’t just running low; in some cases, it’s already gone.

The Las Vegas Raiders made waves this week by putting its two, and only, stars on injured reserve ahead of the final two games that will decide the 2026 NFL draft order.

It might be most generous to characterize the behavior of major US media organizations since 2024 as negotiating between competing incentives.

On the one hand, billionaires have consolidated their ownership over major news outlets and platforms. The Murdochs are squabbling over Fox. Jeff Bezos has remade the Washington Post in his own image. The pharmaceutical magnate Patrick Soon-Shiong places a thumb on the scale at the Los Angeles Times, and the Trump-aligned Ellison family has taken over Paramount and CBS, and spent the final weeks of this year making hostile takeover bids for CNN owner Warner Bros. The influence of these billionaire personalities has often reshaped their organizations’ newsrooms and editorial boards, directing investigations and particularly opinion sections towards ownership’s pet projects and preferred policies.

Trump did raise tariffs to shocking levels, violating [international](https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/250318_Trump-and-the-World-Economy.pdf?x85095) [agreements](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/9ggbn0dgp37jkknk0rxpu/2025-05-13-Jeffrey-Frankel-Taking-a-Sledgehammer-to-US-Global-Leadership-Trump-s-Tariffs.mp4?rlkey=9iw66ek8uh5kyqwnf59ptt6qr&#38;e=2&#38;st=s51qydmr&#38;dl=0ido) and blowing up the Republican party’s [oft-professed](https://cepr.org/voxeu/blogs-and-reviews/protectionism-nothing-new-republicans) commitment to free trade. In terms of severity and disruptiveness, Trump’s 2025 tariffs went far beyond the already harmful tariffs of his [first term](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/america-china-trump-tariffs-economic-cost-by-jeffrey-frankel-2019-05), and even beyond the infamous [Smoot-Hawley Act](https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Senate_Passes_Smoot_Hawley_Tariff.htm) of 1930. According to the Yale Budget Lab, the [average effective tariff](https://budgetlab.yale.edu/research/state-us-tariffs-september-26-2025) on US imports rose from [2% to 18%](https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/trump-tariffs-trade-war/), the highest level since the 1930s, this year. Add to that the uncertainty caused by frequent and inexplicable policy changes, and large [adverse](https://abcnews.go.com/Business/trumps-tariffs-cause-recession-experts/story?id=120329597) effects on inflation, employment and real incomes appeared all but inevitable.

A lot of mainstream auto media coverage right now is pushing the idea that some EVs are “dying.” What we’re _really_ seeing is a wave of end-of-cycle, first-generation vehicles making way for their next-gen replacements — and, historically, that’s when buyers get the best deals.

If that’s what _you’re_ after, these are the EVs you should be looking at right now.

Copper, the metal that underpins the fast-growing renewable energy industry, is on course for its biggest annual price rise in more than 15 years as traders react to fears of global shortages.

As one of the main beneficiaries of the [“electrification of everything”](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/apr/01/every-household-will-go-on-a-journey-of-electrification-we-can-make-that-easier-or-harder), copper has soared by more than 35% in value this year, spurred by US tariff uncertainty and concerns about mining disasters that could restrict supply.

When news broke that Rob and Michele Singer Reiner had been killed and a possible suspect was their son, Nick Reiner, who had struggled with addiction and mental health issues, it brought addiction back into the public spotlight. But parents who have been affected by their children’s addiction fear the conversation will focus on the exceedingly rare act of violence instead of the more widespread risks.

      <source:markdown>Trump ratcheted up his questionable claims about the environment and how to deal, if at all, with the threats to it

In the past decade at the forefront of US politics, Donald Trump has unleashed a barrage of unusual, misleading or dubious assertions about the climate crisis, which he most famously called a “hoax”.

This year has seen Trump ratchet up his often questionable claims about the environment and how to deal, if at all, with the threats to it. In a year littered with lies and wild declarations, these are the five that stood out as the most startling.

      <source:markdown>Exclusive poll: Americans are also increasingly blaming the White House for their financial woes

Twice as many Americans believe their financial security is getting worse than better, according to an exclusive new poll conducted for the Guardian, and they are increasingly blaming the White House.

The poll, conducted by Harris, will be a further blow to Donald Trump’s efforts to fight off criticism of his handling of the economy and contains some worrying findings for the president.

Nearly half (45%) of Americans said their financial security is getting worse compared to 20% who said it’s getting better.

57% of Americans said the US economy is undergoing a recession, up 11% from a similar poll that was conducted in February.

Inglewood, California – a few miles east of Los Angeles international airport – is known as the city of champions. The NBA champion Lakers once called Inglewood’s Forum – famously dubbed “the fabulous Forum” by announcer Chick Hearn – home.

By the mid-2000s, with the Lakers gone and another local landmark – nearby Hollywood Park racetrack – closed, the city was close to bankruptcy. Then came a series of deals – often attributed to the leadership of the mayor James Butts – that reinvigorated the city, as a new epicenter of sports and entertainment such as the new spaceship-like SoFi Stadium and the Intuit Dome. When the 2028 Olympics roll around, Inglewood is slated to host many of the events as the world watches.

A man in [Oklahoma](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/oklahoma) is facing a manslaughter charge after he allegedly shot a woman several blocks from his home while firing a gun he got himself for Christmas at an energy drink can in his back yard.

As told in court documents reviewed by [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/oklahoma-man-fatally-shooting-woman-target-practicing-backyard-rcna251138), the death of Sandra Phelps at the hands of Cody Wayne Adams illustrates how deadly the consequences can be when those engaging in the US’s prevalent gun culture do so unsafely. Adams’s back yard was not equipped to stop bullets from leaving the property and striking unsuspecting people in the surrounding area, according to authorities.

[Democrats’ soul-searching](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/08/democrats-trump-elections) began even before it was clear Donald Trump would return to the White House. But their devastating losses in the 2024 election threw the party’s problems into stark relief, prompting a wave of competing explanations from inflation and the border to Gaza, Joe Biden’s age, Kamala Harris’s clipped campaign, “woke” policies, an anti-incumbent mood or, more likely, some combination of them all.

One diagnosis, however, drew striking consensus: Democrats had allowed themselves to be drowned out online by the right’s vast – and well-funded – digital army.

Nearly 50 years ago, a 13-year-old boarded a tiny fishing boat from communist Vietnam with more than a hundred other people. His intended destination: anywhere but there.

It was mid-December, and Ro Khanna was watching the calendar. The 19 December deadline for the justice department to comply with a new law the California representative wrote was ticking closer – and his bill wasalready forcing sealed documents about [Jeffrey Epstein](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein)’s sex-trafficking operation into full view.

In the weeks leading up to the deadline, three federal judges in Florida and New York had reversed years of secrecy, releasing grand jury testimony they had previously kept sealed. And when the deadline arrived, while the justice department didn’t release everything, thousands of new files, connections and photographs began to complete the picture on what Khanna calls “the Epstein class … rich and powerful men who still have buildings named after them, who still are on corporations, are still in positions of prestige, who engage in heinous conduct.

By the mid-2000s, [Jeffrey Epstein](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein)’s sexual abuse of teen girls was routine. From 2002 to 2005 alone, the late financier victimized “dozens” of underage teens by luring them into sex acts for payment under the auspices of massage work, some as young as 14, prosecutors said.

Epstein leaned on a coterie of employees and associates – including British socialite [Ghislaine Maxwell](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ghislaine-maxwell) – to secure a “steady supply of minor victims”. He also enlisted his victims to recruit other girls under the false pretense of providing massages, prosecutors said.

The FBI director, Kash Patel, said the law enforcement agency’s sprawling but ageing J Edgar Hoover building [in Washington](https://www.yahoo.com/news/fbi-determines-headquarters-remain-dc-213711422.html) DC will be closed down and the agency will move into existing offices elsewhere.

A California family is celebrating their first holiday following the delivery of their latest child, a baby that had been growing outside of the mother’s womb.

Suze Lopez, a 41-year-old emergency room nurse in Bakersfield, California, delivered baby Ryu via surgery in August, so the newborn is celebrating his first Christmas. He had been an ectopic pregnancy – when a fertilized egg implants and grows outside the uterus – and was hidden behind a large ovarian cyst.

The president of the Kennedy Center has demanded $1m in damages and fiercely criticized a musician’s sudden decision to cancel a Christmas Eve performance at the venue days after the White House announced that Donald Trump’s name would be added to the facility.

“Your decision to withdraw at the last moment – explicitly in response to the Center’s recent renaming, which honors President Trump’s extraordinary efforts to save this national treasure – is classic intolerance and very costly to a non-profit Arts institution,” the venue’s president, Richard Grenell, wrote in a letter to musician Chuck Redd that was shared with the Associated Press.

Imran Ahmed, the chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), is [among five European nationals](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/dec/24/us-state-department-visa-ban-former-eu-commissioner-europe) barred from the US by the state department after being accused of seeking to push tech firms to censor or suppress American viewpoints.

In early October, Tracy Wright invited a group of other women in her social circle – all fellow knitters – to gather outside the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in their home town of Portland, Oregon. They were “armed with their weapons of mass construction”.

Donald Trump had just ordered national guard troops deployed to the city, which he called “war ravaged” in order to protect ICE facilities he said were “under siege” by anti-fascists “and other domestic terrorists”.

The US defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, has warned of new strikes against Islamic State targets in north-western Nigeria, hours after the US military took action against militant camps in what Donald Trump has characterised as efforts to stop the killing of Christians.

Hegseth [wrote on X](https://x.com/PeteHegseth/status/2004332431542022289?s=20): “The president was clear last month: the killing of innocent Christians in Nigeria (and elsewhere) must end.

For more than a decade he built his brand on two words: “You’re fired!” And in his first term in the White House, [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump) did not hesitate to show his staff the door, often via an abrasive tweet.

But since resuming the US presidency in January, Trump, the former host of the reality TV show [The Apprentice](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/10/trump-the-apprentice-president-elect-reality-tv), appears to have become an uncharacteristically bashful boss, more disposed to hiring than firing.

For half a century, psychedelics largely belonged to the cultural left: anti-war, anti-capitalist, suspicious of the church and state. Now, one of the most politically consequential psychedelic drugs in the US – ibogaine – is being championed by evangelical Christians, Republican governors, military veterans, and big tech billionaires.

The veteran Hollywood cinematographer Bruce McCleery knows all about Los Angeles’s struggles to maintain its dominance in the entertainment industry, because for most of the past 16 years he has lived on the road, never short of work but unable to land a major job within striking distance of his home and family in southern California.

It’s an increasingly common experience for many successful professionals in Hollywood who are hired by studios and production houses still largely based in Los Angeles, but do the actual work in Atlanta, or Toronto, or London, or Budapest.

“There’s still a lot of recovery that needs to happen, but we’re in much better shape than we were this time last year … sales are good,” Kevin Gray, owner of Hickory Creek Farm Christmas Trees in Greensboro, said earlier this month, while the buying season was in full swing.

An extravagant expression of what was allegedly “true love”, the spree amounted to a total of 364 presents – more if you include the eggs that the geese a-laid.

Any Lucia López Belloza will not be home for Christmas. The 19-year-old freshman was on a business scholarship at Babson College near Boston, when she decided to take a surprise flight home to Austin, Texas, to spend Thanksgiving with her parents and sisters.

Just before she boarded her flight at Logan airport on 20 November, she was [arrested by federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/08/ice-family-college-student-deported-honduras) and within 48 hours was deported back to Honduras, a country she left aged seven seeking asylum, with chains on her waist, ankles and wrists.

Republicans are attempting to exempt some major polluters from paying for Pfas “forever chemical” cleanup. If successful, it could mark a major setback in US effort to rein in Pfas pollution.

The Republican-led House energy and commerce committee recently [held a hearing](https://energycommerce.house.gov/posts/environment-subcommittee-holds-hearing-on-the-current-statutory-and-regulatory-landscape-of-pfas) at which it invited representatives from the water treatment and landfill industries, among others, to make the case about why they should be exempted from rules that hold polluters financially accountable for the cleanup of two types of dangerous Pfas.

Donald Trump’s recent claims that the US should keep Venezuelan oil from seized tankers are part of a broader belief in rightwing “resource imperialism”, experts say.

In recent weeks, the Trump administration has escalated pressure on Venezuela, [invoking](https://x.com/SecWar/status/1989094923497316430) drug-trafficking claims. This month, the US intercepted two tankers carrying Venezuelan oil and began pursuing a third, while intensifying its campaign against the country’s president, Nicolás Maduro.

Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said on Tuesday that guard members, as they have in other deployments in large cities, will be tasked with supporting federal law enforcement partners, including the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security.

      <source:markdown>Trump has shown erratic and bizarre behavior throughout the year, leading to questions about his mental acuity

In an address from the White House in December, Donald Trump [claimed](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2001474404899807408) that, over the past 11 months, his administration had brought “more positive change” than any government in US history.

“There has never been anything like it,” Trump added.

America is respected again as a country. We were not respected with Biden. They looked at him falling down stairs every day. Every day, the guy’s falling down stairs.”

I said: ‘It’s not our president. We can’t have it.’ I’m very careful, you know, when I walk downstairs for – like I’m on stairs, like these stairs, I’m very – I walk very slowly. Nobody has to set a record, just try not to fall because it doesn’t work out well. A few of our presidents have fallen and it became a part of their legacy.

We don’t want that. Need to walk nice and easy. You not have – you don’t have to set any record. Be cool, be cool when you walk down, but don’t, don’t bop down the stairs.

      <source:markdown>It has been a year dominated by Donald Trump. It has not yet even been 12 full months since his return to the White House in January but already the changes he has wrought – both in the US and around the world – seemed scarcely conceivable in 2024.

**Katharine Viner**, the Guardian’s editor-in-chief, tells **Annie Kelly** what it has looked like from the editor’s chair: from the deployment of the national guard on American streets, to the humiliation of Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office, to the erosion of the rules that once governed peace and war.

In the UK, she describes a Labour government failing to tell its story and missing chance after chance to tackle the rise of Reform and the far right. ‘Politics is about timing,’ she says of the government’s notable silence over the summer, ‘and I think a lot of those opportunities were missed.’

It has not been a year without hope, from the unexpected success of leftwing figures such as Zohran Mamdani and Zack Polanski, to the Guardian’s decisive victories in court defending its reporting, in a case described as a landmark ruling for #MeToo journalism.

A newly released batch of the so-called Epstein files on Tuesday includes many references to Donald Trump, including a claim by a senior US attorney that the US president was on a flight in the 1990s with the now-deceased convicted child sex offender and a 20-year-old woman.

There is no indication of whether the woman was a victim of any crime, and being included in the files does not indicate any criminal wrongdoing.

      <source:markdown>Department of Veterans Affairs says justice department found procedure not to be legally sound

The Department of Veterans Affairs can no longer provide abortions to veterans, including in cases of rape or incest, following a Department of Justice memo that found last week that the practice was not legally sound.

The ban follows months of efforts by the Trump administration to roll back a Biden-era policy that, for the first time, permitted the VAto counsel veterans and their families about abortion, as well as offer the procedure in cases of rape or incest, or when a veteran’s pregnancy imperiled their health. In August, [the administration filed paperwork](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/04/trump-abortion-veterans-affairs-hospitals) to officially roll back the policy, which had helped the VA’s network of 1,300-plus healthcare facilities – which treat nearly 10 million veterans each year – expand access to abortion, especially in the wake of the US supreme court’s 2022 overturning of Roe v Wade.

A drag queen Christmas tour has become an annual holiday tradition in Florida – and in recent years, so has the ensuing backlash.

Now in its 11th year, A Drag Queen Christmas, featuring performers from RuPaul’s Drag Race, will stop in the Florida Panhandle city of Pensacola on Tuesday night, despite state officials’ best efforts to cancel the show for what they claim is an “anti-Christian” performance at a city-owned theater.

      <source:markdown>Documents give further insight into former royal’s ties to sex offender and raise fresh questions for Donald Trump

Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor asked Jeffrey Epstein’s fixer Ghislaine Maxwell to arrange meetings with “inappropriate friends” while she sought “friendly and discreet and fun” girls on his behalf, the latest documents from the Epstein files appear to show.

The largest release yet of files concerning the financier and convicted child sex offender – which also raise fresh questions for the US president, Donald Trump – include emails in the name of “A” exchanging detailed messages with Maxwell that appeared to identify the author as Andrew.

Emails recording that Britain’s Metropolitan police contacted the FBI last month to inquire whether there were any ongoing investigations related to the disgraced former prince’s association with Epstein.

Emails showing US lawyers claiming “various factual inaccuracies” in a statement provided on Andrew’s behalf during their investigation of Epstein.

[Multiple references to Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/23/trump-flew-alone-on-jet-with-epstein-and-unnamed-20-year-old-files-suggests), including a claim by a senior US attorney that Trump was on a flight in the 1990s with Epstein and a 20-year-old woman. There is no indication of whether the woman was a victim of any crime, and Trump has consistently denied wrongdoing.

Files featuring redactions that were [found to be removable](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/23/epstein-unredacted-files-social-media) through Photoshop techniques or simply highlighting text to paste into a word processing file.

Good morning.

The number of people in immigration detention in the US has [hit an all-time high](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/22/ice-detentions-record-immigration), according to data published by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

**What are the demographics of people the administration is targeting for deportation?** In one of the biggest changes in immigration enforcement policies, immigrants with [no criminal record](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/21/deportations-us-government-shutdown-ice-data) continue to make up the largest group in US immigration detention, despite the administration’s rhetoric about focusing its anti-immigration efforts on “the worst of the worst” criminals. (Being undocumented in the US is a civil not a criminal infraction.)

**How are ordinary people fighting back?** As Trump carries out his mass deportation operation, [Julia Carrie Wong reports](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/18/ice-raids-fighting-back) on how residents are banding together to block raids and distribute groceries.

**What did Trump say about Clinton?** “I like Bill Clinton,” Trump said after he featured prominently in Friday’s cache of photos. “I hate to see photos come out of him but this is what the Democrats – mostly Democrats and a couple of bad Republicans – are asking for, so they’re giving their photos of me too.”

**Meanwhile, what’s happening on the Hill?** The Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, said yesterday he will introduce [a resolution](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/22/schumer-doj-epstein-senate-legal-action) directing the Senate to take legal action against the justice department – over its incomplete release of files.

The United States has seen a dramatic increase in violence against journalists since Donald Trump again took office.

Most of the reporters and photographers who were allegedly attacked by law enforcement officials were covering protests over the Trump administration’s efforts to deport undocumented immigrants, according to the Freedom of the Press Foundation, a non-profit that tracks such incidents.

Since, the White House has advocated for the build out of AI infrastructure and put a moratorium on state-level AI regulation. But the Trump administration also added a $100,000 fee to petitions for H-1B visas, which are widely used in the tech sector.

To review the year in tech and Trump we called up Suyash Pasi, a research analyst and editor at the nonprofit Human Rights Research Center, who’s been following this shift.</source:markdown>

- Pair have won four NBA championships together


Warriors forward Draymond Green had a heated exchange with his head coach, Steve Kerr, in a third-quarter huddle during Monday night’s win over the Orlando Magic before leaving the court and heading to the locker room to calm down.

“We got into it obviously and I took the timeout just because I thought we lost our focus there a little bit,” Kerr said. “We had it out a little bit and he made his decision to go back to the locker room to cool off and that’s all I’m going to say about it. Everything is private. I’ve got nothing further to add.”

More than 100 organizations that support victims of [human trafficking](https://www.theguardian.com/law/human-trafficking) have lost funding since October, leaving thousands of survivors at risk, a Guardian investigation has found.

Anti-trafficking advocates say the US Department of Justice’s failure to spend nearly $90m appropriated by [Congress](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-congress) is impeding law-enforcement investigations and exposing survivors to homelessness and the risk of deportation, jail time or re-exploitation.

Good morning.

A document among the tranche of newly released Jeffrey Epstein files [casts fresh light](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/22/ghislaine-maxwell-jeffrey-epstein-files) on psychological tricks that his ex-girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell deployed in her effort to lure vulnerable teenage girls into his abusive orbit.

Donald Trump, having promised to “NEVER LET OUR FARMERS DOWN”, appeared to come through for them this month when he unveiled a $12bn aid package. Industry leaders say thousands of farms will still go bust this year.

While the US president has vowed to increase domestic farm production, and even claimed this formed a “big part” of his plan to lower grocery prices for Americans, many US farmers are grappling with mounting financial issues – compounded by Trump’s agenda.

Caleb Williams threw a 46-yard touchdown pass to DJ Moore in overtime, and the Chicago Bears overcame a 10-point deficit late in the fourth quarter Saturday night for a 22-16 win over the Green Bay Packers, who lost quarterback Jordan Love to a concussion.

The Bears (11-4) extended their lead in the NFC North to one and a half games over the Packers (9-5-1) with two left to play and got some payback for a loss at Lambeau Field two weeks earlier. It was Chicago’s sixth win this season after trailing in the final two minutes and its most incredible – Green Bay had a win probability of 99%.

A book titled Massage for Dummies was seen among the partial files released yesterday by the Department of Justice. It is mentioned as one of the “gifts” Epstein gave to a “girl” whose name is redacted.

Various reports say Epstein would often request massages from his victims – for both himself and others in his circle.

Many of the documents in the data dump were heavily redacted, with text blacked out so it was impossible to read. Norm Eisen, executive chair of Democracy Defenders Fund, said: “What they have released is clearly incomplete and appears to be over-redacted to boot.”

The documents extensively featured photos of former president Bill Clinton, a Democrat, and appeared to include few if any photos of Trump or documents mentioning him, despite Trump and Epstein’s well-publicised friendship in the 1990s and early 2000s.

Lawyers for Luigi Mangione are attempting to avoid the death penalty and throw out two federal charges in the justice department’s case against him, arguing that attorney general Pam Bondi is biased because she used to work at a lobbying firm that represents UnitedHealth Group.

In court documents filed on Friday, Mangione’s lawyers said that Bondi has a “profound conflict of interest” because her former employer, Ballard Partners, a DC-based lobbying firm founded by the Trump donor Brian Ballard, counts UnitedHealth Group as one of its clients.

      <source:markdown>Children’s Health Defense using familiar playbook to defend health secretary as it downplays dangers of disease and exaggerate risks of vaccines, public health experts say

The non-profit group that Robert F Kennedy Jr built into a giant of the anti-vaccine movement is defending its old boss even as the US health secretary presides over the worst year for measles [in more than 30 years](https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/32586/CDC-confirms-worst-year-for-measles-since-1992).

Three people have died and 1,958 people have been reported infected with measles in the US this year, according to the [US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html). In [South Carolina](https://dph.sc.gov/diseases-conditions/infectious-diseases/measles-rubeola/2025-measles-outbreak), 224 people are in quarantine amid an outbreak that has sickened 144 people. Most are unvaccinated children.

      <source:markdown>US president has been blatant in his appointment of relatives, close friends and big donors – almost none of whom have diplomatic experience

When your goal is to “help Europe correct its current trajectory” because it is “weak”, “decaying” and facing “civilisational erasure”, your choice of highly trained operatives for the mission is plainly of paramount importance.

In Donald Trump’s case they include: a former burger magnate; his eldest son’s former fiancee; the owner of the Houston Rockets basketball team; a producer of Broadway musicals; PayPal’s co-founder; and a convicted felon who is also his son-in-law’s father.

Democratic lawmakers will release more photographs from evidence gathered from the estate of Jeffrey Epstein if the Department of Justice fails to meet the Friday deadline to disclose investigative documents, Congressman Robert Garcia told CNN yesterday.

Speaking to [Erin Burnett](https://x.com/i/status/2001475597109772655), Garcia said a petition to the federal court by Ghislaine Maxwell – Epstein’s convicted accomplice - to have her conviction on sex trafficking charges thrown out and to obtain a pardon do not trigger an exemption to the law Congress passed mandating a release of documents by the DoJ.

Among them are photographs of what appear to be lines from Vladimir Nabokov’s novel Lolita, which is about a middle-aged man’s sexual obsession with and sexual abuse of a 12-year-old girl, written on different parts of a woman’s body.

The psychodrama is finally done. We can all go to bed vaguely hopeful that the world won’t have taken a further turn for the worse by the time we wake up.

      <source:markdown>First female appointment to a major oil company has faced fierce resistance from climate activists as boss of Woodside

The surprise appointment of BP’s [third chief executive in a tumultuous five years](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/17/bp-names-meg-oneill-as-new-chief-executive) reflects the embattled fossil fuel producer’s need for profound change. The hiring of Meg O’Neill appears to offer exactly that.

The 55-year-old from Boulder, Colorado, is the first female head of a major oil company, and the first “outsider” to be hired to a position usually reserved for company veterans. She joins from the Australian oil and gas company Woodside, where she took up her first chief executive role only four years ago.

As demand for the Cybertruck can’t reach more than about 10% of Tesla’s planned production capacity, Elon Musk used his privately owned company to try to boost demand.

      <source:markdown>As Trump carries out his mass deportation operation, residents are banding together to block raids and distribute groceries

A year into his second term, Donald Trump’s [pledge](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/oct/31/election-trump-immigration-policies) to stage the “largest deportation operation in American history” has already made an indelible mark on the nation.

Nearly 300,000 people have been [deported](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/aug/29/trump-immigration-ice-cbp-data), and a record 65,000 people are being held in detention centers. Aggressive raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents, sometimes with the backing of federalized national guard units, have terrorized immigrant communities from Charlotte to Chicago, New Orleans to New York.

      <source:markdown>Longest federal government shutdown meant data was only collected for second half of November

US prices rose 2.7% in the year to November, according to federal data released a day after [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump) claimed they were falling “very fast” on his watch.

The latest consumer price index, released on Wednesday morning, was down from 3% in September, and short of economists’ expectations of about 3.1% for last month.

In the past, a fan’s ability to attend a World Cup hosted in their nation hinged more on bid books than their checkbooks. For 2026 in the US, Mexico and Canada, even the least expensive tickets are a luxury commodity by comparison.

An analysis by the Guardian of men’s World Cup ticket pricing shows that amid the general rise in ticket prices for the 2026 World Cup, the most extreme of those hikes have often applied to the cheapest tickets. The analysis is based on official Fifa pricing dating back to 1994, with more robust data available starting in 2006. Prices for 2026 games are accurate as of 16 December 2025, and do not include the [1.6% of sellable tickets](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/dec/16/fifa-world-cup-pricing-tier-supporters-entry) for each game that Fifa recently made available for a fixed $60 price.

Smith gave private testimony to the Republican-controlled House judiciary committee following months of disclosures from Trump appointees at the justice department, and Republican lawmakers intended to discredit Smith’s investigation and bolster Trump’s claims that the cases were an abuse of the legal system.

      <source:markdown>Experts decry Jason Reding Quiñones’s ‘fishing expedition’ as subpoenas reportedly issued to John Brennan and others

A Maga loyalist US attorney in Miami is expanding an investigation of ex-FBI and intelligence officials who incurred Donald’s Trump’s wrath with an inquiry into how Russia helped him win in 2016, despite the US justice department suffering stinging recent court rejections of indictments of two foes of the US president.

In the months since, whistles have become a popular raid alert tool in other cities across the country – [New Yorkers](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york) wear them around their necks to warn neighbors, the people of [New Orleans](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-orleans) blast them outside ICE facilities and Charlotte residents used them to ward off Customs and Border Protection officials. While strongly associated with Chicago, the tactic is actually one that city organizers learned in part from groups in [Los Angeles](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/los-angeles). Its spread is illustrative of the many ways cities are helping inspire and equip one another in the face of often unlawful federal activities.

Good morning.

Donald Trump is [suing the BBC for $10bn over its editing of a speech](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/15/trump-bbc-lawsuit) he made to supporters before the storming of the US Capitol in 2021.

**On what basis is Trump suing?** He’s seeking $5bn in damages on each of two counts: alleging that the BBC defamed him, and that it violated Florida’s Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act.

**What roadblocks remain to a deal?** The main one is the future of the Ukrainian territories occupied by Russia.

**What’s Donald Trump’s view on this?** He’s appeared to suggest that to receive security guarantees, Ukraine must cede the parts of the eastern Donbas region that it still holds to Russia – something Volodymyr Zelenskyy has previously rejected.

This is a developing story. [Follow the latest in our live blog.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/dec/16/ukraine-peace-talks-russia-europe-us-trump-latest-news-updates)

In all that time, it&#39;s never closed a manufacturing plant in its home country until now. On Tuesday, the last vehicle will roll off the assembly line at the VW plant in Dresden. It comes as the company struggles with the transition to EVs. Plus, the head of Ukraine&#39;s largest energy provider says his company is living in permanent crisis mode as Russia steps up attacks on the country&#39;s energy grid.</source:markdown>

Precisely 85 years ago, one of the most fearsome heavyweight boxers in history stunk out the joint. Joe Louis was in the midst of his “Bum of the Month club”: a staggering run of 13 world title defences in 29 months against an assortment of stiffs, wild men and colourful characters. And when he arrived in Boston on 16 December 1940, most believed that Al McCoy would rapidly become his next victim. Only it didn’t quite turn out that way.

Adopting a crouching, bobbing, weaving style, McCoy was an elusive target for the paralysing fists of the titleholder.” After the messy contest was stopped at the end of the fifth, a storm of jeers rang out.

      <source:markdown>A person who was taken into custody after two people were killed and several more critically injured was later released

Two people have been killed and several more critically injured in a shooting at Brown University, in Providence, Rhode Island. Here’s what we know so far:

**A person in their 20s was taken into custody on Sunday morning, but then released later in the day**. Police chief Col Oscar Perez declined to say whether the person of interest was the same person seen in surveillance footage released by authorities on Saturday. Officials did not name the person. **The person was later released without charge as the authorities said the evidence took the investigation in “a different direction”.**

**A shooter dressed in black [killed at least two people and wounded nine others at Brown University](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/13/brown-university-shooting) during final exams** on the Ivy League campus.

**Brown University president Christina Paxson confirmed that the two people killed were students**. A shelter-in-place in effect for the area was lifted on Sunday morning.

**Eight people with gunshot wounds were taken to Rhode Island hospital**, where seven were in critical but stable condition, Paxson said on Sunday. One person remains in a critical condition, she added. One other student was discharged from hospital on Saturday night and left with their parents, Paxson said.

**Providence’s mayor Brett Smiley said he had visited the victims of the attack in hospital,** praising their resilience and the efforts of emergency medical staff who treated them.

**The two slain have been [identified](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/15/brown-university-shooting-victims) by loved ones as** **Ella Cook** **, a second-year Brown student from Alabama, and** **MukhammadAziz Umurzokov** **, an Uzbek national in his first year of studies at the Ivy League institution.** Cook was vice-president of Brown’s chapter of College Republicans of America, and Umurzokov had dreams of becoming a neurosurgeon, those who knew them have said.

**The university [announced](https://president.brown.edu/president/parents-and-families-campus-operations-after-yesterdays-tragedy) that all remaining classes, exams, papers and projects were cancelled for the rest of the semester.**

**Officials refused to say whether a gun used in the attack had been found.** A small Glock handgun with a laser sight attached and a revolver were found in a hotel room where the person of interest was apprehended, federal law enforcement sources have told CNN.

**Law enforcement agencies were seen at a Hampton Inn hotel in Coventry, Rhode Island, roping off rooms as part of the investigation into the shooting.** An FBI agent said the person of interest had been arrested at the hotel, which is a short drive from Brown University.

**The FBI used cellphone data to locate the person of interest, the agency’s director Kash Patel said.**

**Donald Trump paid tribute to the victims in the attack.** Speaking at the White House, the US president said: “I want to just pay my respects to the people, unfortunately two are no longer with us, Brown University, nine injured and two are looking down on us right now from Heaven.” The president added: “So to the nine injured: get well fast. And to the families of those two that are no longer with us: I pay my deepest regards and respects, from the United States of America. Thank you very much. It’s a very important thing to say, and we mean it.”

**The shooting occurred in the Barus and Holley building, a seven-story complex that houses the School of Engineering and physics department**.

- [Brown University shooting – latest updates](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/dec/15/brown-university-shooting-manhunt-latest-updates)


A person of interest detained after a mass shooting at Brown University that killed two students and injured nine has been released after the investigation took law enforcement authorities in a “different direction”, officials said Sunday night.

The disclosure was made at a hastily convened [late night news conference](https://www.youtube.com/live/p2LyhsA-IAc?si=wZ3SUaSYyINkZ7jb&#38;t=908) to address the killings that have rattled the Ivy League campus. It came more than 12 hours after officials had announced that they had taken a person into custody. The Rhode Island attorney general, Peter Neronha, said authorities had since concluded there is “no basis to consider him a person of interest.”

The release leaves law enforcement without any publicly disclosed suspect, with officials pledging to redouble efforts in the investigation by canvassing for video surveillance that could help pinpoint the killer’s identity.

For decades, libraries served as a safe haven for many queer and marginalized youths in eastern Texas, says former county library director Rhea Young. Unlike the school cafeteria, the library was a space where they could explore and find acceptance in who they wanted to be.

“There were books where they can find characters like them, and realize it’s okay to be who they are,” Young said. “There needs to be more places like that, not fewer.”

Farm worker Owen Salmon has picked apples in upstate New York for almost a decade, some 1,500 miles (2,400km) from home. In the midst of harvest season this year, [Hurricane Melissa](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/28/hurricane-melissa-makes-landfall-in-jamaica), a record-breaking category 5 hurricane, made landfall in Jamaica.

“It was terrifying,” said Salmon, whose wife and two children were at home near Black River, a town on the country’s south-western coast. “For days, I couldn’t hear from them. When I finally did, I heard my roof was completely gone. My wife and kids had to run for their lives, but thank God they’re alive.”

[Universal basic income](https://www.theguardian.com/society/universal-basic-income) (UBI) is back, like a space zombie in a sci-fi movie, resurrected from policy oblivion, hungry for policymakers’ attention: brains!

Andrew Yang, whose “Yang Gang” enthusiasm briefly shook up the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020 promoting a “Freedom Dividend” to save workers from automation – $1,000 a month for every American adult – is again the main carrier of the bug: offering UBI to save the nation when robots eat all our jobs.

Before the street outside her mother’s home filled with gunfire, before panicked partygoers sprinted through the front yard, before she discovered that the body on the ground was a young man she had watched grow up, Khlilia Daniels knew something in Bogalusa had to change.

It was December of 2022, and Daniels had spent the year watching her home town on Louisiana’s border with Mississippi become a steadily more frightening place.

**Are gun laws being discussed?** Yes, the New South Wales premier, Chris Minns, said there would “almost certainly” be changes to gun laws, and police were investigating whether there had been a failure of their systems in relation to how licensed weapons could have been used in a terror attack.

In the immediate aftermath of these devastating events, we recognize that learning and assessment are significantly hindered in the short term and that many students and others will wish to depart campus. Students are free to leave if they are able. Students who remain will have access to on-campus services and support.

At this time, it is essential that we focus our efforts on providing care and support to the members of our community as we grapple with the sorrow, fear and anxiety that is impacting all of us right now. University leaders are committed to providing care and mobilizing resources to assist our community members through this difficult time.

Founded by Jimmy Glenn, a former boxer turned trainer, in 1971, Jimmy’s Corner has stood, defiantly unchanged, as Times Square has boomed around it.

The neighborhood bar, a New York City institution which attracts locals and tourists alike, has had the same pictures on the walls for decades – some of the bar’s regulars have been coming almost as long – kept the same furniture, and maintained remarkably low pricing. In a perhaps unintentional nod to its history, there is also several years’ accumulation of dust in some areas.
