A South Carolina jury has decided the NCAA owes a former college football player and his wife $18m, while finding college sports’ major governing body negligent in failing to warn the player about the long-term effects of concussions.

Following a civil trial that wrapped up late last week, Orangeburg county jurors awarded $10m to 68-year-old Robert Geathers, who played at South Carolina State University from 1977 to 1980 as a defensive end. His wife, Debra, was awarded $8m, according to a court document.

A faltering federal response to one of the worst storms in [Alaska](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/alaska)’s history, which caused hundreds of people to become homeless, is drawing further scrutiny over the [Trump administration](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration)’s efforts to dismantle federal weather and climate protections.

Good morning.

The US and China have [agreed a framework for a trade deal](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/27/us-china-framework-trade-deal-xi-trump-meeting) only days before Donald Trump and the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, are due to meet.

**What about other trade deals that are still up in the air?** There were hopes of a truce between the US and Brazil after what President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva described as a positive meeting with Trump in Malaysia. He said their respective teams would start discussing tariffs and other matters “immediately”.

**And Canada?** Trump said Saturday that he would [raise US tariffs by 10%](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/25/trump-tariffs-canada-ronald-reagan) in retaliation for an [advertisement](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/24/trump-canada-trade-negotations-ontario-tariffs) sponsored by the Ontario government that accurately quoted Ronald Reagan at length saying tariffs don’t work.

**How many people have been killed in the airstrikes?** US forces in recent weeks have carried out at least eight strikes against boats in the Caribbean off Venezuela’s coast, killing about 40 people that the Trump administration has insisted were involved in smuggling drugs.

It all started so well. And then it fell apart.

For two quarters, it looked like Aaron Rodgers might conjure one of those nights, the sort that ends with a smirk, a wink, and a reminder that he can match any of the league’s young pups. It was the first time in his career that he played against Green Bay, where he spent nearly two decades, won four MVPs [and a lone Super Bowl](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/feb/07/super-bowl-green-bay-packers-pittsburgh-steelers). But the NFL rarely cares for nostalgia.

Former player and assistant coach Damon Jones, [who allegedly provided](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/46700252/source-bettors-got-privileged-injury-info-lebron-james) “inside information” about NBA games to bettors, was also taken into custody.
