      <source:markdown>Reports that fire crews were ordered to leave original site of blaze prompt tough questions for city and LAFD leaders

Concerns over a small brush fire that reignited days later into the mammoth Palisades fire – the [most destructive](https://www.wildfirela.org/history/) in Los Angeles history – have grown in recent weeks amid reports that firefighters were ordered to leave the original site of the smaller blaze despite their concerns the ground was still smoldering.

Now, questions remain about how leaders at the Los Angeles fire department responded to a fire that [leveled entire communities](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/09/california-wildfires-pacific-palisades-los-angeles), and who within the agency knew about concerns the fire could still pose a threat. A former LA city councilor says the aftermath and recovery effort should serve as a Pearl Harbor moment for the city, which should never again be in a position with flames encroaching on all sides.

      <source:markdown>Experts say air traffic controllers quickly returning to work, with promise of full back pay, and even $10,000 bonus

Fears that it would take weeks or even months for flight schedules in the US to return to normal in the wake of the US federal government shutdown do not appear to be coming true and the busy upcoming holiday season should be normal for travel, experts say.

That is at least in part because air traffic controllers are quickly returning to work, according to the Department of Transportation.

Gail Etienne still remembers her first day at McDonogh 19 elementary school in New Orleans’ Lower Ninth Ward. As her family pulled up to the school in the car with the federal marshals, they saw crowds of angry people screaming. Some carried garbage cans and sticks.

      <source:markdown>Seemingly identical signatures appeared on clemency orders, which White House blamed on technical error

The Trump administration’s clemency drive is coming under scrutiny after the justice department this week replaced pardons posted online that bore strikingly similar copies of Trump’s signature with others that are distinctively variable.

The corrections came after online commenters seized on the similarities in the president’s signature granting “full and unconditional” pardons to seven men, including to former New York Mets player [Darryl Strawberry](https://apnews.com/television-fc6318ff6f3d4133890956a7576999e6), former Tennessee House speaker Glen Casada and former New York police sergeant Michael McMahon, on 7 November.

The [Trump administration](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration) cannot fine the University of California or summarily cut the school system’s federal funding over claims it allows [antisemitism](https://www.theguardian.com/news/antisemitism) or other forms of discrimination, a federal judge ruled late on Friday in a sharply worded decision.

US district judge Rita Lin in San Francisco issued a preliminary injunction barring the administration from cancelling funding to the university based on alleged discrimination without giving notice to affected faculty and conducting a hearing, among other requirements.

Experts say New York mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani’s selection of Lina Khan, the former Federal Trade Commission (FTC) chair, for his transition team acts as a warning to private equity firms in the state that have raised rents and monopolized local healthcare industries.

Throughout the US, private equity has increasingly monopolized industries through the practice of “roll-ups”, acquiring many small local firms and rolling them into one larger firm, giving them power to simultaneously raise prices and lower quality.

      <source:markdown>Text messages released by US House show convicted sex offender coaching Maga influencer on political messaging. Plus, readers’ favourite photo booth moments 100 years after its invention

Good morning.

The convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein apparently served as [a behind-the-scenes adviser to the former Trump official and Maga influencer Steve Bannon](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/14/jeffrey-epstein-steve-bannon) during an August 2018 media campaign to defend Trump and his agenda, and to promote Bannon’s media ventures.

**What else has been released in the flood of recent Epstein emails?** Among many, many other things, one email shows an exchange between him and an associate in which they discuss “girls” and travel. The justice department continues to downplay the possibility that other men were involved in Epstein’s abuse of teen girls.

**What’s happening with** **rest of the Epstein files?** Trump is facing the prospect of a politically damaging congressional vote to release the files, after attempts to press two members of Congress to withdraw their backing for it appeared to have failed.

**What exactly is climate finance? Who pays it? And who gets it?** Sixteen years ago, at the climate summit in Copenhagen, rich and polluting countries pledged to provide $100bn (£76bn) each year by 2020 [so that poorer countries could cut their emissions and adapt to a hotter world](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/nov/14/what-exactly-is-climate-finance-who-pays-it-and-who-gets-it). Last year, they set a new target of $300bn (£227bn) a year by 2035.

Jeffrey Epstein and his associates worked to suppress negative press and rebuild his image in the years after he [pleaded guilty](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/02/usa.internationalcrime1) in 2008 to state charges in Florida of solicitation of prostitution and of solicitation of prostitution with a minor, newly [released documents](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/13/epstein-files-key-takeaways) reveal.

The documents, among 20,000 pages released on Wednesday by Republican members of the House oversight committee, include emails and memos that depict a coordinated effort to influence online search results and journalists, and restore Epstein’s reputation.

      <source:markdown>Jonathan Jarvis, who led the agency from 2009 to 2017, laid out the dire consequences of not closing parks in shutdown

      <source:markdown>Ben Wright and Rosemary Admiral say UTD severely restricted campus access after arrests at peaceful protest

As the Trump administration and Texas’s governor, Greg Abbott, restrict free speech on college campuses, two professors at the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD) are suing the university for retaliation stemming from 2024 arrests at a peaceful campus protest.

History professors Ben Wright and Rosemary Admiral argue they should not have been arrested in the first place at the 1 May 2024 demonstration, where they were standing between their students and heavily armed law enforcement.

      <source:markdown>Claim, by election deniers, would signal latest step by DoJ in moving away from protecting Americans’ voting rights

Members of Georgia’s election denial movement have claimed in recent weeks that the justice department is investigating debunked fraud claims in the state stemming from the 2020 election.

The development would be just the latest in a series of moves by Trump acolytes at the Department of Justice who are transforming the voting section of the agency from an office focused on protecting Americans’ voting rights to one that is in lockstep with an election denial movement that incessantly demands investigations and drastic reductions in access to the polls based on [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump)’s lies about elections.

      <source:markdown>Head of Nexus Project says ADL’s plan to ‘monitor’ mayor-elect for antisemitism deepens divisions and plays into far-right agenda

The head of an antisemitism watchdog has come out against the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) and other groups for their “divisive, hyperbolic and aggressive response” to Zohran Mamdani’s election, warning that a combative stance towards the New York City mayor-elect is a gift to the far right.

“The instrumentalizers of antisemitism are cheering on the divisions being created in New York City, because that’s their goal: divide people, divide Jews from each other,” said Jonathan Jacoby, the director of the Nexus Project, which works to combat antisemitism and its political abuse.

Democrats appear more enthusiastic than Republicans about voting in next year’s congressional elections following the party’s victories in recent state and local contests, according to a new Reuters/Ipsos poll, which showed Republican President Donald Trump’s approval steady at 40%.

Some 79% of Democrats said they would regret it if they didn’t vote in the election, compared to 68% of Republicans.

[Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump) is facing the prospect of a politically damaging congressional vote on releasing the [Jeffrey Epstein](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein) files after attempts to press two female members of Congress to withdraw their backing for it appeared to have failed.

The reported refusal of Lauren Boebert, a Republican representative from Colorado, and Nancy Mace, from South Carolina, to remove their names from a discharge petition to force a vote leaves Trump exposed on an issue that carries the possibility of turning segments of his Maga base against him.

      <source:markdown>Move escalates legal battle over a redistricting effort designed to help Democrats flip House seats in 2026

The justice department on Thursday [joined a lawsuit](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-governor-gavin-newsom-californias-race-based-redistricting-plan) brought by California Republicans to block the state’s new congressional map, escalating a legal battle over a redistricting effort designed to give Democrats a better chance of retaking the House of Representatives next year.

The lawsuit, filed in federal court in California, challenges the congressional map championed by Gavin Newsom, the state’s Democratic governor, in response to a Republican gerrymander in Texas, sought by Donald Trump. The [justice department’s intervention](https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025-11-13-United-States-complaint-in-intervention.pdf) in the case sets up a high-profile showdown between the Trump administration and Newsom, one of the president’s chief antagonists and a possible 2028 contender.

It may be about to execute him, but Oklahoma’s department of corrections hasn’t even spelled Tremane Wood’s name right: it lists him on its official website as “Termane” Wood.

For 16 of his last 21 years in prison, following his conviction for the murder of 19-year-old Ronnie Wipf, he has been confined, often alone, to a series of windowless concrete cells in the state penitentiary in McAlester, Oklahoma, in an underground block that prisoners have compared to a tomb.

Jonathan Miller, an advocate for the hemp industry and former Kentucky state treasurer, said that “Kentucky is really ground zero for the rebirth of hemp” – a niche industry until the 2018 farm bill allowed a much wider variety of legal products.

It also reported that second-quarter net profit more than doubled to 2.5tn yen (£12.2bn), driven by valuation gains in its OpenAI holdings.

The Israeli embassy in Washington has been circulating a letter on Capitol Hill defending its nine-month detention of a 16-year-old US citizen in military prison as pressure mounts from senators and civil society groups who have called for his release.

The document, obtained by the Guardian, describes Israel’s allegations against Mohammed Ibrahim and the medical treatment he has allegedly received in prison. It does not mention his dramatic weight loss or the fact that his family has had virtually no contact with him since his arrest in February.

As flu season begins in the US, following the deadliest flu outbreak in children outside of a pandemic since record-keeping began in 2004, pediatricians are taking the lead on vaccine messaging.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) does not plan to resume its “wild to mild” flu vaccination campaign, which was halted in the midst of the record-breaking flu season.

Good morning.

Donald Trump has threatened legal action against the BBC and [welcomed the resignations of two of its most senior figures](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/10/trump-bbc-legal-action) after a campaign against the UK’s public broadcaster peaked over the criticism that a 2024 documentary used a misleading edit of a Trump speech on the day of the January 6 insurrection.

**Why did the BBC’s director general and News CEO resign?** They did so after the rightwing Telegraph newspaper published a leaked internal report by a former BBC standards adviser alleging failings in the broadcaster’s coverage.

**What did the documentary show?** Trump’s speech was edited to put together two sentences that were actually 54 minutes apart, splicing him [telling supporters to walk to the US capitol](https://www.theguardian.com/media/video/2025/nov/10/side-by-side-comparison-of-bbc-edited-trump-speech-from-day-of-capitol-attack-with-original-video) and then to “fight like hell”.

**So Trump didn’t tell people to “fight”?** No, he absolutely did, many times. According to the January 6 select committee [report](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Final_Report_of_the_Select_Committee_to_Investigate_the_January_6th_Attack_on_the_United_States_Capitol), “he spent the next 50-or-so minutes amping up his crowd with lies about the election, attacking his own vice-president and Republican members of Congress, and [exhorting the crowd to fight](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/10/why-bbc-resignations-trump-speech-edit)”.

**Why is Trump doing this?** The development “is only the latest chapter in a campaign meant to keep media institutions that cover Trump on their toes,” writes the [Guardian US media correspondent, Jeremy Barr](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/11/trump-bbc-lawsuit-threat-media-attacks).

**What are the spyware companies?** Paragon Solutions, which makes a spyware called Graphite; and NSO Group, which the Biden administration had in 2021 accused of engaging in business “contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the US”. Paragon made a deal the Trump administration in September to provide services to immigration agents.

        <![CDATA[<p>Weston McKennie remains at Juventus due to a manager change, and the US remain vulnerable to outside elements</p><p>When Weston McKennie signed for Juventus in 2020, it had only been 30 days since Andrea Pirlo was made the Italian club’s manager. A few weeks ago, Luciano Spalletti was appointed as Juve’s fifth manager since McKennie joined – or <a href="https://www.transfermarkt.us/juventus-fc/mitarbeiterhistorie/verein/506">his seventh, if you count the interim head coaches</a>. It’s not a new situation for the American. But according to US men’s national team head coach Mauricio Pochettino, it’s why McKennie isn’t with the US during their upcoming friendlies with Paraguay on Saturday and Uruguay on Tuesday.</p><p>Pochettino could have selected McKennie, trusting that Spalletti is the first Juventus manager in years to be instantly convinced of the multifunctional Texan’s value.

      <source:markdown>Weston McKennie remains at Juventus due to a manager change, and the US remain vulnerable to outside elements

When Weston McKennie signed for Juventus in 2020, it had only been 30 days since Andrea Pirlo was made the Italian club’s manager. A few weeks ago, Luciano Spalletti was appointed as Juve’s fifth manager since McKennie joined – or [his seventh, if you count the interim head coaches](https://www.transfermarkt.us/juventus-fc/mitarbeiterhistorie/verein/506). It’s not a new situation for the American. But according to US men’s national team head coach Mauricio Pochettino, it’s why McKennie isn’t with the US during their upcoming friendlies with Paraguay on Saturday and Uruguay on Tuesday.

Pochettino could have selected McKennie, trusting that Spalletti is the first Juventus manager in years to be instantly convinced of the multifunctional Texan’s value. Rather than the usual routine of a manager trying to push McKennie out of the club, only to realize that there’s a reason [only three players in the squad](https://www.transfermarkt.us/juventus-fc/kader/verein/506/saison_id/2025/plus/1) have been at the club longer, Spalletti has given McKennie starts in all three matches he’s overseen. The 27-year-old has played all but five available minutes in that span.

The money sent to Equatorial Guinea is the first taken from a fund apportioned by Congress to address international refugee crises – and sometimes to facilitate the resettlement of refugees in the US – that has instead been repurposed under the Trump administration to hasten their deportation.

Democrats are seething after news emerged on Sunday that eight members of their Senate caucus had collaborated with Republicans on crafting a compromise to end the longest government shutdown in US history, without winning any healthcare concessions that they had sought.

But one name is coming in for more opprobrium than any other: Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader who had led the Democrats’ weeks-long stand against reopening the government without an extension of tax credits that lower premiums for Affordable Care Act (ACA) health plans.

BBC Director General Tim Davie and Deborah Turness, head of BBC News, have resigned over accusations that the broadcaster has been biased in its coverage of US President Donald Trump, the war in Gaza, and transgender issues. The allegations followed a memo published by the Telegraph in which Michael Prescott, a former external adviser on editorial standards at the BBC, raised concerns over &quot;systemic&quot; bias in coverage. Prescott&apos;s primary criticism was aimed at what he says was the selective edit of a January 6, 2021 speech made by Trump to supporters, which aired in a BBC Panorama episode ahead of the 2024 US election. Some pundits have responded to the resignations with claims that the BBC is the target of a right-wing political campaign to dismantle the media organization.

      <source:markdown>Atlético Ottawa secured a Canadian Premier League final victory unlike any other amid a swirling blizzard, with one of their goals dubbed an &#39;icicle kick&#39; from the Mexican midfielder David Rodríguez.

Hosts Ottawa beat Cavalry FC 2-1 in extra-time in Sunday’s title decider in temperatures of -8C (17.6F) with snow so heavy that play was halted every 15 minutes to clear the lines on the pitch and goalkeepers using shovels to mark out their boxes.

After weeks of false starts and failed votes, the [US Senate](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-senate) secured the 60 votes needed late Sunday night [to pass a compromise](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/10/us-government-shutdown-update-senate-funding-bill) continuing resolution that would reopen the federal government after seven Democrats and an independent sided with Republicans to support the measure to send it back to the House for another vote. The Democratic caucus has aimed anger at the defectors, who nonetheless branded their decision as being the best available option.

They were Senators Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, Tim Kaine of Virginia, Dick Durbin of Illinois, Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen of Nevada, John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, and independent Angus King of Maine who caucuses with the Democrats.

The Senate on Sunday made significant progress towards ending the [longest US government shutdown in history](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-federal-government-shutdown-2025), narrowly advancing a compromise bill to reauthorize funding and undo the layoffs of some employees.

But the measure, which resulted from days of talks between a handful of Democratic and Republican senators, leaves out the healthcare subsidies that Democrats had demanded for weeks. Most Democratic senators rejected it, as did many of the party’s lawmakers in the House of Representatives, which will have to vote to approve it before the government can reopen.

Atlético Ottawa secured a Canadian Premier League final victory unlike any other, a snow-globe spectacle amid a swirling blizzard featuring what online media outlets dubbed an “icicle kick” from Mexican midfielder David Rodríguez.

Hosts Ottawa beat Cavalry FC 2-1 in extra-time win in Sunday’s title decider in temperatures of minus 8 degrees Celsius (46.4F) with snow so heavy that play was halted every 15 minutes to clear the lines, and goalkeepers used shovels to carve out their boxes.

It&#39;s progress, but there&#39;s still potential for derailment. Plus, New Mexico is offering free universal child care starting this month. We&#39;ll hear what that means for one family.</source:markdown>

Good morning.

The Senate has made significant progress towards ending the longest US government shutdown in history, [narrowly advancing a compromise bill](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/10/us-government-shutdown-update-senate-funding-bill) to reauthorize funding and undo the layoffs of some employees.

**What did the Democrats say about the bill?** “This healthcare crisis is so severe, so urgent, so devastating for families back home, that I cannot in good faith support this \[resolution\] that fails to address the healthcare crisis,” said Chuck Schumer, the Democratic majority leader.

**What has the IDF said in response?** In a written statement, the IDF said it “remains committed to the rule of law and continues to operate in accordance with its legal and ethical obligations, despite the unprecedented operational complexity posed by Hamas’s systematic embedding within civilian infrastructure and its use of civilian sites for military purposes”.

No league sells parity like the NFL: it’s the entire brand. But through 10 weeks of this season, this isn’t a league that is equally balanced between the good, the bad and the mediocre. It’s one where most of the league is simply _fine._

In the NFC, at least, there is some clarity. The Rams and Seahawks (both 7-2) look like the most complete teams in football, and secured blowout wins on Sunday. The 6-2 Eagles, despite their struggles, still have one of the most talented rosters in the league, likewise with the Packers (5-2-1).

The administrator for the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), Mehmet Oz, recently claimed that an audit revealed “more than $1bn of federal taxpayer dollars were being spent on funding Medicaid for illegal immigrants”, but experts say the audits were unrelated to immigration, and that rhetoric like this could make immigrant families – regardless of legal status – afraid to seek necessary medical care.

Leo Cuello, a research professor at Georgetown University’s Center for Children and Families, noted that he had not “seen what this audit is”, but “based on the reporting, it appears that it is related to administrative errors in state claiming for matching funds, which is a relatively common occurrence, and which CMS monitors closely as they should”.

The growth in global demand for “green” office buildings has slowed after [Donald Trump’s assault on environmental protection policies](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/oct/31/harrison-ford-donald-trump-climate-crisis) caused a slump in interest in the US, according to a survey of construction industry professionals.

The computer interrupted while Pamela was still speaking. I had accompanied her – my dear friend – to a recent doctor’s appointment. She is in her 70s, lives alone while navigating multiple chronic health issues, and has been getting short of breath climbing the front stairs to her apartment. In the exam room, she spoke slowly and self-consciously, the way people often do when they are trying to describe their bodies and anxieties to strangers. Midway through her description of how she had been feeling, the doctor clicked his mouse and a block of text began to bloom across the computer monitor.

The clinic had adopted an artificial-intelligence scribe, and it was transcribing and summarizing the conversation in real time. It was also highlighting keywords, suggesting diagnostic possibilities and providing billing codes. The doctor, apparently satisfied that his computer had captured an adequate description of Pamela’s chief complaint and symptoms, turned away from us and began reviewing the text on the screen as Pamela kept speaking.

While Democratic leaders continue to invest their hopes in a “ [blue wave](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/03/democrats-blue-wave-2026-midterms-00489291)” to overturn Republican majorities in the [House](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/house-of-representatives) and [Senate](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-senate) next year, Trump and some prominent supporters have sought to discredit the possibility that Republicans could lose in a fair fight and are using that premise to justify demands for a drastically different kind of electoral system.

      <source:markdown>Annual migration from frigid Canadian winter to Florida sunshine could become thinner as travellers look elsewhere

The annual migration of hundreds of thousands of Canadian “snowbirds” escaping freezing temperatures in their homeland and heading to warmer US states such as Florida for the duration of the winter could be about to become noticeably thinner.

Many have ditched plans to visit their southern neighbor and are looking to spend their valuable dollars elsewhere, largely put off by Donald Trump’s [escalating economic war](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/25/trump-tariffs-canada-ronald-reagan) with Canada and [strict new immigration rules](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/13/canada-fingerprint-visit-us) that have created fear and confusion.

      <source:markdown>Ron Dailey, 65, survived nearly three weeks in the frosty, mountainous wilderness after taking a wrong turn

The California hunter who [spent](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/05/california-man-survived-wilderness) nearly three weeks stranded in the frosty, mountainous wilderness reportedly survived by rationing out the little food he brought with him – eating 70 or fewer calories daily for a stretch – as well as consuming melted snow to stay hydrated.

Yet before his 1 November rescue, 65-year-old Ron Dailey was so unsure whether anyone would save him that he tried to text his family regrets for possibly missing the rest of their lives – while assuring them that he would watch them “from heaven”.

      <source:markdown>Trump’s team flirts with weakening the dollar, threatening US influence, low borrowing costs and global stability

Magical thinking is indispensable to understanding Team Trump’s economic policymaking. The White House often seems to believe two opposing policies can work together while one policy can do two or three contradictory things.

A heavy dose of hocus pocus will be needed to make the administration’s dollar policy work in the interest of the United States, for it appears that they want to end the US dollar’s supremacy in global finance.

      <source:markdown>New York City mayor-elect refused to ‘be in the shadows’ in the face of Islamophobic attacks during his campaign

Across the country, Donald Trump’s crackdown on immigrants has shaken neighbourhoods, torn apart families and engendered a sense of panic among communities. But in New York, on Tuesday night, Zohran Mamdani, the first Muslim mayor of New York, and an immigrant from Uganda, chose to underline his identity. “New York will remain a city of immigrants: a city built by immigrants, powered by immigrants and, as of tonight, led by an immigrant,” he told an ecstatic crowd at Paramount theater in Brooklyn.

The son of a Muslim father and a Hindu mother, he was born in Kampala, raised in New York, and identifies as a democratic socialist. Almost every aspect of Mamdani’s identity had been an issue of contention during the election. Earlier this week, the Center for Study of Organized Hate published a report highlighting the surge in Islamophobic comments online between July and October, most of which labelled Mamdani as an extremist or terrorist.

I would like to have some words with ESPN broadcaster Chris Fowler about what he said [after Novak Djokovic beat Taylor Fritz](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/03/novak-djokovic-taylor-fritz-us-open-quarter-final-match-report), for the 11th straight time, in the US Open quarter-finals.

Instead, Fowler invoked the continued drought of American men at the majors: none of them had lifted a trophy since Andy Roddick in 2003, and Fritz had been the last one standing in the tournament.

We all love a narrative, myself included. But come _on._ Even if Fritz had beaten Djokovic for the first time, force of nature Carlos Alcaraz was waiting in the next round, who Fritz has yet to beat in an official match.

James Dewey Watson, whose co-discovery of the twisted-ladder structure of DNA in 1953 helped light the long fuse on a revolution in medicine, crimefighting, genealogy and ethics, has died, according to his former research lab. He was 97.

The breakthrough – made when the brash, Chicago-born Watson was just 24 – turned him into a hallowed figure in the world of science for decades. But near the end of his life, he faced condemnation and professional censure for offensive remarks, including saying Black people were less intelligent than white people.

The NCAA revoked the eligibility of six men’s college basketball players for allegations of sports betting on Friday in three separate cases at New Orleans, Mississippi Valley and Arizona State.

The NCAA Committee on Infractions released findings from an investigation that concluded Cedquavious Hunter, Dyquavian Short, Jamond Vincent, Donovan Sanders, Alvin Stredic and Chatton ‘BJ’ Freeman manipulated their performances to lose games, not cover betting lines, ensure certain prop bets were reached or provided information that enabled others to do so during the 2024-25 regular season.

Records on Robinson’s phone indicated that on four separate occasions between November and December 2024, Freeman knowingly provided information to Robinson, who was betting on Freeman through daily fantasy sports accounts.

Freeman also knowingly provided information on at least two occasions to his then-girlfriend, who was also betting on Freeman.

The NCAA said last month that it had been investigating at least 30 current or former players for gambling issues.

      <source:markdown>Glen Casada and his ex-chief of staff were accused of running scheme to win taxpayer-funded mail business from lawmakers

[Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump) has pardoned the former [Tennessee](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/tennessee) state house speaker and a one-time aide of public corruption charges after the White House said the [Biden administration](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/biden-administration)’s justice department “significantly over-prosecuted” both for a minor issue.

Glen Casada, a former Republican state representative, was sentenced in September to three years in prison, and his former chief of staff, Cade Cothren, was also convicted and received a two-and-a-half-year prison sentence. The case centered on their actions after both had been driven from their leadership roles and were accused of running a scheme to win taxpayer-funded mail business from lawmakers.

      <source:markdown>Policy means ‘people will go hungry, food pantries will be overburdened’, says judge. Plus, Tesla shareholders approve $1tn pay package for Musk

Good morning.

A federal judge in Rhode Island [ordered the Trump administration](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/06/ruling-snap-benefits-funding-trump) yesterday to find the money to fully fund food stamps for 42 million low-income Americans in November by today, in a rebuke to the government’s plan to only provide reduced aid during the shutdown.

**What is the impact?** After the administration said on Monday it would [only half](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/03/trump-partially-fund-food-stamps-snap) fund the program, Linda Nageotte, of Feeding America, said: [“One in eight people in our country right now](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/06/snap-cuts-how-to-help) don’t have enough to eat.”

**What’s the shutdown latest?** It’s the longest in history, on to its 38th day. Lawmakers are in talks that could lead to a deal. But some Democratic legislators saw Tuesday’s electoral wins as evidence they should [hold the line](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/06/us-government-shutdown-day-37) to extract significant concessions.

**What** **details do we know** **?** The flight reductions, according to ABC News, will start at 4% on Friday and increase to 10%. Airports in cities including Atlanta, Denver, Dallas, Orlando, Miami, LA, San Francisco, New York, Houston and Chicago will be affected.

**What impact could the move** **have?** The cuts could represent as many as 1,800 flights and upwards of 268,000 seats combined, according to an estimate by the aviation analytics firm Cirium. They are likely to create a cascade of scheduling issues and delays at some of the country’s largest airports.

Stella Barey has an hour for lunch. At 1.30pm, she loads her banged-up Tacoma with her three Belgian malinois and drives to a secret Los Angeles hiking trail. There, she gulps down a tapioca pudding and laces up her sneakers. After checking over her shoulder for foot traffic, she pulls down her brown sweatpants and jiggles her bare ass for the camera. Then come the undies. Her coiffed landing strip hovers above the rocks as a rush of urine floods the trail. Every mile she walks, she films another video: a flash, a moon, a finger up the ass.

When Barey decided in 2020 to pursue porn full-time, she did not imagine that at 28 she would spend more time hunched over a desk – not in the fun way – making flow charts, scheduling Zoom calls, and sending pitch decks. “I’m at my happiest when I’m making a video like putting a strawberry in my butt and pushing it out,” she says. “Now I’m on calls all day and I have tech neck.” Known online as the “Anal Princess”, with large, blinking Shelley Duvall eyes and an American Girl doll pout, she will try anything once – even the title “tech founder”.

It was the week in which Republicans took a beating at the polls, the government shutdown became the longest in history, and [42 million people](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/03/trump-snap-benefits-reactions) across the country, including 3 million in Florida, saw their federal food aid slashed.

But in the alternative reality of Miami, where tickets to an overwhelmingly conservative business conference headlined by Donald Trump cost up to $1,990, and billionaires from Saudi Arabia rubbed shoulders with equally wealthy American tycoons such as Jeff Bezos and Ken Griffin, those events created barely a ripple.

The supreme court on Thursday allowed Donald Trump’s administration to enforce a policy blocking transgender and non-binary people from choosing passport sex markers that align with their gender identity.

The decision by the high court’s conservative majority is Trump’s latest win on the high court’s emergency docket, and it means his administration can enforce the policy while a lawsuit over it plays out. It halts a lower-court order requiring the government to keep letting people choose male, female or X on their passport to line up with their gender identity on new or renewed passports.

It’s now day 37 of the ongoing government shutdown, the longest on record, with both parties continuing to blame the other for the lapse in funding.

For his part, Donald Trump has turned his attention to the filibuster – the procedural mechanism that requires 60 votes in the Senate to end debate on a piece of legislation and bring it to the floor for a vote. He’s hammered home his wishes on Truth Social, and in front of lawmakers at a White House breakfast on Tuesday.

New York, Los Angeles and Chicago airports are among 40 that will see reductions in flights from Friday as a result of the [government shutdown](https://apnews.com/article/government-shutdown-longest-trump-republican-senators-democrats-9712df6c11ef19c5df8f18c8a4f7b341), according to a list distributed to the airlines.

The Associated Press published the list after airline regulators identified “high-volume markets” where air traffic will be reduced on Friday, a move that would force airlines to cancel thousands of flights and create a cascade of scheduling issues and delays at some of the nation’s largest airports.

This article was amended on 6 November 2025. A previous version said the US government was in its 35th day of shutdown. The correct current number is 37 days.

      <source:markdown>Focus shifts to other states where Trump is pushing for redrawn districts as parties race to seize midterm advantage

California voters [overwhelmingly approved](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/04/california-prop-50-voting-result) a redistricting referendum on Tuesday, a critical win for Democrats as they attempt to counter efforts by Donald Trump and allies to redraw congressional districts in their favor ahead of next year’s midterm elections. Now, the focus will shift to other states, where Trump is pressuring Republican-led legislatures to redraw their districts. Democrats are racing to do the same in an [all-out sprint to rejigger](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/nov/02/us-redistrcting-congressional-map) district lines ahead of next year’s midterms.

California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, and fellow Democrats placed the measure on the ballot this summer after Texas Republicans [passed a map](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/aug/01/texas-republicans-congressional-redistricting-trump) that would add anywhere from three to five Republican seats in Congress. The new California map neuters that effort by adding the same number of Democratic seats.

A [new memo](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/28/bill-gates-climate-crisis-pivot) on the climate crisis from Bill Gates relies on “straw man” arguments about the threat to humanity and “false dichotomies” between spending on climate or aid for the poor, some climate scientists say.

I am so happy in America but also thinking one day to come back to the Premier League. It’s the most competitive league.”

Good morning.

There is [still a chance for the world to avoid](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/nov/05/still-a-chance-to-return-to-1-point-5c-climate-goal-researchers-say) the worst ravages of climate breakdown and return to the goal of 1.5C if governments take concerted action on greenhouse gas emissions, according to an assessment.

**How do things stand?** For the past two years, global temperatures have surpassed the [1.5C threshold above preindustrial levels](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jan/10/world-temperature-in-2024-exceeded-15c-for-first-time) set out in the 2015 Paris agreement. A UN Environment Programme report published this week said governments’ current plans would lead to devastating heating of about 2.3-2.5C.

**What has Brazil’s president said** **?** “This \[summit\] is an opportunity for politicians, diplomats, scientists, activists and journalists to witness … the true state of the forests, the planet’s largest river basin, and the millions of people who live in the region,” Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva [wrote for the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/06/brazil-cop-30-truth-world-leaders-climate-crisis-president-lula).

**What is the case about?** Trump has imposed tariffs via the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which in some circumstances grants the president authority to regulate or prohibit international transactions – but only during a national emergency.

**What happens if the court sides against the president?** It would force the White House to reconsider its aggressive tariff policy, which has strained global trade ties.

A federal investigator said a UPS cargo plane’s left wing caught fire and an engine fell off shortly before it crashed and exploded into a huge fireball in Louisville, Kentucky, on Tuesday night, killing at least nine people and injuring 11.

At least 28 National Transportation Safety Board agents arrived at the site and began searching for clues about the possible cause of the disaster, which saw the UPS plane [crash shortly after takeoff](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/04/louisville-plane-crash-airport-kentucky-latest) at the Louisville Muhammad Ali international airport, leaving behind a fiery trail of destruction on the ground and a huge plume of black smoke.

Magistrate judge William Fitzpatrick instructed prosecutors to produce by the end of the day on Thursday grand jury materials as well as other evidence that investigators seized during the investigation. The order followed arguments in which Comey’s attorneys said they were at a disadvantage because they had not been able to review materials that were gathered years ago.

Confirming reports from Uncrowned and Yahoo Sports, White said IC360, UFC’s betting integrity partner, alerted the UFC hours before Dulgarian’s featherweight fight against Yadier del Valle that the underdog was drawing plenty of betting action to win along with first-round prop bets.

      <source:markdown>In today’s newsletter: With more than 50% of the vote, Mamdani tells supporters: “In this moment of political darkness, New York will be the light”

Good morning. A few hours ago, Zohran Mamdani was declared [the winner of the New York City mayoral election](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/04/zohran-mamdani-mayor-new-york-city) with more than 50% of the vote on the biggest turnout since the 1960s. A rank outsider when the race started, he will become the city’s first Muslim mayor and its youngest in more than 100 years. And as an avowed socialist who has emerged as a national symbol of opposition to Donald Trump, he has given progressive Democrats something they believe is worth fighting for.

It was a good night all over for Democrats, who won governorships [in Virginia](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/04/virginia-governor-abigail-spanberger) and [New Jersey](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/04/new-jersey-election-result-mikie-sherrill-wins-governor-race) and saw voters in California support [a redistricting plan](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/04/california-prop-50-voting-result) designed to counter Republican efforts to redraw the map to their advantage in red states. But Republicans believe Mamdani is a gift for them, too: in frequently racist attacks on his candidacy, they have tarred him as a “Jihadist”, a communist and claimed he represents a new extremity on the left.

_**NHS**_ \| An “ugly” racism reminiscent of the 1970s and 1980s has become worryingly commonplace again in modern Britain and NHS staff are bearing the brunt of it, [Wes Streeting has warned](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/nov/04/nhs-staff-face-ugly-racism-akin-to-the-70s-and-80s-says-wes-streeting). Racist abuse now happens so often that it has become “socially acceptable to be racist”, the health secretary said.

_**Productivity**_ \| Employers have been told in a landmark government review that fixing Britain’s health-related worklessness crisis [will require them to spend £6bn a year](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/nov/05/fixing-britains-worklessness-crisis-will-cost-employers-6bn-a-year-report-says). The report said that a drastic expansion in occupational health was needed to help prevent hundreds of thousands of people from falling out of the workforce.

_**US politics**_ \| Dick Cheney, the divisive US vice-president under George W Bush who helped lead the country into a disastrous invasion of Iraq, [has died](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/04/dick-cheney-vice-president-republican-bush-dies) aged 84.

_**UK politics**_ \| Rachel Reeves is considering [slashing funding for more energy-efficient homes](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/nov/04/chancellor-considers-cut-green-levies-reduce-cost-of-energy-bills-rachel-reeves) to pay for a reduction in energy bills, sources have told the Guardian, as the chancellor looks for ways to ease the cost of living in this month’s budget.

Voters in [California](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california) on Tuesday approved a high-stakes redistricting measure, a national triumph for Democrats hoping to stop [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump) and [Republicans](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans) from retaining full control of the federal government in next year’s midterm elections.

Weeks before one of America’s best-known businessmen, [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump), was sworn in as president on an overcast day in Washington DC, a different politician with a similarly familiar name took her oath of office elsewhere in the Capitol.

Liz Cheney was then both a freshman congresswoman from Wyoming and a stalwart of the neoconservative philosophy espoused by her father Dick Cheney, the former vice-president under George W Bush who died on Monday. Trump had repudiated Bush’s invasion of Iraq in his campaign for president, but the congresswoman nonetheless went on to become an ally in bending Republican lawmakers to his will.

- [Dick Cheney, vice-president and giant of Republican politics, dies aged 84](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/04/dick-cheney-vice-president-republican-bush-dies)


Dick Cheney, [who has died aged 84](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/04/dick-cheney-vice-president-republican-bush-dies), came to be seen as a moderate in his later years for his staunch opposition to Donald Trump, but he also stands accused of paving the way for Trumpism by undermining the independence of the intelligence agencies and US adherence to international law.

As George W Bush’s second-in-command in the “war on terror” declared after the 9/11 attacks, Cheney made himself one of the most powerful vice-presidents in US history, and was a key protagonist in the push to invade Iraq, as well as the use of torture on suspected al-Qaida members detained without charge in the CIA’s offshore “black sites”.

The effort is a direct attempt to neutralize [Texas](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/texas)’s partisan gerrymander, undertaken at the request of [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump), to create several new safe Republican districts.

A [Pennsylvania](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pennsylvania) artist’s efforts to create a Halloween float for a local Catholic school went awry when he inadvertently included a replica of the gateway arch from a Nazi concentration camp, prompting a hasty apology from the diocese of Harrisburg.

In apologizing for the fiasco, Galen Shelly [told PennLive](https://www.pennlive.com/news/2025/11/holocaust-imagery-on-halloween-parade-float-designer-apologizes-for-mistake.html) that a lighted archway and lanterns he ordered to decorate a parade float he was building for Hanover’s St Joseph’s school did not arrive in time – so he searched the internet for images of cemetery gates to represent the idea that “none of us get out of this life alive”.

Shelby county’s mayor, Lee Harris, led the lawsuit, along with state representatives Gabby Salinas and GA Hardaway, both Memphis Democrats.

Gavin Newsom, the California governor, is [on the verge](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/02/california-prop-50-democrats-trump) of a political victory that, just a few months ago, didn’t exist.

In August, a group of Texas Democrats fled their state to block Republicans from approving a rare mid-decade gerrymander to redraw congressional districts at Donald Trump’s urging. Altering the maps in the GOP’s favor would make it even harder for Democrats to take back control of Congress in the midterm elections next year.

      <source:markdown>President’s pressure on the department to prosecute his enemies is hurting US law and violating policies, say experts

Donald Trump’s intense pressure on the US Department of Justice (DoJ) to charge key foes with crimes based on dubious evidence and his ongoing investigations of other political enemies is hurting the rule of law in the US and violating departmental policies, which scholars and ex-prosecutors say may help scuttle some charges.

They also voice dismay about charges filed against ex-FBI director [James Comey](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/james-comey) and [Letitia James](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/letitia-james), the New York attorney general, by Lindsey Halligan, the ex-White House lawyer and novice prosecutor, who Trump installed in a key US attorney post after forcing out a veteran prosecutor who deemed the cases weak.

Good morning.

The Trump administration said it would provide only partial relief to recipients of food stamps on Monday, amid mounting uncertainty among the nearly 42 million people on the supplemental nutrition assistance program (Snap).

**How did we get here?** As a result of the shutdown, Donald Trump has threatened to cut off the food benefits for the first time in the program’s more than 60-year history. A federal judge last week prevented the Department of Agriculture from [suspending](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/31/judge-blocks-trump-snap-suspension) Snap altogether.

**What impact will it have?** There have already been long lines at food banks across the nation. Chris Stein [spoke to people](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/03/trump-snap-benefits-reactions) affected, with many saying they would have to scrimp on food to get by. “I’m dumbfounded by the cruelty,” one said.

**Can Trump even do that?** The president does not directly determine how much money any city receives from the federal government; appropriation is the constitutional function of Congress. But control over how money is spent – or withheld in acts of impoundment, which are forbidden under federal law – has become a point of [legal contention](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/03/trump-mamdani-new-york-election-mayor-cuomo).

**What do New York polls say?** A recent survey from [AtlasIntel](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/polls/nyc-mayoral-election-polls-2025.html) showed Mamdani, the Democratic nominee, on 44%, the independent Andrew Cuomo on 39% and the Republican Curtis Sliwa on 16%.

      <source:markdown>Veterans groups say recent Washington Post stories on VA disability payments paint a misleading picture. The paper stands by its reporting

In October, the [Washington Post](https://www.theguardian.com/media/washington-post) reported that it had uncovered “rampant exaggeration and fraud” in the US Department of Veterans Affairs’ disability benefits system.

“Military veterans are swamping the US government with dubious disability claims … exploiting the country’s sacred commitment to compensate those harmed in the line of duty,” the newspaper [reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/interactive/2025/veterans-affairs-disability-claims-fraud/).

      <source:markdown>With polls showing signs of recovery after a popularity slump, Tuesday’s results will test whether the party can regain voters’ trust

One year after [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump) won his way back into the White House, voters are going back to the ballot box in a test of the president’s popularity and whether Democrats are able to rebound from their catastrophic losses of 2024.

With governor’s mansions, mayoral offices, statehouses and mid-cycle redistricting on the line in closely watched contests from Trenton, New Jersey and Richmond, Virginia to New York City and beyond, the party is pinning its hopes on locally rooted campaigns aiming to blunt a national conservative message that has surged in recent years.

Andrew Wiggins was among the first superstar prospects of the social media era. Born in Thornhill, Ontario just north of Toronto, Wiggins was known internationally by the time he was 13. It wasn’t always easy for the shy, small-town kid to embrace the spotlight.

After just one full season at Vaughan, Wiggins needed better competition than Canada could provide and moved on to Huntington Prep in Huntington, West Virginia — a relatively new prep school set in a small, blue-collar, sports-oriented college town near Kansas.

Across the country, Americans who depend on government help to buy groceries are preparing for the worst.

As a result of the ongoing federal government shutdown, Donald Trump has threatened to, for the first time in the program’s more than 60-year history, cut off benefits provided by the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance program (Snap). A federal judge last week prevented the US Department of Agriculture from [suspending Snap altogether](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/31/judge-blocks-trump-snap-suspension), but the Trump administration now says enrollees [will receive only half](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/03/trump-partially-fund-food-stamps-snap) of their usual benefits.

Looking ahead, on Wednesday, **the supreme court will hear arguments on whether Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs on dozens of countries are legal.** It’s set to be one of the most consequential rulings on the expanse of Trump’s presidential power in his second term.

My colleague, **Eduardo Porter**, has this helpful breakdown on the question at the heart of this case. A dozen states have challenged the president’s contention that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) of 1977 gives him the power to impose tariffs on imports from every country in the world to defend the nation from a several “threats” facing the US.

Justices will focus much of their attention on whether IEEPA authorizes the president to [levy a tariff](https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/court-filings/state-of-oregon-et-al-v-donald-j-trump-united-states-department-of-homeland-security-et-al-complaint-2025.pdf) – a word that is not mentioned in the text of the law and is, moreover, a form of taxation, over which, per the constitution, Congress has exclusive power.

IEEPA [gives the president](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1701) authority “to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States, if the president declares a national emergency with respect to such threat”.

Throwing a sandwich at a federal agent turned Sean Charles Dunn into a symbol of resistance against [Donald Trump’s](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump) law-enforcement surge in the nation’s capital. This week, federal prosecutors are trying to persuade a jury of fellow Washington DC residents that Dunn simply broke the law.

That could be a tough sell for the government in a city that has chafed against Trump’s federal takeover, which is entering its third month. A grand jury refused to indict Dunn on a felony assault count before the office of Jeanine Pirro, a US attorney, opted to charge him instead with a misdemeanor.

      <source:markdown>Sam Bankman-Fried, founder and former CEO of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, is serving 25 years in federal prison for fraud. His company collapsed and went bankrupt in 2022. Investigators found that billions of dollars in customer funds had been borrowed without permission to help shore up Bankman-Fried’s other firm, Alameda Research.

But throughout the last three years, Bankman-Fried has maintained his innocence, and he&#39;s filed an appeal. A hearing is scheduled for Nov. 4.

There is an air of calm surrounding Amanda Anisimova when she speaks; a palpable sense of her comfort in her own skin.

In a sport like tennis that can swing its protagonists from one emotional extreme to another, week in, week out, Anisimova has worked hard to value the highs, the lows, and the moments in between, all while staying true to herself.

The first time the Blue Jays won a World Series, in 1992, the team’s victory parade was held on the same day as a contentious national referendum. At play that day was a suite of potential constitutional changes that had Canadians, living through a period of economic strain, regional tension, and a growing distrust of political elites, questioning what kind of country they were living in. The referendum failed and paved the way for another, three years later, in 1995, that almost saw Quebec leave Canada altogether. Following the win, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney congratulated the Jays noting that, beyond it being a “historic victory” the team’s playoff run “united a nation behind you, capturing the imagination of Canadians from coast to coast.” It was something Canada needed.

This time there was no parade. The Jays lost 5-4 to the LA Dodgers in the early hours of Sunday in [a heartbreaking Game 7](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/nov/02/dodgers-win-world-series-game-7-blue-jays-baseball), missing out on their first World Series title in 32 years.

Republicans and Democrats have entered a war in legislatures and courts to narrow the political battlefield of 2026 before a single vote is cast.

Normally, redistricting only occurs after the US census counts residents in each state every 10 years. A demand from Donald Trump to lock in more Republican-leaning districts in Congress, together with a changing legal landscape around partisan gerrymandering, set off a chain of mid-decade reapportionments.

- Smith’s 11th-inning home run breaks deadlock

- LA clinch first repeat championship since 2000


**Dodgers 0-0 Blue Jays, end of first inning**

A bit of confusion here. Ohtani takes the mound a bit late and has yet to throw a warm-up pitch at the time the Blue Jays are ready to bat. The home-play umpire is giving him a little extra time.

George Springer takes three straight balls from Ohtani before taking a strike. The Toronto DH, back from an oblique injury, then rips a line drive to left field for a leadoff single. The crowd explodes.

Nathan Lukes goes down 1-2 in the count and fights off a few more pitches before striking out swinging on a splitter.

Vladimir Guerrero Jr works the count to 3-2, then takes a 100mph fastball right down the middle for a called strikeout ... before catcher Will Smith fires down to second to catch Springer stealing. The strikeout double play abruptly ends the inning. Both teams get leadoff hits in the first inning but neither can take advantage.

Ohtani takes two balls, fouls off a cutter, then singles to right-field off a changeup.

Will Smith grounds out to first base, making the first out but moving Ohtani into scoring position.

Freeman jumps on the first pitch and flies out to center for the second out, but Ohtani tags up and takes third.

Betts takes a ball, then grounds out to short to roars from the Rogers Centre crowd. It’s a scoreless first inning for Scherzer.

It has been a giddy, glorious and occasionally bumpy ride, but this time, it seems, Frankie Dettori’s mind is made up. The most storied jockey of the past 40 years will effectively head into retirement after the main card at the Breeders’ Cup at Del Mar on Saturday, when he will have three chances to add a farewell Grade One winner to nearly 300 on his record already. Racing may not see a career quite like it again.

Alongside Lester Piggott and perhaps John McCririck over the past half-century, “Frankie” registers with pretty much everyone, no surname required. People know who he is, even if they have no interest at all in what he does. In a world that has been fragmented by social media and the internet, Dettori may well be the last racing figure who will ever enjoy such instant name-recognition across a broad swathe of the British population.

A small conservative revolution has swept the humanities at some US colleges and universities.

Often funded by outside donors or earmarks from state governments, the programs tend to bear names featuring words such as “civic”, “freedom” or “classical”.

These centers do credible teaching and research, and are usually not explicitly political. But their goal, to counter what conservatives see as hegemonically leftwing teaching, arguably is.

My beloved friend Pancho is an off-track thoroughbred who has been with me for 24 years. In his youth, in the early 2000s, he soldiered through a vigorous mid-level career on the competitive tracks of Southern California. At nearly 28 now his life is approaching its natural end. Our life together riding trails has been the purest gift. But his slow decline forces me to face the unsettling possibility of euthanasia. It’s a decision that haunts me constantly, like a whispering djinn. Some days are good, some are not. Though I dread the day I may walk into the barn and he lets me know he needs my help to die I am consoled only by the dignity of his life. He’s privileged where many thoroughbreds of his day and thousands since were not. As it was back then, as it is now and will continue to be, for the young racehorse who dies on the track there is no dignity in the end.

As thoughts of Pancho’s creeping decline weighed on me, I took a job at a large equine hospital to fill gaps in my knowledge and learn how best to care for him as health problems arise. But after a while I admitted to myself that the more sincere reason I am there is to observe other horses die. It may sound dark or morbid, but it hardly compares with the deaths I’ve witnessed before: young racehorses with shattered legs or hearts that burst mid-stride, collapsing before an audience in the name of sport.

      <source:markdown>Uncertainty surrounds the signing of this week’s trade deals amid the failure to secure reciprocity from the US to cut tariffs

On Donald Trump’s whirlwind tour of Asia – [which involved stops in Malaysia, Japan and Korea](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/24/trump-asia-tour-key-questions-xi-jinping-china-japan-south-korea-malaysia) – the US president triumphantly collected new trade deals from countries hoping for a reduction in the tariffs he slapped on them earlier this year.

However – China aside – analysts were left asking just how much Asian nations got out of it.

      <source:markdown>Vote passes 51-47 in latest bipartisan effort to end tariffs, after resolutions on repealing Canada and Brazil tariffs passed earlier this week

- [US government shutdown: tell us how it could affect your access to food or health insurance](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/30/us-government-shutdown-snap-health-insurance)


In the days leading up to the Trump-Xi meeting, American officials signalled that the US president did not intend to make good on a recent threat to impose an additional 100% import tax on Chinese goods.

Also that China had shown signs it is willing to relax its export controls on rare earths as well as revive buying soybeans from the US.

The relationship with China is very good.

Because of the tremendous destructive power, I HATED to do it, but had no choice! Russia is second, and China is a distant third, but will be even within 5 years.

Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis. That process will begin immediately.

Aidan O’Brien’s gallop towards an extension of his record for Group One wins in a season has slowed a little in recent weeks, but there was still a shield-beating sense of theatre about the scene as his team for the 2025 Breeders’ Cup meeting at Del Mar this weekend made its way to the track for morning exercise on Wednesday.

Unlike 2024, when City Of Troy was being aimed at the Classic, there is no obvious headliner in the O’Brien lineup, but plenty of the horses trotting past in a well-ordered single file have banked at least one Group One already this season and four are expected to set off as favourite.

More than 40 million Americans will stop receiving food stamps on 1 November, as the US government shutdown enters its fifth week.

The Department of Agriculture says the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap) will be suspended until Congress reopens the government. While the Trump administration argues the department does not have the legal authority to use a $5bn contingency fund to continue the aid, Democrats disagree, and two dozen states [have sued](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/28/food-stamps-lawsuit-states-sue-trump-administration) the government to force the program to continue.

      <source:markdown>Group of 11 Democratic senators has raised concerns about use of Wrap full-body restraints on US deportation flights

A “near-total secrecy” surrounding deportation flights and the use of full-body restraints onboard is raising “serious human rights concerns”, a group of 11 Democratic US senators wrote in a letter on Thursday to top immigration officials.

Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland called upon US Immigration and Customs Enforcement to provide a full accounting of its air operations and to stop using the black and yellow restraints known as the Wrap until the agency explains its policies for the device and resolves other questions about its use on immigration detainees.

      <source:markdown>Guardian analysis finds ICE increasingly keeps people in holding rooms with little oversight, as some facilities see a 600% rise in detention length

[US immigration](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usimmigration) officials have been increasingly detaining people in small, secretive holding facilities for days or even weeks at a time in violation of federal policy, a Guardian investigation has found.

These holding facilities – located at ICE offices, in federal buildings and other locations around the country – are typically used to detain people after they have been arrested but before they are transferred or released. In many cases, they consist of small concrete rooms with no beds and are designed to only be used for a few hours.

ICE has used at least 170 ICE holding facilities nationwide, including at 25 ICE field offices.

The Trump administration and its campaign of mass deportation has led to a near across the board increase in the time people are forced to spend in detention in holding rooms. After Donald Trump’s inauguration, the average time that people spend in detention increased at 127 hold rooms across the country.

Despite ICE’s rule change in June, the agency is continuing to violate its own policy by detaining people at these sites for multiple days at a time.

In some cases, such as a New York City holding facility located on the 10th floor of a federal building in downtown Manhattan, time in detention increased by nearly 600% on average after the June rule change.

In one case the Guardian discovered by looking through agency data, ICE documented that a 62-year-old man was held inside that same New York City holding facility for two and a half months.

The Guardian also found an additional 63 people at the site who were held there for longer than one week, between Trump’s inauguration and late July.

A handful of door-knockers ran into an apartment building to escape the rain, joining Omar Fateh, the mayoral hopeful sometimes dubbed the “Mamdani of Minneapolis”.

      <description>

This all comes as auto loan delinquencies are rising, and the price of new and used cars stays stubbornly high.

      <source:markdown>Bankruptcies appear to be mounting in the subprime auto lending business. This all comes as auto loan delinquencies are rising, and the price of new and used cars stays stubbornly high. Amid all this, the Trump administration is quietly exploring a rollback of federal supervision of subprime auto lenders. Then, could federal law override state law that prevents medical debt from affecting your credit score? Plus, OpenAI goes from non-profit to for-profit.

**_Correction (Oct. 29, 2025):_** _The introduction for the story about Consumer Financial Protection Bureau oversight of auto loan lenders in this episode contained an error that has been corrected. The threshold for which companies the CFPB can investigate involves how many loans those companies originate._</source:markdown>

As of Oct. 1, the U.S. government is limiting Canadian access to the entrance — and the library says it’ll cost around $500,000 to build a new one because the library is built out of granite.</source:markdown>

Researchers in [Pennsylvania](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pennsylvania) have uncovered what they believe are some of the earliest written notes in western musical history – on a ninth-century manuscript they say remained “hidden in plain sight” for years in the hands of a private collector.

The notations – characters and dots similar to shorthand outlines – appear above the word “alleluia” on [the document](https://www.raabcollection.com/medieval-manuscripts/earliest-musical-notations), a vellum manuscript leaf from a Latin sacramentary, a [Catholic](https://www.theguardian.com/world/catholicism) liturgical book used in western [Europe](https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news) during mass from the mid- to late 800s.

      <source:markdown>Emmy award-winner Mario Guevara warns administration ‘has the power’ after he was arrested and sent to El Salvador

Mario Guevara has said he may have been “the first” immigrant journalist whom Donald Trump’s administration [deported](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/03/journalist-mario-guevara-ice-deportation) from the US while working – but the Emmy award-winner added: “I don’t think \[I’ll\] be the only one.”

“Just be careful because \[immigration agents are\] very aggressive,” Guevara recently said from El Salvador in a virtual [interview with the US Press Freedom Tracker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Hqf_ld8woI), during which he was asked whether he had any message for other immigrant colleagues in the industry. “They showed they are – they don’t care about journalists. They don’t believe in the media.”

- Ohtani reaches base postseason-record nine times

- LA lead 2-1 in series ahead of Tuesday’s Game 4


It took Freddie Freeman three chances to get it just right.

When the Los Angeles Dodgers first baseman drove a fastball deep into centerfield in the bottom of the 13th inning, the home fans at Dodger Stadium groaned as the ball nestled into Toronto Blue Jays centerfielder Daulton Varsho’s glove to make Game 3 of the 2025 World Series just the fifth World Series game to ever reach the 14th inning. Two innings later, Freeman hit the ball even harder, but not quite high enough as Varsho chased it down before it could reach the centerfield wall.

Good morning.

The US and China have [agreed a framework for a trade deal](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/27/us-china-framework-trade-deal-xi-trump-meeting) only days before Donald Trump and the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, are due to meet.

**What about other trade deals that are still up in the air?** There were hopes of a truce between the US and Brazil after what President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva described as a positive meeting with Trump in Malaysia. He said their respective teams would start discussing tariffs and other matters “immediately”.

**And Canada?** Trump said Saturday that he would [raise US tariffs by 10%](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/25/trump-tariffs-canada-ronald-reagan) in retaliation for an [advertisement](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/24/trump-canada-trade-negotations-ontario-tariffs) sponsored by the Ontario government that accurately quoted Ronald Reagan at length saying tariffs don’t work.

**How many people have been killed in the airstrikes?** US forces in recent weeks have carried out at least eight strikes against boats in the Caribbean off Venezuela’s coast, killing about 40 people that the Trump administration has insisted were involved in smuggling drugs.
