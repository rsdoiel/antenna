      <source:markdown>On Jan. 7, 2025, the Eaton and Palisades Fires began, killing 31 people and destroying around 13,00 homes in the Los Angeles area. A year later, residents are looking to rebuild the lives and homes they once had.

Marketplace’s David Branccacio and his wife lost their Altadena home to the Eaton fire, and have yet to break ground on a new building. But as they continue to plan for construction in the new year, they are focusing on fire-resistance for the future.

Branccacio joined “Marketplace Tech” host Meghan McCarty Carino to speak about the technology and building that goes into fire-resistant homes.</source:markdown>

Most nights for the last year, Darlene Hamilton slept four hours and woke at about 4.30am. She wanted to sleep, but she could not.

Instead the 66-year-old started the day at her Altadena rental home in morning darkness with a familiar routine, scouring through websites of local humane societies and lost animal groups in search of two familiar little faces. For a year, her days often began and ended with this ritual.

The biggest surprise of [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump)’s first year back in office is how quickly America’s institutions capitulated to “the bully”, said [Michael Steele](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/06/michael-steele-donald-trump-republican-party-interview), a former chair of the Republican National Committee (RNC) turned arch critic.

But with the midterm elections for Congress looming, Steele predicts a resounding Democratic victory amid a hunger among voters to hold the president and his allies accountable for threatening democracy.

A few days before Christmas in Pérez Zeledón, a city in Costa Rica, Greidy Mata stared at two photographs of her late brother.

In the second, he was lying in a hospital bed in a vegetative state, after being deported back home.

Dinner was served, but Mata seemed indifferent. She kept switching between one photograph and the other until she suddenly recounted that a year ago, in what would become the last family reunion, Gamboa announced he would be leaving for New Jersey.

It is a world turned upside down. In his first year in office, [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump) has bullied [Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine), bombed [Iran](https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran) and [toppled the leader of Venezuela](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/03/trump-venezuela-oil-industry). In the eyes of critics, he has turned the US into a rogue superpower that poses a greater threat to [Nato](https://www.theguardian.com/world/nato) allies than its foes.

The blitzkrieg has left diplomats in foreign capitals scrambling to understand Trump’s motivations and what – or who – is shaping his thinking. Like past presidents, he has an inner circle of advisers who are playing a crucial role in determining his worldview.

Pacing inside the Kremlin last weekend, as news feeds churned out minute-by-minute reports of Donald’s Trump’s Venezuelan coup, Vladimir Putin may have been wondering [what it would mean for the price of oil](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/05/russia-weighs-up-fall-of-nicolas-maduro-venezuela).

Crude oil has lubricated the Russian economy for decades – far more than gas exports to Europe – and so the threat of falling oil prices, prompted by US plans for control of Venezuela’s rigs, will have been a source of concern.

A federal judge ruled on Friday that the [Trump administration](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration) cannot block federal money for childcare subsidies and other programs aimed at supporting low-income families with children from flowing to five Democratic-led states for now.

The states of California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota and New York argued that a policy announced on Tuesday to freeze billions of dollars in funds for three grant programs was having an immediate impact on them and creating “operational chaos”.

More than a year after a devastating [wildfire](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california-wildfires) tore through Pacific Palisades, all but obliterating one of the west coast’s most iconic neighborhoods, prosecutors are honing their case against the man they say is responsible.

Jonathan Rinderknecht, a 29-year-old occasional Uber driver who used to live in Pacific Palisades, was charged with three felonies by federal prosecutors in October, who claim he was in the neighborhood in the early hours of New Year’s Day. According to [a federal complaint](https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/10/palisades-fire-criminal-complaint.pdf), Rinderknecht allegedly used an open flame – likely a lighter – to start a small blaze that grew to about 8 acres (3.2 hectares) before firefighters rushed to the area and extinguished it.

State and local leaders say they do not believe that the FBI investigation of the shooting death of Renee Nicole Good will be fair and impartial, and are sounding alarms about the impact of federal officials holding onto evidence in a potential prosecution of the ICE agent who killed her.

Minnesota’s lead investigative agency, the bureau of criminal apprehension, initially began investigating the shooting in conjunction with the FBI. But the BCA issued a statement Thursday morning saying that “the US attorney’s office had reversed course: the investigation would now be led solely by the FBI, and the BCA would no longer have access to the case materials, scene evidence or investigative interviews necessary to complete a thorough and independent investigation”.

More than a thousand protests are planned across the US this Saturday and Sunday after ICE agents shot three people, one fatally, in Minneapolis and Portland, Oregon, this week.

“This weekend, people all over are coming together not just to mourn the lives lost to ICE violence, but to confront a pattern of harm that has torn families apart and terrorized our communities,” said Leah Greenberg, co-executive director of Indivisible, an organizer of “ICE Out for Good Weekend of Action”.

      <source:markdown>Blocking immigration will not make Trump’s America great again – for the US to shine, he must let it get browner

Here’s one reason Donald Trump seems perennially in a bad mood: he has probably figured out that the America [he fantasizes about](https://www.instagram.com/p/DNl0KP8p7j7/) is out of his reach.

However many immigrants he manages to deport or prevent from entering the country, the white paradise he is promising his Maga base, free of Somalis, Mexican “rapists” and generally people from “shithole countries” – closer in hue to the America where he was born – is not his to offer.

At the White House on Friday, Donald Trump endorsed his vice-president’s [baseless claim](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/08/jd-vance-ice-agent-killing-minneapolis-trump) that Renee Good, the 37-year-old [woman killed by an ICE agent](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/minnesota-ice-shooting) in Minneapolis on Wednesday, was part of a shadowy “leftwing network” trying “to incite violence” against federal agents.

Asked by a Fox News correspondent to expand on JD Vance’s comments about Good, the president said that the vice-president “is generally very accurate” and then cited what he referred to as evidence that at least one person in Good’s vicinity when she was killed was “probably a paid agitator”.

- Veteran outfielder spent last season with Phillies


Free agent outfielder Max Kepler has been suspended for 80 games after testing positive for a banned performance-enhancing substance, Major League Baseball announced on Friday, a ruling that sidelines the veteran as he looks for his next club.

The suspension stems from a positive test for epitrenbolone, a metabolite of the prohibited steroid trenbolone prohibited under MLB’s Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment Program. The ban takes effect immediately and would apply if Kepler signs with a team during the 2026 season.

Tesla’s trim name-scheming is starting to get a bit complicated.

The White House said Venezuela would be “turning over” the nearly $3bn (£2.3bn) of crude stranded in tankers and storage facilities before it is sold on the international market and after that the US plans to [control all the country’s oil sales “indefinitely”](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2026/jan/07/oil-prices-fall-after-trump-says-venezuela-will-send-up-to-50m-barrels-to-us).

      <source:markdown>![](https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2026/01/Tesla-Optimus-xAI.png?w=1600)

In a move that completely undermines the “Tesla is an AI company” narrative, Elon Musk’s private startup, xAI, has reportedly told investors that it plans to build the AI to power Tesla’s Optimus robot.

This new development comes from a [Bloomberg report](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-09/musk-s-xai-reports-higher-quarterly-loss-plans-to-power-optimus) detailing xAI’s widening losses and massive cash burn. According to the report, xAI executives explicitly told investors that their goal is to “develop self-sufficient AI to power robots like Tesla’s Optimus.”

This is a massive shift in the narrative and potentially the smoking gun in ongoing shareholder lawsuits regarding Musk’s breach of fiduciary duty.

Then there was the fear and tension over the president’s history of attacking and suing [news organizations over unfavorable coverage](https://firstamendmentwatch.org/tag/trump-suing-for-defamation/). Meanwhile, audience [trust in media](https://news.gallup.com/poll/651977/americans-trust-media-remains-trend-low.aspx) was at an all-time low.

While it was a turbulent time for traditional media, it opened a window for independent journalists like Marisa Kabas, who is not beholden to covering Trump’s every move, nor saddled with decades of institutional distrust. On 27 January, she received a massive scoop she published in her newsletter, [the Handbasket](https://www.thehandbasket.co/p/omb-memo-freeze-federal-grants-scoop): the US office of management and budget was freezing federal grants.

She told NBC News that agents blocked people from approaching Good’s vehicle. Her video shows a man who identified himself as a physician asking to check for a pulse and being rebuffed.

Good morning.

US federal agents [shot two people outside a hospital in Portland](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/08/portland-federal-agents-shooting) a day after an ICE officer fatally shot a woman in Minneapolis.

**What** **do local officials** **say?** Portland’s mayor, Keith Wilson said: “We know what the federal government says happened here. There was a time when we could take them at their word. That time is long past.” He called for ICE to pause operations in Portland until the investigation was complete.

**How are Democrats reacting to the shooting of Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis?** Some are threatening to [use the next funding deadline](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/08/democrats-homeland-security-renee-nicole-good) to forcibly restrain ICE.

**The Guardian has debunked** the false [claims about Good’s killing here.](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/09/white-house-minneapolis-ice-killing)

**What did he say about Venezuela?** When [asked how long](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/09/morality-military-might-and-a-sense-of-mischief-key-takeaways-from-trumps-new-york-times-interview) he would be “running Venezuela”, Trump said for “much longer” than a year.

**What about Greenland?** It “may be a choice” between obtaining Greenland or preserving the Nato alliance, he said.

      <source:markdown>X, formerly Twitter, is facing a global backlash because users are directing the platform&#39;s AI chatbot, Grok, to generate non-consensual intimate imagery. Users have been popping up in the replies of women — and sometimes minors — tagging Grok and asking it to generate images of them in bikinis or undressed.

The company and its owner, Elon Musk, have both clarified illegal content will not be tolerated on the platform.

Plus, President Donald Trump signed an executive order late last year aimed at blocking states from enforcing local AI regulations — something a majority have adopted in some form.

And, Meta is a victim of its own success. Its new Ray-Ban smart glasses are selling too fast to keep up with demand.

Marketplace’s Meghan McCarty Carino spoke with Maria Curi, tech policy reporter at Axios, to discuss all these topics on this week’s Marketplace Tech Bytes: Week in Review.</source:markdown>

The killing of a US citizen by a federal immigration agent in [Minneapolis](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/minneapolis) was a five-alarm fire for the [Trump administration](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration). But a torrent of untruths, half-truths, smears and innuendo has been unleashed by the White House, and amplified by its social media and cable television acolytes, in an attempt to douse the flames.

Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic House minority leader, called the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, a “stone cold liar” on Thursday for her efforts to falsely portray the victim, [Renee Nicole Good](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/08/minnesota-ice-shooting-nicole-macklin-good), a 37-year-old mother of three and award-winning poet, as a “domestic terrorist”.

Democrats sharply condemned the Trump administration over [the killing of Renee Nicole Good](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/08/minneapolis-ice-renee-nicole-good), demanding accountability after the president; JD Vancethe vice-president; and the secretary of homeland security, Kristi Noem repeatedly claimed that the officer acted in “self-defense”.

We are barely a week into 2026, and we are already seeing a significant shift in the narrative regarding Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) timeline. After missing yet another high-profile deadline to achieve unsupervised autonomy by the “end of the year” in 2025, Elon Musk has now dropped a new metric that explains a lot — and raises even more questions.

In a new comment today, Musk has stated that Tesla needs to accumulate roughly **10 billion miles** of data to achieve “safe unsupervised self-driving.”

Those are hospitalizations the insurance giant would otherwise have to pay for.

UnitedHealth did not directly respond to questions from the Guardian about the senators’ assertion that the company had failed to turn over internal documents. But it said in a statement that it will “continue to engage” with the senators and that its nursing home care program “improves outcomes” and “reduces unnecessary hospitalizations”.

      <source:markdown>Experts decry move to leave UNFCCC as ‘embarrassing’ as president orders withdrawal from 66 international groups

Donald Trump has sparked outrage by announcing the US will exit the foundational international agreement to address the climate crisis, cementing the US’s utter isolation from the global effort to confront dangerously escalating temperatures.

In [a presidential memorandum](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2026/01/withdrawing-the-united-states-from-international-organizations-conventions-and-treaties-that-are-contrary-to-the-interests-of-the-united-states/) issued on Wednesday, Trump withdrew from the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), along with 65 other organizations, agencies and commissions, calling them “contrary to the interests of the United States”.

By 1934, it was entirely evident what Benito Mussolini was up to. Italy’s dictator had already consolidated power, colonized Libya and annexed the city of Rijeka. He nevertheless got to stage the second-ever World Cup, [managing it with a heavy hand](https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/apr/01/world-cup-moments-1938-italy-benito-mussolini) and even supplanting the Jules Rimet trophy with a far larger one. Hosting and winning that World Cup didn’t sate his expansionist appetites. By the end of the decade, Mussolini would take Ethiopia, annex Albania and back Francisco Franco in the Spanish civil war.

It was equally well established in 1978 in Argentina that General Jorge Rafaél Videla’s military junta, which had taken over two years earlier, was maintaining its grip on power through [systematic detention, torture and murder](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/17/jorge-rafael-videla). Still, protestations from other nations were ignored and the World Cup kicked off.

_Leander Schaerlaeckens’ book on the United States men’s national soccer team, The Long Game, is out on May 12. You can [preorder it here](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/722130/the-long-game-by-leander-schaerlaeckens/). He teaches at Marist University._

Donald Trump plans to use Venezuela’s vast crude reserves to establish control of most of the western hemisphere’s oil in an attempt to drive the market price down to about $50 (£37) a barrel, according to reports.

The US president has repeatedly raised the prospect of producing enough crude from Venezuela’s oilfields to drive down the US oil price from more than $56 a barrel today to about $50 in an effort to cut energy costs for consumers, according to the Wall Street Journal, which cited senior Trump administration officials.

Edwin Torres DeSantiago received a text message on Wednesday morning as he was tracking immigration enforcement across Minneapolis – a person was shot by ICE at 34th Street and Portland Avenue.

He jumped into his car to head to the scene. Torres DeSantiago manages the Immigrant Defense Network, a group that monitors ICE activity and responds to community needs after someone is taken. He has responded to dozens of scenes in the past few months, and even more in the last few days since the federal government surged its presence in the midwestern city.

CES 2026 in Las Vegas has been dominated by two things: the next generation of AI compute and a sudden explosion of credible humanoid robots.

While Tesla isn’t officially exhibiting on the floor, Elon Musk has been actively monitoring the event from X. His reactions, and lack thereof, to the major announcements give us a fascinating look into how Tesla views the rapidly crowding field of autonomy.

Musk was quick to comment on NVIDIA’s major push into embedded AI for autonomous systems, but he has been noticeably quiet regarding the masterclass put on by Hyundai and Boston Dynamics.

The [Trump administration](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration) has abandoned efforts to combat child exploitation, [human trafficking](https://www.theguardian.com/law/human-trafficking) and cartels as it diverts thousands of law enforcement personnel to [Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ice-us-immigration-and-customs-enforcement), Democratic senators said in a letter to the White House.

Ruben Gallego of Arizona, along with 28 other Democratic senators and one independent, wrote to the president, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Justice (DoJ) on Monday demanding that federal officials provide a “full accounting” of officers who have been redirected to immigration enforcement and a list of all investigations affected by the reassignments.

The deposed Venezuelan president and Flores will almost certainly reside in Metropolitan detention center (MDC) until their federal trial on drugs and weapons charge – inducting them into a notorious group that counts [Sean “Diddy” Combs](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/02/drug-weapon-sweep-brooklyn-jail-sean-diddy-combs), [Ghislaine Maxwell](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jun/16/ghislaine-maxwell-new-york-jail-sewage), [Sam Bankman-Fried](https://www.theguardian.com/business/sam-bankman-fried), and Mexican drug kingpin “ [El Chapo](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/30/el-chapo-guzman-harsh-prison-conditions-new-york)” as either current or previous members.

      <source:markdown>Administration has alleged fraud in decision to halt grants from California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota and New York

Donald [Trump’s administration](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration) said Tuesday that it is withholding funding for programs that support needy families with children in five Democratic-led states over concerns about fraud.

The US Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the program, will require the states to provide extra documentation to access the funds.

The child care and development fund subsidizes day care for low-income households, enabling parents to work or go to school.

Temporary assistance for needy families provides cash assistance and job training so parents in poverty can afford diapers and clothes and earn paychecks.

The social services block grant, a much smaller fund, supports several different social service programs.

Good morning.

Donald Trump and his advisers are looking at “a range of options” in [an effort to acquire Greenland](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/06/trump-greenland-control-us-military), noting in a White House statement on Tuesday that using the US military to do so is “always an option”.

**How are the US’s European allies responding?** In a show of solidarity on Tuesday, the leaders of France, Germany, the UK and other countries issued a joint statement with the prime minister of Denmark, Mette Frederiksen, urging the US to respect its sovereignty. They said Arctic security was a top priority for Nato, a defense alliance that includes the US and Greenland. “Greenland belongs to its people,” the statement said.

**What would a deal of this kind signify?** Top Venezuelan officials have called Maduro’s capture a kidnapping and accused the US of trying to steal the country’s vast oil reserves. However, Tuesday’s agreement is a strong sign that the government is responding to Trump’s demand that it [open up](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2026/jan/06/trump-us-taxpayers-oil-firms-venezuela-investment) to US oil companies or risk more military intervention.

The bombshell announcement that the Trump administration no longer fully recommends [a third of childhood vaccines](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2026/jan/05/trump-rfk-jr-child-vaccine-recommendations) means the US moved from leading globally on vaccination to lagging behind other high-income nations in preventing disease, experts say.

The move is the latest and most significant escalation against vaccines from Robert F Kennedy Jr, a longtime vaccine skeptic and current secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

      <source:markdown>Revelation comes as a first-in-the-nation citizen’s ballot initiative to ban donations by utilities picks up steam

An investigation into Michigan election records has found a major loophole in reporting laws that makes it difficult to track when and how campaign contributions move between lawmakers and the state’s [controversial](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/07/michigan-covid-lockdown-dte-energy) utilities, DTE Energy and Consumers Energy.

State law does not require the date that a contributor makes a donation to match the date that a campaign committee reports receiving it. That has created a scenario in which utilities throughout 2025 have cut checks for lawmakers around the time of controversial votes, but the lawmakers sometimes still have not reported receiving the contribution or report it much later.

The surprise incursion came after months of mounting US pressure on Venezuela, which has included [a blockade](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/16/trump-orders-blockade-oil-tankers-venezuela) of some oil shipments and [airstrikes on vessels](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/01/us-coast-guard-search-survivors-boat-strike-pacific-ocean) off its shores that have killed at least 110 people.

The theory sounds straightforward. Venezuela [has vast oil reserves](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2026/jan/04/venezuela-oil-industry-bust-what-role-could-the-us-play) and used to produce more than three times as much volume as it does now.

That, roughly speaking, is the only clear part of Donald Trump’s plan for what happens next in Venezuela. “We’re going to have our very large US oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure – the oil infrastructure – and start making money for the country,” he said at the weekend.

      <source:markdown>António Guterres concerned by ‘possible intensification of instability’ of Venezuela; ousted president arrives at a Manhattan courthouse where the full list of charges will be read

A UK minister would not be drawn into saying whether his government believes the US capture of Venezuela’s president was influenced by **the country’s rich oil reserves**.

Asked on Sky News why he thought Donald Trump had captured **Nicolás Maduro** and said America would “run” Venezuela, Home Office minister **Mike Tapp** said:

_**This is for Donald Trump to answer**, and I think he has said in his press conference, which I watched with interest around narco-terrorism and that threat._

Discontent at Manchester United these days is only ever deferred. Ruben Amorim’s [departure from the club](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2026/jan/05/ruben-amorim-sacked-by-manchester-united-transfers-power-struggle) on Monday was long anticipated and came, in the end, with a weary sigh.

And so another manager, the seventh since Sir Alex Ferguson left in 2013, falls victim to the United meat-grinder.

Everybody at United, fundamentally, is unhappy. And not unhappy in the sense that Alex Ferguson used to be unhappy, when the club was essentially fuelled by his volcanic rages, but enervated, frustrated by the realisation that this is not how things used to be, that this was once the biggest football club in the country and now they keep failing to get the win they need to lift them to fifth.

Here, butterfly murals abound: one splashes across the side of a hotel, another adorns a school. As for local businesses, there’s the Monarch Pub, the Butterfly Grove Inn, even Monarch Knitting (a local yarn shop). And every fall, the small city hosts a butterfly parade, where local elementary school children dress up in butterfly costumes.

      <source:markdown>Voters will choose secretaries of state in contests that could play key role in outcome of 2028 presidential election

When Americans go to cast ballots in the midterm elections in 2026, much of the attention is likely to be on races for the US House, Senate and governorships – contests that will serve as a referendum on [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump)’s first two years in office and determine the trajectories of the final ones.

But further down the ballot, voters will choose secretaries of state in key races that could have a major effect on how elections are run in many US states, including several battleground states that are key to the 2028 presidential race. Twenty-six states are set to choose secretaries of state next year, including the presidential battlegrounds of Nevada, Arizona and Michigan.

There are losses, and then there are those defeats that show us exactly who a team are. [The Steelers’ 26-24 win over the Ravens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbgNNw0SJ3o) on Sunday night was the latter. It wasn’t just a loss; it was a referendum.

In the final three minutes, four plays swung the win probability by more than 40 percentage points.

The Steelers, missing DK Metcalf and Darnell Washington, scored on four of their five second-half drives, three of them touchdowns, with Aaron Rodgers finding Calvin Austin for a 26-yard score with 55 seconds left. Baltimore, by contrast, couldn’t get out of their own way until Lamar Jackson strapped on his cape, completing seven of his final nine passes, throwing two touchdowns and converting [a ridiculously clutch fourth-down strike](https://x.com/All_22_NFL_Cuts/status/2008026031148683394) to Isaiah Likely with 21 seconds left and the season on the line.

Good morning.

Nicolás Maduro, the deposed Venezuelan president, is [expected to appear in Manhattan federal court on Monday afternoon](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/05/nicolas-maduro-venezuela-new-york-court) on drugs and weapons charges after US special forces seized him in a shocking raid at the weekend.

**What is the reaction in Caracas?** While some [quietly rejoiced at Maduro’s demise](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/04/few-in-caracas-are-celebrating-as-they-face-an-uncertain-post-maduro-future), the traumatic night-time assault on the city prompted stockpiling, uncertainty and fear.

**What’s the global impact of Trump’s slashing of climate science?** It’s substantial. Scientists and forecasters around the world depend on US satellites and studies to track extreme weather in Europe, plan disaster responses in the Caribbean and monitor deforestation in the Amazon.

Maj Gen Paul Eaton has sounded the alarm, saying in an interview with the Guardian that the effort to bend the higher echelons of the military to the US president’s will was unparalleled in recent history and could have long-term dire consequences.

Venezuela’s beleaguered oil industry could “make a lot of money” with the might of the US behind it, Trump told the press, claiming that the new regime would invest billions to revive its fortunes.

      <source:markdown>Donald Trump says US will ‘run’ Venezuela as Nicolás Maduro and wife Cilia Flores are flown to New York

The US president, Donald Trump, has said the US will ‘run’ Venezuela after its president, Nicolás Maduro, and his wife, Cilia Flores, were captured and taken to New York, hours after a “large-scale” pre-dawn assault on Caracas and the surrounding region. Here is what we know so far:

Donald Trump said **“We’re going to run the country**\[Venezuela\] until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition” during a press conference about the attack on Venezuela. He has not given details.

**A plane carrying Maduro and Flores landed in New York on Saturday evening** and they were expected to be transported to appear in Manhattan federal court, possibly as soon as Monday.

**The** **US is going to be “very strongly involved” in Venezuela’s oil industry after the military operation** **, Trump** **said.** He said: “We have the greatest oil companies in the world, the biggest, the greatest, and we’re going to be very much involved in it.”

**Trump posted a photograph of Maduro on his Truth Social platform.** It appeared to show the captured Venezuelan president in handcuffs, wrap-around sun goggles and headphones.

**The** **UN security council** is [due to hold](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2026/jan/03/caracas-explosions-venezuela-maduro-latest-news-updates-live?page=with%3Ablock-69597e098f083c44d70df0a0#block-69597e098f083c44d70df0a0) an emergency meeting on Monday.

Trump said his administration **had not spoken to Venezuela’s exiled opposition leader** **María Corina Machado**. He said he did not think she would be able to return to lead Venezuela, saying: “She does not have the support in Venezuela. She is a very nice woman but she does not have the support.”

The constitutional chamber of Venezuela’s supreme court has ordered **vice president Delcy Rodríguez** to assume the role of acting president in Maduro’s absence.

**Trump was asked about Cuba** during the press conference on Venezuela. He said “Cuba, as you know, is not doing very well right now. That system has not been a very good one for Cuba. The people there have suffered for many, many years and I think Cuba is going to be something we’ll end up talking about, because Cuba is a failing nation right now.”

The **US Department of Justice released a new indictment** against Nicolás Maduro, including his wife, Celia Flores, his son and others.

**The US vice-president, JD Vance, hailed what he called a “truly impressive operation”** **.** Resharing Trump’s post about the action, Vance [wrote](https://x.com/JDVance/status/2007447083909841398): “The president offered multiple off-ramps, but was very clear throughout this process: the drug trafficking must stop, and the stolen oil must be returned to the United States.”

**In a statement on X, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said Maduro** **was “under indictment for pushing drugs in the United States”.** The Republican senator Mike Lee said on Saturday that Rubio had told him he “anticipates no further action in Venezuela now that Maduro is in US custody”.

The **UN secretary general, António Guterres, is deeply alarmed by US military action in Venezuela**, his spokesperson has said, and considered the US intervention “a dangerous precedent”.

The US bombardment of Venezuela and the capture of its president, Nicolás Maduro, follow a long history of interventions in South and Central America and the Caribbean over the past two centuries. But they also mark an unprecedented moment as the first direct US military attack on a South American country.

At a press conference after Maduro’s capture, Donald Trump said that “American dominance in the western hemisphere will never be questioned again”.

      <source:markdown>- Stolz trips early but finishes third in 1,000m

- World record-holder still locks in Olympic spot

- Jackson tops Brittany Bowe in women’s 1,000m


Star speed skater Jordan Stolz shockingly stumbled to the ice right after the start of the men’s 1,000 meters at the US Olympic trials for long track speed skating on Saturday but still finished with the third-fastest time and will head to the Milan Cortina Winter Games.

Stolz caught the toe of one of his skates on the slick surface, lost his footing and tripped after fewer than five strides at the Pettit National Ice Center, about 40 miles south of his hometown of Kewaskum. It was the sort of thing that simply doesn’t happen to the best in the world at what he does – someone expected to earn multiple medals and to be one of the faces of the 6-22 February Olympics.

      <source:markdown>New documents reveal numerous missed opportunities as experts and victims condemn US authorities’ failures

Over the course of two decades, [Jeffrey Epstein](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein) repeatedly appeared on law enforcement’s radar for sexual misconduct involving teen girls and young women. And over this same period of time, Epstein avoided serious and meaningful punishment for his crimes.

The US justice department’s recent disclosure of long-secret investigative files related to Epstein has once again raised the question of why he wasn’t interdicted sooner, despite numerous reports of misconduct.

Zohran Mamdani vowed to “reinvent” New York City in a speech on his first day as mayor, promising “a new era” for America’s largest city and an ambitious start to his term of office.

The 34-year-old political star and democratic socialist, who a year ago was a virtually unknown state assemblyman, is the city’s first Muslim mayor, the first of south Asian descent and the first to be born in Africa. He is also the first to be sworn in using the Qur’an.

      <source:markdown>Blaze that swept through crowded New Year’s Eve bar in Crans-Montana also injured 115 people. Plus, the politicians and advocates making climate policy part of the affordability agenda

Good morning.

Swiss investigators are [racing to identify the victims of a fire](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/01/switzerland-to-hold-five-days-of-mourning-after-dozens-killed-in-resort-fire) that tore through a crowded bar, killing about 40 people and injuring 115 who were celebrating at a New Year’s Eve party in the Alpine ski resort of Crans-Montana.

**How did the fire start?** The fire broke out at 1.30am on Thursday in the town’s Le Constellation bar, but it’s not yet clear what set off the blaze. Some witnesses said it started after sparklers or flares were put into champagne bottles.

**How long will it take to identify the dead?** Swiss police have warned it could take days or even weeks, leaving an agonising wait for family and friends.

**What else did he say?** Mamdani did not shy away from his socialist politics. “I was elected as a democratic socialist and I will govern as a democratic socialist. I will not abandon my principles for fear of being called radical,” he said to loud cheers from the gathered crowd. He ended by saying: “The work has only just begun.”

      <source:markdown>The surprise hit series has reopened a familiar debate: why, in the National Hockey League, visibility is still treated as a problem rather than a possibility

At around the midpoint of the first episode of Heated Rivalry, just after Shane Hollander and Ilya Rozanov – one Canadian, the other Russian, both hockey’s top prospects – have had their first tryst, Hollander sits at the side of his hotel bed and says: “So. You’re not going to tell anyone about this, are you?” Rozanov, lying naked beside him, replies sarcastically: “Me? Yes, Hollander, I’m going to tell everyone.” Hollander reinforces the point: “Because no one can know,” he says. Rozanov utters something under his breath in Russian, then: “Hollander. Look, I’m not going to tell anyone, OK?” Hollander replies: “OK.”

      <source:markdown>- Miami reaches CFP final four after Cotton Bowl shock

- Scott’s pick-six turns game against Buckeyes

- Hurricanes one win from title game at home


Keionte Scott peeked over at the Miami sideline to see the reaction of his teammates as he sprinted 72 yards untouched for a touchdown returning an interception against defending national champion Ohio State.

They certainly were excited, as were a Pro Football Hall of Fame receiver and a former coach who won national championships with the Hurricanes.

The $2bn (£1.5bn) of aid the [US pledged this week](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/29/us-pledge-un-model-humanitarian-assistance) may have been hailed as [“bold and ambitious”](https://reliefweb.int/report/world/ocha-managed-humanitarian-funds-receive-landmark-us2-billion-contribution-united-states) by the UN but could be the “nail in the coffin” in changing to a shrunken, less flexible aid system dominated by Washington’s political priorities, aid experts fear.

After a year of [deep cuts in aid budgets](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/dec/21/sweden-and-germany-slash-aid-budgets-to-focus-on-ukraine-and-defence-spending) by the US and European countries, the announcement of new money for the humanitarian system is a source of some relief, but experts are deeply concerned about demands that the US has imposed on how the money should be managed and where it can go.

      <source:markdown>As the Trump administration derides climate policy as a ‘scam’, emissions-cutting measures are gaining popularity

A group of progressive politicians and advocates are reframing emissions-cutting measures as a form of economic populism as the [Trump administration](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration) derides climate policy as a “scam” and fails to deliver on promises to tame energy costs and inflation.

Climate politics were once cast as a test of moral resolve, calling on Americans to accept higher costs to avert environmental catastrophe, but that ignores how rising temperatures themselves drive up costs for working people, said Stevie O’Hanlon, co-founder of the youth-led Sunrise Movement.

      <source:markdown>Democratic socialist mayor led historic push to lead New York, speaking on immigration, Trump and subway burritos

[Zohran Mamdani](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/zohran-mamdani), the democratic socialist who is now mayor of [New York City](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york), ran a campaign known for its soaring political rhetoric, its [viral memes](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/20/zohran-mamdani-social-media-viral-videos) and its candidate’s witty quips.

Here are some of the quotes that came to define his [historic](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/06/zohran-mamdani-campaign-new-york-democrats) [push](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/23/zohran-mamdani-new-york-city-mayor-race-viral) to lead one of the world’s most important cities:

New York will remain a city of immigrants: a city built by immigrants, powered by immigrants, and, as of tonight, led by an immigrant. So hear me, President Trump, when I say this: to get to any of us, you will have to get through all of us.

What I don’t have in experience, I make up for in integrity. And what you don’t have in integrity, you could never make up for with experience.

No more will New York be a city where you can traffic in Islamophobia and win an election.

It’s pronounced ‘cyclist’.

I am young, despite my best efforts to grow older. I am Muslim. I am a democratic socialist. And most damning of all, I refuse to apologize for any of this.

I don’t think that we should have billionaires because, frankly, it is so much money in a moment of such inequality, and ultimately, what we need more of is equality across our city and across our state and across our country.

I hear you. I see you. And if you’re a burrito on the Q train, I eat you.

If anyone can show a nation betrayed by Donald Trump how to defeat him, it is the city that gave rise to him. So, if there is any way to terrify a despot, it is by dismantling the very conditions that allowed him to accumulate power. This is not only how we stop Trump, it’s how we stop the next one. So, Donald Trump, since I know you’re watching, I have four words for you: turn the volume up!

Zohran Mamdani was sworn into office as New York’s 111th mayor at the stroke of midnight, the first Muslim mayor as well as the first to take office as a Democrat bearing the credentials of a democratic socialist.

The 34-year-old was sworn in by Letitia James, the state attorney general, in a disused subway station beneath city hall that acts as turnaround for the local 5 train, to be followed by a first-of-its-kind public block party along Broadway’s “Canyon of Heroes”.

Donald Trump’s new [national security strategy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-National-Security-Strategy.pdf) offers a misguided assessment of Europe, long regarded as the US’s most reliable ally. Unrestrained immigration and other policies derided by administration officials as “woke”, it warns, could lead to “civilisational erasure” within a few decades.

That argument rests on a fundamental misreading of Europe’s current predicament. While the EU does face an existential threat, it has little to do with immigration or cultural politics. In fact, the share of foreign-born residents in the [US](https://usafacts.org/answers/how-many-immigrants-are-in-the-us/country/united-states/) is slightly higher than [in Europe](https://www.rfberlin.com/immigrant-population-eu/).

      <source:markdown>In Eating Behind Bars, author Leslie Soble details how food is used to further punish incarcerated people in the US

At best you get “ [mystery meat](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/15/irish-tourist-ice-detention)”. Or “sour-smelling heaps” of [macaroni](https://www.postandcourier.com/food/feeding-the-prison-system-some-inmates-buy-way-around-institutional-cooking/article_34755b6a-ab43-11e6-9077-5b2ef518ef63.html). In the worst cases, it’s [undercooked](https://www.businessinsider.com/san-quentin-on-lockdown-as-inmates-suffer-gastrointestinal-illness-2024-7) chicken, [spoiled milk](https://nbcmontana.com/news/local/report-montana-state-prison-inmates-served-spoiled-milk) and maggot-infested [produce](https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2015/06/02/aramark-michigan-prison-contractor-maggots-kitchen/28378435/).

It cut federal EV tax credits — up to $7,500 for new cars and $4,000 for used ones. Those incentives had been on the books in some form since 2008 and were expanded during the Biden administration. They expired at the end of September.

Consumers rushed to take advantage before they disappeared, leading to [record high sales](https://www.coxautoinc.com/insights-hub/q3-2025-ev-sales-report-commentary/) earlier this year. But now the market faces an uncertain road ahead.

A series of December storms delivered a welcome boost to [California](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california)’s snowpack, scientists said on Tuesday in a closely watched assessment of the state’s [water](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/water) resources for the year ahead.

      <source:markdown>Aspirant Americans tell of exclusions from ceremonies by sudden policy introduced on ‘security’ grounds

The occasion should have been marked by the joy of reaching the destination of US citizenship following the long odyssey of immigration.

Instead, the ceremony at Boston’s Faneuil Hall – renowned as a “cradle of liberty” for its role as a protest hub in the run-up to the American revolution – felt like a nightmarish end of the road for some aspirant new Americans who had turned up full of hope.

Retired brigadier general Shawn Harris had been all geared up for a campaign to defeat Marjorie Taylor Greene next November, and then the far-right representative quit the field. Now he’s wondering what Republicans will throw at him.

In November, Greene announced she would resign from Congress rather than face a challenger backed by the president after she began disagreeing with Donald Trump’s policies on Iran, healthcare and the release of the Epstein files, opening the field for a successor.

In a major study [released recently in Epidemiology](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/08/health/school-closures-mental-health.html), conclusions were drawn – yet again – regarding how shutdowns and online learning were ultimately very damaging to kids’ emotional and mental health (obviously some cohorts of kids were more affected than others with financial security a big part of the calculation). This is no major surprise as parents and students alike weren’t happy with the remote learning environment.

Yet despite this general consensus about online schooling not being as healthy as regular school, a new trend has exploded since Covid: the rapid growth of online schooling for tennis players and other athletes. Parents and their junior athletes feel that by being able to play several hours in the day instead of after school it will accelerate their progress in the sport while still leaving room for academics. And from my perspective, as a parent of a competitive tennis player who attends a “regular” school, it appears to be the rule, not the exception, that most advanced junior players are in online school and not in a physical building.

      <source:markdown>As the billionaire retires, he leaves memorable advice from his annual letters that include pithy takes on bubbles, discipline and long-term goals

Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor [who is retiring at the end of 2025](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/03/warren-buffett-retirement-berkshire-hathaway), has entertained and educated shareholders in his Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate for many years with his pithy annual letters outlining the firm’s performance.

Every year since 1965 he has updated his investors on the journey as Berkshire morphed from a “struggling northern textile business” with $25m of shareholder equity when he took over, to an empire worth more than $1tn.

Though the price I paid for Berkshire looked cheap, its business – a large northern textile operation – was headed for extinction.

My error caused Berkshire shareholders to give far more than they received (a practice that – despite the biblical endorsement – is far from blessed when you are buying businesses).

Woody Allen once explained why eclecticism works: ‘The real advantage of being bisexual is that it doubles your chances for a date on Saturday night.’

When such a CEO is encouraged by his advisers to make deals, he responds much as would a teenage boy who is encouraged by his father to have a normal sex life. It’s not a push he needs.

Andrew destroyed a few small insurers. Beyond that, it awakened some larger companies to the fact that their reinsurance protection against catastrophes was far from adequate. (It’s only when the tide goes out that you learn who’s been swimming naked.)

In our view, however, derivatives are financial weapons of mass destruction, carrying dangers that, while now latent, are potentially lethal.

Participants seeking to dodge troubles face the same problem as someone seeking to avoid venereal disease: it’s not just whom you sleep with, but also whom they are sleeping with.

From this irritating reality comes the first law of corporate survival for ambitious CEOs who pile on leverage and run large and unfathomable derivatives books: modest incompetence simply won’t do; it’s mind-boggling screw-ups that are required.

When downpours of that sort occur, it’s imperative that we rush outdoors carrying washtubs, not teaspoons. And that we will do.

Naturally, I was delighted to attend Mrs B’s birthday party. After all, she’s promised to attend _my_ 100th.

She sold me our interest when she was 89 and worked until she was 103. (After retiring, she died the next year, a sequence I point out to any other Berkshire manager who even thinks of retiring.)

The candidates are young to middle-aged, well-to-do to rich, and all wish to work for Berkshire for reasons that go beyond compensation.

(I’ve reluctantly discarded the notion of my continuing to manage the portfolio after my death – abandoning my hope to give new meaning to the term ‘thinking outside the box’.)

**Benjamin Netanyahu** is expected to tell **Donald Trump** on Monday that **Hamas must return the remains of the last Israeli hostage left in Gaza before the next stages of the stalled ceasefire can be implemented**, Israeli officials and analysts say.

The trip comes amid a **new push by officials in Washington to force concessions from Israel** to allow progress towards a second stage of the ceasefire in [Gaza](https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza), which began in October after two years of devastating war.

He feels he has a number of cards to play yet and the remains of Gvili is the easiest one to play now but there are others.

Netanyahu knows exactly what he wants for Christmas – more of the same. Israeli troops stay in 51% of Gaza, periodically striking Hamas … without the shadow of withdrawal looming over him. None of this requires a denunciation of the \[Trump\] plan itself and Trump can very easily justify Israel’s extended stay on Hamas’s unwillingness to disarm.

Two men who died after their helicopters collided midair in New Jersey over the weekend both earned their private pilot licenses over a decade ago and would often have breakfast together at a cafe near the crash site before taking to the skies from the local airport.

Authorities on Monday identified the two New Jersey men as Kenneth Kirsch, 65, and Michael Greenberg, 71. Witnesses told police that the two helicopters they were piloting Sunday were flying close together just before they crashed in a farm field near the airport in Hammonton, about 35 miles (56km) south-east of Philadelphia.

      <source:markdown>Gaza not covered in announcement and will be handled on separate track, says US state department official

The United States on Monday pledged $2bn in assistance to tens of millions of people facing hunger and disease in more than a dozen countries next year, part of what it said was a new mechanism for the delivery of life-saving assistance following major foreign aid cuts by the Trump administration.

The US slashed its aid spending this year, and leading western donors such as Germany also pared back assistance as they pivoted to increased defense spending, triggering a severe funding crunch for the UN. The billions of dollars in assistance pledged by Washington on Monday will be overseen by the UN office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs, the state department said, under what it described as new model of assistance agreed with the UN that aims to make aid funding and delivery more efficient and increase accountability for the spending of funds.

We talk a lot here at _Electrek_ about the exponential growth of electric vehicles and the massive strain that puts on the battery supply chain. Literally, the majority of that demand and production comes from China.

But there is a massive difference between _processing_ materials and actually having them in the ground.

A new image from a gigantic materials mining and recycling company in China, gives us a sobering look at the reality of their domestic reserves. The data suggests that China’s own supply of the most critical battery metals isn’t just running low; in some cases, it’s already gone.

In the past decade at the forefront of US politics, Donald Trump has unleashed a barrage of unusual, misleading or dubious assertions about the climate crisis, which he most famously called a “hoax”.

This year has seen Trump ratchet up his often questionable claims about the environment and how to deal, if at all, with the threats to it. In a year littered with lies and wild declarations, these are the five that stood out as the most startling.

      <source:markdown>Exclusive poll: Americans are also increasingly blaming the White House for their financial woes

Twice as many Americans believe their financial security is getting worse than better, according to an exclusive new poll conducted for the Guardian, and they are increasingly blaming the White House.

The poll, conducted by Harris, will be a further blow to Donald Trump’s efforts to fight off criticism of his handling of the economy and contains some worrying findings for the president.

Nearly half (45%) of Americans said their financial security is getting worse compared to 20% who said it’s getting better.

57% of Americans said the US economy is undergoing a recession, up 11% from a similar poll that was conducted in February.

Inglewood, California – a few miles east of Los Angeles international airport – is known as the city of champions. The NBA champion Lakers once called Inglewood’s Forum – famously dubbed “the fabulous Forum” by announcer Chick Hearn – home.

By the mid-2000s, with the Lakers gone and another local landmark – nearby Hollywood Park racetrack – closed, the city was close to bankruptcy. Then came a series of deals – often attributed to the leadership of the mayor James Butts – that reinvigorated the city, as a new epicenter of sports and entertainment such as the new spaceship-like SoFi Stadium and the Intuit Dome. When the 2028 Olympics roll around, Inglewood is slated to host many of the events as the world watches.

A man in [Oklahoma](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/oklahoma) is facing a manslaughter charge after he allegedly shot a woman several blocks from his home while firing a gun he got himself for Christmas at an energy drink can in his back yard.

As told in court documents reviewed by [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/oklahoma-man-fatally-shooting-woman-target-practicing-backyard-rcna251138), the death of Sandra Phelps at the hands of Cody Wayne Adams illustrates how deadly the consequences can be when those engaging in the US’s prevalent gun culture do so unsafely.

But their devastating losses in the 2024 election threw the party’s problems into stark relief, prompting a wave of competing explanations from inflation and the border to Gaza, Joe Biden’s age, Kamala Harris’s clipped campaign, “woke” policies, an anti-incumbent mood or, more likely, some combination of them all.

One diagnosis, however, drew striking consensus: Democrats had allowed themselves to be drowned out online by the right’s vast – and well-funded – digital army.

      <source:markdown>Rule allows minority party to block legislation, but GOP is reluctant to scrap it as they could lose majority

[Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump) has floated the idea of ending the filibuster – a procedural technique in [Congress](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-congress) that allows a minority of senators to block legislation from passing – which would make pushing through his political agenda in 2026 much easier.

In an interview with [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/27/trump-to-politico-midterm-elections-will-be-about-pricing-00706877), the president urged [Republicans](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans) in the [Senate](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-senate) to scrap the filibuster, saying it had become an obstacle to effective governing and removing it would prevent another government shutdown and pave the way for his party to push through its legislative priorities.

Suze Lopez, a 41-year-old emergency room nurse in Bakersfield, California, delivered baby Ryu via surgery in August, so the newborn is celebrating his first Christmas. He had been an ectopic pregnancy – when a fertilized egg implants and grows outside the uterus – and was hidden behind a large ovarian cyst.

“Your decision to withdraw at the last moment – explicitly in response to the Center’s recent renaming, which honors President Trump’s extraordinary efforts to save this national treasure – is classic intolerance and very costly to a non-profit Arts institution,” the venue’s president, Richard Grenell, wrote in a letter to musician Chuck Redd that was shared with the Associated Press.

It’s been a year for the history books in the House of Representatives.

It’s official. The word “sustainable” is gone from Tesla’s mission statement.

For over a decade, Tesla’s guiding star was arguably the most impactful corporate mission statement of the 21st century. But over the last few years, we have watched the company slowly drift away from its environmental roots.

Now, Elon Musk has confirmed the final step in that divorce, rebranding the company’s goal from “Sustainable Abundance” to simply “Amazing Abundance.”

In early October, Tracy Wright invited a group of other women in her social circle – all fellow knitters – to gather outside the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in their home town of Portland, Oregon. They were “armed with their weapons of mass construction”.

Donald Trump had just ordered national guard troops deployed to the city, which he called “war ravaged” in order to protect ICE facilities he said were “under siege” by anti-fascists “and other domestic terrorists”.

Hegseth [wrote on X](https://x.com/PeteHegseth/status/2004332431542022289?s=20): “The president was clear last month: the killing of innocent Christians in Nigeria (and elsewhere) must end.

But since resuming the US presidency in January, Trump, the former host of the reality TV show [The Apprentice](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/10/trump-the-apprentice-president-elect-reality-tv), appears to have become an uncharacteristically bashful boss, more disposed to hiring than firing.

      <source:markdown>Texas governor among those to call for expanded access to ibogaine, said to help with treating veterans with PTSD

For half a century, psychedelics largely belonged to the cultural left: anti-war, anti-capitalist, suspicious of the church and state. Now, one of the most politically consequential psychedelic drugs in the US – ibogaine – is being championed by evangelical Christians, Republican governors, military veterans, and big tech billionaires.

Many of them see ibogaine, an intense psychedelic derived from a central African rootbark, as a divine technology. In fact, some pointedly do not refer to it as a psychedelic, given the apparent baggage of the term in some circles.

In 2023 the US marine veteran consulted on a documentary that war-gamed a presidential candidate staging a military coup.

Any Lucia López Belloza will not be home for Christmas. The 19-year-old freshman was on a business scholarship at Babson College near Boston, when she decided to take a surprise flight home to Austin, Texas, to spend Thanksgiving with her parents and sisters.

Just before she boarded her flight at Logan airport on 20 November, she was [arrested by federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/08/ice-family-college-student-deported-honduras) and within 48 hours was deported back to Honduras, a country she left aged seven seeking asylum, with chains on her waist, ankles and wrists.

Republicans are attempting to exempt some major polluters from paying for Pfas “forever chemical” cleanup. If successful, it could mark a major setback in US effort to rein in Pfas pollution.

The Republican-led House energy and commerce committee recently [held a hearing](https://energycommerce.house.gov/posts/environment-subcommittee-holds-hearing-on-the-current-statutory-and-regulatory-landscape-of-pfas) at which it invited representatives from the water treatment and landfill industries, among others, to make the case about why they should be exempted from rules that hold polluters financially accountable for the cleanup of two types of dangerous Pfas.

Donald Trump’s recent claims that the US should keep Venezuelan oil from seized tankers are part of a broader belief in rightwing “resource imperialism”, experts say.

In recent weeks, the Trump administration has escalated pressure on Venezuela, [invoking](https://x.com/SecWar/status/1989094923497316430) drug-trafficking claims. This month, the US intercepted two tankers carrying Venezuelan oil and began pursuing a third, while intensifying its campaign against the country’s president, Nicolás Maduro.

      <source:markdown>Trump has shown erratic and bizarre behavior throughout the year, leading to questions about his mental acuity

In an address from the White House in December, Donald Trump [claimed](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2001474404899807408) that, over the past 11 months, his administration had brought “more positive change” than any government in US history.

“There has never been anything like it,” Trump added.

America is respected again as a country. We were not respected with Biden. They looked at him falling down stairs every day. Every day, the guy’s falling down stairs.”

I said: ‘It’s not our president. We can’t have it.’ I’m very careful, you know, when I walk downstairs for – like I’m on stairs, like these stairs, I’m very – I walk very slowly. Nobody has to set a record, just try not to fall because it doesn’t work out well. A few of our presidents have fallen and it became a part of their legacy.

We don’t want that. Need to walk nice and easy. You not have – you don’t have to set any record. Be cool, be cool when you walk down, but don’t, don’t bop down the stairs. That’s the one thing with Obama, I had zero respect for him as a president, but he would bop down those stairs, I’ve never seen – da da da da da da, bop, bop, bop, he’d go down the stairs, wouldn’t hold on. I said, it’s great, I don’t want to do it. I guess I could do it, but eventually bad things are going to happen and it only takes once, but he did a lousy job as president.”

      <source:markdown>It has been a year dominated by Donald Trump. It has not yet even been 12 full months since his return to the White House in January but already the changes he has wrought – both in the US and around the world – seemed scarcely conceivable in 2024.

**Katharine Viner**, the Guardian’s editor-in-chief, tells **Annie Kelly** what it has looked like from the editor’s chair: from the deployment of the national guard on American streets, to the humiliation of Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office, to the erosion of the rules that once governed peace and war.

In the UK, she describes a Labour government failing to tell its story and missing chance after chance to tackle the rise of Reform and the far right. ‘Politics is about timing,’ she says of the government’s notable silence over the summer, ‘and I think a lot of those opportunities were missed.’

It has not been a year without hope, from the unexpected success of leftwing figures such as Zohran Mamdani and Zack Polanski, to the Guardian’s decisive victories in court defending its reporting, in a case described as a landmark ruling for #MeToo journalism.

As an aspiring basketball coach in his teens and early 20s, Alex Sarama was often met with snickers when he talked about the game he loved.

“There was a lot of skepticism,” he tells the Guardian. “A lot of coaches heard the accent and they’d say straight away this Alex guy can’t coach!”

The Department of Veterans Affairs can no longer provide abortions to veterans, including in cases of rape or incest, following a Department of Justice memo that found last week that the practice was not legally sound.

The ban follows months of efforts by the Trump administration to roll back a Biden-era policy that, for the first time, permitted the VAto counsel veterans and their families about abortion, as well as offer the procedure in cases of rape or incest, or when a veteran’s pregnancy imperiled their health. In August, [the administration filed paperwork](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/04/trump-abortion-veterans-affairs-hospitals) to officially roll back the policy, which had helped the VA’s network of 1,300-plus healthcare facilities – which treat nearly 10 million veterans each year – expand access to abortion, especially in the wake of the US supreme court’s 2022 overturning of Roe v Wade.

A drag queen Christmas tour has become an annual holiday tradition in Florida – and in recent years, so has the ensuing backlash.

Now in its 11th year, A Drag Queen Christmas, featuring performers from RuPaul’s Drag Race, will stop in the Florida Panhandle city of Pensacola on Tuesday night, despite state officials’ best efforts to cancel the show for what they claim is an “anti-Christian” performance at a city-owned theater.

      <source:markdown>Documents give further insight into former royal’s ties to sex offender and raise fresh questions for Donald Trump

Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor asked Jeffrey Epstein’s fixer Ghislaine Maxwell to arrange meetings with “inappropriate friends” while she sought “friendly and discreet and fun” girls on his behalf, the latest documents from the Epstein files appear to show.

The largest release yet of files concerning the financier and convicted child sex offender – which also raise fresh questions for the US president, Donald Trump – include emails in the name of “A” exchanging detailed messages with Maxwell that appeared to identify the author as Andrew.

Emails recording that Britain’s Metropolitan police contacted the FBI last month to inquire whether there were any ongoing investigations related to the disgraced former prince’s association with Epstein.

Emails showing US lawyers claiming “various factual inaccuracies” in a statement provided on Andrew’s behalf during their investigation of Epstein.

[Multiple references to Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/23/trump-flew-alone-on-jet-with-epstein-and-unnamed-20-year-old-files-suggests), including a claim by a senior US attorney that Trump was on a flight in the 1990s with Epstein and a 20-year-old woman. There is no indication of whether the woman was a victim of any crime, and Trump has consistently denied wrongdoing.

Files featuring redactions that were [found to be removable](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/23/epstein-unredacted-files-social-media) through Photoshop techniques or simply highlighting text to paste into a word processing file.

      <source:markdown>After years of fatalities and bizarre incidents, the Georgia reservoir has spawned countless ghost stories. Are they merely legend or the aftereffects of a history steeped in racial trauma?

Kile Glover was the entertainer in the family, the pride of his stepfather, the R&#38;B superstar Usher. He sang, he danced – he burned CDs of his own music, styled the covers with self-made art and was otherwise expressing his creativity in internet videos before it was trendy. “He would’ve been a YouTube sensation by now,” says his mother, the celebrity stylist Tameka Foster. But that future was thwarted on a family trip to Lake Lanier, just outside his Atlanta home town, in July 2012.

Kile was only 11 when he was struck by a speeding jetski while tubing and knocked unconscious. Foster, on the island of Saint Martin at the time, managed to get to Kile’s hospital bedside within hours thanks to Usher sending a private plane – an olive branch that came amid a [bitterly public](https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/tameka-raymond-ushers-status-helped-win-custody/story?id=19969051) custody battle over their two younger sons.

      <source:markdown>The very same immigrants welcomed to the US after risking their lives to fight the Taliban now fear detention or worse

      <source:markdown>Venezuela’s Nicolás Maduro warns Trump administration may ‘destabilise the entire region’ amid rising tensions

While all eyes are on the four-month-long US military campaign against Venezuela, the White House has been quietly striking security agreements with other countries to deploy US troops across Latin America and the Caribbean.

Good morning.

The number of people in immigration detention in the US has [hit an all-time high](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/22/ice-detentions-record-immigration), according to data published by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

**What are the demographics of people the administration is targeting for deportation?** In one of the biggest changes in immigration enforcement policies, immigrants with [no criminal record](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/21/deportations-us-government-shutdown-ice-data) continue to make up the largest group in US immigration detention, despite the administration’s rhetoric about focusing its anti-immigration efforts on “the worst of the worst” criminals. (Being undocumented in the US is a civil not a criminal infraction.)

**How are ordinary people fighting back?** As Trump carries out his mass deportation operation, [Julia Carrie Wong reports](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/18/ice-raids-fighting-back) on how residents are banding together to block raids and distribute groceries.

**What did Trump say about Clinton?** “I like Bill Clinton,” Trump said after he featured prominently in Friday’s cache of photos. “I hate to see photos come out of him but this is what the Democrats – mostly Democrats and a couple of bad Republicans – are asking for, so they’re giving their photos of me too.”

**Meanwhile, what’s happening on the Hill?** The Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, said yesterday he will introduce [a resolution](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/22/schumer-doj-epstein-senate-legal-action) directing the Senate to take legal action against the justice department – over its incomplete release of files.

Since, the White House has advocated for the build out of AI infrastructure and put a moratorium on state-level AI regulation. But the Trump administration also added a $100,000 fee to petitions for H-1B visas, which are widely used in the tech sector.

- Pair have won four NBA championships together


Warriors forward Draymond Green had a heated exchange with his head coach, Steve Kerr, in a third-quarter huddle during Monday night’s win over the Orlando Magic before leaving the court and heading to the locker room to calm down.

“We got into it obviously and I took the timeout just because I thought we lost our focus there a little bit,” Kerr said. “We had it out a little bit and he made his decision to go back to the locker room to cool off and that’s all I’m going to say about it. Everything is private. I’ve got nothing further to add.”
