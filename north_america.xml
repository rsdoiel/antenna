In a major study [released recently in Epidemiology](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/08/health/school-closures-mental-health.html), conclusions were drawn – yet again – regarding how shutdowns and online learning were ultimately very damaging to kids’ emotional and mental health (obviously some cohorts of kids were more affected than others with financial security a big part of the calculation). This is no major surprise as parents and students alike weren’t happy with the remote learning environment.

Yet despite this general consensus about online schooling not being as healthy as regular school, a new trend has exploded since Covid: the rapid growth of online schooling for tennis players and other athletes. Parents and their junior athletes feel that by being able to play several hours in the day instead of after school it will accelerate their progress in the sport while still leaving room for academics. And from my perspective, as a parent of a competitive tennis player who attends a “regular” school, it appears to be the rule, not the exception, that most advanced junior players are in online school and not in a physical building.

      <source:markdown>As the billionaire retires, he leaves memorable advice from his annual letters that include pithy takes on bubbles, discipline and long-term goals

Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor [who is retiring at the end of 2025](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/03/warren-buffett-retirement-berkshire-hathaway), has entertained and educated shareholders in his Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate for many years with his pithy annual letters outlining the firm’s performance.

Every year since 1965 he has updated his investors on the journey as Berkshire morphed from a “struggling northern textile business” with $25m of shareholder equity when he took over, to an empire worth more than $1tn.

Though the price I paid for Berkshire looked cheap, its business – a large northern textile operation – was headed for extinction.

My error caused Berkshire shareholders to give far more than they received (a practice that – despite the biblical endorsement – is far from blessed when you are buying businesses).

Woody Allen once explained why eclecticism works: ‘The real advantage of being bisexual is that it doubles your chances for a date on Saturday night.’

When such a CEO is encouraged by his advisers to make deals, he responds much as would a teenage boy who is encouraged by his father to have a normal sex life. It’s not a push he needs.

Andrew destroyed a few small insurers. Beyond that, it awakened some larger companies to the fact that their reinsurance protection against catastrophes was far from adequate. (It’s only when the tide goes out that you learn who’s been swimming naked.)

In our view, however, derivatives are financial weapons of mass destruction, carrying dangers that, while now latent, are potentially lethal.

Participants seeking to dodge troubles face the same problem as someone seeking to avoid venereal disease: it’s not just whom you sleep with, but also whom they are sleeping with.

From this irritating reality comes the first law of corporate survival for ambitious CEOs who pile on leverage and run large and unfathomable derivatives books: modest incompetence simply won’t do; it’s mind-boggling screw-ups that are required.

When downpours of that sort occur, it’s imperative that we rush outdoors carrying washtubs, not teaspoons. And that we will do.

Naturally, I was delighted to attend Mrs B’s birthday party. After all, she’s promised to attend _my_ 100th.

She sold me our interest when she was 89 and worked until she was 103. (After retiring, she died the next year, a sequence I point out to any other Berkshire manager who even thinks of retiring.)

The candidates are young to middle-aged, well-to-do to rich, and all wish to work for Berkshire for reasons that go beyond compensation.

(I’ve reluctantly discarded the notion of my continuing to manage the portfolio after my death – abandoning my hope to give new meaning to the term ‘thinking outside the box’.)

**Benjamin Netanyahu** is expected to tell **Donald Trump** on Monday that **Hamas must return the remains of the last Israeli hostage left in Gaza before the next stages of the stalled ceasefire can be implemented**, Israeli officials and analysts say.

The trip comes amid a **new push by officials in Washington to force concessions from Israel** to allow progress towards a second stage of the ceasefire in [Gaza](https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza), which began in October after two years of devastating war.

He feels he has a number of cards to play yet and the remains of Gvili is the easiest one to play now but there are others.

Netanyahu knows exactly what he wants for Christmas – more of the same. Israeli troops stay in 51% of Gaza, periodically striking Hamas … without the shadow of withdrawal looming over him. None of this requires a denunciation of the \[Trump\] plan itself and Trump can very easily justify Israel’s extended stay on Hamas’s unwillingness to disarm.

      <source:markdown>Gaza not covered in announcement and will be handled on separate track, says US state department official

The United States on Monday pledged $2bn in assistance to tens of millions of people facing hunger and disease in more than a dozen countries next year, part of what it said was a new mechanism for the delivery of life-saving assistance following major foreign aid cuts by the Trump administration.

The US slashed its aid spending this year, and leading western donors such as Germany also pared back assistance as they pivoted to increased defense spending, triggering a severe funding crunch for the UN. The billions of dollars in assistance pledged by Washington on Monday will be overseen by the UN office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs, the state department said, under what it described as new model of assistance agreed with the UN that aims to make aid funding and delivery more efficient and increase accountability for the spending of funds.

In the past decade at the forefront of US politics, Donald Trump has unleashed a barrage of unusual, misleading or dubious assertions about the climate crisis, which he most famously called a “hoax”.

This year has seen Trump ratchet up his often questionable claims about the environment and how to deal, if at all, with the threats to it. In a year littered with lies and wild declarations, these are the five that stood out as the most startling.

      <source:markdown>Exclusive poll: Americans are also increasingly blaming the White House for their financial woes

Twice as many Americans believe their financial security is getting worse than better, according to an exclusive new poll conducted for the Guardian, and they are increasingly blaming the White House.

The poll, conducted by Harris, will be a further blow to Donald Trump’s efforts to fight off criticism of his handling of the economy and contains some worrying findings for the president.

Nearly half (45%) of Americans said their financial security is getting worse compared to 20% who said it’s getting better.

57% of Americans said the US economy is undergoing a recession, up 11% from a similar poll that was conducted in February.

Inglewood, California – a few miles east of Los Angeles international airport – is known as the city of champions. The NBA champion Lakers once called Inglewood’s Forum – famously dubbed “the fabulous Forum” by announcer Chick Hearn – home.

By the mid-2000s, with the Lakers gone and another local landmark – nearby Hollywood Park racetrack – closed, the city was close to bankruptcy. Then came a series of deals – often attributed to the leadership of the mayor James Butts – that reinvigorated the city, as a new epicenter of sports and entertainment such as the new spaceship-like SoFi Stadium and the Intuit Dome.

A man in [Oklahoma](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/oklahoma) is facing a manslaughter charge after he allegedly shot a woman several blocks from his home while firing a gun he got himself for Christmas at an energy drink can in his back yard.

As told in court documents reviewed by [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/oklahoma-man-fatally-shooting-woman-target-practicing-backyard-rcna251138), the death of Sandra Phelps at the hands of Cody Wayne Adams illustrates how deadly the consequences can be when those engaging in the US’s prevalent gun culture do so unsafely. Adams’s back yard was not equipped to stop bullets from leaving the property and striking unsuspecting people in the surrounding area, according to authorities.

[Democrats’ soul-searching](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/08/democrats-trump-elections) began even before it was clear Donald Trump would return to the White House. But their devastating losses in the 2024 election threw the party’s problems into stark relief, prompting a wave of competing explanations from inflation and the border to Gaza, Joe Biden’s age, Kamala Harris’s clipped campaign, “woke” policies, an anti-incumbent mood or, more likely, some combination of them all.

By the mid-2000s, [Jeffrey Epstein](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein)’s sexual abuse of teen girls was routine.

A mix of snow and ice bore down on the US north-east early on Saturday, disrupting post-holiday weekend airline traffic and prompting officials in [New York](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york) and [New Jersey](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-jersey) to issue weather emergency declarations even as the storm ebbed by mid-morning.

More than 14,400 domestic US flights on Saturday were canceled or delayed as of mid-morning, with the majority in the New York area, including at John F Kennedy international airport, LaGuardia airport and Newark Liberty international airport, according to the tracking site FlightAware.

      <source:markdown>Rule allows minority party to block legislation, but GOP is reluctant to scrap it as they could lose majority

[Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump) has floated the idea of ending the filibuster – a procedural technique in [Congress](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-congress) that allows a minority of senators to block legislation from passing – which would make pushing through his political agenda in 2026 much easier.

In an interview with [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/27/trump-to-politico-midterm-elections-will-be-about-pricing-00706877), the president urged [Republicans](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans) in the [Senate](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-senate) to scrap the filibuster, saying it had become an obstacle to effective governing and removing it would prevent another government shutdown and pave the way for his party to push through its legislative priorities.

Suze Lopez, a 41-year-old emergency room nurse in Bakersfield, California, delivered baby Ryu via surgery in August, so the newborn is celebrating his first Christmas. He had been an ectopic pregnancy – when a fertilized egg implants and grows outside the uterus – and was hidden behind a large ovarian cyst.

It’s been a year for the history books in the House of Representatives.

      <source:markdown>Fiber artists across the US are using their craft to protest against everything from national guard deployments to rollbacks on abortion rights

In early October, Tracy Wright invited a group of other women in her social circle – all fellow knitters – to gather outside the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in their home town of Portland, Oregon. They were “armed with their weapons of mass construction”.

The US defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, has warned of new strikes against Islamic State targets in north-western Nigeria, hours after the US military took action against militant camps in what Donald Trump has characterised as efforts to stop the killing of Christians.

Hegseth [wrote on X](https://x.com/PeteHegseth/status/2004332431542022289?s=20): “The president was clear last month: the killing of innocent Christians in Nigeria (and elsewhere) must end.

For more than a decade he built his brand on two words: “You’re fired!” And in his first term in the White House, [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump) did not hesitate to show his staff the door, often via an abrasive tweet.

But since resuming the US presidency in January, Trump, the former host of the reality TV show [The Apprentice](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/10/trump-the-apprentice-president-elect-reality-tv), appears to have become an uncharacteristically bashful boss, more disposed to hiring than firing.

For half a century, psychedelics largely belonged to the cultural left: anti-war, anti-capitalist, suspicious of the church and state. Now, one of the most politically consequential psychedelic drugs in the US – ibogaine – is being championed by evangelical Christians, Republican governors, military veterans, and big tech billionaires.

Many of them see ibogaine, an intense psychedelic derived from a central African rootbark, as a divine technology. In fact, some pointedly do not refer to it as a psychedelic, given the apparent baggage of the term in some circles.

      <source:markdown>After the writers’ and actors’ strikes, the pandemic, and structural shifts in technology, LA’s trying to find its footing in a changed industry

The veteran Hollywood cinematographer Bruce McCleery knows all about Los Angeles’s struggles to maintain its dominance in the entertainment industry, because for most of the past 16 years he has lived on the road, never short of work but unable to land a major job within striking distance of his home and family in southern California.

It’s an increasingly common experience for many successful professionals in Hollywood who are hired by studios and production houses still largely based in Los Angeles, but do the actual work in Atlanta, or Toronto, or London, or Budapest.

      <source:markdown>More than a year after the storm ripped apart families and farms, growers are bullish about strength of their industry

Christmas tree farmers in western North Carolina are still rebuilding from last year’s devastating [Hurricane Helene](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hurricane-helene), but growers are optimistic about business and the overall strength of their industry in the region.

“There’s still a lot of recovery that needs to happen, but we’re in much better shape than we were this time last year … sales are good,” Kevin Gray, owner of Hickory Creek Farm Christmas Trees in Greensboro, said earlier this month, while the buying season was in full swing.

Happy holidays! Across the 12 days of Christmas one very keen individual once gifted their lover a partridge in a pear tree, two turtle doves, three French hens, four calling birds, five gold rings, six geese a-laying, seven swans a-swimming, eight maids a-milking, nine ladies dancing, 10 lords a-leaping, 11 pipers piping and 12 drummers drumming.

An extravagant expression of what was allegedly “true love”, the spree amounted to a total of 364 presents – more if you include the eggs that the geese a-laid.

Any Lucia López Belloza will not be home for Christmas. The 19-year-old freshman was on a business scholarship at Babson College near Boston, when she decided to take a surprise flight home to Austin, Texas, to spend Thanksgiving with her parents and sisters.

Just before she boarded her flight at Logan airport on 20 November, she was [arrested by federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/08/ice-family-college-student-deported-honduras) and within 48 hours was deported back to Honduras, a country she left aged seven seeking asylum, with chains on her waist, ankles and wrists.

Donald Trump’s recent claims that the US should keep Venezuelan oil from seized tankers are part of a broader belief in rightwing “resource imperialism”, experts say.

In recent weeks, the Trump administration has escalated pressure on Venezuela, [invoking](https://x.com/SecWar/status/1989094923497316430) drug-trafficking claims. This month, the US intercepted two tankers carrying Venezuelan oil and began pursuing a third, while intensifying its campaign against the country’s president, Nicolás Maduro.

Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said on Tuesday that guard members, as they have in other deployments in large cities, will be tasked with supporting federal law enforcement partners, including the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security. Parnell added that the national guard troops will be deployed through February.

      <source:markdown>Trump has shown erratic and bizarre behavior throughout the year, leading to questions about his mental acuity

In an address from the White House in December, Donald Trump [claimed](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/2001474404899807408) that, over the past 11 months, his administration had brought “more positive change” than any government in US history.

“There has never been anything like it,” Trump added.

America is respected again as a country. We were not respected with Biden. They looked at him falling down stairs every day. Every day, the guy’s falling down stairs.”

I said: ‘It’s not our president. We can’t have it.’ I’m very careful, you know, when I walk downstairs for – like I’m on stairs, like these stairs, I’m very – I walk very slowly. Nobody has to set a record, just try not to fall because it doesn’t work out well. A few of our presidents have fallen and it became a part of their legacy.

We don’t want that. Need to walk nice and easy. You not have – you don’t have to set any record. Be cool, be cool when you walk down, but don’t, don’t bop down the stairs. That’s the one thing with Obama, I had zero respect for him as a president, but he would bop down those stairs, I’ve never seen – da da da da da da, bop, bop, bop, he’d go down the stairs, wouldn’t hold on. I said, it’s great, I don’t want to do it. I guess I could do it, but eventually bad things are going to happen and it only takes once, but he did a lousy job as president.”

      <source:markdown>It has been a year dominated by Donald Trump. It has not yet even been 12 full months since his return to the White House in January but already the changes he has wrought – both in the US and around the world – seemed scarcely conceivable in 2024.

**Katharine Viner**, the Guardian’s editor-in-chief, tells **Annie Kelly** what it has looked like from the editor’s chair: from the deployment of the national guard on American streets, to the humiliation of Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office, to the erosion of the rules that once governed peace and war.

In the UK, she describes a Labour government failing to tell its story and missing chance after chance to tackle the rise of Reform and the far right. ‘Politics is about timing,’ she says of the government’s notable silence over the summer, ‘and I think a lot of those opportunities were missed.’

It has not been a year without hope, from the unexpected success of leftwing figures such as Zohran Mamdani and Zack Polanski, to the Guardian’s decisive victories in court defending its reporting, in a case described as a landmark ruling for #MeToo journalism.

As an aspiring basketball coach in his teens and early 20s, Alex Sarama was often met with snickers when he talked about the game he loved.

“There was a lot of skepticism,” he tells the Guardian. “A lot of coaches heard the accent and they’d say straight away this Alex guy can’t coach!”

A drag queen Christmas tour has become an annual holiday tradition in Florida – and in recent years, so has the ensuing backlash.

Now in its 11th year, A Drag Queen Christmas, featuring performers from RuPaul’s Drag Race, will stop in the Florida Panhandle city of Pensacola on Tuesday night, despite state officials’ best efforts to cancel the show for what they claim is an “anti-Christian” performance at a city-owned theater.

      <source:markdown>Documents give further insight into former royal’s ties to sex offender and raise fresh questions for Donald Trump

Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor asked Jeffrey Epstein’s fixer Ghislaine Maxwell to arrange meetings with “inappropriate friends” while she sought “friendly and discreet and fun” girls on his behalf, the latest documents from the Epstein files appear to show.

The largest release yet of files concerning the financier and convicted child sex offender – which also raise fresh questions for the US president, Donald Trump – include emails in the name of “A” exchanging detailed messages with Maxwell that appeared to identify the author as Andrew.

Emails recording that Britain’s Metropolitan police contacted the FBI last month to inquire whether there were any ongoing investigations related to the disgraced former prince’s association with Epstein.

Emails showing US lawyers claiming “various factual inaccuracies” in a statement provided on Andrew’s behalf during their investigation of Epstein.

[Multiple references to Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/23/trump-flew-alone-on-jet-with-epstein-and-unnamed-20-year-old-files-suggests), including a claim by a senior US attorney that Trump was on a flight in the 1990s with Epstein and a 20-year-old woman. There is no indication of whether the woman was a victim of any crime, and Trump has consistently denied wrongdoing.

Files featuring redactions that were [found to be removable](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/23/epstein-unredacted-files-social-media) through Photoshop techniques or simply highlighting text to paste into a word processing file.

Georgia’s historic racketeering case in connection with opposition to the police training center known as Cop City continues hanging over the heads of 61 defendants, drawing into focus the state’s continuing possession of hundreds of cellphones, laptops and personal items.

The state’s case is believed to be the largest ever leveled against a protest or social movement using Rico, a law created to go after the mafia and usually associated with organized crime but here deployed against a largely environmental and criminal justice-focused movement.

Good morning.

The number of people in immigration detention in the US has [hit an all-time high](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/22/ice-detentions-record-immigration), according to data published by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

**What are the demographics of people the administration is targeting for deportation?** In one of the biggest changes in immigration enforcement policies, immigrants with [no criminal record](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/21/deportations-us-government-shutdown-ice-data) continue to make up the largest group in US immigration detention, despite the administration’s rhetoric about focusing its anti-immigration efforts on “the worst of the worst” criminals. (Being undocumented in the US is a civil not a criminal infraction.)

**How are ordinary people fighting back?** As Trump carries out his mass deportation operation, [Julia Carrie Wong reports](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/18/ice-raids-fighting-back) on how residents are banding together to block raids and distribute groceries.

**What did Trump say about Clinton?** “I like Bill Clinton,” Trump said after he featured prominently in Friday’s cache of photos. “I hate to see photos come out of him but this is what the Democrats – mostly Democrats and a couple of bad Republicans – are asking for, so they’re giving their photos of me too.”

**Meanwhile, what’s happening on the Hill?** The Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, said yesterday he will introduce [a resolution](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/22/schumer-doj-epstein-senate-legal-action) directing the Senate to take legal action against the justice department – over its incomplete release of files.

      <source:markdown>In January, we saw a who&#39;s who of tech leaders front and center at President Donald Trump&#39;s inauguration.

Since, the White House has advocated for the build out of AI infrastructure and put a moratorium on state-level AI regulation. But the Trump administration also added a $100,000 fee to petitions for H-1B visas, which are widely used in the tech sector.

To review the year in tech and Trump we called up Suyash Pasi, a research analyst and editor at the nonprofit Human Rights Research Center, who’s been following this shift.</source:markdown>

Everything is private. I’ve got nothing further to add.”

More than 100 organizations that support victims of [human trafficking](https://www.theguardian.com/law/human-trafficking) have lost funding since October, leaving thousands of survivors at risk, a Guardian investigation has found.

Anti-trafficking advocates say the US Department of Justice’s failure to spend nearly $90m appropriated by [Congress](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-congress) is impeding law-enforcement investigations and exposing survivors to homelessness and the risk of deportation, jail time or re-exploitation.

Good morning.

A document among the tranche of newly released Jeffrey Epstein files [casts fresh light](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/22/ghislaine-maxwell-jeffrey-epstein-files) on psychological tricks that his ex-girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell deployed in her effort to lure vulnerable teenage girls into his abusive orbit.

Donald Trump, having promised to “NEVER LET OUR FARMERS DOWN”, appeared to come through for them this month when he unveiled a $12bn aid package. Industry leaders say thousands of farms will still go bust this year.

While the US president has vowed to increase domestic farm production, and even claimed this formed a “big part” of his plan to lower grocery prices for Americans, many US farmers are grappling with mounting financial issues – compounded by Trump’s agenda.

A book titled Massage for Dummies was seen among the partial files released yesterday by the Department of Justice. It is mentioned as one of the “gifts” Epstein gave to a “girl” whose name is redacted.

Various reports say Epstein would often request massages from his victims – for both himself and others in his circle.

Many of the documents in the data dump were heavily redacted, with text blacked out so it was impossible to read. Norm Eisen, executive chair of Democracy Defenders Fund, said: “What they have released is clearly incomplete and appears to be over-redacted to boot.”

The documents extensively featured photos of former president Bill Clinton, a Democrat, and appeared to include few if any photos of Trump or documents mentioning him, despite Trump and Epstein’s well-publicised friendship in the 1990s and early 2000s.

Lawyers for Luigi Mangione are attempting to avoid the death penalty and throw out two federal charges in the justice department’s case against him, arguing that attorney general Pam Bondi is biased because she used to work at a lobbying firm that represents UnitedHealth Group.

In court documents filed on Friday, Mangione’s lawyers said that Bondi has a “profound conflict of interest” because her former employer, Ballard Partners, a DC-based lobbying firm founded by the Trump donor Brian Ballard, counts UnitedHealth Group as one of its clients.

During the five days he spent in Brazil, Newsom described Donald Trump as an “ [invasive species](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/nov/11/gavin-newsom-trump-cop30)” and condemned his rollback of policies aimed at reducing emissions and expanding renewable energy.

      <source:markdown>US president has been blatant in his appointment of relatives, close friends and big donors – almost none of whom have diplomatic experience

When your goal is to “help Europe correct its current trajectory” because it is “weak”, “decaying” and facing “civilisational erasure”, your choice of highly trained operatives for the mission is plainly of paramount importance.

In Donald Trump’s case they include: a former burger magnate; his eldest son’s former fiancee; the owner of the Houston Rockets basketball team; a producer of Broadway musicals; PayPal’s co-founder; and a convicted felon who is also his son-in-law’s father.

Democratic lawmakers will release more photographs from evidence gathered from the estate of Jeffrey Epstein if the Department of Justice fails to meet the Friday deadline to disclose investigative documents, Congressman Robert Garcia told CNN yesterday.

Speaking to [Erin Burnett](https://x.com/i/status/2001475597109772655), Garcia said a petition to the federal court by Ghislaine Maxwell – Epstein’s convicted accomplice - to have her conviction on sex trafficking charges thrown out and to obtain a pardon do not trigger an exemption to the law Congress passed mandating a release of documents by the DoJ.

      <source:markdown>As Trump carries out his mass deportation operation, residents are banding together to block raids and distribute groceries

A year into his second term, Donald Trump’s [pledge](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/oct/31/election-trump-immigration-policies) to stage the “largest deportation operation in American history” has already made an indelible mark on the nation.

Nearly 300,000 people have been [deported](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/aug/29/trump-immigration-ice-cbp-data), and a record 65,000 people are being held in detention centers. Aggressive raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents, sometimes with the backing of federalized national guard units, have terrorized immigrant communities from Charlotte to Chicago, New Orleans to New York.

      <source:markdown>Longest federal government shutdown meant data was only collected for second half of November

US prices rose 2.7% in the year to November, according to federal data released a day after [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump) claimed they were falling “very fast” on his watch.

The latest consumer price index, released on Wednesday morning, was down from 3% in September, and short of economists’ expectations of about 3.1% for last month.

In the past, a fan’s ability to attend a World Cup hosted in their nation hinged more on bid books than their checkbooks. For 2026 in the US, Mexico and Canada, even the least expensive tickets are a luxury commodity by comparison.

An analysis by the Guardian of men’s World Cup ticket pricing shows that amid the general rise in ticket prices for the 2026 World Cup, the most extreme of those hikes have often applied to the cheapest tickets. The analysis is based on official Fifa pricing dating back to 1994, with more robust data available starting in 2006. Prices for 2026 games are accurate as of 16 December 2025, and do not include the [1.6% of sellable tickets](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/dec/16/fifa-world-cup-pricing-tier-supporters-entry) for each game that Fifa recently made available for a fixed $60 price.

      <source:markdown>Experts decry Jason Reding Quiñones’s ‘fishing expedition’ as subpoenas reportedly issued to John Brennan and others

A Maga loyalist US attorney in Miami is expanding an investigation of ex-FBI and intelligence officials who incurred Donald’s Trump’s wrath with an inquiry into how Russia helped him win in 2016, despite the US justice department suffering stinging recent court rejections of indictments of two foes of the US president.

The Australian classification review board has overturned a decision to block Australians seeing footage of the shooting of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk on social media after Elon Musk’s X appealed against the ruling sought by the eSafety commissioner.

After [Kirk’s death at Utah Valley University](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/11/charlie-kirk-murder-suspect-court-appearance) on 10 September, the eSafety commissioner applied to the board to have video of the shooting classified in Australia. The video was ruled to be “refused classification”, which allowed eSafety to serve notices on social media platforms ordering them to geo-block the posts from view for Australia-based users.

Wiles also said she had told **Donald Trump** that his second term was not supposed to be a retribution tour.

**I don’t think he \[Trump\] wakes up thinking about retribution. But when there’s an opportunity, he will go for it**.

Good morning.

Donald Trump is [suing the BBC for $10bn over its editing of a speech](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/15/trump-bbc-lawsuit) he made to supporters before the storming of the US Capitol in 2021.

**On what basis is Trump suing?** He’s seeking $5bn in damages on each of two counts: alleging that the BBC defamed him, and that it violated Florida’s Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act.

**What roadblocks remain to a deal?** The main one is the future of the Ukrainian territories occupied by Russia.

**What’s Donald Trump’s view on this?** He’s appeared to suggest that to receive security guarantees, Ukraine must cede the parts of the eastern Donbas region that it still holds to Russia – something Volodymyr Zelenskyy has previously rejected.

This is a developing story. [Follow the latest in our live blog.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/dec/16/ukraine-peace-talks-russia-europe-us-trump-latest-news-updates)

Precisely 85 years ago, one of the most fearsome heavyweight boxers in history stunk out the joint. Joe Louis was in the midst of his “Bum of the Month club”: a staggering run of 13 world title defences in 29 months against an assortment of stiffs, wild men and colourful characters. And when he arrived in Boston on 16 December 1940, most believed that Al McCoy would rapidly become his next victim. Only it didn’t quite turn out that way.

“McCoy was expected to crumple under the first punch Louis tossed in his direction,” the New York Times’ correspondent wrote. “Instead, the wily New England veteran made Louis appear ludicrous at times. Adopting a crouching, bobbing, weaving style, McCoy was an elusive target for the paralysing fists of the titleholder.” After the messy contest was stopped at the end of the fifth, a storm of jeers rang out. Louis had won, but only his bank balance had been enhanced.

A US immigrant with legal status and her two American children have filed a lawsuit against ICE, after they were hospitalized following a “violent” and “unlawful” detention in Massachusetts.

Hilda Ramirez Sanan, a green card holder who has lived in the United States for more than 20 years, and her two US citizen children were “illegally and forcefully detained”, [the lawsuit](https://www.masslive.com/boston/2025/12/legal-immigrant-mother-blasts-ice-after-agents-smashed-window-traumatized-her-family.html) alleges.

      <source:markdown>Danny Ceisler’s defeat in sheriff’s race of incumbent who had signed an agreement to work with ICE sends a message on US’s contentious debate around immigration policy

Only 40 miles north of Philadelphia, Bucks county has gained a reputation as the “swingiest” county in the swing state of Pennsylvania and one of the most pivotal political bellwethers in the country.

Party registration in the county is [almost evenly split](https://www.buckscounty.gov/186/Voter-Statistics) among Democrats and Republicans. Joe Biden won it in 2020, Donald Trump triumphed there in 2024. November’s elections there were local – but a hot race for county sheriff drew much wider attention as a microcosm for America’s contentious debate around immigration policy – and the result signaled a shake-up in how the county approaches enforcement.

Law enforcement and public health experts are sounding the alarm as the Trump administration has prioritized waging its “war on drugs” outside US shores, including with a controversial bombing campaign of fishing boats off the coast of Venezuela.

That’s been true for probably 40 years, since they lurched into financial crisis amid boardroom shenanigans in the 1980s, becoming the first soccer club to list on the stock exchange and embarking on a disastrous programme of diversification (the highlight perhaps being becoming Hummel’s distributor in the UK, a role they performed so badly that Southampton took a page of their own programme to blame Spurs for the fact that their shirts were not being delivered).</p><p>Right now, Spurs would probably settle for even a little bit of a fix, a slow hint of progress, a flicker of hope, anything to break them out of the current grim spiral.

Sunday’s defeat <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague/table">leaves them 11th</a>, 14 points behind Arsenal. Given that Spurs finished 17th last season, perhaps that is not so unexpected – and the compacted nature of the table means they are only four points off fifth and probable Champions League qualification. But, equally, 22 points represents their lowest Premier League tally after 16 games since 2008.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/dec/15/tottenham-hotspur-thomas-frank-premier-league">Continue reading...</a>]]>

Tottenham Hotspur, Thomas Frank said after Sunday’s [3-0 defeat to Nottingham Forest](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/dec/14/nottingham-forest-tottenham-premier-league-match-report), are “not a quick fix”. That’s been true for probably 40 years, since they lurched into financial crisis amid boardroom shenanigans in the 1980s, becoming the first soccer club to list on the stock exchange and embarking on a disastrous programme of diversification (the highlight perhaps being becoming Hummel’s distributor in the UK, a role they performed so badly that Southampton took a page of their own programme to blame Spurs for the fact that their shirts were not being delivered).

Right now, Spurs would probably settle for even a little bit of a fix, a slow hint of progress, a flicker of hope, anything to break them out of the current grim spiral. They have won just one of their last seven league games. When they beat Everton on 26 October, they were third, five points behind the leaders. Sunday’s defeat [leaves them 11th](https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague/table), 14 points behind Arsenal. Given that Spurs finished 17th last season, perhaps that is not so unexpected – and the compacted nature of the table means they are only four points off fifth and probable Champions League qualification. But, equally, 22 points represents their lowest Premier League tally after 16 games since 2008.

      <source:markdown>A person who was taken into custody after two people were killed and several more critically injured was later released

Two people have been killed and several more critically injured in a shooting at Brown University, in Providence, Rhode Island. Here’s what we know so far:

**A person in their 20s was taken into custody on Sunday morning, but then released later in the day**. Police chief Col Oscar Perez declined to say whether the person of interest was the same person seen in surveillance footage released by authorities on Saturday. Officials did not name the person. **The person was later released without charge as the authorities said the evidence took the investigation in “a different direction”.**

**A shooter dressed in black [killed at least two people and wounded nine others at Brown University](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/13/brown-university-shooting) during final exams** on the Ivy League campus.

**Brown University president Christina Paxson confirmed that the two people killed were students**. A shelter-in-place in effect for the area was lifted on Sunday morning.

**Eight people with gunshot wounds were taken to Rhode Island hospital**, where seven were in critical but stable condition, Paxson said on Sunday. One person remains in a critical condition, she added. One other student was discharged from hospital on Saturday night and left with their parents, Paxson said.

**Providence’s mayor Brett Smiley said he had visited the victims of the attack in hospital,** praising their resilience and the efforts of emergency medical staff who treated them.

**The two slain have been [identified](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/15/brown-university-shooting-victims) by loved ones as** **Ella Cook** **, a second-year Brown student from Alabama, and** **MukhammadAziz Umurzokov** **, an Uzbek national in his first year of studies at the Ivy League institution.** Cook was vice-president of Brown’s chapter of College Republicans of America, and Umurzokov had dreams of becoming a neurosurgeon, those who knew them have said.

**The university [announced](https://president.brown.edu/president/parents-and-families-campus-operations-after-yesterdays-tragedy) that all remaining classes, exams, papers and projects were cancelled for the rest of the semester.**

**Officials refused to say whether a gun used in the attack had been found.** A small Glock handgun with a laser sight attached and a revolver were found in a hotel room where the person of interest was apprehended, federal law enforcement sources have told CNN.

**Law enforcement agencies were seen at a Hampton Inn hotel in Coventry, Rhode Island, roping off rooms as part of the investigation into the shooting.** An FBI agent said the person of interest had been arrested at the hotel, which is a short drive from Brown University.

**The FBI used cellphone data to locate the person of interest, the agency’s director Kash Patel said.**

**Donald Trump paid tribute to the victims in the attack.** Speaking at the White House, the US president said: “I want to just pay my respects to the people, unfortunately two are no longer with us, Brown University, nine injured and two are looking down on us right now from Heaven.” The president added: “So to the nine injured: get well fast. And to the families of those two that are no longer with us: I pay my deepest regards and respects, from the United States of America. Thank you very much. It’s a very important thing to say, and we mean it.”

The Heritage Foundation, an influential rightwing thinktank [currently mired in controversy](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/nov/20/nick-fuentes-tucker-carlson) over its president’s apparent apology for extremism, has appointed as a director the founder of a secretive all-male network of Christian nationalist fraternal lodges.

A person of interest detained after a mass shooting at Brown University that killed two students and injured nine has been released after the investigation took law enforcement authorities in a “different direction”, officials said Sunday night.

The disclosure was made at a hastily convened [late night news conference](https://www.youtube.com/live/p2LyhsA-IAc?si=wZ3SUaSYyINkZ7jb&#38;t=908) to address the killings that have rattled the Ivy League campus. It came more than 12 hours after officials had announced that they had taken a person into custody. The Rhode Island attorney general, Peter Neronha, said authorities had since concluded there is “no basis to consider him a person of interest.”

The release leaves law enforcement without any publicly disclosed suspect, with officials pledging to redouble efforts in the investigation by canvassing for video surveillance that could help pinpoint the killer’s identity.

      <source:markdown>In at least half a dozen states, librarians have joined forces with civil rights groups to oppose book bans, often facing personal and professional repercussions

For decades, libraries served as a safe haven for many queer and marginalized youths in eastern Texas, says former county library director Rhea Young. Unlike the school cafeteria, the library was a space where they could explore and find acceptance in who they wanted to be.

“There were books where they can find characters like them, and realize it’s okay to be who they are,” Young said. “There needs to be more places like that, not fewer.”

Farm worker Owen Salmon has picked apples in upstate New York for almost a decade, some 1,500 miles (2,400km) from home. In the midst of harvest season this year, [Hurricane Melissa](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/28/hurricane-melissa-makes-landfall-in-jamaica), a record-breaking category 5 hurricane, made landfall in Jamaica.

“It was terrifying,” said Salmon, whose wife and two children were at home near Black River, a town on the country’s south-western coast. “For days, I couldn’t hear from them. When I finally did, I heard my roof was completely gone. My wife and kids had to run for their lives, but thank God they’re alive.”

[Universal basic income](https://www.theguardian.com/society/universal-basic-income) (UBI) is back, like a space zombie in a sci-fi movie, resurrected from policy oblivion, hungry for policymakers’ attention: brains!

Andrew Yang, whose “Yang Gang” enthusiasm briefly shook up the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020 promoting a “Freedom Dividend” to save workers from automation – $1,000 a month for every American adult – is again the main carrier of the bug: offering UBI to save the nation when robots eat all our jobs.

Before the street outside her mother’s home filled with gunfire, before panicked partygoers sprinted through the front yard, before she discovered that the body on the ground was a young man she had watched grow up, Khlilia Daniels knew something in Bogalusa had to change.

It was December of 2022, and Daniels had spent the year watching her home town on Louisiana’s border with Mississippi become a steadily more frightening place. Murders, once rare, now seemed to be happening almost every month, shootings every other week, and in a city of just over 10,000 people, that violence felt close, the losses personal.

Good morning.

The alleged gunmen behind the [Bondi beach terror attack are a father and son](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/dec/15/bondi-beach-terror-attack-father-son-duo-alleged-behind-shooting-licensed-firearms-ntwnfb) suspected of using legally obtained firearms to commit the massacre, according to police.

**Were either known to the authorities?** Naveed Akram was examined by security agencies in October 2019 because of his alleged associations with others, said the prime minister, Anthony Albanese. [He said](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/dec/14/bondi-beach-shooting-live-updates-victims-terror-attack-jewish-festival-hanukah?filterKeyEvents=false&#38;page=with%3Ablock-693fcaaf8f08ff9b9e8574e0#block-693fcaaf8f08ff9b9e8574e0) the alleged shooters were not thought to be “part of a wider \[terrorist\] cell”.

**Are gun laws being discussed?** Yes, the New South Wales premier, Chris Minns, said there would “almost certainly” be changes to gun laws, and police were investigating whether there had been a failure of their systems in relation to how licensed weapons could have been used in a terror attack.

This is a developing story: [follow the latest updates on our liveblog](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/dec/14/bondi-beach-shooting-live-updates-victims-terror-attack-jewish-festival-hanukah?page=with%3Ablock-693fcaaf8f08ff9b9e8574e0#block-693fcaaf8f08ff9b9e8574e0).

With subsidies for Affordable Care Act (ACA) health insurance set to expire, Americans who rely on them will probably switch to plans with lower monthly premiums and high deductibles or decide not to purchase any coverage, which will have a serious and damaging impact on the entire sector, according to healthcare policy experts.

Founded by Jimmy Glenn, a former boxer turned trainer, in 1971, Jimmy’s Corner has stood, defiantly unchanged, as Times Square has boomed around it.

The neighborhood bar, a New York City institution which attracts locals and tourists alike, has had the same pictures on the walls for decades – some of the bar’s regulars have been coming almost as long – kept the same furniture, and maintained remarkably low pricing. In a perhaps unintentional nod to its history, there is also several years’ accumulation of dust in some areas.

I’m surprised because to me he’s a sleepy son of a bitch.”

Exulting in Biden’s drowsiness, the US president and his supporters seemed blissfully ignorant of a rich irony: that 79-year-old Trump himself has recently been spotted apparently dozing off at various meetings.

How do you create a foreign policy manifesto for a US president who leads from the gut?

The initial draft fell to Michael Anton, a Maga firebrand whom officials have called the lead author behind the US’s radical new national security strategy (NSS). The document shocked US allies, warning that immigration to Europe would cause “ [civilizational erasure](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/05/civilisational-erasure-us-strategy-document-appears-to-echo-far-right-conspiracy-theories-about-europe)”, reviving the Monroe doctrine in the western hemisphere, and downgrading the US’s responsibility for great power competition with China and Russia.

Two burrowing owls stowed away on a cruise ship out of Miami, and are now living the high life at a Spanish resort before returning to the US next month.

Biologists from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) said the mating pair boarded Royal Caribbean’s Allure of the Seas before the vessel’s transatlantic crossing to Cartagena in southern Spain in February. The tiny owls, a threatened species in Florida, usually prefer more rural landscapes, and may have been spooked by all the concrete around the Port of Miami, they say.

      <source:markdown>With Trump championing Pete Rose and pressuring MLB’s commissioner, the Hall of Fame vote became a referendum on power, memory and whether integrity still matters

Since mid-May, when Major League Baseball commissioner Rob Manfred announced Pete Rose [would be eligible for Hall of Fame consideration](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/may/15/pete-rose-hall-of-fame-baseball) and [explained his specious reasonings behind it](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jun/05/mlb-commissioner-manfred-admits-he-paid-attention-to-trump-when-overturning-pete-rose-ban), last week’s Hall of Fame vote by the 16-member Classic Era committee carried with it a certain air of inevitability for Roger Clemens and Barry Bonds, the two greatest players currently not enshrined in Cooperstown.

Rose was championed by Donald Trump, who used his populism to demand the Hit King finally be allowed into the Hall, an honor denied Rose since 1989 when baseball placed him on the permanently ineligible list for betting on games when he managed the Cincinnati Reds. After Rose [died in September 2024](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/sep/30/pete-rose-dies-mlb-baseball), Trump then won the presidency five weeks later and immediately increased the pressure on Manfred to end Rose’s 36-year banishment – despite the absence of any evidence suggesting Rose was any less guilty in death of gambling on the sport than he had been alive.

      <title>Hunger’s whip: why connecting US food stamps to work is outdated and ineffective</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/12/snap-food-stamp-work-requirement</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>In many parts of the country, there are new work requirements to get food aid. But starving people doesn’t motivate them – despite centuries of this rhetoric</p><p>For more than 200 years, common wisdom and policymakers have assumed that to get people to work, you had to make them hungry.

      <source:markdown>In many parts of the country, there are new work requirements to get food aid. But starving people doesn’t motivate them – despite centuries of this rhetoric

For more than 200 years, common wisdom and policymakers have assumed that to get people to work, you had to make them hungry. New work requirements for Snap food benefits, which went into effect in most of the US on 1 December, are only the latest in a long line of policies based on this idea. The new rules cut off benefits for any non-disabled adult up to age 65 who cannot prove that they are working or seeking work at least 80 hours every month (that includes homeless people, veterans and former foster youth). The Congressional Budget Office estimates that [2.7 million people will lose their benefits](https://civileats.com/2025/11/03/food-insecurity-predicted-to-rise-as-new-snap-work-requirements-take-effect/).

You’ve heard this reasoning before: people are motivated to work because they and their families have to survive. If you give someone welfare – especially food aid – they become dependent and lazy. The Florida-based Foundation for Government Accountability, a conservative thinktank that has been campaigning for years to cut welfare, calls this “ [the dependency trap](https://thefga.org/research/universal-work-requirements/)”. Starving people by taking away their food stamps is supposed to “incentivize individuals to better themselves and transition from dependency to work and self-reliance”.

Ya’akub Vijandre, a Muslim photojournalist, martial arts teacher and first responder who ICE detained in October for posting on social media, told the Guardian that the government is “attacking my faith” and that he was “concerned about the safety” of his family and friends.

Speaking in his first interview from Georgia’s Folkston detention center, the 38-year-old said guards treat detainees “like animals”, yelling at them when they don’t understand English. One guard responded to his request to use the bathroom during a visit to the detention center’s library by telling him, “just piss on yourself”.

On a December day when temperatures dipped below 20 degrees, Street Vendor Project staff walked along a busy commercial street in the Bronx, handing out “know your rights” information to vendors selling fruits and vegetables.

Amir – an asylum seeker who came to the US via Mexico in 2024 – was driving home from his English class in Bloomington, Indiana just after noon on Monday, when he was pulled over by an unmarked police vehicle. Minutes later, the asylum seeker from Afghanistan was cuffed and driven to a detention center.

Good morning.

Indiana Republicans [rejected an effort to redraw the state’s lines](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/11/indiana-republicans-redistricting) on Thursday in a rebuke to Donald Trump and Republican efforts to add two more Republican-friendly seats to Indiana’s congressional districts.

The treasury department [alleged](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sb0332) the vessels “engaged in deceptive and unsafe shipping practices and continue to provide financial resources that fuel Maduro’s corrupt narco-terrorist regime”.

It seems the goalposts are always moving on Shedeur Sanders, the [Cleveland Browns](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cleveland-browns)’ rookie quarterback who keeps throwing people off.

He excelled at _two_ colleges to establish himself as a top NFL prospect, only to wind up getting picked in the fifth round of this year’s NFL draft in one of the most [dramatic stock crashes](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/apr/25/shedeur-sanderss-first-round-nfl-draft) in league history.

Good morning.

US forces have [seized an oil tanker](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/10/us-forces-reportedly-seize-oil-tanker-off-venezuela-coast) off the coast of Venezuela, in a major escalation of Donald Trump’s four-month pressure campaign against the South American country’s dictator, Nicolás Maduro, whose government called the seizure “an act of international piracy”.

**Where is Venezuela’s opposition leader,** **María Corina Machado** **, in all this?** The Nobel peace prize winner [greeted crowds in Oslo](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/11/maria-corina-machado-venezuela-nobel-peace-prize-winner-oslo-norway) after secretly traveling to Norway following 11 months in hiding in Caracas. She said she backs the US oil tanker seizure, calling it a crucial step to tackle what she says is Maduro’s criminal regime.

**Do we know who sent the letters?** It remains unclear – and Lau said she was told it was unlikely police would find out who was behind them.

Hurts committed five turnovers – four interceptions and a lost fumble – in [Monday night’s 22-19 defeat](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/09/eagles-chargers-monday-night-football-nfl) to the Los Angeles Chargers, punctuating one of the ugliest outings of his career. The final mistake, an interception near the goalline in overtime, sealed another deflating loss for an Eagles side that has averaged just 16 points across the past five games. The 8-5 Eagles have not won since 10 November.

      <source:markdown>Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial news, as Evoke decides to undertake a review of the Company’s strategic options

**European stock markets are mostly in the red this morning, as defence company stocks fall.**

Shares in German automotive and arms manufacturer **Rheinmetall** are down 3.3%, UK weapons maker **BAE** **System** has dropped by 1.27%, and Italian defence firm Leonardo has lost 2.2%.

Mainland European equity markets are heading lower in a day that will be dominated by monetary policy out of the Americas.

Notably, the defence sector has particularly suffered this morning, with the likes of BAE Systems, Rheinmetall, and Thales lose traction as the end of the Russia-Ukraine war comes into sight. Unfortunately for Europe, the peace agreement appears to be a deal Trump has formed with Russia behind the back of European leaders whom the President has labelled “weak”.

      <source:markdown>The FDA is reviewing RSV vaccines, which have drastically lowered infant hospitalizations, a spokesperson confirmed

US regulatory officials are re-examining the safety of RSV shots despite no published reports of safety issues – a move that could lead to the removal or limitation of shots that have dramatically lowered hospitalizations among babies.

It’s the latest move from US health officials under Robert F Kennedy Jr, the secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and a longtime anti-vaccine activist, to limit access to shots and to undermine public trust in the safe and effective products.

A senior Democratic senator is calling for an investigation into potential insider trading by fossil-fuel billionaires close to the Trump administration, after a [Guardian investigation raised questions](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/04/venture-global-shares) about an unusual share buying spree.

Robert Pender and Michael Sabel, the [founders and co-chairs of Venture Global](https://ventureglobal.com/about-us/leadership/), a liquefied natural gas (LNG) company headquartered in Virginia, bought more than a million shares worth almost $12m each, just days after meeting with senior Trump officials in March.

      <source:markdown>Zines have made a resurgence as communities seek to share information on everything from ICE raids to local elections

On a cloudy Saturday afternoon, the Los Angeles central public library bustled with nearly 100 people making zines, small, DIY magazines made out of a single piece of paper. There was folding, laughing and helping with cuts. Titles like “Narcan 101,” “Free Palestine,” and “An American Zine,” filled with illustrations and tips, lined a table down the hall.

While this may sound like a scene from the 1980s or 1990s – when zines were popular as a countercultural form of expression – this was a workshop in modern-day Los Angeles, where immigration raids and federal threats have left residents restless and scared.

      <source:markdown>Ukraine’s president to look at holding wartime vote. Plus, the hidden life of Matthew Perry

Good morning.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said he is [ready to hold a wartime election within the next three months](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/09/zelenskyy-ready-for-elections-after-trump-questions-ukrainian-democracy), if Ukraine’s parliament and foreign allies will allow it, after Donald Trump accused him of clinging on to power.

**Why hasn’t there been an election?** Zelenskyy’s five-year term expired in May last year, but the Ukrainian constitution prohibits elections during wartime, and even his political opponents have said repeatedly that the security and political considerations do not allow for holding a vote while the war continued.

**What else did he talk about?** There were familiar rally staples such as a mocking impression of Joe Biden, as well as a repeat of a racist falsehood about the Democratic congresswoman Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, a Muslim woman born in Somalia: “We ought to get her the hell out! She married her brother … Therefore she’s here illegally.” The crowd chanted: “Send her back!” Omar has called the claims about her brother “ridiculous”.

Kamala Harris lost last year’s [US presidential election](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/06/donald-trump-wins-us-presidential-election) because she chased the wrong voters with the wrong message, ultimately demobilising the very base that she needed to win, according to an autopsy by a progressive grassroots advocacy group.

The vice-president focused on courting moderate Republicans over motivating core Democratic working-class, young and progressive voters, a misstep compounded by her failure to break from Joe Biden on Gaza, says the report by [RootsAction](https://rootsaction.org/).

The draw is done. The schedule is set. For the US men’s national team, all that’s left, aside from playing the games, are the emotional highs and lows. After the draw, US head coach Mauricio Pochettino referenced a “competitive stress” factor triggered by the World Cup. He said the friendlies against Belgium and Portugal in March are intended to simulate that stress so that it doesn’t surprise his players when the spotlight of the World Cup arrives.

With the margins always thin at a World Cup, earning results that mitigate that pressure could prove to be the difference between the USMNT crashing out just when they capture the undivided attention of the nation, or enduring and soaring to a best-ever finish.
