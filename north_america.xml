The committee is taking a recess for members to vote on the House floor. A reminder that today we’re expecting a vote on Department of Homeland Security funding bill that dozens of Democrats have vowed to vote against.

Lemonade has launched what it calls “Autonomous Car Insurance”, a first-of-its-kind product that slashes rates by approximately 50% for Tesla owners when Full Self-Driving is engaged.

Donald Trump has said an agreement with Nato on Greenland will give the US full and permanent access to the island, as the defence alliance’s secretary general said its members would have to step up their presence in the Arctic.

Could European countries really decide to boycott the World Cup this summer? It is an astonishing question to be asking in 2026 and an indictment of the bind in which, as Donald Trump sows confusion around a potential annexation of Greenland, the world’s most popular sport finds itself. But the idea is at least seeping into the mainstream and senior figures are asking what, in a worst-case scenario, it would take for football to meet the moment.

Unprecedented times call for previously unthinkable conversations. As the Guardian reported this week, an anniversary party for the Hungarian FA on Monday became the forum for [unofficial discussions among national association heads](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2026/jan/20/concerned-european-football-chiefs-discuss-response-to-donald-trump-over-greenland) about how a unified approach to the US-shaped problem might take shape.

Good morning.

Donald Trump’s announcement of a [“framework of a future deal”](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/22/trump-greenland-framework-future-deal-reactions) regarding Greenland after weeks of intensifying threats of military intervention has been met with deep scepticism from people in the territory, though it was welcomed by European leaders and boosted markets.

**What could a deal involve?** According to media reports, it could result in the US being granted sovereignty over small pockets of Greenland where its military bases are.

**Has Denmark agreed?** That remains unclear – but on Wednesday night Aaja Chemnitz Larsen, a Greenlandic member of the Danish parliament, said the idea that Nato should have any control over Greenland’s sovereignty or minerals was “completely out of the question”.

**What about Trump’s “board of peace”?** At a signing ceremony for the new body in Davos, the US president [claimed](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/22/trump-board-of-peace-launch-davos) the organisation would be “one of the most consequential bodies ever created in the history of the world”.

**What is the family’s situation?** Marc Prokosch, the family’s attorney, said the family had an active asylum case and shared paperwork showing that the father and son arrived to the US at an official crossing point.

**Have other children been detained locally?** Yes. Liam is one of four children in the school district who have been detained by federal immigration agents in the last two weeks, the district said. One is age 10 and two are 17.

      <source:markdown>International coalition of legal groups focuses on political intimidation of lawyers and judges in US – once a role model

The US has been awarded a new dubious distinction: it has been selected as this year’s focus of an international coalition of legal groups and bar associations as a country where lawyers and judges are so politically intimidated that the rule of law is under threat.

The decision to put the spotlight on the US for Thursday’s “ [International Day of the Endangered Lawyer](https://dayoftheendangeredlawyer.eu/)” underlines how rapidly America has plummeted in global esteem. For decades the US has been held up as a role model of a democratic judicial system.

Congressional Democrats are expected to overwhelmingly reject a bill to fund ICE, the agency spearheading Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown, amid mounting outrage over its heavy-handed and violent tactics in Minnesota and elsewhere.

Party leaders told a closed-door meeting on Capitol Hill on Wednesday that they would vote against the homeland security funding bill, citing insufficient provisions to rein in Immigration Customs and Enforcement, more widely known by its acronym.

House Republicans are starting a push on Wednesday to hold **former president Bill Clinton and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton** in contempt of Congress over the **Jeffrey Epstein** investigation, opening the prospect of the House using one of its most powerful punishments against a former president for the first time.

The contempt proceedings are an initial step toward a criminal prosecution by the Department of Justice that, if successful, could send the Clintons to prison.

_They’re not above the law. We’ve issued subpoenas in good faith._

_For five months we’ve worked with them. And time’s up._

New York must redraw its congressional map, a state judge [ruled on Wednesday](https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2026-01-21-Order.pdf), handing Democrats another key opportunity to pick up another US House seat ahead of this fall’s midterm elections.

      <source:markdown>The president’s fixation on ‘piece of ice’ Greenland carries an echo of Vladimir Putin’s claims about Crimea

The good news headline from Donald Trump’s trip to Davos was that he [seemed to rule out force](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2026/jan/21/davos-2026-trump-greenland-rules-out-force-part-north-america) for now in his urgent quest to acquire Greenland. The bad news: he started talking about Iceland as well.

What might have been a big reveal about the next step in Trump’s imperial ambitions was more likely a slip, though all speculation about the workings of the presidential brain is by now a guess at best.

US supreme court justices appeared skeptical of Donald Trump’s case for firing a Federal Reserve governor on Wednesday, in a key test of the president’s power – and his administration’s battle to exert greater control over the US central bank.

Five months after Trump [tried to fire](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/26/who-is-lisa-cook-federal-reserve-governor) Lisa Cook over apparent discrepancies on mortgage applications his officials claim are evidence of fraud, both conservative and liberal justices grilled the administration over whether the US president has the power to fire a Fed governor with seemingly no process.

_Q: Is the US worried that institutional investors in Europe might pull out of the US Treasury market, such as pension funds in Denmark?_

**Bessent** brushes this aside, saying

The size of Denmark’s investment in US Treasury bonds, like Denmark itself, is irrelevant.

It is less than $100 million.

They’ve been selling Treasuries for years. I’m not concerned at all.

      <source:markdown>US president tells business and political leaders in Davos his country needs ownership to defend ‘unsecured island’

Donald Trump has stepped up his demand to annex Greenland but said the US would not use force to seize it during a rambling, invective-laden speech at Davos where he again lashed out at Europe’s political leaders.

Trump gave his speech as they sought to avert a full-scale crisis over Greenland – an effort that appeared successful later as the US president suddenly announced he would delay imposing tariffs on eight European countries from 1 February as negotiations continue.

Theodore Roosevelt, the 26th president, characterized his approach to international relations as “speak softly and carry a big stick”. It was an approach that won him a Nobel peace prize in 1906, for his role in ending the Russo-Japanese war.

      <source:markdown>Reform leader says he agrees ‘strategically’ with Trump but adds that views of Greenlanders must be respected

The world would be a “better, more secure place” if America took over Greenland, Nigel Farage said at Davos, while insisting that he still believed in the sovereignty of nation states.

During a panel at the World Economic Forum’s “America House” in the Swiss ski resort on Wednesday, the Reform UK leader said he had “no doubt” that the world would be safer if a “strong America” was in Greenland “because of the geopolitics of the high north, because of the retreating ice caps and because of the continued expansionism of Russian icebreakers, of Chinese investment”.

Donald Trump has told the Davos economic forum “without us, most countries would not even work”, but for the first time in decades, many western leaders have come to the opposite conclusion: they will function better without the US.

Individually and collectively, they have decided “to live in truth” – [the phrase used by the Czech dissident Vaclav Havel](https://havelcenter.org/2011/12/31/living-in-truth/) and referenced by the Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, in his widely praised speech at Davos on Tuesday. They will no longer pretend the US is a reliable ally, or even that the old western alliance exists.

The California Republican party has asked the US supreme court to block a redistricting measure [voters approved in November](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/04/california-prop-50-voting-result) that would flip up to five House seats in Democrats’ favor.

In an emergency filing, the party asked Justice Elena Kagan, who is assigned to the ninth circuit in a supervisory capacity to oversee emergency filings, to issue an injunction before 9 February, the beginning of California’s candidate filing period for the June 2026 primaries.

Although she was a pivotal figure in the US civil rights movement, Claudette Colvin, who has died aged 86, never received the full recognition she deserved for her courageous and groundbreaking protest against segregation.

On 2 March 1955 Colvin, aged 15, was riding a bus home from school in Montgomery, Alabama, with seats in the front reserved for white passengers, while those in the rear were designated for black people. She was in a “neutral” zone from which, as the bus filled up, the driver could order black passengers to move to the back. When she refused to give up her seat to a white woman, the driver called the police, and Colvin was arrested. Soon afterwards she appeared before a juvenile court. Charges of violating segregation laws and disturbing the peace were eventually dropped on appeal, but her conviction for assaulting a police officer was upheld.

Mayfield appeared to be angered after an Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter posted that Stefanski said Mayfield and another Browns quarterback, Deshaun Watson, had “failed” in Cleveland.

Trump has targeted France [among the eight European countries](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/17/trump-tariff-european-countries-greenland) threatened with tariffs for their opposition to his drive to annex Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark.

Good morning.

Almost 400 millionaires and billionaires from 24 countries are [calling on global leaders to increase taxes on the super-rich](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2026/jan/21/millionaires-billionaires-taxes-super-rich-mark-ruffalo-wef-davos) amid growing concern that the wealthiest in society are buying political influence.

**What did the letter say?** “A handful of global oligarchs with extreme wealth have bought up our democracies; taken over our governments; gagged the freedom of our media; placed a stranglehold on technology and innovation; deepened poverty and social exclusion; and accelerated the breakdown of our planet,” it reads.

**What else is happening at Davos?** Trump has top billing at the conference today and is scheduled to give a special address in the early afternoon (2.30pm local time, or 8.30am EST). He was expected to use this speech to outline his affordability agenda, but given his threats against Greenland his address is now expected to take a more international turn.

Donald Trump has landed in Switzerland for the Davos global gathering as Nato’s secretary general said “thoughtful diplomacy” was the only way to deal with growing transatlantic tensions, remarks that came shortly after the US treasury secretary had dismissed Denmark as an irrelevance.

The US president’s threats to seize Greenland, a largely self-governing part of Denmark, risk tearing the transatlantic alliance apart, while his promise to impose tariffs on European nations who oppose him could trigger a trade war with the EU.

During his first year in the White House, [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump) has pursued a campaign of retribution unlike any other president in US history.

That Trump would pursue such a campaign is not surprising. Since he launched his first run for president in 2015, Trump has channeled the politics of grievance into political success. Returning to the White House after surviving two impeachments and four different criminal cases against him, Trump has used the might of the federal government to punish those he believes have wronged him.

Are the current Europeans different to that generation or have they just had more opportunities? </strong>Europeans have always been quite good. It’s not like Serbia wasn’t always great at basketball but, as the game has grown, the possibilities grow. The world gets smaller with the internet and social media. There’s not as much difference; everyone has access to all the pertinent information. The NBA is more accessible nowadays to people from Europe, Africa and every corner of the world.

That’s true. I didn’t watch much basketball on TV until I started playing at 13, so can relate to coming upon something new and exciting. At the same time, the world’s so small now with social media access. But it is interesting to go to parts of the world where basketball is smaller and see how can we make the game accessible to them.

**Dirk Nowitzki, Tony Parker and John Amaechi were guests at the O2. But every team had a foreign player on opening night this season, with 135 players from 43 countries across the league; up from 7% in 1992 to 24% now. Are the current Europeans different to that generation or have they just had more opportunities?** Europeans have always been quite good. It’s not like Serbia wasn’t always great at basketball but, as the game has grown, the possibilities grow. The world gets smaller with the internet and social media. There’s not as much difference; everyone has access to all the pertinent information. The NBA is more accessible nowadays to people from Europe, Africa and every corner of the world. It’s only natural that more Europeans have success in the NBA.

      <source:markdown>In letter to VA and DHS, Adam Schiff expressed alarm after Guardian reported on memo to gather information

Adam Schiff, a Democratic US senator, is expressing alarm in a letter to the Departments of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Homeland Security (DHS), following a report from the Guardian that revealed the VA was gathering data on its “non-citizen” workforce.

The VA told the Guardian some of the information gathered could be shared with other agencies for immigration enforcement purposes.

But perhaps more interesting than the bike itself is Honda’s decision to use integrated batteries rather than its own in-house removable-battery standard.

**And Davos looks like the place to be this week,** with Trump now declaring that [after his call with Nato’s Rutte](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115925766187001811) he **will have “a meeting of the various parties” on Greenland** – whatever that means and whoever is going to be involved.

Separately, **it’s not clear if [Macron’s offer of setting up a G7 meeting on the sidelines](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115925848634299232) was accepted** (although looking at timings it would risk clashing with the emergency EU summit on Thursday night), but his separate invitation to a dinner at the Élysée Palace might be gone after Trump’s _very_ pointed and personal criticism of the French president.

**Attacked the UK, mockingly calling it a “brilliant” ally, for “shocking” plan to hand over sovereignity of the Chagos islands to Mauritius** (despite previous US support), saying it’s among a “long line” of reasons why Greenland “has to be acquired”

**Leaked private text messages from France’s Emmanuel Macron and Nato’s Mark Rutte** discussing his latest policy moves

**Threatened France with 200% tariffs on French wine and champagne** over Macron’s refusal to join the Gaza “board of peace”, **said of Macron that “nobody wants him because he’s going to be out of office very soon”**

**Reiterated his intention of taking over Greenland** as “imperative for national and world security,” saying “there can be no going back”

**Posted an AI generated visual of himself planting the US flag on Greenland,** saying it’s “US territory, est. 2026,” days after the US delegation agreed with Danish foreign minister for talks to be conducted behind closed doors, and not through threatening messages on social media.

      <source:markdown>- Annex attempt could bring about Uefa-led boycott

- Implications for World Cup alarming heads of FAs


European football leaders are increasingly concerned about Donald Trump’s wish to annex Greenland, and they have held initial discussions about how the sport could respond.

The Guardian understands the implications for the World Cup this summer were among the topics raised among about 20 football association heads in Budapest on Monday. Talks about the Greenland crisis were held informally on the sidelines of an event organised to celebrate the Hungarian football federation’s 125th anniversary, in the knowledge that a unified European response may be required should Trump seek to escalate the situation.

      <source:markdown>Court considering legality of state law banning guns on private property open to the public unless owner allows it

The conservative majority on the US supreme court appeared skeptical of a Hawaii law that bans people from bringing firearms on private property open to the public without permission from the property owner.

The case, [Wolford v Lopez](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5dd86e0364a67a0989dfb915/t/649cae66d93727777ff10ab8/1687989862759/23.06.28+Complaint.pdf), was brought by three Maui residents with concealed-carry permits and a local gun group who have support from Donald Trump’s administration.

“There’s no diplomacy with Donald Trump: he’s a T rex. You mate with him or he devours you.” Debate at the World Economic Forum annual meetings high in the Swiss Alps is usually scrupulously polite, but as this year’s gathering got under way in Davos on Tuesday, California’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, had this blunt advice for handling the week’s star speaker.

The US president was yet to arrive but throughout the blond wood congress centre the hottest topic among the global elite of business and politics – on and off conference stages – was Trump’s intemperate attack on European allies, [threatening punitive tariffs](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/17/trump-tariff-european-countries-greenland) if they fail to let him annex Greenland.

      <source:markdown>The US president uses mass communication to destabilise his rivals, but the risk is that frank exchange may dry up

The words “private and confidential” have never meant a great deal to Donald Trump. In his discussions with other world leaders, he has never operated much of a filter, happy to provide not just the facts of a conversation but also its content and tone, with descriptions all the way from beautiful to nasty.

But it is a new development (barring bits of mildly solicitous correspondence from Volodymyr Zelenskyy last year) for him to simply copy and paste the entirety of private messages on to social media, as he did in the case of Emmanuel Macron’s proposal to set up a G7 meeting in Paris to discuss Greenland, Ukraine and Syria.

      <source:markdown>Rolling coverage of the World Economic Forum in Davos, where European Commission president says Europe must respond to geopolitical shocks

- [Full report: Trump tariffs over Greenland are an error, says Ursula von der Leyen](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/20/trump-tariffs-over-greenland-are-an-error-says-ursula-von-der-leyen)


**Scott Bessent then denies that European Union countries, and the UK, could exercise the “nuclear option” over the Greenland crisis, and dump their holdings of US Treasuries.**

Asked how the Treasury Department, and the White House, would prepare for this, **Bessent** insists it is a “completely false narrative”, and claims the media are “hysterical” over the issue.

I would say this is the same kind of hysteria that we heard on April 2nd. There was a panic.

What I am urging everyone here to do is sit back, take a deep breath, and let things play out.

What president Trump is threatening on Greenland is very different than the other trade deals. So I would urge all countries to stick with their trade deals.

      <source:markdown>Email sent to diplomats by state department office’s new boss is labelled ‘racist’ after dismissing Africa as a priority

US diplomats have been encouraged to “unabashedly and aggressively” remind African governments about the “generosity” of the American people, according to a leaked email sent to staff in the US state department’s Bureau of African Affairs this January and obtained by the Guardian.

“It’s not gauche to remind these countries of the American people’s generosity in containing HIV/Aids or alleviating famine,” says the email.

The Trump administration won a legal victory on Monday that temporarily allows it to keep elected officials out of immigration detention camps, while it advanced two other court actions in support of its surge into Minnesota.

A federal judge in Washington DC ruled that the homeland security department (DHS) can continue to insist that lawmakers provide a week’s notice of their intention to inspect immigration facilities, even though she blocked an identical policy last month.

The Miami Dolphins hired former Packers defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley as their coach on Monday, ending a swift search and tasking him with turning around a franchise that hasn’t won a playoff game in 25 years. Meanwhile, another coaching source is reportedly over with the Tennessee Titans hiring San Francisco 49ers defensive coordinator Robert Saleh.

Hafley replaces Mike McDaniel, [who was fired earlier this month](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2026/jan/08/dolphins-fire-mike-mcdaniel-after-missing-playoffs-for-second-season-in-row) after going 35-33 in four seasons.

- James could still make team as a reserve


The first-ever World team for the NBA All-Star Game already looks loaded. And the fate of LeBron James’ record streak of All-Star selections will now be decided by coaches, or perhaps even Commissioner Adam Silver.

Milwaukee’s Giannis Antetokounmpo, Oklahoma City’s Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Denver’s Nikola Jokić, the Los Angeles Lakers’ Luka Dončić and San Antonio’s Victor Wembanyama were among those announced Monday as starters – an inexact term this year – for next month’s All-Star Game at the Los Angeles Clippers’ home arena in Inglewood, California. They’re likely heading to the World team, which will take on two teams of US players as part of yet another new format for the midseason showcase.

The NBA announced 10 starters, five from each conference. Golden State’s Stephen Curry, New York’s Jalen Brunson, Detroit’s Cade Cunningham, Philadelphia’s Tyrese Maxey and Boston’s Jaylen Brown all are presumably headed to the US squads that will play in the three-team, round-robin tournament on 15 February – all 12-minute mini-games, with the top two teams advancing to a 12-minute championship game.

      <source:markdown>Donald Trump links Greenland seizure threats to Nobel snub in letter to Norway’s prime minister. Plus, unseen home video of Martin Luther King Jr

Good morning.

Donald Trump has linked his repeated threats to seize control of Greenland to his failure to receive the Nobel peace prize, according to [an extraordinary letter](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/19/donald-trump-greenland-threats-nobel-prize-snub-letter) sent to the Norwegian prime minister, Jonas Gahr Støre.

**What else has Trump said about Greenland this weekend?** The US president on Saturday threatened to impose a 10% tariff on imports from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the UK, the Netherlands and Finland from 1 February until the US is allowed to buy the Arctic island.

**How have those countries responded?** The EU is [weighing up retaliatory tariffs](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2026/jan/19/keir-starmer-greenland-tariffs-donald-trump-uk-politics-latest-news-updates) on US goods and even the use of its most severe economic sanctions as European leaders lined up to criticise Trump’s threat, which one minister described as “blackmail”.

**How has the city’s mayor, Jacob Frey, responded?** He said on Sunday that any military deployment would be “ridiculous” and would only exacerbate tensions in Minnesota’s largest city, where the Trump administration has sent 3,000 immigration and border patrol officers who have [faced largely peaceful protests](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/gallery/2026/jan/15/minneapolis-ice-renee-good-protests-in-photos).

A recent survey of more than 3,000 US workers for employment search site [FlexJobs](https://www.flexjobs.com/blog/post/pto-statistics) found that almost a quarter didn’t take a vacation day during the past year and – more concerning to the study’s authors – as many as 82% “avoid using” their accrued time off. Why?

Kelsey Szamet, an employment lawyer, says the reason is a shift in mentality. “Many employees are concerned about the security of their jobs,” she [told Quartz](https://qz.com/us-workers-americans-vacation-time-off?ut). “The adoption of AI and automation technologies has allowed employees to actually consider their own replaceability before requesting a leave or a holiday, or any kind of time-off benefit.”

Several years ago, near Chester, Pennsylvania, Jason Ipock’s aunt was looking to downsize now that she had retired. In her possession was a collection of old family home videos that took up too much room.

Some of the films were in worn-out film canisters, and Ipock worried they’d soon be unplayable. “I decided that I should have the family films digitized, so that we’ll always have a copy in the event of a catastrophe,” he said.

      <source:markdown>If Rudy was a charming underdog story, the Hoosiers’ worst-to-first ascent to college football’s title game on Monday night is the stuff of science fiction

We are living in upside down times. Kim Kardashian [advocates for prison reform](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/05/kim-kardashian-menendez-brothers) as the American government spams out [cartoonish memes](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/03/trump-memes-immigration-deportation) promoting mass deportation and detention. Dave Chappelle – flaws aside – is more trusted to interpret the news than CBS’s Tony Dokoupil. The selection committee behind college football’s playoff somehow put together a compelling tournament without inciting the usual torrent of backlash, and the team raising the trophy at the end could well wind up being _Indiana_. And, no, that’s not a typo.

In case it’s unclear, Indiana is basketballcountry – the birthplace of Larry Bird, the home of the NBA’s Pacers, the inspiration behind Gene Hackman’s Hoosiers. Tier-one campus research, Bobby Knight’s [tempestuous hardwood reign](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/nov/01/bob-knight-basketball-coach-dead-indiana-hoosiers), and Shark Tank’s Mark Cuban are Indiana University’s claims to fame; football rarely, if ever, entered the chat. Before the NFL’s Colts [snuck in](https://www.wishtv.com/sports/indianapolis-colts/march-28-1984-when-the-colts-ditched-baltimore-and-moved-to-indy-overnight/) from Baltimore and blended into Indiana’s sports tapestry, Hoosiers fans spent football season rallying around Notre Dame, a national brand that happens to reside in-state, and saved their true colors for the college basketball tipoff.

A playoff game often pivots on a single moment. The Bears thought they had theirs. Down a score, driving to keep the game alive, the Bears had the ball on the Rams’ 14-yard line. Fourth down. Four yards to pick up a fresh set of downs. A play to keep their season alive. The ball in Caleb Williams’s hands.

      <source:markdown>Trump’s support of Letlow comes after Louisiana senator voted to convict president in second impeachment trial

      <source:markdown>Korey LaVergne, 37, jailed Friday evening on three counts of indecent behavior with a juvenile, according to officials

Authorities in south-west [Louisiana](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/louisiana) recently arrested a Roman Catholic priest on accusations of behaving indecently with a child, igniting a new scandal in the diocese where the US church’s reckoning with clergy abuse began – an institution that just disclosed it could lose up to $162m over pending litigation.

Korey LaVergne was jailed Friday evening on three counts of indecent behavior with a juvenile, according to Acadia parish sheriff KP Gibson, whose agency arrested the priest. LaVergne had presided over mass at St Edward church in Richard – where the Lafayette diocese had assigned him as pastor – hours before he was booked into the Acadia lockup.

Donald Trump is borrowing a strategy from authoritarian regimes to intimidate potential critics and discourage them from speaking out, according to a senator under investigation by his administration.

Elissa Slotkin, a Democrat from Michigan, faces questioning after she organised and appeared in a video with other Democrats imploring military service members to refuse “illegal orders”.

      <source:markdown>Classrooms have emptied, shops have shut, and the mood is tense – but as the federal operation has ramped up, so has residents’ response

      <source:markdown>Congressional Republicans criticize ‘absurd’ idea as polls show most Americans oppose taking control of territory

Donald Trump’s renewed interest in taking control of Greenland has become a subject of pointed dissent among congressional Republicans, with several allies speaking out in recent days against the idea after the president reintensified his interest following the US raid that captured Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro.

Congressional Republicans are typically loath to disagree openly with the president, who has repeatedly called for his party’s dissenters to be voted out of office. But amid [polling](https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/15/politics/greenland-cnn-poll) that shows an overwhelming majority of Americans oppose taking control of the island and warnings from Denmark that an invasion would spell the end of Nato, some congressional Republicans have issued forceful warnings against pursuing the issue.

A Florida congressional candidate says he bought the online domain [nazis.us](http://nazis.us) and set it up to redirect visitors to the US Department of Homeland Security, under whom federal agents have been carrying out brutal immigration crackdowns at the behest of the Trump administration.

Mark Davis, who is running for Republican Vern Buchanan’s US House seat in November’s midterms, took responsibility for the ploy in a Friday X post – as polling showed most Americans believe the killing of Minneapolis woman Renee Nicole Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent demonstrated problems with the way ICE has been operating.

Beginning his question during the White House press briefing, Niall Stanage, a White House columnist for the Hill, referred to the Trump administration’s staunch defense of ICE agents and the assertion by the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, that ICE are “doing everything correctly”.

A federal judge on Thursday cleared the way for a New York offshore wind project to resume construction, a victory for the developer who said a Trump administration order to pause it would probably kill the project in a matter of days.

District judge Carl J Nichols, an appointee of Donald Trump, ruled construction on the Empire Wind project could go forward while he considers the merits of the government’s order to suspend the project. He faulted the government for not responding to key points in Empire Wind’s court filings, including the contention that the administration violated proper procedure.

The justice department is undertaking an unprecedented effort to collect sensitive voter information about tens of millions of Americans, a push that relies on thin legal reasoning and which could be aimed at sowing doubt about the midterm election results this year.

The department has asked at least 43 states for their comprehensive information on voters, including the last four digits of their social security numbers, full dates of birth and addresses, [according to the Brennan Center for Justice](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/tracker-justice-department-requests-voter-information). Eight states have voluntarily turned over the information, according to the Brennan Center, and the department has sued 23 states and the District of Columbia for the information.

One day during his first term, Donald Trump summoned a top aide to discuss a new idea. “Trump called me down to the Oval Office,” John Bolton, national security adviser in 2018, told the Guardian. “He said a prominent businessman had just suggested the US buy Greenland.”

It was an extraordinary proposal. And it originated from a longtime friend of the president who would go on to acquire business interests in the Danish territory.

David Stern used to tell a joke. In his early years as NBA commissioner, he liked to say, his job was essentially to travel back and forth between Boston and Los Angeles to hand out the championship trophy. In the first five NBA Finals after he took the helm in early 1984, the Celtics and Lakers won all five titles, each missing the decisive series just once.

Current commissioner Adam Silver recalled the anecdote last June, ahead of the 2025 NBA Finals, by which time the league was guaranteed a seventh different champion in seven years. “We set out to create a system that allowed for more competition around the league,” Silver [said then](https://apnews.com/article/nba-finals-adam-silver-cd1d47349e0b3964645532f5e04ceb4e) in his annual news conference. “The goal being to have 30 teams all in the position, if well managed, to compete for championships.

      <source:markdown>The Trump administration indefinitely suspended immigrant visa processing from 75 countries – see which nations have been affected

- Full story: [Trump administration halts visa processing from 75 countries](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/14/immigrant-visas-suspended-trump)


The Trump administration has [indefinitely suspended](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/14/immigrant-visas-suspended-trump) immigrant visa processing for people from 75 countries, marking one of its most expansive efforts yet to restrict legal pathways to the United States.

The freeze, which takes effect on 21 January, targets applicants officials deem likely to become a “public charge” – people who they believe may rely on government benefits for basic needs.

The [US supreme court](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-supreme-court) on Wednesday revived a lawsuit by a Republican congressman in Illinois that challenges a state law allowing mail-in ballots to be counted if they are received after election day.

Bost argued that the Illinois law allowing ballots to be counted up to two weeks after election day if they are postmarked by the deadline unconstitutionally allows an extension of the election period.

In a reversal from previous years’ pollution reductions, the United States spewed 2.4% more heat-trapping gases from the burning of fossil fuels in 2025 than in the year before, researchers calculated in a study released on Tuesday.

The increase in greenhouse gas emissions is attributable to a combination of a cool winter, the explosive growth of datacenters and cryptocurrency mining, and higher natural gas prices, according to the Rhodium Group, an independent research firm. Environmental policy rollbacks by Donald Trump’s administration were not significant factors in the increase because they were only put in place this year, the study authors said.

On a cool Wednesday afternoon before the US Open last year, Daniil Medvedev and Alexander Zverev were busy fine-tuning their games in an intense practice set at Louis Armstrong Stadium. Danielle Collins and Christian Harrison, semi-finalists in the mixed doubles tournament, were scheduled to take their place at the hour and the American pair duly arrived a couple of minutes before their allotted slot.

An amusing scene soon unfolded. Medvedev and Zverev were clearly desperate to continue playing for a little longer, but their court time had run out. The pair began to sheepishly deliberate over whether to attempt to play another game, even lining up on the baseline again, and they still occupied the court past the hour. Finally, they admitted defeat, allowing Collins and Harrison, who had been standing quietly on the sidelines, to begin.

A wave of federal prosecutors in Minnesota and Washington DC have resigned in protest over the justice department’s decision not to hold a civil rights investigation into the fatal shooting of an unarmed US citizen by a federal immigration agent in Minneapolis.

[Polling showed](https://progressmichigan.org/2025/12/new-poll-majority-of-michiganders-opposed-to-controversial-data-centers/) just 28% of residents supported new datacenters, and, amid the furor, Dylan Wegela, a Michigan state congressman, [introduced a bill](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/16122025/michigan-lawmakers-introduce-bill-to-repeal-data-center-tax-incentives/) to repeal datacenter tax credits.

The average American is losing hundreds of dollars each year on subscriptions they forget to cancel or struggle to end, even as federal consumer protections meant to address the problem remain blocked by a federal court ruling.

With the regulatory route stalled, two representatives are offering a bipartisan fix: California Democrat Mark Takano and Nevada Republican Mark Amodei are reintroducing the Unsubscribe Act Tuesday morning that would prohibit deliberately complex cancellation processes.

Less than a year after Donald Trump returned to power, and his administration oversaw the firing and resignation of thousands of FDA employees, a [listeria outbreak](https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/12/health/listeria-food-safety-wellness) that killed six people and sickened 27 across 18 states due to contamination of prepared pasta meals underlined the danger posed by safety failings.

        <![CDATA[<p>Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly has sued the Pentagon over attempts to punish him for his warnings about illegal orders. He's claiming the Trump administration trampled on his constitutional rights to free speech. Kelly, a former Navy pilot who represents Arizona, is seeking to block his censure from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth last week. Hegseth said he censured Kelly over his participation in a video that called on troops to resist unlawful orders. A federal judge scheduled a hearing Thursday on Kelly's request for a temporary restraining order against the Pentagon.</p>

      <source:markdown>Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly has sued the Pentagon over attempts to punish him for his warnings about illegal orders. He&#39;s claiming the Trump administration trampled on his constitutional rights to free speech. Kelly, a former Navy pilot who represents Arizona, is seeking to block his censure from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth last week. Hegseth said he censured Kelly over his participation in a video that called on troops to resist unlawful orders. A federal judge scheduled a hearing Thursday on Kelly&#39;s request for a temporary restraining order against the Pentagon.

In response to the news overnight that Donald Trump’s justice department has launched a criminal investigation into Federal Reserve chair **Jerome Powell**, the Senate banking committee’s top Democrat – **Elizabeth Warren** – has warned that her colleagues should not move forward with the president’s nominee for the role when Powell’s term expires at in May of this year.

Warren accused the president of wanting to “install another sock puppet to complete his corrupt takeover of America’s central bank”.

Trump is abusing the authorities of the Department of Justice like a wannabe dictator so the Fed serves his interests, along with his billionaire friends.

This Committee and the Senate should not move forward with any Trump nominee for the Fed, including Fed Chair.

      <source:markdown>On Jan. 7, 2025, the Eaton and Palisades Fires began, killing 31 people and destroying around 13,00 homes in the Los Angeles area. A year later, residents are looking to rebuild the lives and homes they once had.

Marketplace’s David Branccacio and his wife lost their Altadena home to the Eaton fire, and have yet to break ground on a new building. But as they continue to plan for construction in the new year, they are focusing on fire-resistance for the future.

Branccacio joined “Marketplace Tech” host Meghan McCarty Carino to speak about the technology and building that goes into fire-resistant homes.</source:markdown>

Most nights for the last year, Darlene Hamilton slept four hours and woke at about 4.30am. She wanted to sleep, but she could not.

Instead the 66-year-old started the day at her Altadena rental home in morning darkness with a familiar routine, scouring through websites of local humane societies and lost animal groups in search of two familiar little faces. For a year, her days often began and ended with this ritual.

The biggest surprise of [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump)’s first year back in office is how quickly America’s institutions capitulated to “the bully”, said [Michael Steele](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/06/michael-steele-donald-trump-republican-party-interview), a former chair of the Republican National Committee (RNC) turned arch critic.

But with the midterm elections for Congress looming, Steele predicts a resounding Democratic victory amid a hunger among voters to hold the president and his allies accountable for threatening democracy.

A few days before Christmas in Pérez Zeledón, a city in Costa Rica, Greidy Mata stared at two photographs of her late brother.

In the second, he was lying in a hospital bed in a vegetative state, after being deported back home.

Dinner was served, but Mata seemed indifferent. She kept switching between one photograph and the other until she suddenly recounted that a year ago, in what would become the last family reunion, Gamboa announced he would be leaving for New Jersey.

It is a world turned upside down. In his first year in office, [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump) has bullied [Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine), bombed [Iran](https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran) and [toppled the leader of Venezuela](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/03/trump-venezuela-oil-industry). In the eyes of critics, he has turned the US into a rogue superpower that poses a greater threat to [Nato](https://www.theguardian.com/world/nato) allies than its foes.

The blitzkrieg has left diplomats in foreign capitals scrambling to understand Trump’s motivations and what – or who – is shaping his thinking. Like past presidents, he has an inner circle of advisers who are playing a crucial role in determining his worldview.

Pacing inside the Kremlin last weekend, as news feeds churned out minute-by-minute reports of Donald’s Trump’s Venezuelan coup, Vladimir Putin may have been wondering [what it would mean for the price of oil](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/05/russia-weighs-up-fall-of-nicolas-maduro-venezuela).

Crude oil has lubricated the Russian economy for decades – far more than gas exports to Europe – and so the threat of falling oil prices, prompted by US plans for control of Venezuela’s rigs, will have been a source of concern.

A federal judge ruled on Friday that the [Trump administration](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration) cannot block federal money for childcare subsidies and other programs aimed at supporting low-income families with children from flowing to five Democratic-led states for now.

The states of California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota and New York argued that a policy announced on Tuesday to freeze billions of dollars in funds for three grant programs was having an immediate impact on them and creating “operational chaos”.

More than a year after a devastating [wildfire](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california-wildfires) tore through Pacific Palisades, all but obliterating one of the west coast’s most iconic neighborhoods, prosecutors are honing their case against the man they say is responsible.

Jonathan Rinderknecht, a 29-year-old occasional Uber driver who used to live in Pacific Palisades, was charged with three felonies by federal prosecutors in October, who claim he was in the neighborhood in the early hours of New Year’s Day. According to [a federal complaint](https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/10/palisades-fire-criminal-complaint.pdf), Rinderknecht allegedly used an open flame – likely a lighter – to start a small blaze that grew to about 8 acres (3.2 hectares) before firefighters rushed to the area and extinguished it.

State and local leaders say they do not believe that the FBI investigation of the shooting death of Renee Nicole Good will be fair and impartial, and are sounding alarms about the impact of federal officials holding onto evidence in a potential prosecution of the ICE agent who killed her.

Minnesota’s lead investigative agency, the bureau of criminal apprehension, initially began investigating the shooting in conjunction with the FBI. But the BCA issued a statement Thursday morning saying that “the US attorney’s office had reversed course: the investigation would now be led solely by the FBI, and the BCA would no longer have access to the case materials, scene evidence or investigative interviews necessary to complete a thorough and independent investigation”.

More than a thousand protests are planned across the US this Saturday and Sunday after ICE agents shot three people, one fatally, in Minneapolis and Portland, Oregon, this week.

“This weekend, people all over are coming together not just to mourn the lives lost to ICE violence, but to confront a pattern of harm that has torn families apart and terrorized our communities,” said Leah Greenberg, co-executive director of Indivisible, an organizer of “ICE Out for Good Weekend of Action”.

      <source:markdown>Blocking immigration will not make Trump’s America great again – for the US to shine, he must let it get browner

Here’s one reason Donald Trump seems perennially in a bad mood: he has probably figured out that the America [he fantasizes about](https://www.instagram.com/p/DNl0KP8p7j7/) is out of his reach.

However many immigrants he manages to deport or prevent from entering the country, the white paradise he is promising his Maga base, free of Somalis, Mexican “rapists” and generally people from “shithole countries” – closer in hue to the America where he was born – is not his to offer.

- Suspension applies if free agent signs in 2026

- Veteran outfielder spent last season with Phillies


Free agent outfielder Max Kepler has been suspended for 80 games after testing positive for a banned performance-enhancing substance, Major League Baseball announced on Friday, a ruling that sidelines the veteran as he looks for his next club.

The suspension stems from a positive test for epitrenbolone, a metabolite of the prohibited steroid trenbolone prohibited under MLB’s Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment Program. The ban takes effect immediately and would apply if Kepler signs with a team during the 2026 season.

Tesla has launched a new “Standard” Model Y Long Range in Europe and a non-long range version in Canada, bringing another more affordable version of its best-selling electric SUV to these markets.

The simultaneous launch in the two markets separated by an ocean is due to Model Y vehicles in Canada actually coming from Europe.

Tesla’s trim name-scheming is starting to get a bit complicated.

The White House said Venezuela would be “turning over” the nearly $3bn (£2.3bn) of crude stranded in tankers and storage facilities before it is sold on the international market and after that the US plans to [control all the country’s oil sales “indefinitely”](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2026/jan/07/oil-prices-fall-after-trump-says-venezuela-will-send-up-to-50m-barrels-to-us).

      <source:markdown>![](https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2026/01/Tesla-Optimus-xAI.png?w=1600)

In a move that completely undermines the “Tesla is an AI company” narrative, Elon Musk’s private startup, xAI, has reportedly told investors that it plans to build the AI to power Tesla’s Optimus robot.

This new development comes from a [Bloomberg report](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-09/musk-s-xai-reports-higher-quarterly-loss-plans-to-power-optimus) detailing xAI’s widening losses and massive cash burn. According to the report, xAI executives explicitly told investors that their goal is to “develop self-sufficient AI to power robots like Tesla’s Optimus.”

This is a massive shift in the narrative and potentially the smoking gun in ongoing shareholder lawsuits regarding Musk’s breach of fiduciary duty.

Then there was the fear and tension over the president’s history of attacking and suing [news organizations over unfavorable coverage](https://firstamendmentwatch.org/tag/trump-suing-for-defamation/). Meanwhile, audience [trust in media](https://news.gallup.com/poll/651977/americans-trust-media-remains-trend-low.aspx) was at an all-time low.

While it was a turbulent time for traditional media, it opened a window for independent journalists like Marisa Kabas, who is not beholden to covering Trump’s every move, nor saddled with decades of institutional distrust. On 27 January, she received a massive scoop she published in her newsletter, [the Handbasket](https://www.thehandbasket.co/p/omb-memo-freeze-federal-grants-scoop): the US office of management and budget was freezing federal grants.

Good morning.

US federal agents [shot two people outside a hospital in Portland](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/08/portland-federal-agents-shooting) a day after an ICE officer fatally shot a woman in Minneapolis.

**What** **do local officials** **say?** Portland’s mayor, Keith Wilson said: “We know what the federal government says happened here. There was a time when we could take them at their word. That time is long past.” He called for ICE to pause operations in Portland until the investigation was complete.

**How are Democrats reacting to the shooting of Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis?** Some are threatening to [use the next funding deadline](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/08/democrats-homeland-security-renee-nicole-good) to forcibly restrain ICE.

**The Guardian has debunked** the false [claims about Good’s killing here.](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/09/white-house-minneapolis-ice-killing)

**What did he say about Venezuela?** When [asked how long](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/09/morality-military-might-and-a-sense-of-mischief-key-takeaways-from-trumps-new-york-times-interview) he would be “running Venezuela”, Trump said for “much longer” than a year.

**What about Greenland?** It “may be a choice” between obtaining Greenland or preserving the Nato alliance, he said.

      <source:markdown>X, formerly Twitter, is facing a global backlash because users are directing the platform&#39;s AI chatbot, Grok, to generate non-consensual intimate imagery. Users have been popping up in the replies of women — and sometimes minors — tagging Grok and asking it to generate images of them in bikinis or undressed.

The company and its owner, Elon Musk, have both clarified illegal content will not be tolerated on the platform.

Plus, President Donald Trump signed an executive order late last year aimed at blocking states from enforcing local AI regulations — something a majority have adopted in some form.

And, Meta is a victim of its own success. Its new Ray-Ban smart glasses are selling too fast to keep up with demand.

Marketplace’s Meghan McCarty Carino spoke with Maria Curi, tech policy reporter at Axios, to discuss all these topics on this week’s Marketplace Tech Bytes: Week in Review.</source:markdown>

The killing of a US citizen by a federal immigration agent in [Minneapolis](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/minneapolis) was a five-alarm fire for the [Trump administration](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration). But a torrent of untruths, half-truths, smears and innuendo has been unleashed by the White House, and amplified by its social media and cable television acolytes, in an attempt to douse the flames.

Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic House minority leader, called the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, a “stone cold liar” on Thursday for her efforts to falsely portray the victim, [Renee Nicole Good](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/08/minnesota-ice-shooting-nicole-macklin-good), a 37-year-old mother of three and award-winning poet, as a “domestic terrorist”.

Analysis by the shipping intelligence publication [Lloyd’s List](https://www.lloydslist.com/) suggests that of those, at least 17 suspicious vessels joined the Russian registry over the past month, compared with 15 ships in the previous five months of 2025.

We are barely a week into 2026, and we are already seeing a significant shift in the narrative regarding Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) timeline. After missing yet another high-profile deadline to achieve unsupervised autonomy by the “end of the year” in 2025, Elon Musk has now dropped a new metric that explains a lot — and raises even more questions.

In a new comment today, Musk has stated that Tesla needs to accumulate roughly **10 billion miles** of data to achieve “safe unsupervised self-driving.”

UnitedHealth has refused to hand over key internal records to lawmakers investigating the company’s [efforts to reduce hospital transfers](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/dec/17/unitedhealth-nursing-homes) for nursing home residents, according to a 7 January letter sent to the company by the US senators Ron Wyden and Elizabeth Warren.

The veteran lawmakers, both members of the powerful Senate finance committee, launched their inquiry last summer following a [Guardian investigation](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/21/unitedhealth-nursing-homes-payments-hospital-transfers) into bonuses that UnitedHealth pays to nursing homes that reduce hospital transfers for their residents. Those are hospitalizations the insurance giant would otherwise have to pay for.

UnitedHealth did not directly respond to questions from the Guardian about the senators’ assertion that the company had failed to turn over internal documents. But it said in a statement that it will “continue to engage” with the senators and that its nursing home care program “improves outcomes” and “reduces unnecessary hospitalizations”.

The US president has since renewed his call for the US to seize Greenland, a Danish territory – a move that would threaten European security and could mean the end of Nato

      <source:markdown>Experts decry move to leave UNFCCC as ‘embarrassing’ as president orders withdrawal from 66 international groups

Donald Trump has sparked outrage by announcing the US will exit the foundational international agreement to address the climate crisis, cementing the US’s utter isolation from the global effort to confront dangerously escalating temperatures.

In [a presidential memorandum](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2026/01/withdrawing-the-united-states-from-international-organizations-conventions-and-treaties-that-are-contrary-to-the-interests-of-the-united-states/) issued on Wednesday, Trump withdrew from the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), along with 65 other organizations, agencies and commissions, calling them “contrary to the interests of the United States”.

By 1934, it was entirely evident what Benito Mussolini was up to. Italy’s dictator had already consolidated power, colonized Libya and annexed the city of Rijeka. He nevertheless got to stage the second-ever World Cup, [managing it with a heavy hand](https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/apr/01/world-cup-moments-1938-italy-benito-mussolini) and even supplanting the Jules Rimet trophy with a far larger one. Hosting and winning that World Cup didn’t sate his expansionist appetites. By the end of the decade, Mussolini would take Ethiopia, annex Albania and back Francisco Franco in the Spanish civil war.

It was equally well established in 1978 in Argentina that General Jorge Rafaél Videla’s military junta, which had taken over two years earlier, was maintaining its grip on power through [systematic detention, torture and murder](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/17/jorge-rafael-videla). Still, protestations from other nations were ignored and the World Cup kicked off.

_Leander Schaerlaeckens’ book on the United States men’s national soccer team, The Long Game, is out on May 12. You can [preorder it here](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/722130/the-long-game-by-leander-schaerlaeckens/). He teaches at Marist University._

Donald Trump plans to use Venezuela’s vast crude reserves to establish control of most of the western hemisphere’s oil in an attempt to drive the market price down to about $50 (£37) a barrel, according to reports.

The US president has repeatedly raised the prospect of producing enough crude from Venezuela’s oilfields to drive down the US oil price from more than $56 a barrel today to about $50 in an effort to cut energy costs for consumers, according to the Wall Street Journal, which cited senior Trump administration officials.

      <source:markdown>City targeted by Trump has seen swarm of immigration agents on the streets – and residents say the tension is palpable

Edwin Torres DeSantiago received a text message on Wednesday morning as he was tracking immigration enforcement across Minneapolis – a person was shot by ICE at 34th Street and Portland Avenue.

He jumped into his car to head to the scene. Torres DeSantiago manages the Immigrant Defense Network, a group that monitors ICE activity and responds to community needs after someone is taken. He has responded to dozens of scenes in the past few months, and even more in the last few days since the federal government surged its presence in the midwestern city.

- [Explainer: why so much interest in a rusty tanker in the Atlantic?](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/07/marinera-seized-tanker-atlantic-us-uk-russia)


Meanwhile, in the UK, **Nigel Farage has offered his take on Trump’s plans to control Greenland, saying it would be “outrageous” for the US to seize it from Denmark.**

      <source:markdown>Administration has alleged fraud in decision to halt grants from California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota and New York

Donald [Trump’s administration](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration) said Tuesday that it is withholding funding for programs that support needy families with children in five Democratic-led states over concerns about fraud.

The US Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the program, will require the states to provide extra documentation to access the funds.

The child care and development fund subsidizes day care for low-income households, enabling parents to work or go to school.

Temporary assistance for needy families provides cash assistance and job training so parents in poverty can afford diapers and clothes and earn paychecks.

The social services block grant, a much smaller fund, supports several different social service programs.

Good morning.

Donald Trump and his advisers are looking at “a range of options” in [an effort to acquire Greenland](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/06/trump-greenland-control-us-military), noting in a White House statement on Tuesday that using the US military to do so is “always an option”.

**How are the US’s European allies responding?** In a show of solidarity on Tuesday, the leaders of France, Germany, the UK and other countries issued a joint statement with the prime minister of Denmark, Mette Frederiksen, urging the US to respect its sovereignty. They said Arctic security was a top priority for Nato, a defense alliance that includes the US and Greenland. “Greenland belongs to its people,” the statement said.

**What would a deal of this kind signify?** Top Venezuelan officials have called Maduro’s capture a kidnapping and accused the US of trying to steal the country’s vast oil reserves. However, Tuesday’s agreement is a strong sign that the government is responding to Trump’s demand that it [open up](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2026/jan/06/trump-us-taxpayers-oil-firms-venezuela-investment) to US oil companies or risk more military intervention.

The bombshell announcement that the Trump administration no longer fully recommends [a third of childhood vaccines](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2026/jan/05/trump-rfk-jr-child-vaccine-recommendations) means the US moved from leading globally on vaccination to lagging behind other high-income nations in preventing disease, experts say.

The move is the latest and most significant escalation against vaccines from Robert F Kennedy Jr, a longtime vaccine skeptic and current secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

When the US was confirmed as a future World Cup co-host on the eve of the 2018 tournament in Russia, the USMNT were still stuck under the rubble of their shocking failure to qualify. Mauricio Pochettino was just establishing himself among European club soccer’s managerial elite, taking Tottenham to the Champions League final a year later.

Few could have imagined that he’d be leading the USMNT into the 2026 World Cup, and perhaps fewer believe he’ll stick around for the next cycle.

      <source:markdown>Speaker says Trump not looking to take control militarily as Democrats say briefing raises more questions than answers

The surprise incursion came after months of mounting US pressure on Venezuela, which has included [a blockade](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/16/trump-orders-blockade-oil-tankers-venezuela) of some oil shipments and [airstrikes on vessels](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/01/us-coast-guard-search-survivors-boat-strike-pacific-ocean) off its shores that have killed at least 110 people.

The theory sounds straightforward. Venezuela [has vast oil reserves](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2026/jan/04/venezuela-oil-industry-bust-what-role-could-the-us-play) and used to produce more than three times as much volume as it does now.

That, roughly speaking, is the only clear part of Donald Trump’s plan for what happens next in Venezuela. “We’re going to have our very large US oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure – the oil infrastructure – and start making money for the country,” he said at the weekend.

Five Stanford University students are facing trial beginning on Monday over felony charges stemming from a pro-Palestinian protest on campus – the most severe criminal case brought against some of the thousands of students who staged nationwide protests and encampments against Israel’s war in Gaza.

The northern California students are part of a group of 12 who were charged with felony conspiracy to trespass and felony vandalism in connection to an hour-long, June 2024 occupation during which the group barricaded themselves inside the university president’s office to demand Stanford consider a student resolution to divest from Israel, among other requests.

In some ways, these refineries are a relic of another time; built to process the heavy, unctuous crude imported from Latin America before the boom in lighter US shale oil emerged earlier this century.

A UK minister would not be drawn into saying whether his government believes the US capture of Venezuela’s president was influenced by **the country’s rich oil reserves**.

_**This is for Donald Trump to answer**, and I think he has said in his press conference, which I watched with interest around narco-terrorism and that threat._

Discontent at Manchester United these days is only ever deferred. Ruben Amorim’s [departure from the club](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2026/jan/05/ruben-amorim-sacked-by-manchester-united-transfers-power-struggle) on Monday was long anticipated and came, in the end, with a weary sigh.

And so another manager, the seventh since Sir Alex Ferguson left in 2013, falls victim to the United meat-grinder.

Everybody at United, fundamentally, is unhappy. And not unhappy in the sense that Alex Ferguson used to be unhappy, when the club was essentially fuelled by his volcanic rages, but enervated, frustrated by the realisation that this is not how things used to be, that this was once the biggest football club in the country and now they keep failing to get the win they need to lift them to fifth.

In the tiny seaside village of Pacific Grove, California, there’s no escaping the monarch butterfly.

Here, butterfly murals abound: one splashes across the side of a hotel, another adorns a school. As for local businesses, there’s the Monarch Pub, the Butterfly Grove Inn, even Monarch Knitting (a local yarn shop). And every fall, the small city hosts a butterfly parade, where local elementary school children dress up in butterfly costumes. The city’s municipal code even declares it an unlawful act to “molest or interfere” with monarchs in any way, with a possible fine of $1,000.

Thedeposed Venezuelan president, [Nicolás Maduro](https://www.theguardian.com/world/nicolas-maduro?page=2), is expected to appear in Manhattan federal court on Monday afternoon on drugs and weapons charges after his extraordinary [capture](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/03/explosions-reported-venezuela-caracas) by US special forces this weekend.

Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were seized in a shocking pre-dawn raid at a compound on Saturday during an [assault on Caracas](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/03/venezuela-attack-what-we-know-so-far-as-trump-claims-maduro-captured).

When Americans go to cast ballots in the midterm elections in 2026, much of the attention is likely to be on races for the US House, Senate and governorships – contests that will serve as a referendum on [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump)’s first two years in office and determine the trajectories of the final ones.

But further down the ballot, voters will choose secretaries of state in key races that could have a major effect on how elections are run in many US states, including several battleground states that are key to the 2028 presidential race. Twenty-six states are set to choose secretaries of state next year, including the presidential battlegrounds of Nevada, Arizona and Michigan.

      <source:markdown>John Harbaugh has spent nearly two decades leading Baltimore. But his failure to get the most out of his quarterback is a fireable failing

There are losses, and then there are those defeats that show us exactly who a team are. [The Steelers’ 26-24 win over the Ravens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbgNNw0SJ3o) on Sunday night was the latter. It wasn’t just a loss; it was a referendum. The game was vintage, grubby, beautiful AFC North football. A rivalry game with a playoff place on the line. Big plays. Dumb decisions. Cris Collinsworth making unintelligible noises on commentary. In the final three minutes, four plays swung the win probability by more than 40 percentage points.

The Steelers, missing DK Metcalf and Darnell Washington, scored on four of their five second-half drives, three of them touchdowns, with Aaron Rodgers finding Calvin Austin for a 26-yard score with 55 seconds left. Baltimore, by contrast, couldn’t get out of their own way until Lamar Jackson strapped on his cape, completing seven of his final nine passes, throwing two touchdowns and converting [a ridiculously clutch fourth-down strike](https://x.com/All_22_NFL_Cuts/status/2008026031148683394) to Isaiah Likely with 21 seconds left and the season on the line.

Good morning.

Nicolás Maduro, the deposed Venezuelan president, is [expected to appear in Manhattan federal court on Monday afternoon](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/05/nicolas-maduro-venezuela-new-york-court) on drugs and weapons charges after US special forces seized him in a shocking raid at the weekend.

Donald Trump and his defense secretary [Pete Hegseth](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pete-hegseth) are mounting an aggressive push to politicise the top ranks of the US military – a push that smacks of Stalinism and could take years to repair, the former infantry chief who trained troops to [invade Iraq](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/17/iraq-war-invasion-2003-aftermath-middle-east-islamic-state) has warned.

Maj Gen Paul Eaton has sounded the alarm, saying in an interview with the Guardian that the effort to bend the higher echelons of the military to the US president’s will was unparalleled in recent history and could have long-term dire consequences. He warned that both the reputation and efficiency of the world’s most powerful fighting force was in the balance.

The first year of his second term was marked by crackdowns on [climate](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-crisis) science that produced world-class weather forecasts and the gutting of frontline federal agencies - policies that have left the country, already struggling to keep pace with severe storms, even more at risk.

Deep in the heart of Los Angeles’s Koreatown, just a few doors down from H Mart and a K-pop music superstore, an American flag hangs over the entrance of a saloon called Eastwood.

The western-themed bar would normally be cranking Luke Bryan while customers play skee-ball, line dance and get bucked off their mechanical bull named Gucci. But tonight, the music is low and the loudest sounds come from the clacking of vintage mechanical typewriters. About 30 people in the bar are drafting poems about horses, sunsets and Stetson hats – which are plentiful atop the heads in the crowd.

      <source:markdown>Trump’s audacious arrest of Maduro marks a conspicuous break with convention, even as previously observed by the president himself

Nothing speaks more eloquently of the disempowering of the US Congress under Donald Trump’s second presidency than the brazenly audacious detention of Venezuela’s leader, Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia.

      <source:markdown>Donald Trump says US will ‘run’ Venezuela as Nicolás Maduro and wife Cilia Flores are flown to New York

The US president, Donald Trump, has said the US will ‘run’ Venezuela after its president, Nicolás Maduro, and his wife, Cilia Flores, were captured and taken to New York, hours after a “large-scale” pre-dawn assault on Caracas and the surrounding region. Here is what we know so far:

Donald Trump said **“We’re going to run the country**\[Venezuela\] until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition” during a press conference about the attack on Venezuela. He has not given details.

**A plane carrying Maduro and Flores landed in New York on Saturday evening** and they were expected to be transported to appear in Manhattan federal court, possibly as soon as Monday.

**The** **US is going to be “very strongly involved” in Venezuela’s oil industry after the military operation** **, Trump** **said.** He said: “We have the greatest oil companies in the world, the biggest, the greatest, and we’re going to be very much involved in it.”

**Trump posted a photograph of Maduro on his Truth Social platform.** It appeared to show the captured Venezuelan president in handcuffs, wrap-around sun goggles and headphones.

**The** **UN security council** is [due to hold](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2026/jan/03/caracas-explosions-venezuela-maduro-latest-news-updates-live?page=with%3Ablock-69597e098f083c44d70df0a0#block-69597e098f083c44d70df0a0) an emergency meeting on Monday.

Trump said his administration **had not spoken to Venezuela’s exiled opposition leader** **María Corina Machado**. He said he did not think she would be able to return to lead Venezuela, saying: “She does not have the support in Venezuela. She is a very nice woman but she does not have the support.”

The constitutional chamber of Venezuela’s supreme court has ordered **vice president Delcy Rodríguez** to assume the role of acting president in Maduro’s absence.

**Trump was asked about Cuba** during the press conference on Venezuela. He said “Cuba, as you know, is not doing very well right now. That system has not been a very good one for Cuba. The people there have suffered for many, many years and I think Cuba is going to be something we’ll end up talking about, because Cuba is a failing nation right now.”

The **US Department of Justice released a new indictment** against Nicolás Maduro, including his wife, Celia Flores, his son and others.

**The US vice-president, JD Vance, hailed what he called a “truly impressive operation”** **.** Resharing Trump’s post about the action, Vance [wrote](https://x.com/JDVance/status/2007447083909841398): “The president offered multiple off-ramps, but was very clear throughout this process: the drug trafficking must stop, and the stolen oil must be returned to the United States.”

**In a statement on X, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said Maduro** **was “under indictment for pushing drugs in the United States”.** The Republican senator Mike Lee said on Saturday that Rubio had told him he “anticipates no further action in Venezuela now that Maduro is in US custody”.

The **UN secretary general, António Guterres, is deeply alarmed by US military action in Venezuela**, his spokesperson has said, and considered the US intervention “a dangerous precedent”.

The US bombardment of Venezuela and the capture of its president, Nicolás Maduro, follow a long history of interventions in South and Central America and the Caribbean over the past two centuries. But they also mark an unprecedented moment as the first direct US military attack on a South American country.

At a press conference after Maduro’s capture, Donald Trump said that “American dominance in the western hemisphere will never be questioned again”.

Star speed skater Jordan Stolz shockingly stumbled to the ice right after the start of the men’s 1,000 meters at the US Olympic trials for long track speed skating on Saturday but still finished with the third-fastest time and will head to the Milan Cortina Winter Games.

Stolz caught the toe of one of his skates on the slick surface, lost his footing and tripped after fewer than five strides at the Pettit National Ice Center, about 40 miles south of his hometown of Kewaskum. It was the sort of thing that simply doesn’t happen to the best in the world at what he does – someone expected to earn multiple medals and to be one of the faces of the 6-22 February Olympics.

Over the course of two decades, [Jeffrey Epstein](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein) repeatedly appeared on law enforcement’s radar for sexual misconduct involving teen girls and young women.

Zohran Mamdani vowed to “reinvent” New York City in a speech on his first day as mayor, promising “a new era” for America’s largest city and an ambitious start to his term of office.

The 34-year-old political star and democratic socialist, who a year ago was a virtually unknown state assemblyman, is the city’s first Muslim mayor, the first of south Asian descent and the first to be born in Africa. He is also the first to be sworn in using the Qur’an.

      <source:markdown>Blaze that swept through crowded New Year’s Eve bar in Crans-Montana also injured 115 people. Plus, the politicians and advocates making climate policy part of the affordability agenda

Good morning.

Swiss investigators are [racing to identify the victims of a fire](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/01/switzerland-to-hold-five-days-of-mourning-after-dozens-killed-in-resort-fire) that tore through a crowded bar, killing about 40 people and injuring 115 who were celebrating at a New Year’s Eve party in the Alpine ski resort of Crans-Montana.

**How did the fire start?** The fire broke out at 1.30am on Thursday in the town’s Le Constellation bar, but it’s not yet clear what set off the blaze. Some witnesses said it started after sparklers or flares were put into champagne bottles.

**How long will it take to identify the dead?** Swiss police have warned it could take days or even weeks, leaving an agonising wait for family and friends.

**What else did he say?** Mamdani did not shy away from his socialist politics. “I was elected as a democratic socialist and I will govern as a democratic socialist. I will not abandon my principles for fear of being called radical,” he said to loud cheers from the gathered crowd. He ended by saying: “The work has only just begun.”

      <source:markdown>Complaint argues Trump administration denying coverage of gender-affirming care is sex-based discrimination

The Trump administration is facing a legal complaint from a group of government employees affected by a new policy going into effect Thursday that eliminates coverage for gender-affirming care in federal health insurance programs.

The complaint, filed Thursday on the employees’ behalf by the Human Rights Campaign, is in response to an August announcement from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) that it would no longer cover “chemical and surgical modification of an individual’s sex traits through medical interventions” in health insurance programs for federal employees and US Postal Service workers.

      <source:markdown>As the Trump administration derides climate policy as a ‘scam’, emissions-cutting measures are gaining popularity

A group of progressive politicians and advocates are reframing emissions-cutting measures as a form of economic populism as the [Trump administration](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration) derides climate policy as a “scam” and fails to deliver on promises to tame energy costs and inflation.

Climate politics were once cast as a test of moral resolve, calling on Americans to accept higher costs to avert environmental catastrophe, but that ignores how rising temperatures themselves drive up costs for working people, said Stevie O’Hanlon, co-founder of the youth-led Sunrise Movement.

      <source:markdown>Democratic socialist mayor led historic push to lead New York, speaking on immigration, Trump and subway burritos

[Zohran Mamdani](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/zohran-mamdani), the democratic socialist who is now mayor of [New York City](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york), ran a campaign known for its soaring political rhetoric, its [viral memes](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/20/zohran-mamdani-social-media-viral-videos) and its candidate’s witty quips.

Here are some of the quotes that came to define his [historic](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/06/zohran-mamdani-campaign-new-york-democrats) [push](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/23/zohran-mamdani-new-york-city-mayor-race-viral) to lead one of the world’s most important cities:

New York will remain a city of immigrants: a city built by immigrants, powered by immigrants, and, as of tonight, led by an immigrant. So hear me, President Trump, when I say this: to get to any of us, you will have to get through all of us.

What I don’t have in experience, I make up for in integrity. And what you don’t have in integrity, you could never make up for with experience.

No more will New York be a city where you can traffic in Islamophobia and win an election.

It’s pronounced ‘cyclist’.

I am young, despite my best efforts to grow older. I am Muslim. I am a democratic socialist. And most damning of all, I refuse to apologize for any of this.

I don’t think that we should have billionaires because, frankly, it is so much money in a moment of such inequality, and ultimately, what we need more of is equality across our city and across our state and across our country.

I hear you. I see you. And if you’re a burrito on the Q train, I eat you.

If anyone can show a nation betrayed by Donald Trump how to defeat him, it is the city that gave rise to him. So, if there is any way to terrify a despot, it is by dismantling the very conditions that allowed him to accumulate power. This is not only how we stop Trump, it’s how we stop the next one. So, Donald Trump, since I know you’re watching, I have four words for you: turn the volume up!

Zohran Mamdani was sworn into office as New York’s 111th mayor at the stroke of midnight, the first Muslim mayor as well as the first to take office as a Democrat bearing the credentials of a democratic socialist.

The 34-year-old was sworn in by Letitia James, the state attorney general, in a disused subway station beneath city hall that acts as turnaround for the local 5 train, to be followed by a first-of-its-kind public block party along Broadway’s “Canyon of Heroes”.

Donald Trump’s new [national security strategy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-National-Security-Strategy.pdf) offers a misguided assessment of Europe, long regarded as the US’s most reliable ally.
