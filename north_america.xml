WH Smith will try to take back as much as £7m in bonuses from former executives after revealing the UK’s financial watchdog has launched a formal investigation into a devastating accounting error linked to its US business.

Almost £600m was [wiped off the books to paperclips retailer’s stock market value](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/21/wh-smith-cuts-profit-forecasts-after-30m-accounting-error) overnight in August after it identified errors with accounting for supplier income and provision for lost stock going back to 2023 in its North American arm.

      <source:markdown>US president has been blatant in his appointment of relatives, close friends and big donors – almost none of whom have diplomatic experience

When your goal is to “help Europe correct its current trajectory” because it is “weak”, “decaying” and facing “civilisational erasure”, your choice of highly trained operatives for the mission is plainly of paramount importance.

In Donald Trump’s case they include: a former burger magnate; his eldest son’s former fiancee; the owner of the Houston Rockets basketball team; a producer of Broadway musicals; PayPal’s co-founder; and a convicted felon who is also his son-in-law’s father.

After the assassination of Charlie Kirk in September, Donald Trump and others pledged a no-holds barred crackdown on leftwing activists.

“We have radical left lunatics out there and we just have to beat the hell out of them,” Trump said after Kirk’s shooting. Top White House officials, including JD Vance and Stephen Miller, repeatedly publicly vowed that a crackdown was coming. In particular, the [government focused](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/designating-antifa-as-a-domestic-terrorist-organization/) on “Antifa.” short for antifascist, is not an organization but rather an ideology that broadly describes a variety of left-leaning beliefs.

US prices rose 2.7% in the year to November, according to federal data released a day after [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump) claimed they were falling “very fast” on his watch.

The latest consumer price index, released on Wednesday morning, was down from 3% in September, and short of economists’ expectations of about 3.1% for last month.

In the past, a fan’s ability to attend a World Cup hosted in their nation hinged more on bid books than their checkbooks. For 2026 in the US, Mexico and Canada, even the least expensive tickets are a luxury commodity by comparison.

An analysis by the Guardian of men’s World Cup ticket pricing shows that amid the general rise in ticket prices for the 2026 World Cup, the most extreme of those hikes have often applied to the cheapest tickets. The analysis is based on official Fifa pricing dating back to 1994, with more robust data available starting in 2006. Prices for 2026 games are accurate as of 16 December 2025, and do not include the [1.6% of sellable tickets](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/dec/16/fifa-world-cup-pricing-tier-supporters-entry) for each game that Fifa recently made available for a fixed $60 price.

      <source:markdown>Experts decry Jason Reding Quiñones’s ‘fishing expedition’ as subpoenas reportedly issued to John Brennan and others

A Maga loyalist US attorney in Miami is expanding an investigation of ex-FBI and intelligence officials who incurred Donald’s Trump’s wrath with an inquiry into how Russia helped him win in 2016, despite the US justice department suffering stinging recent court rejections of indictments of two foes of the US president.

Former prosecutors and legal experts call the Miami-based inquiry, which has issued some two dozen subpoenas so far, a “fishing expedition”. The investigation’s apparent focus is to identify ways to criminally charge ex-FBI and intelligence officials who have already been investigated and effectively exonerated by two special counsels and a Republican-led Senate panel, which mounted exhaustive inquiries into Russia’s efforts to boost Trump in 2016.

Warner Bros Discovery is poised to tell shareholders to reject Paramount’s $108bn (£81bn) hostile bid, according to reports, clearing the way for Netflix to proceed with its buyout of the Hollywood film and TV group.

Good morning.

Donald Trump is [suing the BBC for $10bn over its editing of a speech](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/15/trump-bbc-lawsuit) he made to supporters before the storming of the US Capitol in 2021.

**On what basis is Trump suing?** He’s seeking $5bn in damages on each of two counts: alleging that the BBC defamed him, and that it violated Florida’s Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act.

**What roadblocks remain to a deal?** The main one is the future of the Ukrainian territories occupied by Russia.

**What’s Donald Trump’s view on this?** He’s appeared to suggest that to receive security guarantees, Ukraine must cede the parts of the eastern Donbas region that it still holds to Russia – something Volodymyr Zelenskyy has previously rejected.

This is a developing story. [Follow the latest in our live blog.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/dec/16/ukraine-peace-talks-russia-europe-us-trump-latest-news-updates)

Precisely 85 years ago, one of the most fearsome heavyweight boxers in history stunk out the joint. Joe Louis was in the midst of his “Bum of the Month club”: a staggering run of 13 world title defences in 29 months against an assortment of stiffs, wild men and colourful characters. And when he arrived in Boston on 16 December 1940, most believed that Al McCoy would rapidly become his next victim. Only it didn’t quite turn out that way.

“McCoy was expected to crumple under the first punch Louis tossed in his direction,” the New York Times’ correspondent wrote. “Instead, the wily New England veteran made Louis appear ludicrous at times. Adopting a crouching, bobbing, weaving style, McCoy was an elusive target for the paralysing fists of the titleholder.” After the messy contest was stopped at the end of the fifth, a storm of jeers rang out.

      <source:markdown>FBI director said his agency helped detain ‘person of interest’ in Brown shooting – who was released hours later

Kash Patel, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigations, is once again facing criticism for rushing to social media to tout his agency’s work on tracking down a person of interest in a shooting prematurely.

After a shooter killed two and injured nine at Brown University on Saturday, Patel, a lawyer and rightwing commentator before his job in the administration, [posted on X](https://x.com/FBIDirectorKash/status/2000244040667676940) that his agency had helped detain a “person of interest in a hotel room” in Coventry, Rhode Island, acting off a lead from the Providence police.

      <source:markdown>Danny Ceisler’s defeat in sheriff’s race of incumbent who had signed an agreement to work with ICE sends a message on US’s contentious debate around immigration policy

Only 40 miles north of Philadelphia, Bucks county has gained a reputation as the “swingiest” county in the swing state of Pennsylvania and one of the most pivotal political bellwethers in the country.

Party registration in the county is [almost evenly split](https://www.buckscounty.gov/186/Voter-Statistics) among Democrats and Republicans. Joe Biden won it in 2020, Donald Trump triumphed there in 2024. November’s elections there were local – but a hot race for county sheriff drew much wider attention as a microcosm for America’s contentious debate around immigration policy – and the result signaled a shake-up in how the county approaches enforcement.

The Trump administration’s proposed cuts in federal funding for law enforcement and public health agencies could have a devastating impact on Alaska, [which a Guardian analysis found](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/oct/17/overdose-deaths-data-analysis) has struggled to curtail overdose deaths even amid a general decline in national overdose fatalities.

Law enforcement and public health experts are sounding the alarm as the Trump administration has prioritized waging its “war on drugs” outside US shores, including with a controversial bombing campaign of fishing boats off the coast of Venezuela.

That’s been true for probably 40 years, since they lurched into financial crisis amid boardroom shenanigans in the 1980s, becoming the first soccer club to list on the stock exchange and embarking on a disastrous programme of diversification (the highlight perhaps being becoming Hummel’s distributor in the UK, a role they performed so badly that Southampton took a page of their own programme to blame Spurs for the fact that their shirts were not being delivered).</p><p>Right now, Spurs would probably settle for even a little bit of a fix, a slow hint of progress, a flicker of hope, anything to break them out of the current grim spiral.

Sunday’s defeat <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague/table">leaves them 11th</a>, 14 points behind Arsenal. Given that Spurs finished 17th last season, perhaps that is not so unexpected – and the compacted nature of the table means they are only four points off fifth and probable Champions League qualification.

That’s been true for probably 40 years, since they lurched into financial crisis amid boardroom shenanigans in the 1980s, becoming the first soccer club to list on the stock exchange and embarking on a disastrous programme of diversification (the highlight perhaps being becoming Hummel’s distributor in the UK, a role they performed so badly that Southampton took a page of their own programme to blame Spurs for the fact that their shirts were not being delivered).

Right now, Spurs would probably settle for even a little bit of a fix, a slow hint of progress, a flicker of hope, anything to break them out of the current grim spiral. They have won just one of their last seven league games. When they beat Everton on 26 October, they were third, five points behind the leaders. Sunday’s defeat [leaves them 11th](https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague/table), 14 points behind Arsenal. Given that Spurs finished 17th last season, perhaps that is not so unexpected – and the compacted nature of the table means they are only four points off fifth and probable Champions League qualification. But, equally, 22 points represents their lowest Premier League tally after 16 games since 2008.

      <source:markdown>A person who was taken into custody after two people were killed and several more critically injured was later released

Two people have been killed and several more critically injured in a shooting at Brown University, in Providence, Rhode Island. Here’s what we know so far:

**A person in their 20s was taken into custody on Sunday morning, but then released later in the day**. Police chief Col Oscar Perez declined to say whether the person of interest was the same person seen in surveillance footage released by authorities on Saturday. Officials did not name the person. **The person was later released without charge as the authorities said the evidence took the investigation in “a different direction”.**

**A shooter dressed in black [killed at least two people and wounded nine others at Brown University](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/13/brown-university-shooting) during final exams** on the Ivy League campus.

**Brown University president Christina Paxson confirmed that the two people killed were students**. A shelter-in-place in effect for the area was lifted on Sunday morning.

**Eight people with gunshot wounds were taken to Rhode Island hospital**, where seven were in critical but stable condition, Paxson said on Sunday. One person remains in a critical condition, she added. One other student was discharged from hospital on Saturday night and left with their parents, Paxson said.

**Providence’s mayor Brett Smiley said he had visited the victims of the attack in hospital,** praising their resilience and the efforts of emergency medical staff who treated them.

**The two slain have been [identified](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/15/brown-university-shooting-victims) by loved ones as** **Ella Cook** **, a second-year Brown student from Alabama, and** **MukhammadAziz Umurzokov** **, an Uzbek national in his first year of studies at the Ivy League institution.** Cook was vice-president of Brown’s chapter of College Republicans of America, and Umurzokov had dreams of becoming a neurosurgeon, those who knew them have said.

**The university [announced](https://president.brown.edu/president/parents-and-families-campus-operations-after-yesterdays-tragedy) that all remaining classes, exams, papers and projects were cancelled for the rest of the semester.**

**Officials refused to say whether a gun used in the attack had been found.** A small Glock handgun with a laser sight attached and a revolver were found in a hotel room where the person of interest was apprehended, federal law enforcement sources have told CNN.

**Law enforcement agencies were seen at a Hampton Inn hotel in Coventry, Rhode Island, roping off rooms as part of the investigation into the shooting.** An FBI agent said the person of interest had been arrested at the hotel, which is a short drive from Brown University.

**The FBI used cellphone data to locate the person of interest, the agency’s director Kash Patel said.**

**Donald Trump paid tribute to the victims in the attack.** Speaking at the White House, the US president said: “I want to just pay my respects to the people, unfortunately two are no longer with us, Brown University, nine injured and two are looking down on us right now from Heaven.” The president added: “So to the nine injured: get well fast. And to the families of those two that are no longer with us: I pay my deepest regards and respects, from the United States of America. Thank you very much. It’s a very important thing to say, and we mean it.”

**The shooting occurred in the Barus and Holley building, a seven-story complex that houses the School of Engineering and physics department**.

The Heritage Foundation, an influential rightwing thinktank [currently mired in controversy](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/nov/20/nick-fuentes-tucker-carlson) over its president’s apparent apology for extremism, has appointed as a director the founder of a secretive all-male network of Christian nationalist fraternal lodges.

Scott Yenor, appointed as [Heritage’s new director of the B Kenneth Simon Center for American Studies](https://www.heritage.org/staff/scott-yenor-phd), has also recently offered ultra-conservative opinions on women, marriage and LGBTQ+ rights in recent podcast appearances and speaking engagements.

A person of interest detained after a mass shooting at Brown University that killed two students and injured nine has been released after the investigation took law enforcement authorities in a “different direction”, officials said Sunday night.

The disclosure was made at a hastily convened [late night news conference](https://www.youtube.com/live/p2LyhsA-IAc?si=wZ3SUaSYyINkZ7jb&#38;t=908) to address the killings that have rattled the Ivy League campus. It came more than 12 hours after officials had announced that they had taken a person into custody. The Rhode Island attorney general, Peter Neronha, said authorities had since concluded there is “no basis to consider him a person of interest.”

The release leaves law enforcement without any publicly disclosed suspect, with officials pledging to redouble efforts in the investigation by canvassing for video surveillance that could help pinpoint the killer’s identity.

      <source:markdown>In at least half a dozen states, librarians have joined forces with civil rights groups to oppose book bans, often facing personal and professional repercussions

For decades, libraries served as a safe haven for many queer and marginalized youths in eastern Texas, says former county library director Rhea Young. Unlike the school cafeteria, the library was a space where they could explore and find acceptance in who they wanted to be.

“There were books where they can find characters like them, and realize it’s okay to be who they are,” Young said. “There needs to be more places like that, not fewer.”

Farm worker Owen Salmon has picked apples in upstate New York for almost a decade, some 1,500 miles (2,400km) from home. In the midst of harvest season this year, [Hurricane Melissa](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/28/hurricane-melissa-makes-landfall-in-jamaica), a record-breaking category 5 hurricane, made landfall in Jamaica.

“It was terrifying,” said Salmon, whose wife and two children were at home near Black River, a town on the country’s south-western coast. “For days, I couldn’t hear from them. When I finally did, I heard my roof was completely gone. My wife and kids had to run for their lives, but thank God they’re alive.”

[Universal basic income](https://www.theguardian.com/society/universal-basic-income) (UBI) is back, like a space zombie in a sci-fi movie, resurrected from policy oblivion, hungry for policymakers’ attention: brains!

Andrew Yang, whose “Yang Gang” enthusiasm briefly shook up the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020 promoting a “Freedom Dividend” to save workers from automation – $1,000 a month for every American adult – is again the main carrier of the bug: offering UBI to save the nation when robots eat all our jobs.

Before the street outside her mother’s home filled with gunfire, before panicked partygoers sprinted through the front yard, before she discovered that the body on the ground was a young man she had watched grow up, Khlilia Daniels knew something in Bogalusa had to change.

It was December of 2022, and Daniels had spent the year watching her home town on Louisiana’s border with Mississippi become a steadily more frightening place. Murders, once rare, now seemed to be happening almost every month, shootings every other week, and in a city of just over 10,000 people, that violence felt close, the losses personal.

Good morning.

The alleged gunmen behind the [Bondi beach terror attack are a father and son](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/dec/15/bondi-beach-terror-attack-father-son-duo-alleged-behind-shooting-licensed-firearms-ntwnfb) suspected of using legally obtained firearms to commit the massacre, according to police.

**Were either known to the authorities?** Naveed Akram was examined by security agencies in October 2019 because of his alleged associations with others, said the prime minister, Anthony Albanese. [He said](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/dec/14/bondi-beach-shooting-live-updates-victims-terror-attack-jewish-festival-hanukah?filterKeyEvents=false&#38;page=with%3Ablock-693fcaaf8f08ff9b9e8574e0#block-693fcaaf8f08ff9b9e8574e0) the alleged shooters were not thought to be “part of a wider \[terrorist\] cell”.

**Are gun laws being discussed?** Yes, the New South Wales premier, Chris Minns, said there would “almost certainly” be changes to gun laws, and police were investigating whether there had been a failure of their systems in relation to how licensed weapons could have been used in a terror attack.

This is a developing story: [follow the latest updates on our liveblog](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/dec/14/bondi-beach-shooting-live-updates-victims-terror-attack-jewish-festival-hanukah?page=with%3Ablock-693fcaaf8f08ff9b9e8574e0#block-693fcaaf8f08ff9b9e8574e0).

**What have the police said?** The LAPD’s chief detective, Alan Hamilton, said the investigation was ongoing. “At this time, the LAPD is not seeking anyone as a suspect or as a person of interest … and we will not be doing that until we conduct our investigation and we move forward.”

With subsidies for Affordable Care Act (ACA) health insurance set to expire, Americans who rely on them will probably switch to plans with lower monthly premiums and high deductibles or decide not to purchase any coverage, which will have a serious and damaging impact on the entire sector, according to healthcare policy experts.

Founded by Jimmy Glenn, a former boxer turned trainer, in 1971, Jimmy’s Corner has stood, defiantly unchanged, as Times Square has boomed around it.

The neighborhood bar, a New York City institution which attracts locals and tourists alike, has had the same pictures on the walls for decades – some of the bar’s regulars have been coming almost as long – kept the same furniture, and maintained remarkably low pricing. In a perhaps unintentional nod to its history, there is also several years’ accumulation of dust in some areas.

The Rural Health Transformation Fund is a carveout that will provide $50bn over a period of five years to states [who meet certain application criteria](https://www.cms.gov/priorities/rural-health-transformation-rht-program/overview), including “consumer-facing, technology-driven solutions for the prevention and management of chronic diseases,” and “providing training and technical assistance for the development and adoption of technology-enabled solutions that improve care delivery in rural hospitals, including remote monitoring, robotics, artificial intelligence, and other advanced technologies”.

Minnesota sent center Marco Rossi, defenseman Zeev Buium, winger Liam Ohgren and a first-round pick in the 2026 draft to suddenly rebuilding Vancouver to complete the deal.

At 41, Lindsey Vonn is no longer defying expectations so much as resetting them. One day after becoming [the oldest woman to win a World Cup race](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/12/lindsey-vonn-comeback-world-cup-ski-victory-aged-41), the American came within a quarter-second of doing it again, finishing second in Saturday’s downhill at St Moritz behind Germany’s Emma Aicher.

Less than 24 hours after rewriting the World Cup age record, Vonn briefly looked on course for another victory as she surged ahead of Italy’s Sofia Goggia on the sunlit Corviglia course. But Aicher, skiing immediately after her, attacked the increasingly rutted track and edged Vonn by 0.24 seconds to deny her a rare opening-weekend double.

      <source:markdown>The US’s national security strategy, shared last week, claims European immigration will cause ‘civilisational erasure’

How do you create a foreign policy manifesto for a US president who leads from the gut?

The initial draft fell to Michael Anton, a Maga firebrand whom officials have called the lead author behind the US’s radical new national security strategy (NSS). The document shocked US allies, warning that immigration to Europe would cause “ [civilizational erasure](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/05/civilisational-erasure-us-strategy-document-appears-to-echo-far-right-conspiracy-theories-about-europe)”, reviving the Monroe doctrine in the western hemisphere, and downgrading the US’s responsibility for great power competition with China and Russia.

Two more senior Democrats have called for an investigation into a share-buying spree by two fossil fuel billionaires with close ties to the Trump administration, after a [Guardian investigation raised](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/04/venture-global-shares) questions about potential wrongdoing.

Robert Pender and Michael Sabel, the [founders and co-chairs of Venture Global](https://ventureglobal.com/about-us/leadership/), a liquefied natural gas (LNG) company headquartered in Virginia, bought more than a million shares worth almost $12m each in March.

      <source:markdown>Burrowing owls, who boarded cruise ship in Miami, to be returned to US next month after long spell in quarantine

Two burrowing owls stowed away on a cruise ship out of Miami, and are now living the high life at a Spanish resort before returning to the US next month.

Biologists from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) said the mating pair boarded Royal Caribbean’s Allure of the Seas before the vessel’s transatlantic crossing to Cartagena in southern Spain in February. The tiny owls, a threatened species in Florida, usually prefer more rural landscapes, and may have been spooked by all the concrete around the Port of Miami, they say.

Since mid-May, when Major League Baseball commissioner Rob Manfred announced Pete Rose [would be eligible for Hall of Fame consideration](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/may/15/pete-rose-hall-of-fame-baseball) and [explained his specious reasonings behind it](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jun/05/mlb-commissioner-manfred-admits-he-paid-attention-to-trump-when-overturning-pete-rose-ban), last week’s Hall of Fame vote by the 16-member Classic Era committee carried with it a certain air of inevitability for Roger Clemens and Barry Bonds, the two greatest players currently not enshrined in Cooperstown.

Rose was championed by Donald Trump, who used his populism to demand the Hit King finally be allowed into the Hall, an honor denied Rose since 1989 when baseball placed him on the permanently ineligible list for betting on games when he managed the Cincinnati Reds. After Rose [died in September 2024](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/sep/30/pete-rose-dies-mlb-baseball), Trump then won the presidency five weeks later and immediately increased the pressure on Manfred to end Rose’s 36-year banishment – despite the absence of any evidence suggesting Rose was any less guilty in death of gambling on the sport than he had been alive.

The Indiana legislature’s [rejection](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/11/indiana-republicans-redistricting) of a new map that would have added two Republican seats in Congress marked one of the biggest political defeats for [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump) so far in his second term and significantly damaged the Republican effort to reconfigure congressional districts ahead of next year’s midterm elections.

The defeat showed that Trump’s political might is not unlimited.

      <source:markdown>Five years after legalizing psilocybin to treat a raft of health problems, practitioners worry the industry has become too costly, too white, and too regulated. Can the landmark program find its footing?

Jenna Kluwe remembers all the beautiful moments she saw in a converted dental clinic in east Portland.

For six months, she managed the Journey Service Center, a “psilocybin service center” where adults 21 and older take supervised mushroom trips.

Minutes later, the asylum seeker from Afghanistan was cuffed and driven to a detention center.

Good morning.

Indiana Republicans [rejected an effort to redraw the state’s lines](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/11/indiana-republicans-redistricting) on Thursday in a rebuke to Donald Trump and Republican efforts to add two more Republican-friendly seats to Indiana’s congressional districts.

The lawmakers, led by Illinois congresswoman Delia Ramirez – along with congressman Mark Takano of California and US senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, the top Democrats on the House and Senate veterans affairs committees – have written a group letter to be sent to the VA secretary, Doug Collins, and the secretary of homeland security, Kristi Noem, on Friday.

The treasury department [alleged](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sb0332) the vessels “engaged in deceptive and unsafe shipping practices and continue to provide financial resources that fuel Maduro’s corrupt narco-terrorist regime”.

Good morning.

US forces have [seized an oil tanker](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/10/us-forces-reportedly-seize-oil-tanker-off-venezuela-coast) off the coast of Venezuela, in a major escalation of Donald Trump’s four-month pressure campaign against the South American country’s dictator, Nicolás Maduro, whose government called the seizure “an act of international piracy”.

**Where is Venezuela’s opposition leader,** **María Corina Machado** **, in all this?** The Nobel peace prize winner [greeted crowds in Oslo](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/11/maria-corina-machado-venezuela-nobel-peace-prize-winner-oslo-norway) after secretly traveling to Norway following 11 months in hiding in Caracas. She said she backs the US oil tanker seizure, calling it a crucial step to tackle what she says is Maduro’s criminal regime.

**Do we know who sent the letters?** It remains unclear – and Lau said she was told it was unlikely police would find out who was behind them.

      <source:markdown>The 2026 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) carries $8bn more than the funding Trump requested in May

The US House has approved a sweeping defence bill that bolsters Europe’s security, in what appears to be sharp rebuke to Donald Trump’s mounting threats to downgrade Washington’s ties to traditional allies and Nato.

The bipartisan vote came just days after the publication of a [White House national security strategy](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/05/civilisational-erasure-us-strategy-document-appears-to-echo-far-right-conspiracy-theories-about-europe) that said Europe faced “civilisational erasure” and made explicit Washington’s support for Europe’s nationalist far-right parties – rattling EU leaders and opening up a seismic shift in transatlantic relations.

**House speaker Mike Johnson said today that he has yet to see the video of the [boat strike](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/02/trump-venezuela-boat-lethal-strike)** that has been the subject of intense scrutiny and accusations of war crimes.

- Rivers last played in NFL in 2020


The Indianapolis Colts have not ruled out starting Philip Rivers at quarterback after luring the grandfather out of retirement amid an injury crisis.

The Colts lost starter Daniel Jones for the season after he tore his achilles on Sunday, while their first-round pick in 2023, Anthony Richardson, is out with a broken orbital bone he suffered in October.

The US Federal Reserve announced on Wednesday that it was cutting interest rates by a quarter point for the third time this year, as the embattled central bank appeared split over how best to manage the US economy.

The Fed chair, Jerome Powell, has emphasized unity within the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the board of Fed leaders that sets interest rates. But the nine-to-three vote to lower rates to a range of 3.5% to 3.75%was divisive among the committee that tends to vote in unanimity.

With little more than a week to go until the Christmas recess, the Commons is in festive overdrive. Demob happy. A few minutes in to the year’s penultimate prime minister’s questions with MPs from both sides shouting and cheering, the speaker interrupted proceedings to say: “We don’t need the panto auditions any more.” To which the natural response was: “Ooh yes we do.” Because that’s pretty much the whole purpose of PMQs at the best of times. A feelgood experience for some. A feelbad experience for others. Noise with no substance.

No one embraces the panto spirit more than Kemi Badenoch. Kemi has come to realise that the bar is actually quite low for her to remain as Tory leader.

- ‘If the ice isn’t ready, we’re not going,’ NHL deputy warns


The NHL says it is “disappointing” that the main ice hockey venue for the Winter Olympics will not be ready until the new year – and warned that its top players will not show up unless the ice is shown to be safe.

The men’s and women’s tournaments are expected to be among the highlights of the 2026 Milan-Cortina Games with the NHL stars showing up for the first time since 2014.

      <source:markdown>Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial news, as Evoke decides to undertake a review of the Company’s strategic options

**European stock markets are mostly in the red this morning, as defence company stocks fall.**

Shares in German automotive and arms manufacturer **Rheinmetall** are down 3.3%, UK weapons maker **BAE** **System** has dropped by 1.27%, and Italian defence firm Leonardo has lost 2.2%.

Mainland European equity markets are heading lower in a day that will be dominated by monetary policy out of the Americas.

Notably, the defence sector has particularly suffered this morning, with the likes of BAE Systems, Rheinmetall, and Thales lose traction as the end of the Russia-Ukraine war comes into sight. Unfortunately for Europe, the peace agreement appears to be a deal Trump has formed with Russia behind the back of European leaders whom the President has labelled “weak”.

A senior Democratic senator is calling for an investigation into potential insider trading by fossil-fuel billionaires close to the Trump administration, after a [Guardian investigation raised questions](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/dec/04/venture-global-shares) about an unusual share buying spree.

Robert Pender and Michael Sabel, the [founders and co-chairs of Venture Global](https://ventureglobal.com/about-us/leadership/), a liquefied natural gas (LNG) company headquartered in Virginia, bought more than a million shares worth almost $12m each, just days after meeting with senior Trump officials in March.

      <source:markdown>Zines have made a resurgence as communities seek to share information on everything from ICE raids to local elections

On a cloudy Saturday afternoon, the Los Angeles central public library bustled with nearly 100 people making zines, small, DIY magazines made out of a single piece of paper. There was folding, laughing and helping with cuts. Titles like “Narcan 101,” “Free Palestine,” and “An American Zine,” filled with illustrations and tips, lined a table down the hall.

While this may sound like a scene from the 1980s or 1990s – when zines were popular as a countercultural form of expression – this was a workshop in modern-day Los Angeles, where immigration raids and federal threats have left residents restless and scared.

      <source:markdown>Ukraine’s president to look at holding wartime vote. Plus, the hidden life of Matthew Perry

Good morning.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said he is [ready to hold a wartime election within the next three months](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/09/zelenskyy-ready-for-elections-after-trump-questions-ukrainian-democracy), if Ukraine’s parliament and foreign allies will allow it, after Donald Trump accused him of clinging on to power.

**Why hasn’t there been an election?** Zelenskyy’s five-year term expired in May last year, but the Ukrainian constitution prohibits elections during wartime, and even his political opponents have said repeatedly that the security and political considerations do not allow for holding a vote while the war continued.

**What else did he talk about?** There were familiar rally staples such as a mocking impression of Joe Biden, as well as a repeat of a racist falsehood about the Democratic congresswoman Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, a Muslim woman born in Somalia: “We ought to get her the hell out! She married her brother … Therefore she’s here illegally.” The crowd chanted: “Send her back!” Omar has called the claims about her brother “ridiculous”.

Kamala Harris lost last year’s [US presidential election](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/06/donald-trump-wins-us-presidential-election) because she chased the wrong voters with the wrong message, ultimately demobilising the very base that she needed to win, according to an autopsy by a progressive grassroots advocacy group.

The vice-president focused on courting moderate Republicans over motivating core Democratic working-class, young and progressive voters, a misstep compounded by her failure to break from Joe Biden on Gaza, says the report by [RootsAction](https://rootsaction.org/).

The draw is done. The schedule is set. For the US men’s national team, all that’s left, aside from playing the games, are the emotional highs and lows. After the draw, US head coach Mauricio Pochettino referenced a “competitive stress” factor triggered by the World Cup. He said the friendlies against Belgium and Portugal in March are intended to simulate that stress so that it doesn’t surprise his players when the spotlight of the World Cup arrives.

With the margins always thin at a World Cup, earning results that mitigate that pressure could prove to be the difference between the USMNT crashing out just when they capture the undivided attention of the nation, or enduring and soaring to a best-ever finish.

Shields (17-0, 3 KO) and Crews-Dezurn (10-2, 2 KO) first met nearly a decade ago when they [made their professional debuts against each other](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/19/claressa-shields-boxing-olympics-professional-debut-kovalev-ward) on the undercard of [Andre Ward’s victory over Sergey Kovalev](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/20/andre-ward-sergey-kovalev-boxing-points-decision-title-fight) in 2016. Shields won a four-round unanimous decision that night in Las Vegas, a moment she still sees as formative. “I had just come off winning two Olympic gold medals, fresh out of the amateurs, and finding an opponent was tough,” she said in a press release announcing the fight. “Franchon stepped in. I’ve grown a lot since that first victory, but me and Franchon have unfinished business that needs to be settled.”

Some of the money involved comes from the New York archdiocese’s cutting costs and selling off assets after Catholic priests, deacons and lay workers worldwide sexually preyed on children for decades – with the abusers being protected by their superiors.

      <source:markdown>Three proposed casinos approved as researchers say they take money from businesses and increase addiction

New York City will probably soon see three new casinos, whose owners could rake in profits because of a recent surge in gambling in the United States that has some campaigners worried.

The [New York](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york) gaming facility location board last week approved three proposed casinos in the US’s largest city – two in Queens and one in the Bronx – after determining the businesses would create new jobs and generate billions in tax revenue, according to the [group’s report](https://nycasinos.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2025/12/12.01.25.gflbselectiondocument.pdf).

This article was amended on 9 December 2025 to correct that the New York gaming facility location board approved the casinos last week, not this week as previously stated.

Good morning.

A coalition of global civil society organizations has [downgraded the civic health rating of the US](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/09/us-civic-health-rating-trump) from “narrowed” to “obstructed”.

**What** **does it mean by “obstructed”?** Countries where civic space is heavily contested – where civil society organizations still exist but state authorities undermine them, including through illegal surveillance, bureaucratic harassment and demeaning public statements.

**What’s holding up** **the European plan?** Though a majority of EU countries support the plan, it has met strong resistance from Belgium. About £160bn ($213bn) of Russian assets are immobilised at Euroclear, a central securities depository in Brussels, and the Belgian government is concerned that it will bear liability for any seizure and face retaliation from Moscow.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy has met the leaders of the UK, France and Germany in London amid heavy pressure from the Trump administration for Ukraine to cede territory it holds to bring the war to an end quickly.

The talks on Monday followed several days of [negotiations between US and Ukrainian officials](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/06/russia-overnight-attacks-across-ukraine-miami-peace-talks-continue), which ended on Saturday without an apparent breakthrough and were characterised by the Ukrainian president as “constructive, although not easy”.

The US defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, stated repeatedly in 2016 on Fox News that US service members should refuse “unlawful” orders from a potential president Trump – exactly the position he called “ [despicable](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5621756-pete-hegseth-democratic-lawmakers-influence-video/)” when Democratic lawmakers said it last month.

The debate about whether US soldiers should refuse illegal orders is now at the center of a fiery political dispute over the US killings of alleged drug traffickers in boats off the coast of Venezuela and Colombia.

The US’s [National Park](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/national-parks) Service (NPS) will offer free admission to US residents on Donald Trump’s birthday in 2026 – which also happens to be Flag Day – but is eliminating the benefit for Martin Luther King Jr Day and Juneteenth.

The new list of free admission days for Americans is the latest example of the [Trump administration](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration) downplaying America’s civil rights history while also promoting the president’s image, name and legacy.

This is how great runs end. Not with a single catastrophic collapse, but with a slow drift towards the finish, looking old, tired and out of ideas. For the Chiefs, that sense of finality arrived on Sunday night, delivered by the Texans in a 20-10 defeat at home that felt more lopsided than the score.

For much of this season, there had been a gnawing sense of inevitability about the Chiefs. Whether judging by the eye test or the advanced data, this year’s group has been _slightly_ better than the 15-win team who trudged through one-score victories last season, got hot in the playoffs and then were crushed by the Eagles in the Super Bowl. Even as the losses mounted this year, it felt like the Chiefs still had a run in them. If they could figure out their disjointed offense and find any juice on defense, they could sneak into the playoffs.

The warnings were stark. If Zohran Mamdani were to win the New York City mayoral election, his plans to raise taxes – slightly – on the city’s wealthiest residents would cause millionaires to bolt en masse, decamping to lower-tax states such as Florida and Texas.

The New York Post, a conservative tabloid owned by Rupert Murdoch, told readers on [an almost daily basis](https://www.google.com/search?q=nypost+people+flee+new+york+mamdani+october&#38;oq=nypost+people+flee+new+york+mamdani+october&#38;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIHCAEQIRiPAjIHCAIQIRiPAtIBCTEwNjE0ajBqN6gCALACAA&#38;sourceid=chrome&#38;ie=UTF-8) through October that New York would effectively become a ghost town under Mamdani’s mayoralty, a propaganda campaign that concluded the day before the election with the bombastic claim that [“nearly a million”](https://nypost.com/2025/11/03/us-news/nearly-a-million-new-yorkers-ready-to-flee-nyc-if-mamdani-becomes-mayor-poll/) people were planning to “flee”.

In just 737 days, he turned what had been the Football Bowl Subdivision’s most losing program into the nation’s No 1 seed heading into the playoffs, a legitimate championship contender and a Big Ten champion for the first time since 1967.

The woman who publicly alleged that she was 17 when a longtime Roman Catholic priest in [Alabama](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/alabama) successfully offered her financial support in exchange for sex and other forms of private companionship – recently prompting him to [resign](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/28/robert-sullivan-alabama-catholic-priest) from the clergy – says “there is no real winner in this situation”.

In her first remarks since Robert “Bob” Sullivan’s self-imposed removal from the priesthood was announced by his church superiors, Heather Jones wrote in a statement that the only thing she gained was “truth finally coming to light after years of gaslighting myself into thinking it wasn’t a big deal”.

      <title>Double-post salvation gives Busquets and Alba a fitting farewell in MLS Cup final</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/dec/06/inter-miami-mls-cup-messi-busquets-alba-vancouver</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Inter Miami survived a remarkable double-post escape before Messi and friends sealed the club’s first MLS Cup, giving Busquets and Alba a storybook farewell</p><p>The ball was going over the line. Surely. Definitely. Inter Miami would be behind. Lionel Messi’s chance at capturing the trophy he most wanted to win would be teetering on a knife’s edge. And perhaps most distressingly to Inter Miami, two retiring legends, Sergi Busquets and Jordi Alba, would be closing in on ignominious ends. They would have come to MLS to accompany Messi, their friend, but would end their time on the field as losers of a final, the type of game they so often won at club and international level.</p><p>All that ball had to do was cross the line.

      <source:markdown>Inter Miami survived a remarkable double-post escape before Messi and friends sealed the club’s first MLS Cup, giving Busquets and Alba a storybook farewell

The ball was going over the line. Surely. Definitely. Inter Miami would be behind. Lionel Messi’s chance at capturing the trophy he most wanted to win would be teetering on a knife’s edge.

His left-footed effort wrapped around the outstretched hand of Miami goalkeeper Rocco Ríos Novo. It smacked the inside of the far post. It bounced on the line.

      <source:markdown>Defense secretary defiant but allegations of war crimes and blistering watchdog report increase calls for him to go

[Pete Hegseth](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pete-hegseth) is facing the most serious crisis of his tenure as defense secretary, engulfed by allegations of war crimes in the Caribbean and a blistering [inspector general report](https://www.washingtonpost.com/documents/1ba8ad2c-5e41-4c54-ba1d-78e5feb66a2e.pdf) accusing him of mishandling classified military intelligence. Yet despite the long list of trouble and as lawmakers from both parties call for his resignation, Hegseth shows no signs of stepping down and still holds Donald Trump’s support.

The state quickly filed a lawsuit, with Newsom calling the move unprecedented and illegal, and the case has been unfolding in the courts for months.

The US Department of Justice has moved to eliminate rules protecting LGBTQ+ people from sexual abuse in prisons, a shift advocates say is “reckless and dangerous” and will lead to increased assaults behind bars.

A [justice department memo](https://prismreports.org/2025/12/04/prison-rape-elimination-act-trans-intersex-trump-doj/) issued on Tuesday said “effective immediately”, prisons and jails will no longer be held responsible for violations of standards meant to shield LGBTQ+ people from harassment, abuse and rape. It also directed inspectors to stop auditing facilities for compliance with those protections. The justice department is in the process of seeking formal updates to the rules, the memo said.

When Nigel Farage angrily denounced the BBC and [insulted one of its presenters](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/dec/04/farage-turns-on-broadcasters-racism-allegations-bbc) for raising questions about his alleged schoolboy racism, those who have been studying the tactics of the right noted that his behaviour felt familiar.

      <source:markdown>Paper published in 2000 found glyphosate was not harmful, while internal emails later revealed company’s influence

The journal Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology [has formally retracted](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273230099913715) a sweeping scientific paper published in 2000 that became a key defense for Monsanto’s claim that Roundup herbicide and its active ingredient glyphosate don’t cause cancer.

Martin van den Berg, the journal’s editor in chief, said in a [note](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273230099913715) accompanying the retraction that he had taken the step because of “serious ethical concerns regarding the independence and accountability of the authors of this article and the academic integrity of the carcinogenicity studies presented”.

The paper, titled Safety Evaluation and Risk Assessment of the Herbicide Roundup and Its Active Ingredient, Glyphosate, for Humans, concluded that Monsanto’s glyphosate-based weed killers posed no health risks to humans – no cancer risks, no reproductive risks, no adverse effects on development of endocrine systems in people or animals.

      <source:markdown>Ever since the club’s very beginning, David Beckham and Jorge Mas have had moments like this Saturday in mind

Back on 27 February 2020, days before Inter Miami’s first-ever fixture in MLS, I stood next to the club’s managing owner, Jorge Mas, and co-owner David Beckham as part of an MLS press junket in New York City. I was there for Sports Illustrated and my show Planet Fútbol TV, which I co-hosted with my friend, [the late, great Grant Wahl](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/10/grant-wahl-death-world-cup-qatar-2022-tribute-soccer).

Now, the club was finally starting life in MLS.

      <source:markdown>Major win for Trump as justices reject lower-court ruling that found maps had been racially gerrymandered

Texas can use a redrawn congressional map that adds as many as five Republican-friendly seats, the supreme court has ruled, giving Donald Trump and the GOP a major win in their push to add Republican congressional seats ahead of next year’s midterm elections.

The majority found the state had likely sorted voters based on their race – an unlawful practice called racial gerrymandering – when they adopted the new maps. The majority ordered the state to use the maps it had adopted after the 2020 census for next year’s election.

The meeting of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) turned confrontational at times before one member introduced a motion to delay the vote, which passed by six to three, to give advisers time to examine the wording before taking a vote.

A school district in Denver, Colorado, would have saved about $1m in 2023 had it been able to negotiate for and lock in the lowest of the platform’s continuously changing prices, according to one estimate cited in the report.

Any Lucia López Belloza had not seen her parents and two little sisters since starting her first semester at Babson College, near Boston in August. A family friend gave her plane tickets so she could fly home to Austin and surprise them for Thanksgiving.

The 19-year-old business student was already at the boarding gate at Boston airport when she was told there was an “error” with her boarding pass; when she reached customer service, she was handcuffed and arrested by what she believed were two Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( [ICE](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ice-us-immigration-and-customs-enforcement)) agents.

It was the kind of cold, damp morning that makes it hard to get out of bed, much less get a child out the door. The sun had not even risen when five-year-old Thomas Cooper and his mother, Annie Cooper, arrived for an appointment on 31 January at the Oxford Center in Troy, a northern suburb of Detroit, Michigan.

Thomas was an exuberant child with a button nose and pinchable cheeks – a little kid who loved running fast, playing Minecraft and watching Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, according to a GoFundMe set up by his family. He had just received money in a special red envelope for lunar new year, and he planned to spend it later that day with his little brother. But first, he was going to receive hyperbaric oxygen therapy for his attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and sleep apnea.

Donald Trump is seizing on the shooting of two national guard members, allegedly by an Afghan man, to press his immigration crackdown still farther. In the aftermath of the attack, which left guard member Sarah Beckstrom dead and colleague Andrew Wolfe in critical condition, Trump directed US Citizenship and Immigration Services to pause all pending asylum applications.

USCIS followed up that announcement with more seismic shifts to immigration policy. This is how the White House is reshaping the process for requesting asylum, green cards and citizenship.

      <source:markdown>Amnesty finds detainees at Florida facility were shackled and left outside in metal cage. Plus, how the dollar-store industry overcharges consumers

Good morning.

Detainees at the notorious Florida immigration jail known as “Alligator Alcatraz” were shackled inside a 2ft-high metal cage and left outside without water for up to a day at a time, a shocking report published on Thursday by Amnesty International alleges.

**Didn’t a judge order the facility to shut down?** A federal judge in August [ordered it to close](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/21/trump-alligator-alcatraz-judge-ruling) after a wave of criticism and a lawsuit by environmental groups. However, by October, the facility was operating again with hundreds of detainees after two Trump-appointed appellate court judges – one whose husband [has close ties](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/02/alligator-alcatraz-ron-desantis-paul-huck) to the Republican governor Ron DeSantis – blocked the closure ruling.

**Has the state of Florida responded to the allegations?** The press secretary to DeSantis told the Guardian the allegations were “fabrications” and part of a “politically motivated attack”.

**Why have they released these photos now?** It’s unclear. Even though the images do not reveal anything new, they keep the pressure on the Trump administration ahead of a 19 December deadline for the justice department to release files, as per the [Epstein Files Transparency Act](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/18/house-vote-epstein-documents), signed 19 November.

      <source:markdown>Pentagon’s Law of War manual clearly prohibits attack, but justification for whole campaign also faces tough questions

Graphic depictions of two survivors being killed by a second US military strike on an alleged Venezuelan drug ferrying boat have provoked outrage where previously there was none – or at least relatively little.

A firestorm of controversy has greeted a recent Washington Post report which suggested that a deadly attack on a vessel carrying 11 people in the Caribbean was followed with a second assault after the initial strike failed to kill everybody onboard.

Two fossil-fuel billionaires with close ties to Donald Trump bought millions of shares in the company they co-founded just days after a meeting with senior White House officials, who then issued a key regulatory permit that helped expand the company’s fortunes in Europe.

Robert Pender, an energy lawyer, and Michael Sabel, a former investment banker, are the [founders and co-chairs of Venture Global](https://ventureglobal.com/about-us/leadership/), a Virginia-based company that develops and operates liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminals.

Robert F Kennedy Jr’s vaccine advisory committee convenes on Thursday to consider a reversal of a decades-long program of childhood immunizations, including a recommendation to delay hepatitis B shots for newborn babies.

His reckless style is costing his teammates and coaches as well as himself</p><p>Jaxson Dart wants you to know something: <em>this is real football</em>. It’s not soccer or flag.

The Pentagon on Tuesday scapegoated a navy admiral for the extrajudicial double-tap strike that killed survivors of a 2 September attack on an alleged drug boat and vowed to continue operations, even as lawmakers investigate whether the attack constituted a war crime.

Wilson added that Pete Hegseth, the Pentagon secretary, “stands behind Admiral Bradley, 100%”.

A post on social media by US defense secretary [Pete Hegseth](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pete-hegseth), depicting a beloved children’s character aiming a rocket launcher at a cluster of boats, has elicited condemnation from the book’s Canadian publisher.

Hegseth’s post of the mocked cover of a Franklin the Turtle book titled Franklin Targets Narco Terrorists prompted disbelief and outrage. The image shows a smiling anthropomorphic turtle in military helmet and vest, with a US flag on his arm and a drug-laden boat exploding in the background. “For your Christmas wish list,” Hegseth wrote as the caption.

[Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump) has ordered a “pause” on asylum claims after last week’s shooting of two national guard members in Washington. The suspect in the shooting, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, is a 29-year-old Afghani national who assisted US forces during the two-decade war there and was paroled into the United States in 2021. US citizenship and immigration services awarded him asylum earlier this year.

It is not clear how long the president’s asylum pause will last. [Trump told reporters Sunday](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/11/30/donald-trump-pause-asylum-applications/87544306007/) that the directive “has no time limit, but it could be a long time”.

The suspect in the shooting of two [West Virginia](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/west-virginia) national guard soldiers in [Washington DC](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/washington-dc) on the eve of Thanksgiving had been struggling with his mental health, sometimes spending “weeks on end” in isolation, as he struggled to assimilate in the years since arriving in the United States, it has emerged.

According to emails obtained by the Associated Press, Rahmanullah Lakanwal’s mental health had been unravelling for years, leaving him unable to hold a job and flipping between long, dark stretches of isolation and taking sudden weeks-long cross-country drives.

[Luigi Mangione](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/09/unitedhealthcare-ceo-shooting-suspect-arrested) was kept under tight supervision in a Pennsylvania state prison last year because officials “did not want an Epstein-style situation”, a corrections officer said during Manhattan state court testimony on Monday.

This striking allusion to Jeffrey Epstein, the well-connected financier who died in jail awaiting trial on sex-trafficking, came during day one of a potentially weeklong proceeding to weigh the legality of evidence gathered during Mangione’s arrest at a McDonald’s restaurant after the killing of a prominent healthcare executive.

The 49ers’ season felt over after [Week 6’s loss to Tampa Bay](https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401772749/49ers-buccaneers). Yes, they were 4-2. Yes, they were tied with the Seahawks and Rams and had already won head-to-head games against both. But that’s when they hit rock bottom. All Pro linebacker Fred Warner [was the latest casualty](https://ninerswire.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/niners/2025/11/28/49ers-fred-warner-injury-update/87510140007/), following [in the footsteps](https://www.sfgate.com/49ers/article/49ers-star-nick-bosa-spotted-walking-no-crutches-21165974.php) of All Pro edge rusher Nick Bosa with a season-ending injury. Brock Purdy had also struggled with injuries. George Kittle was hurt in Week 1. Both were not expected to return for several games. Brandon Aiyuk had no plans to play any time soon, at least not for San Francisco. By Week 7, the only big names in action were Christian McCaffrey and Trent Williams.

Dire as the 49ers appeared on paper, they hung in. It helped that the Cardinals, Falcons, Giants, and Panthers featured in their upcoming schedule. They beat all four of them, losing only to the Texans and Rams in the next few weeks. None of the wins inspired much confidence, though. The Cardinals outgained the 49ers by 200 yards.

Carolina’s defense intercepted Stafford twice with Mike Jackson returning one for a 48-yard touchdown and ended the 37-year-old’s NFL record of 28 straight TD passes without an interception. Derrick Brown, who tipped a ball resulting in one of Stafford’s first pick, came up with a key strip-sack with 2:25 left in the game to preserve the win. Stafford completed 18 of 28 passes for 243 yards with two touchdown passes to Davante Adams, his 13th and 14th of the season.

The shooting suspect, 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal, was [granted](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/27/washington-dc-national-guard-shooting-suspect) asylum under the Trump administration in April 2025. He worked with CIA backed units in Afghanistan, coming to the US in September 2021 under an Operation Allies Welcome program.

The decision stunned “DD” – an 18-year-old freshman at the University of Alabama named Daniel DiDonato – who learned his map had been selected as he was preparing to leave for his 9.30am introduction to political science class.

      <source:markdown>Republicans and Democrats alike look to fill congressional firebrand’s House seat when she departs in 2026

Marjorie Taylor Greene for president. Randy Bone rolled the idea around in his hands for a second as he stood inside his wife’s antique shop in Ringgold, Georgia. He’s heard the talk. He’s even seen the prediction market action. He doesn’t have a problem with his boisterous, attention-seeking congresswoman. He just doesn’t think it will work.

“I don’t know. I don’t see her as one that is very attractive … You’ve got to focus on those that are kind of in the middle, and I don’t think that she’s unifying enough,” he said.

Acquiring solar panels at home can be an expensive hassle for people in the US. But small, simple, plug-in solar panels for use on balconies are soon to become available for millions of Americans, with advocates hoping the technology will quickly go mainstream.

      <source:markdown>Former oversight officials alarmed by dismantling of DHS system that oversees complaints about civil rights harms

The federal watchdog system at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that oversees complaints about civil rights violations, including in immigration detention, has been gutted so thoroughly that it could be laying the groundwork for the Trump administration to “abuse people with impunity”, experts warn.

Former federal oversight officials have sounded the alarm at the rapid dismantling of guardrails against human rights failures – at the same time as the government [pushes](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/21/deportations-us-government-shutdown-ice-data) aggressive [immigration](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usimmigration) enforcement operations.

Border Patrol agents in Arizona forcibly removed a detained man from a cell, handcuffed him and then injected him with ketamine to sedate him in 2023, according to a [CRCL document](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26301388-cbp-ketamine-memo/) confirming the watchdog’s investigation into the allegation. A Guardian reporter had saved that document just weeks before it was scrubbed from the DHS’s website.

Guards at a privately owned Louisiana detention center systematically mistreated detained immigrants, according to a CRCL [document](https://rfkhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/assets/Pepper-spray-Incident-CRCL-Complaint-Winn_3.27.24.pdf).This included an investigation into a [2024 incident](https://theappeal.org/biden-admin-extended-contract-abusive-ice-detention-center/) during which correctional staff pepper sprayed around 200 detained immigrants who were staging a hunger strike in protest of detention conditions. Guards then allegedly locked the men in the unit and cut the power and water for hours. A majority of the men were allegedly denied medical care, the original [complaint](https://rfkhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/assets/Pepper-spray-Incident-CRCL-Complaint-Winn_3.27.24.pdf), submitted to the CRCL by RFK Human Rights, said.

In a Florida jail, a 33-year-old immigrant woman with mental health problems was forcibly stripped naked, strapped to a restraint chair and mocked by male guards, according to a CRCL [complaint](https://www.aclufl.org/app/uploads/2024/11/anas_crcl_final_version.pdf) submitted by the ACLU of Florida and RFK Human Rights. The woman was allegedly left with “contusions and marks on her body” after hours in the restraint chair. The whistleblower declaration said the CRCL had launched an investigation into the case.

Agents violated due process during the arrest and detention of Palestinian student and Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil, according to the whistleblower [complaint](https://whistleblower.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/05-15-2025-GovAcctProj-Whistleblower-Disclosures-to-Congress-re-CRCL.pdf).

A crusading prosecutor in the Balkans comes under pressure to drop a big case. Vietnamese villagers learn they are to be evicted. A convicted crypto kingpin in the Gulf receives a pardon.

All have one thing in common: they appear to be connected to the Trump family’s campaign to amass riches around the world. Since Donald Trump’s re-election a year ago, warnings that his use of presidential power to advance personal interests is corroding American democracy have grown ever louder. What is less understood – and perhaps even more dangerous – is the damage this is doing everywhere else.

Donald Trump’s hateful, falsehood-filled rant on Thursday blaming immigrants for crime, “social dysfunction” and economic hardship is refuted by a wide range of immigration statistics, which show clearly that immigrants dramatically [bolster the US economy](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/content/explainer-immigrants-and-us-economy) and commit crimes at far [lower rates](https://www.ucdavis.edu/curiosity/blog/do-immigrants-get-incarcerated-more) than people born in the US.

On Thursday evening, Trump condemned immigrants in [a broad and vicious invective](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1994262111145365516), painting them as “illegal and disruptive populations” and attacking “those that hate, steal, murder and destroy everything that America stands for”.

Donald Trump’s tariffs have increased prices on an array of popular holiday goods and driven a “massive” number of small firms out of business, industry leaders have warned.

On [Small Business Saturday](https://www.sba.gov/about-sba/organization/observances/small-business-saturday), firms have their fingers crossed that strong holiday sales will ease the impact of a tough year. But many aren’t holding their breath.

      <source:markdown>Next nominee faces enormous task of leading a party that has been entirely reoriented around Trump

Donald Trump hasn’t stopped joking about running again for the White House in 2028, even as he acknowledges it is “pretty clear” he is constitutionally ineligible for a third term. Whether intended as a taunt or a threat, his musings are a reminder that, even barred from the ballot, Trump is likely to remain a central figure in the campaign to succeed him.

The next Republican nominee faces the potentially enormous task of leading a party that has been entirely reoriented around Trump into a post-Trump era. Here’s a look at the Republicans best positioned for a White House run.

Retiring Georgia congresswoman **Marjorie Taylor Greene**

Homeland security secretary **Kristi Noem**

Health and human services secretary **Robert F Kennedy Jr**

Arkansas governor **Sarah Huckabee Sanders**

Virginia governor **Glenn Youngkin**

Georgia governor **Brian Kemp**

South Carolina senator **Tim Scott**

Former UN ambassador **Nikki Haley**

Utah governor **Spencer Cox**

US regulators say they are taking allegations that top banks may have facilitated Jeffrey Epstein’s criminal activity “very seriously”, as they faced calls to investigate executives including the former Barclays boss Jes Staley.

In correspondence seen by the Guardian, bosses from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) said they [had reviewed a letter from the Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/28/elizabeth-warren-urges-us-regulators-to-investigate-jes-staley-ties-to-epstein), which raised concerns over bankers’ alleged support for the convicted child sex offender Epstein.
