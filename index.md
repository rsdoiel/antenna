# The Antenna

> An experiment in personal news aggragration

The Antenna is organized around lists of RSS, Atom and JSONfeeds that website publish
to promote their content. Right now Antenna is build from two lists

- [socal_north.urls](socal_north.urls), feeds from organizations, governments and groups in "Northern" Southern California
- [weather.urls](weather.urls), weather information from [NOAA's](https://noaa.gov) [weather.gov](https://weather.gov) website.

All the feed content is from the source of the feeds (listed with each item) but the selection of which feeds to feature is mine.

To read more about this experiment in the [README](README.md) file.
