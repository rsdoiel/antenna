# The Antenna

> An experiment in personal news aggregation

The Antenna is designed to provide me a way to quickly scan new content on the web. Antenna is a variation on a [Linklog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linklog). A list of feeds is aggregated into a collection. Each collection's items are sorted in descending date ordered and displayed as a webpage. Collection aggregate for a week before being archived.
