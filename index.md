# The Antenna

> An experiment in personal news aggregation

The Antenna is organized around lists of RSS, Atom and JSONfeeds that website publish
to promote their content. Right now Antenna is build from four lists

- [Mid Central](mid_central.html), feeds from Central California's Merced County
- [SoCal North](socal_north.html), feeds from the Northern end of Southern California
	- [socal_north.txt](socal_north.txt)
- [Pacific](pacific.html), feeds from the Pacific
	- [pacific.txt](pacific.ttx)
- [Weather](weather.html), national weather information from [NOAA's](https://noaa.gov) [weather.gov](https://weather.gov) website.
	- [weather.txt](weather.txt)

All the feed items are responsibility of the organizations that publish the feed. My choice is the specific feeds I select for my aggregation.
