# The Antenna

> An experiment in personal news aggragration

The Antenna is organized around lists of RSS, Atom and JSONfeeds that website publish
to promote their content. Right now Antenna is build from two lists

- [socal_north.txt](socal_north.txt), feeds from organizations, governments and groups in representing the Northern side of Southern California
- [pacific.txt](pacific.ttx), feeds from around the Pacific
- [weather.txt](weather.txt), national weather information from [NOAA's](https://noaa.gov) [weather.gov](https://weather.gov) website.

All the feed items are responsibility of the organizations that publish the feed. My choice is the specific feeds I select for my aggregation.
