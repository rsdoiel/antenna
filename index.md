# The Antenna

> An experiment in personal news aggregation

The Antenna is organized around lists of RSS, Atom and JSONfeeds that websites publish
to promote their content. Right now Antenna is build from five lists

- [SoCal North](socal_north.html), feeds from the Northern end of Southern California
	- [socal_north.txt](socal_north.txt)
- [Pacific](pacific.html), feeds from the Micronesia, Hawaii and the Pacific
	- [pacific.txt](pacific.txt)
- [Mid Central](mid_central.html), feeds from Central California's in the vicinity of Merced County
- [Weather](weather.html), national weather information from [NOAA's](https://noaa.gov) [weather.gov](https://weather.gov) website.
	- [weather.txt](weather.txt)
- [Tech Likely](tech_likely.html), miscellanious feeds but mostly computing related, ported from my newsboat list
- [Columns](columns.html), posts that frequently end up in my [Pocket](https://getpocket.com) reading list

All the feed items are responsibility of the organizations that publish the feed. My choice is the specific feeds I select for my aggregation.
