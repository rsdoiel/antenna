Tesla, a company that prides itself on not advertising, is in the midst of a serious marketing effort. In doing so it’s exploiting employees, attacking shareholders, and retaining outside strategy firms to help it advertise.

It’s running these ads not to boost its [falling sales](https://electrek.co/2025/08/05/tesla-sales-in-europe-are-in-free-fall-and-the-pain-is-just-starting/), but rather to advocate for another unprecedented award for its CEO, which would keep the company stuck with him for years even as [earnings drop precipitously](https://electrek.co/2025/10/22/tesla-tsla-releases-q3-2025-financing-results-earnings-decline-despite-record-revenue/) under his direction.

( _**Update:** This article, originally posted 10/18, has now been updated to acknowledge Musk’s comments this week on “corporate terrorism” and on his desire to “control” an “enormous robot army”)_
