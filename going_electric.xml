It’s smart, solid, and surprisingly bold in how it tackles the task of mowing, all without needing any backbreaking effort from you.</p>

        <p>The Trump administration argues this spending will keep aging coal plants running, lower electricity costs, and prevent blackouts. But this so-called coal revival plan wastes millions when clean energy is cheaper and growing at a breakneck pace.</p>

A new report from the International Energy Agency (IEA) shows just how dramatic the surge is. Electricity use in the region has tripled since 2000, and it’s expected to jump another 50% by 2035. That’s like adding the current combined electricity demand of Germany and Spain.</p>

Meet the Škoda Vision O (Passat badges not included).</p>

Of course, the first thing that stands out about the new Leaf is its design. Nissan says it’s adopting a subcompact crossover style instead of the hatchback style in the previous two iterations.</p>
        
        
        
        <p>I’ve always had a soft spot in my heart for the quirky design of the first-generation Leaf, but the design was polarizing to say the least. The second-generation Leaf was more widely palatable, but bland and almost forgettable. The design team at Nissan stepped up hugely with the 2026 Leaf, channeling looks from the Nissan Ariya, which shares the same EV platform.</p>

I also get about a dozen emails a day from people asking what type of e-bike would be best for them, so it’d probably be more efficient to simply tell everyone the correct answer all at once. </p>
        
        
        
        <p>If you ask me, there’s one e-bike style that will work for more people than just about anything else on the market. I’m not saying it’s the perfect choice for <em>everyone</em> – there’s no such thing – but if you’re staring at a dozen browser tabs of e-bike specs and feeling decision fatigue, this is the style I’d point you toward.</p>
