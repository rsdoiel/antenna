Tesla, a company that prides itself on not advertising, is in the midst of a serious marketing effort. In doing so it’s exploiting employees, attacking shareholders, and retaining outside strategy firms to help it advertise.

It’s running these ads not to boost its [falling sales](https://electrek.co/2025/08/05/tesla-sales-in-europe-are-in-free-fall-and-the-pain-is-just-starting/), but rather to advocate for another unprecedented award for its CEO, which would keep the company stuck with him for years even as [earnings drop precipitously](https://electrek.co/2025/10/22/tesla-tsla-releases-q3-2025-financing-results-earnings-decline-despite-record-revenue/) under his direction.

( _**Update:** This article, originally posted 10/18, has now been updated to acknowledge Musk’s comments this week on “corporate terrorism” and on his desire to “control” an “enormous robot army”)_

It looks like retail giant Target has been reading our posts about [the Chevy Brightdrop being the best deal in the commercial EV business](https://electrek.co/2025/04/05/costco-executive-members-get-massive-31500-off-chevy-brightdrop-van/), because the company has picked GM’s electric box van to pilot a new, dedicated last-mile delivery service in Dallas-Fort Worth.

For years, Tesla Powerwall has been the go-to recommendation for “normals” looking for a painless, low-effort experience from their first home solar and battery backup solutions. [Its CEO’s recent involvement in controversial politics](https://electrek.co/2025/05/23/tesla-ranks-under-unitedhealth-temu-bp-in-brand-reputation-poll-due-to-musk/), however, [means that people are now distancing themselves from the once-trailblazing company](https://electrek.co/2025/03/03/tesla-owners-get-creative-to-distance-themselves-from-elon-with-new-car-logos-projectors/). It begs the question: **what other home solar battery solutions are there**?

**UPDATE 18OCT2025**: [added a new, American brand choice](https://electrek.co/2025/10/18/opinion-its-time-to-start-recommending-some-tesla-powerwall-alternatives/#:~:text=The%20new%20SimpliPHI,add%20more%20batteries!).

Tesla, a company that prides itself on not advertising, is in the midst of a serious marketing effort. In doing so it’s exploiting employees, attacking shareholders, and retaining outside strategy firms to help it advertise.

It’s running these ads not to boost its [falling sales](https://electrek.co/2025/08/05/tesla-sales-in-europe-are-in-free-fall-and-the-pain-is-just-starting/), but rather to advocate for another unprecedented award for its CEO, which would keep the company stuck with him for years even as earnings drop precipitously under his direction.
