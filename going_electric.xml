First Solar, the US’s largest solar panel manufacturer, has now announced the location of its [new solar factory](https://electrek.co/2025/10/31/us-largest-solar-panel-maker-to-open-a-new-3-7-gw-factory/). The company says it will build a new facility in Gaffney, South Carolina, to handle the final production steps for its Series 6 Plus thin film modules. Those components are currently made by First Solar’s factories overseas, but once the South Carolina plant opens in the second half of 2026, they’ll be finished on US soil.

Tesla’s EV registrations in the UK, its biggest market in Europe, took a dramatic hit in October 2025 — just 511 units — marking one of the brand’s weakest showings in recent memory. That’s a steep drop from 971 in October 2024 and 2,677 in October 2023. The tone of the market is shifting.

Maybe Tesla’s CEO stoking a civil war in England isn’t helping the automaker’s demand in the important market.

Tesla is [recalling](https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls?nhtsaId=25V735) 6,197 Cybertrucks with the “Off Road Lightbar” attachment, citing incorrect use of adhesives which could lead the accessory to fall off during vehicle operation.

It’s about 10% of the 63,619 Cybertrucks in existence, which we know about due to _another_ recall from last week (though that one was fixed by a software update) – showing that the Cybertruck is selling a lot more poorly than initial estimates would have suggested.
