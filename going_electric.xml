Elon Musk announced last night that Tesla is planning to “roughly double” its Robotaxi fleet in Austin next month. While an expansion of the pilot sounds positive on the surface, a look at the actual numbers reveals that Tesla is missing its own “end of year” target by a massive margin.

It’s not quite a full-size electric bike, but definitely not a mini-bike either. It has no pedals, yet it feels like a legit vehicle, not a toy. And while its higher price tag isn’t exactly budget-friendly, the Doble offers something that’s surprisingly rare in the e-bike world: a two-person ride that’s actually fun, compact, and borderline addictive.</p>

When I first saw the [JackRabbit MG Doble](https://alnk.to/3ydVs50) upon its unveiling [earlier this year](https://electrek.co/2025/08/12/two-people-one-scooter-jackrabbit-unveils-micro-hauler-line-of-two-seater-rides/), I wasn’t totally sure what to expect. It’s not quite a full-size electric bike, but definitely not a mini-bike either. It has no pedals, yet it feels like a legit vehicle, not a toy. And while its higher price tag isn’t exactly budget-friendly, the Doble offers something that’s surprisingly rare in the e-bike world: a two-person ride that’s actually fun, compact, and borderline addictive.

For most of human history, currency was a direct claim on tangible, productive output. Before the abstraction of government fiat or cryptocurrency, value was stored in things that required real work and resources, bushels of grain, livestock, gold, assets with their own direct productive output: horses, and tragically, slaves.

These were the foundational assets of economies, representing a direct link between labor, resources, and stored value.

As we accelerate into an all-electric, all-digital age, this fundamental link is re-emerging, but with a new unit of account. The 21st-century economy, defined by automated industry, robotic, electric transport, and now power-hungry artificial intelligence, runs on a single, non-negotiable input: electricity. In this new paradigm, the real base currency, the ultimate representation of productive capacity, is the kilowatt-hour (kWh).

The General Motors EV1 has a vital place in electric vehicle history. It mainly served to show two things:

1. Show a viable path for battery-electric vehicles back in the 1990s.
2. Some forces are clearly at play to suppress electric cars.

GM only leased the EV1, never sold any, and prevented almost anyone from keeping them when it killed the vehicle program.

The automaker ended up crushing the vast majority of them. While a few empty shells exist in museums, they are strictly prohibited from ever driving again. But a new project has surfaced involving what appears to be the only legally owned EV1 in private hands, and the new owner plans to put it back on the road with a modern battery pack.

A YouTube channel called _Electrek Garage_ (no relation to us, though we like the name) posted a fascinating video detailing the acquisition and restoration plan for this unicorn of an EV.

Tesla has been granted a Transportation Network Company (TNC) permit by the Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT), enabling the company to operate a paid ride-hailing service in the state officially.

This will allow Tesla to launch its ‘Robotaxi’ similarly to how it does in California – meaning with Uber drivers using Full Self-Driving Supervised (FSD).

For years, Tesla Powerwall has been the go-to recommendation for “normals” looking for a painless, low-effort experience from their first home solar and battery backup solutions. [But with a recent recall on more than 10,000 home batteries over fire safety concerns](https://electrek.co/2025/11/13/tesla-recalls-over-10000-powerwalls-in-the-us-after-several-fires/), more and more people are beginning to look for alternatives to the trailblazing Tesla brand. The good news: **there are plenty of other great home solar battery solutions are there**!

**UPDATE 13NOV2025**: [added a new, American brand choice](https://electrek.co/2025/11/13/opinion-its-time-to-start-recommending-some-tesla-powerwall-alternatives/#:~:text=If%20you%E2%80%99re%20looking%20for%20a%20one%2Dbrand%20solution%20for%20EV%20charging%20and%20whole%2Dhome%20battery%20backup%20but%20don%E2%80%99t%20want%20to%20be%20%E2%80%9Clocked%20in%E2%80%9D%20to%20GM%20or%20Tesla%E2%80%99s%20ecosystem%2C%20Enphase%20offers%20a%20full%20line%20of%20Made%2Din%2Dthe%2DUSA%20solutions%20that%20could%20be%20right%20for%20you.).
