That can include residential solar panels, battery storage, EVs, and smart thermostats. When the grid needs help during peak demand or emergencies, they can be tapped – and you get paid for participating.</p>

It was a Father’s Day present for my dad, who has several acres of property to manage and is reaching the point where even his dad strength isn’t enough to hand saw all day. I wasn’t quite sure what to expect from the current state of electric chainsaws, but I was excited to put the new machine to work. Fast forward a full year, and I’ve got an update: we’ve abused the heck out of it – and it’s still going strong!</p>

A new report from the International Energy Agency (IEA) shows just how dramatic the surge is. Electricity use in the region has tripled since 2000, and it’s expected to jump another 50% by 2035. That’s like adding the current combined electricity demand of Germany and Spain.</p>

Meet the Škoda Vision O (Passat badges not included).</p>
