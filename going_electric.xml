China was responsible for installing a massive 256 GW of that solar capacity.</p>

I’ve tried a<a href="https://electrek.co/2023/12/21/viribus-trio-plus-electric-tricycle-review-the-lowest-cost-e-trike-id-still-ride/"> Viribus e-trike before</a>, and while it got the job done, it was a fairly basic and entry level model. But this time, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the SC5 delivers more than just the basics.</p>
        
        
        
        <p>I’ve been testing it now for various errands, grocery runs, and casual rides around the neighborhood. After logging some decent miles on it, here’s what I’ve learned about this three-wheeled e-bike, and why I think it’s a strong contender in the growing world of electric trikes.</p>

Through thousands of miles of riding, I’ve been fortunate to learn these e-bikes inside and out, top to bottom and front to back. That long-term experience with real-world e-bike testing has helped me find the best electric bicycles on the market for just about any budget.</p>
        
        
        
        <p>Below are some of the top e-bikes I’ve hand-tested for every price range, current as of September 2025. Summer may be in the rear view mirror (nooo!), but this is still a great chance to grab some end-of-summer sales on a new electric bicycle! So check out the awesome e-bikes below, any one of which could become your next electric bike.</p>

      <title>Shift Key Classic: How to Hook Up More Power Plants</title>

        <![CDATA[<p><em>Shift Key is off for Labor Day, so we’re re-running this classic episode.</em></p><br><p>For the first time in 15 years, American electricity demand is rising again as new data centers, factories, and electric vehicles come online. The easiest option is to meet that new demand with new supply — new power plants. But in many parts of the country, it can take years to hook up new wind, solar, and batteries to the grid. The reason why is a clogged and broken system called the interconnection queue.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><p>On this week’s episode of Shift Key, which first aired in 2024, Jesse and Rob speak with two experts about how to understand — and how to fix — what is perhaps the biggest obstacle to deploying more renewables on the U.S. power grid.&nbsp;</p><br><p><a href="https://nicholasinstitute.duke.edu/people/tyler-norris" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tyler Norris</a> is a doctoral student at Duke University’s Nicholas School of the Environment.
