The easiest option is to meet that new demand with new supply — new power plants. But in many parts of the country, it can take years to hook up new wind, solar, and batteries to the grid. The reason why is a clogged and broken system called the interconnection queue.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><p>On this week’s episode of Shift Key, which first aired in 2024, Jesse and Rob speak with two experts about how to understand — and how to fix — what is perhaps the biggest obstacle to deploying more renewables on the U.S. power grid.&nbsp;</p><br><p><a href="https://nicholasinstitute.duke.edu/people/tyler-norris" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tyler Norris</a> is a doctoral student at Duke University’s Nicholas School of the Environment.
