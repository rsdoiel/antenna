Tesla is [recalling](https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls?nhtsaId=25V735) 6,197 Cybertrucks with the “Off Road Lightbar” attachment, citing incorrect use of adhesives which could lead the accessory to fall off during vehicle operation.

It’s about 10% of the 63,619 Cybertrucks in existence, which we know about due to _another_ recall from last week (though that one was fixed by a software update) – showing that the Cybertruck is selling a lot more poorly than initial estimates would have suggested.

The number of e-bikes that charge via USB-C just doubled. From one… to two.

Tesla, a company that prides itself on not advertising, is in the midst of a serious marketing effort. In doing so it’s exploiting employees, attacking shareholders, and retaining outside strategy firms to help it advertise.

It’s running these ads not to boost its [falling sales](https://electrek.co/2025/08/05/tesla-sales-in-europe-are-in-free-fall-and-the-pain-is-just-starting/), but rather to advocate for another unprecedented award for its CEO, which would keep the company stuck with him for years even as [earnings drop precipitously](https://electrek.co/2025/10/22/tesla-tsla-releases-q3-2025-financing-results-earnings-decline-despite-record-revenue/) under his direction.

( _**Update:** This article, originally posted 10/18, has now been updated to acknowledge Musk’s comments this week on “corporate terrorism” and on his desire to “control” an “enormous robot army”)_

It begs the question: **what other home solar battery solutions are there**?

**UPDATE 18OCT2025**: [added a new, American brand choice](https://electrek.co/2025/10/18/opinion-its-time-to-start-recommending-some-tesla-powerwall-alternatives/#:~:text=The%20new%20SimpliPHI,add%20more%20batteries!).

Tesla, a company that prides itself on not advertising, is in the midst of a serious marketing effort. In doing so it’s exploiting employees, attacking shareholders, and retaining outside strategy firms to help it advertise.

It’s running these ads not to boost its [falling sales](https://electrek.co/2025/08/05/tesla-sales-in-europe-are-in-free-fall-and-the-pain-is-just-starting/), but rather to advocate for another unprecedented award for its CEO, which would keep the company stuck with him for years even as earnings drop precipitously under his direction.
