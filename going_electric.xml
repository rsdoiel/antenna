Consumer Reports is out with its latest study on used car reliability, and the headlines are already circulating: Tesla has landed at the very bottom of the list.

The study, which examines 5-to-10-year-old vehicles, ranks Tesla 26th out of 26 brands, placing it behind Chrysler, Dodge, and even Jeep – brands known for decades for their reliability issues.

While critics will undoubtedly use this as ammo to attack the brand, a closer look at the data reveals a much more nuanced picture, one that highlights just how recent an automaker Tesla still is.

That’s the feeling I had while testing the VTOMAN FlashSpeed Pro 3600, a 3.1 kWh, 3.6 kW monster of a power box that – despite weighing as much as a medium-sized meteor – rolls around surprisingly easily thanks to its integrated handle and wheels. And at its current price <a href="https://vtoman.com/products/vtoman-flashspeed-pro-3600-power-station?variant=45055026888873">of $1,399</a>, it’s one of the better deals I’ve seen in the high-capacity power station space.</p>

Portable power stations have gotten impressively capable over the last few years, but every now and then you run into one that genuinely changes your sense of scale.

And at its current price [of $1,399](https://vtoman.com/products/vtoman-flashspeed-pro-3600-power-station?variant=45055026888873), it’s one of the better deals I’ve seen in the high-capacity power station space.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk took to X (formerly Twitter) this morning to dismiss Waymo’s progress in autonomous driving, claiming that the Alphabet-owned company “never really had a chance against Tesla” and that this will be “obvious in hindsight.”

The comment came as a direct response to a discussion about Waymo’s newly released safety data—a level of transparency that Tesla has yet to match.

      <source:markdown>China’s electric vehicle industry, it’s now well understood, is churning out cars that rival or exceed the best products coming out of the West. Chinese EVs are cheaper, cooler, more innovative, and have better range. And now they’re surging into car markets around the world — markets where consumers are hungry for clean, affordable transportation.

On this week’s episode of Shift Key, Rob talks to Ilaria Mazzocco about [her new report](https://www.csis.org/analysis/global-ev-shift-role-china-and-industrial-policy-emerging-economies) on how six countries around the world are dealing with the rise of Chinese EVs. Why do countries welcome Chinese-made EVs, and why do countries resist them? How do domestic carmakers act when Chinese EVs come to town? And are climate concerns still driving uptake?

Mazzocco is the deputy director and senior fellow with the Trustee Chair in Chinese Business and Economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Shift Key is hosted by Robinson Meyer, the founding executive editor of Heatmap, and Jesse Jenkins, a professor of energy systems engineering at Princeton University. Jesse is off this week.

Imagine a self-driving car fused with a humanoid robot, shrunk down to indoor-outdoor mobility scale. That’s the EV1.

For years, the loudest and most persistent argument coming from the Tesla camp, including Elon Musk himself, against Waymo has been simple: “Sure, it works, but it can’t scale.”

The narrative, usually pushed by those heavily invested in the promise of Tesla’s “generalized Full Self-Driving”, was that Waymo was a geofenced parlor trick. They argued that Waymo’s reliance on lidar, radar, and, specifically, high-definition (HD) mapping would mean it would take years to launch in every new city.

But the narrative is now dying, as Waymo went from testing to fully autonomous in a couple of Texas cities in just a few months.
