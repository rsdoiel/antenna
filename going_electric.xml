We are talking about monthly payments increasing by up to 67% in some cases.

Consumer Reports is out with its latest study on used car reliability, and the headlines are already circulating: Tesla has landed at the very bottom of the list.

The study, which examines 5-to-10-year-old vehicles, ranks Tesla 26th out of 26 brands, placing it behind Chrysler, Dodge, and even Jeep – brands known for decades for their reliability issues.

While critics will undoubtedly use this as ammo to attack the brand, a closer look at the data reveals a much more nuanced picture, one that highlights just how recent an automaker Tesla still is.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk took to X (formerly Twitter) this morning to dismiss Waymo’s progress in autonomous driving, claiming that the Alphabet-owned company “never really had a chance against Tesla” and that this will be “obvious in hindsight.”

The comment came as a direct response to a discussion about Waymo’s newly released safety data—a level of transparency that Tesla has yet to match.

I’ve ridden [a lot of electric scooters](http://electrek.co/guides/electric-scooter) over the years. Most blur together – two wheels, a deck, a motor, and a series of compromises.

      <source:markdown>China’s electric vehicle industry, it’s now well understood, is churning out cars that rival or exceed the best products coming out of the West. Chinese EVs are cheaper, cooler, more innovative, and have better range. And now they’re surging into car markets around the world — markets where consumers are hungry for clean, affordable transportation.

On this week’s episode of Shift Key, Rob talks to Ilaria Mazzocco about [her new report](https://www.csis.org/analysis/global-ev-shift-role-china-and-industrial-policy-emerging-economies) on how six countries around the world are dealing with the rise of Chinese EVs. Why do countries welcome Chinese-made EVs, and why do countries resist them? How do domestic carmakers act when Chinese EVs come to town? And are climate concerns still driving uptake?

Mazzocco is the deputy director and senior fellow with the Trustee Chair in Chinese Business and Economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Shift Key is hosted by Robinson Meyer, the founding executive editor of Heatmap, and Jesse Jenkins, a professor of energy systems engineering at Princeton University. Jesse is off this week.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the company will remove “safety monitors” from the passenger seats of Tesla’s Robotaxi vehicles in “about three weeks,” which would mean we’d see completely driverless Teslas in the Austin area potentially by the end of the year – if that timeline sticks.

I recently attended Strutt’s Demo Day to check out the company’s new EV1 mobility device, and even if you’ve never paid attention to electric wheelchairs before, you’ll still probably find this interesting.

The EV1 isn’t really a wheelchair in the traditional sense. It’s closer to an autonomous robot that just happens to take the form of a chair. Imagine a self-driving car fused with a humanoid robot, shrunk down to indoor-outdoor mobility scale. That’s the EV1. And after having spent some seat time in it, I can tell you that this technology is _going to change lives_.

Does the law agree with this?

For years, the loudest and most persistent argument coming from the Tesla camp, including Elon Musk himself, against Waymo has been simple: “Sure, it works, but it can’t scale.”

They argued that Waymo’s reliance on lidar, radar, and, specifically, high-definition (HD) mapping would mean it would take years to launch in every new city.

But the narrative is now dying, as Waymo went from testing to fully autonomous in a couple of Texas cities in just a few months.
