date: 2024-02-15, from: OS News

The robots.txt file governs a give and take; AI feels to many like all take and no give.

And the fundamental agreement behind robots.txt, and the web as a whole — which for so long amounted to “everybody just be cool” — may not be able to keep up either. ↫ David Pierce for The Verge Another thing &#8220;AI&#8221; does not respect.

I'm getting good at it. Yesterday I did that with the <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/02/13.html#a214721">piece</a> about President Biden and how he probably would rather be doing anything than be President, for a mostly thankless country, at age 81. I imagine he has great-grandchildren he'd like to get to know. Maybe a book or two to read, maybe one to write. To get his affairs in order. At age 68 I'm trying to shed responsibility as much as possible. It's prudent, and has a point. When I was 25 I wanted to take over the world. Now I'd just like to feel good. As you get older you are capable of more depth of feeling, in some ways, and grow more numb in others. I spent time with my father at 80, his last year. He was always a curious man, wanting to learn about anything new, but in his last days he wasn't curious. No ambition. But he seemed okay with it, even happy at times (possibly due in part to the morphine he was allowed). Anyway, it's always interesting to see where people react to what among the different social web networks. And in this case, the most flow came from <a href="https://mastodon.social/@davew/111926409460785756">Mastodon</a>, by far. I would not have predicted that. And it's good to see, that interesting ideas and perspective may have more of a future outside the networks operated by the billionaire tech companies.

## Ai and Robots

date: 2024-02-14, from: Manu - I write blog

<p>David Pierce at The Verge just published a great long-form piece about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24067997/robots-txt-ai-text-file-web-crawlers-spiders">robots.txt</a>, the relationship between the people running websites and the people running spiders and crawlers, and what’s happening now that AI has entered the scene.</p>
<p>It’s a great piece and the timing is convenient for me personally because just the other day I emailed the lovely people at The Browser Company asking how can I opt out of their stupid <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/a-rant-on-arc-search">ARC Search</a>. They care about users and user experience and so do I so I’m sure they must have a way for me to block their new AI. I’m still waiting to get a reply…</p>

## 2024-02-09 Oddµ namespaces and live updating

date: 2024-02-14, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1>2024-02-09 Oddµ namespaces and live updating</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a slow morning. I had my two cups of coffee, ate my pancakes with plum jam, spent time online reading Mastodon, talked to my wife about wannabe-axe murderers on Swiss trains, looked up stuff about <a href="https://www.tax-the-rich.eu/">taxing the rich</a>…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been working on Oddmu again. My goal is to be able to reproduce the <a href="https://campaignwiki.org/">Campaign Wiki</a> setup:</p>

<ul>
<li>people can get a &ldquo;space&rdquo; for their site by signing up in some way</li>
<li>they can make changes to the look and feel of their site (change the headers, footers, colours, i.e. make changes to both the HTML template and the CSS)</li>
<li>feeds, list of changes and all that are limited to their site</li>
</ul>

<p>Using Oddmu would also result in the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>sites are no longer publically editable (which isn&rsquo;t a requirement for such spaces like role-playing game campaigns)</li>
</ul>

<p>Oddmu now has the following features:</p>

<ul>
<li>when editing pages in a subdirectory, the <code>index</code> and <code>changes</code> page in the same directory are updated (instead of the root directory)</li>
<li>when HTML templates exist in the same directory, those are used instead of the templates in the root directory (e.g. <a href="oddmu/index">Oddµ</a>)</li>
<li>when uploading a HTML template, it is loaded immediately (no more server restart)</li>
</ul>

<p>Once I had this implemented using a library that watches the filesystem for changes, I realized that I could use the same feature to index new pages. This brings me closer to having online and offline writing feature equivalence: Using the web site to create a page should be equivalent to writing a page elsewhere and uploading it to the site via rsync.
(Offline you can use the <code>oddmu notify</code> command to add links to <code>index</code>, <code>changes</code> and hashtag pages.)</p>

<p>I think I&rsquo;m getting close!</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Oddµ">#Oddµ</a></p>

<p>Also, code complexity is through the roof, now. All the global maps aren&rsquo;t thread-safe so they need mutexes. There&rsquo;s a weird Heisenbug I have where I run the test suite and then <code>view.html</code> is gone. The next test run then fails, of course. Thinking it was related to the order of tests, I started running <code>go test -shuffle on</code> and found a plethora of <em>other</em> bugs. And I&rsquo;ve seen at least two occasions where I noticed the disappearing <code>view.html</code> bug, noted the shuffle id, reran the test with that id, got the error again, tried for a third time, and then tests passed. So… it must be a race condition of some sort.</p>

<p>How aggravating.</p>

<p>Maybe something got lost, with that last set of changes.</p>

<p>I do feel, however, that I&rsquo;ve found a lot of bugs… Just now, for example, to help prevent Oddmu from showing any directories or files with a path segment starting with a period…</p>

<p><strong>2024-02-14</strong>. I need to think about an archive handler that allows you to get a zip file for the current directory. (I guess zip files are more accessible than .tar.gz files? Like, for Windows and macOS…</p>

<p>And the archive needs to take <a href="2024-02-14-oddmu-bug">ODDMU_FILTER</a> into account!</p>

<p>Done. ✔️</p>

## 2024-02-14 Oddµ bug maybe

date: 2024-02-14, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1>2024-02-14 Oddµ bug maybe</h1>

<p>I had a site where an entire subdirectory was private. Nobody but the author could read or write those pages. I had configured Apache to require authentication for this subdirectory.</p>

<p>The config looked a bit like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;LocationMatch &quot;^/(edit|save|add|append|upload|drop|view/secret)/&quot;&gt;
  AuthType Basic
  AuthName &quot;Password Required&quot;
  AuthUserFile /home/oddmu/.htpasswd
  Require valid-user
&lt;/LocationMatch&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Note the addition of <code>view/secret</code>.</p>

<p>But yesterday I realized that you can run a search in the root. Such a search includes all the pages in subdirectories, and so Oddmu served an extract of the pages in the &ldquo;secret&rdquo; subdirectory. Adding <code>|search/secret</code> to the <code>LocationMatch</code> doesn&rsquo;t help.</p>

<p>I had to decide whether to disable search all together, or disable the search of subdirectories, or add a new feature.</p>

<p>I added a new feature.</p>

<p>It is tied to an environment variable called <code>ODDMU_FILTER</code>. It matches the directory being searched and the directory where the search starts. If the directory doesn&rsquo;t match, the pages returned must also not match; if the directory does match, the pages returned must also match.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an example of three pages:</p>

<ul>
<li>/a</li>
<li>/public/b</li>
<li>/secret/c</li>
</ul>

<p>The environment variable is set: <code>ODDMU_FILTER=^secret/</code> – what happens now?</p>

<ul>
<li>If you search from the root (doesn&rsquo;t match the filter), then only pages a and b are searched (they also don&rsquo;t match the filter).</li>
<li>If you search from /public (doesn&rsquo;t match the filter), then only page b is searched  (also doesn&rsquo;t match the filter). This behaviour is unchanged from before. Searches start with the directory the user is looking at.</li>
<li>If you search from /secret (matches the filter), then only page c is searched (also matches the filter). This, too, is unchanged from before.</li>
</ul>

<p>Naturally, you still need to change to the web server config for the actual authentication to happen:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;LocationMatch &quot;^/(edit|save|add|append|upload|drop|view/secret|search/secret)/&quot;&gt;
  AuthType Basic
  AuthName &quot;Password Required&quot;
  AuthUserFile /home/oddmu/.htpasswd

## Mozilla downsizes as it refocuses on Firefox and AI

date: 2024-02-13, from: OS News

Specifically, Mozilla plans to scale back its investment in a number of products, including its VPN, Relay and, somewhat remarkably, its Online Footprint Scrubber, which launched only a week ago. Mozilla will also shut down Hubs, the 3D virtual world it launched back in 2018, and scale back its investment in its mozilla.social Mastodon instance. The layoffs will affect roughly 60 employees. Bloomberg previously reported the layoffs. Going forward, the company said in an internal memo, Mozilla will focus on bringing “trustworthy AI into Firefox.” To do so, it will bring together the teams that work on Pocket, Content and AI/Ml. ↫ Frederic Lardinois for TechCrunch I&#8217;d like to remind everyone that I&#8217;ve been warning the Linux world about the precarious, uncertain future of Firefox for years now. The single most important desktop Linux application is in a death spiral and entirely dependent on free Google money. Not a good base to work from. With today&#8217;s news, I only feel strengthened in my conviction that the major desktop projects in the Linux world need to come together in a serious manner to discuss the establishment of a browser project optimised for Linux. Pick an engine, let the GNOME and KDE developers build a native UI on top, and take matters into your own hands. If you can build the two best desktop environments in desktop computing today, you can build a first-class browser together. This is existential.

## Microsoft is bringing Copilot “AI” to Notepad for Windows 11

date: 2024-02-13, from: OS News

Microsoft plans to make Copilot AI inseparable from Windows. After releasing Copilot for Windows 11 and 10 and adding it to Microsoft apps, you can now use Copilot AI in Notepad to get simplified explanations. You can install the Notepad app update via the Microsoft Store to use this feature, but remember, it only works in Dev or Canary channels. Notepad version 11.2401.25.0 adds the “Explain with Copilot” option in its context menu. After highlighting a chunk of text (sentences, code snippets, etc), right-click and select the “Explain with Copilot” option. Or you can press the Ctrl + E shortcut to invoke this feature. ↫ Abhishek Mishra I wonder if you could replace this new, butchered Notepad with a an older, working copy.

## FreeBSD 15, 16 to end support for 32 bit platforms

date: 2024-02-13, from: OS News

FreeBSD is deprecating 32-bit platforms over the next couple of major releases. We anticipate FreeBSD 15.0 will not include the armv6, i386, and powerpc platforms, and FreeBSD 16.0 will not include armv7. Support for executing 32-bit binaries on 64-bit kernels will be retained through at least the lifetime of the stable/16 branch if not longer. (There is currently no plan to remove support for 32-bit binaries on 64-bit kernels.) ↫ John Baldwin on freebsd-announce I don&#8217;t think this is too egregious of a timeline, but there&#8217;s always someone with some weird edge case that gets bit hard by deprecations like these.

## Running UNIX on a Nintendo Entertainment System

date: 2024-02-13, from: OS News

Who wouldn’t want to run a UNIX-like operating system on their NES or Famicom? Although there’s arguably no practical reason for doing so, decrazyo has cobbled together a working port of Little Unix (LUnix), which was originally written for the Commodore 64 and 128 by Daniel Dallmann. The impetus for this project was initially curiosity, but when decrazyo saw that someone had already written a UNIX-like OS for the 6502 processor, it seemed apparent that the NES was too similar to the C64 to not port it. ↫ Maya Posch for Hackaday This is peak computing.

But, as Keith Olbermann spells out so well in his latest <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/garland-must-stop-hurs-plans-to-testify-to-house-gop-2-13-24/id1633301179?i=1000645128033">Countdown</a>, if he were to step aside that would basically concede the election to Trump. So if you think the old man is being silly and vain, well, he's being a lot smarter than you are, and btw, paying a huge price. If you live to be 81, I bet the last thing you want to do, after the life he's had, is to be in this position. We should get behind him, and tell him so, let him know we don't want anyone else, and we want him to be happy, healthy and know that the smart, good people of the US appreciate what he's doing for all of us.

## How to get the retro WordArt back in Microsoft Word

date: 2024-02-13, from: OS News

Graphic design is my passion so naturally I love the vintage, 1990s WordArt. This was a feature in Microsoft Word that allowed you to create timeless “3D” renderings of any text you wanted. It was perfection, but for some reason Microsoft overhauled the feature in the late 2000s, basically ruining it.  These are a soulless simulacrum of the WordArt of yore. The true WordArt remains, however, embedded deep in the code of Microsoft Word itself. But some things that should not have been forgotten were lost. History became legend. Legend became myth. And for twenty years WordArt passed out of all knowledge.&#160; But it can be found again. ↫ Justin Pot at Popular Science I had no idea this stuff was still in there, but I guess it makes sense &#8211; people absolutely adored this stuff, and it was all over the place for a very long time. You would see it in restaurants, hotels, schools, stores, everywhere &#8211; from high-end, luxury places to bargain basements. Now that I think about it, I&#8217;m not at all surprised it&#8217;s still accessible.

## CAP-X and COMP-X: how the Tandy Pocket Computers got a sucky Japanese assembler

date: 2024-02-13, from: OS News

I grew up primarily with the Commodore 64, where if you wanted to do anything really cool and useful, you had to do it in 6502 assembly language. Today I still write 6502 assembly, plus some Power ISA and even a little TMS9900. I like assembly languages and how in control of the CPU you feel writing in one. But you know what would make me not like an assembly language? One that was contrived and not actually the CPU it was running on. And you know what would make me like it even less? If it were kneecapped, convoluted and limited without even proper I/O facilities. ↫ Old Vintage Computing Research Everything you ever wanted to know about CAP-X and COMP-X.

## Firehouse Five and the Cinderella Surprise

date: 2024-02-13, from: Cobel Sasser's blog

My goal was to preserve some never-before-heard recordings of an incredible Dixieland jazz band made up of mostly Disney employees, the Firehouse Five Plus Two. But along the way, I accidentally discovered an incredible lost song that was cut from Walt Disney&#8217;s Cinderella. And you&#8217;re about to hear it too. Let&#8217;s go. Firehouse Five Plus [&#8230;]

## “People don’t quit bad jobs, they quit bad bosses”: How journalists evaluate newsroom leadership

In the first weeks of my first job in journalism, the editor-in-chief stormed into the newsroom, furious — the photo editor had not photographed the event that he had planned the front page around. He stood before her, red-faced and yelling, before grabbing a copy of the AP Stylebook off a nearby table and throwing...

## How an ethic of care can heal the harms of journalism

This newsletter is almost four years old, and during that time we have chronicled again and again how research has shown how deeply frustrated many consumers are with news as it exists today.

## How NASA Uses Simple Technology to Track Lunar Missions

date: 2024-02-13, from: NASA breaking news

NASA is using a simple but effective technology called Laser Retroreflective Arrays (LRAs) to determine the locations of lunar landers more accurately. They will be attached to most of the landers from United States companies as part of NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Service (CLPS) initiative. LRAs are inexpensive, small, and lightweight, allowing future lunar orbiters [&#8230;]

This is what I imagine we all yearn for, for someone to really know us before we die. Okay if it can't be other people, at least let it be a machine. Something like preserving a brain. Wouldn't it be great to know that when you're gone, the essential you, even if it doesn't include your consciousness, persists? You could visit a person like you visit a website. This is just evolutionary, and it's obviously going to happen.

## On climbing and design

date: 2024-02-13, from: Manu - I write blog

<p>I don’t climb, I am not a climber, I don’t have interest in becoming one. I do happen to have a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ivanmoreale/">brother</a> though. And he’s a climber. And if you know anything about climbers is that they’re a bit obsessed with the sport. And as a result of that I’m becoming a climber by proximity. I have absolutely no intention of practicing the sport but I do enjoy watching it as a sport and I also enjoy consuming content related to it. Mainly because climbers climb in gorgeous places and I love nature. Anyway my brother also happens to be a graphic designer and it was only a matter of time before the two things collided. Well, it finally happened: <a href="https://621.design">621.design</a></p>
<figure class="m-o" data-template="with"><div class="m-m"><img class="img" loading="lazy" src="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/on-climbing-and-design/c7954b39fd-1707814510/621.jpg" style="aspect-ratio:1000 / 1333"></div></figure>
<p>The first series of climbing inspired t-shirts are available to be purchased after WAY TOO LONG! I’m already tired of hearing about this project but I’m happy that they’re finally out in the wild. Just to be clear, I am not involved with this. I’m just doing my part and let you know that these exist because who knows, maybe some of you out there are into climbing.</p>
<p>Now, I do have one of those T-shirts sitting on my desk this very moment. It’s the <a href="https://621.design/products/climb">Climb</a>, size L. If you want it, you can sign up to my <a href="https://ko-fi.com/manuelmoreale">One a Month</a> and then send me a message. I’m gonna send it to the first one who claims it and will throw in something else at random in the package. No drugs I promise you. I might add a book in there or maybe a stick from the woods. Still don’t know but there’s going to be something.</p>
<p>Anyway, <a href="https://621.design">621.design</a>, also on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/621.design/">Instagram </a>. Go tell my brother that these took WAY TOO LONG to come out.</p>

<p>Not really pleased with how today&rsquo;s scene is going. I feel like I had good ideas for it two weeks ago, but I didn&rsquo;t write it then, because I still hadn&rsquo;t finished the previous scenes 😖 Now I&rsquo;m scrambling a bit – &ldquo;Oh, this bit of dialogue was in it, right?&rdquo; and it just doesn&rsquo;t feel cohesive.

## Ed Pentz accepts the 2024 NISO Miles Conrad Award

date: 2024-02-13, from: Crossref Blog

<p>Great news to share: our Executive Director, Ed Pentz, has been selected as the 2024 recipient of the Miles Conrad Award from the USA&rsquo;s National Information Standards Organization (NISO). The award is testament to an individual&rsquo;s lifetime contribution to the information community, and we couldn&rsquo;t be more delighted that Ed was voted to be this year&rsquo;s well-deserved recipient.</p>
<div class="shortcode-divwrap align-right">
<span><figure><img src="https://www.crossref.org/images/staff/ed17-720px.png" width="100%"/>
</figure>
</span>
</div>
<p>During the <a href="https://niso.plus" target="_blank">NISO Plus conference</a> this week in Baltimore, USA, Ed accepted his award and delivered the 2024 Miles Conrad lecture, reflecting on how far open scholarly infrastructure has come, and the part he has played in this at Crossref and through numerous other collaborative initiatives.</p>
<p>Established in 1965, the Miles Conrad Award gives recognition to those who&rsquo;ve made substantial contributions to the information community over a lifetime. Named after the founder of the National Federation of Abstracting and Indexing Services (NFAIS)—an association that since merged with NISO—the award encourages innovation in content management and dissemination. Over the years, leaders and innovators who have significantly influenced the field of information exchange have been honored with the award. Ed has joined <a href="https://www.niso.org/awards/MCA" target="_blank">an illustrious group</a>!</p>
<p>Ed’s leadership in collaboration and diplomacy has led to Crossref&rsquo;s success in making research objects more accessible and useful to a wide global audience, including publishers, researchers, funders, societies, libraries, and more. Crossref&rsquo;s founding purpose is stated as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“To promote the development and cooperative use of new and innovative technologies to speed and facilitate scientific and other scholarly research”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Acknowledging his privilege as a Western, university-educated, white man, which he comments has helped his career, Ed prioritises collaboration, open communication, teamwork, and equity in creating a positive, trusted environment that has brought together a diverse team of 49 colleagues from 11 countries. The organisation’s culture allows everyone to grow and contribute to the mission of a connected <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/research-nexus">research nexus</a> by including and developing solutions for community members across the globe.</p>
<p>Before his journey with Crossref, Ed held a number of roles at Harcourt Brace, including launching Academic Press&rsquo;s first online journal. This experience led to his involvement with the DOI-X pilot project, which became the foundation for Crossref. Since its launch in 2000, under his leadership, Crossref has become an important component of the research ecosystem, an open scholarly infrastructure with nearly 20,000 members across more than 150 countries. Crossref is now the main source of &gt;155 million records about all kinds of research objects and this open metadata registry is relied upon by thousands of tools and services across the whole research system.</p>
<p>Ed’s influence is also evident throughout the wider world of open scholarly infrastructure; aside from establishing Crossref, he co-founded <a href="https://ror.org/" target="_blank">ROR</a> and was a founding member of <a href="https://orcid.org/" target="_blank">ORCID</a>, where he also served as board Chair. Further, he has engaged with the community by holding various advisory positions, including the <a href="https://www.doi.org/" target="_blank">DOI Foundation</a>, the Digital Object Naming Authority (DONA), and the Coalition for Diversity in Scholarly Publishing (C4DISC).</p>
<p>Ed also emphasised that the long-term success of community initiatives lies in patience and the ability to agree on high-level principles of purpose and governance, which oil the wheels of collaboration, encourage participation, and enable more progressive change that builds and lasts over time. He says, &ldquo;to solve collective problems it takes collaboration and diplomacy, bringing together a group of stakeholders, balancing their different concerns, building trust, and reaching consensus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The adoption of the <a href="https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org" target="_blank">Principles of Open Scholarly Infrastructure (POSI)</a>, along with (so far) 14 other organisations, was a key <a href="https://www.crossref.org/categories/posi/">turning point for Crossref</a>, Ed said, and one which has already paved the way for more openness of key metadata for the community, including references and retractions, as well as closer partnerships with many of the other POSI adoptees, given their shared understanding and experience.</p>
<p>Referencing the current &ldquo;peak hype&rdquo; around artificial intelligence (AI), Ed points to the challenge of research integrity and the &ldquo;growing field of science sleuthing&rdquo; as a forthcoming area that Crossref and open metadata may help tackle at scale, including through Crossref&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.crossref.org/categories/research-integrity">Integrity of the Scholarly Record (ISR) Program</a> and&mdash;of course&mdash;community-wide collaboration.</p>
<p>In concluding his talk, Ed describes his hopes and dreams for scholarly communications in the future. He would like to see more balance in diversity in the leadership of open scholarly infrastructure, extended integrations among the various foundational infrastructures, and a fully connected system where the scholarly record is inclusive globally.</p>
<h4 id="ed-on-behalf-of-all-your-proud-colleagues-at-crossref-thank-you-and-congratulations">Ed, on behalf of all your proud colleagues at Crossref, thank you and congratulations!</h4>

## Just give me some truth

date: 2024-02-12, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I just found myself writing in a <a href="https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/C3RBrhlJfgb">tweet on Threads</a> that the news industry has contempt for its readers that AI tools don't have. </p>
<p>Actually the AIs also have a way better attitude about the truth than Wikipedia does (yes I know Wikipedia is a Ouija board, that the very worst people control).</p>
<p>We weren't worried about the rise of fascism and the destruction of our ecology, but we were worried about preserving jobs for supposed truth-tellers who think we deserve garbage and don't disappoint. </p>

**@Jessica Smith's blog** (date: 2024-02-12, from: Jessica Smith's blog)

<p>A couple of weeks ago, I was chatting with one of my Idist friends, and I was venting about one of my brothers-in-law, who is insufferable. They asked me, &ldquo;In English, do you also say &lsquo;brother-in-law&rsquo; for those men who think they know everything, but in fact they just parrot what they hear, mostly antiquated, masculinist ideas? In Spain we call such men &lsquo;cuñados&rsquo;, even when they&rsquo;re not literally our brothers-in-law&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I was like, &ldquo;omg no, I&rsquo;ve never heard that in English, but that&rsquo;s brilliant. I love it!&rdquo; It is a <em>perfect</em> description of this brother-in-law, that&rsquo;s for sure. Clearly, insufferable brothers-in-law are a phenomenon that transcends borders.</p>

Launching in spring 2024, the two small satellites of the agency’s PREFIRE mission will fill in missing data from Earth’s polar regions. Two new miniature NASA satellites will start crisscrossing Earth’s atmosphere in a few months, detecting heat lost to space. Their observations from the planet’s most bone-chilling regions will help predict how our ice, [&#8230;]

## AI adoption in newsrooms presents “a familiar power imbalance” between publishers and platforms, new report finds

date: 2024-02-12, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

## Six months in, journalist-owned tech publication 404 Media is profitable

date: 2024-02-12, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

Until January, most stories from 404 Media were available to read for free. But after the four cofounders discovered — through their own reporting — that their stories were being scraped, paraphrased by AI text &#8220;spinners,&#8221; and published on other websites, they decided to start requiring readers to provide their email addresses to access stories,...

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-02-12, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

The SuperBowl last night was an excellent sports game. I didn't like all the bullshit, but it was good sport. However it's all about gambling. I bet it's ruining a lot of lives. A way of sucking the last pennies from people who are already struggling. And it's so easy, just get an app for your phone, add your credit card, and give them all your money.

## Housekeeping

date: 2024-02-12, from: Manu - I write blog

<p>First housekeeping post of 2024. Hope you all had a great beginning of the year. As usual, a couple of things in no particular order:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://peopleandblogs.com">People and Blogs</a> is about to hit 25 interviews. There’s 52 weeks in a year so we’re almost half way through year one. I’m happy to see that people are enjoying the series. Makes me so happy.</li>
<li>Running Minimalissimo is fun. I’ve already coded a few things for the site—a <a href="https://minimalissimo.com/articles/books-and-a-new-navigation">new navigation</a>, a new <a href="https://minimalissimo.com/articles/stream">stream</a> section and also a new books page—and I have plenty of other things I want to do.</li>
<li>My <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/one-a-month">one a month experiment</a> is a tiny success. Kind people are still out there and I think it’s important to try support a more sane web in a sustainable way.</li>
<li>I’m hosting the <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/indieweb-carnival-digital-relationships">IndieWeb Carnival this month</a>. You can find the first 15 submissions at the link above and you have time until February 28th to send yours.</li>
<li>I’m redesigning my blog. It’s not a true redesign, it will feel very familiar if you visited this site over the past 5 or 6 years. Structure will stay pretty much the same but I felt the need to tweak a few things here and there. I’m also going to reintroduce a web font. I was in my 20s the last time I used one on this site. Gonna be fun.</li>
</ol>
<p>And that’s all I have for this February housekeeping. As always my inbox is open if you want to get in touch. Have a great day.</p>

If the Supreme Court had an ounce of guts they would say <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-insurrection-14th-amendment-2024-colorado-d16dd8f354eeaf450558378c65fd79a2">this isn't</a> a state matter, it's a federal matter, and we are the federal government, so here's the deal. Trump tried to overthrow the government and he took an oath to protect the government, and therefore the 14th Amendment applies, and he can't be on the ballot anywhere, including Colorado.

## One way is always better than two

date: 2024-02-11, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Most Hacker News threads devolve into people talking about personalities, not about tech stuff. But yesterday's <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39324847">thread</a> about OPML was the rare exception, until someone who says they like me (I guess) said something personal and ugly. </p>
<p>I wonder why after all this time we can't see how pointless it is to have opinions about people, esp online. Everything you hear is passed through someone else's filters, so you're getting a huge dose of their personality along with a sliver of insight into the person they're talking about. </p>
<p>And don't forget to factor in that sometimes when someone has put an <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+interop">obstacle</a> in the way of big companies, you can earn favor inside those companies by scandalizing the person whose work they object to. There was a lot of that happening as RSS crossed paths with some very big and rich companies with lots of employees, and an interest in appearing to interop without the cost of interop.</p>
<p>I've tried to add formats, protocols and software to the mix, always trying to compromise. It's not mentioned in the Wikipedia page on RSS that I had a format that does what RSS does, a year before it existed, but I gave it up so that Netscape and UserLand would build on the same format, RSS. </p>
<p>I didn't invent RSS. I did something much greater, I compromised. We had the leading blogging software at the time, and Netscape had the feeds of four credible news orgs. When you put them together, that turned out to be huge power. We eventually pulled in all of social media and all of professional publishing into one format. Ask anyone who was active at the time. The blogging world adopted RSS in an instant, in 1999 and 2000. And in 2002, when the NYT adopted it, again, in an instant the entire news world all of a sudden all had RSS feeds. You can see it in the steady stream of announcements in the archive of <a href="http://scripting.com/">this blog</a>. </p>
<p>BTW there was someone brilliant at Netscape who saw our compromise and responded with more compromise. Their next version of RSS had some of the features we had left behind in our format. We never asked them to do that, they just figured it out. Collaboration is something that requires two, one person can't collaborate on their own. I know that sounds ridiculous, but sometimes people don't look for the other party who made compromise possible.</p>
<p>I don't think even the people who were closest to it at the time understood the move. And I don't think very many appreciate the power that comes from being the one who throws in the towel on their pet project to attain unity. </p>
<p>One way of doing something is always better than two. That's just a restatement of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle#:~:text=It%20is%20often%20reworded%20as,an%20early%20specification%20of%20TCP.">Postel's Postulate</a>. Be conservative in what you send. </p>
<p>That doesn't just apply to you, it applies to all of us collectively. Every time you add something that already exists we're all going to pay for it. </p>
<p>If you think that saying this makes me <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cantankerous">cantankerous</a> -- well, I say okay -- but you're wrong because it's generous and brilliant to push back when people add complexity. Of course people don't like to hear they're doing something wrong, but when it comes to accumulating complexity debt unnecessarily, well imho you have to listen to that. Complexity is a force against interop. </p>
<p>We should be looking for opportunities to work together to create something greater than anything any one of us can create. </p>

<p>It's not <em>cheap</em>, but it's <em>efficient</em>. At least, that's my hope.</p>

<p>Over the past few months, I worked with a number of vendors to assemble what I <em>hope</em> will make an efficient but high-performance arm64 NAS. In the video embedded below, I've put together the following (some of these links are affiliate links):</p></div>

## Short history of all Windows UI frameworks and libraries

date: 2024-02-11, from: OS News

The official way to create user interfaces for the Windows operating system changed quite a lot of times during the last years. Microsoft created and (partially or fully) abadoned a lot of APIs which where intended to replace the respective previous ones. They changed names and ways how it&#8217;s supposed to be done a few times, and left a lof of developers confused. Here is a small historical overview. ↫ Nikolaus Gebhardt If you&#8217;re ever wondering how we ended up at a situation where, on the desktop and in Explorer, context menus have their own context menus, well, this is why.

## The state of X.org and Wayland in one paragraph

date: 2024-02-11, from: OS News

Wayland and X.org are both part of freedesktop. Whatever maintenance is still happening on X.org is mostly being done by people who primarily work on Wayland. There isn&#8217;t some kind of holy war going on between The Wayland Developers who want to kill X.org, and The X.org Developers who believe it is great and want to keep it. They&#8217;re nearly all the same people, and they all want X.org to die. AFAIK there isn&#8217;t anybody who is actually clamoring to *do the work of maintaining X.org upstream*. There are people who don&#8217;t want it to die because Wayland doesn&#8217;t yet have the features they need or the NVIDIA proprietary driver doesn&#8217;t work well on Wayland or whatever, but AFAIK, none of those people is actually volunteering to maintain X.org long-term. ↫ Adam Williamson There&#8217;s really no clearer summary of the current state of affairs than this.

## Introducing Fedora Atomic Desktops

date: 2024-02-11, from: OS News

We are happy to announce the creation of a new family of Fedora Linux spins: Fedora Atomic Desktops! As Silverblue has grown in popularity, we’ve seen more of our mainline Fedora Linux spins make the jump to offer a version that implements rpm-ostree. It’s reached the point where it can be hard to talk about all of them at the same time. Therefore we’ve introduced a new brand that will serve to simplify how we discuss rpm-ostree and how we name future atomic spins. ↫ Joseph Gayoso for Fedora Magazine You can get pretty much any major desktop environment as an rpm-ostree (inaccurately referred to as &#8216;immutable&#8217;) version of Fedora, so it makes sense to standardise the naming scheme.

## Accidentally making windows vanish in my old-fashioned Unix X environment

date: 2024-02-11, from: OS News

One of the somewhat odd things about my old fashioned X Window System environment is that when I &#8216;iconify&#8217; or &#8216;minimize&#8217; a window, it (mostly) winds up as an actual icon on my root window (what in some environments would be called the desktop), in contrast to the alternate approach where the minimized window is represented in some sort of taskbar. I have strong opinions about where some of these icons should go, and some tools to automatically arrange this for various windows, including the GNU Emacs windows I (now) use for reading email. ↫ Chris Siebenmann Iconification should be possible in any modern desktop environment, and it&#8217;s sad that this paradigm has pretty much entirely vanished. I would love for iconified windows to be treated essentially the same way as files, so you can move them around, drop them inside directories, and even move them from one computer to another (assuming they have the application in question installed). If I&#8217;m working on a project, and I have a bunch of LibreOffice documents, spreadsheets, browser tabs, notes in a text editor, some images open, and so on, I should be able to iconify them all, keep them in the project&#8217;s directory, and de-iconify them as if nothing had ever happened. Right now, you have to use files and application states for that, which is cumbersome and annoying. Sadly, advanced window management is dying. Shame.

**@Jessica Smith's blog** (date: 2024-02-11, from: Jessica Smith's blog)

<p>So, recently I’ve been rereading old journal entries, which is <em>always</em> playing with fire a bit, but this time I decided to try this new thing where I ONLY read the fuckin’ hilarious entries (and the sexy ones, after a certain point) and none of the traumatic ones and oh my god, this way is so much better. There’s so much shit I completely forgot about. Why is it always the bad memories that stick in your mind, and never the good ones! Feeling a bit of nostalgic sorrow now, but still, this has been good fun.</p>

## Review of Chip War by Chris Miller

date: 2024-02-11, from: Stephen Smith's blog

Introduction Last time, Jeff Hortobagyi presented his review of Chip War: The Fight For The World’s Most Critical Technology, Simon and Schuster, 2022 by Chris Miller. I agree with Jeff’s review, but thought I’d add a few observations from my personal experience. I first learned to program in 1976 in grade 10 using a 300 [&#8230;]
