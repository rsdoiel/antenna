I was pretty sure when I took my second guess, but that's just when the cursing started.  By the third guess I thought she's screwing with us! I should not have listened to the podcast.

## MsgFiler 4

Adam Tow (Mastodon): Since WWDC 2023, I was telling long-time MsgFiler customers that I would look into what I could do to support the product in this new era of Apple Mail sans plug-ins.

## Technical writing in 2049

date: 2024-03-17, from: Blog by Fabrizio Ferri-Benedetti

<p>A month ago, Lana Novikova <a href="https://twitter.com/_Unsolved_/status/1758039399684542664">asked me</a> to imagine the future of software documentation. What will software technical writing look like in, say, 2049, when our profession will be a century old? Will we be writing markup in git repositories or use ÜberDITA in space? Will our job still exist? I’ve put my futurist hat on to picture the shape of our profession 25 years from now. Buckle up!</p>

## RISC OS eXperience – 18th May

date: 2024-03-17, from: RiscOS Story

People in the United Kingdom who use RISC OS have plenty of opportunities to meet up with fellow users, with a number of user groups holding meetings on a regular basis, and a small number of main events &#8211; the shows, such as Wakefield and London. But what of our European friends? It&#8217;s possible for them to join some of the user group meetings when they&#8217;re held online and at a suitable time, as many are, but while doing so is an opportunity not to be missed where possible it&#8217;s&#8230;

## Fuzzing Ladybird with tools from Google Project Zero

date: 2024-03-17, from: OS News

While Ladybird does an okay job with well-formed web content, I thought it would be useful to throw some security research tools at it and see what kind of issues it might reveal. So today we’ll be using “Domato”, a DOM fuzzer from Google Project Zero, to stress test Ladybird and fix some issues found along the way. The way this works is that Domato generates randomized web pages with lots of mostly-valid but strange HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I then load these pages into a debug build of Ladybird and observe what happens. ↫ Andreas Kling I have high hopes for Ladybird.

## Passing on at ROUGOL – 18th March

What will happen to your computer gear when you&#8217;re no longer with us? Rather than a guest speaker, the next RISC OS User Group of London (ROUGOL) meeting &#8211; which will take place on 18th March (tomorrow) &#8211; will take the form of an open discussion, with Bernard Boase chairing the meeting. Inspired by a discussion on the Stardot forum entitled&#8216;What happens to your collection when you pass?&#8217;, the aim of the meeting will be to explore the possibilities for what might happen to your computer equipment when you have&#8230;

## WAL-G 3.0.0 released

date: 2024-03-17, from: PostgreSQL News

<p>WAL-G team is happy to announce the release of WAL-G 3.0.0</p>
<p>WAL-G is a tool for archival database restoration for PostgreSQL, GreenplumDB, MySQL/MariaDB, MongoDB, etcd and several other databases.</p>
<h2>Noteworthy Changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Every database engine can now benefit from failover storage. This technique can save the day if one of the storage systems goes down. However, do not forget to monitor them anyway.</li>
<li>For Postgres, we have a WAL archiving daemon available. Its primary purpose is to improve the efficiency of parallel archiving.</li>
<li>Additionally, WAL-G supports the partial restoration of a cluster. If you have large, unnecessary tables, you can exclude them from the restoration process, the Postgres will skip over the WAL records for these tables. See <a href="https://github.com/wal-g/wal-g/blob/master/docs/PostgreSQL.md#partial-restore-experimental">docs</a> for details.</li>
<li>Greenplum's PITR (Point-in-Time Recovery) is undergoing its maturation process. Partial restore is supported in a similar way to Postgres. We now have tools to verify the integrity of AO\AOCS files in storage without actually restoring backups.</li>
</ul>
<p>WAL-G v3.0.0 is available for download on our <a href="https://github.com/wal-g/wal-g/releases">GitHub releases page</a>.</p>
<p>Have a nice day!</p>
