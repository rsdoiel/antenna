## Turn Off The Pillow Machines

date: 2024-06-23, from: Tedium site

Amazon’s plans to shift its packaging strategy points at a new front in the lengthy tug of war between paper and plastic—a war that started in grocery stores.

## Fighting bots

date: 2024-06-23, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>With great timing, a post by Nicolas titled “<a href="https://thejollyteapot.com/2024/06/23/should-i-remove-this-blog-from-google-search">Should I remove this blog from Google Search?</a>” landed in my RSS feed earlier today. I’ve been thinking a lot about the current phase the web is going through, especially after reading all the various news related to Perplexity AI. I don’t think they’re especially bad or wrong in what they’re doing, I’m sure the other companies are equally as bad and they’re also not giving half of a fuck about ingesting whatever they can find if it helps make their products better. They don’t care about book authors, they don’t care about journalists and they for sure don’t care about small personal bloggers.</p>
<p>That brings up the question: what do we do? What even can we do? It’s obvious that robots.txt is no longer an option because most companies don’t even bother checking it. We can try to block the user agents at a server level but they can avoid that by simply sending a generic UA. We could de-list our sites but that would make it very hard for actual users to find our content and I suspect the point of writing for most of us is to share and connect with others. The legal system sure ain’t gonna fix this situation anytime soon. So what’s left? I guess there are only two options left:</p>
<ol>
<li>Accept the fact that some dickheads will do whatever they want because that’s just the world we live in</li>
<li>Make everything private and only allow actual human beings access to our content</li>
</ol>
<p>Both solutions are suboptimal. Reading Nicolas's post made me also think about something else. He wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the case of Perplexity for example, a company that obviously steals content, lies, doesn’t really credit its sources, and — on top of it all — ignores the robots.txt rules from websites. If I were the TechCrunch, the New York Times, and the Financial Times of the world, I would simply stop reporting on the company. Not a blip on the radar, radio silence, except for their next fuck up. And then good luck finding investors if no one talks about you. They had their chance, they blew it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What if Google decided to do that? What if Google decided to not return any result related to a company like Perplexity? I know it’s obviously not going to happen but wouldn’t that be funny?</p>                <hr>
                <p>Thank you for keeping RSS alive. You're awesome.</p>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-06-23, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

There's a new star in the kittyverse, <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/23/wordleKitty.png">Wordle Kitty</a>. I let her do my Wordle-play. Today, she was <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2272846162922776&set=a.113966572144090&type=3&notif_id=1719149825702718&notif_t=feedback_reaction_generic&ref=notif">feeling</a> a little under the weather so Wordle Kitty checked into the town urgent care center where they gave her some medicine which gave her the strength for a “splendid” performance at the days Wordle puzzle. So while she’s feeling a bit ill under it all is a feeling of splendor and the usual over the top cuteness! :-)

## Does personal AI require Big Compute?

date: 2024-06-23, from: Doc Searls (at Harvard), New Old Blog

I don&#8217;t think it does. Not for everything. We already have personal AI for autocomplete. Do we need Big Compute for a personal AI to tell us which pieces within our Amazon orders are in which line items in our Visa statements? (Different items in a shipment often appear inside different charges on a card.) [&#8230;]

## Total Recall

date: 2024-06-23, from: Status-Q blog

The tech news has had a lot of coverage recently of Microsoft&#8217;s proposed &#8216;Recall&#8216; system, which (as a very rough approximation) takes a screenshot of your display every five seconds, and uses their AI-type Copilot system to allow you to search it. &#8220;What was that cafe or restaurant that someone in the call recommended yesterday?&#8221; <a class="more-link excerpt-link" href="https://statusq.org/archives/2024/06/23/12093/">Continue Reading<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right"></span></a>

## Go West

date: 2024-06-23, from: Status-Q blog

We&#8217;ve been away for the last week or so on the south coast of Cornwall, and it was a great trip. We had our folding e-bikes inside the van, and our little boat behind, which meant it wasn&#8217;t always the easiest setup to take along narrow Cornish lanes, especially if we found ourselves needing to <a class="more-link excerpt-link" href="https://statusq.org/archives/2024/06/23/12084/">Continue Reading<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right"></span></a>

## Andrew S. Tanenbaum receives ACM Software System Award

date: 2024-06-23, from: OS News

Andrew S. Tanenbaum, professor emeritus of Computer Science at VU Amsterdam, receives the ACM Software System Award for MINIX, which influenced the teaching of Operating Systems principles to multiple generations of students and contributed to the design of widely used operating systems, including Linux. Tanenbaum created MINIX 1.0 in 1987 to accompany his textbook, Operating Systems: Design and Implementation. MINIX was a small microkernel-based UNIX operating system for the IBM PC, which was popular at the time. It was roughly 12,000 lines of code, and in addition to the microkernel, included a memory manager, file system and core UNIX utility programs. It became free open-source software in 2000. ↫ VU Amsterdam website Definitely a deserved award for Tanenbaum, and it&#8217;s a minuscule bit of pride that VU Amsterdam happens to be my Alma mater. He also wrote an article for OSNews way back in 2006, detailing MINIX 3, which is definitely a cool notch to have on our belt.
