## Scarlett Johansson says she is ‘shocked, angered’ over new ChatGPT voice

date: 2024-05-21, from: OS News

Lawyers for Scarlett Johansson are demanding that OpenAI disclose how it developed an AI personal assistant voice that the actress says sounds uncannily similar to her own. Johansson&#8217;s legal team has sent OpenAI two letters asking the company to detail the process by which it developed a voice the tech company dubbed &#8220;Sky,&#8221; Johansson&#8217;s publicist told NPR in a revelation that has not been previously reported. ↫ Bobby Allyn at NPR This story highlights just how much disdain techbros have for the work of creative people. Here&#8217;s the timeline: Techbros like Sam Altman deeply despise and undervalue the work of creatives, believing human creativity to be merely an equation to be solved, definable by an algorithm. To people like him, creative work has no value, and as such, is up for grabs to be taken and cut up for his algorithms to spit out as &#8220;new&#8221; works. This story highlights this perfectly. The sleaze runs deep with Altman and OpenAI.

## Why Tesla FSD is unsafe

date: 2024-05-21, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/05/21/teslaModelY.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Here's what I've learned from <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+tesla">owing</a> a Tesla Model Y with <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/10/230303.html">Full Self Driving</a>. I don't believe it's safe. It absolutely does require your full attention at all times. You are still driving the car. I've seen it do crazy stuff in simple situations. I've seen it panic, basically throw its hands in the air and say Dave this is your problem. That's why you always have to be ready, as if you were driving the car yourself because at any moment you could be. You never know when it's going to happen. Now focus on that moment. Your car has given up and turned the driving over to you. How much experience do you have with that? Do you know where to look? Do you hit the brakes or veer to the left or right? If you're an experienced driver, a lot of these reactions are completely programmed into the lower levels of the brain. You don't have to think at all. When the car panics, I tend to panic. If I had 10 or 20 years experience with this connection, then I guess it's probably safe. But not the way it is. </p>
<p>I'm amazed there aren't more terrible accidents with FSD, and that Tesla still promotes this as "self-driving," which it is not. </p>
<p>Also, I love my Tesla. Every time I get into that mofo I feel privileged. It looks like a Toyota Camry but drives like a muscle car. I might still switch to a <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/kia/ev9">Kia EV9</a>, at some point, if it drives as well as the Tesla, simply because the nearest Telsa dealer is over an hour away, and the <a href="https://www.romeokia.com/">Kia dealer</a> is in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingston,_New_York">Kingston</a> which is practically in the neighborhood. </p>

## Xeon Phi support removed in GCC 15 compiler

date: 2024-05-20, from: OS News

Last week I wrote about Intel aiming to remove Xeon Phi support in GCC 15 with the products being end-of-life and deprecated in GCC 14. While some openly wondered whether the open-source community would allow it given the Xeon Phi accelerators were available to buy just a few years ago and at some very low prices going back years so some potentially finding use still out of them especially during this AI boom (and still readily available to buy used for around ~$50 USD), today the Intel Xeon Phi support was indeed removed. ↫ Michael Larabel Xeon Phi PCIe cards are incredibly cheap on eBay, and every now and then my mouse hovers over the buy button &#8211; but I always realise just in time that the cards have become quite difficult to use, since support for them, already sparse to begin with, is only getting worse by the day. Support for them was already removed in Linux 5.10, and now GCC is pulling he plug too, so the only option is to keep using old kernels, or pass the card on to a VM running an older Linux kernel version, which is a lot of headache for what is essentially a weird toy for nerds at this point. GCC 15 will also, sadly, remove support for Itanium, which, as I&#8217;ve said before, is a huge disgrace and a grave mistake. Itanium is the future, and will stomp all over crappy architectures like x86 and ARM. With this deprecation, GCC relegates itself to the dustbin of history.

## Modernizing the AntennaPod code structure

date: 2024-05-20, from: OS News

AntennaPod has been around for a long time &#8211; the first bit of code was published in 2011. Since then, the app has grown massively and had several main developers. The beauty of open-source is that so many people can contribute and make a great app together. But sometimes having many people work on a project can lead to different ways of thinking about how to structure the project. Because of this, AntennaPod gradually grew to have a number of weird code constructs. Our latest release, version 3.4, fixes this. ↫ ByteHamster The AntennaPod team had an incredible task ahead of itself, and while it took them a few years, they pulled it off. The code structure graphs from before and after the code restructuring illustrate better than words ever could what they achieved. Thy changed 10000 lines of source code in 62 pull requests for this restructuring alone, while still adding new major features in the meantime. Pretty incredible.

## Microsoft gives Windows new compiler, kernel, scheduler, and x86 translation layer on ARM

date: 2024-05-20, from: OS News

Microsoft&#8217;s developer conference Build is taking place this week, so there&#8217;s been some major Windows news and announcements, and for once &#8211; we&#8217;re not talking about more ads in your operating system, or even &#8220;AI&#8221; shoehorned into, I don&#8217;t know, Phone Dialer or Windows Fax and Scan. First and foremost, Windows is going to get a new compiler, kernel, and scheduler, but despite such massive low-level changes, the marketing version number won&#8217;t jump from 11 to 12. Of course, we all know the marketing version number has nothing to do with the actual Windows NT version number, which currently sits at 10. The Windows NT version number, meanwhile, is actually also meaningless, since it magically jumps around left and right too, going from 6.2 to 10 between Windows 8.1 and Windows 10, where it has stayed ever since. &#8220;We really focused on modernizing this update of Windows 11,&#8221; said Microsoft Corporate Vice President of Windows and Devices Pavan Davuluri at a technical briefing on Microsoft&#8217;s campus in mid-April. &#8220;We engineered this update of Windows 11 with a real focus on AI inference and taking advantage of the Arm64 instruction set at every layer of the operating system stack. For us, what this meant really was building a new compiler in Windows. We built a new kernel in Windows on top of that compiler. We now have new schedulers in the operating system that take advantage of these new SoC architecture.&#8221; ↫ Andrew Cunningham at Ars Technica The focus is clearly on ARM here, which coincides with the launch of Qualcomm&#8217;s Snapdragon X Elite, a new SoC that finally seems to truly make ARM laptops that aren&#8217;t from Apple a real, competitive thing &#8211; so much so that Qualcomm is even breaking with tradition and taking Linux support very seriously for this new chip. Microsoft also unveiled the name for its new x86 translation layer for Windows on ARM: Prism. Microsoft told Ars Technica that Prism is as fast as Apple&#8217;s Rosetta 2, which is interesting because Apple&#8217;s M series chips contain special silicon to speed up the translation process, making me wonder if Qualcomm has done the same, or is just brute-forcing it. Performance like this means the apps customers love work great. Microsoft has partnered closely with developers across the globe to optimize their applications for this processor. In addition, the powerful new Prism emulation engine delivers a 2x performance boost compared to Surface Pro 9 with 5G. On the new Surface Pro and Surface Laptop, powered by Snapdragon X Elite and Snapdragon X Plus processors, experiences like Adobe Creative Cloud, Microsoft 365 and Chrome will feel snappy, quick and responsive. ↫ Pete Kyriacou on the Windows blog The new Windows on ARM machines using the Snapdragon X Elite will be marketed under the new Copilot+ brand name, which brings with it some requirements, the biggest of which is the neural processing unit: it must be capable of at least 40 trillion operations per second. At the time of writing, the only Windows-capable processor that can boast such numbers is, of course, the new Snapdragon X Elite. AMD and Intel need not apply. They simply cannot match this. Microsoft tied a bow on all this stuff by unveiling the new Surface Pro and new Surface Laptop, both powered by the new Snapdragon SoCs. You can preorder them today, but they won&#8217;t be available until 18 June.

## A post I wrote on Twitter

date: 2024-05-20, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Here's <a href="https://x.com/davewiner/status/1792237882679156983">something</a> you may find funny if you study the evolution of software technology.</p>
<ol>
<li>In the 80s there were all kinds of ideas about how to do hypertext. Mostly they called for two-way links, so you could walk the graph in any direction you like. These were hard to implement and required the two parties work with each other, and that never happened. </li>
<li>In the early 90s along comes Tim Berners-Lee, a random NextStep developer who wanted to play and he for whatever reason didn't wait to figure out how to boil the ocean with two-way links, he just did one-way links and instead of inventing a new protocol he just implemented it on top of TCP/IP. While the purists were debating its purity it took off, broke all records, made a lot of people very rich.</li>
<li>A few years later, Tim Berners-Lee, the same guy who made the web, wants to layer a new protocol on top of the web -- the Semantic Web. He wanted people to be able to query the web the way you query a database. "show me all the widgets on sale in urbana for less than $20." Like that.</li>
<li>It never happened for the same reason the two-way hyperlinks didn't, it required cooperation. You couldn't just throw together a demo in an afternoon as a fun side project like you could with the web (I speak from experience, my first success with the web took five freaking minutes). </li>
<li>Now when Google or some other browser maker integrates ChatGPT-like functionality in their browser, as a side-effect, you will get TBL's Semantic Web. It won't require any cooperation and that's why it will work.</li>

## iOS 17.5 Resurfacing Deleted Photos

Juli Clover: A Reddit user wiped an iPad following Apple&#8217;s guidelines in September of 2023 before selling it off to a friend. That friend updated the iPad to iPadOS 17.5 this week, and began seeing the Reddit user&#8217;s old photos reappearing in the Photos app. That would be very concerning because it would imply that [&#8230;]

## KDE Plasma 6 comes to OpenBSD

date: 2024-05-20, from: OS News

Last year marked a significant milestone for both myself and the OpenBSD desktop community, as we successfully ported KDE Plasma 5 and all dependencies to OpenBSD. With the release of OpenBSD 7.5 on April 5, 2024, KDE Plasma in version 5.27.10 has become a part of our lovely operating system. This success is the result of years of development work and commitment to achieving this goal. KDE launched version 6 of its Plasma desktop environment on February 28, 2024, bringing numerous updates and features as well as the major switch to Qt6. I am immensely proud that the OpenBSD team has managed to prepare for this major update so swiftly. All necessary components have been committed to our CVS tree, and the packages will soon be available. ↫ Rafael Sadowski Excellent news for OpenBSD users who don&#8217;t wish to be using GNOME, Xfce, or one of the smaller build-it-yourself desktop environments. My dual-Xeon workstation, which I switched over from Fedora KDE to OpenBSD, runs Xfce, because I feel a smaller desktop environment is a more natural fit for OpenBSD, but I&#8217;m very happy to know that I have KDE to fall back on in case Xfce turns out not to be a good fit for me in the long term. I&#8217;ll give the OpenBSD developers an other experts in that community some more time to iron out any wrinkles, and then I&#8217;ll probably give it a go to see just how well KDE will be integrated with the OpenBSD base system.

## Windows Server 2025 to ship with DTrace by default

date: 2024-05-20, from: OS News

Windows Server 2025 comes equipped with dtrace as a native tool. DTrace is a command-line utility that enables users to monitor and troubleshoot their system&#8217;s performance in real-time. DTrace allows users to dynamically instrument both the kernel and user-space code without any need to modify the code itself. This versatile tool supports a range of data collection and analysis techniques, such as aggregations, histograms, and tracing of user-level events. To learn more, see DTrace for command line help and DTrace on Windows for additional capabilities. ↫ What&#8217;s new in Windows Server 2025 DTrace was originally developed by Sun as part of Solaris, but eventually made its way to other operating systems as Sun collapsed in on itself and Oracle gave it the final push. DTrace is available for the various surviving Solars-based operating systems, Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, macOS, and QNX, and Microsoft ported DTrace from FreeBSD to Windows back in 2018. With Windows Server 2025, DTrace will be shipped out of the box.

## pg_dumpbinary v2.17 released

date: 2024-05-20, from: PostgreSQL News

<p><strong>Grenoble, France - Mai 20, 2024</strong></p>
<h2>pg_dumpbinary</h2>
<p><code>pg_dumpbinary</code> dumps a PostgreSQL database to a binary format. The resulting dump must be restored
using <code>pg_restorebinary</code>, which is provided.</p>
<p>This release adds two new options to command pg_restorebinary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add option <code>-C, --create</code> to pg_restorebinary to create the database
  before restoring into it. Like with pg_restore you must provide a
  database to connect using the <code>-d</code> option.</li>
<li>Add <code>--dump-create</code> to print to stdout the create and alter database
  statements.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>pg_dumpbinary</code> is useful when:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have bytea that can not be exported by <code>pg_dump</code> because the
  total size of the escape/hex output exceeds 1Gb.</li>
<li>You have custom type that stores <code>\0</code> internally in bytea but data
  are exported by pg_dump as char/varchar/text.  In this case pg_dump
  truncates all data after the first <code>\0</code>, resulting in data loss.</li>
<li>Other cases where a binary output format is useful.</li>
</ul>
<p>In these kinds of cases <code>pg_dumpbinary</code> helps by dumping the
PostgreSQL database in a binary format. In all other cases
the pg_dump/pg_restore commands distributed with PostgreSQL are
preferred.</p>
<p>See the documentation for a more complete description of available
features.</p>
<h2>Links &amp; Credits</h2>
<p>pg_dumpbinary is an Open Source project from <a href="https://www.lzlabs.com/">LzLabs GmbH</a>.  Contributions and ideas are
welcome. Send your ideas, features requests, or patches using GitHub's tools.</p>

<p>Let’s get the obvious question out the way first: “why?” And I, errr, don’t have a good reason. It’s <a href="/blog/2021/5/3/visiting-the-eu/">not the first time</a> I’ve done a big themed running project, but it’s by far the biggest I’ve <em>ever</em> done.</p>
<p>Second obvious question: “was it a good idea?” Kinda… I really enjoyed running through a lot of the countryside, and for the most part the Thames Path is very easy to run on. It’s also mostly well connected with public transport, which makes the point-to-point nature of the runs manageable. But on the other hand I often spent far more time travelling than running, which made it a much larger time commitment than “just” 20 weekend half marathons.</p>
<p>The best part of this project was seeing the contrast in landscapes and communities across the length of the river. Until now my only familiarity with the Thames was with its murky, curvy path through London or the college boathouses in Oxford.</p>

     alt="Near Henley-on-Thames" />
<figcaption>

</figure>
<p>An interesting historical pattern with the Thames — as with <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/713101">many English cities</a> — is that effluence flows downstream and affluence upstream. A lot of this has to do with the Thames’s role in London’s history: for centuries waste water was literally dumped in the river. Land up river became more desirable. It’s no historical accident that the royal court at Hampton Court Palace was far west of the City of London.</p>
<p>Those historical trends are reflected today, even as sewage practices have improved (<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-67357566">a little</a>) and London de-industrialised. House prices are twice as high in Richmond-upon-Thames in south-west London than Bexley, in south-east London. Further out of London, on an Essex-bound train I overheard a group of men lamenting the loss of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_men%27s_club">working men’s clubs</a>, an important <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_place">third place</a> in their communities, whilst in Oxfordshire I sat near a <em>frightfully</em> posh former Home Secretary concluding with a group of friends that taking the train to a party was a “terrifically smart” decision. (Decisions they made in government weren’t quite so clever.)</p>
<p>Deeper into the country the Thames cuts a path through “green and pleasant” English countryside. Over the course of my 20 runs I developed a newfound appreciation for it. I’ve genuinely come to believe that we’re <em>incredibly</em> fortunate in the UK to be so well connected to so much accessible, open space.</p>

<h2 id="2024-05-19-running-the-river-thamesgear">Gear</h2>
<p>I ran with a running vest, a 1.5L Osprey water bladder, a handful of snacks (Clif bars in particular), gels, AirPods, iPhone, and Apple Watch Ultra. I experimented with cheaper water bladders but they’re a false economy: after a few runs they’d start to leak and I’d have to replace them.</p>

<figcaption>
Pedometer++ on Apple Watch Ultra
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The Watch was the MVP of all these: I used <a href="https://pedometer.app">Pedometer++</a> to display my planned route and route taken throughout each run. The app supports both OpenStreetMap and Ordnance Survey tiles; I generally preferred the former as they were clearer on the small display.</p>
<p>For the most part I was following the Thames Path, but I often deviated around it to either explore other countryside or take shortcuts on routes that would otherwise be too long in one go.</p>
<h2 id="2024-05-19-running-the-river-thamesconditions">Conditions</h2>
<p>I ran mostly in winter and spring 2023 and spring 2024. In the winter months the path was often <em>very</em> muddy, whilst in spring there were sections with very overgrown grass (which was joyless with my hayfever). The Thames burst its banks last year, flooding parts of the path. The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/river-thames-restrictions-and-closures">Environment Agency has pages monitoring current river conditions</a>.</p>
<p>Towards the source of the river the Thames Path is often just a trodden path along the edge of fields. This makes for a very uneven surface: I had to slow down to avoid turning an ankle.</p>
<p>I only ran in the summer once, but even in spring it was often 20º+ and sunny. Most of the route is <em>very</em> exposed: by the end I regularly ran with a baseball cap.</p>
<h2 id="2024-05-19-running-the-river-thameslogistics">Logistics</h2>
<p>I live in London, which made travel to and from each run easy. (Cities in the UK are well connected by rail to London and <em>far</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beeching_cuts">less well to one another</a>.) All in I spent about £400 on train tickets, local buses, and (only twice) taxis. I used a railcard to decrease costs but otherwise I generally optimised for time. I’ve no doubt that booking advance singles, split tickets, or cheaper train lines could reduce the cost by at least £100.</p>
<p>At the end of each run I made a tradition of buying a meal deal (or equivalent) and extra snacks: I spent a further £200 on these.</p>
<p>Between Lechlade, Gloucestershire and Teddington, London the Thames is interrupted by dozens of locks. These locks often have extra facilities for boaters, which <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/river-thames-locks-and-facilities-for-boaters">the Environment Agency lists here</a>. I learned way, way too late (literally at the <em>last</em> lock I ran past) that this often includes drinking water taps that you can use to refill water bottles. A lock keeper recommended running the tap for 30s before using it.</p>
<p>I’ve posted GPX files for all the routes below.</p>

<p>For all the London and Kent routes I took South Western trains, TfL services, or High Speed 1.</p>
<p>The best sections were from Battersea Power Station to Greenwich: you get far more diversity in the built environment on this leg than any other section of the Thames (beyond these points London is mostly just suburbs).</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/gpx/The_Thames_1_N_Teddington_Lock_to_Barnes_Bridge.gpx">[1/20] Teddington to Barnes Bridge (12.7km)</a>: I started by running west with one of the shortest runs. All of the London sections were very flexible as the Thames path is rarely more than a few hundred meters from a TfL connection. Teddington is the final lock on the River Thames and therefore the start of the “tidal Thames”.</li>
<li><a href="/gpx/The_Thames_2_N_Barnes_Bridge_to_Tower_Bridge.gpx">[2/20] Barnes Bridge to Tower Bridge (21.2km)</a>: By far the busiest section as it includes the Southbank. Stopped at Battersea Power Station halfway.</li>

<li><a href="/gpx/The_Thames_4_N_Woolwich_to_Dartford.gpx">[4/20] Woolwich to Dartford (21.4km)</a>: The Thames Path deviates quite far from the River Thames as it’s interrupted by the Darent from the south.</li>
<li><a href="/gpx/The_Thames_5_N_Dartford_to_Gravesend.gpx">[5/20] Dartford to Gravesend (20.3km)</a>: This was by far the least pleasant section to run: the sewage treatment plants along the river stink, and the marshes aren’t much better. Gravesend definitely wins “worst place name” of anywhere I went.</li>

<p>For all the Essex routes I took c2c trains from West Ham and Fenchurch Street. I chose to cross to running on the north side of the river and run the Thames Estuary Path instead of the Thames Path as it was <em>far</em> better connected to London.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/gpx/The_Thames_6_N_Tilbury_to_Stanford_le_Hope.gpx">[6/20] Tilbury to Stanford-le-Hope (17km)</a>: I ran fairly far inland from the river (the land immediately next to the river was marshy). I wouldn’t recommend this path in winter.</li>
<li><a href="/gpx/The_Thames_7_N_Stanford_le_Hope_to_Benfleet.gpx">[7/20] Stanford-le-Hope to Benfleet (19.7km)</a>: This section was again quite muddy when I ran it in early spring 2023. Benfleet Station was my starting connection for the next 2 runs.</li>
<li><a href="/gpx/The_Thames_8_N_Canvey_Island_Loop.gpx">[8/20] Canvey Island (23.6km)</a>: I ran a lap of Canvey Island because I’m followed by a group of pedants on Strava who would’ve called me out if I skipped it.</li>
<li><a href="/gpx/The_Thames_9_N_Benfleet_to_Southend_on_Sea_completed_the_tidal_Thames_.gpx">[9/20] Benfleet to Southend-on-Sea (12km)</a>: I concluded I’d reached the end of the Thames when I reached a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Stone_(riparian)">London Stone</a> at Chalkwell, which marks the end of the Port of London’s Authority. However I continued to Southend-on-Sea because I figured if they’re claiming it’s at the seaside rather than the estuary-side that was good enough for me. Finished with fish and chips and ice cream on the beach.</li>

<li><a href="/gpx/The_Thames_10_N_Teddington_to_Chertsey.gpx">[10/20] Teddington to Chertsey (24.2km)</a>: For all the remaining runs I ran west. At Weybridge I had to cross the river via a ferry. Although it felt delightfully old-fashioned to cross the river by ringing a bell to call the ferryman, it was still 2023 so he took Apple Pay.</li>
<li><a href="/gpx/The_Thames_11_N_Chertsey_to_Windsor.gpx">[11/20] Chertsey to Windsor (22.4km)</a>: Ran past Runnymede, shortly before Windsor Castle, which was the site of the signing of the Magna Carta in 1215. I had no expectation of seeing this so it was a nice surprise! Windsor was packed with tourists.</li>

<li><a href="/gpx/The_Thames_12_N_Windsor_to_Bourne_End.gpx">[12/20] Windsor to Bourne End (19.5km)</a>: Worth noting that around this section the Great Western Main Line and the Elizabeth line run close to the Thames, so there’s a lot of optionality for shorter/longer runs.</li>
<li><a href="/gpx/The_Thames_13_N_Bourne_End_to_Henley_on_Thames.gpx">[13/20] Bourne End to Henley-on-Thames (20.7km)</a>: Lots of pleasant countryside but the path I plotted often took me up over hills and away from the Thames. The river at Henley was the straightest part I think I came across.</li>

<p>For some of the Oxfordshire runs I took GWR trains directly from Paddington, whereas for others I stayed overnight in Oxford (which is also connected to London via slower Cross Country services from Marylebone).</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/gpx/The_Thames_14_N_Henley_on_Thames_to_Pangbourne.gpx">[14/20] Henley-on-Thames to Pangbourne (30.9km)</a>: Around this time I grew a bit more confident with distance but I had the option to cut the run short at Reading. The area around Reading was the last busy part of the Thames Path.</li>
<li><a href="/gpx/The_Thames_15_N_Pangbourne_to_Wallingford_and_Chorley_.gpx">[15/20] Pangbourne to Wallingford (25.1km)</a>: I ran a lot of this on <a href="https://www.nationaltrail.co.uk/en_GB/trails/the-ridgeway/">The Ridgeway</a> rather than the Thames Path. I originally plotted this route with a plan to take a train back from Wallingford Station … only to discover it was a heritage station with <em>very</em> infrequent services so afterwards I looped back and took a train back to London from nearby Chorley.</li>

<li><a href="/gpx/The_Thames_16_N_Wallingford_to_Radley.gpx">[16/20] Wallingford to Radley (30.3km)</a>: I took a train to Didcot Parkway and a bus to Wallingford for the start of this one. The Thames Path crosses the river at Benson Lock but at the time the footbridge was closed; a ferry operated across the river instead. I suffered my worst hay fever reaction ever towards the end of this run so my pace dropped completely and I walked the last few kilometers back to Radley, where I then took a train to Oxford and another back to London.</li>

<ul>
<li><a href="/gpx/The_Thames_17_N_Radley_to_Appleton_via_Oxford_.gpx">[17/20] Radley to Appleton (31.4km)</a>: This section loops through Oxford, so aside from colleges’ dreaming spires you also see Port Meadow, The Trout Inn (which features prominently in Philip Pullman’s <em>The Book of Dust</em>), and the ruins of Godstow Abbey (which features prominently in <em>Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again</em>). I’d argue these are the last tourist attractions on the run: the remainder is all through countryside and very small towns. I had virtually no service for the second half of the run which made navigating back to Oxford a bit of a challenge; I eventually walked to the A420 and got a local bus back.</li>
<li><a href="/gpx/The_Thames_18_N_Bablock_Hythe_to_Lechlade.gpx">[18/20] Bablock Hythe to Lechlade (33.1km)</a>: The Thames Path switches to the opposite side of the river between Bablock Hythe and Appleton. I believe <a href="https://theferrymaninn.co.uk">the pub at Bablock Hythe</a> operates a ferry service, but at the time I was running it was closed. I therefore took a taxi from Oxford to start this run. St John’s Lock is the final (or first!) lock on the river, about a kilometer downstream from Lechlade. At Lechlade I took a local bus to Swindon and trains back from there.</li>

<li><a href="/gpx/The_Thames_19_N_Lechlade_to_Cricklade.gpx">[19/20] Lechlade to Cricklade (18.2km)</a>: Lechlade marks the end of the “navigable Thames” and aside from a few narrowboats anchored around Lechlade; I only saw one more rowing boat on the rest of the river. This was the quietest section: I only saw a handful of walkers and no other runners.</li>

The Thames Path hugged the river tightly but my route deviated slightly from it. The only challenge I had was when I encountered a herd of cows that took a little too much interest in me for my liking … the correct solution was <em>not</em> to climb through a barbed wire fence but instead to walk around them calmly, which I unfortunately learned the hard way.</p>
<p>By May the spring at Thames Head had dried up, but I instead found the spring that was the current source of the Thames tucked away in some woodland between the A433 and the A429. I wouldn’t recommend doing what I did, which was to wade through the Thames (it was only a few centimeters deep here!), cut myself on a whole bunch of brambles, and then get stung by a bunch of stinging nettles to find it. But on the other hand there was no chance I was going to run 400km and <em>not</em> find the start.</p>
<p>I continued on to Thames Head, the traditional start of the river and of the Thames Path. There I met a friendly group of walkers and runners, most of whom were about to set off down the path in the opposite direction. I considered getting a pint in at the Thames Head Inn nearby, but instead opted to avoid train delays and cancellations so I caught the train back to London from Kemble.</p></li>

<p>The final obvious question: “what’s next?” … A break?! The lesson from this project has been that I don’t mind travel for runs, just so long as the travel doesn’t take significantly more time than the run itself. That said, I’ve definitely got a couple more daft projects in the pipeline…</p>

It should be as easy to block someone as it is to follow them. It would make a statement to trolls and users alike. To users it would say that blocking is a common thing, don't think about it too much, and certainly don't be intimidated into not doing it. It must be almost as easy to undo. A command to review the list of recent blocks. Facebook comes closest to this. It is very easy to block an account but not quite this easy. I think they're probably heading there.
