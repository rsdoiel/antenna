date: 2024-01-07, from: RiscOS Story

The first Wakefield RISC OS Computer Club (WROCC) meeting of 2024 will take place on Wednesday, 10th January &#8211; a week later than the regular date, which would have been the 3rd &#8211; and the guest speakers will be Matthew and Hilary Philips from Sine Nomine. The subject of their talk will be RiscOSM, their mapping application that takes data converted from Open Street Map and makes it usable on RISC OS.

The penultimate day of 2023 saw another release of ScummVM, which includes a RISC OS version thanks to the efforts of Cameron Cawley.

## OF BOOKS AND BABIES

date: 2024-01-07, from: Howard Jacobson blog

The above might well be a sculpture of Zeus cradling his son Dionysus. Or it might be me cradling my new novel. Grandiose? You bet I&#8217;m grandiose. But it&#8217;s the grandiosity of fear - a parent&#8217;s dread that the new arrival (only four weeks away now) won&#8217;t fulfil its expectations, won&#8217;t live up to its billing, won&#8217;t be a prodigy, won&#8217;t change the world.
