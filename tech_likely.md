## The NYT runs on freedom and apparently they don't know that

date: 2024-05-10, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>This is a hard idea to get across, but there's nothing wrong with a news organization favoring things they depend on to exist.</p>
<p>For example, a news org that covers San Jose, CA is entitled to favor San Jose. It's okay for them to do things that help San Jose in competition with other cities. They could sponsor a food drive for the neediest in their community. It wouldn't be a conflict of interest, because it's understood that they have an interest in the success of San Jose. </p>
<p>A columnist that covers the NY Mets can be happy when the Mets win the World Series, and sad when they don't. This is not an integrity issue, or something they need to disclose, unless it's not obvious that they cover the Mets.</p>
<p>In that sense, every news org in the United States depends on the First Amendment, so it can be assumed they're in favor of democracy, because without it they couldn't exist. </p>
<p>This is why the editor of the NYT's statement about not favoring democracy is so ridiculous. He can't be objective about that, because the existence of his organization depends on the continuation of democracy in the US.</p>
<p>Whether he knows it or not, he's against Trump and in favor of the Democrats in the upcoming election.</p>
<p>Sometimes it's hard to see what's totally obvious. Ask a fish about water and they'll say there is no such thing. Same with free speech and the NYT. They are a product of free speech, without it, it makes no sense, doesn't work. But that's been true forever, so it feels like a given, but it isn't.</p>

## P&B: Riccardo Mori

<p>If you're enjoying the People and Blogs series and you want to see it grow, consider supporting on <a href="https://ko-fi.com/manuelmoreale">Ko-Fi</a>.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Let's start from the basics: can you introduce yourself?</h2>
<p>Hi everyone, I’m Riccardo Mori. When it’s time to introduce myself, I rarely deviate from what you can read in the <a href="https://morrick.me/en/about">About Me</a> page on my website, mostly because I did my best there to condense so much information in a few paragraphs. Anyway, I’m from Italy but I permanently relocated to Spain almost 20 years ago. I’m a writer — I write about technology, design, user interfaces and usability, but I also write fiction. While I wish writing were my one and only job, the daily bread is currently provided by my work as freelance translator and localisation specialist. </p>
<p>My educational background is rooted in the liberal arts. During my university years, I focused on philology, Italian and English literature, and art history. While I was in uni I also did some theatre, both as an actor and also as a dramatist, but that was a brief experience. Something that lasted a bit longer were reading performances, where I used to read some of my poetry in front of a live audience. There were also specific pieces I wrote for specific performances where I was accompanied by jazz musicians. I also did some book designing work and I even worked at an advertising agency for a relatively brief period of time.</p>
<p>How did I end up doing what I do today? Well, my fascination with computers started at a young age, in the early 1980s (yeah, this is sort of an age reveal, haha), and towards the end of that decade I was involved with DTP (Desktop Publishing) and the Macintosh as my primary platform. I had been wanting an Apple computer for a long time, but back then those machines were really out of my and my family’s budget. Having the opportunity to use them for work was a blast. My first workstation was a Macintosh SE with a laser printer and a handheld black-and-white scanner. But I had to wait until 1993 to finally be able to have a Mac all for myself. Up until then, it was essentially PC at home, and Mac at work. Which actually was kind of cool, because I was learning a lot of things about both platforms.</p>
<p>So, as my technical experience grew during the 1990s, I started doing some freelance work as ‘tech support guy’ and consultant. At the same time, I was equally busy on the literary side: between the late 1980s and early 1990s I wrote a lot of poetry and short stories, and in 1993 I started <em>Laboratorio Quillink</em> <em>(The Quillink Workshop)</em>, later renamed <em>Quillink Press,</em> a sort of small design &amp; print centre aimed at publishing and distributing my own and other people’s works, which soon became the official brand for all my self-published material.</p>
<p>Since I had been studying English since the age of 4, by this time I was quite proficient and fluent in it, so I did some literary translations as well. Then I was commissioned a few technical translations for computer magazines, and eventually I started freelancing as technical translator (this was late 2000-early 2001). I was a collaborator of Macworld Italia magazine for the better part of the 2000s. Another thing I’m proud of is that in the years 2001-2010, I translated into Italian Bruce Schneier’s <a href="http://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram.html"><em>Crypto-Gram</em></a>, free monthly newsletter providing summaries, analyses, insights, and commentary on security. By the way, I strongly recommend subscribing to it and following Schneier’s work if you care about cybersecurity and security in general (and in today’s world, you definitely should care about this stuff).</p>
<p>After relocating to Spain and learning Spanish, I extended my translation services to include Spanish as well. For the past 8 years or so, my translation work has for the most part shifted towards localisation, which means providing translations for software applications and interfaces; and this has its own set of challenges, as you don’t simply translate text from a language to another. You often have to work with UI constraints, and you have to translate following a specific context with its own rules, which may change from project to project.</p>
<p>I really hope this doesn’t come across as me bragging about all the things I’ve done… The truth is, there are people who, right from the start, have a clear idea of what they will do in their lives, and they work relentlessly towards that goal. I’m not one of those people. Sure, I knew I wanted to be a writer, and I worked hard to be a good writer, but I soon realised that writing was simply not enough to make a living. I’ve always been a curious person, obsessed with learning stuff and expanding my knowledge. All the things I’ve mentioned here — and, believe me, I left out a lot of other stuff — just reflect this kind of hunger, and also the need to find my path in life. </p>
<p>When you have so many interests, you end up having a lot of hobbies too, but since this is getting long already, I’ll just briefly mention photography, vintage technology and devices, typography, watches and horology in general, music and gaming. Of course I don’t have enough time to be a real nerd in any of these sectors (apart maybe from photography, which is something I cultivated since the 1980s, in film and digital format), so I’ll typically go through these in a sort of rotation, with periods where I’m more into typography, or watches, or old computers, etc. You get the idea.</p>
<h2>What's the story behind your blog?</h2>
<p>I started writing online in 1998, but at first my contributions were limited to mailing lists and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet_newsgroup">Usenet newsgroups</a>. In 2001 I opened an account on LiveJournal, and kept a sort of hybrid between blog and journal for many years there. In its early years, LiveJournal was a fantastic social network, deeper and more meaningful than anything that came after, like Facebook, Twitter or Tumblr. I have ‘met’ people there I still correspond with after all these years; people whom I consider good personal friends and not just Internet acquaintances.</p>
<p>The years between circa 2000 and 2007 saw a real boom for the blog as a form of personal expression, and I was fascinated. So much quality writing, so many interesting subjects, so many interesting people, especially in the tech sphere. But before WordPress came about, having a personal blog meant doing almost everything by hand. Registering a domain, paying for Web hosting, and knowing your HTML (and later CSS and JavaScript) to craft your own website. I didn’t have that expertise, and I didn’t know where to begin. When Apple launched iTools — the first iteration of what would become MobileMe and then iCloud — one of the service’s features was giving each user a small personal Web space (HomePage) to publish online. My first official tech blog was published there using a mediocre Mac application called BlogWave Studio. This was around late 2004-early 2005. It was mostly in Italian.</p>
<p>It was bare-bones, slow to load, clunky to publish. When WordPress arrived in 2006 (if I remember well), that changed everything. I opened an account on <a href="https://WordPress.com">WordPress.com</a> (the free blogging service) and published my ‘proper’ tech blog in Italian there from late 2005 to 2010. It was called <em>Autoritratto con mele</em> (“Self-portrait with apples”) to mean it was about tech from the perspective of an Apple user.</p>
<p>To reach a wider audience, and taking advantage of how easy publishing with WordPress was, I started a tech blog in English around 2007, called <em>The Quillink Observer</em>. Having two separate blogs seemed a good idea at the time. I could provide articles and insights for both my Italian audience, and the wider English-speaking audience at large. </p>
<p>But then I started <em>yet another blog</em> in 2008, to specifically talk about my passion for vintage Macs, vintage software and technology in general. It was aptly called <em><a href="http://systemfolder.wordpress.com/">System Folder</a></em>. It’s still accessible, but sadly these past years I’ve only had very little time to update it.</p>
<p>At this point, however, properly maintaining three main blogs was becoming a little too much work. So in 2011 I finally decided to merge <em>Autoritratto con mele</em> and <em>The Quillink Observer</em> into one website featuring articles in both English and Italian. I also decided it was time to own my identity, so I launched <strong><a href="http://morrick.me">morrick.me</a></strong> by registering and paying for the domain and for the Web hosting, and using WordPress as content management system because it was the one I was most familiar with, and still one of the most flexible.</p>
<p>When I was ready to launch my website/blog, I tried hard to find a name that could be catchy and also could really encapsulate my identity. But the few decent names I came up with just weren’t good enough, so my blog’s title is simply my name. </p>
<p>As for the writing style and my main source of inspiration: it was John Gruber and his <em>Daring Fireball</em> blog, initially. He has certainly inspired a lot of tech bloggers and writers over the years, and I have enjoyed his production for a long time. Lately, however, I feel he has lost a lot of his initial objectivity and what I call ‘critical grip’ by being a bit too close to Apple.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, my main blog is 13 years old, and it has gone through three major visual redesigns. Every time I changed its look, it was mostly due to strictly technical reasons: the blog’s WordPress theme was no longer supported, the theme creator couldn’t keep up with WordPress’ updates, and things started to break. At first I tried salvaging the whole theme structure by heavily editing chunks of CSS myself, but it was too cumbersome, and ultimately too fragile. Switching to a better-maintained WordPress theme was more efficient. The one I’m currently using is a paid theme by a small company called <a href="https://www.elmastudio.de/en/">ElmaStudio</a>, it’s still maintained, and it’s simple enough to not interfere too much with the platform updates WordPress routinely puts out.</p>
<p>You can see how my blog looked in 2011, and read about other trivia (like the evolution of my identity logo) in an article I published in 2021, <a href="https://morrick.me/archives/9398"><em>10 years of morrick.me</em></a>.</p>
<h2>What does your creative process look like when it comes to blogging?</h2>
<p>I remember one tech blogger writing, many years ago, that the secret of a successful blog was to ‘show up every day, no matter what’. I appreciate those who do, those who indeed publish daily or almost daily on their blogs. But it’s just not my style. It’s not bad advice, but to me it feels like business advice. And for me, having a blog isn’t a business endeavour. I have a blog because I want to share knowledge and perspectives. It’s because I want to communicate whenever I feel I have something to say. Consequently, I only publish when I have something to say. As I wrote <a href="https://morrick.me/archives/9727">in a past article</a>, for something to appear on my blog, three main conditions have to be fulfilled:</p>
<ol>
<li>I have something to talk about, something to say.</li>
<li>I feel I have something useful to add to the conversation.</li>
<li>I have time and will to commit to writing and publishing a piece.</li>
</ol>
<p>I typically apply these rules/conditions strictly, that’s why I generally update my blog 1-3 times per month, sometimes less.</p>
<p>Ideas for articles may come from what’s currently being debated in tech; some important product or innovation that’s been introduced; some product I discovered and I’m satisfied with, which I feel I should review to let more people know about it; some particular user interface that’s worth talking about or criticising (be it the UI of an app, of an operating system, of an appliance, etc.); more general themes regarding technology and its impact on our lives; things like these. And I tend to do my homework before speaking. I don’t like to just talk about something because I feel I have to have an opinion on everything — like a lot of people do today, sadly.</p>
<p>As for the writing and the tools, my workflow is rather simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>The draft happens in <a href="https://ia.net/writer">iA Writer</a>, where I write in Markdown. I don’t usually write a first draft, then a second, then a third and so forth. There is just one draft. I usually start writing and adjusting my sentences as I write. Then I reach a point where I feel I should leave the draft and go back to it later. Then there’s more writing and adjusting as I write. Then I re-read the whole piece, proofread, perform minor adjustments, have the Text-to-Speech voice in Mac OS read the piece aloud, make more small adjustments so that the article has a good flow, read the article again another couple of times, and when it’s in its final state…</li>
<li>The article is then exported to HTML. I open it with <a href="https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/">BBEdit</a> and remove all the superfluous markup.</li>
<li>The final step is copying the article’s text with the necessary HTML entities and pasting it into <a href="https://redsweater.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit</a>. From there, I add categories, tags, an excerpt, and publish the piece.   </li>
</ul>
<h2>Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe the physical space influences your creativity?</h2>
<p>Not really. Whenever I’m writing an article I want to publish on my blog, I typically have a clear idea of what I want to talk about and how I want to talk about it. I’ve written pretty much everywhere — though I will admit I prefer to have a quiet environment around me. I write best at home, at dead of night.</p>
<p>Also, the tools I favour for writing are pen and paper, and traditional computers — sometimes even vintage computers, like one of my old ThinkPads, or my 2008 black MacBook running Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard. These are less distracting environments than iPads and iPhones for me.</p>
<h2>A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your tech stack?</h2>
<p>Both the process of registering the website and providing Web hosting were handled by a dear friend of mine on my behalf. So I don’t exactly know where the domain is registered. Web hosting is provided by <a href="https://bluehost.com">bluehost.com</a>, which I would say it’s a pretty reliable service. I only experienced a couple of hiccups in thirteen years. And as mentioned above, I use WordPress as CMS.</p>
<h2>Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would you do anything differently?</h2>
<p>No, not really. Maybe the only thing I would do differently would be to avoid free solutions and avoid publishing on Web spaces I don’t own. I would start immediately with having a personal website, hosting, etc. Which is the exact piece of advice I would give to anyone who wants to start seriously blogging today. Use free solutions if you just want to publish something online occasionally and don’t care much about owning your identity. I still think WordPress is the best option because the company has reached a ‘too big to fail’ level by now.</p>
<h2>Financial question since the web is obsessed with money: how much does it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost or does it generate some revenue? And what's your position on people monetising personal blogs?</h2>
<p>I currently have to pay for two registered domains, and the Web hosting (which is shared between the two). The whole operation costs me about €100-120 annually. My blog doesn’t generate revenue, apart from the occasional donation, and what little I make by selling my two books of short stories (advertised in the footer of my website). Since I have a job, I don’t need to monetise my blog. Some people told me I should do it anyway, because ‘you never know’, but I currently see no way to monetise it apart from resorting to a&#41; advertising, and b&#41; putting some content behind a paywall. And I hate both options. </p>
<p>I hate what advertising has become online. I hate that today if you want a great browsing experience, you need to install all kinds of ad-blockers. And I don’t want to subject my readers to all that crap. You can visit my website with all blockers and trackers disabled, there’s pretty much nothing going on in the background apart from some basic WordPress analytics.</p>
<p>And since my blog is not a news outlet and I don’t have to pay anyone, putting what I write behind a paywall makes no sense to me. I don’t want to divide my audience into a privileged tier and a free-for-all tier. Nor do I want to create special content for ‘patrons’ that is invisible to everyone else. </p>
<p>Time ago I tried a new spin on a consolidated formula, and I called that the <em>Small Fish sponsorship</em>. As I mention on the <a href="https://morrick.me/sponsorship">relevant page</a> of my website: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>…The spirit behind this is simple: I’m (still) a small fish compared to other prominent tech-oriented blogs and websites, and I can’t offer their kind of traffic or visibility. Thus what I ask in return is relatively modest compared to those blogs. <em>[€450 for a week-long slot]</em> Still, if a sponsor has a particularly compelling product to offer, what I can provide is potentially more than just a mention and a thank you. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It hasn’t had much of a success, so far, but I’m not complaining. I thought it was an option worth offering. For now, I’m happy with the way things are: I provide free content, and if you really appreciate something I wrote, or you found it particularly useful or illuminating, you can send a donation or purchase my books — they’re only $1.99 each.</p>
<p>Do I like people monetising their blogs and content? I guess it depends on how they do it, what they offer, the quality of such content, and so forth. As a reader, I tend to favour those creators who find a way to monetise their content that doesn’t influence the content itself. I mean, finding sponsors is great, but when your production is constantly sponsored, I start wondering about your objectivity. I generally appreciate those creators who manage to monetise what they do, what they write, by clearly separating the content from the money. An easy example: those who offer cool merchandise as a way to support them. Perhaps it’s not the greatest way to make money, but if you write tech reviews and you have a little e-store with t-shirts, mugs, desk accessories, etc., it’s very likely that I won’t question your integrity when I read the stuff you publish.</p>
<p>Another way to monetise content that’s quite popular today is to use Patreon. It’s not a bad idea, but again, it depends on how the creator embeds it in their production. Some people use it in its simplest form: <em>Support me on Patreon. There are no particular perks, just different tiers for support, from the bare minimum to fan-level support.</em> Others do the same, but also offer some perks if you pick higher tiers of patronage. I’m fine with these options. What I don’t like is using Patreon as a way to basically paywall your content. Like those ‘free’ apps you download from the App Store, which are barely functional in their free default state, and start being useful when you either make an in-app purchase or, worse, activate a subscription.</p>
<p>If 90% of what you offer is a ‘secret’ unless people become patrons, I can’t even evaluate how good (or bad) your stuff is without at least paying you once (by becoming a patron for one month, then cancelling in case I don’t like what I see).</p>
<p>There isn’t anyone in particular I’m supporting in the blog community on a regular basis. But I have shown support for different people in different ways at different times. By purchasing something via an affiliate link. By purchasing an app if the blogger in question is also a developer. By sending donations in difficult moments when the blogger specifically asked for it. By purchasing some merchandise. You get the idea.</p>
<h2>Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth checking out? And also, who do you think I should be interviewing next?</h2>
<p>Over the years, I’ve become increasingly selective with whom I read. There are a few prominent names in this short list, and chances are you already know them or they’ve already been mentioned by people you’ve previously interviewed. Anyway, here goes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nick Heer’s <a href="https://pxlnv.com">Pixel Envy</a> is a great read. I’ve been following Nick for a long time now. While at first his blog and style resembled John Gruber’s a bit too closely, over time he has found his voice, and the overall quality of his blog has kept increasing. Very good tech commentary.</li>
<li><a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/">Michael Tsai’s blog</a> is another must-read. He has perfected the art of presenting tech news and assembling several different quotes from other writers as a way to offer you all these perspectives and points of view on any given subject. Sometimes he’ll chime in, too, but not always. This way you have a general idea of how the debate is shaping up, and you can make up your own mind without being influenced or pushed towards a particular point of view.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other blogs I enjoy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mike Rockwell’s <a href="https://initialcharge.net">Initial Charge</a>. No bells and whistles, just straight honest thoughts.</li>
<li><a href="https://schwarztech.net">SchwarzTech</a> by Eric Schwarz, another tech veteran.</li>
<li>Howard Oakley’s <a href="https://eclecticlight.co">The Eclectic Light Company</a>. I’ve been reading Mr Oakley since the days of computer magazines; he used to write articles for MacUser UK, Personal Computer World, Mac Format. His blog has two main subjects: art, and the Mac platform. His articles usually tackle technical (sometimes very technical) aspects of Mac OS and are quite informative.</li>
<li>Jesper’s <a href="https://take.surf">Take</a> blog. He is such a private person, and his blog has no personal info about him, so I only know him as Jesper. But his blog is always a refreshing read. I’ve been reading him for years and I can’t remember a time when I disagreed with anything he said.</li>
<li><a href="https://reverttosaved.com">Revert to Saved</a>, by <a href="https://craiggrannell.com">Craig Grannell</a>. A prolific tech writer who contributes to sites such as Wired, TechRadar, Stuff, Wireframe. Another enjoyable read.</li>
<li><a href="https://inessential.com">Inessential</a> by Brent Simmons. Brent is the developer of NetNewsWire, the best RSS feed reader for Mac. He doesn’t post often on his blog, but I always like when he does.</li>
<li><a href="https://joecieplinski.com/blog/">Joe Cieplinski’s blog</a>. Joe is a developer and a musician, and a great guy. He used to write more on his blog and I always loved to read his insights and points of view on Apple and tech in general. I still think his blog is worth bookmarking despite the scarce updates.</li>
<li>The only blog in Italian I’m currently reading on a fairly regular basis is <a href="https://macintelligence.org">QuickLoox</a> by my friend Lucio Bragagnolo. And I don’t just read him because he’s a friend, but because he’s a very smart person and I enjoy reading his insights. </li>
</ul>
<p>Picking a person from this list for your next interview is hard, as I’m tempted to just tell you to try contacting them all. I’d give precedence to Nick Heer, Michael Tsai and Lucio Bragagnolo if you haven’t interviewed them already. They’re all busy people, but they’re also approachable and amiable, so perhaps they’ll play along.</p>
<h2>Final question: is there anything you want to share with us?</h2>
<p>I’ll start with a little shameless self-promotion: I’ve written two books of short stories, which I call ‘Minigrooves’. They’re available on Apple’s Books Store and on the Amazon Kindle Store.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://morrick.me/minigrooves-short-stories">Basic info and purchase links</a></li>
<li><a href="https://morrick.me/archives/6304">More details</a></li>
<li><a href="http://minigroov.es/">Official website</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I’m currently working on a science-fiction novel called <em>Low Fidelity</em>, a project I started so many years ago. I’ve been working on it for a long time, not because it’s a particularly monumental work (although it’ll be comprised of more than one book), but because I’ve alternated periods of intense inspiration and periods of low tide where life and my main job took extreme precedence over it. You can read a bit more about <em>Low Fidelity</em> <a href="https://crosslines.wordpress.com/about-low-fidelity/">on this page</a> at the <em>Crosslines/Low Fidelity</em> website. (That website is a bit old and may contain outdated information, so navigate the rest of it at your risk, haha).</p>
<p>With all this out of the way, here’s a brief list of books I recommend. I won’t add any commentary, because otherwise this interview would never end. It’s enough to say that these are all good food for the mind.</p>
<p>Fiction:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’d recommend anything by Neal Stephenson, but I have a soft spot for his early works, like <em>Snow Crash</em>, <em>The Diamond Age</em>, and <em>Cryptonomicon</em>.</li>
<li>Truman Capote, <em>The Complete Stories</em>. Penguin Books have recently published this collection of short stories, and I loved it. Usually Capote gets recommended for his most famous works, like <em>In Cold Blood</em>, <em>Breakfast at Tiffany’s</em>, or maybe <em>Other Voices, Other Rooms</em>. But with these short stories you really feel how good of a storyteller he was. </li>
</ul>
<p>Non-fiction:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nassim Nicholas Taleb, <em>The Black Swan</em></li>
<li>Jaron Lanier, <em>You Are Not A Gadget: A Manifesto</em></li>
<li>George Orwell, <em>Essays</em></li>
<li>Neal Stephenson, <em>In the Beginning... Was the Command Line</em></li>
<li>Rick Edwards &amp; Dr Michael Brooks, <em>Hollywood Wants to Kill You – The Peculiar Science of Death in the Movies</em> (Despite the grim title, this is a really entertaining, smart, and nerdy book).</li>
</ul>
<p>While I may listen to specific podcast episodes if they come strongly recommended, I’m currently not subscribed to any podcast. To be honest, I don’t particularly like the medium, but it’s mostly a ‘me’ problem. There are people who are capable of listening to podcasts while doing something else. I can do that with music, but with the spoken word, it gets complicated, especially for someone like me who has to <em>read</em> and <em>write</em> a lot for work. </p>
<p>To properly enjoy a podcast, I would have to just sit and listen to it. And many podcasts — particularly tech-oriented ones — are made of episodes lasting well over one hour and a half each. I just don’t have the time. I also think that it’s a bit disrespectful to commandeer the audience’s time by producing extremely long podcast episodes.</p>
<p>I shall end my response and this interview with a short list of games that I’ve found to be unique in one way or another. Everyone’s taste in games is different, so I’ll just offer their titles and people can check them out on their preferred platform (Steam, Epic Games, etc.). Not all of these are available for the Mac, unfortunately:</p>
<ul>
<li>Half-Life 2 (an oldie but an evergreen title)</li>
<li>The BioShock franchise</li>
<li>The Dishonored franchise</li>
<li>The Long Dark</li>
<li>INFRA↘︎</li>
<li>Disco Elysium</li>
<li>SIGNALIS</li>
<li>Kentucky Route Zero</li>
<li>Pacific Drive</li>
<li>All the Rusty Lake puzzle games</li>
<li>Alien: Isolation</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you, Manuel, for contacting me and giving me the opportunity to talk about myself and share all this information. All the best, and let’s keep in touch!</p>

## Haiku isn’t a BeOS successor anymore

date: 2024-05-10, from: OS News

So I got accepted into GSoC again! I’m going to be working on WebKit2. But what is WebKit2, or even WebKit, for that matter? Well, WebPositive uses WebKit to render its web pages. Currently, we use the WebKitLegacy API to communicate with WebKit. It would be nice to switch to the newer version: WebKit2. However, our port of WebKit2 still needs work. At present, it has lost its ability to even render any webpage at all! So, getting WebKit2 to work will be the primary goal of my GSoC project. If there’s time left, I might be able to integrate it into WebPositive. The advantages WebKit2 has for WebPositive will be mostly invisible to end-users. The code will hopefully be more maintainable than the deprecated WebKitLegacy and we’ll get access to several newer APIs such as the ad-blocking API. Perhaps the most visible change: problems in one part of the code should be less likely to crash the whole browser. ↫ Zardshard on the Haiku website The current state of WebPositive, the only native Haiku web browser, is emblematic of why I have personally lost all interest in the successor to what is still my favourite operating system of all time. Haiku OS supports several browsers, and if you read any forum post about which browser to use, or watch any of the enthusiastic Haiku videos by the insanely awesome Action Retro, they&#8217;ll all advise you to use any of the non-native Qt or GTK browsers instead &#8211; because WebPositive just can&#8217;t compete with the ported, non-native browsers. Since everybody using Haiku is opting to use the better ported browsers, WebPositive has fallen even more by the wayside; now it has to play catch-up, and by the time WebKit2 has been properly ported and bug-tested, and has been integrated into WebPositive, which then has to be bug-tested as well, we&#8217;re going to be months, if not years, down the line. In the meantime, the ported browsers will have been regularly updated with newer, better versions. Unless the focus for the single most important application of any general purpose desktop operating system is placed solely on WebPositive, it simply won&#8217;t be able to keep up with the ported browsers. Why even work on WebPositive at all at that point? It&#8217;s not like anyone is using it, so why bother? And this highlights a problem for people like me, who prefer to have native Haiku applications instead of ports of software I can already run elsewhere. As a former BeOS user, I am not interested in a vessel for running Qt applications that I can, in all likelihood, run better on Linux. Why would I go through the trouble of assembling a machine with hardware Haiku supports, only to then run the same applications I&#8217;m already running on Fedora or OpenBSD, but worse? If you browse through Haiku Depot today, it feels like the vast majority of modern, maintained, and working software are ports of Qt (and GTK) software we already know and love from other, more mature, more stable, more usable, and more feature-rich platforms. Haiku has chosen to pour a lot of energy and manpower into becoming an operating system designed to run ported, often Qt, applications, but the downside to that is that new and maintained native Haiku applications, that play to the strengths of the platform, are few and far between. A Haiku developer once told me that real people use Haiku every day, and they need real applications, and ported applications make it possible for not only Haiku developers themselves, but also normal users, to run and use Haiku every day. This is a valid argument that I fully understand and agree with &#8211; it just means Haiku isn&#8217;t for me. And while that&#8217;s sad for me, it&#8217;s entirely fine. Haiku&#8217;s developers have chosen to focus on building a daily-drivable operating system with tons of ported applications, instead of an ideologically pure operating system you can&#8217;t really use because it only has like 4 native applications and nothing else. And that&#8217;s a valid, smart, and practical choice that I fully respect and understand, even if it means Haiku isn&#8217;t really a BeOS successor anymore.

## 2024-05-09 Hoping for the next AI winter

date: 2024-05-09, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-05-09-hoping-for-the-next-ai-winter">2024-05-09 Hoping for the next AI winter</h1>

<p><a class="account" href="https://chirp.enworld.org/@taichara" title="@taichara@chirp.enworld.org">@taichara</a> pointed me to a blog post that Creative Commons (CC) wrote in 2023 about the court cases against GitHub, Stable Diffusion, Midjourney and the claim that their use of copyrighted works to train the machines is copyright infringement. CC does not agree.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As Creative Commons has argued elsewhere, and others agree, I believe that this type of use should be protected by copyright’s fair use doctrine. In this blog post I will discuss what fair use is, what purpose it serves, and why I believe that using copyrighted works to train generative AI models should be permitted under this law. – <a href="https://creativecommons.org/2023/02/17/fair-use-training-generative-ai/">Fair Use: Training Generative AI</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I guess I don&rsquo;t mind that blog post. For one, Fair Use is a very USA thing and I don&rsquo;t live there. Furthermore, the CC licenses don&rsquo;t say &ldquo;this material is fine for AI training&rdquo; – so whether this is fine or not will be decided by the courts. I would only worry if CC turns out to be working on a version 5 of their licenses with an explicit exception for AI training. And even then, we can keep on using version 4 of the license. There is no automatic upgrade option.</p>

<p>This is why I feel fine.</p>

<p>Imagine the Dude from The Big Lebowski saying, &ldquo;Yeah, well, that&rsquo;s just, like, their opinion…&rdquo;</p>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t look as if CC will be changing the license. The courts still get to decide. If the courts decide in favour of free-for-all AI training, then rich people win for the moment. But even then, we can still nationalise their businesses, or prohibit AI training, or raise prices on electricity and water. The fight isn&rsquo;t over. Not by a long shot.</p>

<p>Maybe this is a thing with lawyers. We trust people who share our values and we’d trust somebody when they write something along the lines of “AI training is terrible and AI use is dubious but what can you do, it’s in the hand of the courts, we certainly don’t support it.” But lawyers trust other lawyers who say “we’ll see what the courts say but our understanding is that nobody should stop AI training because that’s the trade-off copyright makes and we support people and corporations exercising their rights.”</p>

<p>The apparent moral support on copyright grounds is revolting, but this approach seems typical to me. They say: The point of the law is this or that. We say: The result of these actions is bad for society and bad for the climate. They are externalising all the costs. The artists and authors who want to produce new works are losing their jobs. The people double-checking the computers and their training are burning out. The communities where these corporations build their computing centres suffer from water scarcity because the water is used to cool the computers. The countries where these corporations build their computing centres need to build more power plants because so much electricity is required to train their models. The move to renewable energies is delayed. Phasing out nuclear power is delayed and more radioactive waste ends up on our lands.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sending this message was important to us. We considered ourselves to be a powerful culture.
This place is not a place of honor&hellip; no highly esteemed deed is commemorated here&hellip; nothing valued is here.
– <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_nuclear_waste_warning_messages">Long-term nuclear waste warning messages</a>, Wikipedia</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or we can believe in nuclear fusion:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>AI models made up of billions of parameters require huge amounts of energy to train. OpenAI&rsquo;s old GPT-3 system reportedly consumed 936 megawatt hours … the average household consumes about 10.5 MWh per year. That means training GPT-3 consumed as much energy as about 90 households consume in a year. – <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/22/google_deepmind_train_alphageometry_system/">Energy breakthrough needed to build AGI, says OpenAI boss Altman</a>, The Register</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sadly, nuclear fusion only seems to be working inside the sun:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1955: At the first Atoms for Peace meeting in Geneva, Homi J. Bhabha predicts that fusion will be in commercial use within two decades. – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_nuclear_fusion">Timeline of nuclear fusion</a>, Wikipedia</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And what for? The people who are looking for answers get served bullshit slop that&rsquo;s wrong and hurtful and racist and misogynist. We see this in customer service degrading, in search engines degrading, in websites degrading. The corporations don&rsquo;t mind that they&rsquo;re feeding us slop as long as they are making money.</p>

<p>We are enabling this because these corporations are powerful and rich. They buy our politicians with money and promises of jobs, they don&rsquo;t pay the taxes they ought to pay and then they don&rsquo;t deliver on the jobs, and the jobs they offer are menial and subservient when we&rsquo;d prefer to be creative and free. We thought we&rsquo;d be writing and painting all day while the machines serve us but we end up serving them while they do the writing and painting, badly!</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard to defend against these corporations because the knowledge required to defeat them is not known to us all. We don&rsquo;t read about it in the media. Instead, they volunteer for all the posts, offer their experts, pay for their own research, write their own glowing press releases and commission promising reports. This is how regulatory capture works.</p>

<p>So yes, we should nationalise them, regulate them, force them to pay for the true cost of resources they use, outlaw their energy waste, force them to label their output, shun them. We should kick them from our company. Like a creeping disease their rot spreads, destroying the technology we built, the search engines, databases, websites, turning it all into AI slop. It is revolting.</p>

<p>And maybe copyright is not the right tool to stop corporations from training their machines on our works. But in the big picture, they are still wrong.</p>

<p><a class="account" href="https://social.coop/@eloquence" title="@eloquence@social.coop">@eloquence</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The folks who are calling such training &ldquo;theft&rdquo; might regret what they seem to be implicitly asking for, i.e. much stricter copyright. Copyright law won&rsquo;t prevent Microsoft, Google, OpenAI or Adobe from making shady licensing deals, but they&rsquo;ll prevent the free/open community from keeping up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s true, I don&rsquo;t want to ask for stricter copyright. But I still oppose all the things that are wrong with the current AI bubble.</p>

<p><a class="account" href="https://mastodon.social/@mcc" title="@mcc@mastodon.social">@mcc</a> recently wrote about a similar thing: We use free software licenses in order to distribute our software for the benefit of our fellow humans but not necessarily to train the machines of corporations that are responsible for all the slop.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Like, heck, how am I <em>supposed</em> to rely on my code getting preserved after I lose interest, I die, BitBucket deletes every bit of Mercurial-hosted content it ever hosted, etc? Am I supposed to rely on <em>Microsoft</em> to responsibly preserve my work? Holy crud no.
We <em>want</em> people to want their code widely mirrored and distributed. That was the reason for the licenses. That was the social contract. But if machine learning means the social contract is dead, why would people want their code mirrored? – <a href="https://mastodon.social/@mcc/112209218607258564">mmc</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We&rsquo;re using copyright to keep the software free. If AI regurgitating our software from its impenetrable memories circumvents copyright it also circumvents our licenses and therefore pulls the claws and teeth free software has to fight for its freedom.</p>

<p>This is why opposing the current AI bubble is important. No matter how I look at it, the big picture shows that this kind of AI is our enemy.</p>

<p>This is why we continue fighting all the negatives these corporations bring to the table. And if it turns out that their business model doesn&rsquo;t work unless they bring all these negatives to the table, then I guess that&rsquo;s just that. We are under no obligation to support their business model. In fact, it is our right and our duty to regulate the world in order to improve it for all of us. We&rsquo;ve been doing it for a very long time.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s to hoping for the next AI winter.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the history of artificial intelligence, an AI winter is a period of reduced funding and interest in artificial intelligence research. The field has experienced several hype cycles, followed by disappointment and criticism, followed by funding cuts, followed by renewed interest years or even decades later. – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter">AI winter</a>, Wikipedia</p>

## The webs

date: 2024-05-09, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>We’re all familiar with the idea of the web, the www, the global network we pretty much all use daily. When we say “the web” we mean the whole thing, from the biggest of social platforms to the smallest of personal blogs. The web is cluttered, minimalistic, loud, and also quiet. It’s a cacophony, a hotchpotch of styles, ideas, and cultures. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1BneeJTDcU">Bo described it well</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A little bit of everything<br />
All of the time</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And in this eclectic mix, different people have tried to carve out niches, in an attempt to separate some of that content from the rest: <a href="https://neustadt.fr/essays/the-small-web/">the small web</a>, <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/cozy-web">the cozy web</a>, <a href="https://foreverliketh.is/blog/the-personal-web/">the personal web</a>, <a href="https://www.jackcheng.com/the-slow-web/">the slow web</a>, <a href="https://briankoberlein.com/tech/quiet-web/">the quiet web</a>. I find it interesting that all these have one thing in common and that is the very humane scale of the vision. The bigger the web becomes, and the more power we’re given, the more some people feel the need to get back to a more intimate space, a space where things move slower, where connections and interactions are given time to develop.</p>
<p>Or maybe I’m just projecting. Maybe it’s because that’s what I’m trying to find here in this weird digital space I created for myself.</p>                <hr>

<p>Apple unveiled their new line of iPads yesterday in a pre-recorded video titled “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1J38FlDKxo&amp;t=1564s">Let Loose</a>.” As with the previous “Scary Fast” MacBook Pro launch video, “Let Loose” ends with a tag proclaiming “Shot on iPhone” — this time adding “Edited on Mac and iPad,” and the fine print: “All presenters, locations, and aerial footage shot on iPhone.”</p>
<p>During the live stream I actively wondered if the iPhone acquisition of “Scary Fast” had been a one-time thing. “Let Loose” looks great, as all Apple videos do, but some shots featured a shallower depth-of-field than is possible with an iPhone-sized lens and sensor combo. At the end of the event, I wondered publicly <a href="https://www.threads.net/@prolost/post/C6rbqRYvP58">on Threads</a> about this. Replies speculated about additional lens rigs, some improved version of <a href="https://twitter.com/i/events/1449156150507626498">Cinematic Mode</a>, or maybe blurring the background in post.</p>
<h2>Panavision Lens Relay System</h2>
<p>After Apple released a behind-the-scenes video about the production of “Scary Fast,” the Internet <a href="https://prolost.com/blog/scarybts">did its internet thing</a> and questioned the “Shot on iPhone” claim, as if “Shot on iPhone” inherently means “shot with zero other gear besides an iPhone.” These takes were dumb and bad and some even included assertions that Apple added additional lensing to the phones, which they did not.</p>
<p>But for “Let Loose,” they did.</p>
<p>“Let Loose” was shot on iPhone 15 Pro Max, and Apple says that for several shots where a shallow depth-of-field was desired, Panavision lenses were attached to the iPhones using a Panavision-developed mount called the “Lens Relay System.” This rig is publicly available for rent from Panavision today, although not currently listed on their website.</p>

<p>What’s a “lens relay system?” Think of a telescope. Instead of focusing an image on a plane of film or a sensor, it creates what’s known as an “aerial image” that you capture with another lens system — your eye. If you’ve ever smashed your phone up to a pair of binoculars successfully, you’ve made a lens relay system.</p>
<p>I used a Frasier lens relay system from Panavision to get small lenses into tight spaces for a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfgBl_aMI_0">Ruby Tuesday commercial</a> I directed. The Frasier is a pericope lens, one physical unit that contains both the taking lens and the capture lens.</p>
<p>I don't know for sure that Panavision's system uses an aerial image rather than a ground glass like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k9AVhcIsLA&amp;t=705s">this rig</a> from Beastgrip, but the image quality and name make me think it does.</p>
<p>Either way, with Panavision’s system, the iPhone’s own lens rephotographs the image created by any Panavision lens you like. The iPhone provides the image capture, in ProRes Apple Log, of course.</p>

<p>There are, of course, many systems for mounting lenses to iPhone (Beastgrip is <a href="https://beastgrip.com/pages/beastgrip-dof-adapter-mk3">working on a new one</a>), but it’s certainly notable that Panavision made one, as they exclusively serve a market of high-end professional filmmakers.</p>
<h2>Why Lenses?</h2>
<p>If “Scary Fast” could be shot without add-on lenses, what does Panavision’s rig bring to the table? Apple Log allows the iPhone to capture highly-malleable, 10-bit ProRes footage that fits into a professional pipeline alongside footage from high-end cinema cameras, but the one thing it can’t do is capture the shallow depth-of-field that we associate with high-end productions. The look of “Let Loose” is a collaboration between the iPhone’s clean capture, the focus control of the Panavision lenses, and top-tier color grading — masterfully overseen by an uncredited cinematographer.</p>
<h2>Don’t You Start Internet</h2>
<p>So is it fair to say “Let Loose” was “Shot on iPhone” if it was done with the help of gear the average iPhone owner could never afford? Of course it is. Feel free to re-read this: <a href="https://prolost.com/blog/scarybts">What Does and Doesn't Matter about Apple Shooting their October Event on iPhone 15 Pro Max</a> — but in short, the fact that Apple can drop an iPhone into an otherwise-unaltered professional film production and match the look of their previous videos without anyone even noticing is meaningful.</p>
<p>In fact, “Let Loose” is the first Apple Event finished and streamed in HDR, pushing the iPhone’s capture abilities even further than “Scary Fast.”</p>
<p>You don’t <em>need</em> to add cinema lenses to the iPhone to <a href="https://prolost.com/blog/iphonelog-peru-taiwan">make great-looking images</a>, but the fact that you can is cool.</p>
<p>You also don’t need to twist yourself into knots wondering why you might choose an iPhone over a professional cinema camera when you have a Panavision lens budget. Personally, I’m more excited about the <a href="https://prolost.com/blog/iphonelog-peru-taiwan">run-and-gun possibilities</a>, but a vote of confidence from the most elite cinema rental house only bolsters the story of iPhone as professional video camera.</p>
<p>Or just make note that Apple confidently intercut footage shot with the most respected cinema lenses available with shots lensed with unadorned iPhones.</p>

<h2>The Real Story Here is Apple Log</h2><p>None of this would be possible without Apple having adding Log ProRes recording to the iPhone 15 Pro.

## COSMIC improves its application store, display mirroring, and more

date: 2024-05-09, from: OS News

As its first alpha release is closing in, we have another monthly update about COSMIC, System76&#8217;s new Linux desktop environment written in Rust. This month, they&#8217;ve further polished and shored up their application store, imaginatively named COSMIC App Store, and it&#8217;s supposedly incredibly fast &#8211; something I can&#8217;t say for its GNOME and KDE counterparts, which tend to be so slow I&#8217;ve always just defaulted to updating through the command line, mostly. The file manager now has support for GVfs (GNOME Virtual file system) for making external storage like USB drives work properly, and Greeter login screen, Edit text editor, drag and drop, and copy/paste have been improved in various ways as well. Theming has seen a lot of work this month, with support for icon themes added to the App Library, fixed applet sizes, and more tweaks, while light themes have been disabled for now to fix a number of issues with colour selection being too dark. There&#8217;s also display mirroring now, which even works when the individual displays have different resolutions, orientations, and refresh rates. Pop!_OS is now also being built for ARM64, which makes sense because System76 is now also selling ARM servers. There&#8217;s also a bunch of work being done by the community as the alpha release nears.

## Opening windows in Linux with sockets, bare hands and 200 lines of C

date: 2024-05-09, from: OS News

X Server is slowly being deprecated in the Linux world and being replaced Wayland. Still X11 is an interesting protocol to look at from the perspective of binary communication and management of resource which require fast speeds. In this post I tried to cover basic information and create a simple but working app that is simple, defined in single file and easily compiles. No external code except libc was used. I find it fascinating when you can open black boxes and see how gears move each other. ↫ Hereket As much as the time of X has come and is now finally in the process of going, it&#8217;s still an incredibly powerful set of tools that even in a bare state can do way, way more than you think. X has come with its own window manager &#8211; twm &#8211; for decades, and it includes several basic applications like xedit, xclock, xterm, xeyes. Twm is actually pretty cool, and includes some features, like iconify to desktop, that I wish still existed in modern desktop environments. It&#8217;s quite bare-bones, though, and I doubt there&#8217;s anyone out there unironically using it today. As the linked article notes, even without advanced, complex libraries, toolkits, desktop environments, and so on, it&#8217;s entirely possible to create fully functional windows and applications with X. Of course, this makes perfect sense and shouldn&#8217;t be surprising &#8211; it&#8217;s the X Window System, after all &#8211; but you so rarely hear or read about it that you&#8217;d almost forget and just assume something like GNOME or KDE is an absolute requirement to use X.

## ChromeOS App Mall unifies app discovery for Chromebooks

date: 2024-05-09, from: OS News

We’ve been on the lookout for the arrival of the ChromeOS App Mall for a few months now. First discovered back in March, the new App Mall is arriving to do one, simple task: put the apps users want in one place to be found a Chromebook. While we have access to web apps, PWAs, Android apps and Linux apps on Chromebooks, it’s not always clear how to go about finding them. Should you install the web version or the Play Store version? Which Play Store apps install a PWA versus an Android app? Where should you go to find the right one for you? ↫ Robby Payne at Chrome Unboxed ChromeOS definitely needs a more unified, single place to find applications, and this seems like exactly what&#8217;s happening here.

## I Bought a Steam Deck

date: 2024-05-09, from: Jessica Smith's blog

<p>A couple of days I posted about <a href="https://www.jayeless.net/2024/05/getting-back-into-the-sims-games.html">wanting to get back into The Sims (2 &amp; 4)</a>. What I didn&rsquo;t mention then, that I will now, is I&rsquo;d kinda been wanting to get back into casual gaming already. I&rsquo;ve never been a real Gamer™ exactly, but I have purchased a bunch of indie games through Steam and itch.io over the years, and spent a fair bit of time&hellip; you know&hellip; casually gaming. For the most part I like turn-based <abbr title="Role-Playing Games">RPGs</abbr>, simulation games, and the occasional puzzle game. Nothing with too grim or dreary an atmosphere. And, of course, I&rsquo;ve only really played games on computers (well, and the occasional mobile game, I guess). My parents never let us have a gaming console growing up, and with my disability it&rsquo;s too hard to use a controller anyway – my right hand just isn&rsquo;t dexterous enough to operate its side of the controls.</p>
<p>When I was playing a lot of indie games between about 2018–2020, I mostly did so on a desktop computer, running Linux. Not only did a ton of indie games support Linux natively, but Steam rolled out an embedded implementation of Wine called Proton, so most games <em>without</em> official Linux versions worked on Linux, too. I mean, in 2017 I&rsquo;d been using PlayOnLinux to play <cite>The Sims 4</cite>, so I already knew Wine wasn&rsquo;t too bad by that time, but I guess Steam&rsquo;s real triumph was in rolling the compatibility layer into the client, moving a lot of the hassle behind the scenes and out of the player&rsquo;s way. Even though I haven&rsquo;t been playing games so much since 2020, as I understand it, Proton has just got better and smoother ever since, such that these days the only games that really don&rsquo;t work with it are always-online multiplayer games with kernel-level anticheat, which I don&rsquo;t play, anyway. At any rate, even five years ago, life as a Linux-using indie gamer was good.</p>
<p><em>But</em>, time passes. I stopped being able to use that desktop so much when a) the monitor broke and, because it was within warranty, I spent a couple of months working through the warranty process with the retailer instead of just buying a new one; and b) Viv started working from home a lot when the Covid pandemic began, and commandeered that desk and computer for himself. I started using a MacBook Air as my primary computer, and switching back and forth between it and the desktop was a bit of a hassle, and since the only thing the desktop was really <em>better</em> for was playing games, I just&hellip; stopped doing that so much. I could still play a number of games on the Mac anyway&hellip; just not the more demanding ones, but also not the ones <em>so</em> undemanding that they only had 32-bit versions, and definitely not the ones that lack native Mac versions. (There&rsquo;s no equivalent of Proton for Mac.) But a few games, sure.</p>
<p>Anyway, getting to the Steam Deck. It had been playing on my mind for a while that I really did have this backlog of games that I should probably work through at some point. The desktop has become really inconvenient to use (and as I mentioned in the Sims post, its Linux install is currently not even working properly, for reasons I have not been able to work out), and my MacBook Air isn&rsquo;t designed for gaming. I&rsquo;d kind of presumed that the eventual answer would be to buy <em>another</em> Linux computer – preferably a laptop, for the portability – but a gaming laptop is like AUD$3000 and not even really very portable and honestly I didn&rsquo;t even <em>want</em> a whole new computer, just a gaming device, and then one day the obvious answer finally hit me&hellip; a Steam Deck. Duh!</p>
<p>Valve, for some reason, has declined to sell Steam Decks in Australia, but you can easily buy grey-imported ones. Last week, after about a month of dithering, I took the plunge and ordered one – one of the new OLED screen ones, with 512GB storage space. Today, it arrived!</p>

  loading="lazy" class="u-photo u-featured"></a>
<p>There are a number of reasons I think the Steam Deck is a very exciting device. Firstly, it&rsquo;s purpose-built to make it really easy to just pick up and jump straight into a game, suspend and resume as needed, etc.. It&rsquo;s all the convenience of picking up your phone to scroll social media, except doing something that is actually fun instead of doomscrolling social media. You can use it easily on the couch (well, maybe not if your cat is as obsessed with sitting on your lap as mine, but in theory). It&rsquo;s just like&hellip; if one of the biggest obstacles to me working through my game backlog is the <em>hassle</em>, the Steam Deck should really help with that.</p>
<p>Secondly, it offers a lot of different ways to control your games (D-pad, joysticks, A/B/X/Y buttons, trackpads, a touchscreen, bumper buttons&hellip;) and <strong>they are all reconfigurable</strong>! There is <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2804823261">a very detailed guide on the Steam Community site<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&thinsp;<svg style="height: 0.7em; width: 0.7em;" focusable="false" data-prefix="fas" data-icon="external-link-alt" class="svg-inline--fa fa-external-link-alt fa-w-16" role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><title>(external link)</title><path fill="currentColor" d="M432,320H400a16,16,0,0,0-16,16V448H64V128H208a16,16,0,0,0,16-16V80a16,16,0,0,0-16-16H48A48,48,0,0,0,0,112V464a48,48,0,0,0,48,48H400a48,48,0,0,0,48-48V336A16,16,0,0,0,432,320ZM488,0h-128c-21.37,0-32.05,25.91-17,41l35.73,35.73L135,320.37a24,24,0,0,0,0,34L157.67,377a24,24,0,0,0,34,0L435.28,133.32,471,169c15,15,41,4.5,41-17V24A24,24,0,0,0,488,0Z"></path></svg></span></a>. Like I mentioned in my introduction paragraph, I&rsquo;ve never been able to play with a video game controller and I wanted to make sure I wasn&rsquo;t going to have any accessibility issues with the Steam Deck. Well, I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;d enable me to play the kinds of fast-paced action games or high-precision platformers that I don&rsquo;t feel able to play already, but you can totally do things like tell the D-pad to work as A/B/X/Y and use the left joystick for directions so you can control a game entirely from the left side of the device. No problem. Plus, with any game that&rsquo;s designed to work entirely with a mouse, you can just use the touchscreen. I think it&rsquo;s really cool just how customisable the Deck is in this regard.</p>
<p>And <em>thirdly</em>, I love the fact that the Steam Deck is really just a Linux computer under the hood, after all. If you remember my post about the Sims the other day, and how miffed I was that I couldn&rsquo;t play my copy of <cite>The Sims 2 Ultimate Collection</cite> on my Mac, you&rsquo;ll be pleased to hear that one <strong>can</strong> play it on the Steam Deck. There is <a href="https://github.com/voicemxil/TS2-Starter-Pack/wiki/Linux-Specifc-Setup-Steps">a brief guide here<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&thinsp;<svg style="height: 0.7em; width: 0.7em;" focusable="false" data-prefix="fas" data-icon="external-link-alt" class="svg-inline--fa fa-external-link-alt fa-w-16" role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><title>(external link)</title><path fill="currentColor" d="M432,320H400a16,16,0,0,0-16,16V448H64V128H208a16,16,0,0,0,16-16V80a16,16,0,0,0-16-16H48A48,48,0,0,0,0,112V464a48,48,0,0,0,48,48H400a48,48,0,0,0,48-48V336A16,16,0,0,0,432,320ZM488,0h-128c-21.37,0-32.05,25.91-17,41l35.73,35.73L135,320.37a24,24,0,0,0,0,34L157.67,377a24,24,0,0,0,34,0L435.28,133.32,471,169c15,15,41,4.5,41-17V24A24,24,0,0,0,488,0Z"></path></svg></span></a>, which links to another, seemingly more detailed, guide on YouTube. The process isn&rsquo;t quite as easy as &ldquo;find game in Steam store, purchase, install&rdquo; of course, but it&rsquo;s doable! You can also use your Steam Deck to play games from other online stores like itch.io or GOG, you can connect to most providers of cloud storage you might use to share data painlessly with your other computers, and you can install and use other software beyond games – pretty much anything available on Linux. You can connect peripherals like a keyboard, external monitor and mouse/touchpad and play like on a more traditional computer if you want. It&rsquo;s very flexible. And much, much cheaper than a gaming laptop 😁</p>
<p>At approx. AUD$1,075, it was still a bit of a splurge, but I haven&rsquo;t treated myself to any &ldquo;new shinies&rdquo; since 2020, and honestly I&rsquo;m excited to get into this thing. Let&rsquo;s see how it goes!</p>

Adam Kirsch: In his poem “Little Gidding,” written during World War II, T. S. Eliot wrote that the Cavaliers and Puritans who fought in England’s Civil War, in the 17th century, now “are folded in a single party.” The same already seems true of Vendler and Perloff. Today college students are fleeing humanities majors, and [&#8230;]

## PostgreSQL 16.3, 15.7, 14.12, 13.15, and 12.19 Released!

date: 2024-05-09, from: PostgreSQL News

<p>The PostgreSQL Global Development Group has released an update to all supported
versions of PostgreSQL, including 16.3, 15.7, 14.12, 13.15, and 12.19.
This release fixes one security vulnerability and over 55 bugs reported
over the last several months.</p>
<p>A security vulnerability was found in the system views
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/view-pg-stats-ext.html"><code>pg_stats_ext</code></a>
and <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/view-pg-stats-ext-exprs.html"><code>pg_stats_ext_exprs</code></a>,
potentially allowing authenticated database users to see data they don't have
sufficient privileges to view. The fix for this vulnerability only fixes
fresh PostgreSQL installations, namely those that are created with the
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-initdb.html"><code>initdb</code></a> utility
after this fix is applied. If you have a current PostgreSQL installation and are
concerned about this issue, please follow the instructions in the "Updating"
section for remediation steps.</p>

order to apply this update release; you may simply shutdown PostgreSQL and
update its binaries.</p>
<p>For existing installations that are impacted by CVE-2024-4317 that wish to
remediate the issue, you will have to perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Find the SQL script <code>fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql</code> in the <code>share</code> directory of
your PostgreSQL installation (e.g. in <code>/usr/share/postgresql/</code>), or download it
from the PostgreSQL git repository from one of the URLs below. You will need to
use the script that matches your major version:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=blob;f=src/backend/catalog/fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql;hb=refs/heads/REL_16_STABLE">PostgreSQL 16</a>: <a href="https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=blob;f=src/backend/catalog/fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql;hb=refs/heads/REL_16_STABLE">https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=blob;f=src/backend/catalog/fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql;hb=refs/heads/REL_16_STABLE</a></p>
</li>
<li><a href="https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=blob;f=src/backend/catalog/fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql;hb=refs/heads/REL_15_STABLE">PostgreSQL 15</a>: <a href="https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=blob;f=src/backend/catalog/fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql;hb=refs/heads/REL_15_STABLE">https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=blob;f=src/backend/catalog/fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql;hb=refs/heads/REL_15_STABLE</a></li>
<li><a href="https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=blob;f=src/backend/catalog/fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql;hb=refs/heads/REL_14_STABLE">PostgreSQL 14</a>: <a href="https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=blob;f=src/backend/catalog/fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql;hb=refs/heads/REL_14_STABLE">https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=blob;f=src/backend/catalog/fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql;hb=refs/heads/REL_14_STABLE</a></li>
</ol>
<p>From the above URLs, you can click the URL that says "raw" to download a version
that you can copy and paste.</p>
<p>Be sure to use the script appropriate to your PostgreSQL major version. If you
do not see this file, either your version is not vulnerable (only PostgreSQL 14,
15, and 16 are affected) or your minor version is too old to have the fix.</p>
<ol>
<li>In each database of the cluster, run the <code>fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql</code> script as
a database superuser. For example, in <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html"><code>psql</code></a>,
with the file located in <code>/usr/share/postgresql/</code>, this command would look like:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>\i /usr/share/postgresql/fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql</code></p>
<ol>
<li>You must also execute this script in the <code>template0</code> and <code>template1</code>
databases, or the vulnerability will still exist in databases you create later.
To fix <code>template0</code>, you'll need to temporarily allow it accept connections. You
can do this with the following command:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>ALTER DATABASE template0 WITH ALLOW_CONNECTIONS true;</code></p>
<p>After executing the <code>fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql</code> script in <code>template0</code> and
<code>template1</code>, you should revoke the ability for <code>template0</code> to accept
connections. You can do this with the following command:</p>
<p><code>ALTER DATABASE template0 WITH ALLOW_CONNECTIONS false;</code></p>
<p>Users who have skipped one or more update releases may need to run additional
post-update steps; please see the release notes from earlier versions for
details.</p>

## Integrity of the Scholarly Record (ISR): what do research institutions think?

date: 2024-05-09, from: Crossref Blog

<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/frankfurt-isr-roundtable-event-2023/" target="_blank">we reported on the roundtable discussion event</a> that we had organised in Frankfurt on the heels of the Frankfurt Book Fair 2023. This event was the second in the series of roundtable events that we are holding with our community to hear from you how we can all work together to preserve the integrity of the scholarly record - you can read more about insights from these events and about ISR in <a href="https://www.crossref.org/categories/research-integrity/" target="_blank">this series of blogs</a>.</p>
<p>Research institutions are one of the most important stakeholders in the endeavour of research integrity, and any conversation around ISR is incomplete without the views of this key community. This fact was acknowledged at the second ISR roundtable event, and one of the main takeaways from the discussions was to make more focused efforts to hear the viewpoints of researchers and academics.</p>
<p>As the first step in this direction, we organised an online discussion on the integrity of the scholarly record, to which we invited: researchers and academics, research integrity experts based at academic institutions, Crossref members, as well as other organisations working on this topic such as COPE and Digital Science. The primary objective of this event was to hear from this community their perspectives on preserving and leveraging the integrity of the scholarly record and to identify opportunities for collaboration in this area. To ensure common ground, we also wanted to share information about Crossref metadata, the Research Nexus vision, and our position and role in the integrity of the scholarly record.</p>
<p>To facilitate this, the event started with an introduction by Kora Korzec, Head of Community Engagement and Communication at Crossref, to our <a href="https://www.crossref.org/about/" target="_blank">mission and vision</a> and the importance of capturing the relationships between the objects, people and places involved in research through the <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/research-nexus/" target="_blank">Research Nexus</a>. Amanda Bartell, Head of Member Experience, was next and she spoke about <a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/isr-part-one-what-is-our-role-in-preserving-the-integrity-of-the-scholarly-record/" target="_blank">the scholarly record and the role that Crossref plays in preserving the record’s integrity</a>. In her presentation, Amanda emphasised that Crossref’s role is not to assess the quality of content deposited by the members but rather to provide infrastructure that enables the community to provide and use metadata about the scholarly content produced by members. It’s important not to put up barriers to entry, but to work with all publishers to encourage best practices.</p>
<p>Dominika Tkaczyk, Head of Strategic Initiatives, shared details of a few Crossref projects that focus on monitoring and improving metadata completeness, thereby supporting ISR. These projects include improving the Participation Reports, using metadata matching to discover new relationships (e.g., <a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/discovering-relationships-between-preprints-and-journal-articles/" target="_blank">preprint <em>published</em> as work</a>, <a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/the-more-the-merrier-or-how-more-registered-grants-means-more-relationships-with-outputs/" target="_blank">work <em>supported</em> by funder</a>, etc), and importing more retractions and other updates from the Retraction Watch database that was <a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/news-crossref-and-retraction-watch/" target="_blank">acquired and made openly available by Crossref</a>. Dominika used these examples to highlight the ways in which open and complete metadata can help in uncovering large scale trends and systemic concerns. The final speaker was Amanda French, <a href="https://ror.org/" target="_blank">ROR</a> Technical Community Manager, who introduced the audience to the Research Organization Registry, or ROR.</p>
<p>To accomplish the primary aim of the event, which was to hear the community’s viewpoints, the participants were divided into breakout groups for discussions and given three prompts to answer. The rest of the blog is a summary of what we heard from the participants.</p>
<h3 id="1-is-crossrefs-role-what-you-expected-what-surprised-you-what-are-we-missing">1. Is Crossref’s role what you expected? What surprised you? What are we missing?</h3>
<p>An overarching sentiment from the academics in the audience was that Crossref does so much more than is known to researchers! They were surprised by the range of activities underway at Crossref. At the same time, there were calls for Crossref to play a bigger role. Suggestions included playing a leadership role in deciding which metadata elements are a priority, providing guidance on the main metadata components important for signalling trust, playing a greater role in connecting various identifiers to ensure that relationships between different content types are preserved well, and to coordinate the efforts being taken by institutions, publishers and service providers around research integrity, by virtue of Crossref’s unique position in the community. There was a broad agreement that by providing the essential infrastructure, Crossref acts as the base upon which other actors in the scholarly community can build.</p>
<h3 id="2-what-metadata-elements-do-you-consider-important-for-signalling-trust">2. What metadata elements do you consider important for signalling trust?</h3>
<p>Many participants spoke about the various ways in which author identity and affiliation are important as trust signals. Being able to identify when an author has changed institutions, or being able to make a distinction between authors who have the same name is important. Author affiliations that are authentic and verified would go a long way in establishing trust.</p>
<p>Multiple assertions, e.g. for affiliations, would be welcome. The use cases for this could be when research starts at one institution and is carried over to another, or when researchers affiliated with an institution may perform part of the research overseas. Some of the participants, who actively investigate research data, shared that abstracts are valuable because they can be used for large scale analyses related to research integrity.</p>
<p>Other metadata elements that came up during this discussion were data on peer review, ethics approval, patient and donor consent in medical research, editorial boards (especially of special issues), pre-registration, funding metadata, datasets and programming scripts.</p>
<h3 id="3-what-value-do-you-see-in-the-integrity-and-completeness-of-the-scholarly-record-in-the-way-you-operate-how-do-you-contribute-to-it-how-can-it-support-you-to-achieve-your-own-goals">3. What value do you see in the integrity and completeness of the scholarly record in the way you operate? How do you contribute to it? How can it support you to achieve your own goals?</h3>
<p>Participants acknowledged that integrity of the metadata and the scholarly record is essential. Ensuring this integrity is a dynamic process, much akin to the concept of organised scepticism which is the notion that all scientific work should be trusted subject to its verification. Several ideas were shared on how to progress the integrity and completeness of the scholarly record. One recommendation was to use multiple metadata trust markers as that can make it harder for bad actors to game the system, but this may run the risk of making things complicated. Another suggestion was to make metadata part of the onboarding procedure- by gathering staff ORCID iDs during the onboarding process and sharing the institutional ROR ID with staff to promote its use, institutions can ensure that this information is routinely made available. The metadata deposited with Crossref should be integrated with downstream workflows to better facilitate the use of this rich metadata. An example of this is to integrate Crossmark with other research tools such as reference management software.</p>
<p>The participants acknowledged that this discussion underlined for them the fact that having identifiers in itself is not an indicator of quality and that the underlying metadata records and wider context is key to understanding trustworthiness of the content.</p>
<p>This event was a good first step towards engaging researchers and academics in the conversation about ISR. It connected folks working in different parts of the world who are united by their interest in research integrity. There was good engagement among all and commitment to continue these conversations in the future, with many participants planning to connect at the <a href="https://wcri2024.org/" target="_blank">World Conference on Research Integrity</a> in June (I’ll be attending as well, for anyone who wants to continue the conversation - along with my colleagues Fabienne and Evans).</p>
<p>At Crossref, we plan on continuing these conversations with all segments of the community to understand their needs and perceptions around metadata. The greater the awareness about the importance of metadata and its applications, including for research integrity, the richer the metadata that we are able to collect together. This will lead to building a comprehensive Research Nexus and emergence of more relationships therein. Please write in response to this post on our Community Forum if you have any thoughts on this as we’d love to hear from you.</p>

## Did GitHub Copilot really increase my productivity?

date: 2024-05-08, from: OS News

Yuxuan Shui, the developer behind the X11 compositor picom (a fork of Compton) published a blog post detailing their experiences with using GitHub Copilot for a year. I had free access to GitHub Copilot for about a year, I used it, got used to it, and slowly started to take it for granted, until one day it was taken away. I had to re-adapt to a life without Copilot, but it also gave me a chance to look back at how I used Copilot, and reflect &#8211; had Copilot actually been helpful to me? Copilot definitely feels a little bit magical when it works. It&#8217;s like it plucked code straight from my brain and put it on the screen for me to accept. Without it, I find myself getting grumpy a lot more often when I need to write boilerplate code &#8211; &#8220;Ugh, Copilot would have done it for me!&#8221;, and now I have to type it all out myself. That being said, the answer to my question above is a very definite &#8220;no, I am more productive without it&#8221;. Let me explain. ↫ Yuxuan Shui The two main reasons why Shui eventually realised Copilot was slowing them down were its unpredictability, and its slowness. It&#8217;s very difficult to understand when, exactly, Copilot will get things right, which is not a great thing to have to deal with when you&#8217;re writing code. They also found Copilot incredibly slow, with its suggestions often taking 2-3 seconds or longer to appear &#8211; much slower than the suggestions from the clangd language server they use. Of course, everybody&#8217;s situation will be different, and I have a suspicion that if you&#8217;re writing code in incredibly popular languages, say, Python or JavaScript, you&#8217;re going to get more accurate and possibly faster suggestions from Copilot. As Shui notes, it probably also doesn&#8217;t help that they&#8217;re writing an independent X11 compositor, something very few people are doing, meaning Copilot hasn&#8217;t been trained on it, which in turn means the tool probably has no clue what&#8217;s going on when Shui is writing their code. As an aside, my opinion on GitHub Copilot is clear &#8211; it&#8217;s quite possibly the largest case of copyright infringement in human history, and in its current incarnation it should not be allowed to continue to operate. As I wrote over a year ago: If Microsoft or whoever else wants to train a coding “AI” or whatever, they should either be using code they own the copyright to, get explicit permission from the rightsholders for “AI” training use (difficult for code from larger projects), or properly comply with the terms of the licenses and automatically add the terms and copyright notices during autocomplete and/or properly apply copyleft to the newly generated code. Anything else is a massive copyright violation and a direct assault on open source. Let me put it this way – the code to various versions of Windows has leaked numerous times. What if we train an “AI” on that leaked code and let everyone use it? Do you honestly think Microsoft would not sue you into the stone age? ↫ Thom Holwerda It&#8217;s curious that as far as I know, Copilot has not been trained on Microsoft&#8217;s own closed-source code, say, to Windows or Office, while at the same time the company claims Copilot is not copyright infringement or a massive open source license violation machine. If what Copilot does is truly fair use, as Microsoft claims, why won&#8217;t Microsoft use its own closed-source code for training? We all know the answer. Deeply questionable legality aside, do any of you use Copilot? Has it had any material impact on your programming work? Is its use allowed by your employer, or do you only use it for personal projects at home?

## Raspberry Pi Connect: remote desktop for your Pi

date: 2024-05-08, from: OS News

Today we’re pleased to announce the beta release of Raspberry Pi Connect: a secure and easy-to-use way to access your Raspberry Pi remotely, from anywhere on the planet, using just a web browser. It’s often extremely useful to be able to access your Raspberry Pi’s desktop remotely. There are a number of technologies which can be used to do this, including VNC, and of course the X protocol itself. But they can be hard to configure, particularly when you are attempting to access a machine on a different local network; and of course with the transition to Wayland in Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm, classic X remote desktop support is no longer available. We wanted to be able to provide you with this functionality with our usual “it just works” approach. Enter Raspberry Pi Connect. ↫ Gordon Hollingworth Pi Connect uses WebRTC, and a daemon running on your Pi listens for incoming screensharing requests from the Raspberry Pi website to connect the VNC server on your Pi to the VNC client running in your browser. The service is in beta, it&#8217;s free, but the one major downside is that for now, there&#8217;s only one TURN server for this service, located in the UK, but they might set up more of them if demand is high enough. If you want to try this service on your own Pi running Raspberry Pi OS, you&#8217;re going to need to be using a Raspberry Pi 5, 4, or 400, using the latest version of the operating system running Wayland. Update your operating system, install the rpi-connect package, reboot, and you&#8217;re good to go.

## US revokes Intel, Qualcomm’s export licenses to sell to China’s Huawei, sources say

date: 2024-05-08, from: OS News

The U.S. has revoked licenses that allowed companies including Intel and Qualcomm to ship chips used for laptops and handsets to sanctioned Chinese telecoms equipment maker Huawei Technologies, three people familiar with the matter said. ↫ Alexandra Alper, Fanny Potkin, David Shepardson The timing of this news is very interesting, as despite the massive sanctions the United States levied against Huawei, the company seems to be doing really well, with its smartphone business seeing massive gains in the Chinese market, at the expense of everyone else. This proves that Huawei does not need access to western chips and technologies to be successful, which must definitely sting in the US and Europe. Strong financial results, using hardware and chips designed not by western companies but by Chinese ones, combined with the only mobile operating system that has any serious potential to at least somewhat threaten Android and iOS. The various sanctions were clearly intended to hurt Huawei and possibly contain it to just China, but it seems they&#8217;re not having their desired effect at all.

                <p>Sometimes you have to listen to the messages life sends your way. And today that message is that I have to write something about guestbooks. In less than 2 hours, two emails landed in my inbox—I love emails, if you want to get in touch please <a href="mailto:hello@manuelmoreale.com">do send one</a>—both on the topic of guestbooks.</p>
<p>The first one was from <a href="https://bjhess.com">Barry</a>. His site now has a <a href="https://bjhess.com/guestbook">lovely guestbook</a> that I haven’t signed yet because I want to come up with a nice drawing for it. Barry also works on a blog platform called <a href="https://pika.page">Pika</a>, worth checking out if you want to start a blog—you should—and you’re considering a hosted solution.</p>
<p>The second email was a ping from <a href="https://devastatia.com/123guestbook-shutting-down">Devastatia’s website</a>. She wrote a post on the subject of guestbooks because apparently <a href="https://www.123guestbook.com">123guestbook.com</a>, one of the OG sites, <a href="https://www.123guestbook.com/news.php?id=closure">is shutting down</a>. If for some reason you were using it to power your guestbook you should consider exporting your content and preserving all the signatures in some way.</p>

## NetBSD 8.3 released, marks the end of the 8.0 branch

date: 2024-05-08, from: OS News

NetBSD 10 and NetBSD 9.4 were only recently released, leaving one final branch to receive what will be its last update: NetBSD 8.3. NetBSD 8.0 was originally released in 2018, so this final release marks six years of updates, which is a good track record, especially now that two newer main releases are available to choose from. With 8.3 being the final release, this means no more regular or security updates, pkgsrc no longer supports the 8.0 branch either &#8211; so yeah, time to upgrade. NetBSD 8.3 brings various updates and bug fixes for libX11, xterm, tmux, and httpd, and the root name servers and time zone data have been updated to their latest iterations as well. There&#8217;s of course a full list of changes to peruse through if you want to know every little detail that&#8217;s changed. You can update your installation in-place, of course, or download the installation media for 8.3 from one of the many mirrors.

## Just a bunch of scanners (JBOS?)

date: 2024-05-08, from: OS News

This is the story on how I spent far too much money and time getting a scanner to work over iSCSI so that I could prove “Chris O” wrong on StackExchange. The TL;DR is that yes scanners work fine over iSCSI. ↫ xssfox The next step is connecting a bunch of flatbed scanners to a disk array enclosure, but that turns out to be quite an expensive little exercise. Regardless, this is absolutely wild, and I love it when people go to great lengths just to prove that something pointless can actually be done. Bravo.

<h1 id="2024-05-04-any-dice">2024-05-04 Any Dice</h1>

<p>I have the greatest respect for the anydice.com website by Jasper Flick. So cool!</p>

<p>Recently, <a class="account" href="https://dice.camp/@vdonnut" title="@vdonnut@dice.camp">@vdonnut</a> wondered about a dice pool roll where a result of 5 or 6 on a six-sided die is a success.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://anydice.com/program/36526">answer</a>:</p>

<pre><code>function: ROLL:s count fives and above {
 result: (ROLL &gt;= 5)
}

loop N over {1..10} {
  output [Nd6 count fives and above] named &quot;successes for [N] dice&quot;
}
</code></pre>

## LPCAMM2 memory is finally here

date: 2024-05-07, from: OS News

But today we got our hands on LPCAMM2 for the first time, and this looks like the future to us. LPCAMM2 is a totally modular, repairable, upgradeable memory standard for laptops, using the latest LPDDR chips for maximum speed and efficiency. So instead of overpaying (or under-speccing) based on guesswork about your future memory needs, you’ll hopefully be able to buy your next laptop and then install more RAM as needed. Imagine that! ↫ Carsten Frauenheim LPDDR memory, used in modern laptops, has been difficult &#8211; or impossible &#8211; to upgrade because its low power nature means it needs to be located as close to the processor as possible with short traces, since the longer the traces, the more power is needed to maintain signal integrity between the processor and RAM. This would defeat the entire purpose of low-power DDR memory to begin with. Originally developed by Dell and eventually adopted by JEDEC and the wider industry, LPCAMM2 solves this problem by using screw-down RAM modules located right next to the processor. These modules can, like regular memory modules, be replaced and upgraded when needed or desired. This is a great leap forward, and I really, really hope we&#8217;re going to see quick, widespread adoption.

## GCC 14.1 released

date: 2024-05-07, from: OS News

GCC 14.1 has been released, and it should come as no surprise that the new features are not exactly something I, someone who doesn&#8217;t program, can properly parse. So, here&#8217;s the three items GCC itself thought were important to list first. The C frontend when targeting standards newer than C89 now considers many non-standard constructs as errors that were previously only warnings. See https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-14/porting_to.html#warnings-as-errors for more details. C23 _BitInt Bit-precise integer types are now supported, for now only on IA-32, x86-64 and AArch64. The C++ frontend now implements several C++26 features, some missing C++23 bits and defect report resolutions. Diagnostics involving C++ templates now quote source from the instantiation context. The libstdc++exp.a library now includes all symbols for the Filesystem TS and the experimental symbols for the C++23 std::stacktrace class, so -lstdc++exp can be used instead of -lstdc++fs. The libstdc++_libbacktrace.a library is not longer installed. Improved experimental support for C++20, C++23, and C++26. Updated parallel algorithms that are compatible with oneTBB. ↫ GCC 14.1 release announcement GCC 14.1 is available for download, of course, but most of us will get it once it hits our distribution&#8217;s package repositories.

## Stack Overflow signs deal with OpenAI, bans users trying to alter answers

date: 2024-05-07, from: OS News

We&#8217;re all aware of Stack Overflow &#8211; it&#8217;s a place where programmers and regular users can ask technical questions, and get answers from anyone who thinks they know the answer. Stack Overflow has become so ubiquitous among programmers and developers, the concept of &#8220;I just copied the code off Stack Overflow&#8221; has become a consistent meme to indicate you don&#8217;t fully grasp how something works, but at least it works. If you&#8217;ve ever contributed answers to Stack Overflow, you might want to consider deleting them, altering them, or perhaps even go as far as request a GDPR removal if you&#8217;re in the European Union, because Stack Overflow has just announced a close partnership with &#8220;AI&#8221; company OpenAI (or, more accurately, &#8220;Open&#8221; &#8220;AI&#8221;). Stripped of marketing speak, the gist is exactly as you&#8217;d expect: OpenAI will absorb the questions and answers on Stack Overflow into its models, whether their respective authors like it or not. As much as you may want to try and delete your answers if you&#8217;re not interesting in having your work generate profit for OpenAI, deleting popular questions and answers is not possible on Stack Overflow. The other option is altering your answers to render them useless, but it seems Stack Overflow is not going to allow you to do this, either. Ben Humphreys tried to alter his highest-rated answers, and Stack Overflow just reverted them back, and proceeded to ban him from the platform. Stack Overflow does not let you delete questions that have accepted answers and many upvotes because it would remove knowledge from the community. So instead I changed my highest-rated answers to a protest message. Within an hour mods had changed the questions back and suspended my account for 7 days. ↫ Ben Humphreys Now that they&#8217;ve made what is most likely an incredibly lucrative deal with OpenAI that&#8217;s going to net Stack Overflow&#8217;s owners boatloads of money, they obviously can&#8217;t let users delete or alter their answers to lower the monetary value of Stack Overflow&#8217;s content. Measures to prevent deletion or alteration are probably one of the clauses in the agreement between Stack Overflow and OpenAI. So there&#8217;s likely not much you can do to not have your answers sucked into OpenAI, but you should at least be aware it&#8217;s happening in case of future answers you might want to contribute.

## Breaking the Scaling Limits: New Ultralow-noise Superconducting Camera for Exoplanet Searches

date: 2024-05-07, from: NASA breaking news

When imaging faint objects such as distant stars or exoplanets, capturing every last bit of light is crucial to get the most out of a scientific mission. These cameras must be extremely low-noise, and be able to detect the smallest quantities of light—single photons.  Superconducting cameras excel in both of these criteria, but have historically […]

<p>Raspberry Pi today launched <a href="https://connect.raspberrypi.com">Raspberry Pi Connect</a>, a free remote VPN service for all Pi OS users.</p>

<p>If you create a <a href="https://id.raspberrypi.com/">Raspberry Pi ID</a>, you can sign up for Connect, install <code>rpi-connect</code> on a Pi 4 or 5 running 64-bit Pi OS 12 'Bookworm', and register that Pi with the service.</p>

<p>Then, on any other device's web browser, you can log in and remote control your Pi through Connect's web-based VNC viewer.</p>

## Running NetBSD on OmniOS using bhyve

date: 2024-05-07, from: OS News

I want to run GoToSocial on some *BSD system. Because I am who I am, I went for using NetBSD 10.0 . And because my hypervisor is running bhyve on OmniOS , you get the title of this blog post. Don’t get too anxious, it is quite straightforward. So let the journey begin. ↫ Joel Carnat Bhyve is a hypervisor originating from FreeBSD, while OmniOS is a distribution of illumos, a continuation of the last open source Solaris release from Oracle. GoToSocial, meanwhile, is an ActivityPub social network server, so it belongs in the same family as Mastodon, Glitch, Akkoma, and countless others. This guide makes this whole process look like a piece of cake, so if you&#8217;ve ever been interested in running your own ActivityPub server &#8211; read on. On a slightly related sidenote, there&#8217;s no OSNews AT instance, partly because I don&#8217;t want to deal with the moderation and costs, and partly because I&#8217;m incredibly happy being a member of Exquisite, a Glitch instance running on OpenBSD, managed by OpenBSD enthusiasts. Never say never, of course, but the odds of seeing an OSNews AT instance in the future are very slim.

BTW, I was struck that famous editor and writer <a href="https://mastodon.social/@semaforben@threads.net">Ben Smith</a> said he was ashamed at starting out as a blogger, on an MSNBC show hosted by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Scarborough">true hack</a>. The quote was from <a href="https://mastodon.social/@jeffjarvis/112399386648851185">Jeff Jarvis</a>, who like me, <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/05/06/135847.html#a140303">cross-posts</a> to a variety of social webs, presumably manually. Where did I put my comment? Hell if I know. Heh I <a href="https://mastodon.social/@jeffjarvis/112399484570566051">found</a> it. My comment: "I didn’t know he had been a blogger. So my respect for him went up dramatically in an instant, and in another instant, plummeted. What’s wrong with people?" Bad news for Ben, he's still is a blogger, btw, in his heart. I can tell. And true journalists and true bloggers share an ethos that the fakers like Morning Joe will never understand. So I guess when you're on with Joe you have to pander. Just remember Ben, we know who you are. Even if you have forgotten. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>

## Getting Back Into the Sims Games

date: 2024-05-07, from: Jessica Smith's blog

<p>Over the past couple of weeks, I&rsquo;ve felt this rising tide of nostalgia building up in me and urging me to revisit the <cite>Sims</cite> games. I used to be an avid player of <cite>The Sims 2</cite> in the late 2000s and early 2010s, playing legacy challenges (where you strive to play the same family over 10 generations) and participating in the thriving LiveJournal Sims community of the era. Around the time this nostalgic impulse started, I stumbled upon a corner of Reddit where people are still talking about, and playing, <cite>The Sims 2</cite>, and that in turn got me sucked into YouTube videos such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpEVeAeyWJHOpjr8FOkf7WTwB5YrNJ8VX">Tanic Sims 2&rsquo;s series on the borked character files of the premade hoods<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&thinsp;<svg style="height: 0.7em; width: 0.7em;" focusable="false" data-prefix="fas" data-icon="external-link-alt" class="svg-inline--fa fa-external-link-alt fa-w-16" role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><title>(external link)</title><path fill="currentColor" d="M432,320H400a16,16,0,0,0-16,16V448H64V128H208a16,16,0,0,0,16-16V80a16,16,0,0,0-16-16H48A48,48,0,0,0,0,112V464a48,48,0,0,0,48,48H400a48,48,0,0,0,48-48V336A16,16,0,0,0,432,320ZM488,0h-128c-21.37,0-32.05,25.91-17,41l35.73,35.73L135,320.37a24,24,0,0,0,0,34L157.67,377a24,24,0,0,0,34,0L435.28,133.32,471,169c15,15,41,4.5,41-17V24A24,24,0,0,0,488,0Z"></path></svg></span></a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cB67DGDXFQ">this two-hour masterpiece by April Black<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&thinsp;<svg style="height: 0.7em; width: 0.7em;" focusable="false" data-prefix="fas" data-icon="external-link-alt" class="svg-inline--fa fa-external-link-alt fa-w-16" role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><title>(external link)</title><path fill="currentColor" d="M432,320H400a16,16,0,0,0-16,16V448H64V128H208a16,16,0,0,0,16-16V80a16,16,0,0,0-16-16H48A48,48,0,0,0,0,112V464a48,48,0,0,0,48,48H400a48,48,0,0,0,48-48V336A16,16,0,0,0,432,320ZM488,0h-128c-21.37,0-32.05,25.91-17,41l35.73,35.73L135,320.37a24,24,0,0,0,0,34L157.67,377a24,24,0,0,0,34,0L435.28,133.32,471,169c15,15,41,4.5,41-17V24A24,24,0,0,0,488,0Z"></path></svg></span></a> on the scourge of hood corruption, and how many of the things Simmers long thought cause it actually don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Anyway, it made me really want to play <cite>The Sims 2</cite> again. I do actually own the Ultimate Collection via <abbr title="Electronic Arts">EA</abbr> Origin, but there was a slight problem&hellip; the computer I use is a Mac. And we do have a Linux desktop as well, and these days Wine/Proton/etc. is so good that <abbr title="The Sims 2">TS2</abbr> can easily be played on that <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr> now&hellip; but somehow that install of Linux got borked and only works in recovery mode, which is sufficient to run the Plex server I mainly use that desktop for these days, but not really good enough for <abbr title="The Sims 2">TS2</abbr>. Alas.</p>
<p>Another option would have been to purchase Aspyr&rsquo;s Mac port – the Super Collection – for AUD$50 in the App Store. I do want to admit that in principle (even though I already own the game on another platform) this seems like a worthy option. Unlike <abbr title="Electronic Arts">EA</abbr>, Aspyr has actually put the effort in to keep their port updated for new versions of Mac OS, including upgrading the game to 64 bits when Apple dropped support for 32-bit applications, and updating the game again to run natively on Apple Silicon (the M1 chips and beyond). That&rsquo;s great and they deserve to be supported for that! My reasons for not just choosing that option are a bit on the selfish and picky side. Firstly, <abbr title="Electronic Arts">EA</abbr> never allowed Aspyr to port the last couple of expansion packs (<cite>FreeTime</cite> and <cite>Apartment Life</cite>) to Mac OS, and <cite>FreeTime</cite> in particular is so fundamental to all my nostalgic memories of the game (plus, packed with quality of life features) that I just don&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;m willing to play without it. Secondly, the April Black video I linked in paragraph #1 introduced me to the fact that Macs have a hardcoded limit of approximately 10,000 files that can be open at one time&hellip; which can be a potential cause of corruption in <cite>The Sims 2</cite>, which was designed to draw on a large number of tiny, atomic files (e.g. every Sim in a neighbourhood gets its own individual file) instead of large consolidated ones. Considering that on top of that, I have a folder of all the custom content I was using at the time I stopped playing <cite>The Sims 2</cite>, which I actually think is pretty lean, and yet by itself it has 4,242 files in it&hellip; yeah, I was nervous about the possibility that playing <abbr title="The Sims 2">TS2</abbr> on a Mac would not be very sustainable for me. Alas.</p>
<p>So, I turned my sights to the newest instalment of the franchise, <cite>The Sims 4</cite>. Now I played this version of the game quite a bit in 2017–8, and I remember being impressed at first by the graphics (it&rsquo;s <em>so</em> much prettier than unmodded <abbr title="The Sims 2">TS2</abbr>) and the quality of life improvements offered by the game engine, like better routing and Sims&rsquo; new ability to multitask. However&hellip; the shine wore off. The main issue I had with <abbr title="The Sims 4">TS4</abbr> was just that it wasn&rsquo;t as <strong>fun</strong> as <abbr title="The Sims 2">TS2</abbr>. The zany shit that used to keep me so entertained as a teen was just so much rarer in <abbr title="The Sims 4">TS4</abbr>. Most Sims&rsquo; personalities were so bland, with personality points gone and replaced with just <strong>three</strong> traits (plus an aspiration trait) and no more than a handful of those traits did anything more than &ldquo;give Sims an emotion buff sometimes&rdquo;. There were no more wants and fears, just &ldquo;whims&rdquo; which were rarely interesting, and nothing bad happened if you ignored them entirely (Sims couldn&rsquo;t go into aspiration failure any more). So&hellip; I started playing a legacy in <cite>The Sims 4</cite> and did get up to generation 6. After a couple of fun generations where I really put effort into making my Sims generate drama, I got a generation where my heir had TRIPLETS and my entire game became a production line of desperately trying to build up the toddlers&rsquo; potty training skill to the point that they could at least fucking toilet themselves and it was literally a neverending process and none of my adult Sims were doing anything interesting either and I got so frustrated that I just&hellip; never opened the game again. 😅</p>
<p>That said, quite a few years have passed since 2017–8. It occurred to me that more mods might&rsquo;ve come out giving the Sims more personality and making their autonomous behaviour more individualised. It also seems like the game itself has come out with updates addressing some of the stuff I criticised (for example they supposedly replaced whims with wants &amp; fears again, and as of a recent expansion Sims can &ldquo;self-discover&rdquo; new traits?)&hellip; basically, I started to wonder if it was worth trying again.</p>
<p>So, I installed the base game via the Origin app (which supposedly already booted off everyone in favour of <abbr title="Electronic Arts">EA</abbr>&rsquo;s new app, but it hasn&rsquo;t booted <em>me</em> off) and started a new save. I haven&rsquo;t got very far into it yet, and I&rsquo;m also adding mods progressively, bit by bit, rather than adding <strong>every</strong> &ldquo;give your Sim more personality!&rdquo; mod all at once, to make the investigation easier for myself if I inadvertently add something bugged or something that conflicts with another mod. That said, some of the mods I&rsquo;m interested in playing with are:</p>

<p>Now, having said all of this&hellip; I&rsquo;m not sure how much it&rsquo;ll satisfy that part of me nostalgic for the Sims community on LiveJournal. Because a big part of my fun wasn&rsquo;t just <em>playing my game</em>, it was publishing updates on my legacy and – perhaps even more important – reading other people&rsquo;s updates on their legacy. There are sooooo many hilarious people whose legacies I used to read – hell, I started reading them even before I owned a Windows computer to play <abbr title="The Sims 2">TS2</abbr> on myself! – and I really also miss&hellip; that. For nostalgia&rsquo;s sake I went back to revisit some of them today, but between Tinypic purging old pictures, Photobucket watermarking old pictures, and LiveJournal itself becoming a gross ad-infested shell of what it once was, it was just sad. I can put together legacy updates for myself, and I can publish them on the internet (I even have <a href="https://sims.jayeless.net">a dedicated subdomain<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&thinsp;<svg style="height: 0.7em; width: 0.7em;" focusable="false" data-prefix="fas" data-icon="external-link-alt" class="svg-inline--fa fa-external-link-alt fa-w-16" role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><title>(external link)</title><path fill="currentColor" d="M432,320H400a16,16,0,0,0-16,16V448H64V128H208a16,16,0,0,0,16-16V80a16,16,0,0,0-16-16H48A48,48,0,0,0,0,112V464a48,48,0,0,0,48,48H400a48,48,0,0,0,48-48V336A16,16,0,0,0,432,320ZM488,0h-128c-21.37,0-32.05,25.91-17,41l35.73,35.73L135,320.37a24,24,0,0,0,0,34L157.67,377a24,24,0,0,0,34,0L435.28,133.32,471,169c15,15,41,4.5,41-17V24A24,24,0,0,0,488,0Z"></path></svg></span></a>, originally to host my pictures, but when LJ went downhill I started backing up the actual updates there too), but&hellip; I have no idea where a Simmer <em>shares</em> these things, these days, for potential interested readers to find. At least in 2017–8, I knew Tumblr was popular, but I tried searching tags like &ldquo;sims 4 legacy&rdquo;, &ldquo;sims 4 gameplay&rdquo; and so forth today and did not find a single &ldquo;legacy update&rdquo; as I would think of them. Mostly I found custom content, people posting their own challenge rules based on the original legacy challenge, and the occasional &ldquo;artsy&rdquo; highly edited screenshot with no or minimal commentary. I don&rsquo;t really want contextless game screenshots&hellip; I want funny shit. I want quirky Sims autonomously starting drama and being hilarious! Where is that?! Or does everyone who wants that just stick with <abbr title="The Sims 2">TS2</abbr>? Because like, at least I found <strong>one</strong> active <abbr title="The Sims 2">TS2</abbr> legacy posting updates on Reddit&hellip; actually I found an active <abbr title="The Sims 4">TS4</abbr> legacy on Reddit too, but it&rsquo;s a bit more serious and less &ldquo;this is what happened in my game lol&rdquo;. Are people just making <em>videos</em> of that style of content now, instead of screenshots with commentary, and posting them on YouTube? Because&hellip; I am not going to do that. Haha.</p>
<p>Well&hellip; anyway&hellip; step 1 is to actually play my game, right. Experiment with mods and see if it feels fun enough for me to persist with it. It&rsquo;s sad about the difficulty finding or sharing legacy updates, but it&rsquo;s really just an adjunct to actually playing the game anyway, I suppose.</p>

## The VGA attribute controller is weird

date: 2024-05-06, from: OS News

The grabber in Windows 3.1 was improved to save and restore the index register as well, but it does not attempt to restore the flip-flop state, which is significant. The problem with the VGA emulation was that it erroneously applied the flip-flop state to reads from port 3C0h, and Windows 3.1 would save the wrong index register value… but only the second time through, because the flip-flop state was different at that point. That is to say, the Windows 3.1 standard mode grabber read from port 3C0h to query the attribute controller index register state, but the emulation returned the currently selected data register contents instead. And then, when restoring the attribute controller index register the next time around, the register would be restored to the wrong value which didn’t have bit 5 set, causing the screen to go blank. ↫ Michal Necasek It&#8217;s not every day that you learn how an aspect of the workings of VGA causes a blank screen under very specific circumstances when running Windows 3.1 in Standard mode under emulation, and that this specific aspect of the workings of VGA was implemented to maintain backwards compatibility with EGA. Absolutely bonkers.

## PowerPC 40x processor support to be dropped from the Linux kernel

date: 2024-05-06, from: OS News

In addition to Linux 6.10 expected to drop support for very old DEC Alpha processors (EV5 and earlier), it looks like the PowerPC 40x (early PowerPC 400 series) processor and platform support will be retired too. Back in 2020 was a proposal for dropping PowerPC 40x support from the Linux kernel given that the code was orphaned for a long time with no apparent users. The PowerPC 40x processors were found in thin clients, set-top boxes, and other devices during the 90&#8217;s. Finally now it looks like that the PowerPC 40x removal is set to happen. ↫ Michael Larabel Spring cleaning in the hardware support department. I wonder what has more users &#8211; Windows on ARM, or Linux on PowerPC 40x.

## First-generation Windows on ARM PCs will not be able to run Windows 11 24H2

date: 2024-05-06, from: OS News

Windows 11 supports a variety of ARM processors from Qualcomm. According to the official documentation, you need a computer with the Snapdragon 850 processor inside or newer to run the current operating system officially. However, customers with PCs powered by the Snapdragon 835, the original Windows on ARM chip from 2016, can bypass hardware requirements and install Windows 11 at their own risk. Sadly, those days will be ending soon. Starting with Windows 11 version 24H2, Microsoft&#8217;s operating system requires ARM v8.1 to run. An attempt to boot it from a device with an ARM v8.0-based processor results in system crashes. For reference, the Snapdragon 835 from 2016 is a chip with Kryo 280 cores, which are derivative of ARM&#8217;s Cortex-A73 cores. ↫ Taras Buria at Neowin I&#8217;m sure all three Windows on ARM users are devastated.

## Snikket: this week’s sponsor

date: 2024-05-06, from: OS News

Snikket is a FOSS project for creating private chat spaces for small groups, such as families, friends, or clubs. It doesn’t depend on a phone number, doesn’t upload address books anywhere, and doesn’t sell data to advertisers. It supports all the features you expect, including media and voice messages, audio and video calls, end-to-end encryption, group messaging, and more. Use it from multiple devices at once with the official apps, or even with unofficial, third-party apps. Snikket is easy to self-host, and professional managed hosting is also available. Our previous sponsor, JMP, opted to donate a free week&#8217;s sponsorship to Snikket, which any paying OSNews sponsor can opt to do. This is our very small way of giving something back to the countless open source and/or smaller projects out there. Thank you Snikket for sponsoring OSNews!

## With PowerPC, Windows CE and the WiiN-PAD slate, everyone’s a WiiN-er (except Data General)

date: 2024-05-06, from: OS News

That&#8217;s right: it&#8217;s PowerPC, the most unloved of the architectures CE ever ran on — in fact, this is the first PowerPC Windows CE device I&#8217;ve ever found, and I&#8217;m the self-described biggest pro-PowerPC bigot in the world. Here&#8217;s an unusual form factor Windows CE device, running on the operating system&#8217;s least used CPU, from a storied computer company near the end of its run, intended for medical applications, produced in very small numbers and cancelled within months. What are we going to do with it? Well, what do you think we&#8217;re gonna do with it? We&#8217;re going to program it, so that we can finally have some software! And, of course, since this wacky thing was there at the bitter end, we&#8217;ll talk more about the last days of Data General and what happened next. ↫ Cameron Kaiser I knew Windows CE supported PowerPC, but I never knew any PowerPC-based Windows CE devices ever actually shipped and made it to market. Only Windows CE 2.0 seems to have supported the architecture, and it seems to have been eliminated in 3.0 and 4.0, so it&#8217;s not surprising there weren&#8217;t many PowerPC Windows CE devices out there. The device that&#8217;s the subject of this article, too, only lasted on the market for a few months, so it&#8217;s definitely a rarity.

## Palm OS gets a TOTP application

date: 2024-05-06, from: OS News

Still rocking your Palm OS device, but mutter under your breath every time you need to log into a website or service with two-factor authentication? Sick of carrying around an Android or iOS device just so you can log in on your Palm PDA? Worry no more, your prayers have been answered, you can finally throw that Android or iOS garbage into the sun. Get your 2-factor codes on your Palm, just like Google Authenticator. Unlike Hotpants (an old port of a J2ME phone app), this version takes up much less space and supports all Palm OS versions. ↫ Nathan Korth You can now generate 2FA codes on your Palm device. This is wild, and I absolutely love it. I might if set it up on one of my dozens of Palm OS devices and just put it next to my keyboard for easy access. There&#8217;s no cooler way to handle 2FA than this.

## Cross-posting in 2024

date: 2024-05-06, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Some pragmatic notes how cross-posting works these days.</p>
<p>I use regularly: Twitter, Threads, Facebook, Mastodon, Bluesky.  </p>
<p>Two that have APIs I can use: Mastodon and Bluesky.</p>
<p>I can't send images to Bluesky via their API, they broke the interface. My way of doing it is now called "legacy." The app that uses that feature doesn't work. But I don't even remotely have the time to go back and fix it.</p>
<p>The items in my <a href="http://scripting.com/?tab=links">linkblog</a> come from this flow. If it appears in my linkblog, it also appears on Masto and Bluesky.</p>
<p>When I want broader distribution, I do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open a new browser window.</li>
<li>Open a tab to Twitter usually. I don't know why.</li>
<li>I write some text into the Twitter tab.  </li>
<li>Paste an image if there is one.</li>
<li>I open another tab for Threads, Facebook, Mastodon, Bluesky. </li>
<li>I make one pass to paste the text, another to paste the image.</li>
<li>I click Send in each of the tabs, and get back to what I was doing.</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm sure a lot of people are doing something very much like this. I can actually witness Jeff Jarvis doing it. I think Jay Rosen probably is too.</p>
<p>One thing that Bluesky may not be aware of is that their character limit is signficantly lower than the others, so sometimes I can't include them in this rotation. </p>
<p>I'd love to see one of these support the features of <a href="https://textcasting.org/">textcasting</a>. I would give them 100 good netizen points for that, because it wouldn't be long before the others did it, and we'd have a much more complete network writing environment. </p>

I usually write my prompts very carefully, esp when using it to build software, but I just tried not really caring, and asking a question the way I thought of it, so it rambled a lot, was repetetive and had an error I didn't bother to correct, to see what would happen. It didn't even criticize me. It figured out what I was trying to ask/say, and gave me the answer I was looking for. Yes I am aware that all my fellow programmers taught it how to do this, though I have no idea how it does that, but it is freaking amazing. I keep finding miracles in this tech.

Bright, starry spiral arms surround an active galactic center in this new NASA Hubble Space Telescope image of the galaxy NGC 4951. Located in the Virgo constellation, NGC 4951 is located roughly 50 million light-years away from Earth. It’s classified as a Seyfert galaxy, which means that it’s an extremely energetic type of galaxy with […]

I haven’t forgotten about middlebrow matters, but right now my mind is on something else. Something related, though.  Readers of Gaudy Night (1935) will recall — stop reading if you haven’t read Gaudy Night and don’t want any spoilers — that the plot hinges on an event that occurred some years before the book’s present-day: [&#8230;]

## Random RSS & ActivityPub notes

date: 2024-05-06, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/11/27/rssClub.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Back when I did my first XML-based serialization format, I did it because the XML people were asking developers to do that. "Now you can create your own formats!" The theory was they had finished their work, XML was ready to go, and developers should start building on it. So I did, thinking in the back of my mind, "they don't really mean it." This was based on experience with commercial platform vendors who heavily evangelized their products when they were new, but took <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/umbrage">umbrage</a> at the <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/chutzpah">chutzpah</a> of the developer who thought they could do anything really useful or important, don't they know that's what BigCo's do. Anyway a few years later, that's exactly what happened. Predictably, the big companies, IBM, Microsoft, Google, Sun etc thought they should define the syndication format of the future, so they set about to do it as a "standard" and thus was born Atom. My opinion, <a href="https://this.how/standards/#1497798940000">one way is better</a> than two, and they should have jumped on the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> bandwagon. But that's not what they do. They're still <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">trying</a> to make RSS unnecessary, you think they would have figured out that there's no point in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">trying</a> to do that. It isn't going away. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span></p>
<p>I wonder if anyone has thought of working with ChatGPT or Meta.ai to create a Busy Developer's Guide to ActivityPub? Here's the prompt. "I want to write a simple bridge between my writing app and any app that runs in the Fediverse, using only ActivityPub. The operations are basically those of the MetaWeblog API, create a post, update a post. Just to start. How should it handle identity? I work in Node.js." I asked both AI tools, and the Meta.ai answer was pretty useless, but <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/3a37d2dd-a442-4d8c-b314-0c934b87f5e1?oai-dm=1">ChatGPT gave</a> what seems to be a reasonable outline for the project. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">ActivityPub</a> is a product of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture_astronaut">Architecture Astronauts</a>. Start with a simple idea but generalize it too far, so it can do everything, so much so that no one understands how to do the simple stuff. You have to understand the theory before you do can anything pragmatic. It's why I said last week that they <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/28.html#a124521">need a BDG asap</a>, with implementations in all major runtime environments. I would help them design it, I'm a fairly typical "busy developer." I would support it if it were easier to understand, thus more likely not to be revised with breakage to apps. I've also seen this happen before, in fact it happens more often than not. If you don't understand a format, you can't actually support it. This is part of the <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1997/05/07/Programmers.html#5">you can't lie to a compiler</a> axiom. </p>

## Episode 131 - Computer... Books?

date: 2024-05-05, from: Advent of Computing

<p>I've been feeling like rambling, so it's time for a classic ramble. This time we are looking at the origins of books about computers. More specifically, computer books targeted at a general audience. Along the way we stumble into the first public disclosure of digital computers, the first intentionally unimportant machine, and wild speculation about the future of mechanical brains.</p> <p>No sources listed this time, because I want the journey to be a surprise!</p>

## Thanks to our outgoing sponsor: JMP

date: 2024-05-05, from: OS News

We&#8217;d like to thank this past week&#8217;s sponsor JMP for sponsoring OSNews. As a reminder, JMP is a fully FOSS service providing a way to get a real phone number that operates over the internet using XMPP. They provide numbers in the USA and Canada with everything you need to access SMS/MMS/etc. and voice calls using your XMPP (or SIP) clients of choice across all your devices. They are committed to growing the use of open communications technology such as XMPP, ultimately working to help people move their communication off the unencrypted telephone network and onto the federated, encrypted, and diverse Jabber network. Once again, thanks to JMP for sponsoring OSNews!

## Why I run a BSD on a PC

date: 2024-05-05, from: OS News

But the biggest differential factor between BSDs and GNU/Linux is the way it is structured. In Linux, all components are designed to work together, but are completely separate. You’ve got the kernel, init systems, multimedia daemons, userland, bootloader, virtualization and containerization mechanisms, package managers, and so on. They are all separate projects with their own goals and are operated by separate entities. This is why we’ve got different Linux Distributions instead of Operating System. Everyone can take the kernel, start adding components on top of it, and a few minutes later the DistroWatch is even harder to keep up with. Each BSD on the other hand is designed as single system. All components are created and developed together. Things work together perfectly, because they are designed, coded, tested and released as one. ↫ Michał Sapka As I&#8217;ve mentioned here and there over the past few weeks, I&#8217;ve been exploring the world of BSD lately, and after bouncing of FreeBSD I&#8217;ve found a very happy home on OpenBSD. Now, this doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m now a full-time OpenBSD user or anything like that &#8211; Linux is the main operating system on my gaming PC, my laptop, and my workstation, and that&#8217;s not going to be changing any time soon. However, after installing, exploring, and using OpenBSD on a machine cobbled together from spare and older parts, I can definitely see the appeal. OpenBSD feels more coherent than a Linux distribution &#8211; I use Fedora KDE, if that matters &#8211; and the various lower-level systems seem to talk to each other in ways that make more intuitive sense than the individually developed systems in a Linux distribution do. Diving into the command-line interface of a Linux distribution can sometimes feel confusing because different tools use different conventions, because they&#8217;re developed by entirely different people and projects, with different ideas about how flags should work, how output should be presented, and so on. On OpenBSD, it seems much easier to carry over something you learn from one tool to the next. I simply feel more secure and knowledgeable, even if it&#8217;s still the same idiot me. The documentation plays a big role here. They&#8217;re in one place, written in a consistent style, and reference each other left and right, making it easy to find your way around to other commands or tools you haven&#8217;t yet considered using. On Linux, you&#8217;re going from one project&#8217;s documentation to another project&#8217;s documentation, and not only will the style change, the quality will also vary greatly. That&#8217;s not to say everything&#8217;s perfect on OpenBSD &#8211; it&#8217;s clearly a hardened server operating system, and its focus on security will definitely throw up annoying hurdles if you&#8217;re just trying to do workstation things. Firefox, for instance, is hobbled by strict security rules through unveil, which makes perfect sense for what OpenBSD is first and foremost trying to be, but if you&#8217;re just a regular user like me, it&#8217;s annoying that Firefox can only access ~/Downloads, or that it can&#8217;t set itself as the default browser so unless you disable that check, Firefox will keep complaining about it. Diving into Firefox and unveil is on my list, though, because you should be able to &#8216;fix&#8217; this. Furthermore, while every piece of software, or an equivalent, is pretty much always available for Linux, on OpenBSD it&#8217;s more hit and miss, and it seems to take a bit longer for new releases of especially bigger software packages to get updated. I mean, there&#8217;s obviously no Steam on OpenBSD, but smaller, less well-known projects generally also don&#8217;t support OpenBSD, so you&#8217;re either going to be compiling things yourself or hope someone packages it up for OpenBSD. Then there&#8217;s the various vanity things we&#8217;ve come to expect from modern Linux distributions, like slick, fully graphical boot and shutdown sequences, detailed graphical tools for managing your packages, graphical firmware and driver managers, and so on. OpenBSD has none of these things, and while that&#8217;s no issue for me, I can see how it would throw other people off. FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, and the few others often kind of get lost in all the Linux, Windows, and macOS violence, and to be quite honest &#8211; I feel like many people in the BSD community seem mostly okay with that. If you&#8217;ve never spent any serious time using any of the BSDs, but you&#8217;re interested in operating systems and don&#8217;t mind spending a few hours learning how to manipulate your system through CLI tools &#8211; dive in. There&#8217;s a ton of fun to be had, and things to learn. For now, I&#8217;m continuing my exploration of OpenBSD, and if things keep going as well as they are, I may consider at least switching over the workstation in my office from Fedora KDE to OpenBSD &#8211; but I highly doubt it&#8217;ll ever make its way to my gaming desktop or my laptop.

## The Game of Trees version control system

date: 2024-05-05, from: OS News

Game of Trees (Got) is a version control system which prioritizes ease of use and simplicity over flexibility. Got is still under development; it is being developed on OpenBSD and its main target audience are OpenBSD developers. Got uses Git repositories to store versioned data. Git can be used for any functionality which has not yet been implemented in Got. It will always remain possible to work with both Got and Git on the same repository. ↫ Game of Trees website OpenBSD is developing Game of Trees because they want a version control system that adheres to OpenBSD coding conventions, implements various OpenBSD security practices, and uses nothing but BSD-licensed code. It&#8217;s important to note, as its developers make very clear, that GoT is not in any way intended as a replacement for git.

## X.Org on NetBSD: the state of things

date: 2024-05-05, from: OS News

The big question &#8211; does all this have a future? The good news is that all new hardware has generic support in X. Someone writes either a modesetting kernel driver or a classical wsdisplay kernel driver and they will be automatically supported by the associated drivers in X. The bad news is that to have applications running we require access to a larger open source ecosystem, and that ecosystem has a lot of churn and is easily distracted by shiny new squirrels. The process of upstreaming stuff to X.Org is an ongoing process, but it&#8217;s likely we&#8217;ll run into things that will never be suitable for upstream. ↫ Nia Alarie on the NetBSD blog I had no idea NetBSD did such heavy customisations of its X.Org implementation, many of which have never made their way upstream. The project also maintains support for several older GPUs, uses its own input driver, and more &#8211; it&#8217;s quite impressive.

## Dillo 3.1.0 released: first release since 2015

date: 2024-05-05, from: OS News

Do any of you remember the browser Dillo? The project&#8217;s been through a rough few years after the main developer of the layout engine sadly passed away, the lead developer disappeared from the project, the dillo.org domain was lost and taken over by spammers &#8211; but now there&#8217;s new people at the helm, and the browser just released it first new version since 2015. Dillo 3.1.0 brings a whole host of new features and improvements. Dillo is open source, uses the FLTK toolkit, and runs on Linux, BSD, MacOS, Windows (Cygwin), and more.

## A quick light-dark() experiment

date: 2024-05-05, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>I wanted to experiment with the new CSS function <code>light-dark()</code> and get a sense of how to use it in a CSS architecture of nested (web) components. I think it’s going to be a powerful tool in <a href="https://web.dev/articles/new-responsive">the new responsive</a> world of component architecture but I don’t want to recommend something unless I have experience with it in a project first.</p>
<p>My first pass was to add <code>light-dark()</code> to my components…</p>
<div class="language-css highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="css"><span class="c">/* global.css */</span>
<span class="nd">:root</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="py">--dark</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">#000</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="py">--light</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">#fff</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="c">/* Inside &lt;my-component&gt;'s Shadow DOM */</span>
<span class="nd">:host</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nl">background-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">light-dark</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">--light</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">--dark</span><span class="p">));</span>
  <span class="nl">color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">light-dark</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">--dark</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">--light</span><span class="p">));</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>But if every component is in charge of it’s own <code>light-dark()</code> handling for <code>border</code>, <code>background</code>, and <code>color</code> on every element… the codebase will get messy managing dark mode in a lot of different places, leading to a lot of inconsistencies over time. A more elegant solution for me would be to handle this job in a single location at the root scope level and leverage the cascade a bit.</p>
<div class="language-css highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="css"><span class="nd">:root</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="py">color-scheme</span><span class="p">:</span>  <span class="n">light</span> <span class="n">dark</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="py">--surface-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">light-dark</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="m">#fff</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">#000</span> <span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="py">--text-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">light-dark</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="m">#000</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">#fff</span> <span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The nice thing about using <code>light-dark()</code> at the root token level is your components can be dumber. You provide default light-dark experience and, like good children, your components abide in their parent’s decision. Of course, due to the nature of CSS custom properties, your components aren’t locked into the system and your component level styles can opt out (read: not include) or override the global variables if necessary.</p>
<div class="language-css highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="css"><span class="c">/* Inside &lt;my-component&gt;'s Shadow DOM */</span>
<span class="nd">:host</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nl">background</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">--surface-color</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="nl">color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">--text-color</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="c">/* this is a real example from my past */</span>
<span class="nd">:host</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="nt">theme</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">"lunar-new-year"</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="py">--surface-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="no">red</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="py">--text-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="no">black</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>At this point in the experiment I was pleased with the results… until I deployed it to production. I overestimated the browser support for <code>light-dark()</code> and it didn’t work on my phone running Safari 17.4 (but it’s coming in Safari 17.5). I replicated the issue by changing <code>light-dark()</code> to <code>light-d0rk()</code> to verify and fixed it by adding a tried-and-true CSS <code>@supports</code> query.</p>
<div class="language-css highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="css"><span class="nd">:root</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="py">--surface-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">#000</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="py">--text-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">#fff</span><span class="p">;</span>

	<span class="c">/* NOTE: For Safari 17.4 (2024-05) */</span>
  <span class="err">@supports</span> <span class="err">(</span><span class="nl">color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">light-dark</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="no">black</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="no">white</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="err">{</span>
    <span class="n">color-scheme</span><span class="p">:</span>  <span class="n">light</span> <span class="n">dark</span><span class="p">;</span>
	  <span class="py">--surface-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">light-dark</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="m">#fff</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">#000</span> <span class="p">);</span>
	  <span class="py">--text-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">light-dark</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="m">#000</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">#fff</span> <span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="err">}</span>

## I support the students

date: 2024-05-05, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/05/05/marchOnWashington.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">As a boomer who marched on Washington as a high school student, who started an underground newspaper, and organized student strikes, I support today's students making their political opinions heard. I also see journalists doing what they did in the 60s and 70s, reporting on violence as if it were caused by the protestors, which wasn't true then and I'm pretty sure it isn't true now. </p>
<p>And they describe them as Palestinians, when that also is certainly not what's really going on. My guess is that 99% of them are American students, who, growing up were taught that America had great values, only to discover that America often has taken the wrong side in a war, as we are now in the war between Hamas and Israel. </p>
<p>We shouldn't have taken a side in that war, as long as Israel insists on killing massive numbers of civilians in Gaza. Yes, what Hamas did was unsupportable, and provocative, and just plain wrong, but Israel is killing far more people than Hamas did, and further, it's exactly what Israel, which pretends to represent Holocaust survivors, should <i>not</i> be doing, perpetrating a new Holocaust. </p>
<p>As Americans we have a responsibility to think for ourselves, and that's why I support the students. They aren't right or wrong, but they are continuing the legacy of free speech in the US, and our government and journalists are lining up against them, which to me is as tragic in the 2020s as it was in the 1970s.</p>

<p>On our way home from our regular beach walk, Gizmo saw a cat! Actually he didn&rsquo;t see her at first, and was just like, &ldquo;wtf humans, why did you stop?&rdquo; But then the cat meowed, and Gizmo very sweetly put his paws on the brick wall and looked up in hope 😆 The cat didn&rsquo;t actually jump down to become his friend, but she didn&rsquo;t run away either – that&rsquo;s something!</p>

## Why is my ElasticSearch query so slow?

date: 2024-05-05, from: Matthew Lincoln Blog

<p>The center of my working hours for the past two years has been <a href="https://constellate.org">constellate.org</a>, a platform for teaching, learning, and performing text analysis with scholarly and primary source content from JSTOR, Portico, and elsewhere.</p>

<!--figure tags without plugin: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19331362/using-an-image-caption-in-markdown-jekyll -->

<figure>
	<img src="/assets/images-display/constellate-builder.png" alt="The Constellate [dataset builder page](https://constellate.org/builder)." />
	<figcaption>
		<p>The Constellate <a href="https://constellate.org/builder">dataset builder page</a>.</p>

	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Our dataset builder allows users to filter and explore a corpus of over 35 million documents.
This search - and the analytical queries that power the data visualizations in this builder - rely on an ElasticSearch cluster on the backend.
We rely heavily on ElasticSearch aggregations every time a user updates their filters, taking the resulting set of documents (no matter if it is 500 docs or 15 million) and count up the different document types, providers, genres, decades of publication, and more.
These aggregations are memory-heavy actions, especially when aggregating over 10+ million documents.
Even so, ElasticSearch was usually able to return results in under 3,000 milliseconds, providing an acceptable user experience.</p>

<h2 id="why-have-our-queries-gotten-slower-and-slower">Why have our queries gotten slower and slower?</h2>

<p>But we started to see something concerning happening: over the past six months, we watched the worst-case query durations (those the 95th percentile execution time for all searches performed in a week) steadily growing, starting to crest over an unbearable 10 seconds long.
At that point our default request timeouts on our backend services were truly breaking the end user experience.</p>

<!--figure tags without plugin: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19331362/using-an-image-caption-in-markdown-jekyll -->

<figure>
	<img src="/assets/images-display/constellate-durations.png" alt="Median and 95th percentile durations (in milliseconds) of search queries on [constellate.org](https://constellate.org)" />
	<figcaption>
		<p>Median and 95th percentile durations (in milliseconds) of search queries on <a href="https://constellate.org">constellate.org</a></p>

	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I hadn’t made any changes to the way we composed the queries we sent to ElasticSearch in that time.
Our overall usage was increasing, yes, and during very large bulk ingests we did see some overall slowdowns in query processing as expected.
But not at a pace that seemed liable to explain why these pathological query times were growing steadily worse.
We had been steadily adding new documents to the index, some coming in large monthly batches, but we’d been doing that for years without seeing this kind of progressive slowdown.</p>

<p>So I started experimenting, running searches directly against our cluster and one at a time, removing and adding back in the aggregations to see if any oe was causing a particularly heavy load on the cluster.
The culprit: our aggregation of keyphrases, which were sets of significant terms calculated for each document.
For very large search result sets that returned 20 or 30 million documents, the keyphrases <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/search-aggregations-bucket-terms-aggregation.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">terms</code></a> aggregation was adding between 3 and 8 ruinous whole seconds onto the query.</p>

<p>Why was this <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">terms</code> aggregation so slow, while the half-dozen others we were running were fast as ever?
Cardinality.
While we only have a handful of different providers, a few dozen subject categorizations, and maybe a hundred different languages, there are over <strong>50 million distinct keyphrases</strong> in the system.
With such high cardinality, ElasticSearch had to generate an extremely large set of global ordinals when being asked for a terms query, and then actually rank those ordinals and return the top fifty most frequently occurring.
Even <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/eager-global-ordinals.html#_avoiding_global_ordinal_loading">precalculating global ordinals</a> (the usual first step in addressing slow <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">terms</code> aggregations) was not enough to tame the IO needed to aggregate 30+ million documents’ intersection with 50+ million keyphrase values.</p>

<p>Why hadn’t this problem asserted itself before?
Because for a few years, we had only extracted keyphrases from about 1/3 of our documents, and weren’t actively contributing new ones into the system.
While better automating our ingest pipelines this year, we took the opportunity to regenerate a lot of our keyphrases, backfilling our database with an enormous number of new keyphrase values.
While this problem of cardinality was in our system all along, the scale simply wasn’t large enough to make its impact felt until recently.</p>

<h2 id="so-make-the-problem-smaller">So make the problem smaller</h2>

<p>Because we only want to get a relative ranking of the top keyphrases, a straightforward way to reduce this problem is to use a <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/search-aggregations-bucket-sampler-aggregation.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sampler</code></a> aggregation.
By grabbing a sample of up to 5,000 documents before running the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">terms</code> aggregation, we easily brought the impact of the keyphrases aggregation back under control.
This effectively puts a ceiling on the number of files whose keyphrases need to be looked up in an aggregation, and mitigates the real scaling issues that we were starting to encounter with our data.</p>

## Vibe Check №32

date: 2024-05-05, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>An unseasonable gloomy spring in Austin, TX. The kids are nearly done with school for the year and summer plans are shoring up. My son goes to middle school next year. Unbelievable.</p>
<p>We’ve battled some on-and-off sicknesses these past couple months and with all the holidays every week has felt like a false start. But here we are, barreling into summer. I’ve already been out on the lake to surf on my cousin’s boat, so I’ve got that going for me.</p>
<h2>The Eclipse</h2>
<p>In April my wife’s entire family came out from Arizona to Austin for the eclipse on April 8th. We got a big Vrbo near the lake right in the path of totality. The weather was cloudy and dismal in Austin for the eclipse. But then… ten minutes before full totality, the sky broke open.</p>
<p>I’ve seen partial eclipses before and those were cool. But nothing prepared me for seeing the total eclipse. The complete darkness. The confused birds. The sudden drop in temperature. The fully visible halo effect eminating from the sun. It’s other worldly to see the big space rock that goes around our planet move in front of the big fireball that keeps our planet alive.</p>
<p>Happy to get to celebrate something so cosmic with the family.</p>
<h2>44 and there’s so much more</h2>
<p>I turned 44 at the end of April and had an uneventful birthday. That’s how birthdays go after the big four-oh. I spent most of my day cleaning the house and watching anime. My family treated me to a “fancy dinner” at a place with cloth napkins and the kids behaved themselves through the whole meal.</p>
<p>The highlight of my birthday was exchanging texts with some old friends who have known me for decades. Old friends like that – even though you often live distant parallel busy lives – have the ability to tap into a deep well of friendship. For that I am thankful.</p>
<h2>Making Games</h2>
<p>I haven’t talked about it much, because I don’t want to jinx it, but I’ve been making some games in my spare time. And not one style of game either, a big swath of random ideas in different formats.</p>
<ul>
<li>A “Guess Who?”-style game for Panic’s <a href="https://play.date/">Playdate</a>.</li>
<li>A one-page TTRPG. Almost everything is in place for this.</li>
<li>A 52-card deck game that I’m turning into a game for your mobile computer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Making games has been a fun and different way to spend my time. I don’t have much to show for all that tinkering right this minute, but soon maybe?</p>
<h2>Waiting for a life-changing email</h2>
<p>You know that feeling when your boss emails you and asks “Hey, you got a minute?” and those minutes until you talk to your boss feels like hours as your amygdala floods your limbic system with intense, wet, hot anxiety? That’s more or less what I’ve been feeling for the last two months as I waited for a life-changing email. There were two emails actually. Then that got stressful. Then I had to wait on a package.</p>
<p>To be totally honest, all that waiting nearly broke me. I’m a decently patient person but a giant cloud LOOMING over me every day that I’m unable to control is distressing. Then your friends and family and kids ask you “Hey did that life-changing email come yet?” and you have to say “Nope, not yet” over and over.</p>
<p>But the email did come. And so did the package. And the giant cloud of concern is slowly dissipating. And on Monday I’ll embark on the next big phase of my adult life. Ominous, I know.</p>
<h2>Stats and consumption</h2>
<p>What you jackals come here for…</p>
<h3>🧠 <strong>Learning</strong></h3>
<p>I took some time to do some deep dives both formally and informally.</p>
<ul>
<li>TypeScript - Almost certain I’ll be using this sometime in the future, so I took a <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/">FrontendMasters</a> course to connect all the pieces I had scattered about in my brain.</li>
<li>LLM Vector Embeddings - All this LLM search jazz is normal vector search but with special GPT-based embeddings instead of Postgres’s default embeddings. Way less threatening or opaque to me now that I understand it.</li>
<li>Solo RPGs - I got a bit obsessed with the idea of playing a TTRPG by yourself and it inspired me to make a game.</li>
</ul>
<h3>💪 Wellness</h3>
<p>I’ve put on a bit of weight and that’s frustrating but I think again it’s stress-related.</p>
<ul>
<li>Taking walks</li>
<li>Got a weighted vest for “rucking”</li>
<li>Rode my new bike once</li>
</ul>
<h2>📖 <strong>Reading</strong></h2>
<p>Reading is still on a book-a-week clip. This year I’m mulling around tech and ethics, as well as reading about people who created or harnessed a new technology. I also got back into comics and have read some wonderful pieces. If it’s sci-fi themed and has good art, I’m all-in.</p>
<p><strong>Finished</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/43cI1vi">Doom Guy: Life in First Person</a> by John Romero - An autobiography about the man who created DOOM.</li>

<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3PxcKOf">Excellent Advice for Living</a> by Kevin Kelly - I’m a sucker for the “old man shares one-liner quips for living life better” genre. I’m also a big Kevin Kelly fan.</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3PJ2fr4">The Shame Machine</a> by Cathy O’Neil - The follow up to Weapons of Math Destruction is an illuminating book about the negative impact social media has on our lives.</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/4aV6Hex">The Coming Wave</a> by Mustafa Suleyman - The new CEO of AI at Microsoft, Mustafa Suleyman, has a history with AI and his work at Google’s Deep Mind which produced the AlphaGo AI. I thought this was going to be all “rah-rah” hypefest about AI, but instead I found it a pretty sober critique with a major theme around “containment” of this new technology.</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3UhrHGN">The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams</a> by Douglas Adams - I as happy to finally read this classic piece of sci-fi. Suprisingly relevant to now… down to the whole idea that politicians like Zaphod Beeblebrox win their office by creating outrage.</li>

</ul>
<h3>📝 <strong>Blogging</strong></h3>
<p>Slowed down a lot on blogging. That’s okay. I still have three dozen drafts but I’m being pretty choosy about where I toil. It’s easy for me to lose a weekend tinkering on a handful of posts, or piecing together a giant overly complex post like this. I need to stop doing that. Or I need to do that more often. Who knows.</p>

## Using DuckDB to seamlessly query a large parquet file over HTTP

date: 2024-05-05, from: Marginallia log

A neat property of the parquet file format is that it&rsquo;s designed with block I/O in mind, so that when you are interested in only parts of the contents of a file, it&rsquo;s possible to some extent to only read that data. Many tools are aware of this property, and DuckDB is one of them. Depending on which circles you run in, a lesser known aspect of HTTP is range requests, where you specify which bytes in a file to be retrieved.
