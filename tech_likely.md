## At last, browser choice*

date: 2024-01-29, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24050478/apple-ios-17-4-browser-engines-eu">EU Digital Markets Act is making waves in the Apple ecosystem</a>. For the first time ever you’ll be able to install a browser other than Safari/Webkit on iOS (as long as you live in the EU). While there are other browsers on the iOS App Store, they’re all Safari/Webkit under the hood due to non-competitive App Store submission guidelines.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://open-web-advocacy.org/">Open Web Advocacy</a> group have spent years documenting the issues at hand. I haven’t participated much there, but I’ve built countless web apps and have felt most (if not all) the pain points that come with supporting Safari users and, as a Mobile Safari user, not having access to features I’ve built. That feature gap has closed considerably in the last couple years and the Safari/Webkit team’s movement is impressive, their relative openness on issues is welcome, and <a href="https://webkit.org/standards-positions/">declaring standards positions</a> reduces risk and removes mystery. But this (potentially) blows the doors open on competition.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see what happens from here. Will we break out of the Chromium/Webkit duopoly? Or will we fall headlong into a Chromium monopoly? Regardless, the EU ruling is a win for the Open Web because now users have options beyond the OS-provided default browser. Before there was nothing beyond a thin veneer of choice.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, there are <a href="https://cloudfour.com/thinks/this-web-page-is-best-viewed-in-the-eu/">some questions on how to test this</a> if you don’t live in the EU and it’s not yet known if (or ever) the rest of the world might also get access to other browsers. And there seems to be some malicious compliance afoot… but hopefully over time the situation normalizes towards the ideal outcome; an unfettered web.</p>
<p>Next, if the EU could fix the GDPR banners that are killing the web, that would be wonderful.</p>

## An inbox full o’ opportunities

date: 2024-01-29, from: Dave Rupert blog

<browser-window shadow grayscale>
<div class="post-content">
<p>Hi Dave Rupert LLC,</p>
<p>I liked your latest blog post <a href="https://daverupert.com/2023/08/quick-thoughts-on-chips/">Quick toughts on chips</a> and see you are a business leader in accessibility, Doritos®, and Jekyll blogging software. I thought we should connect. I would like to inform you of an exciting opportunity.</p>
<p>I scraped or stole your email address from some list that you never signed up for, but would you like help growing your company’s sales? I can do the same impersonal, unsolicited, scumbag sales shit I’m doing to you right now but on behalf of your company.</p>
<p>I generated this with AI, so it took me literally no time or effort but I sent it anyways. The federal crime I just committed is utterly offensive and every time I send this to you under a different fake business name you instantly delete it, but some might also call it “innovative”. I can provide this service for your company. Reach new customers today by deploying large scale AI-driven spam operations.</p>
<p>I clearly have no ethics, but you should enter a business relationship with me, a guy who found your email on the internet.</p>
<p>You are now signed up for a no-opt-out email drip campaign to send you automated replies every day for the next week to get you to reply. Reply and start a conversation with your harasser if you’d like it to stop.</p>
<p>Also, would you like to have my boss on your podcast? He’s a B2B Growth Saas Fortune Trope 500 Under 500 Startups Entreprenuer and has a red Porsche. There’s almost no trace of this guy on the internet but you should absolutely have him on your super niche web development podcast. I think he’d be a great fit for your audience.</p>
<p>What do you say? Are you ready to increase the size of your revenue?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Helen</p>

                <p>Medical recordkeeping was originally a way to chart a patient’s course of illness and support clinicians in finding the best course. Now, electronic health records have disrupted the foundation of the therapeutic relationship. What happened?</p>

## Disinformation often gets blamed for swaying elections, but the research isn’t so clear

date: 2024-01-29, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

Many countries face general elections this year. Political campaigning will include misleading and even false information. Just days ago, it was reported that a robocall impersonating U.S. president Joe Biden had told recipients not to vote in the presidential primary. But can disinformation significantly influence voting? There are two typical styles of election campaigning. One...

## Berlin School

date: 2024-01-29, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1>Berlin School</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;m listening to <a href="https://yt.cdaut.de/watch?v=BE8rMsM3zLs">Berlin Schoool: An Uncomplicated Approach</a> by Synth Seeker because <a class="account" href="https://social.sdf.org/@phf" title="@phf@social.sdf.org">@phf</a> recommended it.</p>

<p>We were talking about music. All I do is create small jingles for my podcast but every now and then I wonder about music theory.
A while ago I had saved <a href="https://yewtu.be/watch?v=rgaTLrZGlk0">Learn music theory in half an hour</a> by Andrew Huang to get back to it.
But all I had done about it was think to myself: Pick a scale, like this one, B Major looks nice, OK, so full full half full full full half, that’s these keys, OK, let me doodle around on these … beep beep boop boop … here we go. Or maybe do the other one, full full full half full full half … biep biep boup boup … all right! 🥳</p>

<p>But then I wonder: what would my next step be? Some days I look at the circle of fifth and wonder if that’s hogwash. Non-European music doesn&rsquo;t need it! But then again, they also use <em>something</em>. There are rules because people figured out what generally &ldquo;works&rdquo;. Well, on the other hand there are books about many things and they are neither a replacement for spending ten thousand hours practising and the rules they espouse are often just there to get you started and then they are immediately broken.</p>

<p>All I know when I look at a typical drum machine or tracker setup with <sup>8</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> or similar I immediately want to do a <a href="https://babayagamusic.com/Music/nine-eight-rhythms.htm"><sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> Karsilama</a> or something like that. My wife&rsquo;s oriental dancing and all the Turkish, Arab, Iranian and Maghreb music we listened to must have left an impression… Or confused the hell out of me, depending on your perspective. Or mine.</p>

<p>Anyway, writing all of this and I&rsquo;m still not making music. What next, I wonder. Perhaps playing C Major and playing a bunch of notes it shares with another scale and then continuing with that scale is cool. Or maybe not. I don&rsquo;t know. Or just stay in that scale and do some drum machine and patterns below that!</p>

<p>That Synth Seeker video had a link to a <a href="https://www.hooktheory.com/cheat-sheet">Key Cheat Sheet Index</a>. The effect is similar to picking scales in Garage Band or Animoog: limiting the keys I use in order to stay in that scale. Works for me!</p>

<p>All this listening and writing makes me realize that it&rsquo;s Sunday, late at night, I should go to bed, and then I&rsquo;ll be working and playing role-playing games and war-games every evening until the next week-end comes around. Whaaat!</p>

<p>I must find time between the things I do to do the other things.</p>

<p>This is my life.</p>

<p><div class="divInlineImage"><center><img class="imgInline" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/01/29/daveAndDaveOnPotreroHill.png"></center>The Daves (Jacobs and Winer) at a Potrero Hill restaurant in the 90s.</div></p>
<p>We had already been friends for a few years then. By total coincidence we were both offered writing gigs at the then-new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_(magazine)#History">Wired</a>, Dave as the Fetish columnist, where he wrote about all the latest tech gadgetry, which was a perfect assignment for him, because Dave is one of the most tech-literate people you'll ever meet. Also an avid bike rider, Deadhead, and later a receiver of donated kidneys, and a pioneer of the technology for matching kidney donors with recipients. He has saved a lot of lives with his software. And he's still with us, against all odds. </p>
<p>Just chatted with him last night during the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/39413785/niners-beat-lions-nfc-championship-game-reach-super-bowl">Niners game</a>. The only football team I've ever loved, from back in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Montana">Joe Montana</a> days. </p>
<p>I was offered a column to basically write whatever I wanted to write about, although by default I was supposed to write about the world wide web, which was then as new as ChatGPT is today and every bit as exciting. You can find our respective columns somewhere I hope on the web. </p>

## VASL Templates

date: 2024-01-29, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1>VASL Templates</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;m trying to get <a href="https://vasl-templates.org/">VASL Templates</a> to run on my laptop so that I can create nice setups for Advanced Squad Leader. As it turns out, I have to use <code>pipx</code> because that automatically creates virtual environments for me, as far as I understand.</p>

<pre><code>cd src
git clone https://code.pacman-ghost.com/public/vasl-templates.git
cd vasl-templates
pipx install .
</code></pre>

<p>As it turns out, this is not enough:</p>

<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;/home/alex/.local/bin/vasl-templates&quot;, line 5, in &lt;module&gt;
    from vasl_templates.main import main
  File &quot;/home/alex/.local/pipx/venvs/vasl-templates/lib/python3.11/site-packages/vasl_templates/main.py&quot;, line 19, in &lt;module&gt;
    import PyQt5.QtWebEngineWidgets
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'PyQt5'
</code></pre>

<p>So now you need to install PyQt5 into the virtual environment used by vasl-templates:</p>

<pre><code>pipx inject vasl-templates PyQt5
</code></pre>

<p>Next error:</p>

<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;/home/alex/.local/bin/vasl-templates&quot;, line 5, in &lt;module&gt;
    from vasl_templates.main import main
  File &quot;/home/alex/.local/pipx/venvs/vasl-templates/lib/python3.11/site-packages/vasl_templates/main.py&quot;, line 19, in &lt;module&gt;
    import PyQt5.QtWebEngineWidgets
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'PyQt5.QtWebEngineWidgets'
</code></pre>

<p>Fix:</p>

<pre><code>pipx inject vasl-templates PyQtWebEngine
</code></pre>

<p>And now it works at last! 😅</p>

After many years of playing with YAML in k8s, I&rsquo;ve returned to using CFEngine (at work). The last config management software before that was Puppet. An issue I see with all modern config management tooling is the lack of monitoring and the impossibility to cleanly roll back. In k8s it works better, but that&rsquo;s only for pods running in k8s (which are stateless), not the underlying machines.

You have a hobby you&rsquo;ve been into for a decade or more. You like talking about your hobby, and your friends and family, after listening to these things for as long as you&rsquo;ve been into them, maybe aren&rsquo;t as excited to always hear about it as you are about discussing them, so in an act of compassion you create a youtube channel where you can monologue about your passion instead.

## pgEdge Redefines Distributed PostgreSQL with the Launch of pgEdge Cloud Developer Edition

date: 2024-01-29, from: PostgreSQL News

<p>First serverless distributed Postgres managed cloud service delivers low latency and high availability in three minutes or less</p>
<p>Alexandria, Virginia – January 24, 2024 — pgEdge, Inc., the leading company dedicated to distributed Postgres, today announced the launch of pgEdge Cloud Developer Edition, making it easy for developers to deploy and access distributed Postgres databases for low latency and high availability. pgEdge Cloud is the first fully distributed database as a service (DBaaS) optimized for the network edge and based completely on the widely adopted open-source PostgreSQL database. pgEdge Cloud Developer is a generous free tier for developers to rapidly and easily experience the advantages of distributed Postgres.</p>
<p>pgEdge Cloud addresses the growing demand for low-latency and “always on” applications that need to be dispersed across multiple cloud regions. As a fully managed distributed Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS), pgEdge Cloud empowers developers and database architects with an intuitive user interface for creation, management and monitoring of distributed database clusters running across multiple cloud regions.</p>
<p>By putting database nodes closer to global users, pgEdge Cloud can dramatically reduce latency and application response times, particularly page loads for database intensive applications. Additionally, having multiple replicated database nodes across the network ensures high levels of availability, since when a node fails or is not reachable traffic automatically routes to the nearest still available node.</p>
<p>pgEdge Cloud is especially well suited for use with edge development platforms such as Cloudflare Workers, Vercel and Fastly. The ability to place database nodes in multiple regions around the global network, together with automated and seamless nearest-node routing, allow developers to deploy very low latency applications that eliminate slow round trips to a single centrally located database. pgEdge Cloud Developer Edition includes built-in integration for Cloudflare Workers, and support for Vercel and Fastly will be available in coming weeks. An example demonstrating pgEdge Cloud’s ease of integration with Cloudflare is https://github.com/pgEdge/cloudflare-worker-template. Additionally, a demo application running against a distributed version of the well-known “Northwind Traders” database, and implemented with Cloudflare Workers and pgEdge Cloud, is at: https://northwind.pgedge.com/.</p>
<p>Key features of pgEdge Cloud Developer Edition include:</p>
<p>Instant Deployment: Developers can now deploy a globally distributed PostgreSQL serverless database in just a minute, streamlining the database setup process and accelerating development.</p>
<p>Predefined multi-region clusters: Creation and deployment of pgEdge distributed databases is simplified via prebuilt global clusters. Developers can select from a set of predefined multi-region clusters that span the continental US, US and Europe, or US, Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>Multi-Master (Active-Active) Architecture: Each database node can handle both read and write traffic for low latency and high availability, utilizing an eventually consistent multi-master architecture with built in conflict resolution and reporting.</p>
<p>Latency-based DNS Routing: Geo-proximity routing ensures that users are connected to the nearest pgEdge node that is up and running. </p>
<p>Generous Free Tier: Available for prototyping, application development and evaluation of pgEdge capabilities with up to 12GB of storage across three nodes. </p>
<p>Management and Monitoring: Eliminates the need for manual infrastructure configuration and management while providing automated backups, security against misconfiguration, and continuous monitoring via a clean and easy to use web dashboard.</p>
<p>"pgEdge Cloud Developer Edition marks a significant leap in our mission to make it easy for developers to build and deploy highly distributed database applications across the global network," said Phillip Merrick, Co-founder and CEO at pgEdge. "The innovative features of the pgEdge Cloud fully managed service, from multi-region, multi-master support to its intuitive user interface, empower developers to easily create and manage distributed PostgreSQL databases."</p>
<p>Availability</p>
<p>pgEdge Cloud Developer Edition is available today in preview.  Users requiring more resources or capabilities beyond what is offered in the Developer Edition free tier can upgrade to either pgEdge Cloud Team Edition (coming in H1 2024), or pgEdge Cloud Enterprise Edition.</p>
<p>Experience pgEdge Cloud Developer Edition by signing up at www.pgedge.com/get-started/cloud.  To learn more visit www.pgedge.com or join us for an exclusive webinar “Getting to the Low Latency, High Availability Goodness of Distributed Postgres in 3 Minutes or Less” on Wednesday January 31st at 1pm ET https://hubs.la/Q02gBnsh0.  The first 500 users to sign up for pgEdge Cloud Developer Edition will be eligible for an exclusive launch t-shirt. (Restrictions apply. Offer available in US only.)</p>

## Resizing macOS app windows for 16:9 screen capture

date: 2024-01-28, from: Jeff Geerling blog

<span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Resizing macOS app windows for 16:9 screen capture</span>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>I frequently need to capture a window of some Mac app for a recording (usually for my YouTube channel), and I've used a little AppleScript I wrote years ago for the purpose.</p>

<p>Somehow, that script (which I saved as a 'one shot' App (<code>.app</code> extension) that just runs then quits) got deleted off my Script Editor folder in my iCloud Drive, so I had to re-create it.</p>

<p>Luckily, the syntax for this operation is dead simple:</p>

<pre><code>tell application "Safari"
    set bounds of front window to {0, 50, 1280, 770}
end tell
</code></pre>

<p>You can adjust the <code>{X, Y, width, height}</code> parameters accordingly—note that the width and height seem to be additive to the X/Y. So I use 770 instead of 720 for the height (720 + 50).</p>

<p>In <code>Script Editor</code>, save the file as a <code>.app</code>, with the option to keep it running unchecked. Now, whenever you want a window sized perfectly for capture, just press Command + Spacebar, then type in the name of the Script/App you saved, and hit enter. The top-most window in Safari will scale to exactly 720p resolution.</p></div>

## Morning ChatGPT Notes

date: 2024-01-28, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2017/09/04/peterRojas.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I spent a couple of days putting together a JSON text editor in a modal dialog for a project I'm working on. I'm combining the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/aceEditorDemo">Ace editor</a> with the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap toolkit</a>. I've used both components before, but never together. And they're always a bit tricky to get working because I'm impatient and the docs are spread out, and there are different versions. It's all kind of a mess, so you just get it working and move on, never quite sure why it works, and I rarely end up with reusable code. But it's certainly a lot better than starting from scratch, which basically is impossible, given the depth of the two components. After spinning my wheels a bit, I did what I always do in 2024, I turned to ChatGPT, outlined the problem, and asked if it knew of any sample code, which it proceeded to write for me, in about two seconds (not kidding about that). I copied their code and pasted it into my editor and ran it. It worked. Then I went through a number of iterations, restructuring the code to meet my needs, each time checking with ChatGPT, asking what it thought of my code. And of course there were problems, for example at one point there were two vertical scrollbars, and each time we worked <i>together</i> to figure out the problem and the fix. In the end, I have a solid editor that works exactly as I want it to, and best of all, I understand how it works. Here's the <a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/840e8159-9988-4159-8289-5167d6fb78c8">transcript of the work</a> I did with it, over more than 24 hours, a few different sessions. </p>
<p>I'll try to remember when this code ships as part of a product, to link to this perspective.</p>
<p>Next up, I'd like to get it to understand my coding conventions, so when it shares code with me it can save me the step of having to convert its conventions to mine. In other words, I'd like to return the favor. It's doing a great job of teaching and coaching me. I'd like to teach it how to do that better, so we work better together over time. And perhaps it can teach human programmers what I've learned about programming in over 50 years of doing this work. </p>
<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2017/09/05/enjoyEveryDay.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">A bit of philosophy. People say these things aren't intelligent, but seriously, if I can engage with it as if it were intelligent, far more intelligent in ways than I am, what's the difference between that and actually being intelligent? I know from a lifetime of dealing with supposedly intelligent humans, and being one myself, how rarely we focus on the idea that the person we're conversing with has an inner life that's vastly different from ours and no less complex, and contradictory. We tend to think of others as being like us, or like someone who raised us. Always in a movie, never in the moment. So why is it interesting that ChatGPT is a machine? These are questions thinkers and writers have been pondering for decades if not centuries, but -- <i>now we're living it.</i> I'm so happy to have made it this far! An amazing experience, so much learning in so little time. I don't understand how people can sit on the sidelines and not want to be the first to try all this stuff out, to be part of its evolution. I feel so lucky. </p>
<p>A puzzling thing, in the transcripts I'm identified as "anonymous," but I am logged in. It must know my name. I bet this is some kind of setting which defaults to anonymous, to play it safe. </p>
<p>One more thing. I copied and pasted the text above into ChatGPT. <a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/5fe361cd-1fca-4e8d-82cc-920514e8c4b8">Here are its comments</a>. A funny thing about ChatGPT is that you can't ask it how to use ChatGPT itself. It doesn't know about the chat UI? </p>
<p>Yet another thing. I remember my father, when he was forced to retire by illness, said how fortunate he was that the internet was there, so he could be involved in the world even though he had stopped working. He said his father would have loved it, and I don't doubt that he would. Same with ChatGPT. My parents and uncles were always looking up stuff, wanting to understand how things worked. This is a whole new level. The machines are now far better at collaborating over the net than humans are. Where will that take us? Maybe this is something else we can learn from the machines. </p>

## Drivethru, I am unhappy!

date: 2024-01-28, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1>Drivethru, I am unhappy!</h1>

<p>The DrivethruRPG website so depends on shit that it loads from other domains that I cannot log in no matter how many exceptions I add to uBlock Origin, Privacy Badger, or the Firefox content blocking preferences. And with every second I spend doing this, I resent them more. And when I finally start Chromium to try and connect, I&rsquo;m already ranting as I sit at my laptop. And then I get Connection timed out from cloudflare and really… I feel like they don&rsquo;t want my money. Uuuugh.</p>

<p>I used their contact form. When I hit the submit button I was greeted by a white page. I don&rsquo;t know if they go an email. (I did try the next day from a phone and that worked – which sort of illustrates the point.)</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what I wrote:</p>

<p>I think in a world where big tech is tracking us, where everybody and their uncle is spying on us, it is only natural that people start locking down their browser. I have uBlock Origin and Privacy Badger installed and I tell all my browsers to do as much content blocking as they can, I delete all cookies when I close the browser. It&rsquo;s the right thing to do. It is all the more galling when a website such as Drivethru becomes practically unusable as a consequence of me trying to do the right thing. It feels as if Drivethru is betraying me to the big tech corporations, helping them spy on me. It&rsquo;s a revolting feeling. These days, I have it every time I remember to use an unprotected Chromium browser just to log into Drivethru. Every single time I wish for an alternative. Every single time I hope that itch.io and other competitors end up replacing you.</p>

I don&rsquo;t really expect an answer to this email. It just feels unfair to rant on social media about the situation without telling you about it.</p>

## Tiny11 creates a 100MB version of Windows 11 by axing the windows

date: 2024-01-28, from: OS News

If you know your Windows history, you&#8217;ll know that the operating system got that name when it moved away from using pure MS-DOS and started using a graphical user interface to show things. As it turns out, you can force Windows 11 back to its legacy roots and reduce it back to a command-line interface. This is what the developer of Tiny11 has achieved, calling their new creation &#8220;Minwin.&#8221; The developer of Win11, NTDev, posted a video on YouTube about their project. There&#8217;s absolutely nothing flashy here; no Copilot, no Start menu, and definitely no UI. It&#8217;s as graphically complex as the Command Prompt, which meant that NTDev had to resort to fancy 00s-era ASCII logos to announce that Minwin was working. ↫ Simon Batt at XDA Definitely a neat proof-of-concept, and it shows just how modular Windows could be if only Microsoft allowed its users to take out the parts they don&#8217;t need. I wonder how close this is to Nano Server, an installation option for Windows Server you&#8217;ve probably never heard of. I also like the nod to MinWin, the informal codename Microsoft used internally to refer to an effort by a small number of expert Windows kernel engineers to untangle the spaghetti ball of dependencies that had sprouted between the various architectural layers of Windows. This project started around Vista, and eventually made it possible to make broader, sweeping changes to Windows without breaking things all over the place because the spaghetti ball of internal, low-level dependencies wasn&#8217;t mapped out.

## Two months in Servo: better inline layout, stable Rust, and more

date: 2024-01-28, from: OS News

Another month, another pile of improvement to Servo, the rendering engine written in Rust, originally a Mozilla project. This month the proof-of-concept browser UI got forward and backward buttons, making this bare-bones UI just a tiny bit more usable. Of course, the vast majority of changes and improvements are all focused on the actual rendering engine, which makes sense because Servo definitely isn&#8217;t ready for any prime time use &#8211; nor is anyone claiming it is. I&#8217;m incredibly curious to see where Servo goes in the future.
