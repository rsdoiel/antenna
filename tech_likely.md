## Former Student Launch Competitor Turns Experience into NASA Engineering Career

date: 2024-02-27, from: NASA breaking news

By Jessica Barnett Sometimes, all it takes is a few years and the right people to completely change a person’s career trajectory. One such example is Meredith Patterson, an aerospace engineer at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, who went from knowing little to nothing about rockets to being part of the team [&#8230;]

## Adding Full Post Content to my RSS Feed

date: 2024-02-27, from: Nora Tindall's blog

A reader reached out to me the other day to let me know that my RSS feed for this blog didn&rsquo;t include post content, just descriptions, and that this hindered their ability to read my posts offline. This obviously isn&rsquo;t ideal, so I set about adding the full post content.
Customizing the RSS Feed Hugo comes with a builtin RSS feed template, but it&rsquo;s easy enough to override. Simply copy the contents of this file to the themes/[theme name]/layouts/_default directory, and then edit to your heart&rsquo;s content.

## 2024-02-07 Apple killed music on the move, for me

date: 2024-02-27, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1>2024-02-07 Apple killed music on the move, for me</h1>

<p>I was thinking about joining the <a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/cool-tech-zone/tangara">Tangara</a> crowdfunding. It&rsquo;s a kind of iPod, but better in that it is all open. Yay!</p>

<p>But then I realized something: Having an iPhone made listening to music such a shit show that I basically stopped and switched my entire phone-based audio entertainment to podcasts. Because podcast clients are great (at least <a href="https://icatcher.app/about/">iCatcher</a> is) where as Apple Music is a pain. Having used iTunes when it was cool until it was unusable, and then realizing what a pain the weird AAC formats on the files were, and the DRM on some of them, preventing me from playing them on other machines I owned. I was so angry.</p>

<p>In a fit of hate I decided I was going to <a href="2019-07-08_Apple_Photos">move all my pictures out of iPhotos</a> and all my music out of iTunes and never go back. And I did. And so the Apple Music app died, and I guess no alternatives were allowed on the App Store because Apple is great like that, and so when the iPod classic I had with <a href="2017-12-21_Rockbox_on_the_iPod">Rockbox</a> installed <a href="2022-11-18_iPod%2C_iPad%2C_iPhone%2C_iPiss">finally died</a>, all I was left with was podcasts on the iPhone.</p>

<p>And so now I don&rsquo;t even know whether I want to listen to music any more while I&rsquo;m on the move.</p>

<p>Apple killed music on the move, for me.</p>

<p>At home it&rsquo;s a different story, of course, but Tangara is a portable music player.</p>

<p>I wish Tangara the best of luck.</p>

<p><strong>2024-02-27</strong>. I joined the Kickstarter. Not because I have a terribly good feeling about it but because I remember wanting a portable audio player and I recently found, once again, that I really hate the Apple Music app.</p>

## Microsoft wants to update your Windows 11 PC without forcing you to reboot

date: 2024-02-27, from: OS News

If there&#8217;s one thing Windows users hate about Windows, it&#8217;s Windows updates interrupting your workflow or gaming session with a popup asking you to restart your PC finish installing the latest security update. It happens at least once a month, because that&#8217;s how often Microsoft rolls out security updates to Windows PCs. This may soon be a thing of the past, as the company is now testing an update method called &#8220;hot patching&#8221; for Windows 11 PCs. Hot patching is already in use on some Windows Server editions, as well as Xbox, and now it appears the company is preparing to bring it to devices running Windows 11. ↫ Zac Bowden at Windows Central A welcome, good improvement every Windows user is going to benefit from. This is the kind of improvements Microsoft should really be focusing on, instead of adding more ads or useless &#8220;AI&#8221; features.

## A history of the tty

date: 2024-02-27, from: OS News

It&#8217;s one of those anachronisms that is deeply embedded in modern technology. From cloud operator servers to embedded controllers in appliances, there must be uncountable devices that think they are connected to a TTY. I will omit the many interesting details of the Linux terminal infrastructure here, as it could easily fill its own article. But most Linux users are at least peripherally aware that the kernel tends to identify both serial devices and terminals as TTYs, assigning them filesystem names in the form of /dev/tty*. Probably a lot of those people remember that this stands for teletype or perhaps teletypewriter, although in practice the term teleprinter is more common. ↫ J. B. Crawford I remember first using Linux in like 2000 or 2001, and running into the abbreviation tty, and not having a single clue what that meant since I came from a DOS and Windows background. Over time I gained a lot more understanding of the structure of modern UNIX-like systems, but it&#8217;s still great to read such a detailed history of the concept.

## Fast Poetry and pre-commit with GitHub Actions

date: 2024-02-27, from: Max Halford Blog

This is a short post to share a GitHub Actions pattern I use to setup Poetry and pre-commit. These two tools cover most of my Python development needs. I use Poetry to manage dependencies and pre-commit to run code checks and formatting. The setup is fast because it caches the virtual environment and the .local directory.
I like to use custom actions for this type of stuff. These are base actions that can be re-used in multiple workflows.

## Developers’ fireside chat – 2nd March

While the number of people using RISC OS is very small by the standards of other other operating systems, and by extension the number of programmers comparatively minuscule, within the community the number of people programming is &#8211; probably, at least &#8211; quite high as a proportion of users. One of the reasons for this is almost certainly the ease with which it is possible to start programming a RISC OS computer, with one very popular language supplied out of the box &#8211; BBC BASIC is included as part of&#8230;

## GUSTO Breaks NASA Scientific Balloon Record for Days in Flight

date: 2024-02-26, from: NASA breaking news

Fifty-five days, one hour, and 34 minutes was the NASA record to beat, and the GUSTO (Galactic/Extragalactic ULDB Spectroscopic Terahertz Observatory) scientific balloon mission did just that Saturday, Feb. 24, while flying high above the icy surface of Antarctica. GUSTO is now the new record-holder for longest flight of any NASA heavy-lift, long-duration scientific balloon [&#8230;]

And now they get to parade around in public with these obscene hats on. When will the swastikas start appearing on the hats. I wonder if this is the first of many.

## Scopetrex

date: 2024-02-25, from: Microcores blog



<p>Since I started hacking on computer hard- and software in the 1980s, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_6809" title="Motorola 6809">Motorola's
6809 processor</a> is one of my favorite 8-bit CPUs. The 6809 is the last generation of Motorola's 8-bit CPU family, which started with the 6800 in 1974 and also was used in a number of microcontrollers of the 6805, HC11 and 9S12 families. The latter are still used in automotive applications today. If you know the 6502, the 6809 feels quite familiar, since it has an identical bus interface and very similar assembler programming model without some of the constraints of the 6502 such as an 8-bit stack pointer or a lack of 16-bit address registers. This is not really surprising, since a number of Motorola 6800 engineers left the company to develop the 6502 and then joined MOS.</p>

<p>However, the 6809 only came to the market in 1978 - only a year before the 68000 - and thus was quite late (and also rather expensive compared to the 6502 and Z80). Only a few home computers used the processor, e.g. the Dragon 32 and 64, the Tandy Color Computer and Thompson's MO5 and TO7.</p>

<p>Another system which used the 6809 was a quite special game console, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vectrex" title="Vectrex">Vectrex</a>. Instead of a standard raster-based screen, the Vectrex used its CRT as a vector display by controlling the X and Y deflection as well as the intensity of the CRT's electron beam directly. This is done by generating analog voltages for the X and Y position using an 8-bit digital-to-analog converter (DAC0808). Since DACs were quite expensive back then, the single DAC analog output is multiplexed using a CD4052 analog multiplexer to the various connectors. The rest of the Vectrex hardware is rather simple. A 6522 VIA connects to the DAC and some control functions and a AY3-8912 chip generates sound and provides another 8-bit port to interface to the Vectrex controllers. The remaining chips are an 8 kB ROM, 1 kB of SRAM (32 kB in the Scopetrex), some 74-series glue logic and a number of op-amps and other analog chips to generate the analog signal outputs.</p>

<p>Vectrexes were only built for about two years and unfortunately have become highly sought after (read: expensive) collector's items. Luckily, since the Vectrex uses only standard components, it is rather simple to build a clone. The software situation is also quite nice, since Jay Smith, then head of Smith Engineering (the designer of the Vectrex), allowed new hard/software development on a fee- and royalty-free basis and has also allowed duplication of the original Vectrex software on a not-for-profit basis.</p>

<p>Such a Vectrex clone is available in form of the <a href="https://github.com/schlae/scopetrex" title="Scopetrex">Scopetrex by TubeTime</a>. This is not a 100% replica since it uses a different PCB form factor and a 32 kB SRAM instead of the original 1 kB, but is perfectly compatible with all original software. It's a good project to get started with a more complex hardware build if you have some soldering experience and most of the parts are still available new from vendors such as Digikey or Mouser. The 6809 CPU (you will need at least the 1.5 MHz version 68A09, a 68B09 will also work fine - both the versions with internal clock generator and the one without that has the "E" suffix can be used) and the sound chip (a AY3-8910 or YM2149 can also be used) can be easily found on aliexpress.</p>

<p>My Vectrex build worked out of the box, now I only need to find a suitable vector display. You can use an oscilloscope in X-Y mode, but most modern scopes no longer feature a Z (intensity) input, so the display is disturbed by vectors which should not be drawn (intensity = 0). If you have an old analog Hameg 203, this will work nicely... A picture of the successful bringup is shown below.</p>

<p>By concidence, <a href="https://itwww.hs-pforzheim.de/daten/mitarbeiter/johannsen/vectrex_lab/projects/scopetrex/scopetrex.htm" title="Scopetrexes">a colleague in Germany has also started building Scopetrexes</a>. Small world...</p>

## I have a new* website

date: 2024-02-25, from: Manu - I write blog

<p>Well, kinda. It’s not really new as you can see. The typeface is—probably—still the same, the layout is mostly the same but lots of things have changed. Let me go through them</p>
<h2>Typefaces</h2>
<p>This site is now—potentially—using web fonts. I’m saying potentially because if you’re reading this on a Mac or on something running iOS you’re probably seeing a system font. My old site was designed around the Iowan typeface but that’s only available on iOS and Mac so most people were seeing a different version using one of the other available serif typefaces. That choice was because I went through a phase where I was trying to push my site toward extreme minimalism. And if you ask me, I had quite the success in that regard. My site was just 1 single HTTP request, the CSS was stupidly optimized and everything was stupid fast and stupid lightweight. But the designer in me was bothered by this and I decided to bring back a web font. If you’re on Windows or Android you’re now getting served Iowan as a web font. I’m also now using a sans-serif font for a couple of small details. I have no idea what you’re seeing because I’m defaulting on a system font.</p>
<p>I also messed with the typography a little bit and changed a few things here and there but the site should still feel mostly the same. I’m not done fine-tuning all this and I’m sure I’ll keep changing little things here and there for months but I had enough and I decided to push it live.</p>
<h2>New “Where do you go from here?” section</h2>
<p>Back when I designed my site, that section between the content of the post and the archive was meant to be a place to store my contact info and not much else. But it ended up being a place to dump all sorts of stuff and there were just too many links and I didn’t want to add more to make things worse.</p>
<p>That’s why I decided to rethink that section entirely and it’s now a lot more organised but still quite minimal. All the old links are still there but now there’s direct access to two new things.</p>
<h2>Guestbook</h2>
<p>The first of those two new things is a <a href="/guestbook">guestbook</a>. I thought about making one months ago but back then I didn’t want to mess with my site. But now it’s here and I can’t wait to see what you people out there are going to write on it.</p>
<h2>Supporters</h2>
<p>The second is the <a href="/supporters">supporters</a> page. I don’t want kindness to go unnoticed and I plan to make that page a lot more useful and structured. I want to provide as much value as possible to those who are kind enough to support what I do and that’s going to be just one of the places where I plan to do it.</p>
<h2>Closing thoughts</h2>
<p>I’m quite happy with this subtle refresh. My site’s been the same for almost 7 years at this point but I still think it works quite well so I don’t want to completely redesign it. At least not yet. Maybe in another 7 years.</p>
<p>As always, <a href="mailto:hello@manuelmoreale.com">my inbox is always open</a> so if you want to share your thoughts you know what to do. And don’t forget to sign my guestbook!</p>

## Lisp in Small Processors

date: 2024-02-25, from: Microcores blog



<p>While AI is all the rage again, the previous AI wave was focusing on languages like Lisp and Prolog and even built hardware with special processors optimized to execute Lisp code, made by companies such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolics" title="Symbolics">Symbolics</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_Machines" title="Lisp Machines, Inc. (LMI)">Lisp Machines, Inc.</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments_Explorer" title="TI Explorer">Explorer Series by Texas Instruments</a>. The machines used OSes written in Lisp and provided the user with large, bitmapped screens to operate a mouse-based GUI and networking.</p>

<p>Lisp machines originated at <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu" title="MIT's AI Lab">MIT's AI Lab</a> and were influential for a number of reasons. A certain Richard Stallman was a graduate student at the AI Lab and unhappy with the commercialization of the Lisp technology by LMI and Symbolics, started to develop Free Software such as Emacs and the gcc compiler and started the Free Software Foundation. The LMI LAMBDA machine was based on Western Digital's NuBus bus system and was subsequently acquired by TI to create the Explorer. </p>

<p>The NuBus was, in turn, used by Motorola 68k-based Macintosh and early PowerPC systems as well as the NeXT Cube. These NuBus-based Macs were subsequently used to create personal Lisp workstations which employed a VLSI integrated Lisp chip and used the Mac as I/O system. Both Symbolics and TI offered such a system, MacIvory and MicroExplorer, respectively. The latest development is an emulator of Symbolics Lisp machines, the <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?GeneraOs" title="Genera OS">Genera OS</a>.</p>

<p><strong>If you own a MacIvory or MicroExplorer card you want to sell, please get in touch</strong></p>

<p>However, there were also efforts to implement Lisp on smaller machines, including popular 8-bit CPUs. The <a href="https://archive.org/details/BYTE_Vol_04-08_1979-08_Lisp" title="BYTE August 1979">August 1979 issue of BYTE magazine</a> was dedicated to Lisp and did not only provide a lot of background on the language and its application, but also published the implementation of a Lisp interpreter written by S. Tucker Taft in assembly for the Motorola 6800. Unfortunately, the space in that issue was constrained, so only a part of the interpreter source code was published and the complete code could be ordered from BYTE. 45 years later, this is no longer possible, so I thought the code was lost...</p>

<p>Thanks to the power of Mastodon, Pablo Marx (thanks a lot!) managed to find the original listing of that Lisp implementation and sent me <a href="files/BYTE_6800_LISP_Interpreter.pdf" title="Lisp source PDF">the scanned document as PDF</a> as well as <a href="https://github.com/pablomarx/lisp6800" title="Github 6800 Lisp repository">a link to his github repository with the 6800 Lisp code</a>.</p>

<p>If you are interested to know how a low-level implementation of a Lisp VM, including the REPL, lambdas, and a garbage collector works, I can recommend taking a look at this article and the accompanying source code. I'm thinking of porting the VM to my <a href="https://github.com/schlae/scopetrex" title="Scopetrex">Scopetrex Vectrex game console clone</a>. This is a fascinating piece of hardware based on Motorola's 6809 CPU, the successor of the 6800, which is not binary compatible. However, the <a href="https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/13975/how-did-the-6809-achieve-source-code-compatibility-with-the-6800" title="conversion">assembler source code can be easily converted</a>. The Vectrex and the Scopetrex clone use a vector CRT display, which makes developing software for the system quite interesting.</p>

<p>Automatic conversion of the assembly code should also be possible, e.g. there is a <a href="https://colorcomputerarchive.com/repo/Documents/Manuals/Programming/6502-6809Translator%20%28Computer%20Systems%20Consultants%29.pdf" title="6502 to 6809 converter">6502 to 6809 converter</a>.</p>

There's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJVWZy4QOy0">Beatles song</a>, by John Lennon, that was written by cribbing promotional items from a 19th-century <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Being_for_the_Benefit_of_Mr._Kite!#Background">circus poster</a>. It's kind of like asking ChatGPT to give you some random phrases and presenting that as your creativity. I think I'm going to <a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/4aafde35-2903-48e3-88c0-bcd8725ac702">try that now</a>. I asked ChatGPT to write a poem using ideas from a random song written by John Lennon. It chose Imagine. I asked that it write a poem using the ideas in Day Tripper. And finally I asked it to write a song based on the story of The Matrix.

However writing is one of my things. I've been writing every day for almost <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/">thirty years</a>. My writing style has changed a lot over the years. I don't necessarily think it's gotten better, it's just different. I would never post writing publicly written by a anyone other than me without saying it was. Writing for me is very personal. On the other hand, I don't draw very well, never have. I used to be good at box diagrams with arrows, but I'm really out of practice. So if you see something colorful here, that <i>was</i> drawn by a bot, unless it says otherwise. I think we all have to be very clear about that. Now, I do write a lot in ChatGPT because I'm trying to get it to help me solve problems, almost always technical. Basically you have to <a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/b4235922-c4e2-4996-89cf-48c34cf2af67">sketch</a> out the problem in English very specifically so it gives you back what you want. I never thought I'd be programming in English, but here I am doing it. I really want a copy of everything I write, because someday I might want to feed it into a bot other than ChatGPT. There's the lock-in. <i>They own part of me, and I don't even get a copy. </i>Yes yes I know I can download individual conversations, but not if they include an image btw, did you think of that? And who has time to remember to download them. This is fucked up. One of my action items is to hook <a href="http://drummer.land/">Drummer</a> up to their API so I'm not relying on their editor. Every time you find yourself typing into a <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/01/14/031201.html">tiny little text box</a> the alarms should go off.

## Marginalia: 3 Years

date: 2024-02-25, from: Marginallia log

It&rsquo;s been three years since the inception of Marginalia Search, then a dinky experiment to find where the heck the cool Internet has gone, now my full time job.
While there&rsquo;s always things that can be improved, it&rsquo;s fair to say the search engine has never worked as well as it does right now.
A great number of milestones have been reached, perhaps biggest of all the search engine has moved out of my living room and into a proper enterprise server.
