## 2024-03-07 Why do we even blog?

date: 2024-03-13, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-03-07-why-do-we-even-blog">2024-03-07 Why do we even blog?</h1>

<p>The urge to blog lives in a strange place. One speaks to an imagined audience. It
is not enough to imagine an audience, though. It&rsquo;s more than writing into a
booklet, &ldquo;Dear Diary, …&rdquo; – and yet we do it even if there are no comments.
Sure, I never had a lot of comments. But I think I&rsquo;m just as happy getting the
occasional email or reply on the fediverse. The thought of somebody reading the
words is terrifying. And once I got that first comment, once I started linking
the blog from my profiles, putting it out there for others to find, inviting people to read and
implicitly, to judge… I started discovered that the blog was something I feared.
The blog is a thrill. It makes me nervous. The heart beats. The heart bleeds.</p>

<p>Back when the blog had comments, I used to be anxious about comments. First, there&rsquo;s a
comment. Is it good or bad? Do I read it now? Do I risk a look? But then the
imagined audience is still there and now it&rsquo;s worse. How will I react as I am being watched?
Blogging turns into a performance where I feel like I&rsquo;m demonstrating my moral character. I am
not a racist! I am not a white supremacist! I am not a homophobe! Or am I? All
the discourse online has made me self-conscious. I really
don&rsquo;t want to be what I fear I might be without knowing it. I keep thinking of
the idea that people who aren&rsquo;t very observant being unable to perceive their
own faults. The requirements go up when I learn more.</p>

<p>The effect of all that anxiety, for me, is that I take things seriously. Words
are serious. I try to put my word where my heart is. I try to weight them
carefully. I weigh my heart. Writing is morally intense. It doesn&rsquo;t matter how
long or how short the page, how trivial or how controversial the topic.</p>

<p>And above all of it hangs the grey sky of unspoken words, of thoughts unexamined
and all that maladjustment, all the failures, all the judgements. How often have
I found myself falling short of my own measure.</p>

<p>To blog is to wrestle with that. I imagine an audience that is strangely
interested in all the things I am interested in. I write for them, for me, for
my future self that looks back, the heart full of regret. I struggle for virtue
and I put it into words for you and me, the imagined reader and myself. As proof.
&ldquo;I struggled!&rdquo; I struggle. I keep on struggling to discover what is right and
to do what is right.</p>

<p>Blogging is like writing secret confessions. I write about the things that I
think I did well because I did them wrong and then I changed my mind. I write
about the things I know because I did not know them before. And who cares about
those laborious system administration blog posts where I struggle with this or
that ephemeral problem. All these issues are lost pages. Nobody cares. People
find their answers on Stack Overflow or Reddit or some other centralized
platform where middlemen gamify the experience so that we can help each other
while on the thread-mill for their pockets. And who cares about those blog posts
about growing old or playing games? People read them and move on. Like I do,
when I&rsquo;m reading online. Even if I am moved, I will move on. And there are so
many posts to read, the folders on my disk with saved articles and snippets are
more like compost heaps, where layer upon layer of good stuff gets dropped,
never to see the light of day again.</p>

<p>Perhaps it sparked a thought somewhere, and perhaps that spark starts a fire,
somewhere, much later. There is practically no connection and that is fine. The
world moves and humanity is moved like a dreamer, one thought knows not the
next, and we all partake in that eternal digestion of the sleepless mind. Our
books, our journals, our blogs, our posts, they all participate. Perhaps we
fall for those waves of outrage and the galaxy brain has a seizure as we all
throw our weight around in unison, crushing innocent lives, leaving those we
hurt behind, forgetting them as quickly as we forget about the outrage.</p>

<p>Or perhaps blogging is leaving a trail of blazing sparks, each one sparking a
fire in the next generation. Spending time reading blogs and posts on social
media has certainly changed me.</p>

<p>Perhaps I would have grown older differently without reading blogs and blogging.
And this is why I cannot stop blogging.
To blog in that half-shadow where perhaps our thoughts are read and
perhaps they are not, where every text lights up and shines and drops and sinks
onto that great pile where thousands of text are rotting, that is to participate
in the galaxy brain that is our world. Some of us can vote and some of us can
talk. Some of us can fight and some of us will weep. I try to blog.</p>

<p>I try to blog to prove to myself that it was a struggle, that I tried to think
long and hard about things and that I tried to do the right thing. I keep
failing and so I must keep blogging.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Blogs">#Blogs</a></p>

<p>p1k3 wrote back in 2022:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Writing about writing. Programming about programming. Meetings about meetings. The mind reflecting on its own function. … Writing about writing might not have quite the same potential for nested, generative dysfunction, but it often produces artifacts just as unintelligible. – <a href="https://p1k3.com/2020/5/20/">meta meta</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>That quote seemed very appropriate for one of the two threads in my posts.
The other thread is about the audience and I got a comment on that, too, by the same author:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not that I have much to add here, but I do relate to this one.  The ongoing tension of these feelings contrasted with the sense that (as I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ve said many times before) existing in public seems almost entirely unsupportable to me now.  And yet:  Nothing else has quite the same power as writing for this audience you can never be sure of.  The one that might not even exist, but if it does might be all kinds of things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The pain of existing in public is a great way to put it.</p>

<p><strong>2024-03-08</strong>. How to overcome that impostor feeling where you reread that text you wrote and you want to throw it away.
Not worth the electrons it was written with! But who&rsquo;s doing the judging: you, or that imagined audience I was talking about?</p>

<p>I think the point of blogging is for there to be a tiny, non-threatening audience.
And really, who is going to read my blog?
Internet stranger-friends, mutuals on fedi, those kinds of people. Maybe my parents. (Hi mom!)
I can always anonymoblog somewhere else if I&rsquo;m feeling anxious.
Because writing in a paper notebook I don&rsquo;t feel judged.
Surely there&rsquo;s a similar place, online.
The key is to find that happy state where the imagined audience adds a little zest but not the Twitter wolves or Hacker News, or whatever the particular blogging nightmare might be.</p>

<p>For me, this imagined audience is more important than getting it right. Which is why I write my blog posts with the wiki spirit.
All these sites are pretty similar, in essence. Blog, wiki, digital garden, Zettelkasten, there&rsquo;s not enough difference to draw lines.
It&rsquo;s all a question of intent, of culture, of belonging.
The blog spirit is to write pages over time, and they disappear into the archive.
The digital garden spirit is to write unfinished articles and papers, to be refined or not.
The Zettelkasten spirit is to follow the trail of thoughts you thought and add new branches, small notes with new thoughts leading to more thoughts on new notes.
And the wiki spirit is to write and edit online, to hit the Save button and then it&rsquo;s live.
There is no editor, there is no draft. Wiki is like brutalism in content management.
I can see the page sources and the end result is obvious and full of that old web power.
It&rsquo;s not an app. The software has no idea of process.
The wiki spirit is to open that window, write the text and hit save.
And then I read it again, and edit it.
And tomorrow, I read it again, and edit it.
And next week, perhaps, I read it again, and edit it.</p>

<p>I no longer live in the <a href="https://communitywiki.org/wiki/WikiNow">Wiki Now</a>. The pages are intended for future readers but they are not timeless. I add timestamps all over the place. The blog spirit is strong. The pages do disappear into the great compost of thoughts.
The archive gobbles them up. I do go back but I don&rsquo;t rewrite the pages completely.
I&rsquo;m more likely to simply add a timestamp and some thoughts like I did on this page.</p>

<p>I do remove stuff I stumble across that I don&rsquo;t like at all.
I do leave some bad things in there to remind me of bad decisions made, of bad opinions held.</p>

<p>What I want to say, most of all, is that blog posts aren&rsquo;t gems.
They are not precious books. They are not newspaper articles. They are not job applications.
And if I don&rsquo;t like it tomorrow, I edit it. I revise it.
Or I write a new page saying how I learned something, or regret something, or I add something.
I add stuff to the bottom of pages or I add new pages.
What I don&rsquo;t do is polish the old posts.
There will be more great posts in the future.
The important part is the writing.</p>

<p><strong>2024-03-09</strong>. I’m reading <a href="http://perfors.net/blog/creation-ai/">The work of creation in the age of AI</a> by Andrew Perfors and thinking about the part where meaning is discussed.</p>

<p>Meaning without an audience:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If I am writing an essay or diary entry to myself, the goal is … generally to clarify my own thoughts, to identify flaws in my thinking, or to distil the logic and motivations behind my ideas. I might have a more emotional goal - I might want to vent to myself or to express a feeling. I might want to improve my emotional regulation, feel better about life, or change those feelings somehow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then with an audience:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>… once I decided I might actually want to post it, I changed it in important ways. I included a lot more explanation of things that were clear in my head but I thought would be non-obvious to others (and, in so doing, often I clarified them for myself too!). I fiddled with the structure and the argument flow, took some things out, put others in.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I got an email from <a class="account" href="https://merveilles.town/@bouncepaw" title="@bouncepaw@merveilles.town">@bouncepaw</a> with a link to <a href="https://links.bouncepaw.com/1188">a reply</a>. Thanks!</p>

<p>This is how it starts:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This article gets better every time I open it because Alex adds something to it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wrote about my propensity to “add” to pages up above (I’m doing it again!) and perhaps this would be a good place to talk about the two “views” for this site: blog &amp; wiki.</p>

<p>A blog is organized by the timeline. The <a href="index">Home</a> page lists all the pages in the order of their creation.</p>

<p>A wiki is organized by Recent Changes. The <a href="changes">Changes</a> page lists all the pages recently edited (unless I unset a checkbox).</p>

<p>So this site has both natures. And both views have a feed: <a href="index.rss">blog feed</a> &amp; <a href="changes.rss">wiki feed</a>.</p>

<p>I think you need quite some wiki-affinity to subscribe to the wiki feed. But it’s there for you.</p>

<p><strong>2024-03-10</strong>. Got another reply by email, <a href="//redterminal.org/gemlog/2024-03-10-Re_Why_do_we_even_blog.gmi">by fab</a> – who hosts their site on Gopher, Gemini, and the web. Reminds me of the time I had a working <a href="Gopher">Gopher</a> setup. And now I’m remembering the endless bot spiders. Yikes. I still think there should be a way to better control the bots.</p>

<p><strong>2024-03-11</strong>. Dozens also wrote a blog about blogging!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You may be wondering where blogs come from and why you would do a blog. If so, keep reading! – <a href="https://chrismanbrown.gitlab.io/46.html">doing a blog</a></p>

And none of the big journalists even asked the question -- where is this asshole coming from. Our journalists, today, who protest that we need them to keep our democracy, and then they assassinate it. When are we ever going to stand up and put a stop to this. BTW, Substack where she hosts her incredible writing, makes it impossible to find a web link to a story you recieve via email. It's very easy to get to the article in their app. I prefer the open web, and always will. I don't want Substack's app. Because I couldn't find the URL, even by searching for it, I can't give it to you. Sorry.

## 2024-03-13 Marking the Web’s 35th Birthday: A Shorter Letter

date: 2024-03-13, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-03-13-marking-the-web-s-35th-birthday-a-shorter-letter">2024-03-13 Marking the Web’s 35th Birthday: A Shorter Letter</h1>

<p>I think there are people with more interesting ideas than what Tim Berners-Lee has to say, given what I just read. <a href="https://medium.com/@timberners_lee/marking-the-webs-35th-birthday-an-open-letter-ebb410cc7d42">His post</a> is on Medium so I had to read in eww, the browser built into Emacs. 😂 The most interesting fragment was this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>collectivise their solutions, and … overturn the online world being dictated by profit to one that is dictated by the needs of humanity</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s pretty much out of context because it follows something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>there is a need, an urgent need, for others to do the same, to back the morally courageous leadership that is rising</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How weird is that? I started thinking. Where is that morally courageous leadership that is rising? Are they morally courageous but not in other ways? Is their morality courageous because their morals aren&rsquo;t recognized as morals or their morals might seem amoral to others? Or is amorality considered moral in the mainstream? Or isn&rsquo;t it rather that the mainstream knows full well what is moral but can&rsquo;t help the systemic pressures of having to earn money? Why isn&rsquo;t he advocating for system change? Is that what collectivisation is about? What exactly are we collectivising? The solutions? The products? The capital? Or is he just saying that the morally ambiguous but courageous leaders have ideas that we, collectively, ought to support? And the &ldquo;fundamental change&rdquo; he has in mind are &ldquo;Contract for the Web&rdquo; and &ldquo;Solid Protocol&rdquo;? I… I don&rsquo;t know… We must &ldquo;champion the efforts of those visionary individuals who are actively working to build a new, improved system&rdquo;? It just feels so weird. How about this alternative:</p>

<ol>
<li>We need a web that is built for the people, by the people.</li>
<li>We need free ourselves from the shackles and fetters of corporations.</li>
<li>Remove corporations and their representatives from all governing bodies and committees.</li>
<li>All positions to be paid positions. Don&rsquo;t let those on the corporate payrolls take over.</li>
<li>One human, one vote. No strings attached. Don&rsquo;t tie votes to membership fees. This is for all of humanity.</li>
</ol>

<p>It took me two minutes to write something that seemed a bit more visionary than what Tim Berners-Lee had in mind and if you like it, please don&rsquo;t champion me but talk to some friends and do a little thing, no matter how small, to support a few more people on the web. Run a forum, a wiki, provide email services, run a fediverse instance, run a HTML course at the library, collect money for a mutual aid fund, something, anything. The only conditions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>it must be a concrete thing that you are actually doing</li>
<li>it must benefit more people than are involved in doing it</li>
</ol>

<p>It&rsquo;s OK to cap it. But it&rsquo;s important to start it. Just make it a point to enable somebody else. And just like that, we&rsquo;re taking back the web.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Web">#Web</a></p>

<p><a class="account" href="https://social.piewpiew.se/@ohyran" title="@ohyran@social.piewpiew.se">@ohyran</a> commented on fedi:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Its hardware all the way down&rdquo;. The internet created this fantasy of a secondary realm outside of the physical confines of our reality - that allowed us to think that the person who controlled the narrative in that alternative universe had some control. In fact the people in control of hardware, if that&rsquo;s servers or cables or switches, are in control. There is no second reality.</p>

## Intel continues prepping the Linux kernel for X86S

date: 2024-03-13, from: OS News

Nearly one year ago Intel published the X86S specification (formerly stylized as &#8220;X86-S&#8221;) for simplifying the Intel architecture by removing support for 16-bit and 32-bit operating systems. X86S is a big step forward with dropping legacy mode, 5-level paging improvements, and other modernization improvements for x86_64. With the Linux 6.9 kernel more x86S bits are in place for this ongoing effort. ↫ Michael Larabel I doubt we&#8217;ll see much fallout from these changes.

## Cheers! NASA’s Webb Finds Ethanol, Other Icy Ingredients for Worlds

date: 2024-03-13, from: NASA breaking news

They went from being a team that could barely put a starting five on the court to having the deepest bench in the NBA. I was trying to do the math, but came up empty. They were absolutely unstoppable. Now that they have two superstars on the court at once, the opposing team can't just double or triple-team the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson">one player</a>, it's basically impossible to defend against their schtick. At the same time, the Knicks are great at defense. When the <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10112788-knicks-tom-thibodeau-provides-julius-randle-update-amid-shoulder-injury-rehab">second injured player</a> comes back, and it seems that will be soon, we might be back in the January mode that was so exciting. Even so, last night's game was a return to greatness. They blew out the 76ers, something that would have been unthinkable a couple of years ago. It's fun being a Knicks fan again! <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">❤️</span>

Can't tell you how many times, as a developer, I wanted this. To get it going it'll need at least a couple of compelling apps, to seed the bootstrap. Like <a href="http://scripting.com/2013/01/24/whatAboutMacwriteAndMacpaint.html">MacWrite and MacPaint</a> for the Mac. Without that, it can't even begin. I could help with their bootstrap if I had some belief they had would not crush developers, which is harder to do than it sounds. The only times it has worked for me, for a little while, was when I created the platform and apps and content (you need all three). But the huge companies have no vision for the role of developers, so these things rarely even get off the ground, and who's going to sign up to believe in the goodness of a huge company. It's a very steep road TBL has chosen to travel. I have argued with my friends at Automattic that they are in a golden position to do this since they already have a large installed base product that's popular with users, and lots of developers who could make good use of storage attached to each account. I hope someone with deep pockets and longevity does it. Then we can really start building an app ecosystem on the net. We've been doing this for 35 years as TBL points out, and we still haven't created an economic developer ecosystem on the web. Storage, believe it or not, is the big missing piece.

## Subject codes, incomplete and unreliable, have got to go

date: 2024-03-13, from: Crossref Blog

<p>Subject classifications have been available via the REST API for many years but have not been complete or reliable from the start and will soon be deprecated.</p>
<p>The <code>subject</code> metadata element was born out of a Labs experiment intended to enrich the metadata returned via Crossref Metadata Search with All Subject Journal Classification codes from Scopus. This feature was developed when the REST API was still fairly new, and we now recognize that the initial implementation worked its way into the service prematurely.</p>
<p>While subject classifications in Crossref metadata could be very useful, the current implementation in the REST API is problematic for three primary reasons:</p>
<p><strong>They are misleadingly exposed in the API as a property of the work,</strong> when in fact they are a property of the container (e.g. a journal or conference proceeding). Just because a journal’s broad topic category is “X” doesn’t mean that a particular article in the journal is about “X.”</p>
<p><strong>Existing works may have outdated subjects.</strong> Originally, subject codes were not updated periodically. However, subjects exposed in the /journals route are now updated once a day. Those exposed via the /works endpoint are indexed along with works, and so when a new subject list is ingested, new DOIs start getting new subjects, but existing works may have outdated subjects. We don’t have a mechanism for forcing updates when incorrect subject values are returned via the REST API, so this data can be stale and incorrect.</p>
<p><strong>They are not applied to everything.</strong> This is because the Scopus list does not cover all the journals that Crossref has (conversely, the Scopus list contains some journals Crossref does not have), and does not contain other container types.</p>
<p>The Labs team investigated options for improving subject classification coverage but ultimately concluded that there are insufficient solutions to the coverage problem. For more, please see Esha Datta’s findings published at Force11’s Upstream: <a href="https://doi.org/10.54900/n6dnt-xpq48" target="_blank">https://doi.org/10.54900/n6dnt-xpq48</a></p>
<p>Where does that leave us? Rather than continuing to supply unreliable and misleading subject category metadata, we will be deprecating this feature in the coming weeks. To minimize disruption and avoid breaking changes at this time, we will be removing this data from our index, so the subject element will simply be empty. We may remove the <code>subject</code> element in the future.</p>
<p>We know that the community’s desire for subject-based analysis of metadata is very strong, and we have supported efforts to establish a multidisciplinary taxonomy. Inaccurate codes in the meantime do not help but actually hinder these efforts, giving the false impression that they are correct.</p>
<p>We aim to deprecate the subject codes in April of this year.</p>
<p>Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns by leaving a comment below, which will start a thread in our community forum.</p>
<p><strong>Frequently asked questions</strong></p>
<p>Q. Will the subject field continue to be available and functional?<br>
A. The subject metadata element will continue to be included in the JSON response but will not return any values.</p>
<p>Q. Will new subject codes be added in the future?<br>
A. We do not have any current plans to add new subject codes in the future.</p>
<p>Q. I received a notification about this, but we don’t use subject codes. Do I need to do anything?<br>
A. No, if you do not currently use the <code>subject</code> element, you do not need to do anything about this change.</p>
<p>Q. I noticed that wrong or inaccurate subject codes were assigned to my works. Is this a solution?<br>
A. Yes. Until we can identify an accurate and sustainable system for assigning subject codes to Crossref metadata records, we want to stop assigning inaccurate subject codes and remove all existing assignments.</p>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-03-12, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

We need a protocol for embedding a tweet in a web page. We used to have one with Twitter, but it now works only intermittently. Mastodon has one, and I have been able to use it. But really it would be nice to have a sort of jQuery of this stuff. If they're all going to create their own APIs we obviously need a container for that so developers don't have to worry about all of it.

## Rebooting the blogroll bootstrap

<p>Manton is doing <a href="https://www.threads.net/@manton/post/C4ayOPGO08R">great work</a>.</p>
<p>His <a href="https://micro.blog/">micro.blog</a> system is pioneering a new form of blogrolls.</p>
<p>We've been working together behind the scenes to make sure his stuff interops with mine.</p>
<p>That's imho the best part.</p>
<p>PS: Blogrolls is where the social web started.</p>
<p>PPS: I have to write a short "what is a blogroll" doc, re OPML and RSS. There's not a lot to it. So it needs to be written down. Will do.</p>
<p>PPPS: I'm having flashbacks to <a href="http://manila.userland.com/">Manila</a>. We're using GitHub more or less the same way. We had a better scripting system. I also know that WordPress can be that too, and plan to use that in my software.  </p>

In the 80 years since the shocking collapse of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge in Washington, engineers have designed suspended structures to minimize their universal weakness: resonance.

Do we have enough fuel to get to our destination? This is probably one of the first questions that comes to mind whenever your family gets ready to embark on a road trip.

## European Commission’s use of Microsoft 365 infringes data protection law for EU institutions and bodies

Following its investigation, the EDPS has found that the European Commission (Commission) has infringed several key data protection rules when using Microsoft 365.

The massive amounts of fines and corrective actions handed out to EU companies in all kinds of sectors already disprove this notion, and here&#8217;s a case where even the European Commission itself gets a slap on the wrist for violating its own rules and regulations &#8211; rules and regulations, we&#8217;re often told by especially American corporatists, are designed specifically to target poor American businesses.

## AI and the NYT

date: 2024-03-12, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Zach Seward, a friend from my days at <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/about/">Harvard</a> and NYU, got a kickass <a href="https://www.nytco.com/press/zach-seward-is-the-newsrooms-editorial-director-of-a-i-initiatives/">job</a>, starting up the AI effort at the NYT.  He's just the right guy for it. Young, curious, creative, and very ambitious. And he has a strong startup journalism background. I couldn't think of anyone I'd want more to be in this position. </p>
<p>Now that he's published <a href="https://www.zachseward.com/ai-news-thats-fit-to-print-sxsw-2024/?ref=zach-seward-newsletter">notes</a> for a talk he gave at SXSW, it's time to share some ideas I have for the NYT re AI.</p>
<ul>
<li>Current events. This is something ChatGPT doesn't do. Not sure why. I'd like to be able to connect to <a href="https://ai.nytimes.com/">ai.nytimes.com</a> and ask it to give me a rundown on the <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/03/09.html#a200615">lawyer</a> who's testifying in Congress today about how our president is "elderly." I don't want pointers to stories, though they should be included in the response, I want a custom report, like the ones ChatGPT provides, that answers the questions I have about the MAGA lawyer. Maybe the AI will just give me the story without the spin. </li>
<li>More useful NYT archives. When I was a kid I spent so much time at the <a href="https://www.queenslibrary.org/about-us/locations/central-library">big library</a> in Jamaica (Queens)  going back through microfilm of the NYT from before I was born. So far all we've done is replicate the microfilm user experience (which is great and very useful) but the thing that ChatGPT does so well is prepare custom reports. All that source material, used to answer very specific questions. Answer questions like "has anything notorious happened in the neighborhood I grew up in, as far as the NYT knows?"</li>
<li>Sell a service to your readers where you manage the archive of their blogs, and in doing so you create a much broader archive for historians, journalists and others to study in the future, and, in the context of AI, feed it all kinds of perspective on the time we live in. Maybe in the future history won't be written by the winners (lotsa luck with that). Anyway, if at some point the NYT and other journalism outlets will harness the energy, knowledge and intelligence of the readers, why not start now? </li>
</ul>
<p>I criticize the NYT a lot, I know. But that <a href="http://scripting.com/2018/06/24/181734.html">means</a> I care. When I stop criticizing you'll know that I've given up. </p>

## The Next Accident: How Do We Prevent It?

## Operational Modal Analysis of the Artemis I Dynamic Rollout Test

Operational modal analysis (OMA) techniques have been used to identify the modal characteristics of the Artemis I launch vehicle during the Dynamic Rollout Test (DRT) and Wet Dress Rehearsal (WDR) configuration prior to launch. Forces induced during rollout and on the launch pad are not directly measurable, thus necessitating a unique approach. NASA is developing [&#8230;]

## 2024-02-28 Use of a calendar

date: 2024-03-12, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-02-28-use-of-a-calendar">2024-02-28 Use of a calendar</h1>

<p>In the last millennium, I used the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Diary.html">Emacs Diary</a> for my calendar. I mean, why not? The <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Calendar_002fDiary.html">Emacs Calendar</a> is great. Better than the <code>cal</code> command-line utility, in any case. But eventually the world got mobile phones and I wanted an online calendar.</p>

<p>The example from the Emacs Diary documentation:</p>

<pre><code>12/22/2015  Twentieth wedding anniversary!
10/22       Ruth's birthday.
* 21, *:    Payday
Tuesday--weekly meeting with grad students at 10am
         Supowit, Shen, Bitner, and Kapoor to attend.
1/13/89     Friday the thirteenth!!
thu 4pm     squash game with Lloyd.
mar 16      Dad's birthday
April 15, 2016 Income tax due.
* 15        time cards due.
</code></pre>

<p>Back then, Google didn&rsquo;t want to be evil and I used Google Calendar.
When Google changed its mind, so did I.
I switched to <a href="2020-06-10_Radicale_for_Calendar_and_Contacts">Radicale</a>.</p>

<p>And yet, I sort of missed those diary file entries.</p>

<p>Today, <a class="account" href="https://social.tadzik.net/users/tadzik" title="@tadzik@social.tadzik.net">@tadzik</a> posted a link to <a href="https://codeberg.org/tadzik/caleb">caleb</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><code>caleb</code> will do its best to interpret a calendar event description, create a valid iCalendar event for it and optionally upload it to a CalDAV server.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nice!</p>

<p>Example usage, from the README:</p>

<pre><code>$ caleb friday 5pm beer
</code></pre>

<p>My main problem was that it took me a while to figure out what the correct <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CalDAV">CalDAV</a> URL is. I looked into my iPhone accounts (my first mistake) and tried <code>https://example.org/radicale/alex</code>, then <code>https://example.org/radicale/alex/</code>, then <code>https://example.org/radicale/alex/Alex</code> – some of these URLs failed silently, some of them created new collections with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar">iCalendar</a> filename as the collection name… and I didn&rsquo;t get an warnings or error messages. I mean, it makes sense. It&rsquo;s like a filesystem, you can save whatever you want. But it&rsquo;s not what the calendar apps expect.</p>

<p>So, how do I discover the correct URL? Using a command-line <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV">WebDAV</a> explorer like <code>cadaver</code>. The following example shows how I log into Radicale and list the contents of the two directory I found. One of them is full of <code>.vcf</code> files (contacts), the other is full of <code>.ics</code> files (calendar entries). That&rsquo;s the one!</p>

<p>The funny thing is, I <em>don't</em> have that error when I'm running CLI commands, like <code>vendor/bin/drush</code>, and can even install and manage the Drupal site and database on the CLI.</p>

## Messy ToS update allegedly locks Roku devices until users give in

date: 2024-03-11, from: OS News

Roku customers are threatening to stop using, or to even dispose of, their low-priced TVs and streaming gadgets after the company appears to be locking devices for people who don&#8217;t conform to the recently updated terms of service (ToS). This month, users on Roku&#8217;s support forums reported suddenly seeing a message when turning on their Roku TV or streaming device reading: &#8220;We&#8217;ve made an important update: We’ve updated our Dispute Resolution Terms. Select ‘Agree’ to agree to these updated Terms and to continue enjoying our products and services. Press * to view these updated Terms.&#8221; A large button reading &#8220;Agree&#8221; follows. The pop-up doesn&#8217;t offer a way to disagree, and users are unable to use their device unless they hit agree. ↫ Scharon Harding at Ars Technica The best part of this story? And by best I mean worst? You have to send a letter &#8211; a paper one, with stamps and everything, like in the before times &#8211; to Roku&#8217;s lawyer in California containing the names of all the people opting out, the devices and services in question, and a damn purchase receipt.

## Image-scraping Midjourney bans rival “AI” firm for scraping images

date: 2024-03-11, from: OS News

On Wednesday, Midjourney banned all employees from image synthesis rival Stability AI from its service indefinitely after it detected &#8220;botnet-like&#8221; activity suspected to be a Stability employee attempting to scrape prompt and image pairs in bulk. Midjourney advocate Nick St. Pierre tweeted about the announcement, which came via Midjourney&#8217;s official Discord channel. ↫ Benj Edwards So &#8220;AI&#8221; companies are allowed to ingest whatever data they want, but as soon as someone ingests their data, it&#8217;s suddenly a problem? Seems like a sound business model.

## Mac Dialog in Auto Layout vs. SwiftUI

date: 2024-03-11, from: Michael Tsai

Christian Tietze (Mastodon): On Mastodon, we had a discussion about whether you are more or less productive with SwiftUI or UIKit/AppKit. Der Teilweise (@teilweise@layer8.space) chimed in with an actual, measurable benchmark: a flexible-width window, with reflowing text, and equal-size buttons. Doable in 10 minutes. Can SwiftUI beat this? [&#8230;] Here&#8217;s the reference implementation on GitHub. [&#8230;]

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-03-11, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

Journalism talks about Trump's trials, but they are trials for the Constitution too. If Trump is guilty (spoiler: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump%E2%80%93Raffensperger_phone_call">he is</a>) then if he isn't punished we no longer have the rule of law. So don't miss that we are on trial too. And -- when journalism frames the faceoff as Democrat vs Republican, they ignore us, the people of the United States. Whether people know it or not, they will lose if the Republicans win. We know that, it's provable. And anything that's true should be built into the stories journalism writes about.

## Better, faster, stronger time zone updates on Android

date: 2024-03-11, from: OS News

From the beginning, time zone rules were a component in Mainline, called Time Zone Data or tzdata module. This integration allowed us to react more quickly to government-mandated time zone changes than before. However until 2023 tzdata updates were still bundled with other Mainline changes, sometimes leading to testing complexities and slower deployment. In 2023, we made further investments in Mainline&#8217;s infrastructure and decoupled the tzdata module from the other components. With this isolation, we gained the ability to respond rapidly to time zone legislation changes — often releasing updates to Android users outside of the established release cadence. Additionally, this change means time zone updates can reach a far greater number of Android devices, ensuring you as Android users always see the correct time. ↫ Almaz Mingaleev and Masha Khokhlova This is equal parts boring and equal parts amazing. The amount of work developers have to put into making sure timezones work is astonishing, and the fact that a large chunk of it is done by volunteers is even more impressive.

## Oh servers!

date: 2024-03-11, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>The other day I wrote proudly that we had better more reliable server software in 2024 than we did the first time we bootstrapped blogging communities. </p>
<p>And then this happened...</p>
<p>We've been having serious problems on <a href="https://feedland.com/">feedland.com</a> since Friday when I made a software version mistake. At first it caused the server to crash when you tried to subscribe to a new feed, so you'd get an awful error message, either from the FeedLand website, or the browser, saying the server had gone away. I quickly fixed that problem and another, and restored the server to some basic functionality. But when I did some work on my account over the weekend, I saw that there were new errors. And then noticed that none of my feeds had updated since March 8, they still haven't. </p>
<p>We're going to fix it this morning, by reverting the server software to the version as it was before the update, and the server should return to its previous reliability, Murphy-willing. Then we're going to upgrade the database, and then install the new software, and try again. That won't happen today and probably not tomorrow. </p>
<p>Most people probably don't know that feedland.com is a project I'm doing with Automattic. It's running in their cloud. This system should be able to scale up in ways that a Digital Ocean droplet can't, where feedland.org and the new feedland.social are running. So when there are many thousands of users, we should be okay. That's why I did the work to convert FeedLand so everything is stored in the SQL database, and nothing in the file system, among other changes that had to be made last year, like getting off Twitter for identity. That was not much fun, but it had to be done. </p>
<p>Anyway I am very sorry and embarrassed for the unreliable performance on our main server in the last few days. I can't promise it won't happen again, but we learned a lot in this experience, and in some cases re-learned. </p>
<p>It's even worse than it appears and as they say -- still diggin! </p>

Last night's <a href="http://scripting.com/email">email</a> was a repeat of Saturday's. The reason was the switch to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time">Daylight Savings Time</a>. This happens every year. The fix is to edit stats.json in the mail sender app's folder, and change <code>whenLastUpdate</code> to the day before, save it, and restart the sender app. It immediately sends out the correct email. I put this note here so I might find it next time it happens and I forget how to fix it. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>

## House panel unanimously approves bill that could ban TikTok

date: 2024-03-10, from: OS News

A powerful House committee advanced a bill on Thursday that could lead to a nationwide ban against TikTok on all electronic devices, renewing lawmakers’ challenge to one of the world’s most popular social media apps and highlighting unresolved fears that TikTok may pose a Chinese government spying risk. The measure that sailed unanimously through the House Energy and Commerce Committee would prohibit TikTok from US app stores unless the social media platform — used by roughly 170 million Americans — is quickly spun off from its China-linked parent company, ByteDance. ↫ Brian Fung at CNN TikTok obviously needs to be banned. It&#8217;s an extension of a genocidal, totalitarian government that has no place on our our phones. Yes, I understand Facebook, Apple, Google, Microsoft also collect vast amounts of data, but at least they are (nominally) beholden to our legal systems, and while there is, of course, a vast power imbalance between us as individuals and them as megacorporations, it&#8217;s still nowhere even close as to being an arm of a totalitarian government &#8211; they&#8217;re just not comparable. China&#8217;s state surveillance tools have no place on our devices.

I like product names that begin with F, esp if you come from the Mac -- where the <i>Finder</i> is the app you spend a lot of time in. So Frontier was a good name simply because it was two syllables and began with F. I know it's weird. It's also why FeedLand feels like a homey name to me. :-)

## Wizard Lore – a new game from AMCOG

date: 2024-03-10, from: RiscOS Story

Attendees of the recent Southwest Show will have had the opportunity to try out and buy the latest title from AMCOG Games, and it is now available to everyone else to purchase from !Store. In the game, you play a wizard who has suffered imprisonment and an amnesia spell at the hands of the evil Igen, your nemesis. However, while the amnesia spell worked in the main, it didn&#8217;t take completely, and you are still able to remember how to cast three spells. You are still able to levitate objects,&#8230;

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-03-10, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

Good morning. Here's the <a href="http://scripting.com/code/testing/tabstest3/">next tabs test</a>. Yesterday's test showed that tabs that switching between images is fine. The tabs never get hung up. Today's test is the same except one of the tabs is a FeedLand timeline. I want to see if somehow click events are getting lost on their way to the tabs manager.

## The Apple curl security incident 12604

date: 2024-03-10, from: OS News

When this command line option is used with curl on macOS, the version shipped by Apple, it seems to fall back and checks the system CA store in case the provided set of CA certs fail the verification. A secondary check that was not asked for, is not documented and plain frankly comes completely by surprise. Therefore, when a user runs the check with a trimmed and dedicated CA cert file, it will not fail if the system CA store contains a cert that can verify the server! This is a security problem because now suddenly certificate checks pass that should not pass. ↫ Daniel Stenberg Absolutely wild that Apple does not consider this a security issue.
