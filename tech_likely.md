## Securing Virtual Machines on Apple Silicon

date: 2024-08-02, from: Michael Tsai

Howard Oakley: In addition to Sequoia VMs on Apple silicon Macs being able to use services such as iCloud using Apple ID, they now appear able to support full-strength FileVault when Apple ID is activated. This contrasts with FileVault supported by previous macOS guests, which appears comparable to that provided by Intel Macs without T2 [&#8230;]

## The Switch From File Paths to URLs

date: 2024-08-02, from: Michael Tsai

Quinn: I don&#8217;t think we ever documented this officially, but to understand this choice you have to look at the history of macOS. Traditional Mac OS did not use paths a lot. Rather, files were identified by an FSSpec, which contains a volume identifier, a directory ID, and a name. The directory ID was an [&#8230;]

## Snapshots Aren’t Backups

date: 2024-08-02, from: Michael Tsai

Howard Oakley: What is different is that restoring a whole volume from a snapshot is a one-way trip, and there is no undo. This is because snapshots subsequent to that used to restore from will be removed, and you won&#8217;t then be able to &#8216;roll forward&#8217; to a later snapshot. That contrasts with a normal [&#8230;]

## Override xdg-open behavior with xdg-override

date: 2024-08-02, from: OS News

Most application on GNU/Linux by convention delegate to xdg-open when they need to open a file or a URL. This ensures consistent behavior between applications and desktop environments: URLs are always opened in our preferred browser, images are always opened in the same preferred viewer. However, there are situations when this consistent behavior is not desired: for example, if we need to override default browser just for one application and only temporarily. This is where xdg-override helps: it replaces xdg-open with itself to alter the behavior without changing system settings. ↫ xdg-override GitHub page I love this project ever since I came across it a few days ago. Not because I need it &#8211; I really don&#8217;t &#8211; but because of the story behind its creation. The author of the tool, Dmytro Kostiuchenko, wanted Slack, which he only uses for work, to only open his work browser &#8211; which is a different browser from his default browser. For example, imagine you normally use Firefox for everything, but for all your work-related things, you use Chrome. So, when you open a link sent to you in Slack by a colleague, you want that specific link to open in Chrome. Well, this is not easily achieved in Linux. Applications on Linux tend to use freedesktop.org&#8217;s xdg-open for this, which looks at the file mimeapps.list to learn which application opens which file type or URL. To solve Kostiuchenko&#8217;s issue, changing the variable $XDG_CONFIG_HOME just for Slack to point xdg-open to a different configuration file doesn&#8217;t work, because the setting will be inherited by everything else spwaned from Slack itself. Changing mimeapps.list doesn&#8217;t work either, of course, since that would affect all other applications, too. So, what&#8217;s the actual solution? We’d like also not to change xdg-open implementation globally in our system: ideally, the change should only affect Slack, not all other apps. But foremost, diverging from upstream is very unpractical. However, in the spirit of this solution, we can introduce a proxy implementation of xdg-open, which we’ll &#8220;inject&#8221; into Slack by adding it to PATH. ↫ Dmytro Kostiuchenko xdg-override takes this idea and runs with it: It is based on the idea described above, but the script won’t generate proxy implementation. Instead, xdg-override will copy itself to /tmp/xdg-override-$USER/xdg-open and will set a few $XDG_OVERRIDE_* variables and the $PATH. When xdg-override is invoked from this new location as xdg-open, it’ll operate in a different mode, parsing $XDG_OVERRIDE_MATCH and dispatching the call appropriately. I tested this script briefly, but automated tests are missing, so expect some rough edges and bugs. ↫ Dmytro Kostiuchenko I don&#8217;t fully understand how it works, but I get the overall gist of what it&#8217;s doing. I think it&#8217;s quite clever, and solves a very specific issue in a non-destructive way. While it&#8217;s not something most people will ever need, it feels like something that if you do need it, it will quickly become a default part of your toolbox or workflow.

## NASA Scientists on Why We Might Not Spot Solar Panel Technosignatures

date: 2024-08-02, from: NASA breaking news

One of NASA’s key priorities is understanding the potential for life elsewhere in the universe. NASA has not found any credible evidence of extraterrestrial life — but NASA is exploring the solar system and beyond to help us answer fundamental questions, including whether we are alone in the universe. For those who study the potential […]

“When I was around 16 or 17, I came across this book by Arthur C. Clarke called Space Odyssey 2001. That was actually the first science fiction book that I&#8217;ve ever read.

## Technology history: where Unix came from

date: 2024-08-02, from: OS News

Today, every Unix-like system can trace their ancestry back to the original Unix. That includes Linux, which uses the GNU tools – and the GNU tools are based on the Unix tools. Linux in 2024 is removed from the original Unix design, and for good reason – Linux supports architectures and tools not dreamt of during the original Unix era. But the core command line experience in Linux is still very similar to the Unix command line of the 1970s. The next time you use ls to list the files in a directory, remember that you’re using a command line that’s been with us for more than fifty years. ↫ Jim Hall An excellent overview of some of the more ancient UNIX commands that are still with us today. One thing I always appreciate when I dive into an operating system closer to &#8220;real&#8221; UNIX, like OpenBSD, or a actual UNIX, like HP-UX, is just how much more logical sense they make under the hood than a Linux system does. This is not a dunk on modern Linux &#8211; it has to cater to endless more modern needs than something ancient and dead like HP-UX &#8211; but what I learn while using these systems closer to the UNIX has made me appreciate proper UNIX more than I used to in the past. In what surely sounds like utter lunacy to system administrators who actually had to seriously administer HP-UX systems back in the day, I genuinely love using HP-UX, setting it up, configuring it, messing around with it, because it just makes so much more logical sense than the systems we use today. The knowledge gained from using BSD, HP-UX, and others, while not always directly applicable to Linux, does aid me in understanding certain Linux things better than I did before. What I&#8217;m trying to say is &#8211; go and load up an old UNIX, or at least a modern BSD. Aside from being great operating systems in their own right, they&#8217;re much easier to grasp than a modern Linux system, and you&#8217;ll learn a lot form the experience.

I was trying to find Tony Kahn on the web for a friend doing a documentary on the origins of podcasting, and came up empty. I just stumbled across him on Facebook and that led to <a href="https://www.tonykahn.org/home">this autobiographical site</a> where he tells his story of podcasting. Tony was the person who brought NPR into podcasting in 2004. A major contributor who isn't often credited. He was at WGBH at the time.

<hr />
<h2>Let's start from the basics: can you introduce yourself?</h2>
<p>Hello! My name is Anne Sturdivant, you will often find me online as "Apple Annie" or using the handle <code>anniegreens</code>. I give a little background on these names on my weblog: <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2023/01/origins-of-a-nickname">Origins of a nickname</a>. I am originally from Washington state in the US but have lived in Portland, OR, for about 20 years.</p>
<p>I moved to Portland to attend college (for the second time) and studied web design and interactive media, for which I received a BS. I continued on that course for my career for the last 16 years, working mainly on the front-end with Drupal, design systems, and structured content. I recently have been on a hiatus from full-time work due to health (and other) factors. I am still active in the front-end and web design spaces, also more recently jumping back into "work" on a personal level.</p>
<p>Hobbies are hard to define since so many things I enjoy doing and could categorize as hobbies are just a core part of me. I am a gardener but calling that a hobby feels like an understatement. My entire yard is a garden and I put every single plant in the ground. I post many photos and write a bit about it more on my <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol">microblog</a> than my weblog. I also travel to gardens in the Pacific Northwest and take photos and write about it in a newsletter that has been on hold for a while. I do plan on resuming this newsletter at some point, platform to be determined.</p>
<p>I also watch a fair amount of movies and television, mostly on streaming services, though I don't write about that much. I love listening to podcasts and find myself gravitating towards the weird and unusual, tech-related and front-end, US political news (though not what you might think, I really only listen to serious lawyers that don't get into hyperbolic punditry), and health-related and local subjects.</p>
<p>I read but am not a dedicated book reader, I find myself more drawn to blogs and the interlinking nature of the web. I do usually start this path in my RSS reader but very often a trail starts on Mastodon due to a post someone shares. I enjoy photography and hiking and visiting natural areas in the Pacific Northwest, also featured in my newsletter, but do less of that now (except photos of my garden) due to current health limitations.</p>
<p>I suppose you could call tinkering with front-end development a hobby as well, since nowadays I'm doing that for personal pleasure and growth, even if I am trained to do that as a career as well. I find this to be a creative outlet as much as other creative endeavors, including gardening, and I've written in the past about how I find both gardening and front-end development to share some of the same parts of my brain.</p>
<p>Finally, this "hobby" should lead us right into the next question: blogging!</p>
<h2>What's the story behind your blog?</h2>
<p>I have several blogs, it might be an addiction. I've written pretty extensively about my weblog, which I consider my main blog, and how it came to be. Part of my hiatus and worsening health issues were due to work-induced burnout and I spent several years away from the web, unsure I'd ever return. In 2022 I started to have the desire to once again do <em>something</em> on the web, though I was unsure what that would look like. I had a blog in college but long abandoned it, though it still sits on the same domain my old portfolio site sits on, locked behind a login.</p>
<p>After coming to Mastodon, I discovered an instance that was part of a paid suite of tools, <a href="https://home.omg.lol/referred-by/anniegreens">omg.lol</a>, and signed up after finding the Local timeline to be quite enjoyable (it's now my main instance). What I didn't realize was that the rest of the tools would become just as important to me. I first created a "link page" that now acts as my global profile, then a /now page, and a weblog, and a statuslog, and soon had also signed up for Micro.blog. I now have nine blogs, seven of them active, spread across omg.lol and Micro.blog.</p>
<p>As I said, the <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol">weblog</a> is my main blog and started as a way to get back into doing front-end development again and to write about it and the process of customizing the blog. I really started it for myself, to work my way out of burnout, as a means of therapy. I now post mostly longer form, often technical, posts about front-end development and web design, the indieweb, blogging, the internet, as well as some more personal pieces, and still the process of working on the blog.</p>
<p>I'd then consider my <a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol">microblog</a> a close second to the weblog. I post more short form content there, photo-blogging, bookmarks, gardening, chronic illness, as well as some politics and technology. I sometimes cross-post to one of my four Mastodon accounts.</p>
<p>My other blogs are more projects than traditional blogs. I have a trio of blogs that serve as one project for <a href="https://weblog.lol">weblog.lol</a>: <a href="https://themes.lol">Themes</a>, <a href="https://styles.themes.lol">Styles</a>, and <a href="https://custom.themes.lol">Custom</a>, which I use exclusively for weblog.lol styles and customizations to create themes. This work is on hold right now as weblog.lol's backend will be seeing some overhaul over the next few months and I'll need to reflect that there.</p>
<p><a href="https://3x5.pics">3x5.pics</a> is a fun project that I loved designing. I'm currently authoring all the messages on the notecards myself but I would like to open it up to submissions one day. Right now I'm working on the <a href="https://100daystooffload.com/">100 Days to Offload</a> challenge on a dedicated blog called <a href="https://100daysof.blog">100 Days of Blog</a>. Another microblog I haven't started yet, other than to obtain a domain and have a direction for it, will be for testing and modernizing a trove of old recipes I inherited from my grandmother. It is called Table for One Cafe. Finally, I have a sixth weblog.lol blog that I'm working to make a place for front-end experiments that I can include with blog posts on my main weblog. This is code named Tiny Pages.</p>
<h2>What does your creative process look like when it comes to blogging?</h2>
<p>For posts on my weblog, they are usually about something I worked on or a process/knowledge piece to share. For this type of post I put in a fair amount of research on a subject, create an outline, prepare assets or code samples, and citations and footnotes. These very often are about working on one of my blogs, adding a new feature, updating and improving something technical, or learning a modern and new piece of functionality within front-end development.</p>
<p>Personal pieces are far more spontaneous and may reflect how I am feeling or a struggle I am dealing with. Other posts are reactions to blog posts, articles, podcasts, and movies or television shows. I also try to post a near-daily featured photo on my microblog. Sometimes these are curated ahead of time, where I'll plan out a week of photos, but often they are a picture that the Apple Photos.app is featuring that day. I thought about the kinds of blogs posts once and <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2023/11/types-of-blog-posts">wrote something about it</a>, I'm not sure I've hit all of them yet!</p>
<p>I had many requests from the omg.lol community about what my weblog workflow was so I published a piece aptly titled <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/04/weblog-publishing-workflow"><em>Weblog Publishing Workflow</em></a>. In it I describe the tools I use, including <a href="https://getdrafts.com/">Drafts</a>, which I am writing these answers in right now. As far as how many drafts I write, I really can't tell you. The way Drafts works I never see a "draft" version, I'm just constantly reading and rewriting or reorganizing sections. One of the nice part of Drafts is being able to set up preview templates that look exactly like the front-end of your blog, using all the same assets, which I have stored on a CDN. When I read a piece for editing, I read it in that preview as it gives me the best feeling of how something will be seen once published on my weblog.</p>
<p>As for proof reading or asking for help in reviewing what I blog about, I haven't yet started to do that, but the idea has been in my mind for a while. I know I make mistakes and I will often find at least a couple after publishing, but I am not too worried about that. I'm fine airing my bumps and bruises. I would, however, appreciate a review on more technical pieces that I write in the future and may start looking for someone I trust to do that or that is willing to offer their time.</p>
<h2>Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe the physical space influences your creativity?</h2>
<p>I usually write in the morning or later at night, often with a cup of coffee or tea, nestled into my large chair with ottoman in my living room. I have a proper (and rather nice) office and I worked from home for many years at my last job, but I've since moved away from that strict feeling space for blogging or creative endeavors, unless I need an external monitor for something large or complicated that I want to see in a code editor or graphics program.</p>
<p>One thing that definitely influences my ability to write is sound. I don't necessarily mean I need to listen to music to be creative or to write, but if there is sound it cannot be dialogue or lyrics with music. For this reason I primarily listen to two highly curated Pandora stations I created many years ago. I also listen to them while working on design or technical projects, though often I prefer no sound at all.</p>
<p>If I'm already in the flow of something, either writing or working on a site or design, I will often listen to music, but also from one of those Pandora stations. I've been listening to them for so long, they are like a comfortable friend and may therefore help me feel at ease. I know creative spaces are important.</p>
<p>When I moved to Portland to attend an art college, I lived in a very inspiring neighborhood near my school and felt like a creative's dream every time I stepped onto the sidewalk. Now when I am stuck on something I find that just stepping out my back door into my garden is enough of an escape that when I return I can get past that block. In 2019 when I was at the worst of my burnout I planted a pollinator garden in my raised vegetable beds and could spend hours out there gazing at the flowers and wildlife. It was therapeutic, got the creative juices flowing, and a means to make the day pass.</p>
<h2>A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your tech stack?</h2>
<p>I assume most people answering these questions may run across the same thing as myself: I have written about this on my blog before. My weblog <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/colophon">Colophon</a> details much of this. The weblog is using <a href="https://weblog.lol">weblog.lol</a>, a small blogging platform that comes with an <a href="https://home.omg.lol/referred-by/anniegreens">omg.lol</a> address. There is a lightweight templating system that allows passing of variables with front-matter and config and authoring in Markdown and HTML, or a combination of the two. </p>
<p>All static assets are stored on my <a href="https://bunny.net/cdn/">CDN at Bunny.net</a>, the domain is registered at and DNS is currently managed by <a href="https://porkbun.com/">Porkbun</a> but I may moved to Bunny.net for DNS as well, which would serve weblog as a static site. Email for my domain is handled by <a href="https://www.fastmail.com/">Fastmail</a>. I have just recently added a contact form using <a href="https://letterbird.co/">Letterbird</a>. Analytics are using <a href="https://tinylytics.app/">Tinylytics</a> for the time being, though I am investigating self-hosting Umami for analytics with PikaPods.</p>
<p>The theme is entirely custom CSS and HTML with limited Javascript for theme switching and some web components. I mention in my workflow post that I desired to use a platform and workflow that didn't require a lot of maintenance overhead, such as updating modules, dependencies, and debugging build systems. I wanted the platform to get out of the way so I could work on the parts I want to work on and write about it. I love that there are so many diverse ways to blog right now, so many different options for complexity based on what people want to do or can do. And opportunities to do more when they want to and move to another platform as they need more features. There is no wrong way to blog and the best way is the way that makes it easiest for you.</p>
<p>My microblog is hosted on <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> and uses a community contributed theme called Tiny Theme as a base with custom CSS, some Javascript for web components, and template overrides to complement the look and feel of my weblog's theme. My other projects/blogs are also on one of these platforms: Themes, Styles, and Custom use weblog.lol; 3x5.pics and Tiny Pages use weblog.lol; and both 100 Days of Blog and Table for One Cafe are on Micro.blog.</p>
<h2>Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would you do anything differently?</h2>
<p>If I started over today, I'd be in a different head space and I like to think I would have "branched out" more and relied on my web development experience to build something more custom using 11ty or another static site generator. I have more experience with PHP so I might have gone in the direction of a PHP static site generator, but I appreciate and stay updated with what is happening with 11ty enough that I think I will end up using that some day.</p>
<p>Weblog.lol has some limitations and though I have gotten very far with truly making it my own, I started the blog in January 2023,  I've only just started hitting walls that I am unable to get past due to the platform's limitations. The next version of weblog will run on a new backend called Neato and I am willing to wait until that is ready to try out before making any moves to another platform.</p>
<p>I think it more likely I leave Micro.blog before I leave weblog.lol (or <a href="https://home.omg.lol/referred-by/anniegreens">omg.lol</a>). The original needs I had when I joined Micro.blog have either ended up being something I decided I didn't need (Fediverse integration), or I've found alternatives to some of its functionality (cross-posting), and the remaining piece I've yet to get set up, a newsletter, I already have options, such as Buttondown or Ghost, that I could use.</p>
<p>I am still very pleased with the structure of my weblog. I believe starting with a Styleguide up front helped me to keep styling consistent by structuring the content and front-matter properly from fairly early on. The only structure that I find lacking is, again, due to the platform's limitations. Having come from more than a decade of working on Drupal platforms, I can see gaps in functionality that other platforms might give me the flexibility to fill.</p>
<p>As for the name of my weblog, I'm glad this was brought up in the suggestions—I <em>love</em> when a blog has a name! I curate a blogroll by "spinning" it with nine new blogs at a time at no particular regularity. In the process of doing so I come across the "name" of each blog by peaking at the HTML <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> and I am always delighted to find when someone takes the time or creative effort to put a little gem in there that you may not otherwise know about. I wrote a <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/03/give-your-blog-a-name">blog post</a> about this once and I still think the blog I name in that post is still my favorite name. As for my blog's name(s), well, I have so many of them, I'm getting to scratch that naming itch!</p>
<h2>Financial question since the Web is obsessed with money: how much does it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost, or does it generate some revenue? And what's your position on people monetising personal blogs?</h2>
<p>Since I have so many blogs I'm going to break this into each platform's costs along with additional costs for related services.</p>
<h3>Weblog, 3x5.pics, Themes/Styles/Custom, Tiny Pages</h3>
<p>All six of these blogs are omg.lol addresses. A one year subscription for all the tools and goodies <a href="https://home.omg.lol/referred-by/anniegreens">omg.lol</a> offers is $20USD. Sometimes there are deals (very often, multiple times a year) and you can also gain banks of time through referrals. So although, the cost of these would normally be $120USD per year combined, I don't actually pay that much right now. I have also bought banks of time during promotional deals, so that helps as well. Each of these addresses comes with multiple tools and web presences that are infinitely configurable, so you gain quite a lot for a fairly low price. On top of that it is a lovely welcoming community run by a really nice guy, and I'm not just saying that.</p>
<h3>Microblog, 100 Days of Blog, Table for One Cafe</h3>
<p>A Micro.blog premium membership gets you up to five blogs plus a whole other host of goodies, such as podcasting, newsletter functionality, Fediverse integration, cross-posting, bookmarking, and more. The cost of the premium memership is $10USD per month. A non-premium membership with just one blog, plus cross-posting, and a few other goodies, is $5USD per month.</p>
<h3>Related Services</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://porkbun.com">Porkbun</a> handles all five of my domains. I got a deal on most of them for the first year. If all five of them were to renew at the same time at the estimated costs it would be roughly $115USD for another year.</li>
<li><a href="https://tinylytics.app">Tinylytics</a> is currently the lightweight analytics I use. There is a free tier, a monthly tier, and a yearly tier. I am currently on the yearly plan and paying $50USD per year. I am looking into moving to self-hosting Umami through PikaPods and that would be slightly more.</li>
<li><a href="https://bunny.net/cdn">Bunny.net CDN</a> is a pay-as-you-go service, so I don't have exact figures to give, but I can try to estimate. I serve all my domain's static assets, except for the Micro.blog sites which have their own storage. For March 2023 through June 2024 I paid $60-70 for the CDN + optimization on one of the storage zones, so that is less than $10USD per month at my current rate of traffic, which does vary from month-to-month.</li>
<li><a href="https://echofeed.app">EchoFeed</a> Pro (Prami's Version) is an ad hoc cross-posting service. There is a free plan that allows for one feed. The Pro plan gives you unlimited feeds and the "Prami's Version" is a small discount for omg.lol members. The creator of this service is an omg.lol member. I pay $20USD per year.</li>
<li><a href="https://letterbird.co">Letterbird</a> Pro is a contact form with customizations. The free plan has less options and no CSS customizations. I pay $10USD per month for the Pro plan. I am using it on two of my sites.</li>
<li><a href="https://flickr.com">Flickr</a> Pro is listed here because I do use Flickr hosted images quite often on my main Microblog due to the image quality and automatic resizing available, which I use to craft responsive images in some posts. Flickr Pro is $72.99USD per year with unlimited storage and full resolution.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the subject of monetization, I don't think I have any issue with it. I don't enjoy ads, but I don't mind unobtrusive methods of helping to support independent creators. I have a Buy me a coffee button on my blog at the bottom of every page. It rarely gets used, though I wouldn't mind it got used more (obviously 😆) to help support the cost of my infrastructure.</p>
<p>I think if you find value in something someone creates there is no shame in giving them some money to show appreciation and encourage them to keep it up. Many people have stressful jobs and the creative output they get via writing or doing other art and coding on their blogs may be payment enough, but they still absolutely appreciate when someone shows support monetarily. I try to give when I can, especially if I find myself going back to a person over and over for things they create to give away or for writing that has helped me.</p>
<h2>Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth checking out? And also, who do you think I should be interviewing next?</h2>
<p>This feels just as loaded as creating a blogroll! Which I took a different route in that I cannot and will not just choose a handful of people, especially since we all tend to get caught up in silos and add people that look and sound like us. My blogroll is an ever changing list that I "spin" with nine new blogs at a time when I've collected enough blogs to round out a diverse selection of bloggers and types of blogs.</p>
<p>These three suggestions come off my blogroll, any of them would be good candidates for your next interview that I would be very interested in reading.</p>
<ul>
<li>Roma Komarov: <a href="https://kizu.dev/">Articles &amp; Experiments by Roman Komarov</a> and <a href="https://blog.kizu.dev/">Roma's Unpolished Posts</a></li>
<li>Melanie Kat: <a href="https://melkat.blog/">melkat.blog</a></li>
<li>Olu Niyi-Awosusi: <a href="https://olu.online/">Olu Online</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Final question: is there anything you want to share with us?</h2>
<p>Okay, this is admittedly a smorgasbord of links, but I think they're all great. How do you choose just a handful of what the web has to offer? For me, these are things I've thought about and looked at recently. Three of these items I submitted for a <a href="https://tinyawards.net/">Tiny Award</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.igalia.com/chats/">Igalia Chats</a><br />
I really enjoy this podcast. It combines two of my most favorite front-end topics: CSS and accessibility and is co-hosted by one of the all-time most influential figures in CSS: Eric Meyer.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.oddbird.net/talks/">Oddbird past and upcoming talks &amp; workshops</a><br />
I'm always looking for new front-end content to watch or listen to. I was recently on a quest to find front-end podcasts and wasn't as successful as I hoped but I came across other resources. This Oddbird resource is really great, featuring upcoming and past talks &amp; workshops by the esteemed team at Oddbird, notably Miriam Suzanne.</li>
<li><a href="https://slashpages.net/">Slash Pages</a><br />
This is another fun project by Robb Knight. If you're just building a blog or looking for ways to add new content that isn't necessarily blog posts but still represent you and your ideas, "slash pages" are a great way to do that. I'm still on my way to achieving "slash pages totality" but I have <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/slashes">quite a selection</a> already.</li>
<li><a href="https://reply.cards/">Reply Cards</a><br />
A small project by Adam Newbold, creator of omg.lol. Reply cards are what they sound like: "Answer messages without having to write a personal response." Choose from the existing library of cards or create your own for a couple bucks and avoid that uncomfortable response you'd rather not have to make!</li>
<li><a href="https://3x5.pics">3x5.pics</a><br />
A project I recently completed but still have plans for some updates and improvements, namely accepting submissions for new entries. <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/03/creating-3x5-pics">Read a little write-up on the project</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://buttondown.email/ericwbailey/archive/">Eric Bailey's newsletter: SC 2.4.4</a><br />
You will find many newsletters to subscribe to but Eric's is one of my favorites. Somehow curating a diverse list of links to articles and information that always interest me. Some front-end, some web or tech, some unusual and bizarre, always relevant to our times, and often shocking and humbling.</li>

## Guadalcanal: 6

date: 2024-08-02, from: Ayjay blog

Around the rim of the shield Hephaestus made for Achilles is the Ocean River, the great water that (Homer believed) rings our world — Middle-earth, it’s sometimes called: the place where we live and, often enough, fight and kill and die. And, as I have noted, Guadalcanal Island is ringed by that very ocean. Guadalcanal [&#8230;]

## Play Store could soon handle updates for sideloaded applications

date: 2024-08-01, from: OS News

Android 14 introduced the ability for application stores to claim ownership over application updates, to ensure other installation sources won&#8217;t accidentally update applications they shouldn&#8217;t. What is still lacking, however, is for users to easily change the update ownership for applications. In other words, say you install an application by downloading an APK from GitHub, and later the application makes its way to F-Droid, you&#8217;ll get warning popups when F-Droid tries to update that application. That&#8217;s about to change, it seems, as Android Authority discovered that the Play Store application seems to be getting a new feature where it can take ownership of an application&#8217;s updates. A new flag spotted in the latest Google Play Store release suggests that users may see the option to install updates for apps downloaded from a different source. As you can see in the attached screenshots, the Play Store will show available updates for apps downloaded from different sources. On the app listing, you’ll also see a new “Update from Play” button that will switch the update ownership from the original source to the Play Store. ↫ Pranob Mehrotra at Android Authority Assuming this functionality is just an API other application stores can also tap into, this will be a great addition to Android for power users who use multiple application stores and want to properly manage which store updates what applications. It&#8217;s not something most people will ever really use or need, but if you&#8217;re the kind of person who does need it &#8211; it&#8217;ll become indispensable.

## “Why I prefer rST to Markdown”

date: 2024-08-01, from: OS News

This is my second book written with Sphinx, after the new Learn TLA+. Sphinx uses a peculiar markup called reStructured Text (rST), which has a steeper learning curve than markdown. I only switched to it after writing a couple of books in markdown and deciding I needed something better. So I want to talk about why rst was that something. ↫ Hillel Wayne I&#8217;ve never liked Markdown &#8211; I find it quite arbitrary and unpleasant to look at, and the fact there&#8217;s countless variants that all differ a tiny bit doesn&#8217;t help &#8211; so even though I don&#8217;t actually use Markdown for anything, I always have a passing interest in possible alternatives, if only to see what other, different, and unique ideas are out there when it comes to relatively simple markup languages. Now, I&#8217;m quite sure reStructured Text isn&#8217;t for me either, since I feel like it&#8217;s far more powerful than Markdown, and serves a different, more complex purpose. That being said, I figured I&#8217;d highlight it here since it seems it may be interesting to some of you who work on documentation for your software projects or similar endeavours.

There&#8217;s also a free version, ContextMenu Lite, that supports up to 3 actions to give you a taste of the good stuff. Submenu is optional Apply [&#8230;]

## 2024-08-01 Where to look online for RPG conversation?

date: 2024-08-01, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-08-01-where-to-look-online-for-rpg-conversation">2024-08-01 Where to look online for RPG conversation?</h1>

<p>This is a reaction to a post by the same title on the <a href="https://grumpywizard.home.blog/2024/08/01/where-to-look-online-for-rpg-conversation/">Grumpy Wizard</a> blog. I know where I get my conversation in any case. But all the points the Grumpy Wizard makes need to be considered. I don’t care about D&amp;D and Pathfinder. I don’t even care for the old editions. If at all, I care about the problems you ran into and your solutions at the table: techniques, procedures, house rules.</p>

<p>I also don’t care for product announcements or read-through reviews. I also don’t care about the details of session reports. I care about the in-between: what have you used or made for use at the table, what can you say about it, did it work, what would do differently.</p>

<p>Given these peculiarities, I find my conversation on Discord – on small servers with a dozen active people, no more, and we mostly care about the games we play with each other; or on the fediverse with an account that follows a lot of people from tabletop.social and dice.camp (or rollenspiel.social and pnpde.social, if you speak German). These sites are all a bit like early Twitter except you can follow people on compatible servers, too.</p>

<p>There are similar sites that are bit a like Reddit, but you can also follow people on other servers – but I was never very active on Reddit and so they don’t appeal much to me.</p>

<p>I guess if I were to look for forums, I’d go back to old haunts: EN World, ODD74, or whatever flavour you preferred back then.</p>

<p>Anyway, when I post stuff that got started because of something I heard or somebody I spoke to, I try to link to their social media profiles or blogs so that you can check them out and maybe follow them, too.</p>

<p>I sometimes wish there was more conversation to be found on IRC and Usenet. But that basically requires people love both role-playing games and old tech. It’s rare.</p>

<p>And then there’s what the Grumpy Wizard also said: So many thi gs have been discussed for so long, I just don’t care about the conversation anymore. Ascending or descending armour class? 6 mile hex? I no longer care.</p>

<p>I guess I’m still into blogs. 😄</p>

## Serpent OS prealpha0 released

date: 2024-08-01, from: OS News

Serpent OS, a new Linux distribution with a completely custom package management system written in Rust, has released its very very rough pre-alpha release. They&#8217;ve been working on this for four years, and they&#8217;re making some interesting choices regarding packaging that I really like, at least on paper. This will of course appear to be a very rough (crap) prealpha ISO. Underneath the surface it is using the moss package manager, our very own package management solution written in Rust. Quite simply, every single transaction in moss generates a new filesystem tree (/usr) in a staging area as a full, stateless, OS transaction. When the package installs succeed, any transaction triggers are run in a private namespace (container) before finally activating the new /usr tree. Through our enforced stateless design, usr-merge, etc, we can atomically update the running OS with a single renameat2 call. As a neat aside, all OS content is deduplicated, meaning your last system transaction is still available on disk allowing offline rollbacks. ↫ Ikey Doherty Since this is only a very rough pre-alpha release, I don&#8217;t have much more to say at this point, but I do think it&#8217;s interesting enough to let y&#8217;all know about it. Even if you&#8217;re not the kind of person to dive into pre-alphas, I think you should keep an eye on Serpent OS, because I have a feeling they&#8217;re on to something valuable here.

## The impact of AI on computer science education

date: 2024-08-01, from: OS News

Yesterday I highlighted a study that found that AI and ML, and the expectations around them, are actually causing people to need to work harder and more, instead of less. Today, I have another study for you, this time focusing a more long-term issue: when you use something like ChatGPT to troubleshoot and fix a bug, are you actually learning anything? A professor at MIT divided a group of students into three, and gave them a programming task in a language they did not know (FORTRAN). One group was allowed to use ChatGPT to solve the problem, the second group was told to use Meta’s Code Llama large language model (LLM), and the third group could only use Google. The group that used ChatGPT, predictably, solved the problem quickest, while it took the second group longer to solve it. It took the group using Google even longer, because they had to break the task down into components. Then, the students were tested on how they solved the problem from memory, and the tables turned. The ChatGPT group “remembered nothing, and they all failed,” recalled Klopfer, a professor and director of the MIT Scheller Teacher Education Program and The Education Arcade. Meanwhile, half of the Code Llama group passed the test. The group that used Google? Every student passed. ↫ Esther Shein at ACM I find this an interesting result, but at the same time, not a very surprising one. It reminds me a lot of that when I went to high school, I was part of the first generation whose math and algebra courses were built around using a graphic calculator. Despite being able to solve and graph complex equations with ease thanks to our TI-83, we were, of course, still told to include our &#8220;work&#8221;, the steps taken to get from the question to the answer, instead of only writing down the answer itself. Since I was quite good &#8220;at computers&#8221;, and even managed to do some very limited programming on the TI-83, it was an absolute breeze for me to hit some buttons and get the right answers &#8211; but since I knew, and know, absolutely nothing about math, I couldn&#8217;t for the life of me explain how I got to the answers. Using ChatGPT to fix your programming problem feels like a very similar thing. Sure, ChatGPT can spit out a workable solution for you, but since you aren&#8217;t aware of the steps between problem and solution, you aren&#8217;t actually learning anything. By using ChatGPT, you&#8217;re not actually learning how to program or how to improve your skills &#8211; you&#8217;re just hitting the right buttons on a graphing calculator and writing down what&#8217;s on the screen, without understanding why or how. I can totally see how using ChatGPT for boring boilerplate code you&#8217;ve written a million times over, or to point you in the right direction while still coming up with your own solution to a problem, can be a good and helpful thing. I&#8217;m just worried about a degradation in skill level and code quality, and how society will, at some point, pay the price for that.

<p>Apparently (I have not seen whatever he saw), some town in Canada is trying to deter polar bears from entering the town by capturing them, depriving them of food and subjecting them to “shock therapy” for two months, before releasing them back into the wild? Like, what kind of scheme is this. &ldquo;Oh no no, we can&rsquo;t <em>kill</em> the polar bears, so we&rsquo;re just going to lock them up for two months and torture them, before dropping them off right back where there&rsquo;s still no food.&rdquo; And Viv is raging, insisting that the mining companies should be required to deposit truckloads of seals in the area where the polar bears are so they have something to eat, and I&rsquo;m like&hellip; I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the crux of the issue here. Anyway, idk, it made me laugh (even though it sucks for the polar bears). Very Canadian things.</p>

## The NYT is weird

date: 2024-07-31, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Someone in charge at the NYT needs to take a step back and view events, and the NYT role in those events, from the point of view of an ordinary non-NYT-employed citizen, bewildered at the enormous risks journalists are taking with the system of government of the United States. </p>
<p>In the context of who we are as a country, what the Repubs do and say is to be very mild about it "weird." What word would you prefer the Democrats use? Imagine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Safire">William Safire</a> were here, the great linguist columnist of the NYT, wrote that column. (Safire was a <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/ab14f5b9-2b55-406f-9b78-057313c03d63">Republican</a> btw.)</p>
<p>And to the Democrats, no matter what the NYT says, keep using the term. This is where you get to speak out about what they're doing over there, and how it's not journalism. One of the rare things you agree with Trump on. </p>
<p>Podcast: <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/31/theNYTIsWeird.m4a">3 minutes</a>.</p>
<p>PS: Safire went to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronx_High_School_of_Science">Bronx Science</a>! I did not know that. (So did I.) I love the idea of writers who aren't scared of tech stuff. </p>
<p>PPS: Even Richard Nixon would think today's so-called Republicans were weird. </p>
<p>PPPS: The NYT is totally unmoored, a word I bet Safire would like. </p>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-07-31, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

People who get their sense of self-esteem from having procreated are placing a heavy burden on their children. What if the child doesn't live up to their expectations? How will they treat the child then! Creating a new human is not an accomplishment. Treating that new life as a full person starting at birth, and through their whole life, <i>that's</i> an accomplishment. For a man to father a child just means they have a functioning reproductive system. It's not anything to be proud or to expect to be rewarded or respected for.

## AI causing burnout, lower productivity

date: 2024-07-31, from: OS News

Is machine learning, also known as &#8220;artificial intelligence&#8221;, really aiding workers and increasing productivity? A study by Upwork &#8211; which, as Baldur Bjarnason so helpfully points out, sells AI solutions and hence did not promote this study on its blog as it does with its other studies &#8211; reveals that this might not actually be the case. Nearly half (47%) of workers using AI say they have no idea how to achieve the productivity gains their employers expect. Over three in four (77%) say AI tools have decreased their productivity and added to their workload in at least one way. For example, survey respondents reported that they’re spending more time reviewing or moderating AI-generated content (39%), invest more time learning to use these tools (23%), and are now being asked to do more work (21%). Forty percent of employees feel their company is asking too much of them when it comes to AI. ↫ Upwork research This shouldn&#8217;t come as a surprise. We&#8217;re in a massive hype cycle when it comes to machine learning, and we&#8217;re being told it&#8217;s going to revolutionise work and lead to massive productivity gains. In practice, however, it seems these tools just can&#8217;t measure up to the hyped promises, and in fact is making people do less and work slower. There&#8217;s countless stories of managers being told by upper management to shove machine learning into everything, from products to employee workflows, whether it makes any sense to do so or not. I know from experience as a translator that machine learning can greatly improve my productivity, but the fact that there are certain types of tasks that benefit from ML, doesn&#8217;t mean every job suddenly thrives with it. I&#8217;m definitely starting to see some cracks in the hype cycle, and this study highlights a major one. I hope we can all come down to earth again, and really take a careful look at where ML makes sense and where it does not, instead of giving every worker a ChatGPT account and blanket demanding massive productivity gains that in no way match the reality on the office floor. And of course, despite demanding massive productivity increases, it&#8217;s not like workers are getting an equivalent increase in salary. We&#8217;ve seen massive productivity increases for decades now, while paychecks have not followed suit at all, and many people can actually buy less with their salary today than their parents could decades ago. Demands imposed by managers by introducing AI is only going to make this discrepancy even worse.

## Logitech has an idea for a “forever mouse” that requires a subscription

date: 2024-07-31, from: OS News

Logitech CEO Hanneke Faber talked about someting called the &#8220;forever mouse&#8221;, which would be, as the name implies, a mouse that customers could use for a very long time. While you may think this would mean an incredibly well-built mouse, or one that can be easily repaired, which Logitech already makes somewhat possible through a partnership with iFixIt, another option the company is thinking about is a subscription model. Yes. Faber said subscription software updates would mean that people wouldn&#8217;t need to worry about their mouse. The business model is similar to what Logitech already does with video conferencing services (Logitech&#8217;s B2B business includes Logitech Select, a subscription service offering things like apps, 24/7 support, and advanced RMA). Having to pay a regular fee for full use of a peripheral could deter customers, though. HP is trying a similar idea with rentable printers that require a monthly fee. The printers differ from the idea of the forever mouse in that the HP hardware belongs to HP, not the user. However, concerns around tracking and the addition of ongoing expenses are similar. ↫ Scharon Harding at Ars Technica Now, buying a mouse whose terrible software requires subscription models would still be a choice you can avoid, but my main immediately conjured up a far darker scenario. PC makers have a long history of adding crapware to their machines in return for payments from the producers of said crapware. I can totally see what&#8217;s going to happen next. You buy a brand new laptop, unbox it at home, and turn it on. Before you know it, a dialog pops up right after he crappy Windows out-of-box experience asking you to subscribe to your laptop&#8217;s touchpad software in order to unlock its more advanced features like gestures. But why stop there? The keyboard of that new laptop has RGB backlighting, but if you want to change its settings, you&#8217;re going to have to pay for another subscription. Your laptop&#8217;s display has additional features and modes for specific types of content and more settings sliders, but you&#8217;ll have to pay up to unlock them. And so on. I&#8217;m not saying this will happen, but I&#8217;m also not saying it won&#8217;t. I&#8217;m sorry for birthing this idea into the world.

## Less Coffee, Better Sleep

date: 2024-07-31, from: Marginallia log

As an experiment, I&rsquo;ve reduced my coffee-intake to a single cup a day for about a week now. It&rsquo;s made an enormous difference in sleep, mood and energy. I get tired at night, fall asleep quickly, and wake up refreshed.
As mentioned previously in the context of morning sunlight exposure&mdash;another thing that&rsquo;s aided my sleeping habits, but is somewhat less practical to sustain as it requires fair weather&mdash;I&rsquo;ve always been slow to get going in the morning, active at night, bad at getting to bed at sane hours.

## pg_ivm 1.9 released

date: 2024-07-31, from: PostgreSQL News

<p>IVM Development Group is pleased to announce the release of <a href="https://github.com/sraoss/pg_ivm/releases/tag/v1.9">pg_ivm 1.9</a>.</p>
<p>Changes since the v1.8 release include:</p>
<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Add support for PostgreSQL 17 (Yugo Nagata, Takuma Hoshiai, reshke)</p>
<p>This contains the following changes:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change functions to use a safe search_path during maintenance operations when used with PostgreSQL 17</p>
<p>This prevents maintenance operations (automatic maintenance of IMMVs and refresh_immv) from performing
unsafe access. Functions used by IMMVs that need to reference non-default schemas must specify a search
path during function creation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>refresh_immv can be executed by users with the MAINTAIN privilege when used with PostgreSQL 17</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>About pg_ivm</h3>
<p>pg_ivm is an extension module that provides Incremental View Maintenance (IVM) feature.</p>
<p>Incremental View Maintenance (IVM) is a way to make materialized views up-to-date in
which only incremental changes are computed and applied on views rather than recomputing. 
pg_ivm provides a kind of immediate maintenance, in which materialized views are updated
immediately after a base table is modified.</p>

Here's I'm learning to reconstruct the summer of 2004, one of the most creative periods of my life, at least that's viewable in such a public and preserved way. Am I the first to do this for any blog? If you know of an example of historic research done using the archive of a blog, please send me a note. I'd love to learn about what you learned! Also because of its longevity and continuity, I offer <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/25.html">this blog</a> as some kind of record of what happened in the last 30 years or so.

## Childless vs childful

date: 2024-07-30, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Notes accumulated during the day -- not in any particular order. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span></p>
<p>I keep a solid line between my personal life and blogging, learned the hard way. When I started blogging in 1994, I didn't have such a solid line, and found that I couldn't have a personal life if I made it public. But now I want to reveal something. I am "childless" which is a term I find pretty insulting, as if being child<i>ful</i> is the only normal state of being. </p>
<p>I find, in general childful people are not great friends or family members. They want special privileges and they often get them. If childful vs childless is going to be an issue in this campaign, I say -- bring it on. We should have this discussion. </p>
<p>I'm often tempted to offer advice to the parents, but I won't offer it unless asked, except this. If you have children, there's a good chance one or more of them will not have children, and you should love them the same, and provide models of acceptance while they're growing up, by bringing childless people into your home, so the kids know that this is one of the legitimate choices in life, offering proof that you won't love them any less if they go down that path. And here's the hard part, imho, for people with children -- <i>keep that promise. </i></p>
<p>BTW, people say it's seflish to not have children, but I don't agree, in fact I think it's the opposite. There was a point in human evolution where the struggle to survive for our species was fed by procreation, but some time in the last hundred years we crossed a line, where increasing human population worked against species survival. Our understanding of the meaning of procreating, like so much else about our civilization, has not yet caught up with the current reality. </p>

## Fixing curl install failures with Ansible on Red Hat-derivative OSes

<span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Fixing curl install failures with Ansible on Red Hat-derivative OSes</span>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Over the past few months, I've noticed some of my automation failing on Red Hat-derivative OSes like Rocky Linux and AlmaLinux. The reason for this has to do with the inclusion of a <code>curl-minimal</code> package in some distros, which conflicts with <code>curl</code> if you try installing the full package.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the fix for this is a little strange, and so only ends up in Ansible's <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/dnf_module.html">dnf</a> module, not in the more cross-compatible <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/package_module.html">package</a> module.</p>

## Hacking Pi firmware to get the fastest overclock

<span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Hacking Pi firmware to get the fastest overclock</span>

<p>Since boosting my Pi 5 from the default 2.4 GHz clock to <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/raspberry-pi-5-can-overclock-314-ghz">3.14 GHz on Pi Day</a>, I've wanted to go faster. Especially since many other users have topped my Geekbench scores since then :)</p>

<p>In March, Raspberry Pi introduced new firmware that unlocked frequencies above 3,000 MHz for overclocking. This summer, <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/numa-emulation-speeds-pi-5-and-other-improvements">NUMA Emulation patches</a> boosted performance another 5-10% through memory access optimizations.</p>

<p>But even with a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/overclocking/comments/3d1y4j/comment/ct1sk4e/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">golden sample</a> Pi 5, I haven't seen anybody go much beyond 3.1 or 3.2 GHz. The problem seemed to be power supply—the Pi's firmware limits the SoC to a maximum of 1.000V.</p></div>

Please, let that be the last time we do that. I felt like it might as well have been <i>Slave Owners for Harris</i> or <i>Reformed Republicans for Harris.</i> I don't have anything against people of my gender and approximate race, but I also am a child of Holocaust survivors, and I happen to be one of the elites the Repubs claim to hate, and also am one of at least two castes that Democrats tend to blame for all our problems (other than White Dudes). I think we've done enough segregation for one campaign, now please please I beg you, let's <i>work together,</i> regardless of labels, to save the country we all love. I have a philosophy, I don't care how you got to the party, if you took a subway, walked, rode a bike, or came by Uber or a Cadillac limousine. We all got here, and have a common purpose, so lets all love each other and party our way to victory. Regardless of race, creed, color or whatever.

I bought an iPhone that I now don't need, and it's arriving today via FedEx. I wanted to know whether I should just refuse delivery, or accept it and then return it. Obviously it's easier for me to refuse. I asked ChatGPT and it gave me a detailed reply. Apple's chatbot saw it as a "technical" question and wasn't prepared to help. Sales support is one of those applications where cost is totally justified. A human helper would cost a lot more I imagine than a LLM chat system. I tried calling 1-800-CALL-APPLE and talked to a human who was very nice, but couldn't find anything in her manual about refusing delivery.

## Thoughts on politics and communities

date: 2024-07-29, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>Kev has written about the topic of <a href="https://kevquirk.com/blog/politics-and-communities">politics and communities</a> on his blog and it was related to his recently announced <a href="https://kevquirk.com/blog/introducing-500-social">500.social</a> project. In his post, he mentioned blog posts written by <a href="https://baty.net">Jack</a> and <a href="https://nice-marmot.net">Dave</a>. If you’re interested in the full discussion go read the various blog posts, they’re all relatively short.</p>
<p>I’m not interested in commenting on the opinions expressed in those blog posts but I am interested in the source of the discussion, and that was a bullet list item in the 500.social <a href="https://about.500.social/#expectations">“Member expectations” section</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Posts about politics and religion should be avoided, if you strongly feel the urge to post about these topics, please put them behind a Content Warning Member expectations</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Years ago, during the COVID era, the 37signals company got into hot water online because they announced in an internal communication that they were going to ban “societal and political discussions” on their internal work chat. <a href="https://world.hey.com/jason/changes-at-basecamp-7f32afc5">The announcement is online</a> if you’re interested in reading it.</p>
<p>People online reacted in all sorts of ways to that news and many, many opinion pieces got published. I remember talking about it with a few people privately and had some interesting conversations around that topic. As you can see, years later, positions on topics such as politics and religion are still controversial in the context of online spaces.</p>
<p>Personally, I think the issue is not with politics, religion or any other topic. The problem is a mixture of expectations and the tools we use. In his post, Dave wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If there is a "public square" anymore, where we ought to be able to try to hash those things out, it seems to me that it's in those "small social networks," unless they're intended to be bespoke bubbles where it's all just happy talk and we never have difficult conversations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t disagree that small communities are the space where those conversations can happen which is why I think no topic should be banned or be off limits. At the same time though, I do think that having conversations means something very different than posting a reactionary tweet to comment on a piece of news. That’s why people like Kev end up with rules against politics and religion. Because if you dig deeper, people don’t want to have a conversation on social media. They want to vent.</p>
<p>I think social media platforms, like Mastodon, are not designed to have conversations. You can have them on there, sure, but the experience is going to be sub-par. Social media is designed to be reactionary and generating reactions is different than having a conversation. What would Mastodon look like if everyone was forced to post at least 500 words? What would Mastodon look like if you could only post once an hour? The reason why some people, like Kev, end up with rules like that is because social media is an imperfect tool. I don’t have a no politics rule attached to my email address. People can write to me and talk about whatever they want. If they write about something I don’t care about I can simply ignore that topic and don’t engage in conversation which is exactly what happens in real life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What prompted me to consider joining 500.social was recalling the feeling I had when we learned that Biden had dropped out of the race. That's the sort of event that evokes an immediate, emotional response because of its significance to a broad range of people, presumably my "community."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the perfect example of why I think social media is a flawed tool. Can you imagine doing the same in the phone era? Can you imagine reading a piece of news and start calling hundreds, potentially thousands of people simply to share what you think about some news? And can you imagine doing that with people who don’t even live in your country and couldn’t care less about that specific news? Now can you imagine if everyone was doing the same for the news that evoked a strong reaction to them? You’d quickly put your phone on airplane mode because there are only so many random opinions on news you can bear to listen to. I can have a 3 hours discussion about politics, I can’t listen 3 hours of soundbites.</p>
<p>The problem with social media and politics is that way too many people are interested in sharing what they think on social media but very few are interested in having actual, real discussions. Because blasting out a tweet takes 10 seconds while having an actual conversation might take hours and span days.</p>
<p>I’d love to know what you think about this whole situation though. Do you think some topics should be banned on social platforms? If you have opinions get in touch or even better write a blog post!</p>                <hr>

## NASA, JAXA Bounce Laser Beam Between Moon’s Surface and Lunar Orbit

NASA’s LRO (Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter) has twice transmitted a laser pulse to a cookie-sized retroreflector aboard JAXA’s (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) SLIM lander on the Moon and received a return signal. As LRO passed 44 miles above SLIM (Smart Lander for Investigating Moon) during two successive orbits on May 24, 2024, it pinged the lander […]

## Microsoft’s CrowdStrike post-mortem

date: 2024-07-29, from: OS News

Microsoft has published a post-mortem of the CrowdStrike incident, and goes into great depths to describe where, exactly, the error lies, and how it could lead to such massive problems. I can&#8217;t comment anything insightful on the technical details and code they show to illustrate all of this &#8211; I&#8217;ll leave that discussion up to you &#8211; but Microsoft also spends considerable amount of time explaining why security vendors are choosing to use kernel-mode drivers. Microsoft lists three major reasons why security vendors opt for using kernel modules, and none of them will come as a great surprise to OSNews readers: kernel drivers provide more visibility into the system than a userspace tool would, there are performance benefits, and they&#8217;re more resistant to tampering. The downsides are legion, too, of course, as any crash or similar issue in kernel mode has far-reaching consequences. The goal, then, according to Microsoft, is to balance the need for greater insight, performance, and tamper resistance with stability. And while the company doesn&#8217;t say it directly, this is clearly where CrowdStrike failed &#8211; and failed hard. While you would want a security tool like CrowdStrike to perform as little as possible in kernelspace, and conversely as much as possible in userspace, that&#8217;s not what CrowdStrike did. They are running a lot of stuff in kernelspace that really shouldn&#8217;t be there, such as the update mechanism and related tools. In total, CrowdStrike loads four kernel drivers, and much of their functionality can be run in userspace instead. It is possible today for security tools to balance security and reliability. For example, security vendors can use minimal sensors that run in kernel mode for data collection and enforcement limiting exposure to availability issues. The remainder of the key product functionality includes managing updates, parsing content, and other operations can occur isolated within user mode where recoverability is possible. This demonstrates the best practice of minimizing kernel usage while still maintaining a robust security posture and strong visibility. Windows provides several user mode protection approaches for anti-tampering, like Virtualization-based security (VBS) Enclaves and Protected Processes that vendors can use to protect their key security processes. Windows also provides ETW events and user-mode interfaces like Antimalware Scan Interface for event visibility. These robust mechanisms can be used to reduce the amount of kernel code needed to create a security solution, which balances security and robustness. ↫ David Weston, Vice President, Enterprise and OS Security at Microsoft In what is surely an unprecedented event, I agree with the CrowdStrike criticism bubbling under the surface of this post-mortem by Microsoft. Everything seems to point towards CrowdStrike stuffing way more things in kernelspace than is needed, and as such creating a far larger surface for things to go catastrophically wrong than needed. While Microsoft obviously isn&#8217;t going to openly and publicly throw CrowdStrike under the bus, it&#8217;s very clear what they&#8217;re hinting at here, and this is about as close to a public flogging we&#8217;re going to get. Microsoft&#8217;s post-portem further details a ton of work Microsoft has recently done, is doing, and will soon be doing to further strenghthen Windows&#8217; security, to lessen the need for kernelspace security drivers even more, including adding support for Rust to the Windows kernel, which should also aid in mitigating some common problems present in other, older programming languages (while not being a silver bullet either, of course).

## 2024-07-27 Tired of programming

date: 2024-07-29, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-07-27-tired-of-programming">2024-07-27 Tired of programming</h1>

<p>My summer break has begun, and I am tired.</p>

<p>I wanted to work on some sort of editor.
I contributed some lines to Anvil, an Acme-inspired editor, and then I figured I should go back to text editing because writing acceptable GUI editing is just sooo much effort. So now I’m trying to use ed again…
I&rsquo;m experimenting with using <code>rlwrap</code> around <code>ed</code> and it&rsquo;s not so bad if you&rsquo;re just writing, like writing an email.
But really writing, organizing, moving things around… it really doesn&rsquo;t work all that well.
I had imagined a sort of conversational UI – which I guess ed has? – if ed is your grumpiest of companions! – and I guess I was looking at my Oddmu site generator and Markdown file server and thinking: what sort of editor would I need to maintain this?
What sort of minimal SVG editing capabilities would be nice to have? That was my starting point.
Then I dropped the graphics because writing that seemed like a pain.
Then I started thinking about the GUI components: using fonts with Harfbuzz, Unicode support, hyphenation (per language), spell-checking (per language), and on and on.
It&rsquo;s too much.</p>

<p>But where does that leave me? Adding a few features to ed?
Am I in fact reinventing vi, badly?</p>

<p><a href="2024-06-01-editor">2024-06-01 Fonts are important</a>,
<a href="2024-06-13-anvil">2024-06-13 Anvil Editor and multiple cursors</a>,
<a href="2024-07-24-ed">2024-07-24 My ed, wondering</a></p>

<p>I wanted to work on a local Gridmapper variant, written in Common Lisp.
I already have a working prototype in Common Lisp and I already have a Javascript web application in production.
This is a single file, a stand-alone SVG+Javascript web application. It works online and offline.
Thus, my entire tinkering with CL right now has as its goal to produce a native application that would work without a browser.</p>

<p>Whenever I start working on native GUI stuff, like working with SDL2 or Cairo or similar libraries, my eyes start bleeding.
Vanilla JS and the browser really is a pretty nice virtual machine available to many of us.
Having spent a day trying to get SDL2, SDL2 gfx and Cairo sorted out for this Common Lisp app I&rsquo;m looking at really makes me want to drop it all for another two years and focus on JavaScript instead.
It can&rsquo;t be that bad! Javascript gives me the DOM and SVG and all that, practically for free…</p>

<p>And three different bindings Common Lisp bindings for SDL2 in various states of neglect is draining.
Switching from one to the other is tricky since the first one had many idiomatic helpers functions that the other is lacking.
But the first one is lacking a gfx port.
Then again, I guess I can add circle drawing using lines.</p>

<p>Everything takes so long. So damn long.</p>

<p><a href="2022-07-20_Gridmapper_CL">2022-07-20 Gridmapper CL 5</a>, <a href="2024-07-24-gridmapper-local">2024-07-24 Gridmapper Local</a></p>

<p>A while ago I started collecting links with quotes instead of relying on browser bookmarks or third parties. I remember at one point my bookmarks were just HTML files generated by the browser. Good times! And there was Delicious, a service now defunct, I guess. So now I keep <a href="Bookmarks">bookmarks on this site</a>. It&rsquo;s great.</p>

<p>I wondered whether I should write a tool that monitors those pages, and when new items get added, a feed is updated.
Just a little program… it doesn&rsquo;t seem hard. So I gave it try.  I like documentation first, these days so I began with a man page for it. Good, good. Then I though that perhaps I should use the same Markdown parser as Oddmu uses.
So I needed to write this tool in Go. How hard can it be?
It&rsquo;s a bit harder than writing it in Perl.
Oh, and I needed to parse the RSS file, too.
Or use SQLite to store data.
It keeps getting harder.</p>

<p>Well, I spent some time on it and now I&rsquo;m tired again.
This too, takes too long!</p>

<p>I feel defeated. Am I too impatient?</p>

<p>I should read a book.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Programming">#Programming</a></p>

<p><strong>2024-07-27</strong>. In an attempt to overcome my sadness, I decided to spice up my shell life…</p>

<pre><code># hipster shell
alias ls='echo Using exa instead;exa'
alias du='echo Using dust instead;dust'
alias top='echo Using htop instead;htop'
alias find='echo Using fd instead;fd'
alias grep='echo Using rg instead;rg'
alias files='echo Using yazi instead;yazi'
alias cal='echo Using khal instead;khal'
alias screenshot='grimshot'
alias copy='wl-copy'
alias paste='wl-paste'
</code></pre>

<p>I set up <code>khal</code> and <code>khard</code> which required me to set up <code>vdirsyncer</code> to sync the remote calendars (and contacts) to local copies. This is also good for backup, I guess.</p>

<p>Let me know if you know of other such tools.</p>

<p><strong>2024-07-29</strong>. I overcame my block and wrote the bookmarks-to-feed program in Perl: <a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/bookmark-feed.git">bookmark-feed</a>. 🔖 🤝 <img loading="lazy" src="/pics/rss.svg" alt="RSS" /></p>

<p>I installed a daily cron job:</p>

<pre><code>47  23  *  *   *     /usr/bin/nice /home/alex/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.40.0/bin/bookmark-feed /home/alex/alexschroeder.ch/wiki/*_Bookmarks.md /home/alex/alexschroeder.ch/wiki/*-bookmarks.md /home/alex/alexschroeder.ch/wiki/bookmarks.rss
</code></pre>

<p>The readable variant is this: <code>bookmark-feed markdown-files… feed-file</code>.
The files it looks at once a day are my <a href="Bookmarks">Bookmarks</a>.
The feed it generates is <a href="/wiki/bookmarks.rss">bookmarks.rss</a>.
The database it uses is <a href="/wiki/bookmarks.db">bookmarks.db</a>.</p>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t do expiration from the database but uses only the last 40 items for the feed.</p>

<p>When populating the database, all I had was the timestamp of the Markdown pages, so the existing bookmarks are all relatively unsorted – they are sorted by the timestamp of the most recent addition to the whole category, which pretty weird.</p>

## NotMyFault: Microsoft’s tool to create BSoDs

date: 2024-07-28, from: OS News

Blue screens of death are not exactly in short supply on Windows machines lately, but what if you really want to cause your own kernel panic or complete system crash, just because you love that shade of crashy blue? Well, there&#8217;s a tool for that called NotMyFault, developed by Mark Russinovich as part of Sysinternals. NotMyFault is a tool that you can use to crash, hang, and cause kernel memory leaks on your Windows system. It’s useful for learning how to identify and diagnose device driver and hardware problems, and you can also use it to generate blue screen dump files on misbehaving systems. The download file includes 32-bit and 64-bit versions, as well as a command-line version that works on Nano Server. Chapter 7 in Windows Internals uses NotMyFault to demonstrate pool leak troubleshooting and Chapter 14 uses it for crash analysis examples. ↫ Mark Russinovich Using this tool, you can select exactly what kind of crash you want to cause, and after clicking the Crash button, your Windows computer will do exactly as it&#8217;s told and crash with a lovely blue screen of death. It comes in both a GUI and CLI version, and the latter also works on minimal Windows installations that don&#8217;t have the Windows shell installed. A tool like this may seem odd, but it can be particularly useful in situations where you&#8217;re trying to troubleshoot an issue, and to learn how to properly diagnose crashes. Or, you know, you can use it to create a panic at your workplace.

## Managarm: microkernel-based OS with fully asynchronous I/O

date: 2024-07-28, from: OS News

Ah, another microkernel-based hobby operating system. The more, the merrier &#8211; and I mean this, without a hint of sarcasm. There&#8217;s definitely been a small resurgence in activity lately when it comes to small hobby and teaching operating systems, some of which are exploring some truly new ideas, and I&#8217;m definitely here for it. Today we have managarm. Some notable properties of managarm are: (i) managarm is based on a microkernel while common Desktop operating systems like Linux and Windows use monolithic kernels, (ii) managarm uses a completely asynchronous API for I/O and (iii) despite those internal differences, managarm provides good compatibility with Linux at the user space level. ↫ managarm GitHub page It&#8217;s a 64bit operating system with SMP support, an ACPI implementation, networking, USB3 support, and, as the quoted blurb details, a lot of support for Linux and POSIX. It can already run Weston, kmscon, and other things like Bash, the GNU Coreutils, and more. While not explicitly mentioned, I assume the best platform to run managarm on are most likely virtualisation tools, and there&#8217;s a detailed handbook to help you along during building and using this new operating system.

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/07/26/oldTwitterLogo.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Before Twitter broke the API, it was a quick way for me to channel items from my blog to almost all the people who follow me on the social web. Now it isn't even one of the services I use that I can post to with my writing tool (those are Bluesky, Mastodon, WordPress). None of them are anything like the aggregator of people that Twitter was, and I can't even reach it from my writing tool. I really want to solve this problem, but I absolutely can't do this on my own. No time, patience, and it's not my job to do all that coding. As observed the other day, my time should be spent on writing tools for the web and directly related products. This is the kind of project that should be handled as an open source thing.

Barath Raghavan and Bruce Schneier: The [CrowdStrike] catastrophe is yet another reminder of how brittle global internet infrastructure is. […] This brittleness is a result of market incentives. In enterprise computing — as opposed to personal computing — a company that provides computing infrastructure to enterprise networks is incentivized to be as integral as possible, [&#8230;]

Why the single version of the cassette didn’t feel as worthy of a purchase as, say, a 45. Or, perhaps, even a digital download.
