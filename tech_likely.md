Terry Teachout and the Last of the Conservative Critics &#124; The Nation: But Teachout, whose natural inclination was toward equanimity and collegiality, perhaps never fully confronted the politics of his conservative peers. Unlike Didion and Wills, Teachout never stopped writing for National Review. His review of a biography of Graham Greene ran in the magazine [&#8230;]

## Grounded cognition: physical activities and learning computing

date: 2024-02-06, from: Raspberry Pi (.org)

<p>Everyone who has taught children before will know the excited gleam in their eyes when the lessons include something to interact with physically. Whether it’s printed and painstakingly laminated flashcards, laser-cut models, or robots, learners’ motivation to engage with the topic will increase along with the noise levels in the classroom. However, these hands-on activities&#8230;</p>

## CoraQuest

date: 2024-02-06, from: Dave Rupert blog

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kjwjyRAxGGw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p><a href="https://www.coraquest.com/">CoraQuest</a> is a “family cooperative dungeon crawler” created by adorable dad-daughter duo Dan and Cora Hughes from Huddersfield, UK. Feeling the boredom of pandemic lockdown, Dan and Cora (8yo) decided to design a board game and <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cabbagedan/coraquest/description">put it on Kickstarter</a>. I’ve wanted an easy “Dungeons and Dragons for Kids” game for a long time and this hits all the marks. It’s imaginative, tactile, visual, and it has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzLi8IWmLKU">a simple ruleset</a> that kids can easily grok. I backed it the minute I saw it.</p>
<p>CoraQuest comes with ~9 or so premade adventures so parents can run a one-shot without much preparation. The dungeon is a stack of 9x9 tiles with special story cards mixed in that map to story beats in the premade adventure. I embellish a bit and give the bad guys names like “Gerald” and “Geoffrey”. Add some funny voices and it’s a guaranteed good time for kids. My son and his friends played for two hours the other day and the kids didn’t even think about devices. That is worth the price of admission alone.</p>
<p>There’s other aspects that make this game great like how you can upload drawings to <a href="https://www.coraquest.com/cc/creator.html">design your own heroes and enemies</a>, there’s <a href="https://www.coraquest.com/hoodez-hidden-door/">narrated quests</a> to offload that responsibility, but to me the best part is my kids love it and ask for it. The infectious laughter of Dan and Cora has infected our house and young Cora is a role model that I often point to and tell my kids they can make a cool game everyone loves if you set your mind to it. I love the game so much I’ve <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cabbagedan/coraquest-keep-on-questing-expansion/description">bought the expansion</a> as well as a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CK9WNG57">short story book</a> that takes place in the CoraQuest fantasy universe.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a game to play with your kids and their friends, I highly recommend CoraQuest.</p>

## What is Dark Energy? Inside our accelerating, expanding Universe

date: 2024-02-05, from: NASA breaking news

Some 13.8 billion years ago, the universe began with a rapid expansion we call the big bang. After this initial expansion, which lasted a fraction of a second, gravity started to slow the universe down. But the cosmos wouldn’t stay this way. Nine billion years after the universe began, its expansion started to speed up, […]

## Well-known secrets of AmigaDOS

date: 2024-02-05, from: OS News

In keeping with the Commodore tradition of cost cutting, most consumer models of their Amiga line of computers came with severely watered down documentation. The Amiga 500 was an exception from this rule, but owners of later machines &#8211; such as the A1200 &#8211; may not have gotten any documentation for the command line part of AmigaOS at all. And, of course, even if this documentation had shipped with the machines, it wouldn&#8217;t have revealed features that were hidden to anyone without access to official developer documentation or even left completely undocumented or unfinished. This is a quick look at a few of these interesting features, some more obscure than others, but all of them decidedly useful. Most of them only apply to versions 2.x and/or 3.x of the OS. With that said, let&#8217;s dive right in! ↫ Carl Svensson Exactly what it says on the tin.

## Microsoft sneaks ads into the new Outlook for Windows

date: 2024-02-05, from: OS News

The migration from the classic Mail and Calendar app to the new Outlook app is in full swing already. Microsoft announced the deprecation of the classic apps in favor of a new Outlook app in June 2023. It introduced the new Outlook app to Insider builds a month later and announced that it would enforce the migration in early 2024. Not all users are migrated at this point. Those who have been migrated already or installed the Outlook app directly, may notice several differences between the new Outlook app and the classic Mail app. One of the main differences turns an ad-free email experience into one with ads. You may see ads in the inbox in the new Outlook. ↫ Martin Brinkmann Ads disguised as emails in your inbox. Microsoft will not rest until Windows resembles Times Square. What a trash fire of an operating system.

## T? and Optional<T> Are Not the Same in Swift

date: 2024-02-05, from: Michael Tsai

Nick Lockwood: I once again got bitten by the fact that T? properties in a Swift struct become optional parameters in the synthesized initializer, making it easy to accidentally omit a property that you meant to set. The workaround is either to use let instead of var, or to use Optional&#60;T&#62; instead of T? Swift [&#8230;]

## A holy communion

date: 2024-02-05, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>You and I are partaking in something magical.</p>
<p>The electric meat inside my cranium told my fingers to punch mechanical keys to send signals through an electric rock and encode these thoughts on a magnetic rock. Then through radio waves, beacons, and wires I create a copy of this magnetically encoded text on another rock in another town, in another state. That rock copies itself to another town (possibly in another country) closer to you. Then through another relay of wires and radio waves that text replicates itself on the electric rock in your palm. Your rock renders those words with light through stained glass. You read rendered words and glyphs and the electric meat in your own head decodes the text.</p>
<p>Our thoughts, words, and images transfigured through time and space as ones and zeroes. Circumnavigating the globe in milliseconds. An immaculate relay. A holy exchange.</p>
<p>That is powerful. It is precious. We would do well to preserve its sanctity.</p>

## 2024-02-03 Wieder im Wallis

<p>The next day we went running but it was so steep that we rarely did run. It was more of a speed hike. 😅</p>

## What Your Brain Is Doing When You’re Not Doing Anything

If you're creating something new, definitely create it on feedland.com. If you're already using feedland.org, for now you're welcome to continue, but in the back of your mind think about creating a new account on Com and importing your subscription list. Org is proving useful to have around, so I don't imagine it'll go away, it's much easier for me to work on a DO server than on the big cloud-based server.

feedland.org runs on a small <a href="https://cloud.digitalocean.com/droplets/new">Digital Ocean server</a>, and Com runs in a data center. The first is a fixed-size relatively small scale server that can't expand, and the latter is designed to scale automatically according to demand. I spent most of 2023 converting the software to run in the scalable environment.

BTW, while we're doing this transition in FeedLand, I also have a small crisis happening on my main static server, which depends on a combination of software that suddenly aren't getting along with each other. Obviously something changed. I'm running it in a somewhat crippled state, I may be figuring how to dig out of this hole. One of the downsides of having fun with server software.

Hang in there, you’ll see what I mean.  Recently some people — including grifters, but also a few people who want to have a reputation for responsible thinking and writing — have been promoting a re-interpretation of the death of George Floyd, an [&#8230;]

**@Tomosino's Mastodon feed** (date: 2024-02-05, from: Tomosino's Mastodon feed)

<p>Seeing some of the apple headsets on social media and I'm struggling to decide if my automatic reactions are genuine, fair, and kind. My first thoughts are quite negative. Is it because I have a prejudice against Apple? Or against augmented reality it whatever new term is getting pushed? Does it look ridiculous because I'm judging people against a deep seeded set of cultural norms I should be questioning? I'm really not sure.</p>

## Routines

date: 2024-02-05, from: Manu - I write blog

<p>They say the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. I found the inverse of that to also be true for my life. Doing things differently day after day and expecting the same–positive–outcome.</p>
<p>I’m the product of two terrible traits: I’m a morning person but I also lack self-discipline. And that means keeping a morning routine is incredibly hard for me. And yet, every time I manage to do that I feel really well. My mind is in a much better place when I wake up at 6 am or even 5 am. I feel a lot better when I’m out in nature with the sun rising. I know it. I’m aware of all this. And yet keeping a morning routine is incredibly hard. I’m getting better at it though so I’m pleased with that.</p>
<p>Learning how my mind works is a fun process. You’re tempted to think you just know yourself and yet there’s always a new discovery waiting behind the corner. Thankfully I have my whole life to figure this stuff out.</p>

## Why NetNewsWire Isn’t Available for Vision Pro

date: 2024-02-05, from: Innessential (Brint Simmons' blog)

<p>I’ve been getting questions about NetNewsWire’s unavailability on Vision Pro. Why isn’t it there? When might it be there?</p>

<p>Here’s the scoop:</p>

<p>I consider it risky to support an app running on a device I don’t own. Imagine writing a Mac or iPhone app and not actually running it on one of those machines — you wouldn’t.</p>

<p>I realize that the app would act as if it were running on an iPad — but the Vision Pro is not really an iPad. It’s a device with <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/02/simple_tricks_and_nonsense">very different interactions</a> from the direct manipulation we’re used to on iPad. And the compatibility mode is a new thing because this device is a new thing — we don’t know how well it works and what the gotchas might be.</p>

<p>I could test it on the simulator, sure, but the simulator is a convenience for developers. It’s no replacement for running it on a real device.</p>

<p>And, yes, the app is open source, which could mean that other developers with a Vision Pro could help support it — but it’s important to remember that I’m the only person who <em>has</em> to support it. The NetNewsWire team is awesome, but I’m the one on the line for this.</p>

<p>So I want to be careful and go slowly, because if I made it available it would be extremely difficult to reverse the decision and take it away, even with an excellent reason.</p>

<p>I’m hoping that a consensus will form among developers that running apps on Vision Pro as iPad apps is fine, that it’s a cakewalk. If that happens, I’d go ahead and do it too. But it’s too soon for us to know that.</p>

<p>PS Why don’t I have a Vision Pro? I’m sure it’s an incredible technical achievement and an amazing experience — and pretty damn wonderful in just about every way — but it’s just not my thing. I like reading and writing mostly, plus making apps for reading and writing. My personal future of computing has been here for all these years — the Mac.</p>

<p>PPS Eventually the price will come down to where I’d consider buying one as a test device and for a little fun — but that may be a few years away. I’m hoping that we’ll find, sooner than that, that running as iPad on Vision Pro is a-okay.</p>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-02-04, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

One of the cool things about being a programmer is that you can decide to run code that you know has zero chance of working. "Let all hell break loose," a programmer can be heard to say quietly before clicking the Run button. Very few design professions get to do this, I imagine, unless they're psychotic.

## Resolving 'Temporary failure in name resolution' on Pi OS 12 Bookworm

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Raspberry Pi OS version 12 (based on Debian 12 Bookworm) uses NetworkManager instead of dhcpcd for managing network connections, DNS resolution settings, DHCP, etc.</p>

## Over the edge: the use of design tactics to undermine browser choice

date: 2024-02-04, from: OS News

In order to be able to choose their own browser, people must be free to download it, easily set it to default and to continue using it – all without interference from the operating system. Windows users do not currently enjoy this freedom of choice. To investigate Microsoft’s tactics and the impact on consumers, Mozilla commissioned Harry Brignull and Cennydd Bowles, independent researchers and experts in harmful design. Today, the researchers have published a report detailing how Microsoft prevents effective browser choice on Windows. In the report, they document how Microsoft places its own browser — Edge — at the center of its operating system and weaponizes Windows’ user interface design to undermine people selecting rival browsers. ↫ Mozilla Research We all already know Microsoft does these things, and of course, a study paid for by Mozilla agreeing with Mozilla is not exactly earth-shattering, but stuff like this is important for aiding in convincing regulators to do something about this stuff. It simply shouldn&#8217;t be legal to employ all kinds of nasty tricks and dark patterns to force people to use a certain browser.

## Niri: a scrollable-tiling Wayland compositor.

date: 2024-02-04, from: OS News

Niri is a scrollable, tiling window manager for Wayland. What does it mean for a tiling window manager to be scrollable? Windows are arranged in columns on an infinite strip going to the right. Opening a new window never causes existing windows to resize. Every monitor has its own separate window strip. Windows can never &#8220;overflow&#8221; onto an adjacent monitor. Workspaces are dynamic and arranged vertically. Every monitor has an independent set of workspaces, and there&#8217;s always one empty workspace present all the way down. ↫ Niri&#8217;s GitHub page Definitely an intriguing idea.
