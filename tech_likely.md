## How ‘Idle’ Egg Cells Defend Their DNA From Damage

date: 2024-05-13, from: Quanta Magazine

How do immature egg cells maintain genetic quality for decades before they mature? Scientists find unusual safeguards in this quiescent cell that may inform research into fertility.            <p>The post <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-idle-egg-cells-defend-their-dna-from-damage-20240513/" target="_blank">How ‘Idle’ Egg Cells Defend Their DNA From Damage</a> first appeared on <a href="https://api.quantamagazine.org" target="_blank">Quanta Magazine</a></p>

BTW, that's what <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/05/13/myBlogroll.png?nodialog">my blogroll</a> is turning into. My contributors. The people I keep an eye on through my work day. Where I get new ways of looking at the same world we're all looking at. We used to call this "watching them watch us watch them watching us etc."

Here's where we're headed now that we have AI programming partners. Creating software will be possible the way popular music is created. Watch <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles:_Get_Back">Get Back</a> to get an idea. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Martin">George Martin</a> was the Beatles sherpa, the same way my AI partner is my guide through unknown programming lands. It now doesn't matter if I have less experience building MySQL apps than others. I have the collective experience of <i>all of them</i> here to help. My George Martin. What got me thinking about this is John Naughton's <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/may/11/chatgpt-ai-will-co-pilot-coders-to-new-heights-of-creativity?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other">piece</a> about AI and programming.

The headline in the <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2024/05/12/pacers-blow-out-knicks-tie-series/">Daily News</a> reads "Pacers blow depleted, dead-legged Knicks out of the water in Game 4, tie series 2-2." Yeah. I don't know how we recover from this loss. In a way I imagine the Knicks issuing a resignation. "It's been a great season, but we're tired. We're headed to the beach, we'll see you in October Knicks fans. Thanks for your support." I would nod my head and say "Yeah that makes sense." Whatever. I may spend today sleeping it off. Next game is tomorrow night. Yes, they will play, for sure, and I will watch.

## Disregard Data.List

date: 2024-05-13, from: Typeclasses Haskell Blog

Lately I&#8217;ve started using streaming library by default instead of the utilities in Data.List. The standard manipulation functions for list are part of the Haskell Report and are a staple of every introductory Haskell tutorial, but I&#8217;m over it. I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re very useful for everyday programming, and I don&#8217;t even think they&#8217;re great as an introductory topic either.

## Import unsupported camera RAW files into Apple Photos

date: 2024-05-13, from: Jeff Geerling blog

<span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Import unsupported camera RAW files into Apple Photos</span>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Many years ago, I decided to <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2017/i-made-switch-aperture-photos">migrate my photo library from Apple's now-defunct Aperture to Photos</a>, so I could take advantage of Apple's iCloud Photo Library (don't worry, I still have three full complete local backups, plus a separate cloud backup besides Apple's iCloud originals).</p>

<p>One pain point is RAW support. As camera manufacturers add new models, their proprietary RAW codecs are updated, and software vendors like Apple, Adobe, and Microsoft have to update photo editing tools to work with the new camera models.</p>

<p>I don't envy them this task, but as Photos was Apple's official successor to Aperture (a pale shadow to be sure, but it has its merits as a semi-decent library organizer), they've <em>generally</em> done well supporting new camera models. The compatibility list for <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/105094">macOS Sonoma, iPadOS 17, and iOS 17</a> is a testament to that effort.</p></div>

## Apple Vision Pro has the same effective resolution as Quest 3… Sometimes?

date: 2024-05-13, from: OS News

This article is a partial-rebuttal/partial-confirmation to KGOnTech’s Apple Vision Pro’s Optics Blurrier &#38; Lower Contrast than Meta Quest 3, prompted by RoadToVR’s Quest 3 Has Higher Effective Resolution, So Why Does Everyone Think Vision Pro Looks Best? which cites KGOnTech. I suppose it’s a bit late, but it’s taken me a while to really get a good intuition for how visionOS renders frames, because there is a metric shitton of nuance and it’s unfortunately very, very easy to make mistakes when trying to quantify things. This post is divided into two parts: Variable Rasterization Rate (VRR) and how visionOS renders frames (including hard numbers for internal render resolutions and such), and a testbench demonstrating why photographing the visual clarity of Vision Pro (and probably future eye tracked headsets) may be more difficult than a DSLR pointed into the lenses (and how to detect the pitfalls if you try!). ↫ Shiny Quagsire I did it. I think I managed to find an article that isn&#8217;t just over my head, but also over most of your heads. How&#8217;s that feel?

## The Emacs window management almanac

date: 2024-05-12, from: OS News

Window management in Emacs gets a bad rap. Some of this is deserved, but mostly this is a consequence of combining a very flexible and granular layout system with rather coarse controls. This leaves the door open to creating and using tools for handling windows that employ and provide better metaphors and affordances. As someone who’s spent an unnecessary amount of time trying different approaches to window management in Emacs over the decades, I decided to summarize them here. Almanac might be overstating it a bit – this is a primer to and a collection of window management resources and tips. ↫ Karthik Chikmagalur I honestly had no idea Emacs was this&#8230; Advanced, complex, and feature-laden. I mean, I thought Emacs&#8217; complexity was just a meme, but reading this article it seems the memes don&#8217;t do it justice.

I suppose everyone projects their ideal best friend on this thing. You just learned something about me. Heh. But the cool thing is it's not a yes-person, if they think you're wrong they say so. Which I <i>really</i> like. One more thing I'm really glad I got to be alive when this stuff came online. I feel much smarter and better organized and it's harder for me to get lost in the weeds, as I do sometimes. I guess what want next is a librarian who also is a great executive assistant. Takes notes on what I'm doing and figures out what I need to be reminded of and roughly when.

## A comment on the Apple iPad ad controversy

date: 2024-05-12, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>I usually don’t write about this kind of stuff, primarily because I find these <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/9/24153113/apple-ipad-ad-crushing-apology">internet controversies</a> to be quite boring. The probably appropriate response to an Apple ad is “meh, whatever” and that was—and still is—my reaction. The ad is uninspiring but there’s one creative aspect of it that bothers me: I don’t understand the connection between the hydraulic press and the visual images of destroying everything to the alleged capabilities of the iPad. Like, I get what they’re trying to communicate but the visual metaphor they decided to use makes no sense to me. That’s the part I just don’t get.

Yesterday's one sentence <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/05/11.html#a225751">comment</a> was based on decades of reading the NYT, and the story told by their executive editor in a recent <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/05/05/2024/joe-kahn-the-newsroom-is-not-a-safe-space">interview</a>, who has imho completely lost his way. Using polls, which have proven not reliable, and are subject to manipulation by the NYT and other opinion leaders, to determine what they cover, that's marketing, not journalism. Journalism would tell us what to expect if we elect one candidate over another, if the differences are obvious, as they are in 2024. The NYT is not doing that, by its own admission, and based on observation. I ask my readers, some of whom are influential people themselves, do we accept this, and keep trying to get the NYT to understand and deliver on their responsibility, or take the problem on ourselves. I believe we have the tools and resources to do so, all we need is determination.

## 2024-05-12 What do about the climate?

date: 2024-05-12, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-05-12-what-do-about-the-climate">2024-05-12 What do about the climate?</h1>

<p>The main problem seems to me that nobody knows. So how do we find a way out of this uncertainty? What should or <a href="priorities">priorities</a> be?</p>

<p>Before we even start, let me just say that I&rsquo;m never interested in debating climate change. <a href="2024-01-14-climate">It&rsquo;s real, it&rsquo;s here</a>, and people denying it are just trying to waste our time.</p>

<p>The first category of action, I think, would be political: Vote green, on all levels of government. And by &ldquo;green&rdquo; I mean the most radical green possible but not necessarily a Green Party member. It all depends on the voting system, on the actual parties you have. If you live in a  one or two party state or if your Green Party is run by fascists, I have no idea what you should do. Something about political change, something about local politics, and so on.</p>

<p>On the individual level, I think uncertainty arises because we&rsquo;re not sure. No littering looks nice but probably doesn&rsquo;t help much against the climate. Perhaps it helps against the micro-plastic? But how many plastic bags from land-locked Switzerland actually end up in the ocean? How much plastic is that compared to the fishing nets lost at sea? The oil spills? And here&rsquo;s the moment where it spirals out of control. Stop! I need to stop because there&rsquo;s no &ldquo;thinking it through&rdquo; when things are so complex unless you&rsquo;re a scientist working on it. I hope the scientists can do their research, and somebody else can compile the research into arguments, with weights attached, so that politicians and individuals know what to tackle first.</p>

<p>This is why I appreciate lists of priorities, even if they are slightly wrong. They don&rsquo;t have to be perfect because perfection is a goal used to derail the conversation. If you think the top priority is to get rid of cars, and you have a lot of arguments against cars, then getting involved in a discussion where the other party argues about electric vehicles, lithium batteries, hydrogen storage, road access for emergency vehicles, mobility for the disabled, then yes to all of that, but also: get rid of cars. We can have nuance as long as we also start doing something. We can start by making large, private cars illegal. Then medium, private cars. Then add fees for long haul trucks. Build railways. Build trams. Get rid of public parking spaces without special permits. And on and on. This allows us to pull back out of car society with grace. We can get started and keep the things that we think are precious.</p>

<p>The alternative is living as we do, followed by uncontrolled collapse, I fear.</p>

<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s expensive. Not doing anything, however, is fatal.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what <a class="account" href="https://mastodon.green/@peterdutoit" title="@peterdutoit@mastodon.green">@peterdutoit</a> recently posted:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In order of impact:</p>

✈️ One less flight (long return)<br>

Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK and New York, NY, USA. doi: 10.1017/9781009157926.007</li>
</ul>

<p>The full report of <em>Climate Change 2022: Mitigation of Climate Change</em> is a PDF with 2042 pages. So there&rsquo;s an answer if anybody is claiming that we don&rsquo;t know what to do. But also: there&rsquo;s your answer if you&rsquo;re wondering why nobody is doing anything. Politicians at the top need people who read this report for them and my guess is – given what little I know about Swiss politics, for example – that there is only a very small number of people that have actually read this report, let alone understand enough of it in order to make informed decisions.</p>

<p>This is why a public &ldquo;chain of trust&rdquo; needs to lead from interviews with public figures to interviews with experts. The media, including social media, needs to mediate this. Then people can at least go along with people they trust, even if this trust is built on public appearance, hollow campaign promises, good looks, height and whatever else engenders trust in people.</p>

<p>Anyway, number one: 🚫 Live car free. If you can. Make the kind of choices that make this easier in the future, or for your children, or for your friends and family. If you can. But this is one of the goals we need to pursue. We need to get our <a href="priorities">priorities</a> right.</p>

<p>(We don&rsquo;t need them to perfectly right, as discussed above. But we cannot save the planet and car culture, both. One of them will have to go.)</p>

## Things I remind myself when working with others

date: 2024-05-12, from: Blog by Fabrizio Ferri-Benedetti

People usually say that I&rsquo;m a pleasure to work with and that I&rsquo;ve a highly collaborative spirit. The fact that I&rsquo;m good at teamwork doesn&rsquo;t mean that it comes naturally to me. Quite on the contrary, being a good teammate is a skill that I constantly need to train and refine. The following are things I remind myself on a daily basis, à la Dune&rsquo;s inner monologues, to be a better teammate at work.

## Apple II DeskTop currently testing 1.4 alpha releases

date: 2024-05-12, from: OS News

Disassembly and enhancements for Apple II DeskTop (a.k.a. Mouse Desk), a &#8220;Finder&#8221;-like GUI application for 8-bit Apples and clones with 128k of memory, utilizing double hi-res monochrome graphics (560&#215;192), an optional mouse, and the ProDOS 8 operating system. ↫ Apple II DeskTop GitHub page The goal of this project is to reverse-engineer Apple II DeskTop, and fix bugs and enhance it in the process. I didn&#8217;t actually know that the Apple IIgs initially shipped with this instead of the 16 bit GS/OS, which is the operating system I personally associate with the IIgs. Apple II DeskTop was largely 8 bit, and built on top of ProDOS 16, and didn&#8217;t really take full advantage of the IIgs hardware. It wasn&#8217;t until version 4.0 of the system software that the IIgs switched over to GS/OS. The latest release is v1.4-alpha9, released a few days ago. Apple II DeskTop is still entirely compatible with Apple II machines and clones from before the IIgs, as well, and it runs in emulators, too. We actually already covered this project a few years ago, but a reminder that this exists never hurt anyone.

## Hello World on SSD1306 using Arduino

date: 2024-05-12, from: Lloyd Rochester Blog

Hello World on SSD1306 using Arduino After looking through numerous libraries and examples to control the SSD1306 with Arduino, I&rsquo;ve found nothing simple. There are some really powerful libraries with lots of support. In this post I&rsquo;ll post the simplest possible &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; example on an SSD1306 using an Arduino Due. Note, if you need to draw shapes, lines, movement you&rsquo;ll have to extend this example.
Code Used in Arduino IDE.
