Sometimes ChatGPT just <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/9c47fbcf-7ba9-43a1-bd6b-be574c17ecf9">repeats itself</a>. Even when you demand that it stop repeating itself, it repeats itself.

Has anyone ever asked you, on the social web, what you think about something? Not a message to everyone to which you could reply, but a message specifically to you? I try to do it when I think of it. I find you can get really interesting ideas that way sometimes. And also it's a way spreading some love around the world, because people like to be asked what they think, I've found.

I'm going through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica_(2004_TV_series)">Battlestar Galactica</a> for the third time. One of the major themes of the show is that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylons">robots</a> that the Capricans created went to war with the humans and almost but not quite wiped them out. Almost every episode is about the conflict between humans and the AIs. It's a fantastic show, the acting and the writing is far beyond most TV series. I'm at the beginning of season 3. I'll let you know if I figure anything out from watching the series again.

I watched 15 minutes of the playoff game between the Boston team and the Indiana team and found that I only gave the very slightest of fucks. I knew all the players. I like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obi_Toppin">Obi Toppin</a>, a former Knick we traded for some reason. That's about it for my inner fan. I turned it off as it went to overtime and looked up the result when I got up in the morning. That's how I like my NBA, frankly.

## 2024-05-12 What to do about the climate?

date: 2024-05-22, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-05-12-what-to-do-about-the-climate">2024-05-12 What to do about the climate?</h1>

<p>The main problem seems to me that nobody knows. So how do we find a way out of this uncertainty? What should or <a href="priorities">priorities</a> be?</p>

<p>Before we even start, let me just say that I&rsquo;m never interested in debating climate change. <a href="2024-01-14-climate">It&rsquo;s real, it&rsquo;s here</a>, and people denying it are just trying to waste our time.</p>

<p>The first category of action, I think, would be political: Vote green, on all levels of government. And by &ldquo;green&rdquo; I mean the most radical green possible but not necessarily a Green Party member. It all depends on the voting system, on the actual parties you have. If you live in a  one or two party state or if your Green Party is run by fascists, I have no idea what you should do. Something about political change, something about local politics, and so on.</p>

<p>On the individual level, I think uncertainty arises because we&rsquo;re not sure. No littering looks nice but probably doesn&rsquo;t help much against the climate. Perhaps it helps against the micro-plastic? But how many plastic bags from land-locked Switzerland actually end up in the ocean? How much plastic is that compared to the fishing nets lost at sea? The oil spills? And here&rsquo;s the moment where it spirals out of control. Stop! I need to stop because there&rsquo;s no &ldquo;thinking it through&rdquo; when things are so complex unless you&rsquo;re a scientist working on it. I hope the scientists can do their research, and somebody else can compile the research into arguments, with weights attached, so that politicians and individuals know what to tackle first.</p>

<p>This is why I appreciate lists of priorities, even if they are slightly wrong. They don&rsquo;t have to be perfect because perfection is a goal used to derail the conversation. If you think the top priority is to get rid of cars, and you have a lot of arguments against cars, then getting involved in a discussion where the other party argues about electric vehicles, lithium batteries, hydrogen storage, road access for emergency vehicles, mobility for the disabled, then yes to all of that, but also: get rid of cars. We can have nuance as long as we also start doing something. We can start by making large, private cars illegal. Then medium, private cars. Then add fees for long haul trucks. Build railways. Build trams. Get rid of public parking spaces without special permits. And on and on. This allows us to pull back out of car society with grace. We can get started and keep the things that we think are precious.</p>

<p>The alternative is living as we do, followed by uncontrolled collapse, I fear.</p>

<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s expensive. Not doing anything, however, is fatal.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what <a class="account" href="https://mastodon.green/@peterdutoit" title="@peterdutoit@mastodon.green">@peterdutoit</a> recently posted:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In order of impact:</p>

<p>üö´ Live car free<br>
üöô Shift to BEV [i.e. Battery Electric Vehicle]<br>
‚úàÔ∏è One less flight (long return)<br>
‚òÄÔ∏è Use renewable energy<br>
üöã Shift to public transport<br>
üî® Refurbishment and renovation<br>
ü•ó Vegan diet<br>

Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK and New York, NY, USA. doi: 10.1017/9781009157926.007</li>
</ul>

<p>The full report of <em>Climate Change 2022: Mitigation of Climate Change</em> is a PDF with 2042 pages. So there&rsquo;s an answer if anybody is claiming that we don&rsquo;t know what to do. But also: there&rsquo;s your answer if you&rsquo;re wondering why nobody is doing anything. Politicians at the top need people who read this report for them and my guess is ‚Äì given what little I know about Swiss politics, for example ‚Äì that there is only a very small number of people that have actually read this report, let alone understand enough of it in order to make informed decisions.</p>

<p>This is why a public &ldquo;chain of trust&rdquo; needs to lead from interviews with public figures to interviews with experts. The media, including social media, needs to mediate this. Then people can at least go along with people they trust, even if this trust is built on public appearance, hollow campaign promises, good looks, height and whatever else engenders trust in people.</p>

<p>Anyway, number one: üö´ Live car free. If you can. Make the kind of choices that make this easier in the future, or for your children, or for your friends and family. If you can. But this is one of the goals we need to pursue. We need to get our <a href="priorities">priorities</a> right.</p>

<p>(We don&rsquo;t need them to perfectly right, as discussed above. But we cannot save the planet and car culture, both. One of them will have to go.)</p>

## How to make Google‚Äôs new ‚ÄúWeb‚Äù search option the default in your browser

date: 2024-05-21, from: OS News

Last week, Google unveiled a new little feature in Google Search, called &#8220;Web&#8221;. Residing alongside the various other options like &#8220;All&#8221;, &#8220;Images&#8221;, &#8220;Video&#8221;, and so on, its goal is to effectively strip Google Search results from everything we generally don&#8217;t like, and just present a list of actual links to actual websites. It turns out it&#8217;s quite simple to set this as your default search &#8220;engine&#8221; in your browser, so somebody made a website to make that process a little easier. On May 15th Google released a new &#8220;Web&#8221; filter that removes &#8220;AI Overview&#8221; and other clutter, leaving only traditional web results. Here is how you can set &#8220;Google Web&#8221; as your default search engine. ‚Ü´ TenBlueLinks.org It&#8217;s important to note that this is not some separate search engine, and that no data is flowing any differently than when using regular Google. All this does is append the parameter UDM=14 to the URL, which loads the option &#8220;Web&#8221;.

<p>I have two types of posts on this site: regular blog posts and ‚Äúmoments‚Äù. Moments are my personal Instagram, posts with an image and a short caption. As the name suggests, those are moments in time and so there is no real planning behind them. This is how it works:</p>
<ol>
<li>I take a picture with my iPhone</li>
<li>I do some light editing using Snapseed</li>
<li>I log into my site‚Äôs dashboard</li>
<li>I create a new post</li>
<li>I write a title that always starts with ‚ÄúA moment...‚Äù</li>
<li>I upload the picture and I write the short post directly on the admin interface</li>
<li>I hit save</li>
</ol>
<p>There‚Äôs no proofreading involved, no drafts, no nothing. I take a photo, I upload it, write something and move on with my day.</p>
<p>As for the regular posts, those are handled a bit differently. My blog has no structure behind its schedule. I post about whatever I find interesting at any point in time. I have a to-do list with a bunch of random ideas that usually appear in my head out of nowhere when I‚Äôm outside for a walk. Those entries in my to-do are either a single line‚Äîfor example <em>Taxonomy of personal websites</em>‚Äîor a combination of title + short description‚Äî<em>Good conversations: What‚Äôs the ideal workflow for a good conversation online</em>.</p>
<p>When I feel in the mood to post something I either pick one of those entries or, like I‚Äôm doing now, I write about something else, usually in response to something I read somewhere else. The workflow is the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>I open iA Writer </li>
<li>I write my post</li>
<li>When I feel I‚Äôm done I copy-paste into Grammarly to check for typos or other silly issues</li>
<li>I open my site‚Äôs dashboard</li>
<li>I create a new post</li>
<li>I copy-paste from Grammarly and I hit publish</li>
<li>I then log into Buttondown.email, create a new email, paste the content of the new post and hit send because there are some 100 or so people who want to get my posts via email</li>
</ol>
<p>Again, I don‚Äôt do drafts, don‚Äôt do editing. I have an idea, I write it down, check for silly issues with Grammarly and then I post it online. That‚Äôs how my blog works.</p>
<h2>People and Blogs</h2>
<p>As I mentioned before, my site also hosts the People and Blogs interviews. The workflow for those posts is a bit different and it goes like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>I have a list of potential guests on Airtable</li>
<li>I cold email a bunch of people and ask if they want to be part of the series</li>
<li>If they say yes I send them the questions</li>
<li>When I get back the answers I create a new post</li>
<li>I format their answers in markdown and add the intro and outro and store it as a draft</li>
<li>On the week the interview is scheduled to go live I send a link to the draft to the guest to give them time to do a final check and to also give them a final chance to add or remove anything from the answers</li>
<li>Once the interview is good to go I log into the Buttondown account, create the interview and schedule it to go live on Friday</li>
<li>5 minutes before it‚Äôs time to go live a reminder rings on my phone to make sure I don‚Äôt forget to publish the post</li>
<li>I log into my dashboard and hit publish</li>
</ol>
<p>And that‚Äôs how it works for P&amp;B. Could I add an auto-publish feature on my site? Sure. Would that save me time? Maybe 20 seconds a week. Is it worth it? Absolutely not.</p>
<p>And those are my workflows. Nothing fancy, very few tools and very little automation.

## noTunes: a macOS application to prevent iTunes or Apple Music from launching

date: 2024-05-21, from: OS News

noTunes is a macOS application that will prevent iTunes or Apple Music from launching. Simply launch the noTunes app and iTunes/Music will no longer be able to launch. For example, when bluetooth headphones reconnect. You can toggle the apps functionality via the menu bar icon with a simple left click. ‚Ü´ noTunes GitHub page Apparently, this is such a common complaint that an application had to be made just to gain some semblance of control over what some people still refer to as &#8220;their&#8221; computer. For both macOS and Windows, there&#8217;s a giant industry &#8211; you can&#8217;t really call it a cottage industry anymore at this point &#8211; of tools, applications, and fixes just to deal with or avoid all the user-hostile, anti-choice garbage Apple and Microsoft shove into their respective operating systems. As a Linux user &#8211; and recent OpenBSD convert &#8211; I find this absolutely wild. Following any Apple podcast, or reading any Windows website, makes it so clear just how many hoops these people have to jump through and how many weirdly-shaped holes they have to contort into just to be able to gain some vague semblance of ownership of their own hardware. I&#8217;m not judging &#8211; we all have areas in our lives where we do this, they just differ from person to person &#8211; but it&#8217;s still confronting to see it so clearly, all the time.

An iPad was like a magazine, but what would you tell a young person who never used a magazine? What is it? Right now almost everyone is looking at AI from the point of view of a world with no AI. And it turns out that once you have it, it starts solving problems you never thought would be associated with AI. But there it is. You just have to sit down and start playing and you find all kinds of amazing things. But if you don't try it, you'll always be looking at it from the past. We've seen this kind of explosive growth in the power of the individual human. It's a 20-minute podcast and I'm all over the map, but it's good stuff, imho of course.

## Scarlett Johansson says she is ‚Äòshocked, angered‚Äô over new ChatGPT voice

date: 2024-05-21, from: OS News

Lawyers for Scarlett Johansson are demanding that OpenAI disclose how it developed an AI personal assistant voice that the actress says sounds uncannily similar to her own. Johansson&#8217;s legal team has sent OpenAI two letters asking the company to detail the process by which it developed a voice the tech company dubbed &#8220;Sky,&#8221; Johansson&#8217;s publicist told NPR in a revelation that has not been previously reported. ‚Ü´ Bobby Allyn at NPR This story highlights just how much disdain techbros have for the work of creative people. Here&#8217;s the timeline: Techbros like Sam Altman deeply despise and undervalue the work of creatives, believing human creativity to be merely an equation to be solved, definable by an algorithm. To people like him, creative work has no value, and as such, is up for grabs to be taken and cut up for his algorithms to spit out as &#8220;new&#8221; works. This story highlights this perfectly. The sleaze runs deep with Altman and OpenAI.

## Why Tesla FSD is unsafe

date: 2024-05-21, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/05/21/teslaModelY.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Here's what I've learned from <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+tesla">owing</a> a Tesla Model Y with <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/10/230303.html">Full Self Driving</a>. I don't believe it's safe. It absolutely does require your full attention at all times. You are still driving the car. I've seen it do crazy stuff in simple situations. I've seen it panic, basically throw its hands in the air and say Dave this is your problem. That's why you always have to be ready, as if you were driving the car yourself because at any moment you could be. You never know when it's going to happen. Now focus on that moment. Your car has given up and turned the driving over to you. How much experience do you have with that? Do you know where to look? Do you hit the brakes or veer to the left or right? If you're an experienced driver, a lot of these reactions are completely programmed into the lower levels of the brain. You don't have to think at all. When the car panics, I tend to panic. If I had 10 or 20 years experience with this connection, then I guess it's probably safe. But not the way it is. </p>
<p>I'm amazed there aren't more terrible accidents with FSD, and that Tesla still promotes this as "self-driving," which it is not. </p>
<p>Also, I love my Tesla. Every time I get into that mofo I feel privileged. It looks like a Toyota Camry but drives like a muscle car. I might still switch to a <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/kia/ev9">Kia EV9</a>, at some point, if it drives as well as the Tesla, simply because the nearest Telsa dealer is over an hour away, and the <a href="https://www.romeokia.com/">Kia dealer</a> is in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingston,_New_York">Kingston</a> which is practically in the neighborhood. </p>

## GHC release plans

date: 2024-05-21, from: Glasgow Haskell Compiler

<h1>GHC release plans</h1>
<h4 class="text-muted">Zubin Duggal - 2024-05-21</h4>

<p>This post sets out our plans for upcoming releases in the next few months.</p>
<p>Given limited time and resources, we plan to prioritise work on the 9.6, 9.10
and master branches of GHC for the next few months.</p>
<h2 id="section">9.10</h2>
<p>With the release of 9.10.1, we look forward to the broader adoption of this release.</p>
<p>New releases in this series will continue at the usual rate depending on if and
when any significant regressions or issues arise.</p>
<h2 id="section-1">9.6</h2>
<p>9.6.5 seems to be a relatively stable release so far and we plan to prioritise
fixes given the relatively higher adoption of this branch. We know of one
significant issue (<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/22210">#22210</a>) to do with object merging arising from the
interactions between GHC and cabal on certain platforms including Darwin with a
<code>brew</code>-provisioned clang toolchain.</p>
<p>The upcoming 9.6.6 release will include a fix for this issue along with others
that may arise. The 9.6.6 release is tentatively scheduled for the end of June,
to allow for sufficient time following the 9.6.5 release for bugs and issues to be
reported and addressed.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">9.8</h2>
<p>We plan to continue supporting this release series for the near future,
but updates to this series might proceed at a slower rate than usual as we
prioritise the new release (9.10) and supporting earlier releases with high
uptake (9.6).</p>
<p>The next release in this series will likely be scheduled after the 9.6.6 release.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>We hope that this clarfies the current state of our release branches.
If you have any questions or comments then please be in touch via
<a href="mailto:ghc-devs@haskell.org" class="uri">mailto:ghc-devs@haskell.org</a>.</p>

## Xeon Phi support removed in GCC 15 compiler

date: 2024-05-20, from: OS News

Last week I wrote about Intel aiming to remove Xeon Phi support in GCC 15 with the products being end-of-life and deprecated in GCC 14. While some openly wondered whether the open-source community would allow it given the Xeon Phi accelerators were available to buy just a few years ago and at some very low prices going back years so some potentially finding use still out of them especially during this AI boom (and still readily available to buy used for around ~$50 USD), today the Intel Xeon Phi support was indeed removed. ‚Ü´ Michael Larabel Xeon Phi PCIe cards are incredibly cheap on eBay, and every now and then my mouse hovers over the buy button &#8211; but I always realise just in time that the cards have become quite difficult to use, since support for them, already sparse to begin with, is only getting worse by the day. Support for them was already removed in Linux 5.10, and now GCC is pulling he plug too, so the only option is to keep using old kernels, or pass the card on to a VM running an older Linux kernel version, which is a lot of headache for what is essentially a weird toy for nerds at this point. GCC 15 will also, sadly, remove support for Itanium, which, as I&#8217;ve said before, is a huge disgrace and a grave mistake. Itanium is the future, and will stomp all over crappy architectures like x86 and ARM. With this deprecation, GCC relegates itself to the dustbin of history.

## Modernizing the AntennaPod code structure

date: 2024-05-20, from: OS News

AntennaPod has been around for a long time &#8211; the first bit of code was published in 2011. Since then, the app has grown massively and had several main developers. The beauty of open-source is that so many people can contribute and make a great app together. But sometimes having many people work on a project can lead to different ways of thinking about how to structure the project. Because of this, AntennaPod gradually grew to have a number of weird code constructs. Our latest release, version 3.4, fixes this. ‚Ü´ ByteHamster The AntennaPod team had an incredible task ahead of itself, and while it took them a few years, they pulled it off. The code structure graphs from before and after the code restructuring illustrate better than words ever could what they achieved. Thy changed 10000 lines of source code in 62 pull requests for this restructuring alone, while still adding new major features in the meantime. Pretty incredible.

## Microsoft gives Windows new compiler, kernel, scheduler, and x86 translation layer on ARM

date: 2024-05-20, from: OS News

Microsoft&#8217;s developer conference Build is taking place this week, so there&#8217;s been some major Windows news and announcements, and for once &#8211; we&#8217;re not talking about more ads in your operating system, or even &#8220;AI&#8221; shoehorned into, I don&#8217;t know, Phone Dialer or Windows Fax and Scan. First and foremost, Windows is going to get a new compiler, kernel, and scheduler, but despite such massive low-level changes, the marketing version number won&#8217;t jump from 11 to 12. Of course, we all know the marketing version number has nothing to do with the actual Windows NT version number, which currently sits at 10. The Windows NT version number, meanwhile, is actually also meaningless, since it magically jumps around left and right too, going from 6.2 to 10 between Windows 8.1 and Windows 10, where it has stayed ever since. &#8220;We really focused on modernizing this update of Windows 11,&#8221; said Microsoft Corporate Vice President of Windows and Devices Pavan Davuluri at a technical briefing on Microsoft&#8217;s campus in mid-April. &#8220;We engineered this update of Windows 11 with a real focus on AI inference and taking advantage of the Arm64 instruction set at every layer of the operating system stack. For us, what this meant really was building a new compiler in Windows. We built a new kernel in Windows on top of that compiler. We now have new schedulers in the operating system that take advantage of these new SoC architecture.&#8221; ‚Ü´ Andrew Cunningham at Ars Technica The focus is clearly on ARM here, which coincides with the launch of Qualcomm&#8217;s Snapdragon X Elite, a new SoC that finally seems to truly make ARM laptops that aren&#8217;t from Apple a real, competitive thing &#8211; so much so that Qualcomm is even breaking with tradition and taking Linux support very seriously for this new chip. Microsoft also unveiled the name for its new x86 translation layer for Windows on ARM: Prism. Microsoft told Ars Technica that Prism is as fast as Apple&#8217;s Rosetta 2, which is interesting because Apple&#8217;s M series chips contain special silicon to speed up the translation process, making me wonder if Qualcomm has done the same, or is just brute-forcing it. Performance like this means the apps customers love work great. Microsoft has partnered closely with developers across the globe to optimize their applications for this processor. In addition, the powerful new Prism emulation engine delivers a 2x performance boost compared to Surface Pro 9 with 5G. On the new Surface Pro and Surface Laptop, powered by Snapdragon X Elite and Snapdragon X Plus processors, experiences like Adobe Creative Cloud, Microsoft 365 and Chrome will feel snappy, quick and responsive. ‚Ü´ Pete Kyriacou on the Windows blog The new Windows on ARM machines using the Snapdragon X Elite will be marketed under the new Copilot+ brand name, which brings with it some requirements, the biggest of which is the neural processing unit: it must be capable of at least 40 trillion operations per second. At the time of writing, the only Windows-capable processor that can boast such numbers is, of course, the new Snapdragon X Elite. AMD and Intel need not apply. They simply cannot match this. Microsoft tied a bow on all this stuff by unveiling the new Surface Pro and new Surface Laptop, both powered by the new Snapdragon SoCs. You can preorder them today, but they won&#8217;t be available until 18 June.

## A post I wrote on Twitter

date: 2024-05-20, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Here's <a href="https://x.com/davewiner/status/1792237882679156983">something</a> you may find funny if you study the evolution of software technology.</p>
<ol>
<li>In the 80s there were all kinds of ideas about how to do hypertext. Mostly they called for two-way links, so you could walk the graph in any direction you like. These were hard to implement and required the two parties work with each other, and that never happened. </li>
<li>In the early 90s along comes Tim Berners-Lee, a random NextStep developer who wanted to play and he for whatever reason didn't wait to figure out how to boil the ocean with two-way links, he just did one-way links and instead of inventing a new protocol he just implemented it on top of TCP/IP. While the purists were debating its purity it took off, broke all records, made a lot of people very rich.</li>
<li>A few years later, Tim Berners-Lee, the same guy who made the web, wants to layer a new protocol on top of the web -- the Semantic Web. He wanted people to be able to query the web the way you query a database. "show me all the widgets on sale in urbana for less than $20." Like that.</li>
<li>It never happened for the same reason the two-way hyperlinks didn't, it required cooperation. You couldn't just throw together a demo in an afternoon as a fun side project like you could with the web (I speak from experience, my first success with the web took five freaking minutes). </li>
<li>Now when Google or some other browser maker integrates ChatGPT-like functionality in their browser, as a side-effect, you will get TBL's Semantic Web. It won't require any cooperation and that's why it will work.</li>

## KDE Plasma 6 comes to OpenBSD

date: 2024-05-20, from: OS News

Last year marked a significant milestone for both myself and the OpenBSD desktop community, as we successfully ported KDE Plasma 5 and all dependencies to OpenBSD. With the release of OpenBSD 7.5 on April 5, 2024, KDE Plasma in version 5.27.10 has become a part of our lovely operating system. This success is the result of years of development work and commitment to achieving this goal. KDE launched version 6 of its Plasma desktop environment on February 28, 2024, bringing numerous updates and features as well as the major switch to Qt6. I am immensely proud that the OpenBSD team has managed to prepare for this major update so swiftly. All necessary components have been committed to our CVS tree, and the packages will soon be available. ‚Ü´ Rafael Sadowski Excellent news for OpenBSD users who don&#8217;t wish to be using GNOME, Xfce, or one of the smaller build-it-yourself desktop environments. My dual-Xeon workstation, which I switched over from Fedora KDE to OpenBSD, runs Xfce, because I feel a smaller desktop environment is a more natural fit for OpenBSD, but I&#8217;m very happy to know that I have KDE to fall back on in case Xfce turns out not to be a good fit for me in the long term. I&#8217;ll give the OpenBSD developers an other experts in that community some more time to iron out any wrinkles, and then I&#8217;ll probably give it a go to see just how well KDE will be integrated with the OpenBSD base system.

## Windows Server 2025 to ship with DTrace by default

date: 2024-05-20, from: OS News

Windows Server 2025 comes equipped with dtrace as a native tool. DTrace is a command-line utility that enables users to monitor and troubleshoot their system&#8217;s performance in real-time. DTrace allows users to dynamically instrument both the kernel and user-space code without any need to modify the code itself. This versatile tool supports a range of data collection and analysis techniques, such as aggregations, histograms, and tracing of user-level events. To learn more, see DTrace for command line help and DTrace on Windows for additional capabilities. ‚Ü´ What&#8217;s new in Windows Server 2025 DTrace was originally developed by Sun as part of Solaris, but eventually made its way to other operating systems as Sun collapsed in on itself and Oracle gave it the final push. DTrace is available for the various surviving Solars-based operating systems, Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, macOS, and QNX, and Microsoft ported DTrace from FreeBSD to Windows back in 2018. With Windows Server 2025, DTrace will be shipped out of the box.

## pg_dumpbinary v2.17 released

date: 2024-05-20, from: PostgreSQL News

<p><strong>Grenoble, France - Mai 20, 2024</strong></p>
<h2>pg_dumpbinary</h2>
<p><code>pg_dumpbinary</code> dumps a PostgreSQL database to a binary format. The resulting dump must be restored
using <code>pg_restorebinary</code>, which is provided.</p>
<p>This release adds two new options to command pg_restorebinary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add option <code>-C, --create</code> to pg_restorebinary to create the database
  before restoring into it. Like with pg_restore you must provide a
  database to connect using the <code>-d</code> option.</li>
<li>Add <code>--dump-create</code> to print to stdout the create and alter database
  statements.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>pg_dumpbinary</code> is useful when:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have bytea that can not be exported by <code>pg_dump</code> because the
  total size of the escape/hex output exceeds 1Gb.</li>
<li>You have custom type that stores <code>\0</code> internally in bytea but data
  are exported by pg_dump as char/varchar/text.  In this case pg_dump
  truncates all data after the first <code>\0</code>, resulting in data loss.</li>
<li>Other cases where a binary output format is useful.</li>
</ul>
<p>In these kinds of cases <code>pg_dumpbinary</code> helps by dumping the
PostgreSQL database in a binary format. In all other cases
the pg_dump/pg_restore commands distributed with PostgreSQL are
preferred.</p>
<p>See the documentation for a more complete description of available
features.</p>
<h2>Links &amp; Credits</h2>

<p>Let‚Äôs get the obvious question out the way first: ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù And I, errr, don‚Äôt have a good reason. It‚Äôs <a href="/blog/2021/5/3/visiting-the-eu/">not the first time</a> I‚Äôve done a big themed running project, but it‚Äôs by far the biggest I‚Äôve <em>ever</em> done.</p>
<p>Second obvious question: ‚Äúwas it a good idea?‚Äù Kinda‚Ä¶ I really enjoyed running through a lot of the countryside, and for the most part the Thames Path is very easy to run on. It‚Äôs also mostly well connected with public transport, which makes the point-to-point nature of the runs manageable. But on the other hand I often spent far more time travelling than running, which made it a much larger time commitment than ‚Äújust‚Äù 20 weekend half marathons.</p>
<p>The best part of this project was seeing the contrast in landscapes and communities across the length of the river. Until now my only familiarity with the Thames was with its murky, curvy path through London or the college boathouses in Oxford.</p>

<p>An interesting historical pattern with the Thames ‚Äî as with <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/713101">many English cities</a> ‚Äî is that effluence flows downstream and affluence upstream. A lot of this has to do with the Thames‚Äôs role in London‚Äôs history: for centuries waste water was literally dumped in the river. Land up river became more desirable. It‚Äôs no historical accident that the royal court at Hampton Court Palace was far west of the City of London.</p>
<p>Those historical trends are reflected today, even as sewage practices have improved (<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-67357566">a little</a>) and London de-industrialised. House prices are twice as high in Richmond-upon-Thames in south-west London than Bexley, in south-east London. Further out of London, on an Essex-bound train I overheard a group of men lamenting the loss of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_men%27s_club">working men‚Äôs clubs</a>, an important <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_place">third place</a> in their communities, whilst in Oxfordshire I sat near a <em>frightfully</em> posh former Home Secretary concluding with a group of friends that taking the train to a party was a ‚Äúterrifically smart‚Äù decision. (Decisions they made in government weren‚Äôt quite so clever.)</p>
<p>Deeper into the country the Thames cuts a path through ‚Äúgreen and pleasant‚Äù English countryside. Over the course of my 20 runs I developed a newfound appreciation for it. I‚Äôve genuinely come to believe that we‚Äôre <em>incredibly</em> fortunate in the UK to be so well connected to so much accessible, open space.</p>

<h2 id="2024-05-19-running-the-river-thamesgear">Gear</h2>
<p>I ran with a running vest, a 1.5L Osprey water bladder, a handful of snacks (Clif bars in particular), gels, AirPods, iPhone, and Apple Watch Ultra. I experimented with cheaper water bladders but they‚Äôre a false economy: after a few runs they‚Äôd start to leak and I‚Äôd have to replace them.</p>

<figcaption>

</figure>
<p>The Watch was the MVP of all these: I used <a href="https://pedometer.app">Pedometer++</a> to display my planned route and route taken throughout each run. The app supports both OpenStreetMap and Ordnance Survey tiles; I generally preferred the former as they were clearer on the small display.</p>
<p>For the most part I was following the Thames Path, but I often deviated around it to either explore other countryside or take shortcuts on routes that would otherwise be too long in one go.</p>
<h2 id="2024-05-19-running-the-river-thamesconditions">Conditions</h2>
<p>I ran mostly in winter and spring 2023 and spring 2024. In the winter months the path was often <em>very</em> muddy, whilst in spring there were sections with very overgrown grass (which was joyless with my hayfever). The Thames burst its banks last year, flooding parts of the path. The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/river-thames-restrictions-and-closures">Environment Agency has pages monitoring current river conditions</a>.</p>
<p>Towards the source of the river the Thames Path is often just a trodden path along the edge of fields. This makes for a very uneven surface: I had to slow down to avoid turning an ankle.</p>
<p>I only ran in the summer once, but even in spring it was often 20¬∫+ and sunny. Most of the route is <em>very</em> exposed: by the end I regularly ran with a baseball cap.</p>
<h2 id="2024-05-19-running-the-river-thameslogistics">Logistics</h2>
<p>I live in London, which made travel to and from each run easy. (Cities in the UK are well connected by rail to London and <em>far</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beeching_cuts">less well to one another</a>.) All in I spent about ¬£400 on train tickets, local buses, and (only twice) taxis. I used a railcard to decrease costs but otherwise I generally optimised for time. I‚Äôve no doubt that booking advance singles, split tickets, or cheaper train lines could reduce the cost by at least ¬£100.</p>
<p>At the end of each run I made a tradition of buying a meal deal (or equivalent) and extra snacks: I spent a further ¬£200 on these.</p>
<p>Between Lechlade, Gloucestershire and Teddington, London the Thames is interrupted by dozens of locks. These locks often have extra facilities for boaters, which <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/river-thames-locks-and-facilities-for-boaters">the Environment Agency lists here</a>. I learned way, way too late (literally at the <em>last</em> lock I ran past) that this often includes drinking water taps that you can use to refill water bottles. A lock keeper recommended running the tap for 30s before using it.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve posted GPX files for all the routes below.</p>

<p>For all the London and Kent routes I took South Western trains, TfL services, or High Speed 1.</p>
<p>The best sections were from Battersea Power Station to Greenwich: you get far more diversity in the built environment on this leg than any other section of the Thames (beyond these points London is mostly just suburbs).</p>

<li><a href="/gpx/The_Thames_8_N_Canvey_Island_Loop.gpx">[8/20] Canvey Island (23.6km)</a>: I ran a lap of Canvey Island because I‚Äôm followed by a group of pedants on Strava who would‚Äôve called me out if I skipped it.</li>
<li><a href="/gpx/The_Thames_9_N_Benfleet_to_Southend_on_Sea_completed_the_tidal_Thames_.gpx">[9/20] Benfleet to Southend-on-Sea (12km)</a>: I concluded I‚Äôd reached the end of the Thames when I reached a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Stone_(riparian)">London Stone</a> at Chalkwell, which marks the end of the Port of London‚Äôs Authority. However I continued to Southend-on-Sea because I figured if they‚Äôre claiming it‚Äôs at the seaside rather than the estuary-side that was good enough for me. Finished with fish and chips and ice cream on the beach.</li>

Although it felt delightfully old-fashioned to cross the river by ringing a bell to call the ferryman, it was still 2023 so he took Apple Pay.</li>
<li><a href="/gpx/The_Thames_11_N_Chertsey_to_Windsor.gpx">[11/20] Chertsey to Windsor (22.4km)</a>: Ran past Runnymede, shortly before Windsor Castle, which was the site of the signing of the Magna Carta in 1215.

<li><a href="/gpx/The_Thames_13_N_Bourne_End_to_Henley_on_Thames.gpx">[13/20] Bourne End to Henley-on-Thames (20.7km)</a>: Lots of pleasant countryside but the path I plotted often took me up over hills and away from the Thames.

<li><a href="/gpx/The_Thames_15_N_Pangbourne_to_Wallingford_and_Chorley_.gpx">[15/20] Pangbourne to Wallingford (25.1km)</a>: I ran a lot of this on <a href="https://www.nationaltrail.co.uk/en_GB/trails/the-ridgeway/">The Ridgeway</a> rather than the Thames Path. I originally plotted this route with a plan to take a train back from Wallingford Station ‚Ä¶ only to discover it was a heritage station with <em>very</em> infrequent services so afterwards I looped back and took a train back to London from nearby Chorley.</li>

The Thames Path crosses the river at Benson Lock but at the time the footbridge was closed; a ferry operated across the river instead. I suffered my worst hay fever reaction ever towards the end of this run so my pace dropped completely and I walked the last few kilometers back to Radley, where I then took a train to Oxford and another back to London.</li>

I‚Äôd argue these are the last tourist attractions on the run: the remainder is all through countryside and very small towns. I had virtually no service for the second half of the run which made navigating back to Oxford a bit of a challenge; I eventually walked to the A420 and got a local bus back.</li>
<li><a href="/gpx/The_Thames_18_N_Bablock_Hythe_to_Lechlade.gpx">[18/20] Bablock Hythe to Lechlade (33.1km)</a>: The Thames Path switches to the opposite side of the river between Bablock Hythe and Appleton. I believe <a href="https://theferrymaninn.co.uk">the pub at Bablock Hythe</a> operates a ferry service, but at the time I was running it was closed. I therefore took a taxi from Oxford to start this run. St John‚Äôs Lock is the final (or first!) lock on the river, about a kilometer downstream from Lechlade. At Lechlade I took a local bus to Swindon and trains back from there.</li>

The Thames Path hugged the river tightly but my route deviated slightly from it. The only challenge I had was when I encountered a herd of cows that took a little too much interest in me for my liking ‚Ä¶ the correct solution was <em>not</em> to climb through a barbed wire fence but instead to walk around them calmly, which I unfortunately learned the hard way.</p>
<p>By May the spring at Thames Head had dried up, but I instead found the spring that was the current source of the Thames tucked away in some woodland between the A433 and the A429. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend doing what I did, which was to wade through the Thames (it was only a few centimeters deep here!), cut myself on a whole bunch of brambles, and then get stung by a bunch of stinging nettles to find it. But on the other hand there was no chance I was going to run 400km and <em>not</em> find the start.</p>
<p>I continued on to Thames Head, the traditional start of the river and of the Thames Path. There I met a friendly group of walkers and runners, most of whom were about to set off down the path in the opposite direction. I considered getting a pint in at the Thames Head Inn nearby, but instead opted to avoid train delays and cancellations so I caught the train back to London from Kemble.</p></li>

<p>The final obvious question: ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs next?‚Äù ‚Ä¶ A break?! The lesson from this project has been that I don‚Äôt mind travel for runs, just so long as the travel doesn‚Äôt take significantly more time than the run itself. That said, I‚Äôve definitely got a couple more daft projects in the pipeline‚Ä¶</p>

It should be as easy to block someone as it is to follow them. It would make a statement to trolls and users alike. To users it would say that blocking is a common thing, don't think about it too much, and certainly don't be intimidated into not doing it. It must be almost as easy to undo. A command to review the list of recent blocks. Facebook comes closest to this. It is very easy to block an account but not quite this easy. I think they're probably heading there.

## 25. Borg backups

date: 2024-05-19, from: Blair's Science Desk

I haven&rsquo;t posted here in a while! Today, I thought I&rsquo;d get back in the habit by posting my Borg backup script. Borg is a command-line backup app written in Python. It&rsquo;s blazing fast and features great de-duplication.
To get started with Borg, follow the installation instructions here.
Then, initialize a backup with this command:
borg init /path/to/backup Here&rsquo;s my backup script. First we make a backup of my /home directory:
