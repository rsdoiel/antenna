## SimpliSafe Video Doorbell: Halt and Catch Fire

date: 2024-02-01, from: Jeff Geerling blog

<span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">SimpliSafe Video Doorbell: Halt and Catch Fire</span>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/simplisafe-video-doorbell-burnt-wires.jpg" width="700" height="auto" class="insert-image" alt="SimpliSafe Video Doorbell Pro burnt wires" /></p>

<p>This SimpliSafe doorbell burned up less than a week after I installed it. I never would've thought a doorbell would be the most dangerous thing I set up at my studio!</p>

<p>I learned a LOT about powering 'smart' doorbells, and talked directly to SimpliSafe about it. They did sent a replacement, but it has it's own problems.</p>

<p>I'm still happy with SimpliSafe overall, but I don't like how I've spent about 8 hours troubleshooting a 'smart' doorbell. The only thing that's been 100% reliable on this thing is the basic ding dong I could've gotten with a <a href="https://amzn.to/4987S9w">five dollar dumb doorbell</a>!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This blog post is based off my latest moving vlog, episode 12, where I talk about my SimpliSafe doorbell problems, the new 10G and 25G networking gear I'm testing, and a new 'retro corner' in my office. Check it out below:</p></blockquote></div>

## Google to optionally ingest your Google Messages history into its “AI”

date: 2024-01-31, from: OS News

Researchers have just unveiled a pre-release, game-changing AI upgrade for Google Messages. But it’s one with a serious privacy risk—it seems that Bard may ask to read and analyze your private message history. So how might this work, how do you maintain your privacy, and when might this begin. ↫ Zak Doffman As long as this &#8220;AI&#8221; hoovering is an optional &#8216;feature&#8217;, I don&#8217;t really have any issues with it &#8211; it&#8217;s a free world, and if you want to spice up your autocomplete like this, go ahead. The real danger, of course, is that this won&#8217;t be optional for long, and eventually Google&#8217;s &#8220;AI&#8221; will just ingest your messages and emails by default, consent or no.

With both mistrust in media and AI-generated news on the rise, The New York Times has rolled out new byline pages that emphasize the ethical guidelines and real-life humans behind its reporting. We&#8217;ve covered the expanded bylines and datelines that&#8217;ve previously come from the news org&#8217;s cross-functional trust team. Now, the Times has rolled out hundreds...

MariaDB 11.4 has a new feature: CREATE PACKAGE with routine syntax for the default mode as opposed to sql_mode=&#8217;Oracle&#8217;.

## IndieWeb Carnival: Digital Relationships

date: 2024-01-31, from: Manu - I write blog

<p>January is about to end. That means that January’s IndieWeb Carnival, hosted by <a href="https://foreverliketh.is">foreverliketh.is</a>, is also about to end. If you want to submit your entry on the topic of <a href="https://foreverliketh.is/blog/indieweb-carnival-january-2024-positive-internalization/">Positive Internalization</a> you should hurry up.</p>
<p>As mentioned previously on this blog I’m going to host the next month and the topic for the month of February is going to be “Digital relationships”. The meaning of the topic is intentionally vague but I can think of at least three ways to interpret it.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The first is probably the most obvious: relationships between us human beings that are lived primarily—or entirely—on the digital world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second is the relationship between us and the digital world itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The third is the growing trend of people having relationships with digital creations such as AI fiends, boyfriends and girlfriends.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are three ways you can interpret the topic but don’t feel limited to just those three. Go nuts and be creative. This site doesn’t have pingbacks or webmentions so if you plan to participate send me a link to your entry via email. I’m going to accept everything that’s sent to me before March 1st and I plan to write at least one roundup post with your links. Look forward to read your entries and don’t forget to spread the word about the IndieWeb Carnival and if you want to get involved you can still become a host yourself. Just claim your spot here <a href="https://indieweb.org/indieweb-carnival">indieweb.org/indieweb-carnival</a></p>

As I was writing the post about using ChatGPT to port Frontier, which is a C program, runs on Mac and Windows, GPL licensed, to Linux. This took me to an interesting place.

## Some activities are harder than others

date: 2024-01-31, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1>Some activities are harder than others</h1>

<p>Or, why <a href="2022-03-04_It_is_not_too_late_to_bake_bread">baking bread</a> is easy compared to many other activities.</p>

<p>A recent conversation with <a class="account" href="https://zirk.us/@Mayobrot" title="@Mayobrot@zirk.us">@Mayobrot</a> made me think about the fear of doing things. I&rsquo;m thinking that there are activities that are inherently easier to perform than others because of the natural environment. In speaking about them, however, we use categories that do not differentiate between the two and so we transfer our fears from one category to the other.</p>

<p>Here are some examples from my personal life: I think programming and soldering and model planes are difficult activities because small differences have big impacts. On the other hand, cooking or baking, or taking care of plants are comparatively easy activities because small differences often don&rsquo;t have a large impact.</p>

<p>Take the question of how long you should bake bread. In my oven, with my settings, it seems that anything between 30 min and 90 min results in edible bread. The temperature can vary between 160°C and 220°C and if I&rsquo;m looking into the oven every now and then this results in edible bread. Varying ingredients by ±10% and more results in edible bread.</p>

<p>The same is true for watering plants, potting plants and all that connects to. Plants adapt. Errors don&rsquo;t accumulate but instead they average out. To much or too little water means it&rsquo;s going to be OK on average.</p>

<p>This is not how software works. Its bugs bugs bugs and they never average out to a nice user experience.</p>

<p>When family asks me about bugs in programming, I tell them that the problem is that we need to put everything into the program: gravity, air resistance, the floor… In real life we don&rsquo;t. Walking is easy because if we push of harder we don&rsquo;t yeet ourselves into the sun. We just bounce a little higher and then we&rsquo;re back on the ground. And we don&rsquo;t fall towards the centre of the Earth as in some 3d model glitch in a game. No, the ground is always there. If we speed up, there&rsquo;s friction to slow us down again. So physics stabilizes many things.</p>

<p>Chemistry stabilizes many things, too. If we use up the oxygen in our room, we don&rsquo;t just go go go and then we die because the oxygen concentration goes down slowly. We get less oxygen, we move slower, we have more time to get out.</p>

<p>And biology stabilizes things, too. We call it homeostasis. You exercise, burning up sugar. Sugar goes down, fat gets mobilized, allowing your body to continue. And then there are a hundred feedback loops for everything to keep your body from falling apart. Of course eventually we all do, but still.</p>

<p>I guess what I really was trying to say is that there are some activities like baking bread that seem hard because you think that baking bread is probably related to model air-planes and if you struggle with the tweezers and glue and all that, surely you will struggle with the ingredients of that dish, too. But that is not so. Usually, you can mess up ingredients pretty badly and results are still edible, or even tasty! They might not be repeatable, but who cares if you&rsquo;re not a chef in a restaurant. It&rsquo;s tasty and you eat it. It&rsquo;s great.</p>

## OSC52: My Cut & Paste Journey

date: 2024-01-31, from: Miek Giebin blog

In the olden days with X11, you could just do x11-forwarding in SSH and remote cut and paste would work. Now with Wayland, this is all broken and supposedly &ldquo;there are better ways of doing it&rdquo;. One of those is OSC52 support in terminals, but not in VTE based ones, like Tilix, which is was my default terminal. (See https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/vte/-/issues/2495 for the 5(!) year old bug).
So I wanted this to work, which meant changing terminal and configuring Neovim - where the latter was way more complex, hard to debug and reason about.

## PgBouncer 1.22.0 released

date: 2024-01-31, from: PostgreSQL News

<p>PgBouncer 1.22.0 has been released. The main feature this release adds is
support for the <code>DISCARD ALL</code> and <code>DEALLOCATE ALL</code> commands when enabling
prepared statement support in transaction pooling mode (by setting
<code>max_prepared_statements</code> to a non-zero value). This is an important improvement
in the prepared statement support that clears the road for us to be able to
enable prepared statement support by default in a future release.</p>
<p>Other than that this release contains some small improvements and bugfixes,
including improvements to our recommended SystemD configuration files.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://www.pgbouncer.org/2024/01/pgbouncer-1-22-0">https://www.pgbouncer.org/2024/01/pgbouncer-1-22-0</a> for more information, the detailed changelog, and download links.</p>

Since the last news post on our progress, there have several major accomplishments and many smaller ones. Forgive us if a few are left out.

## Patriotism in popular music

date: 2024-01-30, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1>Patriotism in popular music</h1>

<p>Patriotism is a terrible topic for a song. That’s what makes me cringe when I listen to Preciosa Puerto Rico by Marc Anthony. But when that tempo change in the middle around the 3min mark comes up, it just makes me want to get up and shout with jubilation! It is only later that I wonder: what if this had been a German singing about Germany (substitute your own boogeyman). 😩</p>

<p>I am convinced: patriotism is an illusion used to achieve something. It might be something good, a national infrastructure project, but inevitably it will be used for evil. But that song … ah, it melts my heart!</p>

<p>Beware small-patriotism. It starts with homesickness, longing for the places and culture you grew up in, which is valid, no doubt, but when you add pride or that feeling of belonging to the mix, it starts getting tricky. Who decides who belongs?</p>

<p>As a perpetual foreigner, that feeling of belonging always comes with an exclusionary element, in my experience. The Swiss celebrate Switzerland, and their independence from the Austrians and the Germans. The Austrians celebrate Austria and think that the Slovenian road names have to go. There&rsquo;s always somebody on the other side of the fence. But I know relatives in Portugal, France, Germany, Austria, Croatia, and there are more relatives that I haven&rsquo;t met. So yes, there can be as moment of pride for living in a place where this or that works well, or where the landscape is beautiful, or where you feel the people are nice, or the food is good, a moment where you&rsquo;re not thinking too hard about it all – but that moment is fleeting, and the abyss is huge. Patriotism and nationalism are not only about that fleeting moment.</p>

## Raspberry Pi is planning a London IPO, but its CEO expects “no change” in focus

CEO Eben Upton tells Ars that should the IPO happen, it will let Raspberry Pi&#8217;s not-for-profit side expand by &#8220;at least a factor of 2X.&#8221; And while it&#8217;s &#8220;an understandable thing&#8221; that Raspberry Pi enthusiasts could be concerned, &#8220;while I&#8217;m involved in running the thing, I don&#8217;t expect people to see any change in how we do things.&#8221; ↫ Kevin Purdy at Ars Technica Expect changes in how they do things.

## Apple Vision Pro review: magic, until it’s not

date: 2024-01-30, from: OS News

A number of reviews for Apple&#8217;s new VR headset have been published, but the only one I think is worth reading is, surprisingly, the one published by The Verge. Both the written and video review are excellent, and go into every possible little detail of the new device. Nilay Patel concludes: The basic gist is that the Vision Pro is simply cumbersome and unpleasant to use, exactly what many people have been suspecting since the day it was unveiled. I&#8217;ve been asking a very simple question on Mastodon nobody has been able to answer yet: is there anything you do on your phone, laptop, or desktop, that the Vision Pro can do better, easier, quicker? Now that the reviews are here, not even the people using it can provide an answer. And think about that last point in the list above. It&#8217;s a private computer that&#8217;s always looking at your hands.

## The Garrison Project wants to bridge the gap between national and local criminal justice reporting

The Garrison Project is not your standard digital news organization. It&#8217;s produced a total of 48 stories about criminal justice issues in a bit more than two years — hardly the publishing pace of a typical startup. You can read those articles on its website, but their presence there feels almost perfunctory. It produces local...

## Best laptop of 2024

date: 2024-01-30, from: Manu - I write blog

<p>You might be confused by the title of this post. You might be wondering why on earth am I writing about the best laptop of 2024. I never reviewed products on this blog. There was no best laptop of 2023 post nor a best laptop of 2022. And fear not, there won’t be a post about the best laptop of 2024 either.</p>
<p>You see, this is not going to be a post about laptops. It’s going to be a post about words, about generated content, and about SEO. It’s also going to be an experiment because I’m a curious person and the inner workings of search engines fascinate me.</p>
<p>I was listening to a tech podcast the other day and in it, they were talking about the evolving landscape of the publishing industry with the increasing trend of companies making AI-generated listicles in an attempt to rank high on Google. And then you have things like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/28/24053882/arc-search-browser-web-app-ios">Arc search browser</a> that will use Ai to generate summaries of the pages they browsed on your behalf. The result is that you have Ai consuming content written by Ai in an attempt to do... something? I’m not sure what the end game is to be perfectly honest with you but I’m interested because this all looks like a shit show.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to the best laptops of 2024. In that podcast, they mentioned that one of the prime targets in the search results tech space is, you guessed it, the first page of results for the query “best laptops of 2024”. And while I was listening I thought “I wonder how high can a stupid blog post get on that SERP if I don’t actually write content that’s relevant to the query”.</p>
<p>And this is that post. I have no interest in laptops. I know nothing about laptops. I don’t care about laptops. I don’t even know which laptops came out in 2024. I do know people are interested in knowing which laptop is the best laptop in 2024 which is why I just wasted some of your time (I’m sorry) making you read a silly post about the best laptops in 2024 that has nothing to do with laptops.</p>
<p>Will google pick this one up? Will I even reach the first page? Who knows! But if for some reason you landed on this blog post searching for the best laptop of 2024 send me an email. I promise you I’ll do my best to help you figure out what’s the best laptop for you.</p>

## Which self is this?

date: 2024-01-30, from: Rachel Kwon blog

Last month Katherine called out the tension inherent in a &ldquo;personal&rdquo; website which is that it is both public and personal, and one&rsquo;s public (or professional) persona is often different from that of their personal life. Robin Rendle riffed on the concept and said that it&rsquo;s totally fine for personal websites to be messy or imperfect or weird (i.e., not necessarily how you&rsquo;d want to present a &ldquo;professional&rdquo; front) and declared, in a pretty great and punchy/pithy statement, &ldquo;You’re a poem and not software&rdquo;.

## THE THUNDERBOLT

date: 2024-01-30, from: Howard Jacobson blog

As a love-token to my readers here are the first few pages of my new novel which is published on Feb 1 DAY ONE Kerpow! Funny - unless it&#8217;s ominous - she had put that very word down on a Scrabble board only a day or two or before. Jubilant, the k scoring triple. Her opponent - the man she had known for over twenty years, slept with for five, no longer slept with with for however many more that left, and now played Scrabble with instead - contested the spelling. Kapow, yes. Kerpow, no. They fought over it. Have it your way, she said in the end. Which meant she had to remove a garment.

As you might expect, the most common answer was the network I was asking on (except Facebook, no one answered there, I guessed that might happen, because Facebook is different from the others). I asked because I'm trying to figure that out for myself, and I'm kind of disappointed that I find myself going to Threads more often. It has the greater <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Sweaty+Palms+Quotient">Sweaty Palms Quotient</a>, the feeling I used to have every week in the 80s when MacWeek or PC Week arrived. I always cleared the time to go through each issue carefully to see what my friends and competitors were up to. Then I would talk to my reporter friends, who wanted to know what I thought, or what back-room perspectives I could share with them. This was the time of the telephone, even before everyone had email, in the tech industry, believe it or not. Anyway, this isn't going the way I hoped it would. For me an open network built on the idea of <a href="https://textcasting.org/">textcasting</a> is what I want to see, what I'm working towards. And seeing products like WordPress and its competitors as full-class members of the social web, because they already do textcasting, now all they need is to be hooked up to a social web that understands that writing isn't just <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+grunts+and+snorts">grunts and snorts</a>. Anyway, it'll give you some encouragement that people in the fediverse are most optimistic about their preferred network being the best of the new lot. I still like Bluesky, a lot, because of the intelligence and creativity of the people who use it. And I like the UI, for its simplicity and familiarity, but I'm concerned it'll lose its simplicity when they federate. And don't count Twitter out yet, there's far more happening there than any of the other networks. And a lot of what you read on the other nets  is wishful thinking about the demise of Twitter. Hasn't happened yet, and my guess is it won't. It's really hard to snuff out machines with the kind of momentum Twitter has, even though Musk is doing his best. One more thing to think about, I don't think federation is what we need, I think we need <a href="http://scripting.com/2014/03/21/theWebIsMadeOfInterop.html">interop</a>. It's a more permissive kind of compatibility, and will happen a lot sooner than federation, which honestly, I don't think ever will happen. With the usual disclaimers, most important that I'm often wrong, and am open to other constructive points of view.

## Hubble Spies a Spinning Spiral

date: 2024-01-30, from: NASA breaking news

Looking like a baseball lobbed into the depths of the universe, ESO 420-G013 is a face-on spiral galaxy and a Seyfert galaxy. Dark lanes of dust are visible against the background glow of the galaxy’s many stars.  About 10 percent of all the galaxies in the universe are thought to be Seyfert galaxies. They are […]

## iPhone ProRes Log in Peru and Taiwan

date: 2024-01-30, from: Stu Maschwitz blog

<iframe scrolling="no" allowfullscreen src="//www.youtube.com/embed/yFm-tLrQ8ZQ?wmode=opaque" width="854" frameborder="0" height="480"></iframe>

<p>This is a blog post about a video, which is about new color-conversion LUTs for Apple Log footage from the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max (updated from my <a href="https://prolost.com/blog/applelog">first set</a>). The video is also a mini-travelogue of my recent trips to Taiwan and Peru. This post dives a bit deeper into both the LUT workflows, and my state of mind about shooting digital-cinema-grade footage with a device I always have with me.</p><p>There’s a lot going on here.</p>

<p>I always have a moment when packing for a trip: Which camera to bring? Which lenses? I know I’m always happier when I pack less, like just a single prime lens. But sometimes FOMO gets me and I pack three zooms.</p>
<p>For my trip to Lima, I brought my <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1645238-REG/sony_ilce7rm4a_b_alpha_a7r_iv_mirrorless.html/BI/4778/KBID/5292">Sony a7RIV</a> with the uninspiring-but-compact, <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1008123-REG/sony_sel35f28z_sonnar_t_fe_35mm.html/BI/4778/KBID/5292">Sony 35mm F2.8 prime</a>. I lugged it around for a few days, but wasn’t really feeling it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, my iPhone 15 Pro Max was calling to me with its ProRes Log video mode. “I’m 10-bit!” It would say. “Think of the fun you’ll have color grading me!”</p>
<p>I told my phone to shut up, and proceeded to shoot very little with it — or my Sony. Like a squirrel in the middle of the street, drawn in two different directions at once, I creatively froze.</p>
<p>Photography, for me, is made up of a lot of habits, and shooting iPhone video with aesthetic intent is just not yet baked into my travel muscle memory.</p>
<h2 id="made-in-taiwan">Made in Taiwan</h2>
<p>A month later, I took a family trip to Taiwan, one of my favorite places in the world. I’d had some time to process my Peru deadlock, and decided to stop judging my own creative impulses, and let inspiration guide me in which camera I pulled out.</p>
<p>I wound up shooting a lot of video.</p>

<p>I <em>loved</em> shooting ProRes Log in Taiwan with the iPhone 15 Pro Max. I’d occasionally reach for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blackmagic-camera/id6449580241">Blackmagic Camera</a>, but I often just used the default camera app. I stuck my phone (with its <a href="https://www.threads.net/@prolost/post/C0VGQ8gPPyU">crumbling case</a>) out of taxi sunroofs and skyscraper windows, held it above teeming crowds and shoved it between chain-link fences. Seeing the broad dynamic range I was capturing in scenarios from noontime sun to neon-lit nights got me excited about grading the footage later.</p>
<p>It’s exactly the way I feel about shooting raw stills with my Sony, knowing that I’ll be able to go crazy on them in Lightroom. The photographing act is just half of the process.</p>

<h2 id="luts-looks-and-magic-bullets">LUTs, Looks, and Magic Bullets</h2>
<p>There’s been a bit of a gold rush of people hawking creative LUTs that apply a particular “look” to iPhone Log footage. My day job is, in part, helping make color tools like <a href="https://www.maxon.net/en/red-giant/magic-bullet/looks">Magic Bullet Looks</a>, which can do so much more than any LUT. Creative LUTs are great, and by all means support the folks making them — but that’s not what my iPhone LUTs <a href="https://prolost.com/blog/applelog">were</a> or are.</p>
<p>The Prolost iPhone LUTs convert Apple Log to various other color spaces, and support three kinds of workflow:</p>
<h3 id="grade-under-a-display-transform-lut">Grade Under a Display Transform LUT</h3>
<p>Apple Log is a totally decent color space to work in, so color correcting Apple Log can be as simple as applying <a href="https://www.maxon.net/en/red-giant/magic-bullet/colorista">Magic Bullet Colorista</a> and choosing one of my <strong>Monitor &amp; Grade</strong> LUTs. That’s what you see me doing in the video above. Colorista (set to Log mode) does its work on the native Apple Log pixels, and the LUT converts the result to look nice on video.</p>
<p>Many other systems work like this, including <a href="https://luma-touch.com">LumaFusion</a>, which <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLtNJ8DbQrQ">ships with</a> Prolost Apple Log LUTs.</p>
<p>The key is <a href="https://prolost.com/blog/applelog">color correcting under the LUT</a>.</p>
<h3 id="bring-apple-log-into-an-existing-workflow">Bring Apple Log into an Existing Workflow</h3>
<p>Color work is often done in an intermediate color space. This is usually some kind of wide-gamut, log format, such as Davinci Wide Gamut/Intermediate, or one of the <a href="https://prolost.com/blog/aces">ACES log spaces</a>.</p>
<p>The Prolost <strong>ACES</strong> LUTs convert Apple Log to either ACEScc or ACEScct log, allowing you to grade your iPhone footage alongside any other professional camera, and output them all through the same pipeline.</p>
<h3 id="shooting-through-a-lut">Shooting Through a LUT</h3>
<p>The Blackmagic Camera app allows you to load any LUTs you want and preview through them without baking them into your footage. With my LUTs, you can shoot with the same LUTs you grade under later, for a truly professional (no joke!) workflow.</p>
<p>The real stars of this update though are the <strong>FC</strong> LUTs. They add an informative False Color overlay to the Shoot/Grade LUTs, making sure you always nail your exposure. Watch the video to see them in action. I already can’t imagine shooting without them.</p>
<p>These LUTs work well in Blackmagic Camera or even on an external HDMI monitor.</p>

<p>As if this video wasn’t enough work already (I shot the a-roll in mid-December), I decided to use it as a test case for creative editorial in DaVinci Resolve. It’s the ACES LUTs that allowed me to incorporate Magic Bullet Looks into my Resolve color workflow.</p>
<p>Maxon just shipped a really nice <a href="https://www.maxon.net/en/article/maxon-red-giant-update-delivers-fast-beautiful-bokeh-and-realistic-lens-flares">update</a> to Magic Bullet Looks, with simplified color management made possible by more and more apps we support doing darn fine color management at the timeline level.</p>
<p>So in Resolve, I can use my LUT to convert Apple Log to ACEScc, and then apply Magic Bullet Looks, which can now be set to work in ACEScc with a single click.</p>

<p>I can sneak additional Resolve corrector nodes in between those two for local corrections. Resolve is great at this, and Looks is great at creative look development, so this is a match made in heaven.</p>

<h2 id="gear-inspires">Gear Inspires</h2>
<p>Every photographer knows the feeling of lusting after new gear. We know it so well that we remind ourselves constantly that “next camera syndrome” is debilitating, and that “most cameras are better than most photographers.” Gear is not the answer. Go shoot.</p>
<p>There is, however, a counterpoint to these truths: As shooters, we take inspiration where we can get it. And sometimes a new technique, a new locale, or even, yes, a new bit of gear is what provides it.</p>
<p>The key is to listen for that inspiration, and don’t judge it.</p>
<p>Even if it’s coming from your phone.</p>

## Effectual Art

date: 2024-01-30, from: Ayjay blog

David Brooks: “Does consuming art, music, literature and the rest of what we call culture make you a better person?” Answer: No. Consuming art can’t make anyone better. But experiencing art certainly can make you a better person. So can experiencing anything else. It depends on you.  But, okay, there’s more to say. Anything we [&#8230;]

## You say feature, I say bug: the enshittification of Microsoft Paint

date: 2024-01-30, from: John Udell blog

I&#8217;ve happily used MS Paint as my basic bitmap editor since Windows 3, almost 25 years ago. Mostly I&#8217;ve used it to create images from screenshots, but that has suddenly become way harder. Formerly, when I&#8217;d cut a region, the now-empty region would display using the default white background. Now it displays a checkered background &#8230; <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2024/01/29/you-say-feature-i-say-bug-the-enshittification-of-microsoft-paint/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">You say feature, I say bug: the enshittification of Microsoft Paint</span></a>

## Oracle quietly extends Solaris 11.4 support until 2037

date: 2024-01-30, from: OS News

Oracle has quietly extended paid support and upgrades for Solaris 11.4 to 2037 – three years past its previous deadline – and did the same for earlier versions of the OS last year. ↫ Simon Sharwood at The Register One of the biggest &#8220;what could have beens&#8221; of the past two decades. Had Oracle not closed Solaris up after acquiring Sun, an open source Solaris might&#8217;ve been something more tangible than what it is today. Of course, Oracle gonna Oracle and they were always going to screw things up, open source or not, but had Solaris stayed open we&#8217;d have had a more concerted, centralised development effort instead of what we have now, where the open source Solaris community is working off the last OpenSolaris codebase from 14 years ago.

## New renderers for GTK

date: 2024-01-30, from: OS News

Recently, GTK gained not one, but two new renderers: one for GL and one for Vulkan. Since naming is hard, we reused existing names and called them “ngl” and “vulkan”. They are built from the same sources, therefore we also call them “unified” renderers.  As mentioned already, the two renderers are built from the same source. It is modeled to follow Vulkan apis, with some abstractions to cover the differences between Vulkan and GL (more specifically, GL 3.3+ and GLES 3.0+). This lets us share much of the infrastructure for walking the scene graph, maintaining transforms and other state, caching textures and glyphs, and will make it easier to keep both renderers up-to-date and on-par. ↫ GTK Development Blog This is well above my paygrade, but I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s still of interest to y&#8217;all.

## In loving memory of square checkbox

date: 2024-01-30, from: OS News

But despite all this chaos and temptation, operating system vendors knew better. To this day, they follow THE convention: checkboxes are square, radio buttons are round. Maybe it was part of their internal training. Maybe they had experienced art directors. Maybe it was just luck. I don’t know — it doesn’t really matter — but — somehow — they managed to stick to the convention. Until this day. Apple is the first major operating system vendor who had abandoned a four-decades-long tradition. Their new visionOS — for the first time in the history of Apple — will have round checkboxes. ↫ Nikita Prokopov Unsightly. A lack of taste always betrays itself.

## Microsoft stole my Chrome tabs, and it wants yours, too

date: 2024-01-30, from: OS News

Last week, I turned on my PC, installed a Windows update, and rebooted to find Microsoft Edge automatically open with the Chrome tabs I was working on before the update. I don’t use Microsoft Edge regularly, and I have Google Chrome set as my default browser. Bleary-eyed at 9AM, it took me a moment to realize that Microsoft Edge had simply taken over where I’d left off in Chrome. I couldn’t believe my eyes. I never imported my data into Microsoft Edge, nor did I confirm whether I wanted to import my tabs. But here was Edge automatically opening after a Windows update with all the Chrome tabs I’d been working on. I didn’t even realize I was using Edge at first, and I was confused why all my tabs were suddenly logged out. ↫ Tom Warren at The Verge I would never accept such disregard for users from my computer.

## RORing ahead: using ROR in place of the Open Funder Registry

date: 2024-01-30, from: Crossref Blog

<p>A few months ago we announced our plan to <a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/open-funder-registry-to-transition-into-research-organization-registry-ror/">deprecate our support for the Open Funder Registry</a> in favour of using the ROR Registry to support both affiliation and funder use cases. The feedback we’ve had from the community has been positive and supports our members, service providers and metadata users who are already starting to move in this direction.</p>
<p>We wanted to provide an update on work that’s underway to make this transition happen, and how you can get involved in working together with us on this.</p>
<p>Overall, we are building more comprehensive support for ROR into Crossref’s services. Some of this work is specifically to support using ROR to identify funding organisations in place of funder registry IDs. We have a number of parallel, complementary projects underway to support different elements of this work:</p>
<ol>
<li>We are evolving our metadata schema so that we can collect ROR IDs in places where we currently support the collection of Funder IDs.</li>
<li>We are analysing the coverage of Funder ID to ROR ID mappings and testing the way we expose them in our APIs.</li>
<li>We are developing new matching strategies to match text strings to ROR IDs.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="1-schema-updates">1. Schema updates</h2>
<p>Everything flows from being able to get ROR IDs into the Crossref metadata!</p>
<p>We are evolving our metadata schema so that we can collect ROR IDs in places where we already support the collection of Funder IDs – for instance, in <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/funder-registry/funding-data-overview/">the funding section of the metadata for works</a> and in the funder section for grants.</p>
<p>We’re working with members and service providers so that they can try sending us this data via a pipeline our Labs team has built to test schema updates before they go live. We are actively recruiting members to help us test our new pipeline by providing sample XML for registration. Planned metadata inputs and outputs are detailed in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/164h3UtBQ2mHf5lH5ZS6c_Oh8OuraoaQPvXhNNO3-Ko8/edit" target="_blank">Including ROR as a funder identifier in your metadata (metadata prototyping instructions)</a>, we’d encourage you to provide feedback on these in the document, ideally in the next two weeks.
We’re aiming to release an updated schema that supports these changes in Q1 2024.</p>
<h2 id="2-modelling-ror-idfunder-id-mappings-in-our-metadata-model">2. Modelling ROR ID/Funder ID mappings in our metadata model</h2>
<p>We have integrated the ROR registry into our evolving metadata model, and we have started work to integrate the Funder Registry. The aim is to create more flexibility in how Crossref’s metadata can be supplemented and queried, and give more clarity as to which party asserted or created a metadata element.</p>
<p>We’re working on an early iteration of how the model handles ROR IDs, funder IDs and their equivalencies. Once we have something to share, we’ll welcome community feedback on this approach and on the metadata model in general.</p>
<h2 id="3-developing-new-matching-strategies-to-match-text-strings-to-ror-ids">3. Developing new matching strategies to match text strings to ROR IDs</h2>
<p>Ideally, everyone would always use persistent identifiers to exchange information about contributor and awardee affiliations, organisations related to works, as well as funders supporting the research. In practice, this information is often exchanged as data without identifiers, such as affiliation strings (e.g. “University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA”), funder names, or even funding acknowledgements (e.g. “Funding and support generously provided by the Ford Foundation”). In such situations, a good metadata matching strategy can help map these to persistent identifiers.</p>
<p>Currently, we are focused on developing reliable strategies for matching affiliation strings to ROR IDs. In the future, we will adapt the strategies to support funder names and funding acknowledgements as well. All the strategies will be rigorously evaluated using real-life data. We will make the strategies, as well as the evaluation datasets and evaluation results, publicly available for anyone to use. If you are interested in collaborating on the development or the evaluation of the matching strategies, <a href="mailto:labs@crossref.org">please get in touch</a>!</p>
<p>In the future, we might also apply some of the new matching strategies at Crossref, to the metadata our members send us. This would allow us to insert matched identifiers to the metadata to better connect organisations with other items in the scholarly record. We already have a process that matches the names of funders supporting research against the Funder Registry and enriches the metadata with matched Funder Registry IDs. Developing and evaluating reliable matching strategies will allow us to modify this process to use ROR IDs instead, and extend it to support other use cases, such as contributor affiliations.</p>
<h2 id="what-will-the-transition-mean-for-you">What will the transition mean for you?</h2>
<p>We do recommend that you begin looking at what it will take to integrate ROR into your systems and workflows for identifying funders. Talk to your service providers about this to ready them for this change.
To reiterate the point from the earlier post, in the short term, and even in the medium term, Funder IDs aren’t going away and the Funder IDs will continue to resolve – they are persistent, after all. Eventually, however, the Funder Registry will cease to be updated, so any new funders will only be registrable in Crossref metadata with ROR IDs. Legacy Funder IDs and their mapping to ROR IDs will be maintained, so if Crossref members submit a legacy Funder ID, it will get mapped to a ROR ID automatically. Note, too, that Crossref is committed to maintaining the current funder API endpoints until ROR IDs become the predominant identifier for newly registered content. We also know that there are questions that we’ll want to tackle with the community as we all make progress, some we know and some we don’t know. With that in mind:</p>
<h2 id="tell-us-what-you-need">Tell us what you need!</h2>
<p>We want to hear from you! We have set up several channels of communication meant to ensure that you can tell both ROR and Crossref what will make this transition easier for you and that you can get answers to your questions.</p>
<p>First, we are conducting a series of Open Funder Registry user interviews designed to deepen our understanding of where Funder IDs are being used in workflows and systems. Write <a href="mailto:community@ror.org">community@ror.org</a> if you&rsquo;d like to participate in these interviews to show and tell us how you&rsquo;re using Funder IDs.</p>
<p>Second, in 2024, we will be running a follow-up to the funding data workshop we ran in June 2023. Please get in touch if your organisation would be interested in participating in the discussion.</p>

## Contexts, Friction and Distractions

date: 2024-01-30, from: Marginallia log

I get significantly more work done when I unplug my computer from the Internet. It&rsquo;s not that my productive output drops to zero when I&rsquo;m plugged in, but more like 70%.
Despite many of the tools that I use requiring a connection, and certainly the Internet containing a wealth of information that might expedite my work, these benefits are drastically outweighed by the wealth of distractions also available.
It&rsquo;s very appealing, when the code is compiling or the docker containers restarting, to sneak open a browser tab with hacker news, or the Χ formerly known as Twitter, youtube, or something else to pass those minutes.

## Credcheck version 2.4 released

date: 2024-01-30, from: PostgreSQL News

<p>Grenoble - January 30, 2024</p>
<h2>PostgreSQL credcheck extension</h2>
<p>The credcheck PostgreSQL extension provides few general credential checks, which will be evaluated during the user creation, during the password change and user renaming. By using this extension, we can define a set of rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>allow a specific set of credentials</li>
<li>reject a certain type of credentials</li>
<li>deny password that can be easily cracked</li>
<li>enforce use of an expiration date with a minimum of day for a password</li>
<li>define a password reuse policy</li>
<li>define the number of authentication failure allowed before a user is banned</li>
<li>add a delay after all authentication failure</li>
</ul>
<p>This release is a maintenance release to fix a major issue with the backup of the
password history file with pgBackRest and adds an authentication delay feature.</p>
<ul>
<li>Add authentication delay feature to be able to add a pause on authentication
    failure. Setting <code>credcheck.auth_delay_ms</code> causes the server to pause for a
    given number of milliseconds before reporting authentication failure. This
    makes brute-force attacks on database passwords more difficult.
    This patch is purely a copy/paste from the auth_delay extension just to limit the
    number of extensions to preload. See https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/auth-delay.html
    for more information about the origin of this feature.</li>
<li>Force size of file <code>$PGDATA/global/pg_password_history</code> to be a multiple of 8192
    to fix pgBackRest error caused by the error message: "page misalignment in file
    /.../global/pg_password_history: file size 2604 is not divisible by page size 8192"</li>
</ul>
<p>Extension upgrade requires a PostgreSQL restart to reload the credcheck library.</p>

## pgDay Paris 2024: Schedule published &amp; Call for lightning talks launched

date: 2024-01-30, from: PostgreSQL News

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>The schedule for pgDay Paris 2024 on March 14 is now live and we are really excited to share it with you. We have some great talks lined up for you about everything Postgres - from Codd to community and from logical decoding to LSM trees.</p>
<p>Check out the programme &amp; register now <a href="https://www.postgresql.eu/events/pgdayparis2024/schedule">https://www.postgresql.eu/events/pgdayparis2024/schedule</a></p>
<p>But that’s not all!</p>
<p>The best news is that there’s still a chance for <strong>you</strong> to be on stage! If you look at the schedule, you’ll notice we reserved a slot for lightning talks because we know how much everyone loves them. We also know how nerve-wracking it can be to sign up on the day and not know until the last minute whether or not you’ll be speaking, so we’ve decided to launch a separate lightning talk CFP. Whether you’re a seasoned speaker or you’ve never been up on stage before, and whatever your Postgres use-case, we want to hear from you!</p>
<p>Submissions (max 1 per speaker) should be sent by email to lightning@pgday.paris.</p>
<p>The talk must be in English and no longer than 5 minutes.</p>
<p>The subject of your email should be your name followed by the title of the talk (e.g. “Slonik: What Elephants do for Fun”). The body of the email should contain a very short description of your talk (max 50 words)</p>
<p>We recommend you submit your lightning talk by 23 February as that's when we'll do the first round of selections, with selected speakers notified by 8 March. You can, however, submit your lightning talk right up until the day of the conference in case slots are still available </p>
<p>We look forward to seeing you in Paris on March 14, 
The pgDay Paris Team</p>

## At last, browser choice*

date: 2024-01-29, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24050478/apple-ios-17-4-browser-engines-eu">EU Digital Markets Act is making waves in the Apple ecosystem</a>. For the first time ever you’ll be able to install a browser other than Safari/Webkit on iOS (as long as you live in the EU). While there are other browsers on the iOS App Store, they’re all Safari/Webkit under the hood due to non-competitive App Store submission guidelines.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://open-web-advocacy.org/">Open Web Advocacy</a> group have spent years documenting the issues at hand. I haven’t participated much there, but I’ve built countless web apps and have felt most (if not all) the pain points that come with supporting Safari users and, as a Mobile Safari user, not having access to features I’ve built. That feature gap has closed considerably in the last couple years and the Safari/Webkit team’s movement is impressive, their relative openness on issues is welcome, and <a href="https://webkit.org/standards-positions/">declaring standards positions</a> reduces risk and removes mystery. But this (potentially) blows the doors open on competition.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see what happens from here. Will we break out of the Chromium/Webkit duopoly? Or will we fall headlong into a Chromium monopoly? Regardless, the EU ruling is a win for the Open Web because now users have options beyond the OS-provided default browser. Before there was nothing beyond a thin veneer of choice.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, there are <a href="https://cloudfour.com/thinks/this-web-page-is-best-viewed-in-the-eu/">some questions on how to test this</a> if you don’t live in the EU and it’s not yet known if (or ever) the rest of the world might also get access to other browsers. And there seems to be some malicious compliance afoot… but hopefully over time the situation normalizes towards the ideal outcome; an unfettered web.</p>
<p>Next, if the EU could fix the GDPR banners that are killing the web, that would be wonderful.</p>

## Fossil Is Quitting Smartwatches

## An inbox full o’ opportunities

date: 2024-01-29, from: Dave Rupert blog

<browser-window shadow grayscale>
<div class="post-content">
<p>Hi Dave Rupert LLC,</p>
<p>I liked your latest blog post <a href="https://daverupert.com/2023/08/quick-thoughts-on-chips/">Quick toughts on chips</a> and see you are a business leader in accessibility, Doritos®, and Jekyll blogging software. I thought we should connect. I would like to inform you of an exciting opportunity.</p>
<p>I scraped or stole your email address from some list that you never signed up for, but would you like help growing your company’s sales? I can do the same impersonal, unsolicited, scumbag sales shit I’m doing to you right now but on behalf of your company.</p>
<p>I generated this with AI, so it took me literally no time or effort but I sent it anyways. The federal crime I just committed is utterly offensive and every time I send this to you under a different fake business name you instantly delete it, but some might also call it “innovative”. I can provide this service for your company. Reach new customers today by deploying large scale AI-driven spam operations.</p>
<p>I clearly have no ethics, but you should enter a business relationship with me, a guy who found your email on the internet.</p>
<p>You are now signed up for a no-opt-out email drip campaign to send you automated replies every day for the next week to get you to reply. Reply and start a conversation with your harasser if you’d like it to stop.</p>
<p>Also, would you like to have my boss on your podcast? He’s a B2B Growth Saas Fortune Trope 500 Under 500 Startups Entreprenuer and has a red Porsche. There’s almost no trace of this guy on the internet but you should absolutely have him on your super niche web development podcast. I think he’d be a great fit for your audience.</p>
<p>What do you say? Are you ready to increase the size of your revenue?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Helen</p>

This article will discuss securing your phone after you&#8217;ve rooted it and installed your preferred os (it will not discuss how to root your phone or change the OS). Re-securing your phone requires the installation of a custom AVB key, which not all phones support, so I&#8217;ll only be discussing Google Pixel phones (which support [&#8230;]

## NASA’s Webb Depicts Staggering Structure in 19 Nearby Spiral Galaxies

date: 2024-01-29, from: NASA breaking news

It’s oh-so-easy to be absolutely mesmerized by these spiral galaxies. Follow their clearly defined arms, which are brimming with stars, to their centers, where there may be old star clusters and – sometimes – active supermassive black holes. Only NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope can deliver highly detailed scenes of nearby galaxies in a combination […]

## Disinformation often gets blamed for swaying elections, but the research isn’t so clear

date: 2024-01-29, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

Many countries face general elections this year. Political campaigning will include misleading and even false information. Just days ago, it was reported that a robocall impersonating U.S. president Joe Biden had told recipients not to vote in the presidential primary. But can disinformation significantly influence voting? There are two typical styles of election campaigning. One...

## Berlin School

date: 2024-01-29, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1>Berlin School</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;m listening to <a href="https://yt.cdaut.de/watch?v=BE8rMsM3zLs">Berlin Schoool: An Uncomplicated Approach</a> by Synth Seeker because <a class="account" href="https://social.sdf.org/@phf" title="@phf@social.sdf.org">@phf</a> recommended it.</p>

<p>We were talking about music. All I do is create small jingles for my podcast but every now and then I wonder about music theory.
A while ago I had saved <a href="https://yewtu.be/watch?v=rgaTLrZGlk0">Learn music theory in half an hour</a> by Andrew Huang to get back to it.
But all I had done about it was think to myself: Pick a scale, like this one, B Major looks nice, OK, so full full half full full full half, that’s these keys, OK, let me doodle around on these … beep beep boop boop … here we go. Or maybe do the other one, full full full half full full half … biep biep boup boup … all right! 🥳</p>

<p>But then I wonder: what would my next step be? Some days I look at the circle of fifth and wonder if that’s hogwash. Non-European music doesn&rsquo;t need it! But then again, they also use <em>something</em>. There are rules because people figured out what generally &ldquo;works&rdquo;. Well, on the other hand there are books about many things and they are neither a replacement for spending ten thousand hours practising and the rules they espouse are often just there to get you started and then they are immediately broken.</p>

<p>All I know when I look at a typical drum machine or tracker setup with <sup>8</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> or similar I immediately want to do a <a href="https://babayagamusic.com/Music/nine-eight-rhythms.htm"><sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> Karsilama</a> or something like that. My wife&rsquo;s oriental dancing and all the Turkish, Arab, Iranian and Maghreb music we listened to must have left an impression… Or confused the hell out of me, depending on your perspective. Or mine.</p>

<p>Anyway, writing all of this and I&rsquo;m still not making music. What next, I wonder. Perhaps playing C Major and playing a bunch of notes it shares with another scale and then continuing with that scale is cool. Or maybe not. I don&rsquo;t know. Or just stay in that scale and do some drum machine and patterns below that!</p>

<p>That Synth Seeker video had a link to a <a href="https://www.hooktheory.com/cheat-sheet">Key Cheat Sheet Index</a>. The effect is similar to picking scales in Garage Band or Animoog: limiting the keys I use in order to stay in that scale. Works for me!</p>

<p>All this listening and writing makes me realize that it&rsquo;s Sunday, late at night, I should go to bed, and then I&rsquo;ll be working and playing role-playing games and war-games every evening until the next week-end comes around. Whaaat!</p>

<p>I must find time between the things I do to do the other things.</p>

<p>This is my life.</p>

<p><div class="divInlineImage"><center><img class="imgInline" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/01/29/daveAndDaveOnPotreroHill.png"></center>The Daves (Jacobs and Winer) at a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potrero_Hill">Potrero Hill</a> restaurant in the 90s.</div></p>
<p>We had already been friends for a few years then. By total coincidence we were both offered writing gigs at the then-new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_(magazine)#History">Wired</a>, Dave as the Fetish columnist, where he wrote about all the latest tech gadgetry, which was a perfect assignment for him, because Dave is one of the most tech-literate people you'll ever meet. Also an avid bike rider, Deadhead, and later a receiver of donated kidneys, and a pioneer of the technology for matching kidney donors with recipients. He has saved a lot of lives with his software. And he's still with us, against all odds. </p>
<p>I was offered a column to basically write whatever I wanted to write about, although by default I was supposed to write about the world wide web, which was then as new as ChatGPT is today and every bit as exciting. You can find our respective columns somewhere I hope on the web. </p>
<p>Just chatted with him last night during the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/39413785/niners-beat-lions-nfc-championship-game-reach-super-bowl">Niners game</a>.

## VASL Templates

date: 2024-01-29, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1>VASL Templates</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;m trying to get <a href="https://vasl-templates.org/">VASL Templates</a> to run on my laptop so that I can create nice setups for Advanced Squad Leader. As it turns out, I have to use <code>pipx</code> because that automatically creates virtual environments for me, as far as I understand.</p>

<pre><code>cd src
git clone https://code.pacman-ghost.com/public/vasl-templates.git
cd vasl-templates
pipx install .
</code></pre>

<p>As it turns out, this is not enough:</p>

<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;/home/alex/.local/bin/vasl-templates&quot;, line 5, in &lt;module&gt;
    from vasl_templates.main import main
  File &quot;/home/alex/.local/pipx/venvs/vasl-templates/lib/python3.11/site-packages/vasl_templates/main.py&quot;, line 19, in &lt;module&gt;
    import PyQt5.QtWebEngineWidgets
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'PyQt5'
</code></pre>

<p>So now you need to install PyQt5 into the virtual environment used by vasl-templates:</p>

<pre><code>pipx inject vasl-templates PyQt5
</code></pre>

<p>Next error:</p>

<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;/home/alex/.local/bin/vasl-templates&quot;, line 5, in &lt;module&gt;
    from vasl_templates.main import main
  File &quot;/home/alex/.local/pipx/venvs/vasl-templates/lib/python3.11/site-packages/vasl_templates/main.py&quot;, line 19, in &lt;module&gt;
    import PyQt5.QtWebEngineWidgets
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'PyQt5.QtWebEngineWidgets'
</code></pre>

<p>Fix:</p>

<pre><code>pipx inject vasl-templates PyQtWebEngine
</code></pre>

<p>And now it works at last! 😅</p>

## Config Management

date: 2024-01-29, from: Miek Giebin blog

this project needs a name and a domain.
After many years of playing with YAML in k8s, I&rsquo;ve returned to using CFEngine (at work). The last config management software before that was Puppet. An issue I see with all modern config management tooling is the lack of monitoring and the impossibility to cleanly roll back. In k8s it works better, but that&rsquo;s only for pods running in k8s (which are stateless), not the underlying machines.

## Charlatans spreading misleading beginner advice are the evolutionary crabs of youtube content creators

You have a hobby you&rsquo;ve been into for a decade or more. You like talking about your hobby, and your friends and family, after listening to these things for as long as you&rsquo;ve been into them, maybe aren&rsquo;t as excited to always hear about it as you are about discussing them, so in an act of compassion you create a youtube channel where you can monologue about your passion instead.

## pgEdge Redefines Distributed PostgreSQL with the Launch of pgEdge Cloud Developer Edition

date: 2024-01-29, from: PostgreSQL News

<p>First serverless distributed Postgres managed cloud service delivers low latency and high availability in three minutes or less</p>
<p>Alexandria, Virginia – January 24, 2024 — pgEdge, Inc., the leading company dedicated to distributed Postgres, today announced the launch of pgEdge Cloud Developer Edition, making it easy for developers to deploy and access distributed Postgres databases for low latency and high availability. pgEdge Cloud is the first fully distributed database as a service (DBaaS) optimized for the network edge and based completely on the widely adopted open-source PostgreSQL database. pgEdge Cloud Developer is a generous free tier for developers to rapidly and easily experience the advantages of distributed Postgres.</p>
<p>pgEdge Cloud addresses the growing demand for low-latency and “always on” applications that need to be dispersed across multiple cloud regions. As a fully managed distributed Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS), pgEdge Cloud empowers developers and database architects with an intuitive user interface for creation, management and monitoring of distributed database clusters running across multiple cloud regions.</p>
<p>By putting database nodes closer to global users, pgEdge Cloud can dramatically reduce latency and application response times, particularly page loads for database intensive applications. Additionally, having multiple replicated database nodes across the network ensures high levels of availability, since when a node fails or is not reachable traffic automatically routes to the nearest still available node.</p>
<p>pgEdge Cloud is especially well suited for use with edge development platforms such as Cloudflare Workers, Vercel and Fastly. The ability to place database nodes in multiple regions around the global network, together with automated and seamless nearest-node routing, allow developers to deploy very low latency applications that eliminate slow round trips to a single centrally located database. pgEdge Cloud Developer Edition includes built-in integration for Cloudflare Workers, and support for Vercel and Fastly will be available in coming weeks. An example demonstrating pgEdge Cloud’s ease of integration with Cloudflare is https://github.com/pgEdge/cloudflare-worker-template. Additionally, a demo application running against a distributed version of the well-known “Northwind Traders” database, and implemented with Cloudflare Workers and pgEdge Cloud, is at: https://northwind.pgedge.com/.</p>
<p>Key features of pgEdge Cloud Developer Edition include:</p>
<p>Instant Deployment: Developers can now deploy a globally distributed PostgreSQL serverless database in just a minute, streamlining the database setup process and accelerating development.</p>
<p>Predefined multi-region clusters: Creation and deployment of pgEdge distributed databases is simplified via prebuilt global clusters. Developers can select from a set of predefined multi-region clusters that span the continental US, US and Europe, or US, Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>Multi-Master (Active-Active) Architecture: Each database node can handle both read and write traffic for low latency and high availability, utilizing an eventually consistent multi-master architecture with built in conflict resolution and reporting.</p>
<p>Latency-based DNS Routing: Geo-proximity routing ensures that users are connected to the nearest pgEdge node that is up and running. </p>
<p>Generous Free Tier: Available for prototyping, application development and evaluation of pgEdge capabilities with up to 12GB of storage across three nodes. </p>
<p>Management and Monitoring: Eliminates the need for manual infrastructure configuration and management while providing automated backups, security against misconfiguration, and continuous monitoring via a clean and easy to use web dashboard.</p>
<p>"pgEdge Cloud Developer Edition marks a significant leap in our mission to make it easy for developers to build and deploy highly distributed database applications across the global network," said Phillip Merrick, Co-founder and CEO at pgEdge. "The innovative features of the pgEdge Cloud fully managed service, from multi-region, multi-master support to its intuitive user interface, empower developers to easily create and manage distributed PostgreSQL databases."</p>
<p>Availability</p>
<p>pgEdge Cloud Developer Edition is available today in preview.  Users requiring more resources or capabilities beyond what is offered in the Developer Edition free tier can upgrade to either pgEdge Cloud Team Edition (coming in H1 2024), or pgEdge Cloud Enterprise Edition.</p>
<p>Experience pgEdge Cloud Developer Edition by signing up at www.pgedge.com/get-started/cloud.  To learn more visit www.pgedge.com or join us for an exclusive webinar “Getting to the Low Latency, High Availability Goodness of Distributed Postgres in 3 Minutes or Less” on Wednesday January 31st at 1pm ET https://hubs.la/Q02gBnsh0.

## Resizing macOS app windows for 16:9 screen capture

date: 2024-01-28, from: Jeff Geerling blog

<span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Resizing macOS app windows for 16:9 screen capture</span>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>I frequently need to capture a window of some Mac app for a recording (usually for my YouTube channel), and I've used a little AppleScript I wrote years ago for the purpose.</p>

<p>Somehow, that script (which I saved as a 'one shot' App (<code>.app</code> extension) that just runs then quits) got deleted off my Script Editor folder in my iCloud Drive, so I had to re-create it.</p>

<p>Luckily, the syntax for this operation is dead simple:</p>

<pre><code>tell application "Safari"
    set bounds of front window to {0, 50, 1280, 770}
end tell
</code></pre>

<p>You can adjust the <code>{X, Y, width, height}</code> parameters accordingly—note that the width and height seem to be additive to the X/Y. So I use 770 instead of 720 for the height (720 + 50).</p>

<p>In <code>Script Editor</code>, save the file as a <code>.app</code>, with the option to keep it running unchecked. Now, whenever you want a window sized perfectly for capture, just press Command + Spacebar, then type in the name of the Script/App you saved, and hit enter. The top-most window in Safari will scale to exactly 720p resolution.</p></div>

## Morning ChatGPT Notes

date: 2024-01-28, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2017/09/04/peterRojas.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I spent a couple of days putting together a JSON text editor in a modal dialog for a project I'm working on. I'm combining the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/aceEditorDemo">Ace editor</a> with the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap toolkit</a>. I've used both components before, but never together. And they're always a bit tricky to get working because I'm impatient and the docs are spread out, and there are different versions. It's all kind of a mess, so you just get it working and move on, never quite sure why it works, and I rarely end up with reusable code. But it's certainly a lot better than starting from scratch, which basically is impossible, given the depth of the two components. After spinning my wheels a bit, I did what I always do in 2024, I turned to ChatGPT, outlined the problem, and asked if it knew of any sample code, which it proceeded to write for me, in about two seconds (not kidding about that). I copied their code and pasted it into my editor and ran it. It worked. Then I went through a number of iterations, restructuring the code to meet my needs, each time checking with ChatGPT, asking what it thought of my code. And of course there were problems, for example at one point there were two vertical scrollbars, and each time we worked <i>together</i> to figure out the problem and the fix. In the end, I have a solid editor that works exactly as I want it to, and best of all, I understand how it works. Here's the <a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/840e8159-9988-4159-8289-5167d6fb78c8">transcript of the work</a> I did with it, over more than 24 hours, a few different sessions. </p>
<p>I'll try to remember when this code ships as part of a product, to link to this perspective.</p>
<p>Next up, I'd like to get it to understand my coding conventions, so when it shares code with me it can save me the step of having to convert its conventions to mine. In other words, I'd like to return the favor. It's doing a great job of teaching and coaching me. I'd like to teach it how to do that better, so we work better together over time. And perhaps it can teach human programmers what I've learned about programming in over 50 years of doing this work. </p>
<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2017/09/05/enjoyEveryDay.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">A bit of philosophy. People say these things aren't intelligent, but seriously, if I can engage with it as if it were intelligent, far more intelligent in ways than I am, what's the difference between that and actually being intelligent? I know from a lifetime of dealing with supposedly intelligent humans, and being one myself, how rarely we focus on the idea that the person we're conversing with has an inner life that's vastly different from ours and no less complex, and contradictory. We tend to think of others as being like us, or like someone who raised us. Always in a movie, never in the moment. So why is it interesting that ChatGPT is a machine? These are questions thinkers and writers have been pondering for decades if not centuries, but -- <i>now we're living it.</i> I'm so happy to have made it this far! An amazing experience, so much learning in so little time. I don't understand how people can sit on the sidelines and not want to be the first to try all this stuff out, to be part of its evolution. I feel so lucky. </p>
<p>A puzzling thing, in the transcripts I'm identified as "anonymous," but I am logged in. It must know my name. I bet this is some kind of setting which defaults to anonymous, to play it safe. </p>
<p>One more thing. I copied and pasted the text above into ChatGPT. <a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/5fe361cd-1fca-4e8d-82cc-920514e8c4b8">Here are its comments</a>. A funny thing about ChatGPT is that you can't ask it how to use ChatGPT itself. It doesn't know about the chat UI? </p>
<p>Yet another thing. I remember my father, when he was forced to retire by illness, said how fortunate he was that the internet was there, so he could be involved in the world even though he had stopped working. He said his father would have loved it, and I don't doubt that he would. Same with ChatGPT. My parents and uncles were always looking up stuff, wanting to understand how things worked. This is a whole new level. The machines are now far better at collaborating over the net than humans are. Where will that take us? Maybe this is something else we can learn from the machines. </p>

## Drivethru, I am unhappy!

date: 2024-01-28, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1>Drivethru, I am unhappy!</h1>

<p>The DrivethruRPG website so depends on shit that it loads from other domains that I cannot log in no matter how many exceptions I add to uBlock Origin, Privacy Badger, or the Firefox content blocking preferences. And with every second I spend doing this, I resent them more. And when I finally start Chromium to try and connect, I&rsquo;m already ranting as I sit at my laptop. And then I get Connection timed out from cloudflare and really… I feel like they don&rsquo;t want my money. Uuuugh.</p>

<p>I used their contact form. When I hit the submit button I was greeted by a white page. I don&rsquo;t know if they go an email. (I did try the next day from a phone and that worked – which sort of illustrates the point.)</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what I wrote:</p>

<p>I think in a world where big tech is tracking us, where everybody and their uncle is spying on us, it is only natural that people start locking down their browser. I have uBlock Origin and Privacy Badger installed and I tell all my browsers to do as much content blocking as they can, I delete all cookies when I close the browser. It&rsquo;s the right thing to do. It is all the more galling when a website such as Drivethru becomes practically unusable as a consequence of me trying to do the right thing. It feels as if Drivethru is betraying me to the big tech corporations, helping them spy on me. It&rsquo;s a revolting feeling. These days, I have it every time I remember to use an unprotected Chromium browser just to log into Drivethru. Every single time I wish for an alternative. Every single time I hope that itch.io and other competitors end up replacing you.</p>

<p>If only you had a simple, straight forward website, served your own Javascript, had no tracking, and allowed me to browse stuff and buy it.
I don&rsquo;t really expect an answer to this email. It just feels unfair to rant on social media about the situation without telling you about it.</p>

<p>I hope Drivethru improves. I really do. I believe that change is possible and I hope that you do, too.</p>

## Tiny11 creates a 100MB version of Windows 11 by axing the windows

date: 2024-01-28, from: OS News

If you know your Windows history, you&#8217;ll know that the operating system got that name when it moved away from using pure MS-DOS and started using a graphical user interface to show things. As it turns out, you can force Windows 11 back to its legacy roots and reduce it back to a command-line interface. This is what the developer of Tiny11 has achieved, calling their new creation &#8220;Minwin.&#8221; The developer of Win11, NTDev, posted a video on YouTube about their project. There&#8217;s absolutely nothing flashy here; no Copilot, no Start menu, and definitely no UI. It&#8217;s as graphically complex as the Command Prompt, which meant that NTDev had to resort to fancy 00s-era ASCII logos to announce that Minwin was working. ↫ Simon Batt at XDA Definitely a neat proof-of-concept, and it shows just how modular Windows could be if only Microsoft allowed its users to take out the parts they don&#8217;t need. I wonder how close this is to Nano Server, an installation option for Windows Server you&#8217;ve probably never heard of. I also like the nod to MinWin, the informal codename Microsoft used internally to refer to an effort by a small number of expert Windows kernel engineers to untangle the spaghetti ball of dependencies that had sprouted between the various architectural layers of Windows. This project started around Vista, and eventually made it possible to make broader, sweeping changes to Windows without breaking things all over the place because the spaghetti ball of internal, low-level dependencies wasn&#8217;t mapped out.

## Two months in Servo: better inline layout, stable Rust, and more

date: 2024-01-28, from: OS News

Another month, another pile of improvement to Servo, the rendering engine written in Rust, originally a Mozilla project. This month the proof-of-concept browser UI got forward and backward buttons, making this bare-bones UI just a tiny bit more usable. Of course, the vast majority of changes and improvements are all focused on the actual rendering engine, which makes sense because Servo definitely isn&#8217;t ready for any prime time use &#8211; nor is anyone claiming it is. I&#8217;m incredibly curious to see where Servo goes in the future.

## Barman 3.10.0 Released

date: 2024-01-28, from: PostgreSQL News

<p><a href="https://www.enterprisedb.com">EDB</a> is pleased to announce the release of Barman 3.10.0. </p>
<h2>Highlights of this release:</h2>
<h3>Features:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Limit the average bandwidth used by <code>barman-cloud-backup</code> when backing
 up to either AWS S3 or Azure Blob Storage according to the value set by
 a new CLI option <code>--max-bandwidth</code>.</li>
<li>Add the new configuration option <code>lock_directory_cleanup</code>
 That enables cron to automatically clean up the barman_lock_directory
 from unused lock files.</li>
<li>Add support for a new type of configuration called <code>model</code>.
 The model acts as a set of overrides for configuration options
 for a given Barman server.</li>
<li>Add a new barman command <code>barman config-update</code> that allows the creation
 and the update of configurations using JSON</li>
<li>Related to this Barman release, <a href="https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/barman/blob/master/NEWS">pg_backup_api</a> has been updated and released to support these new features.  As a result, Barman now supports changes in the configuration whilst it's running. This pg-backup-api release adds the required endpoints to trigger that switch when requested.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug fixes:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fix a bug that caused <code>--min-chunk-size</code> to be ignored when using <code>barman-cloud-backup</code> as a hook script in Barman.</li>
</ul>
<p>This information is also published in the <a href="https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/barman/blob/master/NEWS">NEWS</a> for Barman.</p>
<h3>About Barman</h3>
<p>Backup and Recovery Manager (or Barman) is an open-source administration tool for remote backups and disaster recovery of PostgreSQL servers in business-critical environments. It relies on PostgreSQL’s robust and reliable Point-In-Time Recovery technology, allowing DBAs to remotely manage a complete catalog of backups and the recovery phase of multiple remote servers – all from one location. Barman is distributed under GNU GPL 3 and maintained by <a href="https://www.enterprisedb.com">EDB</a>.</p>
