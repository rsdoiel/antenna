## NASA’s Hubble Traces Dark Matter in Dwarf Galaxy Using Stellar Motions

date: 2024-07-11, from: NASA breaking news

The qualities and behavior of dark matter, the invisible “glue” of the universe, continue to be shrouded in mystery. Though galaxies are mostly made of dark matter, understanding how it is distributed within a galaxy offers clues to what this substance is, and how it’s relevant to a galaxy’s evolution. While computer simulations suggest dark […]

It was quite a throwback, lots of questions about what I was talking about, I've forgotten a lot of it. It took a full hour to prepare the feed. I can tell this is going to be quite a flashback experience. Maybe it'll get me in the mode to do some serious innovating, because we were on fire and didn't know it, in so many ways, back in the summer of 2004.

## If AI chatbots are the future, I hate it

<p>About a week ago, my home Internet (AT&amp;T Fiber) went from the ~1 Gbps I pay for down to about 100 Mbps (<a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2021/monitor-your-internet-raspberry-pi">see how I monitor my home Internet with a Pi</a>). It wasn't too inconvenient, and I considered waiting it out to see if the speed recovered at some point, because latency was fine.</p>

<p>But as you can see around 7/7 on that graph, the 100 Mbps went down to about <em>eight</em>, and that's the point where my wife starts noticing how slow the Internet is. Action level.</p>

<p>So I fired up AT&amp;T's support chat. I'm a programmer, I can usually find ways around the wily ways of chatbots.</p>

<p>Except AT&amp;T's AI-powered chatbot seems to have a fiendish tendency to equate 'WiFi' with 'Internet', no doubt due to so many people thinking they are one and the same.</p></div>

I agree with <a href="https://www.manton.org/2024/07/10/looking-at-my.html">Manton</a>. The way the twitter-alikes do discourse is not the only possible way, and imho, and, as I've said <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2007/12/17/howSpamWillLikelyEnterTheT.html">before</a> (in 2007!), most of what passes for discourse on twitter is actually spam, and that goes for Masto, Threads, Bluesky and Facebook (aka FriendFeed).

## 2024-07-09 Murten

date: 2024-07-10, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-07-09-murten">2024-07-09 Murten</h1>

<p>We&rsquo;re spending two nights in Murten or Morat. The lake is small with a circumference of about 25km. <a href="2018-murten/index">A few years ago</a> we ran around it – but today we ran about six or seven kilometres before turning back. 13km is enough, these days. We&rsquo;re both out of shape, sadly.</p>

<p>Just after sunset, looking out over the lake.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-09-murten-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Working on a half-enclosed patio until late into the night. There was drunken shouting to be heard until midnight, on a Monday. I did not know that this sleepy town was so rowdy!</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-09-murten-2.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The town itself looks unchanged from our last visit in 2018.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-09-murten-3.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We ran over to the eastern side of the lake, a protected wetland.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-09-murten-4.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Our destination was this village at the foot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mont_Vully">Mont Vully</a>.
A rather small mountain.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-09-murten-5.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>It got rather hot so by the time we arrived in Sugiez, I was so very tired. My wife took this picture.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-09-murten-6.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Canals connect the lake of Murten, the lake of Neuchâtel and the lake of Bienne. So many motorboats with proud men and underdressed women going up and down the channel. 🙄</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-09-murten-7.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The first sunflowers are out! My wife took this picture.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-09-murten-8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Switzerland">#Switzerland</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Pictures">#Pictures</a></p>

<p><strong>2024-07-10</strong> I was interested in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Morat">Battle of Morat</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On 22 June 1476, Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, laid siege to the place in an action known as the Battle of Morat. The town hung on for 13 days but finally was saved by the Bernese army. The enemy&rsquo;s army was destroyed completely — some 10,000 Burgundians were killed. Since then, Murten celebrates the victory every year on June 22. – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murten">Murten</a>, Wikipedia</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was impressed with a black and white image of the battle on the Wikipedia page but felt it didn&rsquo;t have enough resolution. I started looking for a better scan. e-rara, &ldquo;the platform for digitized rare books from Swiss institutions&rdquo; has <a href="https://doi.org/10.3931/e-rara-5076">the book</a>!</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-09-murten-10.png" alt="A black and white depiction of the battle" /></p>

<p>Die Schlacht bei Murten, Seite 265, aus Stumpf, Johannes: Gemeiner

<p>In the common room of our place in Murten, I found a very nice reproduction of an image from the Lucerne Chronicle and took a photo using my phone.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-09-murten-9.jpg" alt="A colourful depiction of the battle" /></p>

<p>Diebold Schilling der Jüngere: Luzerner Chronik. Doppelseitige Blätter 107b/108a, um 1511–1513</p>

<p>All these cruelties of war. The guy that climbed a tree and gets stabbed. The decapitated corpses, some of them stripped naked. The people hanging from the tree. The soldiers drowning. Ooof!</p>

<p>Apparently the <a href="https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/de/list/one/kol/S0023-2">Lucerne Chronicles</a> can be found in e-codices, Virtual Manuscript Library of Switzerland.
&ldquo;The goal of e-codices is to provide free access to all medieval and a selection of modern manuscripts of Switzerland by means of a virtual library.&rdquo;
The book is in the public domain and yet the site says <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/">CC BY NC 4.0</a>.</p>

<p>When I looked at page 107, I didn&rsquo;t see the image above, however. Some more investigation is required.</p>

<p>Actually, I did find it! Pages 218–219 are the ones I was looking for. I downloaded the &ldquo;large&rdquo; pages, stitched them together in Gimp, saved them using 80% quality (😥) and uploaded them.</p>

## AmigaKit launches a new Amiga that’s not an Amiga at all

date: 2024-07-10, from: OS News

I try to keep tabs on a huge number of operating system projects out there &#8211; for obvious reasons &#8211; but long ago I learned that when it comes to the world of Amiga, it&#8217;s best to maintain distance and let any important news find its way out of the Amiga bubble, lest one loses their sanity. Keeping up with the Amiga world requires following every nook and cranny of various forums and websites with different allegiances to different (shell) companies, with often barely coherent screeching and arguments literally nobody cares about. It&#8217;s a mess is what I&#8217;m trying to say. Anyway, it seems one of the many small companies still somehow making a living in the Amiga world, AmigaKit, has recently released a new device, the A600GS. It&#8217;s a retrogaming-oriented Amiga computer, but it does come with something called AmiBench, that&#8217;s apparently a weird hybrid between bits of Amiga OS 4 and AROS, so it does also support running a proper desktop and associated applications, but only AmigaOS 3.x applications (I think? It&#8217;s a bit unclear). It has HDMI at up to 1080p, and even WiFi and Bluetooth support, which is pretty neat. Wait, Wifi and Bluetooth support? What are we really dealing with here? Once again the information is hard to find because AmigaKit is incredibly stingy with specifications &#8211; I had to read goddamn YouTube comments to get some hints &#8211; but it seems to be a custom board with an Orange Pi Zero 3 stuck on top doing most of the work. In other words, the meat of this thing is just an emulator, which in and of itself isn&#8217;t a bad thing, it&#8217;s just weird to me that they&#8217;re not upfront and direct about this. While this answers some questions, it also raises a whole bunch more. If this is running on low-end Allwinner ARM hardware from 2022, how is this AmiBench desktop environment (or operating system?) a &#8220;fork of OS4 with AROS code in it&#8220;? AmigaOS 4 is PowerPC-only, which may explain why AmigaKit only mentions AmigaOS 3.x and 68K compatibility, and not AmigaOS 4 compatibility. And what&#8217;s AROS doing in there? I mean, this is an interesting product in the sense that it&#8217;s a relatively cheap turnkey solution for classic Amiga enthusiasts, but a new Amiga this is definitely not. At about €130, this is not a bad deal, but other than hardcore fans of the classic 68K Amiga, I don&#8217;t see many people being interested in this. The Apollo Standalone V4+ piques my interest way more, but at €700-800, it&#8217;s also a lot more expensive, but at least they&#8217;re much clearer about what the Apollo is, what software it&#8217;s running, and that they&#8217;re giving back their work to AROS.

<p>She stepped down as Democratic leader in the House to let a new generation lead, yet maintained here position as sort of overseeing and giving her blessings to how they go forward.</p>
<p>She also helped organize the Jan 6 committee, which in the end was the only real official judgement of Trump on the insurrection before the election. </p>
<p>I don't know how she and Biden get along.</p>
<p>It's much better to have her leading this discussion than the children who write the NYT these days. Playing with powerful tools/weapons they don't understand, at best, being manipulated by vicious fascists at worst.</p>
<p>I trust Pelosi in this situation, we're lucky to have her.</p>

## NASA’s Hubble Finds Strong Evidence for Intermediate-Mass Black Hole in Omega Centauri

Most known black holes are either extremely massive, like the supermassive black holes that lie at the cores of large galaxies, or relatively lightweight, with a mass of under 100 times that of the Sun. Intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) are scarce, however, and are considered rare “missing links” in black hole evolution. Now, an international […]

## “I fixed a 6-year-old .deb installation bug in Ubuntu MATE and Xubuntu”

date: 2024-07-10, from: OS News

I love a good bug hunting story, and this one is right up there as a great one. Way back in 2018, Doug Brown discovered that after installing Ubuntu MATE 18.04, if he launched Firefox from the icon in the default panel arrangement to install Chrome from the official Chrome website, the process was broken. After downloading the .deb and double-clicking it, GDebi would appear, but after clicking &#8220;Install&#8221;, nothing happened. What was supposed to happen is that after clicking &#8220;Install&#8221;, an authentication dialog should appear where you enter your root password, courtesy of gksu. However, this dialog did not appear, and without thinking too much of it, Brown shrugged and just installed the downloaded Chrome .deb through the terminal, which worked just fine. While he didn&#8217;t look any deeper into the cause of the issue, he did note that as the years and new Ubuntu releases progressed, the bug would still be there, all the way up until the most recent release. Finally, 2.5 years ago, he decided to dive into the bug. It turned out there were lots of reports about this issue, but nobody stepped up to fix it. While workarounds were made available through wrapper scripts, and deeper investigations into the cause revealed helpful information. The actual error message was a doozy: &#8220;Refusing to render service to dead parents&#8221;, which is quite metal and a little disturbing. In summary, the problem was that GDebi was using execv() to replace itself with an instance of pkexec, which was intended to bring up an authentication dialog and then allow GDebi to run as a superuser. pkexec didn’t like this arrangement, because it wants to have a parent process other than init. Alkis mentioned that you could recreate the problematic scenario in a terminal window by running gdebi-gtk with setsid to run it in a new session. ↫ Doug Brown Backing up a few steps, if the name &#8220;gksu&#8221; rings a bell for you, you might have already figured out where the problem most likely originated from. Right around that time, 2018, Ubuntu switched to using PolicyKit instead, and gksu was removed from Ubuntu. GDebi was patched to work with PolicyKit instead, and this was what introduced the actual bug. Sadly, despite having a clear idea of the origin of the bug, as well as where to look to actually fix it, nobody picked it up. It sat there for years, causing problems for users, without a fix in sight. Brown was motivated enough to fix it, submitted the patch, but after receiving word it would be looked at within a few days, he never heard anything back for years, not helped by the fact that GDebi has long been unmaintained. It wasn&#8217;t until very recently that he decided to go back again, and this time, after filling out additional information required for a patch for an unmaintained package, it was picked up, and will become available in the next Ubuntu release (and will most likely be backported, too). Brown further explains why it took so long for the bug to be definitely fixed. Not only is GDebi unmaintained, the bug also only manifested itself when launching Firefox from the panel icon &#8211; it did not manifest when launching Firefox from the MATE menu, so a lot of people never experienced it. On top of that, as we all sadly know, Ubuntu replaced the Firefox .deb package with the SNAP version, which also doesn&#8217;t trigger the bug. It&#8217;s a long story for sure, but a very interesting one. It shows how sometimes, the stars just align to make sure a bug does not get fixed, even if everyone involved knows how to fix it, and even if fixes have been submitted. Sometimes, things just compound to cause a bug to fall through the cracks.

## Resuming the Podcast0 feed

date: 2024-07-10, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>A new episode for the <a href="https://this.how/podcast0/">Podcast0 feed</a>.</p>
<p>After a break since June 20, we now resume my original "audio blog" from the summer of 2004, twenty years ago.</p>
<p>I was just beginning to figure out how this new medium worked, and rather than record my own thoughts, as with the previous two episodes, I published audio from another source, my meditation teacher, Jeru Kabbal. </p>
<p>Starting with the next episode, tomorrow, an interview with Steve Gillmor, one of the earliest podcast pioneers -- we'll have an original audio blog post. That's when the pulse really starts. </p>
<p>A <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/07/10/upcomingEpisodes.png">screen shot</a> of upcoming episodes from <a href="http://morningcoffeenotes.com/">morningcoffeenotes</a>.</p>

<p>I've been making mistakes in 2024 on almost every episode. This time I got the title wrong, it's Sunrise of the Soul. Rather than change it, and take a chance of the episode showing up twice in some podcast clients, I'm just leaving it as-is. Trying to get a feel for how most of the clients work. Do they refresh posts, if the descriptions change (as this one is)? I don't know. </p>
<p>Do the clients strip out the HTML or do they support some of it? I wonder if links make it through to most clients?</p>

<div style="float:left"><img title="Gryphon" alt="Gryphon" src="https://www.darpa.mil/DDM_Gallery/Gryphon_Logo_619x316_thumb.jpg" border="0"/></div>Radio frequency (RF) and microwave signals are integral carriers of information for technology that enriches our everyday life - cellular communication, automotive radar sensors, and GPS navigation, among others. At the heart of each system is a single-frequency RF or microwave source, the stability and spectral purity of which is critical. While these sources are designed to generate a signal at a precise frequency, in practice the exact frequency is blurred by phase noise, arising from component imperfections and environmental sensitivity, that compromises ultimate system-level performance.

<img src="https://www.jayeless.net/media/2024/07/naming-rules.png" alt="Restrictions on Baby Names: To protect children against careless and harmful names, the government had set out rules in registering baby names in Australia. The rules state that a child’s name must: not be obscene or offensive or contrary to public interest; (no racial slurs or infringements on the rights of another; be short and easy to write (In NSW, under 50 characters); not include symbols without phonetic significance such as N@talie, Da!sy, J#ke) or use numerals; not include or resemble an official title or military rank recognised in Australia such as King, Lady, Father, Prince, Sir or Admiral.Â  This was after a law was passed sometime in 1995 prohibiting the use of titles as part of the baby’s given name. use English letters only; not be similar to a recognised body, organisation or trademark; and In Queensland, the name can’t include a statement, like Save Mother Earth or Down with Capitalism.">

That’s the real problem. The press can point out a problem, and it is a problem, but no one has the ability to build a consensus among voters. I think it’s possible to put together an online version of the Democratic Party, something that never goes away, is available to rally the electorate at any moment. That’s the way to neutralize the power of the media moguls who have us wrapped around their fingers.

## PGroonga 3.2.1 - Multilingual fast full text search

date: 2024-07-10, from: PostgreSQL News

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>PGroonga 3.2.1 has been released!</p>
<p>This release adds support for WAL resource manager!</p>
<p>With the WAL resource manager support, you can solve the
following problems with the general WAL approach in PGroonga &lt; 3.2.1:</p>
<ul>
<li>You need to remove old WAL manually to avoid unlimited storage usage</li>
<li>You need to use additional mechanism to apply WAL in background</li>
<li>You need to recover from a crash after PostgreSQL started</li>
</ul>
<p>See also the following document how to use this feature:
<a href="https://pgroonga.github.io/reference/streaming-replication-wal-resource-manager.html">Streaming replication by WAL resource manager</a></p>
<p>Note that you need PostgreSQL 15 or later because this is based on
custom WAL resource manager feature that is available since PostgreSQL 15. </p>
<p>If you're interesting in how to implement the WAL resource manager,
see also the following blog post:</p>
<p>Japanese:
<a href="https://www.clear-code.com/blog/2024/7/5/pgroonga-custom-wal-resource-manager.html">How to implement the PGroonga's WAL resource manager</a></p>
<p>English:
<a href="https://www-clear--code-com.translate.goog/blog/2024/7/5/pgroonga-custom-wal-resource-manager.html?_x_tr_sl=ja&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=ja&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp">Google Translate of the post</a></p>
<h3>About PGroonga</h3>
<p><a href="https://pgroonga.github.io/">PGroonga</a> is a PostgreSQL extension that
makes PostgreSQL fast full text search platform for all languages!
It's released under PostgreSQL license.</p>
<p>There are some PostgreSQL extensions that improves full text search feature
of PostgreSQL such as pg_trgm<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/pgtrgm.html">^1</a>.</p>
<p>pg_trgm doesn't support languages that use non-alphanumerics characters such
as Japanese and Chinese.</p>
<p>PGroonga supports all languages, provides rich full text search related
features and is very fast. Because PGroonga uses Groonga<a href="https://groonga.org/">^2</a> that is a
full-fledged full text search engine as backend.</p>
<p>See the following benchmark results for performance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Benchmark result for PGroonga, textsearch and pg_trgm with English Wikipedia
    https://pgroonga.github.io/reference/pgroonga-versus-textsearch-and-pg-trgm.html</li>
<li>Benchmark result for PGroonga and pg_bigm with Japanese Wikipedia
    https://pgroonga.github.io/reference/pgroonga-versus-pg-bigm.html</li>
</ul>
<p>PGroonga also supports JSON search. You can use each value
for condition. You can also perform full text search against
all texts in JSON like textsearch in PostgreSQL.</p>
<h3>Changes</h3>
<p>Here are highlights in PGroonga 3.2.1:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added support for WAL resource manager</li>
<li>Added support for downgrading by using <code>ALTER EXTENSION ... UPDATE</code></li>
<li>Added support for Ubuntu 24.04 (Noble Numbat)</li>
<li>Added support for typo-tolerance search</li>
<li>Fixed some crash bugs</li>
</ul>
<p>See also <a href="https://pgroonga.github.io/news/#version-3-2-1">the 3.2.1 release note</a>
for full changes.</p>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>You can use PGroonga without full text search knowledge. You
just create an index and puts a condition into WHERE:</p>
<pre><code>CREATE INDEX index_name ON table USING pgroonga (column);
SELECT * FROM table WHERE column &amp;@~ 'PostgreSQL';
</code></pre>
<p>You can also use LIKE to use PGroonga. PGroonga provides a
feature that performs LIKE with index. LIKE with PGroonga
index is faster than LIKE without index. It means that you
can improve performance without changing your application
that uses the following SQL:</p>
<pre><code>SELECT * FROM table WHERE column LIKE '%PostgreSQL%';
</code></pre>
<p>Are you interested in PGroonga? Please install<a href="https://pgroonga.github.io/install/">^4</a> and try
tutorial<a href="https://pgroonga.github.io/tutorial/">^5</a>. You can know all PGroonga features.</p>
<p>You can install PGroonga easily. Because PGroonga provides
packages for major platforms. There are binaries for
Windows.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

## Google extends Linux kernel support to keep Android devices secure for longer

date: 2024-07-09, from: OS News

Android, like many other operating systems, uses the open-source Linux kernel. There are several different types of Linux kernel releases, but the type that’s most important to Android is the long-term support (LTS) one, as they’re updated regularly with important bug fixes and security patches. Starting in 2017, the support lifetime of LTS releases of Linux was extended from two years to six years, but early last year, this extension was reversed. Fortunately, Google has announced that moving forward, they’ll support their own LTS kernel releases for four years. Here’s why that’s important for the security of Android devices. ↫ Mishaal Rahman at Android Authority I fully support the Linux kernel maintainers dropping the LTS window from six to two years. The only places where such old kernels were being used were embedded devices and things like smartphones vendors refused to update to newer Android releases, and it makes no sense for kernel maintainers to be worrying about that sort of stuff. If an OEM wants to keep using such outdated kernels, the burden should be on that OEM to support that kernel, or to update affected devices to a newer, supported kernel. It seems Google, probably wisely, realised that most OEMs weren&#8217;t going to properly upgrade their devices and the kernels that run on them, and as such, the search giant decided to simply create their own LTS releases instead, which will be supported for four years. Google already maintains various Android-specific Linux kernel branches anyway, so it fits right into their existing development model for the Android Linux kernel. Some of the more popular OEMs, like Google itself or Samsung, have promised longer support life cycles for new Android versions on their devices, so even with this new Android-specific LTS policy, there&#8217;s still going to be cases where an OEM will have to perform a kernel upgrade where they didn&#8217;t have to before with the six year LTS policy. I wonder if this is going to impact any support promises made in recent years.

## Mozilla opts to extended Windows 7/8/8.1 support

date: 2024-07-09, from: OS News

Among them, Byron Jourdan, Senior Director, Product Management of Mozilla, under the Reddit username ComprehensiveDoor643 revealed that Mozilla plans to support Firefox on Windows 7 for longer. When asked separately about whether it also included Windows 8 and 8.1 too, Jourdan added that it was certainly the plan, though for how long the extended support would last was still undecided. ↫ Sayan Sen at Neowin Excellent move by Mozilla. I doubt there&#8217;s that many new features and frameworks in Windows 10 or 11 that are absolutely essential to Firefox working properly, so assuming it can gracefully disable any possible Windows 10/11-exclusive features, it should be entirely possible to use Firefox as an up-to-date, secure, and capable browser on Windows 7/8.x. Windows 7 and 8.x users still make up about 2.7% of Windows users worldwide, and with Windows&#8217; popularity, that probably still translates to millions and millions of people. Making sure these people have access to a safe and secure browser is a huge boon, and I&#8217;m very happy Mozilla is going to keep supporting these platforms as best they can, at least for now. For those of us who already consider especially Windows 7 a retrocomputing platform &#8211; I sure do &#8211; this is also great news, as any retro box or VM we load up with it will also get a modern browser. Just excellent news all around.

## No more boot loader: please use the kernel instead

date: 2024-07-09, from: OS News

Most people are familiar with GRUB, a powerful, flexible, fully-featured bootloader that is used on multiple architectures (x86_64, aarch64, ppc64le OpenFirmware). Although GRUB is quite versatile and capable, its features create complexity that is difficult to maintain, and that both duplicate and lag behind the Linux kernel while also creating numerous security holes. On the other hand, the Linux kernel, which has a large developer base, benefits from fast feature development, quick responses to vulnerabilities and greater overall scrutiny. We (Red Hat boot loader engineering) will present our solution to this problem, which is to use the Linux kernel as its own bootloader. Loaded by the EFI stub on UEFI, and packed into a unified kernel image (UKI), the kernel, initramfs, and kernel command line, contain everything they need to reach the final boot target. All necessary drivers, filesystem support, and networking are already built in and code duplication is avoided. ↫ Marta Lewandowska I&#8217;m not a fan of GRUB. It&#8217;s too much of a single point of failure, and since I&#8217;m not going to be dual-booting anything anyway I&#8217;d much rather use something that isn&#8217;t as complex as GRUB. Systemd-boot is an option, but switching over from GRUB to systemd-boot, while possible on my distribution of choice, Fedora, is not officially supported and there&#8217;s no guarantee it will keep working from one release to the next. The proposed solution here seems like another option, and it may even be a better option &#8211; I&#8217;ll leave that to the experts to discuss. It seems like to me that the ideal we should be striving for is to have booting the operating system become the sole responsibility of the EUFI firmware, which usually already contains the ability to load any operating system that supports UEFI without explicitly installing a bootloader. It&#8217;d be great if you could set your UEFI firmware to just always load its boot menu, instead of hiding it behind a function key or whatever. We made UEFI more capable to address the various problems and limitations inherent in BIOS. Why are we still forcing UEFI to pretend it still has the same limitations?

## Jon Stewart, yes you should STFU

It's always funny, great comedy, whether or not you agree with what he says, and I usually do agree. But not when it comes to him pushing President Biden out, without any idea of what comes next, and how the people, even some people who love his show, feel about having no voice. </p>
<p>If the voters organize, using the tools we have now, and stay organized after the election, we could elect anyone to be president. There's never been a more clear opportunity to win a landslide. It depends on organization, and elites not grabbing the steering wheel with no clue about what comes next, and driving us off a cliff. </p>
<p>I've been close to elites at times, and I can tell you, they aren't any smarter than you, they just have more power. I think that's been the real problem. We have failed to stay a democracy as we've gotten the tools to really be a democracy in ways we never could have before. And now we're at the last moment before it's all flushed away and the NYT et al (including our hero Stewart) are making it more certain, not less. </p>

## 2024-07-08 Neuchâtel

date: 2024-07-09, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-07-08-neuchâtel">2024-07-08 Neuchâtel</h1>

<p>We spent two nights in Neuenburg or Neuchâtel. They came under Prussian control in 1707 because the locals were looking for a government that was far away and wouldn&rsquo;t meddle in their affairs. It became a republic and a canton of Switzerland in 1848.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On the death in 1707 of Marie d&rsquo;Orleans-Longueville, duchess de Nemours and Princess of Neuchâtel, the people had to choose her successor from among fifteen claimants. They wanted their new prince first and foremost to be a Protestant, and also to be strong enough to protect their territory but based far enough away to leave them to their own devices. Louis XIV actively promoted the many French pretenders to the title, but the Neuchâtelois people passed them over in favour of King Frederick I of Prussia, who claimed his entitlement in a rather complicated fashion through the Houses of Orange and Nassau. With the requisite stability assured, Neuchâtel entered its golden age, with commerce and industry (including watchmaking and lace) and banking undergoing steady expansion. – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuch%C3%A2tel">Wikipedia</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We met a friend and went for a walk in the late afternoon: from La Neuveville up the Combe du Pulouvi. I took some flower pictures.</p>

date: 2024-07-09, from: O'Reilly Radar

It’s clear that generative AI is already being used by a majority—a large majority—of programmers. That’s good. Even if the productivity gains are smaller than many think, 15% to 20% is significant. Making it easier to learn programming and begin a productive career is nothing to complain about either. We were all impressed when Simon [&#8230;]

## Raspberry Pi OS airs out some fresh options for the summer

date: 2024-07-09, updated: 2024-07-09, from: Liam Proven's articles at the Register

<h4>Why go outside in the sunshine when you could play with tiny computers in a darkened room?</h4>
      <p>Perhaps hoping to mark independence from x86 PCs, there's a new July 4th release of the official Raspberry Pi OS, although it remains coy of giving a version number.</p>

## Some more thoughts on TBC

date: 2024-07-09, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>I know, I know. You’re tired of hearing me ranting about The Browser Company and their Arc “browser”. I’m also tired of reading about them but I keep stumbling on news about this silly company and I can’t help myself from yelling at the screen. They aired a commercial on TV the other day, clearly a reasonable thing to do when you have a product with no revenues and no business model. And not happy with that, they released a YouTube video with the CEO explaining the ideas “hidden” in the commercial and that tells you how good at marketing these people are. If you need to release an almost 5-minute video to explain the meaning of a stupid 1-minute ad you probably need a better marketing department.</p>
<p>Anyway, leaving aside the pointlessness of this whole thing what prompted me to write this post were some of the things the CEO said in the video explainer which are so profoundly stupid that I find them offensive. If you are an ARC user you should be offended too because he must think you’re all a bunch of idiots.</p>
<p>He said in the video that there were three questions he wanted to ask:</p>
<ol>
<li>What is this internet we want to live within?</li>
<li>What if the web were truly made for you?</li>
<li>What are we here for?</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>What is this internet we want to live within? What do we want to create for ourselves?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just to make it clear, what this company is allegedly making is a browser. It’s in their fucking name: The Browser Company. They’re not making a new internet. They’re not creating anything. As I wrote before, they’re not even making an actual browser like the awesome people at <a href="https://ladybird.org">Ladybird</a>. They’re building a wrapper around Chrome. This makes the CEO rant about browser monoculture even more hilarious since by doing that they're part of the problem.</p>
<p>In the video, he tries to argue that Silicon Valley companies are driven by efficiency, you type something in Google and he gives you an answer but there are times when you don’t want an answer, you want to get access to the best set of results because you’re after experiences and serendipity and a bunch of other complete nonsense. He asked, “Do we even believe in a single answer?“. The answer is no Josh. No, we don’t. This is why all search engines have a SERP. No search engine gives you one answer. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>A lot of other times something just seems really interesting to you and you want to go wide and deep and be surprised there are a lot of other things we might want to optimise for when we’re designing this new internet</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Designing this new internet? You’re not designing a new internet. You’re using some algorithm to decide for me which 6 or 8 results I should be seeing. In doing that you’re worse than Google. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The second thing is what would it look like if truly the web was made for you?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m gonna ask you a question Josh: how can you make a web for me without profiling me? I’ll wait for an answer the same way I’m still waiting to hear back from your support team on that ticket I opened months ago where I was asking how to prevent your stupid ARC Search from accessing my sites.</p>
<p>You asked “What does the personal web, the personal internet look like” and there are various ways to tackle this question but it certainly doesn’t look like a generated ARC Search result page that is the same for everyone. You said the web doesn’t feel personal because we all see the same stuff and yet you showed a screenshot of your stupid ARC Search pulling in results from Reddit and Trip Advisor. Again, if you’re reading this and you’re an ARC user, they must think you’re a complete idiot to believe all this stuff.</p>
<p>As for the final question, what are we here for and why am I looking at this video, well Josh, I work in tech. I code websites, I care about the web. Especially the independent, personal one. The one you’re ranting about but probably don’t care about at all. I also have to care about your stupid browser because even though it’s Chrome sometimes it has bugs that aren’t present on Chrome and so I have to test on it. I’d love to not care about your browser and your stupid ARC Search but I have to because this is the world I live in. My email is public if you want to get in touch. You probably won’t because why would you, you have nothing to gain from a private exchange after all.</p>                <hr>
                <p>Thank you for keeping RSS alive. You're awesome.</p>

<p>Guys, we have one of those Brother printers that are supposed to be so solid and reliable, but it is not cooperating today. Keeps sending itself to sleep mid-job and &ldquo;going offline&rdquo; so I have to physically walk to it and turn it back on. &ldquo;Printing&rdquo; blank pages. When told to print a three-page document (ONCE), it prints TWO copies of page 1 &amp; 2 then skips page 3. That &ldquo;just buy this Brother printer everyone has, it&rsquo;s fine&rdquo; article lied to me.</p>

## 2024-06-28 Connecting the laptop to the server via NNCP

date: 2024-07-08, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-06-28-connecting-the-laptop-to-the-server-via-nncp">2024-06-28 Connecting the laptop to the server via NNCP</h1>

<p>First, install the <code>nncp</code> package on both systems.
In addition to that, install the <code>openbsd-inetd</code> package on the server.
(In the following passages, I&rsquo;m connected as <code>root</code> to the server.)</p>

<p>Generate new configs on the systems that are missing <code>/etc/nncp.hjson</code>.</p>

<pre><code>nncp-cfgnew &gt; /etc/nncp.hjson
chown nncp:nncp /etc/nncp.hjson
chmod 660 /etc/nncp.hjson
</code></pre>

<p>Examine the file using a text editor.
Each system needs to know the public keys of the other.</p>

<p>So, on the laptop, I need to add to add the public keys of the server.
I also want to specify that I&rsquo;m going to call the node on a regular basis
and that files sent to me from that node should be saved in my &ldquo;incoming&rdquo;
directory. I also want to accept mail.</p>

<pre><code>    sibirocobombus: {
      id:       ...
      exchpub:  ...
      signpub:  ...
      noisepub: ...
      incoming: &quot;/home/alex/incoming/sibirocobombus&quot;
      exec: {
        sendmail: [&quot;/usr/sbin/sendmail&quot;]
      }
      addrs: {
        internet: &quot;alexschroeder.ch:5400&quot;
      }
      calls: [
        {
          cron: &quot;12 * * * *&quot;
        }
      ]
    }
</code></pre>

<p>And on the server, I need to add the public keys of the laptop.
I also want to save incoming files from the laptop.
And I want to accept mail.</p>

<pre><code>    melanobombus: {
      id:       ...
      exchpub:  ...
      signpub:  ...
      noisepub: ...
      incoming: &quot;/home/alex/incoming&quot;
      exec: {
        sendmail: [&quot;/usr/sbin/sendmail&quot;]
      }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Note how the laptop calls the server but the server does not call the laptop!</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s make sure those directories exist:</p>

<pre><code>mkdir ~/incoming
ssh sibirocobombus mkdir incoming
</code></pre>

<p>Let&rsquo;s create a file and send it from the laptop to the server using <code>nncp-file</code>:</p>

<pre><code>echo Hello &gt; hello.txt
sudo -u nncp nncp-file hello.txt sibirocobombus:
</code></pre>

<p>Check the log using <code>nncp-log</code>:</p>

<pre><code>nncp-log | tail -n 1
2024-06-28T21:36:02Z File hello.txt (282 B) is sent to sibirocobombus:hello.txt
</code></pre>

<p>Let&rsquo;s connect to the server and check:</p>

<pre><code>ssh sibirocobombus ls incoming
</code></pre>

<p>Nothing has arrived!</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s call the server using <code>nncp-call</code>:</p>

<pre><code>sudo -u nncp nncp-call sibirocobombus
2024-06-28T22:07:36Z ERROR Calling sibirocobombus (alexschroeder.ch:5400): dial tcp [2a02:418:6a04:178:209:50:237:1]:5400: connect: connection refused
</code></pre>

<p>Oops. It&rsquo;s not running? That&rsquo;s right, I need to run <code>nncp-daemon</code> on the server side.</p>

<p>Add the following to <code>/etc/inetd.conf</code> on the server to accept NNCP connections on port 5400:</p>

<pre><code>5400	stream	tcp	nowait	nncp	/usr/local/bin/nncp-daemon	nncp-daemon -quiet -ucspi
</code></pre>

<p>Reload it:</p>

<pre><code>systemctl reload openbsd-inetd
</code></pre>

<p>Try again on the laptop:</p>

<pre><code>sudo -u nncp nncp-call sibirocobombus
2024-06-28T22:14:13Z We have got for sibirocobombus: 1 packets, 486 B
2024-06-28T22:14:13Z ERROR SP with sibirocobombus (nice MAX): reading: EOF
2024-06-28T22:14:13Z ERROR Connection to sibirocobombus (alexschroeder.ch:5400): EOF
</code></pre>

<p>Back to the server:</p>

<pre><code>nncp-log
2024-06-28T22:15:25Z ERROR SP nice MAX: waiting for first message: unknown peer: ...
2024-06-28T22:15:25Z Connected to unknown
</code></pre>

<p>Strange! That id listed there matches my laptop&rsquo;s <code>noisepub</code>.
Checking the <code>/etc/nncp.hjson</code> on the server again, I see that pasted the wrong pubkeys… 🤦
Fix that and try again…</p>

<pre><code>sudo -u nncp nncp-call sibirocobombus
2024-06-28T22:19:31Z We have got for sibirocobombus: 1 packets, 486 B

</code></pre>

<p>Looking good!
Check for the file on the server:</p>

<pre><code>ssh sibirocobombus ls incoming
</code></pre>

<p>It&rsquo;s not there!</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s investigate on the server:</p>

<pre><code>nncp-log
2024-06-28T22:19:31Z Packet QAROTFMX25ZPQOT5DEQQC7JE7EN3UD2FZIJNI6JKH75EC2DMSSZQ (486 B) (nice B): 0%

</code></pre>

<p>This looks good, so we have the packet!
And we can confirm this using <code>nncp-stat</code>:</p>

<pre><code>nncp-stat

<p>What needs to happen now is &ldquo;tossing&rdquo; using <code>nncp-toss</code>.
This is, &ldquo;processing&rdquo; the packet and thereby delivering it.</p>

<pre><code>sudo -u nncp nncp-toss

</code></pre>

<p>That&rsquo;s right, the incoming file should be writable by more people…</p>

<pre><code>chgrp nncp /home/alex/incoming
chmod g+w /home/alex/incoming
</code></pre>

<p>Try again!</p>

<pre><code>sudo -u nncp nncp-toss

total 4
-rw-r--r-- 1 nncp nncp 6 29. Jun 00:26 hello.txt

cat /home/alex/incoming/hello.txt 
Hello
</code></pre>

<p>🥳</p>

<p>I need to think about <a href="https://nncp.mirrors.quux.org/Administration.html">admin issues</a>, clearly.</p>

<p>I need to set up regular <code>nncp-call</code> on the laptop; I need to set up regular <code>nncp-toss</code> on the server.</p>

<p>It would be nice to switch from <code>inetd</code> to <code>systemd</code> perhaps? Surely they have written a replacement for it. They have written replacements for everything! 😬</p>

Signal: Storing messages outside of your active Signal device is not supported. Messages are only stored locally. An iTunes or iCloud backup does not contain any of your Signal message history. This makes it private on iOS because other apps can&#8217;t access the message database. But the same design doesn&#8217;t work so well with the [&#8230;]

I got there when my grandmother died in 1977, when I was 22, my first close relative that I lost, and I tried to come to grips with the idea that I'd never see her again and found it impossible, but it was true nonetheless. No way to escape it. When my mother died, in 2018, I only thought after we cleared her house to be sold, the house I grew up in, that I didn't even take pictures of it before it was emptied. I was so used to it being a constant, I forgot to realize until it was too late, that I was saying goodbye to everything I knew for my entire life. Forever. It's why we're playing such a dangerous game of chicken with Biden's presidency, because the stakes are so incredibly high. A mathematical approach to this problem says imho that everyone should shut the fuck up about Biden's flaws and get us organized so we can handle any eventuality. The problem isn't that Biden might die, the problem is that even if he were to win, we'll be right back here in another four years, and at that time we will have to grapple with an even more dire situation. Whatever happens this year, what's waiting for us is for most of us to wake up from the dream that there are any constants in our lives. It's all falling apart, in every way. The only thing that matters is we start working together, intelligently, or else it's over.

<p>This is the time, every four years, when we have to confront the corruption of American journalism.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-07-08, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

I admit that after the debate and the interminable attacks from the press on our democratic process that I'm pretty depressed about the future. I was talking with a friend over the weekend, a fellow NYer who moved up to the mountains as I did, about the political situation, and I asked if he would be prepared to sign a loyalty oath to Trump. He said he'd never do it. If they tried to force him, he'd get a gun and shoot them. This isn't the first time I've heard that, and I called bullshit. You're never going to do that. I know this guy, I know myself. I won't do it either. And I think I probably will have to sign the loyalty oath and so will you. There are so many ways to turn your life off, legally -- and without recourse. Think about what happens when you lose access to a social media account. Or when a credit rating agency doesn't believe you are who you are. Or when someone hijacks your phone and you can't get back control of it (and try to use anything without a working phone number). I've been through all these miserable processes. And none of them were legal, or controlled by the US government. A president who demands loyalty of you will get it. And that is certainly exactly where we're headed, again.

## Design and build the next version of OSNews

date: 2024-07-08, from: OS News

Despite being live since 1997, OSNews has had fairly few redesigns in the grand scheme of things. If my memory serves me correctly, we&#8217;ve had a grand total of 6 designs, and we&#8217;re currently on version 6, introduced about 5 years ago because of unpleasant reasons. It&#8217;s now 2024, and for a variety of reasons, we&#8217;re looking to work towards version 7 of our almost 30 year old website, and we need help. I have a very clear idea of what I want OSNews 7 to be like &#8211; including mockups. The general goals are making the site visually simpler, reducing our dependency on WordPress extensions, and reducing the complexity of our theme and website elements to make it a bit easier for someone like me to change small things without breaking anything. Oh and a dark mode that works. Note that we&#8217;re not looking to change backends or anything like that &#8211; WordPress will stay. If you have the WordPress, design, and developer skills to make something like this a reality, and in the process shape the visual identity of one of the oldest continuously running technology news websites in the world, send me an email.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-07-08, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

I find the <a href="https://blogroll.social/">blogroll</a> on the <a href="http://scripting.com/">home page</a> of my blog to be an incredible <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/07/08/blogrollScreenShot.png">way</a> to catch up on what people I follow are posting to their blogs and news sites. It's more like a feed reader than a blogroll because when a site updates it moves to the top of the list and when you click the wedge next to the title you get the five most recent posts with links to the full story. Maybe it was a  mistake calling this a blogroll. I'm trying to come up with a better place to put it so more people would see it and use it and might think it would be nice to have a place like that for themselves. In any case I'm thinking about what to do next with FeedLand, which is what's behind the blogroll software. It hasn't lived up to my hopes, and I don't think it's likely to. I may be done writing software for others, I was writing only for myself for a few years, between 2017 and 2021, and I really liked that. The experiment of writing for others was not a success. So I'm thinking about how to wind down FeedLand, keep it available for the people who are already using it, but close it to new membership. Just thinking out loud here for a bit. It's that time, to consider what I want to do with the next few years, assuming, praise Murphy, I have them to play with. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>

## Getting the most out of TWM, X11’s default window manager

date: 2024-07-08, from: OS News

Graham&#8217;s TWM page has been around for like two decades or so and still isn&#8217;t even remotely as old as TWM itself, and in 2021 they published an updated version with even more information, tips, and tricks for TWM. The Tab Window Manager finds its origins in the lat 1980s, and has been the default window manager for the X Windowing System for a long time, now, too. Yet, few people know it exists &#8211; how many people even know X has a default window manager? &#8211; and even fewer people know you can actually style it, too. OK, so TWM is fairly easy to configure but alot of people, upon seeing the default config, scream &#8216;Ugh, thats awful!&#8217; and head off to the ports tree or their distro sources in search of the latest and greatest uber desktop environment. There are some hardcore TWM fans and mimimalists however who stick around and get to liking the basic feel of TWM. Then they start to mod it and create their own custom dekstop. All part of the fun in Unix :). ↫ Graham&#8217;s TWM page I&#8217;ll admit I have never used TWM properly, and didn&#8217;t know it could be themed at all. I feel very compelled to spend some time with it now, because I&#8217;ve always liked the by-now classic design where the right-click desktop menu serves as the central location for all your interactions with the system. There are quite a few more advanced, up-to-date forks of TWM as well, but the idea of sticking to the actual default X window manager has a certain charm. I almost am too afraid to ask, because the answer on OSNews to these sorts of questions is almost always &#8220;yes&#8221; &#8211; do we have any TWM users in the audience? I&#8217;m extremely curious to find out if TWM actually has a reason to exist at this point, or if, in 2024, it&#8217;s just junk code in the X.org source repository, because I&#8217;m looking at some of these screenshots and I feel a very strong urge to give it a serious go.

## A brief summary of click-to-raise and drag-and-drop interaction on X11 and Wayland

date: 2024-07-08, from: OS News

The goal is to be able to drag an icon from a background window without immediately raising that window and obscuring the drop target window when using the click-to-focus mode. This is a barebones description of what needs to happen. It assumes familiarity with code, protocols, etc. as needed. ↫ Quod Video The articles describes how to get there using both X and Wayland, and it&#8217;s clear there&#8217;s still quite a bit of work to do. At least on my KDE Wayland setups, the way it works now is that when I click to drag an icon from a lower Dolphin window to a higher one, it brings the lower window forward, but then, when I hover for a bit over the other window, it brings it back up. Of course, this only works if the destination window remains at least partially visible, which might not always be the case. For usability&#8217;s sake, there needs to be an option to start a drag operation from one window to the next without altering the Z-order.

## Dear journalism

date: 2024-07-07, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>You know how Trump said he could shoot someone on Fifth Ave and wouldn't lose any supporters. This is the same thing except with Biden.</p>
<p>What you need to know:</p>
<ol>
<li>We all knew this would happen.</li>
<li>We all saw it happen, we don't need you to tell us.</li>
<li>We're going with him anyway.</li>
</ol>
<p>The plan is this:</p>
<ol>
<li>If Biden gets disabled, or dies, before or after the election -- VP Harris steps up.</li>
<li>Now everyone can relax.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hot tip for journos: The Supreme Court <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/decloak">decloaked</a>, an even bigger story.</p>
<p>BTW, am I imagining it or has journalism inadvertently admitted that they all want Trump to lose? It's logical that they would, but I thought they always said they were objective on this stuff. The famous <a href="https://pressthink.org/2010/11/the-view-from-nowhere-questions-and-answers/">View From Nowhere</a>. Has that pretense accidentally been dropped?</p>

<p>I do regret my naïveté saying for years “one state or two state solutions”.   </p><p>The two state solution is merely gold-plating the turd of extermination.</p>

## Democratic superstars of 2024

date: 2024-07-07, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>On Mastodon, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@sarajw@front-end.social/112746718207413752">Sara Joy writes</a>: "Let Biden run. Let Kamala and lots of other younger Dems take on lots of events. Support him from underneath. If and when he falters, the party is there to prop him up, take up the slack, or step in."</p>
<p>I had a similar idea.</p>
<p>Make this the campaign of the cabinet, governors and congress.</p>
<p>Let all the great next generation democrats shine. </p>
<p>Big stadium events where a lot of them share the stage.</p>
<p>Joe Biden dials in via satellite.</p>
<p>"Listen, I'm an old dude, so I need my rest but look at all these bright young people who help me do the business of the American people. Aren't they wonderful!"</p>
<p>He puts on his robe and slippers, sits in a rocking chair with a dog at his feet and his grandchildren playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahtzee">yahtzee</a> and checkers...</p>
<p>And one of the juniors is hanging out with him, making sure he doesn't spill his beer, so you know they have his back.</p>
<p>Baseball cards are handed out at the events with each of the stars of the Democratic Party.</p>
<p>Collect them all!</p>
<p>You get 5 free cards with a $25 contribution.</p>
<p>Some would be very rare.</p>
<p>Also there would be Old Timers Day, where Bernie, Hillary, Barack, Michelle and Bill would have a concert. </p>
<p>Hosted by Mayor Pete!</p>
<p>Joe is at the top of the ticket, but we got him covered.</p>
<p>Out comes VP Kamala and she sings the anthem along with Taylor Swift wearing a red white and blue sequined outfit. </p>
<p>And Santa Claus, Uncle Sam, Betsy Ross, and the Founding Fathers. </p>
<p>Frederick Douglass, Martin Luther King, Jackie Robinson, Rosa Parks and the freedom fighters. </p>
<p>All the heroes of America, standing up for America. </p>
<p>The Greatest Generation and Repubs like Ike, even Reagan and of course Lynne Cheney.</p>
<p>We don't need no freaking monarch, they all sing.</p>
<p>No we don't! shouts the people. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJBaIUZwmTs&t=43s">On video</a>, the Dead sing "I'm Uncle Sam, how do you do!"</p>
<p>Shake the hand that shook the hand of PT Barnum and Charlie Chan.</p>
<p>We all march together to victory.</p>

<p>I should add that once you have this volume of photos, Apple Photos really shines - for searching events, people, locations, themes, memories;  and also to search text of screenshots and memes.</p>

<p>Two things I just learned:</p><p>- the iCloud storage is in addition to your AppleOne subscription, so I don’t need to buy the 6 TB tier yet, I only have to buy the additional 2TB to extent the 2TB I have from AppleOne.</p><p>- you can share the storage with your family (our family is 5, not sure if Apple Storage is Utah-friendly)</p>

<p>I wonder how your photo library compares to mine?   </p><p>I always loved photos, but taking pictures and videos of the kids took this to another level.</p>

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2020/11/26/uncleSam.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I'm glad Biden is attacking journalists, he has a much bigger voice than I do. If I had his influence I'd be saying the same things, though I wouldn't be as kind. It's time to put the journalists back where they belong, covering news, not trying to run the country.

It's time to stop caring what journalists think.

<p>We were looking after this little guy (the dog, Patches) for the weekend. He and Gidget got along so well! Very happy to sleep in close proximity and be chill. I think Gidget is happy to be the only pet again after Viv returned him home, though 😂</p>
