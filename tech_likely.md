## Intel unveils Lunar Lake architecture, moves RAM on-die

date: 2024-06-04, from: OS News

Hot on the heels of AMD, here&#8217;s Intel&#8217;s next-generation processor, this time for the laptop market. Overall, Lunar Lake represents their second generation of disaggregated SoC architecture for the mobile market, replacing the Meteor Lake architecture in the lower-end space. At this time, Intel has disclosed that it uses a 4P+4E (8 core) design, with hyper-threading/SMT disabled, so the total thread count supported by the processor is simply the number of CPU cores, e.g., 4P+4E/8T. ↫ Gavin Bonshor at AnandTech The most significant change in Lunar Lake, however, has nothing to do with IPC improvements, core counts, or power usage. No, the massive sea change here is that Lunar Lake will do away with separate memory sticks, instead opting for on-die memory at a maximum of 32GB LPDDR5X. This is very similar to how Apple packages its memory on the M dies, and yes, this also means that as far as thin Intel laptops go, you&#8217;ll no longer be able to upgrade your memory after purchase. You choose your desired amount of memory at purchase, and that&#8217;s what you&#8217;ll be stuck with. Buyer beware, I suppose. We can only hope Intel isn&#8217;t going to default to 8GB.

## A brief look at the 3DS cartridge protocol

date: 2024-06-04, from: OS News

About a week ago, there has been a little addition to the 3dbrew wiki page about 3DS cartridges (carts) that outlines the technical details of how the 3DS cartridge controller and a 3DS cartridge talk to each other. I would like to take this opportunity to also include the 3DS itself in the conversation to illuminate which part of which device performs which step. I will then proceed to outline where I think the corresponding design decisions originate. Finally, I will conclude with some concrete ideas for improvement. ↫ Forbidden Tempura Everything you ever wanted to know about 3DS cartridges and how they interact with the 3DS.

The test for whether it's a podcast or not is if they say you can get it "Wherever you get your podcasts." If they can say that, it's a podcast. If you have to get it from Apple or YouTube or whoever, it's not a podcast. That's the rule.

In other words the designers of CSS and JavaScript and probably every other technology everyone uses had no idea what actual developers were doing with their committee-designed creation. They made mistakes and piled them on each other, fixing old mistakes with new mistakes. After 30 years of evolving in this convoluted way, if you want to create useful software, you have to either master all of it (and no one has) or pay $20 a month to OpenAI so you can use it to navigate the awful hairball that the web platform has become. Where we only have a sliver of knowledge as humans, <i>the machine knows all of it.</i> And that's just programming. I'm just guessing that everything is that way. You know the <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/6c5a6426-62f9-48c1-9995-b4ae6f808907">part</a> in The Matrix Reloaded where we're told <a href="https://youtu.be/Ny_mr3QX9Q8?si=7GMMS7dBvZW5cOag&t=165">no one knows</a> how the technology works. That's where we are now. Spend your whole life using the stuff and you still only know a tiny fraction of what you need to make good software. We needed what ChatGPT does, but we didn't know we needed it. That's where we are now, and the journos are sitting on the sidelines hurling <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Make-Spitballs">spitballs</a> at it.

What got me spinning was listening to Rachel Maddow advertise her podcast at the beginning of her show last night. You can get the podcast for free, she says, or if you want no ads, you can pay some money and get it from Apple. What Apple is selling there, and Maddow is going along with, is not a freaking podcast and by calling it one they undermine a great medium. I understand why Maddow might not care, she makes millions from a medium that doesn't give users much choice (ie MSNBC) so why should she care about podcasting, which does.

If you have to use Apple, Audible, Spotify or Google to listen to something that's nice, hope it's good for you but folks that is not a podcast. Podcasts give you the listener all the power. If you give it up it'll all be Disneyfied before too long. It pisses me off that Amazon Music sends me messages about all the new "podcasts" they have. I mutter under my breath when I hear this, some expletive I'd rather not repeat here. Amazon, the users know that podcasting == user choice, and they hate you just a little every time you lie about it. Find another term you like and use that. You have the money to do the market testing. Come on, just once play fair. You'll be surprised how good it feels, and I wouldn't be surprised if the users reward you for it.

It guides me through difficult programming situations, esp around convoluted designs like CSS and JavaScript. It knows all of it. The only times it hallucinates (and I know it's doing it btw, I'm not stupid) is when there is not enough info on the web to give an answer. It would be nice if it just said "I don't know" but it's early, and they haven't figured out how to do that yet. The journalists have no sense of wonder I guess, or they never thought to use it in their jobs. I can't wait for the first aha! from a journalist -- who will say this: "Aha! Now I see what this is for and it's freaking lovely." But they've decided it sucks and that's that. Too bad, we're going on without them. And thanks to the good moderation tools we can keep the turd-droppers from totally screwing it up.

## Radar Trends to Watch: June 2024

May was a month of announcements: between Google, Apple, Microsoft, and OpenAI, there was much ado about—well, very little, in fact. It’s always seemed to me that big announcements steal attention that might otherwise go to projects that are less flashy but more deserving. (Or maybe I’m just becoming jaded.)

## 2024-05-23 Death and dying

date: 2024-06-04, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-05-23-death-and-dying">2024-05-23 Death and dying</h1>

<p>This is the first time somebody is dying in my close family where I am old enough to be an adult about it.</p>

<p>One of my sisters died when I was about twenty. I was living in Switzerland with my dad, and it was terrible to hear my mom crying at the phone, practically unable to tell me what had happened, to then see my father confused, shocked. I booked a flight for him but didn&rsquo;t go myself. My mom was living in Portugal with my two sisters. I wasn&rsquo;t there for my sister&rsquo;s burial. People had to be buried within 48 hours, back then. I don&rsquo;t know how things are now. There was school and stuff and I had not lived with my sisters for a few years. I didn&rsquo;t feel very close. It just felt weird. I didn&rsquo;t know what it was supposed to mean.</p>

<p>Now, thirty years later, my stepfather is dying. His kidneys are failing, his liver is failing, his lungs are filling up with water, his heart is failing; they can&rsquo;t give him his heart medication because the kidneys are at their limits, can&rsquo;t have him move around because he&rsquo;s weak, and so he&rsquo;s breaking down. I mean, he&rsquo;s calm, he knows what&rsquo;s happening, and he&rsquo;s very, very tired. He&rsquo;s ready to go.</p>

<p>I think that in my heart, I know that this is how it works. We have to go one day. I don&rsquo;t want to spend the last hours hooked up to machines. I&rsquo;ll be very, very tired. I&rsquo;ll just want to go home. I also won&rsquo;t want anybody around me to be sad. Hopefully, I&rsquo;ll feel that I lived a good life, that I had a good time, that the people I spend my time with were decent people, worthy of the short time I was given. I hope that I will be able to let go and be at peace. It&rsquo;s what I hear about my stepfather.</p>

<p>But when I sit in that family video call, with siblings in Portugal and Germany and my mother, and one after another people start crying, choking up, it&rsquo;s hard. It&rsquo;s that invisible choker, grabbing us, one after another.</p>

<p>I need to remember the good times, the conversations we had, the laughter we shared. I need to book a flight and see the rest of our family. All that independence and all that living abroad is coming back to haunt us, now.</p>

<p>To go and support each other.</p>

<p>Go and hug your loved ones.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Family">#Family</a></p>

<p><strong>2024-05-27</strong>. I arrived today. He didn’t look good at all. In fact, he seemed to be barely holding on to life. Sleeping, mostly. Occasionally, gasping for air, staring, maybe recognizing us, saying a word or two. It was heartbreaking. He died the same day. The doctor and the nurse came, two very friendly people. Removed the tubes, stopped the Morphium machine, made his death official.</p>

<p>There were so many tears. A step brother, a half-brother, a half-sister, my sister, my half-brother’s wife, their kid, my mom… the kid was the only one that seemed unperturbed. “Don’t be sad, grandma!”</p>

<p>Later the funerary services came to pick up the body. Again, both of them super nice. We’ll see how things go, tomorrow. My mother is not feeling well. I seem to be doing OK. I can be strong when it’s not my partner that has died.</p>

<p>I’m happy we were all there for him, singing songs, bringing him his birthday cake (he died on his 78th birthday). I’m happy we were all there for each other.</p>

<p><strong>2024-05-28</strong>. Cremation today. The sun is out. People on the radio.</p>

<p><strong>2024-05-30</strong>. On the way home. It was good to see the family again. I gave a little speech in Portuguese, explaining how the language continues to remain important to us, even if we live a abroad, and how hard it was for a family where people live in different countries, alone – but also how our parents divorcing and marrying had led to an ever growing family. There are more parents, more siblings, and I love it and it helps. We can all help each other. And my deceased stepfather was certainly an enrichment for our family, bringing anarchy and lawlessness and laughter into a family that was rigid and regimented and dour, and how we all grew with that and how it was important to remember the good times we had and the lessons we all drew from his presence. Truly, a great influence for all of us.</p>

<p>I still remember how I met him years before my mother met him. He lived across the river alone with his son, wild and free and I was so jealous. I wished to live like that! And then my parents divorced, my dad went back to Switzerland and a year later I followed him and got to live wild and free like them, it was amazing. And one day I came back and there were rumours that our mother had found a boyfriend. Imagine my surprise when it was him, the wild and free guitar playing dude from across the river! And eventually my friend from school turned into my stepbrother, moved in with my mom, lived in my room. It was mysterious and magical and then to see him and his father struggle with my mom, the changes they brought about, it was a miracle.</p>

<p>So, my man, wherever you are, here&rsquo;s to you and your last trip, to your guitars and flutes, your love of music and freedom, your spirit of independence and love of people and aliens. Cheers! I hope to see you again.</p>

## Testing Raspberry Pi's AI Kit - 13 TOPS for $70

## Andreas Kling steps down from SerenityOS to focus entirely on the Ladybird browser

date: 2024-06-03, from: OS News

We&#8217;ve got some possibly sad, possibly great news. Today, Andreas Kling, the amazing developer who started SerenityOS as a way to regain a sense or normalcy after completing his drug rehab program, has announced he&#8217;s stepping down as the &#8216;big dictator for life&#8217; of the SerenityOS project, handing leadership over the maintainer group. The other half of the coin, however, is that Kling will officially fork Ladybird, the cross-platform web browser that originated as part of SerenityOS, turning it into a proper, separate project. Personally, for the past two years, I&#8217;ve been almost entirely focused on Ladybird, a new web browser that started as a simple HTML viewer for SerenityOS. When Ladybird became a cross-platform project in 2022, I switched all my attention to the Linux version, as testing on Linux was much easier and didn&#8217;t require booting into SerenityOS. Time flew by, and now I can&#8217;t remember the last time I worked on something in SerenityOS that wasn&#8217;t related to Ladybird. ↫ Andreas Kling If you know a little bit about Kling&#8217;s career, it&#8217;s not entirely surprising that his heart lies with working on a browser engine. He originally worked at Nokia, and then at Apple in San Francisco on WebKit, and there&#8217;s most likely some code that he&#8217;s written in the browser you&#8217;re using right now (except, perhaps, for us Firefox users). As such, it makes sense that once Ladybird grew into something more than just a simple HTML viewer, he&#8217;d be focusing on it a lot. As part of the fork, Ladybird will focus entirely on Linux and macOS, and drop SerenityOS as a target. This may seem weird at first, but this is an entirely amicable and planned step, as this allows Ladybird to adopt, use, and integrate third party code, something SerenityOS does not allow. In addition, many of these open source projects Ladybird couldn&#8217;t really use anyway because they simply didn&#8217;t exist for SerenityOS in the first place. This decision creates a lot of breathing room and flexibility for both projects. Ladybird was getting a lot of attention from outside of SerenityOS circles, from large donations to code contributions. I&#8217;m not entirely surprised by this step, and I really hope it&#8217;s going to be the beginning of something great. We really need new and competitive browser engines to push the web forward, and alongside Servo, it now seems Ladybird has also picked up the baton. What this will mean for SerenityOS remains to be seen. As Kling said, he hasn&#8217;t really been involved with SerenityOS outside of Ladybird work for two years now, so it seems the rest of the contributors were already doing a lot of the heavy lifting. I hope this doesn&#8217;t mean the project will peter out, since it has a certain flair few other operating systems have.

## Redox replaces core applications with COSMIC applications

date: 2024-06-03, from: OS News

Another month, another Redox progress report. The Rust-based operating system, headed by system76 engineer Jeremy Soller, has made a big move by replacing Redox&#8217; Orbital file manager, text editor and terminal by their COSMIC counterparts, COSMIC Files, COSMIC Editor and COSMIC Terminal, in the default Redox installation. COSMIC is the Rust-based desktop environment system76 is currently developing for their Linux distribution, Pop!_OS. You really have to start wondering what the long-term goals for Redox really are here. I&#8217;m not saying they&#8217;re intending to replace Linux with it &#8211; that&#8217;d be suicide &#8211; but the steady progress towards a general purpose operating system is undeniable.

## Libadwaita: splitting GTK and design language

date: 2024-06-03, from: OS News

There&#8217;s no denying that not everyone is happy with the state of the GTK world, and I, too, have argued that GNOME&#8217;s massive presence and seeming unwillingness to cooperate with or even consider the existence of other GTK-based desktop environments is doing real, measurable harm to the likes of Xfce, Cinnamon, and others. A major root cause is a feeling that GTK is nothing but a vessel for GNOME, and that the project doesn&#8217;t really seem to care much about anyone else. GNOME Foundation member and all-round very kind person Hari Rana, also known as TheEvilSkeleton, penned a blog post highlighting the other side of the story. In essence, what it comes down to, according to Rana, is that it&#8217;s better for everyone if GNOME-specific widgets are moved out of GTK, and into something else &#8211; first libhandy, and now its succesor libadwaita, splitting the toolkit (GTK) from the design language (libadwaita). This allows GNOME developers to focus on, well, GNOME, and frees up time for GTK developers to focus on generic widgets that aren&#8217;t specific to GNOME. Thanks to the removal of GNOME widgets from GTK 4, GTK developers can continue to work on general-purpose widgets, without being influenced or restricted in any way by the GNOME HIG. Developers of cross-platform GTK 3 apps that rely exclusively on general-purpose widgets can be more confident that GTK 4 won’t remove these widgets, and hopefully enjoy the benefits that GTK 4 offers. ↫ Hari Rana From a GNOME standpoint, this makes perfect sense, and I can obviously see the benefits for them. However, what this entire post seems to ignore is that the main effect of the split between GTK 4 and libadwaita is that various GTK applications, now targeting libadwaita because of GNOME&#8217;s immense popularity, simply no longer integrate very well with other desktops, like Xfce or Cinnamon. GNOME is, of course, under no obligation to remedy this situation, but at the very least they could acknowledge this is a very real problem that their fellow developers working on Xfce, Cinnamon, MATE, and others, have to deal with. It works the other way around too. Developers targeting the Linux desktop, where GNOME is more or less the default, have to choose between making a GTK application that integrates well with GNOME by opting for libadwaita and leaving non-GNOME users with a crappy experience, or opting for &#8216;pure&#8217; GTK 4 and leaving GNOME users with a worse experience. Neither option is good for the Linux desktop as a whole. The very real ripple effects of GNOME&#8217;s choices regarding GTK and libadwaita are seemingly being stubbornly ignored, neglected, and often not even acknowledged at all, and it&#8217;s no surprise this creates an immense amount of friction in the wider desktop Linux community. It just feels smug and careless, and of course that&#8217;s going to rub people the wrong way- regardless of the purity of your intentions.

If you make a podcast client, I'd like to have an <a href="https://opml.org/spec2.opml#subscriptionLists">OPML list</a> of all the feeds I'm subscribed to in my client so I can follow it in my feed reader. I'd really like it to go the other way, actually, so I could maintain the list on my desktop computer, and have it automatically reflected in the mobile podcast client. It's very important that it use OPML, that's the standard for this stuff. I couldn't possibly get excited by another format. Podcasting thrives on these standards. The client I use is <a href="https://pocketcasts.com/">Pocket Casts</a> which is part of Automattic.

But even if Google took it over tomorrow, I'd be happy with the outcome. It's been over 20 years since we rolled it out, and it's still delivering huge value to lots of people, and isn't controlled by anyone, as far as I can tell there are no gatekeepers.

## They might not make it

date: 2024-06-03, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>Months ago I ranted about <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/a-rant-on-arc-search">Arc Search</a>. My thoughts on the subject have not changed. Not long after that post, the fun people at The Browser Company released a teaser video for an upcoming 5 video series called “WE MIGHT NOT MAKE IT”. And guess what? My blog post made a brief cameo in the trailer, right after Casey Newton, something I found amusing. Anyway, the series was supposed to make fun of all the people who criticise what TBC is doing with their Arc browser and highlight all the reasons why they’re not going to make it. I guess that’s because they’re so confident in their product and are probably sure that they will, in fact, make it, whatever that means.</p>
<p>Well, it’s June. The teaser video came out on March 21st, the second episode on March 22nd, and the third on April 4th. I’m still waiting for a new one to come out but I guess they might not make it to the end of their planned 5 videos series. Oh well.</p>
<p>Unrelated but can I just say that I find the name of the company itself quite baffling? It’s called The Browser Company but what they make is a wrapper around the Chromium web browser. So the browser company is making everything but the actual browser. Can you imagine starting a company called “the pizza company” and then outsourcing the pizza part to a 3rd party? So bizarre.</p>
<p>Anyway, TBC people, if you’re reading this, I look forward to your next video about how you “ruined the internet” and also very much look forward to the one about how you “listen to your members” considering you never replied to the two emails I sent to your support.</p>                <hr>

One of the flaws in the design of Teslas is they are really difficult to operate safely for people who are farsighted, such as myself. A lot of the <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/03/teslascreen.png">status messages</a> are too small for me to read without reading glasses, and in the time it takes to put them on the message is gone. Esp frustrating for the messages that tell you to do this or that to keep using FSD. And when I'm flipping the glasses down, my eyes are not on the road Mr or Ms Tesla. This is a design problem. Maybe you should use voice prompts for this kind of stuff. Or use a camera to see if my hands are on the wheel.

I've been using libraries my whole life, going back to when I was a child. I worked with card catalogs and non-virtual book collections. Archives of news on film. View ChatGPT on that timeline and you'll see its significance. You didn't write it, I didn't. Each of us may have contributed a little, and <i>isn't that what we want?</i> To help build the base of human knowledge? It gives our lives meaning. Sometimes I wonder how much value people place on themselves and so little on progress. I think we all want our lives to have meaning. Well here you go, it doesn't get more meaningful than this.

## AMD unveils Ryzen 9000 CPUs for desktop, Zen 5 takes center stage at Computex 2024

date: 2024-06-03, from: OS News

In regards to performance, AMD is touting an average (geomean) IPC increase in desktop workloads for Zen 5 of 16%. And with the new desktop Ryzen chips&#8217; turbo clockspeeds remaining largely identical to their Ryzen 7000 predecessors, this should translate into similar performance expectations for the new chips. The AMD Ryzen 9000 series will also launch on the AM5 socket, which debuted with AMD&#8217;s Ryzen 7000 series and marks AMD&#8217;s commitment to socket/platform longevity. Along with the Ryzen 9000 series will come a pair of new high-performance chipsets: the X870E (Extreme) and the regular X870 chipsets. The fundamental features that vendors will integrate into their specific motherboards remain tight-lipped. Still, we do know that USB 4.0 ports are standard on the X870E/X870 boards, along with PCIe 5.0 for both PCIe graphics and NVMe storage, with higher AMD EXPO memory profile support expected than previous generations. ↫ Gavin Bonshor at AnandTech I absolutely love that AMD maintains compatibility with its chipset and socket generations as well as it does. I&#8217;m currently running a Ryzen 9 7900X, and I see no reason to upgrade any time soon, but it&#8217;s good to know I&#8217;ll at least have otions once the time comes. Compare this to Intel, which broke compatibility pretty much intentionally almost every generation for years now, and this is a huge win for consumers. Of course, as AMD regains more and more of its foothold across the market, it will eventually also resort to the kind of tactics Intel has been using while it pretty much had the market to itself. It&#8217;s only a matter of time before we&#8217;ll see the first new Ryzen generation that mysteriously requires a new socket or chipset out of the blue.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-06-03, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

We should apply mathematics to language design. The goal of the language should be maximum simplicity for the human developer. As much of the complexity as possible should be handled by software, either at compile-time or runtime. It should strive to read like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode">pseudocode</a>. We started out writing code by toggling switches on the front panel of the computer, and for a few decades we were factoring and making it simpler with every iteration, but then we turned around in the other direction. I am from the church of factoring. I do it in my designs of products at all levels, and I treat languages with the same care. It turns out all the rules of working on open systems also apply to language design. I plan to write more about this.

## Tock: a secure embedded operating system for microcontrollers

date: 2024-06-03, from: OS News

Tock is an embedded operating system designed for running multiple concurrent, mutually distrustful applications on Cortex-M and RISC-V based embedded platforms. Tock&#8217;s design centers around protection, both from potentially malicious applications and from device drivers. Tock uses two mechanisms to protect different components of the operating system. First, the kernel and device drivers are written in Rust, a systems programming language that provides compile-time memory safety and type safety. Tock uses Rust to protect the kernel (e.g. the scheduler and hardware abstraction layer) from platform specific device drivers as well as isolate device drivers from each other. Second, Tock uses memory protection units to isolate applications from each other and the kernel. ↫ Tock GitHub page We&#8217;ve never featured Tock on OSNews before, as far as I can tell, which seems odd considering it&#8217;s been around for a while. The most recent release stems from January 2023, so a short while ago, but that&#8217;s not too surprising considering the target audience of this embedded operating system. It&#8217;s licensed under either Apache or MIT.

<p>We spent this month moving northward through both southern and northern British Columbia. We've been moving almost every day, stopping every night to anchor, sleep and recuperate. Sailing near land is not as relaxing as sailing offshore, this reef-strewn coast requires careful navigation. We've had many long days of endless tacking from one side of the channel to the other, almost all the way to Port McNeill, then after that we started to get more weather from the south for some mostly pleasant, but cold and rainy, downwind sailing. We've been using our woodstove a lot, in evenings it helps warm the boat after a long sail.</p>

<p>On May 29th, 623 nautical miles miles after leaving Victoria, we arrived in Prince Rupert, our last major port in British Columbia before we head north to Southeast Alaska. Then, on June 2nd, we arrived in Ketchikan, Southeast Alaska. Most of our updates this month detail some of the places we've been(see the above list). To see our path, look at <a href="https://100r.co/site/western_canada.htm">Western Canada</a> and <a href="https://100r.co/site/us_se_alaska.html">us se alaska</a>. We update the map as we find internet.</p>

<p>We've seen sea otters, lots of humpback whales, two pods of orcas(one pod had a baby tagging along), eagles, and lots of mountains. In other non-travel related news, Devine is going to speak again at <a href="https://handmadecities.com/seattle/" target="_blank">Handmade Seattle</a> this upcoming November!</p>

<h3>Pino book & movie club</h3>

<p><b>Book Club:</b> This month we are reading The Martian by Andy Weir.</p>

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/02/librarian.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">To people who say you get wrong answers from ChatGPT, if I wanted my car to kill me I could drive into oncoming traffic. If I wanted my calculator to give me incorrect results I could press the wrong keys. In other words, ChatGPT is a very new tool. It can be hard to control, you have to check what it says, and try different questions. But the result, if you pay attention and don't drive it under the wheels of a bus, is that you can do things you never could do before.

## Saying a lot while saying nothing at all about Ansible AWX

date: 2024-06-02, from: Jeff Geerling blog

<span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Saying a lot while saying nothing at all about Ansible AWX</span>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>A few days ago, the post <a href="https://www.ansible.com/blog/upcoming-changes-to-the-awx-project/">Upcoming Changes to the AWX Project</a> came across my feed. An innocuous title, but sometimes community-impacting changes are buried in posts like this. So, as an interested Ansible user, I read through the post.</p>

<p>In 1,610 words, almost nothing of substance was written.</p>

<p>A lot about how it's not 2014 anymore, so 2014-era architecture doesn't suit AWX. Then a big bold disclaimer at the bottom:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Before we conclude, we should be clear about what will not happen.</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>We are not changing the Ansible project</li>
  <li>We are not adjusting our OSS license structure</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Ultimately, we need to make some changes to the way our systems work and our projects are structured. Not a rewrite but a refactoring and restructuring of how some of the core components connect and communicate with each other.</p></blockquote></div>

<a href="https://www.threads.net/@mossbergwalt/post/C7rli4JJ3St">Walt Mossberg shows</a> why ChatGPT is such a conversation-starter, and thus is incredible art. He asked it to draw a picture of himself with Kara Swisher. Of course everyone did that, and posted the result to the thread. The variety of responses is amazing, revealing of what I'm not sure. Here's <a href="https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/C7uYdAcJpTQ">the one</a> it came up with for me.

## Burning book festivals is not a climate solution

date: 2024-06-02, from: Hannah Richie at Substack

We need better conversations &#8211; not pressured boycotts &#8211; to drive climate action.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-06-02, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

I bet you could do a beautifully readable blog by just dynamically rendering its RSS feed.  Why bother statically rendering the home page, month page, day page or pages for each individual post. Dynamic servers are so cheap these days.

Ken Smith pointed out the story in the <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/05/31/123255.html#a125308">very last postscript</a>. Before that, I hadn't put it together that podcasting worked because for a while Adam did my job, and for a while I did his. That guaranteed two things -- that the technology would be maximally simple, and that anyone with a computer could do the whole recording and production job without help from an expensive studio. In both cases the result was nowhere near commercial standards, but that didn't matter, in fact it helped that there were so many glitches in my early podcasts, that said that hey if this guy can do it, so can I.

## This message does not exist

date: 2024-06-02, from: OS News

The act of discarding a message that does not exist must therefore do one of two things. It may cause the message contents to also cease to exist. Alternately, it might not affect the existence but only the accessibility of message contents. Perhaps they continue to exist, but discarding the message (which already did not exist) causes the copy operation to cease being invokable on the message contents (even though they do continue to exist). The story of existence has many mysteries. ↫ Mark J. Nelson The one question that can really break my brain in a way that is feels like it&#8217;s physically hurting &#8211; which it can&#8217;t, because, fun fact, there&#8217;s no pain receptors in the brain &#8211; is the question what exists outside of the universe? Any answer you can come up with just leads to more questions which just lead to more questions, in an infinite loop of possible answers and questions that the human mind is not equipped to grasp. Anyway, it turns out using Outook can lead to the same existential crises.

The worst part about having a felon in the White House is that he's probably committing felonies while he's in the freaking White House.
