## UI = f(statesⁿ)

date: 2024-02-16, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>“UI is a function of state” is a pretty popular saying in the front-end world. In context (<em>pun intended</em>), that’s typically referring to application or component state. I thought I’d pull that thread a little further and explore all the states that can effect the UI layer…</p>
<h2>First-party application states</h2>
<p>Every application whether it’s a to-do list or a shopping cart or some radically complex app will have some state. State isn’t uniform and typically exists at a variety of different levels. We’ll start at the top and drill down…</p>
<h3>Global state</h3>
<p>Data stores and feature gating that typically happens at the application level.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stores - different locations for storing data
<ul>
<li>Application store - Redux, Vuex, Mobx, Signals</li>
<li>Browser store - localStorage, sessionStorage, cookies, IndexedDB</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Data - different types of global data
<ul>
<li>Access control data - authentication tokens, paid/unpaid, geolocated, age, verified, member, etc.</li>
<li>User data - name, icon, etc</li>
<li>Collections - e.g. list of posts</li>
<li>Session data</li>
<li>… etc</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Page/Component state</h3>
<p>Vince Speelman’s wonderful <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/the-nine-states-of-design-5bfe9b3d6d85">Nine States of Design</a> do a great job summing up all the states that a page or component might exist in.</p>
<ul>
<li>Nothing - An empty element</li>
<li>Loading - A <code>fetch</code> is happening</li>
<li>None - No items returned</li>
<li>One - A single item comes back</li>
<li>Some - A few items comes back</li>
<li>Too Many - Too many items, need pagination (or similar)</li>
<li>Incorrect - An error occurred</li>
<li>Correct - A success happened</li>
<li>Done - The operation finished</li>
</ul>
<p>Vince’s list is perfect to me and keeps being relevant after all these years, I would add two items.</p>
<ul>
<li>Custom states - Any bespoke or custom states relevant to your application</li>
<li>Realtime multi-player event mesages- Picture the state and event message in a chat app or realtime stock ticker. Stored at the component level or thrown into global state.</li>
</ul>
<p>In my experience both the page and each component will contain some mixture of these states as well as being reactive to global state changes.</p>
<h3>Element state</h3>
<p>Individual elements can (and will) have their own states. At this layer, features of HTML, CSS, and ARIA start to reveal themselves.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/cursor">Cursor</a> state
<ul>
<li><code>default, pointer, wait, text, move, grab, crosshair, zoom-in, zoom-out</code>, … etc</li>
<li>Custom cursors</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Stacking context
<ul>
<li><code>z-index</code></li>
<li>Layer
<ul>
<li>Root</li>
<li><code>::backdrop</code></li>
<li>Top</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Attribute states - states reflected in HTML
<ul>
<li>Visibility = <code>hidden, visible</code></li>
<li>Language = <code>dir, lang</code></li>
<li>Functionaltiy = <code>contenteditable, draggable, invoketarget</code></li>
<li>Display = <code>inert, open, popover</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes">Pseudo-class</a> states - states reflected in CSS
<ul>
<li>Action = <code>:hover, :active, :focus, :focus-visible, :focus-within</code></li>
<li>Input = <code>:autofill, :checked, :disabled, :valid, :invalid, :user-valid, :user-invalid, :required</code>, … etc.</li>
<li>Display = <code>:fullscreen, :modal, :picture-in-picture</code></li>
<li>Language = <code>:dir(), :lang()</code></li>
<li>Location = <code>:link, :visited, :target</code>, … etc.</li>
<li>Resource = <code>:playing, :paused</code></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CustomStateSet">CustomStateSet</a> = custom states for web components</li>
<li>… etc</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes">ARIA states</a> - <a href="https://css-tricks.com/user-facing-state/">user-facing states</a> reflected in ARIA
<ul>
<li><code>aria-current</code></li>
<li><code>aria-expanded</code></li>
<li><code>aria-pressed</code></li>
<li><code>aria-hidden</code></li>
<li>… etc</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Second-party user (or device) states</h2>
<p>The user of the application and their device, peripherals, and browser have a lot of say in how the final application renders. This is by design and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html-design-principles/#priority-of-constituencies">built into the foundations of the web</a>.</p>
<h3>Language and localization</h3>
<p>Surprise! Not all users live in US-West-2.</p>
<ul>
<li>Text direction = <code>ltr, rtl</code></li>
<li>Writing mode = <code>horizontal-tb, vertical-lr, vertical-rl</code></li>
<li>Distance to server/CDN (latency)</li>
<li>Auto-translations</li>
<li>Words are long (e.g. German)</li>
<li>Words are short (e.g. Chinese)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Device constraints</h3>
<p>A user’s device has a lot of variation and customization and may be your biggest unknown bottleneck for rendering to glass.</p>
<ul>
<li>Network connection = Fiber, cable, wi-fi, 5G, 4G, 3G, “<a href="https://web.dev/articles/performance-poor-connectivity#lie-fi">lie-fi</a>”</li>
<li>Viewport = <code>height, width, initial-scale, horizontal-viewport-segments, vertical-viewport-segments, viewport-segment-width, viewport-segment-height</code>, … etc.</li>
<li>Environment contstants = <code>safe-area-inset-*</code>, <code>titlebar-area-*</code>, <code>keyboard-inset-*</code>(e.g, <a href="https://css-tricks.com/the-notch-and-css/">iPhone Notch</a>, rounded corners, <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/breaking-out-of-the-box/">installed apps</a>)</li>
<li>Pixel density = 1x, 2x (Retina), 3x, … etc.</li>
<li>Low-power mode</li>
<li>Screen brightness</li>
<li>CPU speed</li>
<li>GPU/dGPU</li>
<li>L1/L2/L3 cache</li>
<li>CPU/GPU/Memory contention (e.g., other apps open)</li>
<li>Color-gamut support = Rec2020, P3, sRGB, …etc</li>
<li>Keyboard = Embedded, External, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T9_(predictive_text)">T9</a>, Virtual On-screen, Touchbar, … etc</li>
<li>XR support = <code>inline, immersive-vr, immersive-ar</code></li>
</ul>
<h3>Modalities</h3>
<p>Users aren’t uniform in how they interact with their devices and may be using one or any combination of inputs and outputs all at once.</p>
<ul>
<li>Inputs
<ul>
<li>Mouse = one-button, two-button, mousewheel, trackball, touchpad, high/low DPI</li>
<li>Keyboard = 100%, 60%, 10-key, querty, colemak, Ergonomic, split, mechanical, … etc</li>
<li>Touch/Tap = coarse pointer, no hover</li>
<li>Stylus = fine pointer, hover, pressure sensitivity</li>
<li>Gestures = pinch-zoom, two/three/four-finger swipe</li>
<li>Motion = accelleration, shake-to-undo, bump, … etc</li>
<li>Orientation = landscape, portrait, alpha/beta/gamma (360º/180º/90º, respectively) rotation</li>
<li>Speech recognition = Dragon NaturallySpeaking, voice assistants</li>
<li>Switches = button, sip, puff</li>
<li>Eye-tracking</li>
<li>Gamepad</li>
<li>XR = 3 DOF, 6 DOF</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Outputs
<ul>
<li>Screen</li>
<li>Text-to-speech</li>
<li>Screen reader</li>
<li>Braille</li>
<li>Screen magnifier</li>
<li>Vibration</li>
<li>RSS?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Browser states</h3>
<p>Finally, a user’s browser choice and preferred plugins determines a lot about how they experience (or would prefer to experience) your UI and your application can be responsive to some of those preferences.</p>
<ul>
<li>User preferences
<ul>
<li>prefers-color-scheme = light, dark, forced-colors</li>
<li>prefers-reduced-motion = reduce, no-preference</li>
<li>prefers-reduced-transparency = reduce, no-preference</li>
<li>user zoom = 100% to 400%</li>
<li>text size = small to x-large</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Features and functionality
<ul>
<li>Browser version = latest version, last 2 versions, older</li>
<li>Feature detection = <code>@support</code> or polyfills</li>
<li>Color-gamut support = Rec2020, P3, sRGB, …etc</li>
<li>Browser cache hit</li>
<li>Service worker hit</li>
<li>Display mode = fullscreen | standalone | minimal-ui | browser</li>
<li><code>beforeinstallprompt</code></li>
<li>Print mode</li>
<li>Reader mode</li>
<li>JavaScript disabled = yes, I actually know people who do this.</li>
<li>Sleeping tabs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Permissions
<ul>
<li>Camera = true, false</li>
<li>Microphone = true, false</li>
<li>Geolocation = allowed, not allowed, only while using the app</li>
<li>Notifications = true, false</li>
<li>File access = true, false</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Plugins
<ul>
<li>Ad blockers - UBlock, Safari ITP, Ghostery, … etc</li>
<li>Custom plugins/Boosts</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>User states</h3>
<p>Thus far we’ve talked about technology, now let’s consider the actual human being at the other end of the transaction. A user’s physical or mental state impact their cognitive or literal bandwidth to enjoy your experience.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2016/01/25/designing-for-crisis-design-for-real-life/">Having an emergency/crisis</a></li>
<li>Cognitive impairment</li>
<li>Permanently or temporarily disabled</li>
<li><a href="https://butyoudontlooksick.com/articles/written-by-christine/the-spoon-theory/">“Out of spoons”</a></li>
<li>Inside or outside</li>
<li>On a plane or train</li>
<li>In the city or in the woods</li>
</ul>
<h2>Third-party service states</h2>
<p>Third parties have an outsized impact on the user experience of a UI.</p>
<h3>Availability/Status</h3>
<p>The status/availability/uptime of other servers is the biggest surface area for failure for a UI.</p>
<ul>
<li>Server hardware status = online, offline, partial availability</li>
<li>Database status = online, offline, transaction locked</li>
<li>API status = online, offline, partial availability</li>
<li>Web font service = online, offline, partial availability</li>
<li>DNS status = may take up to 72 hours to resolve</li>
<li>Package dependencies = working, broken, malicious injection, protestware, … etc</li>
<li>Asset delivery and caching status
<ul>
<li>Cloudflare</li>
<li>S3</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Script injections</h3>
<p>Third-party script injections are the biggest contributor to performance degradation on a UI. Some services even take over the user experience of an application. This is often out of your control.</p>
<ul>
<li>Analytics/tracking services</li>
<li>User session recording services</li>
<li>A/B test injections</li>
<li>Instructional overlays</li>
<li>Accessibility overlays</li>
<li>Third-party authentication (OAuth) services</li>
<li>Captcha/verification services</li>
</ul>
<p>You haven’t truly lived life until one of these unchecked services takes down an application.</p>
<h2>There’s more to UI than just state…</h2>
<p>I’m sure I’ve forgotten whole categories of state. I haven’t even gotten into the hundreds of CSS properties and the thousands of values and their potential conflicts. I didn’t talk about the intricacies of styling form controls or building dropdowns with the required ARIA property combinations. I didn’t touch on <a href="https://cloudfour.com/thinks/responsive-images-101-definitions/">the decision matrix required to put an image on the page</a>. Nor does this get into <a href="https://github.com/joshbuchea/HEAD">setting all the proper tags in the <code>head</code></a> <a href="https://rviscomi.github.io/capo.js/">in the right order</a>. Nor does this discuss <a href="https://microformats.org/">microformats</a> for SEO or all the code you need to properly setup a UI to send analtyics data.</p>
<p>In closing, hire people who are good at UI.</p>

## P&B: Peter Rukavina

date: 2024-02-16, from: Manu - I write blog

<p>This is the 25th edition of <em>People and Blogs</em>, the series where I ask interesting people to talk about themselves and their blogs. Today we have Peter Rukavina and his blog, <a href="https://ruk.ca">ruk.ca</a></p>
<p>I don't remember how I stumbled on Peter's blog to be honest with you. It might have been on Hacker News or maybe someone sent it to me. I remember loving its very personal nature. His blog is the type of personal blog I enjoy the most: just an endless stream of content spanning across an array of topics. Also, he has quite the history on that site considering the oldest post is from 1999 but the archive contains also content from the early to mid 90s as well as some pieces of digital media from the 60s! That's an eternity in the digital world.</p>
<p>To follow this series <a href="https://peopleandblogs.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">subscribe to the newsletter</a>. A new interview will land in your inbox every Friday.

<div class="q"><p><strong>Let&#039;s start from the basics: can you introduce yourself?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>I am an inveterately curious person, with a lifelong passion for words (writing them, reading them, typesetting them, binding them together). In the mid-1980s, after an aborted attempt at college, where I never found my mojo, I set off on a career as a coder and a graphic designer. I apprenticed in the composing room of a daily newsletter. I designed posters for a modern dance company. I learned to design books. I created database systems for apartment buildings, for a palæontologist, and for a tire store.</p>
<p>When the web came along in the 1990s, I embraced it, and was part of the very early efforts in organizing and displaying government information to the public, along the way becoming interested in open source software and open data, and becoming an advocate for both. Professionally, I settled into a position maintaining the infrastructure of <a href="http://almanac.com/">Almanac.com</a>, the website of <em>The Old Farmer’s Almanac</em>, a platform that gave me great latitude to explore whatever the web frontier of the moment was, working with a venerable publication to help it chart its course beyond print. </p>
<p>About a decade ago, while continuing digital work, I started to become interested in letterpress printing—an embrace of print in its purest form. I run a small letterpress shop, Queen Square Press, based in a church basement, and let my creativity take me where it leads me, producing posters, broadsides, cards, and ephemera, mostly to scratch my own itches.</p>
<p>This year, after thinking about it for a long time, I decided to step away from digital work altogether. It was a hard decision: I’d been working with a great team, on interesting projects, for more than 25 years. I was well-paid, in control of my own schedule. I had no complaints. But I knew in my heart of hearts that I wanted to try something else. What? I don’t know.</p>
<p>This decision to transition can, in part, be explained by my being four years a widower, being the father of a 23 year old autistic trans woman, and, recently, burgeoning stepfather to a delightful 12 year old, and partner to her mother, a fascinating, creative, woman who challenges and delights me every day. All of this change swirling around me has opened me up and allowed me to relax into new possibilities.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>What&#039;s the story behind your blog?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>In 1999 I found myself writing an “about” page for my tiny web business, then called Digital Island. I watched myself falling into familiar “about page” tropes — “Digital Island is a leading provider of innovative solutions for… blah blah blah…” — and thought, inspired by early bloggers who were emerging around the time, perhaps I’d, instead, create a place to write about myself, my interests, my work, my life. I wrote a tiny CMS in PHP, and made <a href="https://ruk.ca/content/digital-island-gets-reinvented">my first post</a> in May 1999, a simple announcement that I was changing my company name.</p>
<p>I started off slowly, making only 13 posts the first year, but gradually developed an approach, and a style, and a notion of “the kinds of things I blog about” (travel, personal projects, my family, local businesses, my eccentricities), to the point, almost 25 years later, where it’s become interwoven into my emotional life, a way of organizing my thoughts about things, of explaining things to <em>myself</em> by way of explaining them to my readership.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>What does your creative process look like when it comes to blogging?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>I generally write in real time: an idea occurs to me, and the idea takes on a life of its own, gets “called to be written about,” and I try to carve out the time to do so right away. I don’t find the process of writing onerous; generally words flow out of me, and while I will go back and edit the words, finessing the meaning, correcting errors, what emerges is generally fairly close to what I wrote down in the first place.</p>
<p>I write a lot of posts via email, a capability that has allowed me to take my writing out of “sitting in front of a laptop” and, really, <em>anywhere</em> I’m struck. Writing on a tiny iPhone SE isn’t the best and most natural environment (though voice-to-text helps), but the benefit of being able to "strike while the iron is hot" outweighs the fussiness of the tool. These days perhaps half of what I write is on the phone.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe the physical space influences your creativity?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>My blogging flourishes, as does my life, when I’m on the road. I love writing about my travels, of seeing new things, meeting new people. And so “away” is the ideal creative environment. That said, as I’ve been remaking my days, stepping away from an office with a desk and a chair, what “away” means can be as close as the public library or coffee shop up the street.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your tech stack?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>After running my home-brew PHP blogging engine for many years, I eventually migrated to using Drupal, and have been using Drupal ever since. This was partly for professional reasons — <a href="http://almanac.com/">Almanac.com</a> is a Drupal site, so I've wanted to “eat my own dogfood” on my personal site — and partly because I found Drupal a nice balance of canned and extendable. </p>
<p>My ability to blog-by-email is enabled by <a href="https://postmarkapp.com/">Postmark</a>, which fires a web hook upon receiving email to a dedicated email address; the web hook fires some custom code on my server that uses the Drupal API to create a new post.</p>
<p>The site is hosted on an AWS EC2 instance, running MySQL and Apache.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would you do anything differently?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>As I’m stepping away from coding professionally, I find myself at a crossroads: I’ve always believed deeply in owning and managing as much of my own technology stack as possible (I only migrated away from running my own mail server in recent memory), and I like the flexibility of “I’ll just code up a Drupal module to do that.” </p>
<p>But I’m trying to spend <em>less</em> time at the keyboard, and things that fascinated me at one point I now find technical drudgery, to the point where I might go looking for a home for my writing that I don’t need to care and feed so frequently, a place where I can just focus on writing.</p>
<p>But rewinding back to the beginning, no, I don’t think I’d do anything differently. I’ve loved my blog, and writing, for a long time; it’s part of me.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>Financial question since the web is obsessed with money: how much does it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost or does it generate some revenue? And what&#039;s your position on people monetising personal blogs?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>In the early days of Google Adsense <a href="https://ruk.ca/content/content-targetted-google-ads">I ran ads on the blog</a>, and because the web was smaller, and I had a deep archive with good organic SEO, I made good money doing so. </p>
<p>But I gradually became uncomfortable with my own words, often deeply personal words, being surrounded by ads for who-knows-what, and so eventually turned off the ads entirely, and I’ve been ad-free (and analytics, and tracking free) ever since. I feel confident in this decision.</p>
<p>I generally read <em>other</em> blogs with an RSS reader (currently <a href="https://readwise.io/read">Readwise Reader</a>, which I love; formerly <a href="https://freshrss.org/index.html">FreshRSS</a> and, like everyone else, Google Reader before that), I almost never see advertising on blogs, so it’s opaque to me. </p>
<p>It costs me about $50/month to host my blog on AWS; I’ve got a long-festering to-do list item to optimize and lower this, but it has yet to rise to the top of the list.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth checking out? And also, who do you think I should be interviewing next?</strong></p></div>

**@Jessica Smith's blog** (date: 2024-02-16, from: Jessica Smith's blog)

<p>I wish there was a federated, ActivityPub-based LiveJournal. I know there&rsquo;s stuff like <a href="https://write.as">write.as<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&thinsp;<svg style="height: 0.7em; width: 0.7em;" focusable="false" data-prefix="fas" data-icon="external-link-alt" class="svg-inline--fa fa-external-link-alt fa-w-16" role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><title>(external link)</title><path fill="currentColor" d="M432,320H400a16,16,0,0,0-16,16V448H64V128H208a16,16,0,0,0,16-16V80a16,16,0,0,0-16-16H48A48,48,0,0,0,0,112V464a48,48,0,0,0,48,48H400a48,48,0,0,0,48-48V336A16,16,0,0,0,432,320ZM488,0h-128c-21.37,0-32.05,25.91-17,41l35.73,35.73L135,320.37a24,24,0,0,0,0,34L157.67,377a24,24,0,0,0,34,0L435.28,133.32,471,169c15,15,41,4.5,41-17V24A24,24,0,0,0,488,0Z"></path></svg></span></a> but it&rsquo;s not really what I&rsquo;m envisioning. What I basically want is a blog, where I can make occasional friends-only posts (<strong>not</strong> private or password-protected posts), and take advantage of ActivityPub for authenticating my friends. A Dreamwidth-like distinction between true &ldquo;friends&rdquo; and more distant &ldquo;subscribers&rdquo; wouldn&rsquo;t go amiss, either. And &ldquo;access list&rdquo; posting, if you only want certain subsets of your friends to see.</p>
<p>Maybe this is something for which one could look to <a href="https://bonfirenetworks.org/">Bonfire<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&thinsp;<svg style="height: 0.7em; width: 0.7em;" focusable="false" data-prefix="fas" data-icon="external-link-alt" class="svg-inline--fa fa-external-link-alt fa-w-16" role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><title>(external link)</title><path fill="currentColor" d="M432,320H400a16,16,0,0,0-16,16V448H64V128H208a16,16,0,0,0,16-16V80a16,16,0,0,0-16-16H48A48,48,0,0,0,0,112V464a48,48,0,0,0,48,48H400a48,48,0,0,0,48-48V336A16,16,0,0,0,432,320ZM488,0h-128c-21.37,0-32.05,25.91-17,41l35.73,35.73L135,320.37a24,24,0,0,0,0,34L157.67,377a24,24,0,0,0,34,0L435.28,133.32,471,169c15,15,41,4.5,41-17V24A24,24,0,0,0,488,0Z"></path></svg></span></a>? I mean, its ideas about &ldquo;Circles&rdquo; are pretty similar to what I&rsquo;m thinking of. It&rsquo;s still a bit more &ldquo;social media&rdquo; and less &ldquo;journal/blog&rdquo; than I&rsquo;m thinking, but I guess this blog is already like that anyway&hellip; 😅 Maybe I should make an account on their test instance and play around.</p>

## A dozen thoughts about AI

date: 2024-02-15, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>AI. It’s the talk of the town (or at least this year, that is). I’ve been in dozens of conversations about AI in recent days. The likelihood that the next big feature or product I build involves AI seems to be going up. No idea where it’s all headed – and reserve the right to change my mind – but a dozen conversations leaves me with a dozen or so disparate thoughts about this new frontier of technology.</p>
<hr />
<p>Can you spot the difference between these two images?</p>
<picture>
  <source media="(min-width: 600px)" srcset="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/smallteam-desktop.jpg"></source>
  <img srcset="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/smallteam-mobile.jpg" alt="Two images next to eachother, first is a small team with the caption 'A small team who wants to stay small but accomplish a bit more' and the second is the same small team with the caption 'A small team tasked with maximizing value for shareholders.'">
</picture>
<hr />
<p>AI was in the news this past month…</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-sam-altman-wants-seven-trillion-openai-compare-costs-2024-2">OpenAI needs $7 trillion dollars</a> (more than the US federal budget) to build new chips for AI</li>
<li><a href="https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/sam-altman-nuclear-fission-microreactors">OpenAI needs cheap energy from fission reactors</a> to be sustainable</li>
</ol>
<p>I mean, if I had $7 trillion dollars and access to free energy I could probably do some neat things too.</p>
<hr />
<p>Is non-deterministic search really what we want?</p>
<p>In a world where our social fabric is being torn by “alternative facts” and online bubbles, do we want to yield finding answers over to a machine known for making things up and is often wrong? Do your customers want this?</p>
<hr />
<p>People creating projects in the AI space look like they’re having fun. I cynically wonder if it’s fun because there’s freedom in low expectations <a href="https://bc.ctvnews.ca/air-canada-s-chatbot-gave-a-b-c-man-the-wrong-information-now-the-airline-has-to-pay-for-the-mistake-1.6769454">when you yield result quality to the outputs of a black box</a>. O to be a novel new technology!</p>
<hr />
<p>When AI autocompletes code I’m familiar with but don’t have loaded in my brain RAM, I love it. When AI writes boilerplate-laden tests for me and I can get back to the more fun building part but with more test coverage, I love it. When AI enables me to maintain flow, it’s magical.</p>
<p>But when I’m fighting the machine, guessing which mystery word combo unlocks the functionality I want… Ughck.</p>
<hr />
<p>Am I bad at prompt engineering? Is that why I don’t “get it”? I can never quite craft the right query to match what I see in my imagination. Am I asking the wrong questions or getting the wrong answers? Am I creating too high of a standard? Weird I’d even consider putting the blame on myself.</p>
<hr />
<p>A friend of mine told me how he used ChatGPT to answer questions in realtime during a job interview. As a hiring manager, I’d be appalled. As a friend, I thought “Do what you gotta do.”</p>
<p>I think he got the job.</p>
<hr />
<p>AI seems genuinely helpful for automating tedious tasks. For example, image background removal. That was painstaking and I don’t think anyone misses that part of their job anymore.</p>
<p>Another –and quite possibly my favorite– example of task automation is a story from Spider-man: Into the Spiderverse. <a href="https://youtu.be/l-wUKu_V2Lk?si=ApGfJWUEiK870Q1a&amp;t=340">In a video by Wired</a>, Josh Beveridge, the Head of Character Animation explains how they used machine learning to automate some of the linework to help the characters could come to life. It’s important to note this was artist informed and artist corrected…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All of that technology was in the service of allowing artists more freedom to do things by hand and it all became part of this hand-crafted feel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eliminating tedious work seems worthwhile. Humans getting to do more of the fun stuff. That famous “augmented work” everyone talks about.</p>
<p>But what is considered tedious? Email? Writing documentation? Blogging? Design? Making music? Hiring? Working with junior developers? How come management never comes up in these conversations? Oof.</p>
<hr />
<p>Alex Riviere recently wrote “<a href="https://alex.party/posts/2024-01-28-why-i-find-llms-frustrating">Why I find LLMs Frustrating</a>” where he highlights the duality of LLMs; how it’s bullshitting can be harmful but also useful for self-expression. Alex is finding success in tools like <a href="https://www.brainstory.ai/">Brainstory</a> to help craft a narrative and “format things in a way others will understand.”</p>
<p>As someone who hates being misunderstood and often smashes a dozen disparate ideas together (e.g., this post), I could benefit from a tool like that. As a tool for busy brains where the brain “goes faster than my fingers can write”, AI seems useful.</p>
<hr />
<p>The Verge had a wonderfully art directed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/23194235/ai-fiction-writing-amazon-kindle-sudowrite-jasper">post about indie writers using AI to write fiction</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Author was writing 6 books a year for Amazon 🚩</li>
<li>Customers drop off if books take more than 2 months 😬</li>
<li>Author wanted to get unblocked, so she used <a href="https://www.sudowrite.com/">Sudowrite</a> 👍</li>
<li>Author slowly starts yielding more to AI 😬</li>
<li>Author can’t remember plot, story beats, dialog ⚠️</li>
<li>AI generated content is creating more competition on Amazon 😬</li>
<li>Author is now writing 10 books a year 🚩🚩</li>
<li>Author is spending more revenue on Amazon ads to sell their books in a crowded market 😱</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>A recent whitepaper on Copilot suggested a <a href="https://www.gitclear.com/coding_on_copilot_data_shows_ais_downward_pressure_on_code_quality">downward pressure on code quality</a> because of a +39.2% increase in code churn. Most happening within two weeks. There’s <a href="https://adamcoster.com/blog/copilot-may-not-decrease-code-quality">some questions</a> and <a href="https://shively-sanders.com/gitclear-copilot-code-quality.html">good write-ups</a> <a href="https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2024/01/25/copilot-research.aspx">about this</a>, but this correlation is probably worth watching. <a href="https://joshcollinsworth.com/blog/copilot">Bad generated code may have more serious consequences</a>.</p>
<p>Anyways, I often wonder if the future of my job is just cleaning up all the robo-barf on the ship.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://alistapart.com/article/opportunities-for-ai-in-accessibility/">Aaron Gustafson wrote about AI for Accessibility</a>. I know Aaron has spent a lot of time thinking and working in this space, so I appreciate, trust, and value his perspective.</p>
<p>Attempting to <a href="https://daverupert.com/2017/10/a-good-science-fiction-story/">predict the traffic jam</a>, I worry automating accessibility would give way to a libertarian mindset where accessible technology is an individual’s concern, not an everybody responsibility and what externalities we do have in making accessible websites will go away. We already see this with overlay companies. Rather than fix issues at the source, we put the onus on the disabled person to figure out how to use a <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/spark/disabled-people-want-disability-design-not-disability-dongles-1.5353131">dongle</a> so they can buy underwear on the internet. That’s inequity.</p>
<p>At the same time, I want people to have tools to be able to fix their issues. People should be able to increase their own access if the designers and developers did a bad job.</p>
<p>“Hey Siri, I’m red-green colorblind, can you automatically fix every website for me”<br />
“Hey Siri, label this form because someone did a bad job”<br />
“Hey Siri, describe this chart”</p>
<hr />
<p>I often think about my dyslexic daughter. My hope for her is that she learns to love learning because the US education system built on standardized tests and long form reading and writing is not conducive to how her brain naturally functions. Why shouldn’t she be able to use AI to summarize and expand text to level that playing field?</p>
<p>As a parent, this is tough to navigate. There’s a line, a tipping point, between tailored learning (using ChatGPT to help with an essay) and not learning anything at all (having ChatGPT write the essay). Does learning require a certain amount of struggle? What’s the long term impact of copy-pasting non-deterministic generated text?</p>
<p>Maybe we need a new fairy <a href="https://daverupert.com/2015/02/john-henry/">tale</a> about a kid who lets a witch’s robot do all their chores and then the kid gets eaten up by the witch.</p>
<hr />
<p>About AI making you more productive…  here’s my grand conclusion after years of productivity chasing: Productivity is for you, not them.</p>
<p>If applying productivity hacks to your job benefits you, then do it. If you are more productive and don’t see monetary or “timeback” rewards or (more insidiously) you need to be more productive to keep your current job… we need to pause and take a macro perspective.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.epi.org/productivity-pay-gap/">According to the Economic Policy Institute</a>, productivity has gone up 64.7% over the last 40 years, yet wages have only gone up 14.8%. Over the same-ish timespan, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2020/01/09/trends-in-income-and-wealth-inequality/">according to Pew Research</a>…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From 1970 to 2018, the share of aggregate income going to middle-class households fell from 62% to 43%. Over the same period, the share held by upper-income households increased from 29% to 48%.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Weird, huh? Money magically rolls uphill. Consider not contributing to this gap. But if <em>you need to feel productive</em>, I want you to have it.</p>
<hr />
<p>The nuance I’m weaving is this…</p>
<p>AI as a tool to empower humans is admirable, but it doesn’t fix broken systems. If anything it exacerbates any inequalities built into existing systems. We should be careful about what we build and where we deploy any technology, lest we cause actual harm or build new high tech for-profit prisons around ourselves.</p>

## Apple intentionally kills web applications for EU users in iOS 17.4 onward to spite its EU users

date: 2024-02-15, from: OS News

With the second beta of iOS 17.4, Apple disabled much of the functionality of Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) in the European Union. There was some speculation that it could be a temporary change or a bug related to some of the updates to the app ecosystem in Europe, but Apple has confirmed that PWAs were intentionally removed and won&#8217;t be returning. ↫ Juli Clover at MacRumors When users in the European Union install iOS 17.4, all functionality regarding progressive web apps will be removed from iOS. This means that when you pin a PWA on your iOS home screen, instead of it opening &#8216;like an application&#8217;, so without any browser chrome but with additional other odds and ends to make it feel more like a native application, it&#8217;ll just open inside the full browser instead. It&#8217;s typical Apple behaviour &#8211; vindictive and petty. Their stated reasoning &#8211; it was too hard and too much work to implement this for engines other than WebKit &#8211; is a bunch of utter nonsense, since Apple had no issues with developing like 600 new APIs and a whole bunch of new complex frameworks and administrative layers just to support their malicious DMA compliance to ensure they wouldn&#8217;t lose a single cent of protection money when a developer wants to distribute an application outside of the App Store. PWAs were the only way you could get an application-like experience on your iPhone from something not controlled, owned, and monetised by Apple, so it had to go to force developers to choose either of Apple&#8217;s new, maliciously DMA compliant monetised distribution options in the EU. Every time this company does anything, it&#8217;s just&#8230; Slimy, scummy, sleazy, and anti-user.

## WoWMIPS: MIPS emulator for Windows

date: 2024-02-15, from: OS News

Recently, I began a new project &#8211; developing a MIPS emulator for Windows. Although Windows NT is commonly associated with x86-based architectures (and more recently ARM64), historically some lesser-known editions were released for other chipsets. MIPS, a RISC architecture, briefly featured on Windows NT 3.51/4.0 alongside the DEC Alpha and PowerPC before being discontinued with the release of Windows 2000.  Having been predominantly x86-focused until now, I have no prior experience with MIPS &#8211; or RISC architectures in general. As with the Win16 emulator, my plan is not to achieve 100% compatibility with complex software. Instead, I aim to emulate enough core functionality to successfully run some of the built-in Windows games and utilities. I would like to achieve this in the most universal way possible, relying on minimal hardcoded &#8220;fixes&#8221; and hooks. ↫ x86matthew A very impressive project, and a fun one, to boot. Do note that the series of articles is split up, and you can move to the next one in the series at the bottom of each article.

## Mac App Launches Slowed by Malware Scan

## European Court of Human Rights bans weakening of secure end-to-end encryption

date: 2024-02-15, from: OS News

The European Court of Human Rights yesterday banned a general weakening of secure end-to-end encryption. The judgement argues that encryption helps citizens and companies to protect themselves against hacking, theft of identity and personal data, fraud and the unauthorised disclosure of confidential information. Backdoors could also be exploited by criminal networks and would seriously jeopardise the security of all users&#8217; electronic communications. There are other solutions for monitoring encrypted communications without generally weakening the protection of all users, the Court held. The judgement cites using vulnerabilities in the target’s software or sending an implant to targeted devices as examples. ↫ EU Reporter Excellent ruling, and it throws up another roadblock to weakening end-to-end encryption in the EU, after the European Parliament also took a stance against such weakening.

## Reverse engineering a forgotten 1970s Intel dual core beast: 8271, a new ISA

date: 2024-02-15, from: OS News

Around 1977, Intel released a floppy disc controller (FDC) chip called the 8271. This controller isn&#8217;t particularly well known. It was mainly used in business computers and storage solutions, but its one breakthrough into the consumer space was with the BBC Micro, a UK-centric computer released in 1981. There are very few easily discovered details about this chip online, aside from the useful datasheet. This, combined with increasing observations of strange behavior, make the chip a bit of an enigma. My interest in the chip was piqued when I accidentally triggered a wild test mode that managed to corrupt one of my floppy discs even though the write protect tab was present! You can read about that here. Can we reverse engineer a detailed understanding of how it works? What wonders will we find? ↫ Chris Evans This thing is wild.

## Closing in on a COSMIC alpha

date: 2024-02-15, from: OS News

We’re on approach towards an alpha version of the new COSMIC desktop environment for Pop!_OS and other distros. Meanwhile, COSMIC testing has expanded to more users around the office. This month, we’re providing updates to the checklist we published in January on remaining tasks for releasing the alpha. ↫ System76&#8217;s official blog COSMIC is feeling very close now, and this update has a ton of new things and improvements in it, and COSMIC being new, it&#8217;s a lot of stuff that&#8217;s table stakes. There&#8217;s a screenshot utility now, you can tab various windows together, kind of like Haiku can, the design for the on-screen display notifications has been finalised, there&#8217;s new animations, and so much more. I&#8217;m very excited to try this out.

## Skiing is falling

date: 2024-02-15, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I went skiing again today, second time in two weeks. Feeling pretty good. And I learned something I'd like to share. A different way of looking at skiing. Here's the story...</p>
<p>First thing in the morning the snow was hard and while they had done a good job of grooming, you do a lot of sliding when you edge when the snow is so hard. Much more than in the powder you get in the Rockies. So I'm always totally thinking about staying in control and it's stressful. In this mode I ask myself why I'm doing this if it's so unpleasant. </p>
<p>But as the snow softened during the day, and my body warmed up, and my brain remembered more about this strange thing that I used to do so well, I started going faster, not worrying as much, and then started going faster, and I started feeling like wow I'm doing this well, and then boom, for an instant I completely lost control and was tilted one way, but had to land the other way, and without any conscious thought and absolutely no time to worry, my brain and body did exactly what you have to do to make this look and feel super elegant, almost as if I must have planned it this way. </p>
<p>I kept skiing a bit after that and then stopped and breathed the cold air, and looked at another ski area far in the distance (Hunter?) and realized something -- skiing is falling. You go to a mountain top, pull down your goggles, get to the top of some steepness, and you jump. The question is -- do you look and feel beautiful while doing it, or are you scared and trying to stay in control. But that's the thing, falling is all about letting it go and trusting your mind and body will know what to do when you fall one way, and also when you fall another. </p>

## Peak Campervanning

date: 2024-02-15, from: Status-Q blog

At the end of November, I popped up to the Derbyshire Peak District for a weekend, and posted some photos here. At the time, I mentioned that I had taken some video footage too, and I finally got around to editing it into something watchable, at least by those who enjoy amateur travelogues. 🙂 (Direct <a class="more-link excerpt-link" href="https://statusq.org/archives/2024/02/15/11963/">Continue Reading<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right"></span></a>

## Beyond the pale?

date: 2024-02-15, from: Status-Q blog

Today, online, I saw one unsavoury character described as &#8220;so bad that even Meta blocked him&#8221;. In the past, one might have said something similar of Twitter, but it doesn&#8217;t really work now&#8230; and not because Twitter has started being responsible about blocking people!

## The text file that runs the internet

date: 2024-02-15, from: OS News

The robots.txt file governs a give and take; AI feels to many like all take and no give. But there’s now so much money in AI, and the technological state of the art is changing so fast that many site owners can’t keep up. And the fundamental agreement behind robots.txt, and the web as a whole — which for so long amounted to “everybody just be cool” — may not be able to keep up either. ↫ David Pierce for The Verge Another thing &#8220;AI&#8221; does not respect.

## The Lammey Effect

date: 2024-02-15, from: Crossref Blog

<p>We’re equally sad and proud to report that <a href="https://www.crossref.org/authors/rachael-lammey">Rachael Lammey</a> is moving on in her career to the very lucky team at 67Bricks. Her last day at Crossref is today, Friday 16th February. Which is too soon for us, but very exciting for her!</p>
<p>It’s hard to overstate Rachael&rsquo;s impact on Crossref’s growth and success in her 12 years here. She started as a Product Manager where she developed that role into a broad and central function, and soon moved into the newly-formed community team as International Outreach Manager where she grew important programs such as Sponsors, Ambassadors, a series of ‘LIVE’ events around the world, and she went on to manage her own team and establish some of the most important strategic relationships that Crossref now feels fortunate to have.</p>

</span>
</div>
Rachael was a significant part of the growth and adoption of new initiatives such as Crossmark, Similarity Check, the REST API, preprints, grants, data citation, and ROR. She's contributed to numerous organisations such as EASE, ALPSP, SSP, ISMTE, STM, and most recently co-Chaired the NISO working group on retractions and corrections.
<p>As Head of Strategic Initiatives, and most recently, Director of Product, Rachael has shown dedication and leadership, supporting and strengthening not just her own teams but all of us across the organisation, encouraging us to do better while being one of the easiest people to work with.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect" target="_blank">butterfly effect</a>&rsquo; is the notion that the world is deeply interconnected and that one small occurrence can influence a much larger complex system. Rachael embodies that notion, having created positive ripples and waves&mdash;and certainly many connections&mdash;in the scholarly record, in our organisation, and across the community.</p>

<p>Rachael, I was saddened when I first heard the news that you were moving on to another opportunity. Your professionalism, work ethic, and positive attitude have been inspirational to work around. I have enjoyed the opportunities we have had to collaborate. As you move on to a new experience I wish you success and happiness in your future endeavors. Your presence will be missed at Crossref!

I wish you all the best and many wins in your new role.</p>

</div>
<p>One of my first ‘Crossref LIVE’ events was with Rachael in Brazil in 2016. At the time, my role mostly focused on membership, and we had just started working more closely with ABEC, a large organisation in Brazil that sponsored quite a few members. Rachael managed the sponsor program then and thought this would be a good opportunity to collaborate with a sponsor on an event, and she asked me to join her. There is so much planning for these - venues, local partners, presentations, meetings - and she had all the details in order and made the event such a success. Rachael was supportive, encouraging, and I learned so much from working with her. The Brazil trip was such a positive experience that I realised I wanted to focus more closely on community engagement. Rachael encouraged me to do so.</p>

</span>
</div>
<p>She and I went on to partner on more LIVE events together. Our time in Indonesia was perhaps one of the most memorable for me - as well as our LIVE event, we had an unexpected tour of Yogyakarta with our Indonesian hosts, involving a tour of Prambanan Temple (see photo below), batik fabric shopping, visiting a few universities, and a stop at our hosts’ home. All the while trying not to let the winding car ride and traffic get the better of us. Our event the next day went perfectly, and I told her, half-jokingly, that the whole experience renewed my faith in humanity. Of note, we also drank the only bottle of wine available in the hotel bar.</p>
<p>Rachael was also my Crossref running buddy, and we spent quite a few miles together - in Brazil, NH, Maine, Oxford, and Spain. During our runs, topics ranged from Game of Thrones to Idris Elba to sportsing, but not so much about work. The next time I find myself in England, we will run a few more miles together, followed by a pint. Thank you for everything!</p>

<p>Many have pointed out how talented, wise, or skilled you are and I certainly will not contradict a single word of it but that&rsquo;s not what comes to mind first for me.

I have dreaded some meetings from time to time.

Thanks for those heartening chats when I needed a boost, and for including me in webinars and recordings - it really helped me improve. Remember that funny mistake I made on a recording when I called us "Rochael"? We sure had a good laugh! I'm gonna miss those times and working with you.

Your sportsing is also very impressive. All the best.

<p><p>Not all heroes wear capes! Rachael defines that saying so much with her ethic of getting things DONE! I know she loves to get things done but the speed and quality in which that happens is second-to-none. Rachael will be massively missed at Crossref and 67Bricks don’t yet know what they have found. I enjoyed working with Rachael throughout my tenure at Crossref, she has helped me a huge amount in developing my programming skills and has always been encouraging throughout, especially with the &rsquo;toil-bashing’ which is substantial and overwhelming at times.</p>
<p>On a more personal note, she is a great drinking buddy and always motivates me to be more active… by making me feel lazy. The number of hours Rachael would work was crazy, but then I always thought that anyone who gets up that early to go for runs must be a little crazy!

When I started at Crossref in March 2015—at the UKSG conference in Glasgow—Rachael was leading a workshop on text mining, showing off in full glory her ‘unicorn’ mix of skills from her technical knowledge of metadata and APIs to her facilitation techniques with a large group of people, clearly a community whose needs she knew inside out. Later that evening, Rachael took it upon herself to induct me in the ways of Crossref. One of the most important things she thought I should know was that we were all trusted and treated like adults - there was no micromanagement and I was to feel completely free to challenge the status quo.

After one of the first ‘LIVE’ events, in Vilnius, I realised that it was Rachael who had created and embodied that trusted vibe through her own approach. She has been entrusted with so many programs, projects, teams, and tricky situations. Almost every launch, release, announcement, or achievement at Crossref very likely had Rachael’s eye on it at some stage, certainly the ‘actually-getting-it-done’ stage. Our close working relationship over the last nine years grew into a great friendship and I’m not quite sure how I’ll feel when the reality sets in and she’s not here for a quick chat, always a reality check. Working with Rachael has been inspiring, exciting, reassuring, and hilarious (that dry 'Norn Iron' humour!). 67Bricks is so fortunate and I can’t wait to watch her help them go from strength to strength, just like she has done for Crossref. See you soon, Ranty Rachael, no doubt putting the world to rights over a bottle of Malbec and many eyerolls 🙄.

My third week at Crossref back in 2017 was at the annual meeting in Singapore, and not getting into the timezone and not sleeping for 4 days was eased by our visit to a rooftop nightclub on the penultimate night - just before you headed off to Indonesia for a series of meetings with members and sponsors. I still don’t know where you get all your energy!

I will miss your honesty and energy, and the opportunity to challenge you again on the amount of food consumed in one sitting… I don’t think you’ll need luck in your next place, but I wish you that it is all you want it to be.</p>

Thank you for your collaboration and friendship over the past decade! You will be missed. We've worked on a long series of abbreviations, acronyms, and portmanteaus!

<p>Rachael! One thing I admire most in a person is a facility with metaphor accompanied by the ability to see to the heart of a matter, and hoo boy do you have those qualities in spades. I remember so clearly your talk at the Crossref team meeting in Spain in 2023 in which you clarified the Big Picture for us all in an extremely enlightening way, and then, in a smaller but equally impressive achievement, casually mentioning in a Funder Registry meeting that funders should start &ldquo;stretching and warming up&rdquo; for the transition to ROR – boy did I latch on to that terrific image. I wish you all the best at 67 Bricks.</p>

On one of our first meet ups together, I drove us from the Lynnfield office to Logan airport in rush hour, and we managed to survive the Bostonian road rage in one piece. We spent the ride talking through the intricacies of a sponsoring organization’s agreement. Rachael has been a safe set of hands and an encyclopedia of institutional memory for Crossref for 12 years.
<p>Rachael is one of those people who’s as equally competent as she is a pleasure to work with. She’s an innate leader because people want to get behind her.

## Programming the SunFounder GalaxyRVR Mars Rover

Introduction Last time, we gave our initial review of the SunFounder GalaxyRVR Mars Rover, this time we’ll look at how to program it. Unlike SunFounder’s PiCar or PiDog which are powered by Raspberry Pis, the GalaxyRVR has an Arduino Uno as its brain. This means writing the program in Arduino C rather than Python. It [&#8230;]

I'm getting good at it. Yesterday I did that with the <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/02/13.html#a214721">piece</a> about President Biden and how he probably would rather be doing anything than be President, for a mostly thankless country, at age 81. I imagine he has great-grandchildren he'd like to get to know. Maybe a book or two to read, maybe one to write. To get his affairs in order. At age 68 I'm trying to shed responsibility as much as possible. It's prudent, and has a point. When I was 25 I wanted to take over the world. Now I'd just like to feel good. As you get older you are capable of more depth of feeling, in some ways, and grow more numb in others. I spent time with my father at 80, his last year. He was always a curious man, wanting to learn about anything new, but in his last days he wasn't curious. No ambition. But he seemed okay with it, even happy at times (possibly due in part to the morphine he was allowed). Anyway, it's always interesting to see where people react to what among the different social web networks. And in this case, the most flow came from <a href="https://mastodon.social/@davew/111926409460785756">Mastodon</a>, by far. I would not have predicted that. And it's good to see, that interesting ideas and perspective may have more of a future outside the networks operated by the billionaire tech companies.

## Ai and Robots

<p>David Pierce at The Verge just published a great long-form piece about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24067997/robots-txt-ai-text-file-web-crawlers-spiders">robots.txt</a>, the relationship between the people running websites and the people running spiders and crawlers, and what’s happening now that AI has entered the scene.</p>
<p>It’s a great piece and the timing is convenient for me personally because just the other day I emailed the lovely people at The Browser Company asking how can I opt out of their stupid <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/a-rant-on-arc-search">ARC Search</a>. They care about users and user experience and so do I so I’m sure they must have a way for me to block their new AI. I’m still waiting to get a reply…</p>

## 2024-02-09 Oddµ namespaces and live updating

date: 2024-02-14, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1>2024-02-09 Oddµ namespaces and live updating</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a slow morning. I had my two cups of coffee, ate my pancakes with plum jam, spent time online reading Mastodon, talked to my wife about wannabe-axe murderers on Swiss trains, looked up stuff about <a href="https://www.tax-the-rich.eu/">taxing the rich</a>…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been working on Oddmu again. My goal is to be able to reproduce the <a href="https://campaignwiki.org/">Campaign Wiki</a> setup:</p>

<ul>
<li>people can get a &ldquo;space&rdquo; for their site by signing up in some way</li>
<li>they can make changes to the look and feel of their site (change the headers, footers, colours, i.e. make changes to both the HTML template and the CSS)</li>
<li>feeds, list of changes and all that are limited to their site</li>
</ul>

<p>Using Oddmu would also result in the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>sites are no longer publically editable (which isn&rsquo;t a requirement for such spaces like role-playing game campaigns)</li>
</ul>

<p>Oddmu now has the following features:</p>

<ul>
<li>when editing pages in a subdirectory, the <code>index</code> and <code>changes</code> page in the same directory are updated (instead of the root directory)</li>
<li>when HTML templates exist in the same directory, those are used instead of the templates in the root directory (e.g. <a href="oddmu/index">Oddµ</a>)</li>
<li>when uploading a HTML template, it is loaded immediately (no more server restart)</li>
</ul>

<p>Once I had this implemented using a library that watches the filesystem for changes, I realized that I could use the same feature to index new pages. This brings me closer to having online and offline writing feature equivalence: Using the web site to create a page should be equivalent to writing a page elsewhere and uploading it to the site via rsync.
(Offline you can use the <code>oddmu notify</code> command to add links to <code>index</code>, <code>changes</code> and hashtag pages.)</p>

<p>I think I&rsquo;m getting close!</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Oddµ">#Oddµ</a></p>

<p>Also, code complexity is through the roof, now. All the global maps aren&rsquo;t thread-safe so they need mutexes. There&rsquo;s a weird Heisenbug I have where I run the test suite and then <code>view.html</code> is gone. The next test run then fails, of course. Thinking it was related to the order of tests, I started running <code>go test -shuffle on</code> and found a plethora of <em>other</em> bugs. And I&rsquo;ve seen at least two occasions where I noticed the disappearing <code>view.html</code> bug, noted the shuffle id, reran the test with that id, got the error again, tried for a third time, and then tests passed. So… it must be a race condition of some sort.</p>

<p>How aggravating.</p>

<p>Maybe something got lost, with that last set of changes.</p>

<p>I do feel, however, that I&rsquo;ve found a lot of bugs… Just now, for example, to help prevent Oddmu from showing any directories or files with a path segment starting with a period…</p>

<p><strong>2024-02-14</strong>. I need to think about an archive handler that allows you to get a zip file for the current directory. (I guess zip files are more accessible than .tar.gz files? Like, for Windows and macOS…</p>

<p>And the archive needs to take <a href="2024-02-14-oddmu-bug">ODDMU_FILTER</a> into account!</p>

<p>Done. ✔️</p>

## 2024-02-14 Oddµ bug maybe

date: 2024-02-14, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1>2024-02-14 Oddµ bug maybe</h1>

<p>I had a site where an entire subdirectory was private. Nobody but the author could read or write those pages. I had configured Apache to require authentication for this subdirectory.</p>

<p>The config looked a bit like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;LocationMatch &quot;^/(edit|save|add|append|upload|drop|view/secret)/&quot;&gt;
  AuthType Basic
  AuthName &quot;Password Required&quot;
  AuthUserFile /home/oddmu/.htpasswd
  Require valid-user
&lt;/LocationMatch&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Note the addition of <code>view/secret</code>.</p>

<p>But yesterday I realized that you can run a search in the root. Such a search includes all the pages in subdirectories, and so Oddmu served an extract of the pages in the &ldquo;secret&rdquo; subdirectory. Adding <code>|search/secret</code> to the <code>LocationMatch</code> doesn&rsquo;t help.</p>

<p>I had to decide whether to disable search all together, or disable the search of subdirectories, or add a new feature.</p>

<p>I added a new feature.</p>

<p>It is tied to an environment variable called <code>ODDMU_FILTER</code>. It matches the directory being searched and the directory where the search starts. If the directory doesn&rsquo;t match, the pages returned must also not match; if the directory does match, the pages returned must also match.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an example of three pages:</p>

<ul>
<li>/a</li>
<li>/public/b</li>
<li>/secret/c</li>
</ul>

<p>The environment variable is set: <code>ODDMU_FILTER=^secret/</code> – what happens now?</p>

<ul>
<li>If you search from the root (doesn&rsquo;t match the filter), then only pages a and b are searched (they also don&rsquo;t match the filter).</li>
<li>If you search from /public (doesn&rsquo;t match the filter), then only page b is searched  (also doesn&rsquo;t match the filter). This behaviour is unchanged from before. Searches start with the directory the user is looking at.</li>
<li>If you search from /secret (matches the filter), then only page c is searched (also matches the filter). This, too, is unchanged from before.</li>
</ul>

<p>Naturally, you still need to change to the web server config for the actual authentication to happen:</p>

## Mozilla downsizes as it refocuses on Firefox and AI

date: 2024-02-13, from: OS News

Specifically, Mozilla plans to scale back its investment in a number of products, including its VPN, Relay and, somewhat remarkably, its Online Footprint Scrubber, which launched only a week ago. Mozilla will also shut down Hubs, the 3D virtual world it launched back in 2018, and scale back its investment in its mozilla.social Mastodon instance. The layoffs will affect roughly 60 employees. Bloomberg previously reported the layoffs. Going forward, the company said in an internal memo, Mozilla will focus on bringing “trustworthy AI into Firefox.” To do so, it will bring together the teams that work on Pocket, Content and AI/Ml. ↫ Frederic Lardinois for TechCrunch I&#8217;d like to remind everyone that I&#8217;ve been warning the Linux world about the precarious, uncertain future of Firefox for years now. The single most important desktop Linux application is in a death spiral and entirely dependent on free Google money. Not a good base to work from. With today&#8217;s news, I only feel strengthened in my conviction that the major desktop projects in the Linux world need to come together in a serious manner to discuss the establishment of a browser project optimised for Linux. Pick an engine, let the GNOME and KDE developers build a native UI on top, and take matters into your own hands. If you can build the two best desktop environments in desktop computing today, you can build a first-class browser together. This is existential.

## Microsoft is bringing Copilot “AI” to Notepad for Windows 11

date: 2024-02-13, from: OS News

Microsoft plans to make Copilot AI inseparable from Windows. After releasing Copilot for Windows 11 and 10 and adding it to Microsoft apps, you can now use Copilot AI in Notepad to get simplified explanations. You can install the Notepad app update via the Microsoft Store to use this feature, but remember, it only works in Dev or Canary channels. Notepad version 11.2401.25.0 adds the “Explain with Copilot” option in its context menu. After highlighting a chunk of text (sentences, code snippets, etc), right-click and select the “Explain with Copilot” option. Or you can press the Ctrl + E shortcut to invoke this feature. ↫ Abhishek Mishra I wonder if you could replace this new, butchered Notepad with a an older, working copy.

## FreeBSD 15, 16 to end support for 32 bit platforms

date: 2024-02-13, from: OS News

FreeBSD is deprecating 32-bit platforms over the next couple of major releases. We anticipate FreeBSD 15.0 will not include the armv6, i386, and powerpc platforms, and FreeBSD 16.0 will not include armv7. Support for executing 32-bit binaries on 64-bit kernels will be retained through at least the lifetime of the stable/16 branch if not longer. (There is currently no plan to remove support for 32-bit binaries on 64-bit kernels.) ↫ John Baldwin on freebsd-announce I don&#8217;t think this is too egregious of a timeline, but there&#8217;s always someone with some weird edge case that gets bit hard by deprecations like these.

## Running UNIX on a Nintendo Entertainment System

date: 2024-02-13, from: OS News

Who wouldn’t want to run a UNIX-like operating system on their NES or Famicom? Although there’s arguably no practical reason for doing so, decrazyo has cobbled together a working port of Little Unix (LUnix), which was originally written for the Commodore 64 and 128 by Daniel Dallmann. The impetus for this project was initially curiosity, but when decrazyo saw that someone had already written a UNIX-like OS for the 6502 processor, it seemed apparent that the NES was too similar to the C64 to not port it. ↫ Maya Posch for Hackaday This is peak computing.

But, as Keith Olbermann spells out so well in his latest <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/garland-must-stop-hurs-plans-to-testify-to-house-gop-2-13-24/id1633301179?i=1000645128033">Countdown</a>, if he were to step aside that would basically concede the election to Trump. So if you think the old man is being silly and vain, well, he's being a lot smarter than you are, and btw, paying a huge price. If you live to be 81, I bet the last thing you want to do, after the life he's had, is to be in this position. We should get behind him, and tell him so, let him know we don't want anyone else, and we want him to be happy, healthy and know that the smart, good people of the US appreciate what he's doing for all of us.

## How to get the retro WordArt back in Microsoft Word

date: 2024-02-13, from: OS News

Graphic design is my passion so naturally I love the vintage, 1990s WordArt. This was a feature in Microsoft Word that allowed you to create timeless “3D” renderings of any text you wanted. It was perfection, but for some reason Microsoft overhauled the feature in the late 2000s, basically ruining it.  These are a soulless simulacrum of the WordArt of yore. The true WordArt remains, however, embedded deep in the code of Microsoft Word itself. But some things that should not have been forgotten were lost. History became legend. Legend became myth. And for twenty years WordArt passed out of all knowledge.&#160; But it can be found again. ↫ Justin Pot at Popular Science I had no idea this stuff was still in there, but I guess it makes sense &#8211; people absolutely adored this stuff, and it was all over the place for a very long time. You would see it in restaurants, hotels, schools, stores, everywhere &#8211; from high-end, luxury places to bargain basements. Now that I think about it, I&#8217;m not at all surprised it&#8217;s still accessible.

Today I still write 6502 assembly, plus some Power ISA and even a little TMS9900. I like assembly languages and how in control of the CPU you feel writing in one. But you know what would make me not like an assembly language? One that was contrived and not actually the CPU it was running on. And you know what would make me like it even less? If it were kneecapped, convoluted and limited without even proper I/O facilities. ↫ Old Vintage Computing Research Everything you ever wanted to know about CAP-X and COMP-X. Which turns out to be a lot.

## Firehouse Five and the Cinderella Surprise

date: 2024-02-13, from: Cobel Sasser's blog

My goal was to preserve some never-before-heard recordings of an incredible Dixieland jazz band made up of mostly Disney employees, the Firehouse Five Plus Two. But along the way, I accidentally discovered an incredible lost song that was cut from Walt Disney&#8217;s Cinderella. And you&#8217;re about to hear it too. Let&#8217;s go.

## “People don’t quit bad jobs, they quit bad bosses”: How journalists evaluate newsroom leadership

In the first weeks of my first job in journalism, the editor-in-chief stormed into the newsroom, furious — the photo editor had not photographed the event that he had planned the front page around. He stood before her, red-faced and yelling, before grabbing a copy of the AP Stylebook off a nearby table and throwing...

## How an ethic of care can heal the harms of journalism

This newsletter is almost four years old, and during that time we have chronicled again and again how research has shown how deeply frustrated many consumers are with news as it exists today.

## How NASA Uses Simple Technology to Track Lunar Missions

date: 2024-02-13, from: NASA breaking news

NASA is using a simple but effective technology called Laser Retroreflective Arrays (LRAs) to determine the locations of lunar landers more accurately. They will be attached to most of the landers from United States companies as part of NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Service (CLPS) initiative. LRAs are inexpensive, small, and lightweight, allowing future lunar orbiters [&#8230;]

This is what I imagine we all yearn for, for someone to really know us before we die. Okay if it can't be other people, at least let it be a machine. Something like preserving a brain. Wouldn't it be great to know that when you're gone, the essential you, even if it doesn't include your consciousness, persists? You could visit a person like you visit a website. This is just evolutionary, and it's obviously going to happen.

## On climbing and design

date: 2024-02-13, from: Manu - I write blog

<p>I don’t climb, I am not a climber, I don’t have interest in becoming one. I do happen to have a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ivanmoreale/">brother</a> though. And he’s a climber. And if you know anything about climbers is that they’re a bit obsessed with the sport. And as a result of that I’m becoming a climber by proximity. I have absolutely no intention of practicing the sport but I do enjoy watching it as a sport and I also enjoy consuming content related to it. Mainly because climbers climb in gorgeous places and I love nature. Anyway my brother also happens to be a graphic designer and it was only a matter of time before the two things collided. Well, it finally happened: <a href="https://621.design">621.design</a></p>
<figure class="m-o" data-template="with"><div class="m-m"><img class="img" loading="lazy" src="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/on-climbing-and-design/c7954b39fd-1707814510/621.jpg" style="aspect-ratio:1000 / 1333"></div></figure>
<p>The first series of climbing inspired t-shirts are available to be purchased after WAY TOO LONG! I’m already tired of hearing about this project but I’m happy that they’re finally out in the wild. Just to be clear, I am not involved with this. I’m just doing my part and let you know that these exist because who knows, maybe some of you out there are into climbing.</p>
<p>Now, I do have one of those T-shirts sitting on my desk this very moment. It’s the <a href="https://621.design/products/climb">Climb</a>, size L. If you want it, you can sign up to my <a href="https://ko-fi.com/manuelmoreale">One a Month</a> and then send me a message. I’m gonna send it to the first one who claims it and will throw in something else at random in the package. No drugs I promise you. I might add a book in there or maybe a stick from the woods. Still don’t know but there’s going to be something.</p>
<p>Anyway, <a href="https://621.design">621.design</a>, also on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/621.design/">Instagram </a>. Go tell my brother that these took WAY TOO LONG to come out.</p>

<p>Not really pleased with how today&rsquo;s scene is going. I feel like I had good ideas for it two weeks ago, but I didn&rsquo;t write it then, because I still hadn&rsquo;t finished the previous scenes 😖 Now I&rsquo;m scrambling a bit – &ldquo;Oh, this bit of dialogue was in it, right?&rdquo; and it just doesn&rsquo;t feel cohesive.

## Ed Pentz accepts the 2024 NISO Miles Conrad Award

date: 2024-02-13, from: Crossref Blog

<p>Great news to share: our Executive Director, Ed Pentz, has been selected as the 2024 recipient of the Miles Conrad Award from the USA&rsquo;s National Information Standards Organization (NISO). The award is testament to an individual&rsquo;s lifetime contribution to the information community, and we couldn&rsquo;t be more delighted that Ed was voted to be this year&rsquo;s well-deserved recipient.</p>
<div class="shortcode-divwrap align-right">
<span><figure><img src="https://www.crossref.org/images/staff/ed17-720px.png" width="100%"/>
</figure>
</span>
</div>
<p>During the <a href="https://niso.plus" target="_blank">NISO Plus conference</a> this week in Baltimore, USA, Ed accepted his award and delivered the 2024 Miles Conrad lecture, reflecting on how far open scholarly infrastructure has come, and the part he has played in this at Crossref and through numerous other collaborative initiatives.</p>
<p>Established in 1965, the Miles Conrad Award gives recognition to those who&rsquo;ve made substantial contributions to the information community over a lifetime. Named after the founder of the National Federation of Abstracting and Indexing Services (NFAIS)—an association that since merged with NISO—the award encourages innovation in content management and dissemination. Over the years, leaders and innovators who have significantly influenced the field of information exchange have been honored with the award. Ed has joined <a href="https://www.niso.org/awards/MCA" target="_blank">an illustrious group</a>!</p>
<p>Ed’s leadership in collaboration and diplomacy has led to Crossref&rsquo;s success in making research objects more accessible and useful to a wide global audience, including publishers, researchers, funders, societies, libraries, and more. Crossref&rsquo;s founding purpose is stated as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“To promote the development and cooperative use of new and innovative technologies to speed and facilitate scientific and other scholarly research”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Acknowledging his privilege as a Western, university-educated, white man, which he comments has helped his career, Ed prioritises collaboration, open communication, teamwork, and equity in creating a positive, trusted environment that has brought together a diverse team of 49 colleagues from 11 countries. The organisation’s culture allows everyone to grow and contribute to the mission of a connected <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/research-nexus">research nexus</a> by including and developing solutions for community members across the globe.</p>
<p>Before his journey with Crossref, Ed held a number of roles at Harcourt Brace, including launching Academic Press&rsquo;s first online journal. This experience led to his involvement with the DOI-X pilot project, which became the foundation for Crossref. Since its launch in 2000, under his leadership, Crossref has become an important component of the research ecosystem, an open scholarly infrastructure with nearly 20,000 members across more than 150 countries. Crossref is now the main source of &gt;155 million records about all kinds of research objects and this open metadata registry is relied upon by thousands of tools and services across the whole research system.</p>
<p>Ed’s influence is also evident throughout the wider world of open scholarly infrastructure; aside from establishing Crossref, he co-founded <a href="https://ror.org/" target="_blank">ROR</a> and was a founding member of <a href="https://orcid.org/" target="_blank">ORCID</a>, where he also served as board Chair. Further, he has engaged with the community by holding various advisory positions, including the <a href="https://www.doi.org/" target="_blank">DOI Foundation</a>, the Digital Object Naming Authority (DONA), and the Coalition for Diversity in Scholarly Publishing (C4DISC).</p>
<p>Ed also emphasised that the long-term success of community initiatives lies in patience and the ability to agree on high-level principles of purpose and governance, which oil the wheels of collaboration, encourage participation, and enable more progressive change that builds and lasts over time. He says, &ldquo;to solve collective problems it takes collaboration and diplomacy, bringing together a group of stakeholders, balancing their different concerns, building trust, and reaching consensus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The adoption of the <a href="https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org" target="_blank">Principles of Open Scholarly Infrastructure (POSI)</a>, along with (so far) 14 other organisations, was a key <a href="https://www.crossref.org/categories/posi/">turning point for Crossref</a>, Ed said, and one which has already paved the way for more openness of key metadata for the community, including references and retractions, as well as closer partnerships with many of the other POSI adoptees, given their shared understanding and experience.</p>
<p>Referencing the current &ldquo;peak hype&rdquo; around artificial intelligence (AI), Ed points to the challenge of research integrity and the &ldquo;growing field of science sleuthing&rdquo; as a forthcoming area that Crossref and open metadata may help tackle at scale, including through Crossref&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.crossref.org/categories/research-integrity">Integrity of the Scholarly Record (ISR) Program</a> and&mdash;of course&mdash;community-wide collaboration.</p>
<p>In concluding his talk, Ed describes his hopes and dreams for scholarly communications in the future. He would like to see more balance in diversity in the leadership of open scholarly infrastructure, extended integrations among the various foundational infrastructures, and a fully connected system where the scholarly record is inclusive globally.</p>
<h4 id="ed-on-behalf-of-all-your-proud-colleagues-at-crossref-thank-you-and-congratulations">Ed, on behalf of all your proud colleagues at Crossref, thank you and congratulations!</h4>

## Just give me some truth

date: 2024-02-12, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I just found myself writing in a <a href="https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/C3RBrhlJfgb">tweet on Threads</a> that the news industry has contempt for its readers that AI tools don't have. </p>
<p>Actually the AIs also have a way better attitude about the truth than Wikipedia does (yes I know Wikipedia is a Ouija board, that the very worst people control).</p>
<p>We weren't worried about the rise of fascism and the destruction of our ecology, but we were worried about preserving jobs for supposed truth-tellers who think we deserve garbage and don't disappoint. </p>

**@Jessica Smith's blog** (date: 2024-02-12, from: Jessica Smith's blog)

<p>A couple of weeks ago, I was chatting with one of my Idist friends, and I was venting about one of my brothers-in-law, who is insufferable. They asked me, &ldquo;In English, do you also say &lsquo;brother-in-law&rsquo; for those men who think they know everything, but in fact they just parrot what they hear, mostly antiquated, masculinist ideas? In Spain we call such men &lsquo;cuñados&rsquo;, even when they&rsquo;re not literally our brothers-in-law&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I was like, &ldquo;omg no, I&rsquo;ve never heard that in English, but that&rsquo;s brilliant. I love it!&rdquo; It is a <em>perfect</em> description of this brother-in-law, that&rsquo;s for sure. Clearly, insufferable brothers-in-law are a phenomenon that transcends borders.</p>

## Meet NASA’s Twin Spacecraft Headed to the Ends of the Earth

date: 2024-02-12, from: NASA breaking news

Launching in spring 2024, the two small satellites of the agency’s PREFIRE mission will fill in missing data from Earth’s polar regions. Two new miniature NASA satellites will start crisscrossing Earth’s atmosphere in a few months, detecting heat lost to space. Their observations from the planet’s most bone-chilling regions will help predict how our ice, [&#8230;]

## Six months in, journalist-owned tech publication 404 Media is profitable

date: 2024-02-12, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

Until January, most stories from 404 Media were available to read for free.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-02-12, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

The SuperBowl last night was an excellent sports game. I didn't like all the bullshit, but it was good sport. However it's all about gambling. I bet it's ruining a lot of lives. A way of sucking the last pennies from people who are already struggling. And it's so easy, just get an app for your phone, add your credit card, and give them all your money.

## Housekeeping

date: 2024-02-12, from: Manu - I write blog

<p>First housekeeping post of 2024. Hope you all had a great beginning of the year. As usual, a couple of things in no particular order:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://peopleandblogs.com">People and Blogs</a> is about to hit 25 interviews. There’s 52 weeks in a year so we’re almost half way through year one. I’m happy to see that people are enjoying the series. Makes me so happy.</li>
<li>Running Minimalissimo is fun. I’ve already coded a few things for the site—a <a href="https://minimalissimo.com/articles/books-and-a-new-navigation">new navigation</a>, a new <a href="https://minimalissimo.com/articles/stream">stream</a> section and also a new books page—and I have plenty of other things I want to do.</li>
<li>My <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/one-a-month">one a month experiment</a> is a tiny success. Kind people are still out there and I think it’s important to try support a more sane web in a sustainable way.</li>
<li>I’m hosting the <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/indieweb-carnival-digital-relationships">IndieWeb Carnival this month</a>. You can find the first 15 submissions at the link above and you have time until February 28th to send yours.</li>
<li>I’m redesigning my blog. It’s not a true redesign, it will feel very familiar if you visited this site over the past 5 or 6 years. Structure will stay pretty much the same but I felt the need to tweak a few things here and there. I’m also going to reintroduce a web font. I was in my 20s the last time I used one on this site. Gonna be fun.</li>
</ol>
<p>And that’s all I have for this February housekeeping. As always my inbox is open if you want to get in touch. Have a great day.</p>

If the Supreme Court had an ounce of guts they would say <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-insurrection-14th-amendment-2024-colorado-d16dd8f354eeaf450558378c65fd79a2">this isn't</a> a state matter, it's a federal matter, and we are the federal government, so here's the deal. Trump tried to overthrow the government and he took an oath to protect the government, and therefore the 14th Amendment applies, and he can't be on the ballot anywhere, including Colorado.

## One way is always better than two

date: 2024-02-11, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Most Hacker News threads devolve into people talking about personalities, not about tech stuff. But yesterday's <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39324847">thread</a> about OPML was the rare exception, until someone who says they like me (I guess) said something personal and ugly. </p>
<p>I wonder why after all this time we can't see how pointless it is to have opinions about people, esp online. Everything you hear is passed through someone else's filters, so you're getting a huge dose of their personality along with a sliver of insight into the person they're talking about. </p>
<p>And don't forget to factor in that sometimes when someone has put an <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+interop">obstacle</a> in the way of big companies, you can earn favor inside those companies by scandalizing the person whose work they object to. There was a lot of that happening as RSS crossed paths with some very big and rich companies with lots of employees, and an interest in appearing to interop without the cost of interop.</p>
<p>I've tried to add formats, protocols and software to the mix, always trying to compromise. It's not mentioned in the Wikipedia page on RSS that I had a format that does what RSS does, a year before it existed, but I gave it up so that Netscape and UserLand would build on the same format, RSS. </p>
<p>I didn't invent RSS. I did something much greater, I compromised. We had the leading blogging software at the time, and Netscape had the feeds of four credible news orgs. When you put them together, that turned out to be huge power. We eventually pulled in all of social media and all of professional publishing into one format. Ask anyone who was active at the time. The blogging world adopted RSS in an instant, in 1999 and 2000. And in 2002, when the NYT adopted it, again, in an instant the entire news world all of a sudden all had RSS feeds. You can see it in the steady stream of announcements in the archive of <a href="http://scripting.com/">this blog</a>. </p>
<p>BTW there was someone brilliant at Netscape who saw our compromise and responded with more compromise. Their next version of RSS had some of the features we had left behind in our format. We never asked them to do that, they just figured it out. Collaboration is something that requires two, one person can't collaborate on their own. I know that sounds ridiculous, but sometimes people don't look for the other party who made compromise possible.</p>
<p>I don't think even the people who were closest to it at the time understood the move. And I don't think very many appreciate the power that comes from being the one who throws in the towel on their pet project to attain unity. </p>
<p>One way of doing something is always better than two. That's just a restatement of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle#:~:text=It%20is%20often%20reworded%20as,an%20early%20specification%20of%20TCP.">Postel's Postulate</a>. Be conservative in what you send. </p>
<p>That doesn't just apply to you, it applies to all of us collectively. Every time you add something that already exists we're all going to pay for it. </p>
<p>If you think that saying this makes me <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cantankerous">cantankerous</a> -- well, I say okay -- but you're wrong because it's generous and brilliant to push back when people add complexity. Of course people don't like to hear they're doing something wrong, but when it comes to accumulating complexity debt unnecessarily, well imho you have to listen to that. Complexity is a force against interop. </p>
<p>We should be looking for opportunities to work together to create something greater than anything any one of us can create. </p>

## Short history of all Windows UI frameworks and libraries

date: 2024-02-11, from: OS News

The official way to create user interfaces for the Windows operating system changed quite a lot of times during the last years. Microsoft created and (partially or fully) abadoned a lot of APIs which where intended to replace the respective previous ones. They changed names and ways how it&#8217;s supposed to be done a few times, and left a lof of developers confused. Here is a small historical overview. ↫ Nikolaus Gebhardt If you&#8217;re ever wondering how we ended up at a situation where, on the desktop and in Explorer, context menus have their own context menus, well, this is why.

## The state of X.org and Wayland in one paragraph

date: 2024-02-11, from: OS News

Wayland and X.org are both part of freedesktop. Whatever maintenance is still happening on X.org is mostly being done by people who primarily work on Wayland. There isn&#8217;t some kind of holy war going on between The Wayland Developers who want to kill X.org, and The X.org Developers who believe it is great and want to keep it. They&#8217;re nearly all the same people, and they all want X.org to die. AFAIK there isn&#8217;t anybody who is actually clamoring to *do the work of maintaining X.org upstream*. There are people who don&#8217;t want it to die because Wayland doesn&#8217;t yet have the features they need or the NVIDIA proprietary driver doesn&#8217;t work well on Wayland or whatever, but AFAIK, none of those people is actually volunteering to maintain X.org long-term. ↫ Adam Williamson There&#8217;s really no clearer summary of the current state of affairs than this.

## Introducing Fedora Atomic Desktops

date: 2024-02-11, from: OS News

We are happy to announce the creation of a new family of Fedora Linux spins: Fedora Atomic Desktops! As Silverblue has grown in popularity, we’ve seen more of our mainline Fedora Linux spins make the jump to offer a version that implements rpm-ostree. It’s reached the point where it can be hard to talk about all of them at the same time. Therefore we’ve introduced a new brand that will serve to simplify how we discuss rpm-ostree and how we name future atomic spins. ↫ Joseph Gayoso for Fedora Magazine You can get pretty much any major desktop environment as an rpm-ostree (inaccurately referred to as &#8216;immutable&#8217;) version of Fedora, so it makes sense to standardise the naming scheme.

## Accidentally making windows vanish in my old-fashioned Unix X environment

date: 2024-02-11, from: OS News

One of the somewhat odd things about my old fashioned X Window System environment is that when I &#8216;iconify&#8217; or &#8216;minimize&#8217; a window, it (mostly) winds up as an actual icon on my root window (what in some environments would be called the desktop), in contrast to the alternate approach where the minimized window is represented in some sort of taskbar. I have strong opinions about where some of these icons should go, and some tools to automatically arrange this for various windows, including the GNU Emacs windows I (now) use for reading email. ↫ Chris Siebenmann Iconification should be possible in any modern desktop environment, and it&#8217;s sad that this paradigm has pretty much entirely vanished. I would love for iconified windows to be treated essentially the same way as files, so you can move them around, drop them inside directories, and even move them from one computer to another (assuming they have the application in question installed). If I&#8217;m working on a project, and I have a bunch of LibreOffice documents, spreadsheets, browser tabs, notes in a text editor, some images open, and so on, I should be able to iconify them all, keep them in the project&#8217;s directory, and de-iconify them as if nothing had ever happened. Right now, you have to use files and application states for that, which is cumbersome and annoying. Sadly, advanced window management is dying. Shame.

**@Jessica Smith's blog** (date: 2024-02-11, from: Jessica Smith's blog)

<p>So, recently I’ve been rereading old journal entries, which is <em>always</em> playing with fire a bit, but this time I decided to try this new thing where I ONLY read the fuckin’ hilarious entries (and the sexy ones, after a certain point) and none of the traumatic ones and oh my god, this way is so much better. There’s so much shit I completely forgot about. Why is it always the bad memories that stick in your mind, and never the good ones! Feeling a bit of nostalgic sorrow now, but still, this has been good fun.</p>

## Review of Chip War by Chris Miller

date: 2024-02-11, from: Stephen Smith's blog

Introduction Last time, Jeff Hortobagyi presented his review of Chip War: The Fight For The World’s Most Critical Technology, Simon and Schuster, 2022 by Chris Miller. I agree with Jeff’s review, but thought I’d add a few observations from my personal experience. I first learned to program in 1976 in grade 10 using a 300 [&#8230;]
