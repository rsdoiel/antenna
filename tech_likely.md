## Bearblog is fun

date: 2024-05-29, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>If you’re into blogging and the blogging world, chances are you might have heard about <a href="https://bearblog.dev">bearblog.dev</a>. And if you’re a reader of this blog you might have also <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/pb-herman-martinus">read the interview with Herman</a>, Bearblog’s creator.</p>
<p>I never used Bearblog, mainly because I’m happy with my setup and I have no reason to look for another blog solution.</p>
<p>That said, a few weeks back I started toying with the idea of porting the design of this site over to Bear, just for fun. And to my surprise, creating a bear version of my site was surprisingly simple.</p>
<p>Which is why <a download href="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/bearblog-is-fun/8994e049c2-1717000249/bearblog_manu_theme.zip">I&rsquo;m happy to release a V0.1 of this experiment</a>. The demo site I’m using it’s currently up at <a href="https://css.bearblog.dev">css.bearblog.dev</a>. This is a very quick and dirty version. There's some leftover code in there but it should mostly work.</p>
<hr />
<p>Quick note: I might use that test site in the future to code other themes so depending on when you’re reading this post, the live preview might not actually show the correct theme.</p>
<hr />
<p>To install it just head over to the “Themes” section in your dashboard, delete everything inside the “Edit theme CSS” section and paste in the code of my theme. Hit “Publish” and you’re done.</p>
<p>I’m sure there will be bugs because there are always bugs. If you need help with anything <a href="mailto:hello@manuelmoreale.com">send me an email</a>. The theme is free, if you want to contribute the best way to do it is to <a href="https://ko-fi.com/manuelmoreale">become a member of my “One a Month” club.</a></p>                <hr>

It hasn't learned yet how to synthesize new ideas, it seems. And there are strong guardrails that keep it from going into certain areas. It is more capable than we know, therefore.

## Turbo9: a pipelined 6809 microprocessor IP

date: 2024-05-29, from: OS News

The Turbo9 is a pipelined microprocessor IP written in Verilog that executes a superset of the Motorola 6809 instruction set. It is a new modern microarchitecture with 16-bit internal datapaths that balances high performance vs small area / low power. The Turbo9R with a 16-bit memory interface achieves 0.69 DMIPS/MHz which is 3.8 times faster than Motorola&#8217;s original 8-bit MC6809 implementation. It is an active graduate research project at the Department of Electrical &#38; Computer Engineering at the University of Florida. ↫ Turbo9 GitHub page The Turbo9 is aimed at SoC sub-blocks and small mixed-signal ASIC, so it&#8217;s definitely not intended to be some sort of general purpose CPU. The reason for opting for the 6809 instead of, say, RISC-V or ARM, is that the 6809 enables a far smaller footprint due to being 16bit, which is all the target market really needs from the Turbo9. The current version of the Turbo9 is thoroughly verified and is capable of running C code. However, we still consider this version v0.9 because we are missing a few items. All the 6809 instructions and addressing modes have been implemented and tested except SYNC and CWAI. The signed versions of the Turbo9&#8217;s 16-bit divide and multiply need to be completed. Interrupts are partially implemented including SWI and Reset. ↫ Turbo9 GitHub page This is the kind of riveting content you&#8217;ll only really find on OSNews.

## Jef Raskin’s Canon Cat

date: 2024-05-28, from: OS News

Few things in technology excites me more than an amazing computer I have never heard of before &#8211; especially one with pedigree. Many people take a casual glance at this machine and say, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t that an overgrown word processor?&#8221; And one could certainly think so, in part because of its keyboard-centric operation, but mostly from the utterly uncomprehending way Canon advertised it in 1987. Canon dubbed the Cat a &#8220;work processor&#8221; because of its built-in telecommunications, modem and word processor even though Jef Raskin, its designer, had intended it as a &#8220;people&#8217;s computer&#8221; that could be inexpensive, accessible and fully functional — all things he had hoped to accomplish at Apple after first launching the Macintosh project, prior to departing in 1982. Canon, however, never fully grasped the concept either. Apart from the tone-deaf marketing, Canon sold the device through their typewriter division and required the display to only show what a daisywheel printer could generate, limiting its potential as a general purpose workstation. ↫ Cameron Kaiser Wait, wait, wait. You mean to tell me there&#8217;s a unique, well-designed computer that seemed ahead of its time, sold by a printer and copier company, that failed in the market due to botched marketing and grotesque misunderstanding among management of what the device is supposed to be? What are the odds this happens twice? The Canon Cat was designed and built by Jeff Raskin&#8217;s &#8211; of Macintosh fame &#8211; company Information Appliance, Inc., and licensed to Canon. It&#8217;s an all-in-one 68000-based computer with a bitmap display, an operating system stored in ROM, and a comprehensive Forth environment easily accessible despite the device autostarting to a word processor (because Canon). Much like some of the predecessor machines Raskin had worked on before licensing the Cat to Canon, the Cat has an intriguing input method that I&#8217;d never seen before. Instead of a mouse or even cursor keys, it has two keys labeled &#8220;Leap&#8221; that are used for manipulating the text cursor. In fact, there aren&#8217;t even conventional cursor keys. The Cat has the same &#8220;leap&#8221; keys as the Swyft and SwyftCard, in a bright but tasteful pink, and they work the same way to jump to portions of the document or into other documents. You can also use them to scroll with the SHIFT key, or move by single letters, sentences or paragraphs. The LEAP keys are also how you highlight text blocks to manipulate by LEAPing to the beginning, LEAPing to the end, and then pressing them together. ↫ Cameron Kaiser The Forth programming environment is also very interesting. It was hidden in that Canon didn&#8217;t really want you to use it, but Raskin&#8217;s company made no secret of it, and it was easily accessible. It uses a special dialect of Forth, which can be used at either a traditional OK prompt, or just by typing Forth code into the word processor, highlighting it, and executing it with a keyboard shortcut, after which any output will be displayed in the word processor as well. The Canon Cat was a market failure, and hence it shouldn&#8217;t be a surprise it&#8217;s exceedingly rare. The article further details the internals, some fixes that were required and performed, and much, much more. A follow-up article will delve deeper into the software, too.

## Microsoft published minimum system requirements, CPU support for Windows 11 LTSC 2024

date: 2024-05-28, from: OS News

Aside from that, the company also announced Windows 11 IoT Enterprise LTSC 2024 this week. The company has also published the minimum system requirements as well as supported processor families. They have been categorized as Preferred and Optional. Interestingly, SSD has been added as a minimum system requirement, which has been a rumour about the client OS since mid-2022. ↫ Sayan Sen at NeoWin The LTSC release, which is not really supposed to be used by average consumers, is still remarkably popular. It contains a fixed feature set and gets far fewer updates than regular Windows releases, it omits otherwise stock applications like Edge, and gives its users far more control over which updates are and are not installed. LTSC also enjoys 10 years of support from Microsoft. Interestingly enough, the minimum specifications for the IoT version of LTSC do not require a TPM 2.0, unlike the regular version of Windows, which infamously does require one. I would assume that the &#8220;preferred&#8221; minimum requirements, which does require TPM 2.0, line up very well with the minimum requirements for the regular LTSC version of Windows 11. Both will become available later this year, alongside the regular release of Windows 11 24H2.

Consuming content is what the majority of the people do most of the time online.  But what's the ideal ratio between consuming and creating content? I'd argue that a 100/0 split in favour of consumption is not ideal the same way a 0/100 also isn't. You need to consume at least some content in order to help your ideas evolve.</p>
<p>I posted 429 times on this site since January 1st, 2017. That's 429 posts in 2704 days or one every roughly 6 days. How many posts have I read in that same time span? Let's be conservative and assume I read 5 blog posts a day. That's more than 13500 blog posts and would put my consumption to creation ratio at around 97/3 which doesn't sound that much different than 100/0 but the actual, practical difference is huge. The difference is a blog with 429 posts in 7 and a half years.</p>
<p>Could that ratio be better? In theory yeah but how much better? Let's imagine I was posting once a day, every day. That would put my ratio at around 85/15. In order to go below that I'd either need to consume less content or I'd have to post more than once a day which, on a personal blog, it's completely unreasonable unless you treat your blog as a Twitter/Instagram replacement and that's not my case.</p>
<p>That 97/3 split, as I said, comes out of the very conservative assumption that I consume 5 posts a day. It doesn't take into consideration everything else I might consume: books, audio content, movies. If I were to factor in all that consumption I'd bet that my ratio is probably more close to 99/1 which sounds wrong but it really isn't when you stop to think about it.</p>
<p>I believe people should consume less content and produce more. Finding an output for creativity is important. But it's unreasonable to expect people to stop consuming content and replace that consumption with creation because the ratio will always be inevitably skewed towards consumption. And that's ok. If you're not a creative person, if you find hating yourself because you consume too much content and not create enough, embrace the fact that even a very tiny improvement, from 100/1 to 99.9/0.1 can mean a lot. It's the difference between letting your blog die and posting something a couple of times a year. Which is a substantial difference if you ask me!</p>
<p>Also, while I'm here talking about ratios, it's important to acknowledge the fact that not everyone can be creative in the same way. I often write that everyone should ditch social media and start blogging but the reality is that most people on social media are lurkers and for a lurker there's no point in having a blog. But, what you can do, is to engage with the people who do blog. Send them an email, let them know that you silently consume what they create, support what they do via tiny donations. It goes a long way.</p>                <hr>

## A common web component learning blunder

date: 2024-05-28, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>Through stalking the <a href="https://mastodon.social/tags/webcomponents">#WebComponents</a> hashtag and <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/courses/web-components/">my Frontend Masters course</a>, I’m privy to a lot of developers’ first experiences with web components. There’s a wide range of people digging in, but the most common first-time experience I come across is a developer coming from a classical component framework like React with JSX going straight to writing vanilla Web Components, becoming frustrated, and then deeming web components “not ready for primetime.”</p>
<p>Ignoring for a moment that web components <em>do</em> exist in the primetime and power some big and complex primetime web applications like Adobe’s Photoshop for Web, I half-understand this perspective. I understand the desire to not have a major dependency. I hate this bloated <code>node_modules</code> hellhole we’ve built over the last decade and while I’m not a <code>npm install</code> my problems away guy… I think this puritanical approach to dependencies is a misstep when diving into web components for the first time.</p>
<p>The analogy I’ve been using is that this is like jumping from a tall 130 kilobyte-story building (ReactDOM) right into the zero kilobyte sewers of web components. If you take anything from this post, please understand this: <em>web components (most likely) weren’t designed for you</em>. Not to dissuade you from using them, but they were <a href="https://blog.domenic.me/the-extensible-web/">purposefully designed</a> to be <a href="https://extensiblewebmanifesto.org/">a low-level bare metal primitive</a> for library authors to build on; they were designed to be used with a library, a thin layer of abstraction butter on top.</p>
<p>To understand this disparity further, let’s look at an example of what writing a component in a “modern” framework <em>feels</em> like…</p>

<p>This is a boring, imperative set of instructions for building the component with a little bit of <code>dangerouslySetInnerHTML</code><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> mixed in there… and ugchk… it sucks. It’s even more verbose with more interactive elements or a slew of reactive props and attributes.</p>
<p>Let’s see what 7 kilobytes of Lit gets us….</p>

</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Now we have a component that’s almost identical to the familiar world of JSX but <em>without any Babel transforms or build steps</em>. For 7 kilobytes you get a lot more than some syntactic sugar, you get…</p>
<ul>
<li>A thin, tree-shakeable layer of abstraction for a modern developer experience</li>
<li>Reactive updates without VDOM</li>
<li>A more granular component lifecycle with a <code>render()</code> function</li>
<li>A cleaner way of registering and using reactive attributes and properties without overloading the <code>attributeChangedCallback</code></li>
<li>Template directives like <code>@click</code> for event handling and directives for JavaScript values (arrays, objects, etc).</li>
<li>And an <code>html</code> tagged template literal with an under-appreciated superpower ✨ that gives your components atomic updates under-the-hood.</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s value in learning how bare metal vanilla web components work in the same way there’s value in knowing how <code>Intl.RelativeTimeFormat()</code> works, but you probably want to use <a href="https://day.js.org/">Day.js</a> for your day-to-day work. You can totally <a href="https://hawkticehurst.com/writing/bring-your-own-base-class/">write your own base class abstraction</a> – and I want you to have the <code>JeffElement</code> base class of your dreams, I do – but you may find out (<a href="https://www.abeautifulsite.net/posts/building-custom-elements-with-a-library/">like Cory LaViska from Shoelace found out</a>) that after you write all your little helper functions and utilities that you’ll end up with something almost the exact same size and feature set as Lit, but not as well supported nor as battle-tested.</p>
<p>This makes me sound anti-vanilla web components and I’m not that by any means. Vanilla web components are a perfect fit for <a href="https://github.com/davatron5000/awesome-standalones">standalone components</a> and the Light DOM-forward flavor of “<a href="https://adactio.com/journal/20618">HTML web components</a>”, but I think the people having the most fun in this space are JavaScript minimalists who already prefer writing vanilla JavaScript. People like myself.</p>
<p>“If I have to use a library how is this any different than any other framework lock-in?” This is a valid question and one worthy of its own post, but I think you’ll find the lock-in costs of a web component library pretty minimal. Because all web components libraries extend a common base class, there’s a linear pathway out of vendor lock-in if necessary.</p>
<p>What I’m saying is this; next time you’re thinking about jumping from 130 kilobytes of developer convenience, maybe consider giving yourself a 7 kilobyte landing pad to cushion the fall.</p>
<section class="footnotes">
<ol>
<li id="fn1">
<p>There’s ways around the <code>innerHTML</code> call like by writing the template in your HTML instead. <a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-backref">↩</a></p>

## Evolution of the ELF object file format

date: 2024-05-28, from: OS News

The ELF object file format is adopted by many UNIX-like operating systems. While I&#8217;ve previously delved into the control structures of ELF and its predecessors, tracing the historical evolution of ELF and its relationship with the System V ABI can be interesting in itself. ↫ MaskRay The article wasn&#8217;t lying. I had no reason to know this &#8211; and I&#8217;m pretty sure most of you didn&#8217;t either &#8211; but it turns out the standards that define ELF got caught up in the legal murkiness and nastiness of UNIX. After the dissolution of the committee governing ELF in 1995, stewardship went from one familiar name to the next, first Novell, then The Santa Cruz Operation, then Caldera which renamed itself to The SCO Group, and eventually ending up at UnXis (now Xinuos) in 2011. In 2015, the last maintainer of ELF left Xinuos, and since then, it&#8217;s been effectively unmaintained. Which is kind of wild, considering ELF is a crucial building block of virtually all UNIX and UNIX-like operating systems today. The article mentions there&#8217;s a neutral Google Group that discusses, among other things, ELF, but that, too, has seen dwindling activity. Still, that group has reached consensus on some changes; changes that are now not reflected in any of the official texts. It&#8217;s a bit of a mess. If you ever wanted to know the status of ELF as a standard, this article&#8217;s for you.

It's an incredible application, it will revolutionize how useful computers are to people, and the only people whose writing is ingested are employees of the companies. Not only will it increase utility, it will demonstrate in a very observable way how transformational the technology is. Probably will do nice things for the value of the stock too.

## 2024-05-23 Death and dying

date: 2024-05-28, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-05-23-death-and-dying">2024-05-23 Death and dying</h1>

<p>This is the first time somebody is dying in my close family where I am old enough to be an adult about it.</p>

<p>One of my sisters died when I was about twenty. I was living in Switzerland with my dad, and it was terrible to hear my mom crying at the phone, practically unable to tell me what had happened, to then see my father confused, shocked. I booked a flight for him but didn&rsquo;t go myself. My mom was living in Portugal with my two sisters. I wasn&rsquo;t there for my sister&rsquo;s burial. People had to be buried within 48 hours, back then. I don&rsquo;t know how things are now. There was school and stuff and I had not lived with my sisters for a few years. I didn&rsquo;t feel very close. It just felt weird. I didn&rsquo;t know what it was supposed to mean.</p>

<p>Now, thirty years later, my stepfather is dying. His kidneys are failing, his liver is failing, his lungs are filling up with water, his heart is failing; they can&rsquo;t give him his heart medication because the kidneys are at their limits, can&rsquo;t have him move around because he&rsquo;s weak, and so he&rsquo;s breaking down. I mean, he&rsquo;s calm, he knows what&rsquo;s happening, and he&rsquo;s very, very tired. He&rsquo;s ready to go.</p>

<p>I think that in my heart, I know that this is how it works. We have to go one day. I don&rsquo;t want to spend the last hours hooked up to machines. I&rsquo;ll be very, very tired. I&rsquo;ll just want to go home. I also won&rsquo;t want anybody around me to be sad. Hopefully, I&rsquo;ll feel that I lived a good life, that I had a good time, that the people I spend my time with were decent people, worthy of the short time I was given. I hope that I will be able to let go and be at peace. It&rsquo;s what I hear about my stepfather.</p>

<p>But when I sit in that family video call, with siblings in Portugal and Germany and my, and my mother, and one after another people start crying, choking up, it&rsquo;s hard. It&rsquo;s a that invisible choker, grabbing us, one after another.</p>

<p>I need to remember the good times, the conversations we had, the laughter we shared. I need to book a flight and see the rest of our family. All that independence and all that living abroad is coming back to haunt us, now.</p>

<p>To go and support each other.</p>

<p>Go and hug your loved ones.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Family">#Family</a></p>

<p><strong>2024-05-27</strong>. I arrived today. He didn’t look good at all. In fact, he seemed to be barely holding on to life. Sleeping, mostly. Occasionally, gasping for air, staring, maybe recognizing us, saying a word or two. It was heartbreaking. He died the same day. The doctor and the nurse came, two very friendly people. Removed the tubes, stopped the Morphium machine, made his death official.</p>

<p>There were so many tears. A step brother, a half-brother, a half-sister, my sister, my half-brother’s wife, their kid, my mom… the kid was the only one that seemed unperturbed. “Don’t be sad, grandma!”</p>

<p>Later the funerary services came to pick up the body. Again, both of them super nice. We’ll see how things go, tomorrow. My mother is not feeling well. I seem to be doing OK. I can be strong when it’s not my partner that has died.</p>

<p>I’m happy we were all there for him, singing songs, bringing him his birthday cake (he died on his 78th birthday). I’m happy we were all there for each other.</p>

<p><strong>2024-05-28</strong>. Cremation today. The sun is out. People on the radio.</p>

When you think about personal property, your home, clothes, and electronic devices probably come to mind. For NASA, personal property comprises government-owned government-held assets ranging from laptops to spacecraft and space station components. Managing the financial records for these assets is the responsibility of the Property Accounting Team, which includes Personal Property Accountant Britney Tang. [&#8230;]

## Ongoing Venus Volcanic Activity Discovered With NASA’s Magellan Data

date: 2024-05-27, from: NASA breaking news

An analysis of data from Magellan’s radar finds two volcanoes erupted in the early 1990s. This adds to the 2023 discovery of a different active volcano in Magellan data. Direct geological evidence of recent volcanic activity on Venus has been observed for a second time. Scientists in Italy analyzed archival data from NASA’s Magellan mission [&#8230;]

## MSI shows off motherboard with CAMM2 memory

date: 2024-05-27, from: OS News

Earlier this month, we talked about the arrival of the new CAMM2 memory module standard, specifically designed to make replaceable memory modules as fast and capable as soldered memory. There&#8217;s technically no reason for CAMM2 to not also be beneficial to desktop use, and it turns out MSI is experimenting with this. MSI on Thursday published the first image of a new desktop motherboard that supports the innovative DDR5 compression attached memory module (CAMM2). DDR5 CAMM2 modules are designed to improve upon the SO-DIMM form factor used for laptops, alleviating some of the high-speed signaling and capacity limitations of SO-DIMMs while also shaving down on the volume of space required. And while we&#8217;re eagerly awaiting to see CAMM2 show up in more laptops, its introduction in a PC motherboard comes as a bit of a surprise, since PCs aren&#8217;t nearly as space-constrained. ↫ Anton Shilov at AnandTech This MSI motherboard is a bit of an experiment, as it also contains other more experimental choices like back-mounted power connectors. While CAMM2&#8217;s space savings won&#8217;t mean much for most desktop builds, it does leave more room for CPU coolers, and it looks a bit cleaner, too.

## IceWM 3.5.0 released

date: 2024-05-27, from: OS News

IceWM, the venerable window manager we&#8217;ve all used at some point in our lives, has released a new version, 3.5.0. It&#8217;s a relatively minor release, so you&#8217;ve got things like a new install option which will install an extra theme, a fix for porting to NetBSD 10, translation updates, and more such small improvements. The AddressBar, a command line in the taskbar that can be summoned with ctrl+alt+space, also got some love, with file argument completion and support for the cd and pwd commands. You can compile IceWM yourself, of course, but it&#8217;ll most likely find its way into your distribution&#8217;s repository quickly enough.

## Episode 132 - The PDP-1

<p data-pm-slice="0 0 []">In 1959 the world bore witness to a new type of computer: the PDP-1. It was the first interactive computer to really make a dent in the market.

The best <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nwRiuh1Cug">campaign commercial</a> ever. So simple. A nostalgic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America_(Simon_%26_Garfunkel_song)">song</a>, beautifully performed. Stock footage of American workers and families, interspersed with video from campaign events. These things aren't complicated. I bet Bernie and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_%26_Garfunkel">S&G</a> would let Biden use the same format.

## Feynman's Garden

date: 2024-05-26, from: Marginallia log

The best description of my problem solving process is the Feynman algorithm, which is sometimes presented as a joke where the hidden subtext is &ldquo;be smart&rdquo;, but I disagree. The &ldquo;algorithm&rdquo; is a surprisingly lucid description of how thinking works in the context of hard problems where the answer can&rsquo;t simply be looked up or trivially broken down, iterated upon in a bottom-up fashion, or approached with similar methods.
Feynman&rsquo;s thinking algorithm is described like this:
