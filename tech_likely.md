After we came to Bloomington in the summer of 2021, we rented an apartment by Prospect Hill, a quiet dome of old houses just west of downtown. There we were surprised to hear, nearly every night, as many police and ambulance sirens as we&#8217;d heard in our Manhattan apartment. Helicopters too. Soon we realized why: [&#8230;]

## How to write a QML effect for KWin

date: 2024-03-19, from: OS News

In order solve that problem, we started looking for some options and the most obvious one was QtQuick. It’s a quite powerful framework and it’s already used extensively in Plasma. So, in Plasma 5.24, we introduced basic support for implementing kwin effects written in QML and even added a new overview effect. Unfortunately, if you wanted to implement a QtQuick-based effect yourself, you would still have to write a bit of C++ glue yourself. This is not great because effects that use C++ are a distribution nightmare. They can’t be just uploaded to the KDE Store and then installed by clicking “Get New Effects…”. Furthermore, libkwin is a fast moving target with lots of ABI and API incompatible changes in every release. That’s not good if you’re an effect developer because it means you will need to invest a bit of time after every plasma release to port the effects to the new APIs or at least rebuild the effects to resolve ABI incompatibilities. This has been changed in Plasma 6.0. In Plasma 6, we’ve had the opportunity to address that pesky problem of requiring some C++ code and also improve the declarative effect API after learning some lessons while working on the overview and other effects. So, enough of history and let’s jump to the good stuff, shall we? ↫ Vlad Zahorodnii Making it easier to write things like Plasma widgets and Kwin effects is always desirable, and making them easier to distribute is only icing on the cake.

## John Romero doesn’t believe in prototypes

date: 2024-03-19, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>A couple weeks ago I joined <a href="https://social.lol/@tylersticka/112005607463887992">a conversation about John Romero and prototypes</a>. <a href="https://cloudfour.com/thinks/the-possibility-bridge/">Tyler posted some thoughts about Romero’s autobiography</a>, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@matthiasott/112005791745972036">Matthias shared a quote from a Tim Ferris podcast</a> where Romero chided prototypes, and Matthias looped me in because I love prototypes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No prototypes. Just make the game. Polish as you go. Don’t depend on polish happening later. Always maintain constantly shippable code.<br />
– John Romero, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzqdZAYcwfY">Strange Loop 2002</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A quick internet conversation changed the course of my week a bit. After that short exchange I dove in and listened to podcasts, watched a handful of talks, and read an entire <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/doom-guy-life-in-first-person-john-romero/18230638?ean=9781419758119">autobiography</a>… and I’m still shocked that John Romero doesn’t believe in prototypes.</p>
<h2>id Software is synonymous with speed</h2>
<p>To understand Romero’s perspective you need to understand the ethos of id Software. id Software was –to borrow a gaming term– a “Press W” company, meaning they tend to plow through all obstacles to keep forward momentum. As Romero recounts in his biography, they prioritized speed above all other design principles.</p>
<ul>
<li>Speed in gameplay</li>
<li>Speed in development</li>
<li>Speed in using the latest tech</li>
<li>Speed in heavy metal MIDI soundtracks</li>
</ul>
<p>Romero and Carmack were also prolific developers. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Romero#Games">Romero has over 100 titles to his name</a> and in 1991 they released 15 games! And they did this while simultaneously pioneering 3D video game graphics for Wolfenstein 3D (1992) and  DOOM (1993).  How did they maintain such velocity?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Good division of labor.</strong> Carmack worked on the game engine, Romero on the level design, and Tom Hall did the art.</li>
<li><strong>They lived together.</strong> I’m not advocating for workplace cohabitation, but I think you need to acknowledge the contextual environment.</li>
<li><strong>Knew the hardware.</strong> Carmack and Romero were intimately familiar with the limitations of the hardware they were developing against which made porting games to other platforms (Commodore, Amiga, etc) a lot more predictable.</li>
<li><strong>Always rewriting</strong>. They were always rewriting using the latest tech. Take an existing title and use the latest graphic capabilities, take an existing title and make it with the latest engine, rinse and repeat.</li>
<li><strong>Built internal tools.</strong> Romero built internal tools to speed up level design: <a href="https://keenwiki.shikadi.net/wiki/TED5">TEd</a> (a text-based level editor), <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/DoomEd">DoomEd</a>, and <a href="https://quake.fandom.com/wiki/QuakeEd">QuakeEd</a>. Romero frequently talks about making DOOM levels in a single night.</li>
<li><strong>Predictable scope.</strong> While the underlying graphics or physics engine might change dramatically, the formula for the scope of the game (number episodes, levels, weapons, and types of enemies) stayed nearly the same so you could repeat processes, reduce code churn, and avoid surprise hardware limitations.</li>
</ul>
<p>That formula gave the team a lot of shots on goal. To use another sports metaphor, that’s a lot of reps. id Software was crunch time all the time. Abiding in that  breakneck thrill ride enabled them to create groundbreaking, industry-defining titles like DOOM and Quake.</p>
<h2>Back to prototypes and the lack thereof…</h2>
<p>Okay. Back to the main plot. John Romero doesn’t like prototypes…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“No prototypes. Just make the game. Polish as you go.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Speed is great, but process effects outcomes. In Romero’s own words “Don’t depend on polish happening later” which is something those of us in tech know all too well. You’re probably going to run up against “<a href="https://devopedia.org/iron-triangle">the Iron Triangle</a>” at some point.</p>
<p>I’m not trying to throw shade – I will never be as successful as id Software – but here’s a side-by-side of two similar side-scroller games.</p>
<figure>
<div class="gallery" style="display:grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; gap: var(--fluid-pad, 1.5vw); max-width: 640px;">
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/mario.png" alt="Super Mario Bros (1985)">
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/keen.png" alt="Commander Keen (1990)">
</div>
</figure>
<p>One is a game from a company that prioritizes prototyping and using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunpei_Yokoi#Lateral_Thinking_with_Withered_Technology">withered technology</a> (Super Mario Bros, 1985), the other is a clone of that game from a company that prioritizes shipping quick on the latest hardware (Commander Keen, 1990). This isn’t an attempt to strip the game of its technical achievements, bringing Nintendo-like games to the PC, but there’s a palpable difference between the two; one is timeless and one is timely. While a myriad of skill, staffing, and technology factors contribute to the difference<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>, I believe the biggest delta comes down to pressing the publish button too early.</p>
<p>There’s a <a href="https://www.acriticalhit.com/solved-miyamoto-quote-late-game-bad-forever">famously misattributed</a> quote that seems apropos here…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A delayed game is eventually good. A bad game is bad forever.”<br />
– Siobahn Beeman, often misattributed to Shigeru Miyamoto</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Who cares if some “<a href="https://arc.net/l/quote/brzalrzi">not spectacular</a>” graphics slipped out the door? That game, Commander Keen, was successful. id Software was successful. Over and over. From my perspective that comes down to the sheer volume of ideas they shipped, that continuous practice, and their novel shareware distribution model coinciding with the explosion of the internet and the PC. You need to be responsive and reactive to that wave and if there’s a commitment to release a new product every month, then I wouldn’t recommend a thinking tool like prototypes under those limitations either.</p>
<p>Do I –without evidence– believe they actually did prototype a bit? Yes. I think in the sense of experimenting with level design or evaluating community mods, they could cheaply explore new ideas with low effort thanks to their level editor tools. All those throwaway ideas amount to some level of what I’d call prototyping. But I take Romero’s point that they didn’t believe in prototyping, they were working on the product, not an idea, and could have hit publish at any point in the process.</p>
<p>So I’ll concede that maybe with a pair of once-in-a-generation talent, a perfect mixture of group workaholism, a breakneck cadence, all living in the same house, a convergence of new technologies, quality internal tools, the explosion of the home computer industry, an original and extremely violent IP that appealed to the Metallica generation, and over a hundred shots on goal… you too might be able to capture lightning in a bottle and create a smash hit like “the entire concept of 3D video games”…</p>
<p>… but for the rest of us there’s prototypes.</p>

## From ink to pixel to ink

date: 2024-03-19, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>I love books. I love reading books but I also love books as objects. And if you’re a designer—or passionate about design—chances are, you also love books. There’s something about the book, as an object, that managed to survive across all the various societal and technological changes.</p>
<p>In the 2010s, during the peak iPad era, people thought paper books were doomed. What’s the point of printing something when you can get hundreds, or even thousands of books inside a single device? And I’ll be honest with you, I went through that phase myself. For years I was only reading on an iPad. And it was great. Until it wasn’t.</p>
<p>There’s something about a printed book that technology can’t replace. I can’t tell you exactly why but I’m sure you know what I’m talking about. Reading a book, handling a book, smelling the ink and the paper, seeing it age over time, those are things that can’t be reproduced in the digital space.</p>
<p>I love books. I love when people pour their hearts and souls into creating great books. And I’m not just talking about the writing. Or the photographing. Or the illustrating. I’m talking about caring about the book itself, as an object.</p>
<p>That’s one of the reasons why I keep buying every book <a href="https://shop.specialprojects.jp">Craig Mod makes</a>. The man knows how to make great books. And you can feel it. You can instantly tell he loved the process as soon as you pick up one of his books.</p>
<p>I never had to make a book myself. I designed a few, back when I was studying graphic design more than a decade ago. But I did experience firsthand what it means to care about creating a great book. That’s because I watched Carl and my brother working together to create the first volume of the <a href="https://minimalissimo.shop/product/selection-architecture">Minimalissimo Selection</a> series. The final product is an incredibly simple object but creating simple objects is painfully hard.</p>
<figure class="m-o" data-template="with"><div class="m-m"><img class="img" loading="lazy" src="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/from-ink-to-pixel-to-ink/1adbc5322f-1710871916/book.jpeg" style="aspect-ratio:1000 / 1333"></div><figcaption>If you're into minimalism and architecture this is a book for you</figcaption></figure>
<p>Before websites like Minimalissimo were a thing, you had to buy books to find visual inspiration. And now you have books created as a result of years of curation of those same websites. From ink, to pixel, and back to ink.</p>
<p>The iPad didn’t manage to kill books the same way smartphones didn’t manage to kill traditional photography. The more we digitize the world the more analogue, physical objects become important. And as creators, it’s important to care about creating quality objects. Because as they say if is worth doing at all, is worth doing well.</p>
<hr />
<p>A final note about the lovely book Carl made. It was a limited run and there won’t be a second edition. But, <a href="https://minimalissimo.shop/product/selection-architecture">there are still copies left so if you want one I suggest you act fast</a>. Carl was also kind enough to set up a 25% discount for the readers of this site. Just use the <code>SELECTION25</code> code at checkout.</p>
<p>Also, if you love books, and coffee, and great filmmaking, Antonio Carusone created an amazing promotional video for the book that I’ll embed down below.</p>

## Tech Today: NASA Helps Find Where the Wildfires Are

## There is no EU cookie banner law

date: 2024-03-19, from: OS News

You know those modal screens that interrupt your groove when you are surfing? There are no laws forcing websites to use them. They use them because they choose to. ↫ Bite code! Cookie banners are not only not required, they&#8217;re not even needed, and most implementations you encounter today are illegal anyway. You can use session cookies and anonymous stats cookies without needing any user approval. Companies like to use these cookie banners because they want to make you mad at the law, not at them for tracking you up the wazzoo, and people who actually do know better trot out the cookie banners to enrage you at the government instead of at the corporations exploiting you. EU law only states that if a website wants to track you, they have to let you know. That&#8217;s it. Seems very reasonable to anyone who isn&#8217;t a corporatist.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-03-19, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

When they report on Trump’s financial situation they don’t take into account that the property, golf courses, buildings, etc are all mortgaged beyond the max, that’s what the NY trial was about, him lying about values for the purpose of getting loans on the property. So his equity in these investments is probably 0 or even negative (because of the fraud). No one is going to loan him anything on the properties, because he has no equity, and the story they tell about New York state liquidating his assets, there almost certainly is nothing to liquidate. Anyone who owns a home and has a mortgage can understand this, it works the same way even if the property is much more valuable than a family home. I asked jokingly what his credit rating must be, but it's a good question to ask, would help regular people relate to the situation.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-03-19, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

Developing great products is something like the NBA which they always say is a business, esp when a player you love is traded. Happened recently with a point guard, Immanuel Quickley, traded from Knicks to Raptors. He wasn't the only heart of the Knicks, but he was one of them. He has a competitive grace you don't see very often. Quickley was one of those guys you knew would be the starting point guard on some NBA team, he was that good. But he was unlikely to get there on the Knicks, so we can be happy for him because he is the starting point guard on the Raptors, but we lost something important there. But the business side, if done well, opens the door for bigger love. I love watching the Knicks win they way they are winning now. That's what I want from developing software. I want to create a global team of truly independent developers, filling the void left by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predation">predation</a> of the silos. There won't even be a business model for much of what we do, but there will be lots of teamwork and lots of fun, because the best accomplishment is when we do it as a team. We're going to play a game we started to play in the mid-90s, and somewhere somehow forgot we could still play it. We can. I am old now, I feel it, I can't produce end-user software much longer, but I don't want to leave until we have this thing rebooted.

## TrueNAS CORE 13 is the end of the FreeBSD version

date: 2024-03-19, from: OS News

Bad news from BSD land – the oldest vendor of BSD systems is changing direction away from FreeBSD and toward Linux. NAS vendor iXsystems has been busy this year, but apart from some statements in online user communities, it hasn&#8217;t been talking about the big news. Back in 2022, we covered TrueNAS CORE 13, the new release of its FreeBSD-based turnkey OS for NAS servers, and in that article we mentioned its new product, the Debian-based TrueNAS SCALE, aimed at providing storage for Kubernetes users. Now it seems the company is betting its future on that Linux-based product, meaning the end is in sight for the FreeBSD offering. ↫ Liam Proven at The Register Very sad to read, as more monoculture is not exactly great, but at the same time, from a corporate perspective, it&#8217;s also not entirely unexpected to focus on the server operating system with by far the widest industry support. I hope the fork mentioned in the article gains some steam, because having competition in this space is crucially important.

Blogroll fix. The blogroll was grabbing the up and down-arrow and Return for keyboard navigation, one of my favorite blogroll features. Put the cursor where you want, and arrow through the list. Press Return to expand, and again to collapse. Then down-arrow and repeat. But sometimes you want to use these keys for other functions. So I changed it so you have to click the blogroll to set the focus. Its border turns blueish, and the keys work as described. Press the Tab key or click outside the blogroll to take the focus off the blogroll.

I once thought I could make server products or toolkits for people I called "poets" -- motivated writers. I have given up on that, at least for the time-being. I think a properly motivated intelligent writer could get developer-like results, I've seen it happen (Brent Simmons, Dan MacTough). They make really good developers because they understand the user perspective so well, it still lives inside them. The problem seems to be motivation, and a poet knowing that they need to be super-motivated and have the time, to get <i>anything</i> technical to work. If they knew what was required, my 2024 theory goes, and had studied for it, the way they studied for their degree, they could not only be successful, but they could contribute to the developer process. Analogously, we all have to learn a little cooking just to get through life, but only a few people are chefs. <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/01/07/012112.html">Julia Child</a>, a hero of mine, believed she could teach anyone to be a good-enough cook.

<h2 id="trapped-in-the-iron-age">Trapped in the Iron Age</h2>
<p>In 1836, Danish antiquarian and curator Christian Jürgensen Thomsen distinguished three prehistorical eras based on the dominant materials used for weapons and cutting implements: the Stone Age, the Bronze Age, and the Iron Age.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Thomsen’s classification refers to the past, but according to his criteria, we have never evolved beyond the Iron Age. Even in the 21st century, iron remains the dominant material, not just for weapons and cutting implements but for about every modern technology.</p>
<p>We now use most iron in the form of steel. However, according to Thomsen’s criteria, we cannot speak of a “Steel Age.” First, steel is merely an alloy of iron (&gt;98%) and carbon (&lt;2%). Second, humans have been producing steel since the beginning of the Iron Age. That is a little-known fact in the Western world, where steel production only took off in the nineteenth century with fossil fuels. However, Asian and African metallurgists developed high-quality steels much earlier, and this knowledge eventually allowed Europeans to do the same – on a much larger scale.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>By 2021, the global iron and steel output reached 1,950 million tonnes (Mt). That is 22 times larger than the combined aluminum and copper output (88 Mt). The global iron and steel output corresponds to five times the global plastics output (391 Mt) and dwarfs the worldwide production of silicon (8.5 Mt) and lithium (0.1 Mt).<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> Steel is the fundamental material of industrial societies. Without plastics, lithium, or silicon, we would still be in an industrial society. Without iron and steel, we would be thrown back 3,000 years into the Bronze Age.</p>
<h2 id="where-is-all-that-steel">Where is all that steel?</h2>
<p>The massive presence of steel in industrial society is not so obvious.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> At home, we find several steel appliances such as the refrigerator, washing machine, water boiler, bathtub, and cooking, heating, and cooling appliances. However, only 2-3% of total steel production ends up in domestic appliances.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup><sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup><sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> Outdoors, there’s a lot of steel in the form of vehicles. These are especially passenger cars that use around 10% of all steel globally (20% in rich countries). Busses, trucks, trains, and ships add another 4-5%. Altogether that is still less than 20% of the global steel output.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most steel is embedded in other materials, located underground, or far away from residential areas.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most steel is embedded in other materials, located underground, or far away from residential areas. More than half of global steel production goes into construction, which includes buildings (residential, commercial, industrial) and infrastructures (bridges, tunnels, harbors, canals, runways, oil rigs, refineries, pipelines, power plants, transmission lines, railways, subways, and so on). Much of that steel is embedded in concrete. Reinforced concrete is the world’s primary building material, and concrete is the only material that can match the output of steel (1,819 Mt in 2021).</p>
<p>Roughly 15% of global steel production serves to make machinery, including machine tools, industrial equipment, electrical hardware, and construction, mining, and farming machines. Even products made of other materials – such as other metals, plastics, and wood – are shaped by steel tools.<sup id="fnref1:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> The final 15% of steel production ends up in a variety of objects, from screws over food packaging to furniture and shipping containers.<sup id="fnref1:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup><sup id="fnref1:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup><sup id="fnref1:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="the-environmental-footprint-of-the-steel-industry">The environmental footprint of the steel industry</h2>
<p>Steel is often presented as one of the most sustainable materials. Unlike plastics, steel can be recycled without any loss in quality. The steel industry has made great advances in energy efficiency, more so than many other industries. Making one ton of crude steel now requires roughly 20 gigajoules (GJ) of primary energy on average – three times less than in 1950.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> This compares very favorably to other materials such as aluminum (175 GJ/t), plastics (80-120 GJ/t), or copper (45 GJ/t).<sup id="fnref2:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> Unlike plastics, steel is a biodegradable material.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> Finally, iron ore is not in short supply. It makes up 5 percent of the Earth’s crust and is fourth in abundance among the elements.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> For comparison, copper only makes up 0.01%.<sup id="fnref2:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p>
<p>However, despite all these advantages, the global iron and steel industry consumes more energy and produces more carbon emissions than any other industry. The total primary energy use of crude steel production was 39 exajoules (EJ) in 2021, which corresponds to 7% of all energy used worldwide in that year (595 EJ). The greenhouse gas emissions are even higher because around 75% of energy use comes from coal – the fuel with the highest carbon emissions. In 2021, the iron and steel industry produced 3.3 Gt of carbon emissions, roughly 9% of global emissions (36.3 Gt).<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> The concrete industry follows closely with 8%.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The iron and steel industry consumes more energy and produces more carbon emissions than any other industry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The estimates above come from the <em>World Steel Association</em> and the <em>International Energy Agency</em>. These data are available for all metals and have been documented over a long period, allowing for historical comparisons. However, they only refer to the smelting of the metal. They do not include the energy use and carbon emissions for mining and transporting iron ore, coal, limestone, scrap, and steel products. Nor do they include the energy and emissions for coke production and ore preparation – all essential to the steel production process.<sup id="fnref3:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></p>
<p>Scientific studies that have set wider boundaries for the iron and steel industry conclude that the energy cost of steel production increases by 50% to 100%.<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> One report concludes that the methane emissions from metallurgical coal mining alone could increase emissions by 27%. Another study estimates that seaborne transport of iron ore and steel adds 10-15% extra emissions.<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup><sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup> Iron and steel production also create other environmental problems, such as high water use, solid waste production, and significant air and water pollution.</p>
<p>The carbon footprint of the iron and steel industry is incompatible with current ambitions to eliminate net carbon emissions by 2050, even less so because steel production is very likely to expand further. Steel production grew tenfold since 1950 and doubled between 2000 and 2020, growing faster than many researchers had predicted.<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup> Furthermore, efficiency gains have decreased, and there is a scientific consensus that current technologies have reached their thermodynamic limits.<sup id="fnref4:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup><sup id="fnref1:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup><sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup> During the last two decades, the average energy use for the production of 1 ton of steel has remained around 20 GJ/t.<sup id="fnref2:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup><sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="how-to-make-steel-without-fossil-fuels">How to make steel without fossil fuels?</h2>
<p>There are two ways to make steel, and one is much more sustainable than the other.<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup> On the one hand, there is the blast furnace or basic oxygen furnace, in which steel is made from iron ore and coal. This technology is – in its essential form – 2000 years old. On the other hand, there is the electric arc furnace, in which steel is made from steel scrap and electricity. The electric arc furnace, which is a relatively new technology, consumes much less energy than the blast furnace, makes use of a recycled resource (no need to mine iron ore), and works without the direct use of coal or other fossil fuels (the electricity can be supplied by solar, wind, or atomic power).</p>
<p>The most energy-efficient electric arc furnaces now consume less than 300 kilowatt-hours of electricity per ton of steel produced.<sup id="fnref3:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup><sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup> Hypothetically, if we had produced all steel in 2021 (1,950 Mt) in such furnaces, the total power consumption of the global iron and steel industry would have been only 585 terawatt-hours (Twh). That corresponds to just one-third of all electricity generated by wind turbines worldwide in the same year (1,848 Twh). Unfortunately, more than 70% of global steel output was made in blast furnaces fed by coal and iron ore.<sup id="fnref4:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup><sup id="fnref1:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup> A blast furnace consumes twenty times more energy and cannot be operated by electricity because coal is both the fuel source and the chemical reductant. The combustion of coal produces carbon monoxide that reduces the iron from its ore.<sup id="fnref5:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="not-enough-scrap-available">Not enough scrap available</h2>
<p>The solution seems obvious: let’s produce all that steel in electric arc furnaces. However, this is impossible. There’s not enough scrap available: the continuous growth of the global steel output makes a circular flow of resources impossible.<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup> It takes decades before most steel becomes available for recycling. For example, there is 543 Mt of steel stocked in ships.<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup> The scrap available for recycling in 2021 corresponds to the production level of 1965 when global steel production was less than one-quarter of what it is today (450 Mt).<sup id="fnref5:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup><sup id="fnref1:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup><sup id="fnref1:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup><sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup> Consequently, the other three quarters need to be produced in blast furnaces using coal and freshly mined iron ore.</p>

<p>Nowadays, China produces roughly half of the steel in the world and does that almost exclusively (+90%) in blast furnaces using coal and iron ore. Many other steelmaking nations have a higher share of electric arc furnaces. However, it makes little sense to point the finger at China. First, the US and Europe have outsourced many of their industries to China since the 2000s, a trend that corresponds neatly with the growing steel output in that country. Furthermore, twenty to forty years ago, China hardly used any steel. Consequently, there is almost no scrap available. China has no other choice than to use blast furnaces.<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="ever-higher-grades-of-steel">Ever higher grades of steel</h2>
<p>A second obstacle is the continuous development of higher grades of steel. There are now over 2,500 different types of steel with a variety of properties, such as increased strength, tolerance to high temperatures, or corrosion resistance.<sup id="fnref6:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup><sup id="fnref6:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup><sup id="fnref1:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup><sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup> Although these higher quality steels can be produced in electric arc furnaces, they are not made from scrap, and they have much higher energy use.</p>
<p>Steel available for recycling forms a mix of steel grades. That mix is suitable for making plain carbon steel but not highly alloyed steels, which require scrap with similar qualities. However, that scrap is not available. For example, stainless steel, the most produced special steel grade, has a recycling rate of only 15%. Almost 60 Mt of stainless steel was produced in 2021, compared to only 4 Mt in 1980.<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup> The traditional use of stainless steel was in cutlery, surgical tools, and medical and food processing equipment. However, it is now also used in the construction of tunnels and outdoor furniture, wastewater treatment, seawater desalination, nuclear engineering, and the production of biofuels.<sup id="fnref7:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></p>
<p>The low recycling rate and the need for the extraction of additional elements such as chrome and nickel make higher grades of steel more energy-intensive to produce. For example, stainless steel production requires almost 80 GJ per ton, four times more than the production of plain carbon steel.<sup id="fnref8:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup><sup id="fnref2:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup> The continuous development of higher-grade steels is stimulated by environmental legislation (such as the use of lighter steel in cars) and by competition from other materials, mainly aluminum and plastic composites.<sup id="fnref9:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup><sup id="fnref7:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup><sup id="fnref3:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup><sup id="fnref1:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup> Ironically, the competition with these materials, which consume even more energy, makes steel less and less sustainable.</p>
<h2 id="steel-and-renewable-energy">Steel and renewable energy</h2>
<p>The steel industry is heavily dependent on the energy supply, but the energy supply is also heavily dependent on the steel industry. Almost 10% of the global steel output goes into building and maintaining energy supply infrastructure. That amount corresponds to the entire steel output in 1950. A great share of that steel goes to gas and oil infrastructure.<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>. Oil and gas mining, production, and transportation require steel for offshore drilling platforms, pipelines, refineries, tankers, and storage tanks. Coal mining depends on steel for cutters, loaders, conveyors, excavators, and trucks.<sup id="fnref10:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the planned switch to low-carbon energy sources and the electrification of heating and transport technologies will not decrease our dependency on the steel industry – on the contrary. A low-carbon power grid requires much more steel (and other materials) than an infrastructure based on fossil fuels. Wind and solar power are very diffuse power sources compared to fossil fuels. Therefore, it takes much more materials (and land) to produce the same energy. In jargon, wind and solar have low “power density” or high “material intensity.”<sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup><sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup><sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup><sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup><sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A low-carbon power grid requires much more steel than an infrastructure based on fossil fuels.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The “steel intensity” of thermal gas and coal power plants is between 50 and 60 tonnes of steel per megawatt of installed power.<sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup> Hydroelectric power plants have a lower steel intensity, with 20-30 tonnes of steel per MW.<sup id="fnref11:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup><sup id="fnref1:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup> Atomic power’s steel intensity is also lower at between 20 and 40 tonnes of steel per installed MW.<sup id="fnref2:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup><sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup> On the other hand, solar PV requires between 40 and 170 tonnes of steel per installed MW.<sup id="fnref3:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup><sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup> Although there is little or no steel in the solar panels themselves, it’s the material of choice for the structures that support them.</p>
<h2 id="steel-and-wind-power">Steel and wind power</h2>
<p>The most steel-intensive power source – by far – is the modern wind turbine. The steel intensity of a wind turbine depends on its size. A single, large wind turbine requires significantly more steel per megawatt of installed power than two smaller wind turbines.<sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup> For example, a 3.6 MW wind turbine with a 100-meter tall tower requires 335 tons of steel (83 tons/MW), while a 5 MW wind turbine with a 150-meter tall tower needs 875 tons of steel (175 tons/MW).<sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup> The trend is towards taller wind turbines and a higher steel intensity.</p>

<p>Steel consumption further increases for offshore wind turbines. Onshore wind power plants rely on reinforced concrete for their foundations, but offshore wind turbines need massive steel structures such as monopiles and jackets.<sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup> The steel intensity for offshore wind turbines is calculated to be around 450 tonnes per MW for a 5 MW turbine – eight times higher than the steel intensity of a thermal power plant.<sup id="fnref1:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>. As these wind turbines get taller and move into deeper waters, their steel use further increases.</p>
<p>The most popular offshore wind turbine nowadays has a capacity of 7 MW, while the largest ones have a capacity of 14 MW.<sup id="fnref2:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup> If we make a conservative estimate based on the data above (the steel intensity doubles for every doubling of the power capacity), a 14 MW offshore wind turbine would require 1,300 tons of steel per MW or 18,200 tonnes in total. Such a wind turbine thus consumes 24 times more steel than a coal or gas power plant of the same power capacity.</p>
<h2 id="shorter-life-expectancy">Shorter life expectancy</h2>
<p>The difference between renewable power sources and fossil fuels becomes even larger if the steel intensity is calculated per unit of energy rather than power (MWh instead of MW). In contrast to coal and gas power plants, the output of wind and solar power plants depends on the weather, and they do not always produce their maximum power capacity. Therefore, replacing 1 MW of fossil electricity generation capacity requires the installation of (on average) 4 MW of solar power or 2 MW of wind power.<sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup> A 14 MW offshore wind turbine thus has a steel intensity that is almost 50 times higher than a fossil fuel power plant for every kilowatt-hour of electricity produced.<sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A 14 MW offshore wind turbine has a steel intensity that is almost 50 times higher than a fossil fuel power plant for every kilowatt-hour of electricity produced.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Solar and wind power plants also have shorter lifetimes (20-30 years) compared to thermal power plants (30-60 years).<sup id="fnref1:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup> While this does not affect the steel intensity per MW of power installed, it again increases the steel intensity per unit of energy produced over time. That does not always lead to a doubling of steel use because foundations for offshore wind turbines and structures for solar panels may have longer lifetimes than the power sources they support and could thus be reused.<sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="power-transmission-infrastructure">Power transmission infrastructure</h2>
<p>The data above only include the steel used in the power plants themselves. For fossil fuel power plants, they do not include the steel used in the pipelines, oil rigs, coal excavators, and the like. However, the same goes for the low-carbon power sources. Because they need much more resources than thermal power plants (steel but also other metals and materials), they depend on a global mining and transport infrastructure that is just as steel-intensive as the supply chain for fossil fuels.</p>
<p>Furthermore, because they are more diffuse power sources with intermittent and unpredictable power production, often located far away from energy consumption centers, renewable power plants drive the expansion of transmission infrastructure. That infrastructure is also based on steel – from switchyard equipment over towers to conduction cables.<sup id="fnref1:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup><sup id="fnref1:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup><sup id="fnref1:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup><sup id="fnref2:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup><sup id="fnref1:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup><sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup></p>
<p>Finally, low-carbon power sources also have a high need for special grades of steel, which are more energy-intensive to produce. Steel for off-shore wind turbines should resist corrosion, and stainless steel is increasingly used for solar panel support structures.<sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup> Electrical lamination steel (iron-silicon) is indispensable for transformers in the power network.<sup id="fnref12:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> Nuclear power plants may have a relatively low steel intensity but are completely built up of energy-intensive specialty steels. For example, cladding the fuel elements containing fissionable uranium requires zirconium steel, while all structural elements contain austenitic stainless steel.<sup id="fnref13:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup><sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="low-carbon-grid-cannot-be-made-from-recycled-steel">Low carbon grid cannot be made from recycled steel</h2>
<p>The high steel intensity of low carbon power sources confronts us with a so-called “catch-22”, a situation in which there seems to be no escape from a problem no matter what we do. We need much more steel if we replace thermal power plants with renewable ones. Because there is not enough steel scrap available, we can only produce that extra steel from iron ore in blast furnaces burning fossil fuels. To address climate change, we need to build low-carbon sources quickly and in great numbers. However, to achieve circular material flows and build low-carbon power sources from scrap and renewable electricity, we would have to do the opposite: slow down the development of a low-carbon power grid.</p>

<p>A well-cited study from 2013 concluded that if wind and solar power would supply 25,000 Twh of electricity – which corresponds to total global electricity demand in 2021 – we need about 3,200 Mt of steel to build the power plants alone.<sup id="fnref4:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup><sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup> Global electricity demand is projected to grow to between 52,000 and 71,000 terawatt-hours in 2050, which would increase the extra steel demand to between 6,400 and 8,960 Mt.<sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup> Spread out over the lifetime of solar panels and wind turbines (25 years), we would have to produce 256 to 358 Mt extra steel per year to make wind turbines and solar panel structures – comparable to the steel demand for passenger cars (195 Mt) and other transportation modes (98 Mt) combined.</p>
<p>That is still a very optimistic estimation. Electricity demand only makes up around 20% of total energy demand. If the total energy demand (177,000 Twh in 2021) would be supplied by wind and solar, we would need 22,400 Mt of steel. That’s an extra 896 Mt steel per year – as much as the global production in the early 2000s. You could argue that electricity can be used more efficiently than fossil fuels, for example, in cars and heating systems. However, at the same time, total energy demand is expected to rise further, countering the gains made by increased energy efficiency.</p>
<h2 id="the-high-tech-solutions">The high-tech solutions</h2>
<p>The steel industry counts on technological solutions to make steel production carbon neutral. One option is to replace coal by gas, an approach that is already common in the Middle East and North America. Gas-based steelmaking results in somewhat lower carbon emissions, but they are still much higher than in the case of the electric arc furnace. Therefore, most attention goes to hydrogen, which can replace purified coal (coke) as a reducing agent in a direct reduction shaft furnace.<sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup> However, hydrogen-based steelmaking does not offer an escape from the catch-22 because it further increases the need for a steel-intensive infrastructure.</p>
<p>The production of hydrogen is energy-intensive. It takes 50-55 kilowatt-hour to make 1 kg of hydrogen and 60 kg of hydrogen to make 1 ton of steel.<sup id="fnref1:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup> The production of 1 ton of steel from hydrogen thus consumes 3,000 kWh of electricity, which is ten times higher than the electricity use of an electric arc furnace making steel from scrap. Consequently, hydrogen-based steelmaking requires roughly ten times more wind turbines and solar panels than scrap-based steel production – and thus ten times more steel. On top of this comes the steel for building the pipelines and storage tanks that are part of the hydrogen infrastructure.</p>

<p>Carbon capture and storage, in which the carbon emissions of steelmaking plants are captured and then stored underground, faces the same problems. It requires a steel infrastructure and extra energy, thus indirectly raising the use of fossil fuels. Reverting to older, preindustrial steelmaking processes is not the answer either. Today&rsquo;s blast furnace is essentially still the blast furnace from earlier centuries, only much more energy efficient.<sup id="fnref14:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="the-low-tech-solutions">The low-tech solutions</h2>
<p>The picture painted above seems to offer little hope for carbon-neutral steelmaking and power production. However, there is a low-tech solution that could achieve it. We could adjust steel production to the available scrap supply both in quantity and quality. That would allow us to produce all steel from scrap in electric arc furnaces, dramatically reducing energy consumption and eliminating almost all carbon emissions. Of course, the intent should not be to replace steel with plastic composites and aluminum because they are even more energy-intensive to produce. The only solution is to reduce material use overall.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We could adjust steel production to the available scrap supply both in quantity and quality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reducing the steel output and using more common steel grades would not bring us back to the Bronze Age. As noted, global end-of-life ferrous scrap availability was approximately 450 Mt in 2021, which would allow us to produce roughly one-quarter of the current steel output. Furthermore, the scrap supply will continue to rise for the next 40 years, enabling us to produce more and more low-emission steel each year. By 2050, scrap availability is expected to rise to about 900 Mt, almost half of today’s global steel production.<sup id="fnref:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup> All that extra steel could be invested in expanding the low-carbon power grid without raising emissions first.</p>
<p>There is a lot of room to reduce the steel intensity of modern society. All our basic needs – and more – could be supplied with much less steel involved. For example, we could make cars lighter by making them smaller. That would bring energy savings without the need for energy-intensive high-grade steel. We could replace cars with bicycles and public transportation so that more people share less steel. Such changes would also reduce the need for steel in the road network, the energy infrastructure, and the manufacturing industry. We would need fewer machine tools, shipping containers, and reinforced concrete buildings. Whenever steel intensity is reduced, the advantages cascade throughout the whole system. Preventing corrosion and producing steel more locally from local resources would also reduce energy use and emissions.<sup id="fnref2:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup><sup id="fnref1:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup></p>
<p>The continuous growth of the steel output – the increasing steel intensity of human society – makes sustainable steel production impossible. No technology can change that because it’s not a technological problem. Like forestry can only be sustainable if the wood demand does not exceed the wood supply, steel is sustainable or not depending on the balance between (scrap) supply and (steel) demand. We may not be able to escape the Iron Age, but we have an option to escape the catch-22 that inextricably links steel production with fossil fuels.<sup id="fnref:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup></p>

<p>About 5% of global steel is produced by a third method: gas-based direct iron reduction. These furnaces use gas instead of coal and have therefore lower carbon emissions.

<p>In the West, the expansion of steel use happened over a period of 150 years, in tandem with technological evolution. In contrast, China compressed this technological evolution in just a few decades: shipping and railways, electrification, steel buildings, the car and the airplane, the internet, and renewable power technologies. There are still large parts of the world where the steel intensity of society is very low, such as India and Africa. There is thus still a lot of room for the growth of the steel output.

<p>For off-shore wind turbines, the lifetime of the foundations is estimated to be 100 years, so in principle they could serve for replacement wind turbines of the same size. On the other hand, it is not self-evident that these steel foundations will eventually be recycled. First, only around 10% of decommissioning costs can be recovered by recycling the metal, meaning that it is not economically and perhaps even energetically interesting to do it. Second, in some cass marine life has flourished around the foundations. The four offshore wind farms that had been decomissioned in 2019 lasted for 15, 18, 20 and 26 years.

<p>Another motivation for reducing the steel intensity of modern society is to limit the consequences of geopolitical conflicts. The more steel we produce for peaceful purposes, the more steel becomes available for war and destruction. Remarkably, the production of military equipment is absent from modern steel statistics, and if mentioned, its share is very low. However, in times of war, steelmaking facilities switch to producing steel for military purposes. The steel industry can thus be converted into a weapons industry at any moment, and there is now a lot more steel production capacity available than there has ever been in history.&#160;<a href="#fnref:49" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

## Mending Chesterton's Fence: Open Source Decision-making

date: 2024-03-18, from: Crossref Blog

<p>When each line of code is written it is surrounded by a sea of context: who in the community this is for, what problem we&rsquo;re trying to solve, what technical assumptions we&rsquo;re making, what we already tried but didn&rsquo;t work, how much coffee we&rsquo;ve had today. All of these have an effect on the software we write.</p>
<p>By the time the next person looks at that code, some of that context will have evaporated. There may be helpful code comments, tests, and specifications to explain how it should behave. But they don&rsquo;t explain the path not taken, and why we didn&rsquo;t take it. Or those occasions where the facts changed, so we changed our mind.</p>
<p>Some parts of our system are as old as Crossref itself. Whilst our process still involves coffee, it&rsquo;s safe to say that most of our working assumptions have changed, and for good reasons! We have to be very careful when working with our oldest code. We always consider why it was written that way, and what might have changed since. We&rsquo;re always on the look out for <a href="https://thoughtbot.com/blog/chestertons-fence" target="_blank">Chesterton&rsquo;s Fence</a>!</p>
<h2 id="leaving-a-trail">Leaving a Trail</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;re building a new generation of systems at Crossref, and as we go we&rsquo;re being deliberate about supporting the people who will maintain it.</p>
<p>When our oldest code was written, the software development team all worked in an office with a whiteboard or three, and the code was proprietary. Twenty years later, things are very different. The software development team is spread over 8 timezones. Thanks to <a href="https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/" target="_blank">POSI</a>, all the new code we write is open source, so the next people to read that code might not even be Crossref staff.</p>
<p>Working increasingly asynchronously, without that whiteboard, we need to record the options, collect evidence, and peer-review them within the team.</p>
<p>So for the past couple of years the software team has maintained a <a href="https://crossref.gitlab.io/engineering/decision-records/" target="_blank">decision register</a>. The first decision we recorded was that we should record decisions! Since then we have recorded the significant decisions as they arise. Plus some <a href="https://crossref.gitlab.io/engineering/decision-records/dr-0003/" target="_blank">historical ones</a>.</p>
<p>These aren&rsquo;t functional specifications, which describe what the system should do. It&rsquo;s the decisions and trade-offs we made along the way to get to the how. Look out for another blog post about specifications.</p>
<p>By leaving a trail of explanations as we go, we make it easier for people to understand why code was written, and what has changed. We&rsquo;re writing the story of our new systems. This makes it easier to alter the system in future in response to changes in our community, and the metadata they use.</p>
<h2 id="difficult-decisions">Difficult Decisions</h2>
<p>There are some fun challenges to building systems at Crossref. We have a lot of data. Our schema is very diverse, and has a vast amount of domain knowledge embedded in it. It&rsquo;s changed over time to accommodate 20 years of scholarly publishing innovations. Our community is diverse too, from small one-person publishers with a handful of articles, through to large ones that publish millions.</p>
<p>What might be an obvious decision for a database table with a thousand rows doesn&rsquo;t always translate to a million. When you get to a billion, things change again. An initially sensible choice might not scale. And a scalable solution might look over-engineered if we had millions of DOIs, rather than hundreds of millions.</p>
<p>The diversity of the data also poses challenges. A very simple feature might get complicated or expensive when it meets the heterogeneity of our metadata and membership. What might scale for journal article or grant metadata might not work for book chapters.</p>
<p>The big decisions need careful discussion, experimentation, and justification.</p>
<h2 id="2nf-or-not-2nf">2NF or not 2NF</h2>
<p>One such recent decision was how we structure our SQL schema for the database that powers our new &lsquo;relationships&rsquo; REST API endpoint, currently in development.</p>
<p>The data model is simple: we have a table of Relationships which connect pairs of Items. And each Item can have properties (such as a type). The way to model this is straightforward, following conventional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization" target="_blank">normalization rules</a>:</p>
<figure><img src="https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2024/open-source-decision-making/1.svg"
alt="SQL Tables, normalised" width="100%"/>
</figure>
<p>We built the API around it, and all was well.</p>
<p>We then added a feature which lets you look up relationships based on the properties of the subject or object. For example &ldquo;find citations where the subject is an article and the object is a dataset&rdquo;. This design worked well in our initial testing. We loaded more data into it, and it continued to work well.</p>
<p>And then, the context changed. Once we tested loading a billion relationships in the database, the performance dropped. The characteristics of the data: size, shape and distribution, reached a point where the database was unable to run queries in a timely way. The PostgreSQL query planner became unpredictable and occasionally produced some quite exciting query plans (to non-technical readers: databases are neither the time nor the place for excitement).</p>
<p>This is a normal experience in scaling up a system. We expected that something like this would happen at some point, but you don&rsquo;t know when it will happen until you try. We bounced around some ideas and came up with a couple of alternatives. Each made trade-offs around processing time, data storage and query flexibility. The best way to evaluate them was to use real data at a representative scale.</p>
<p>One of the options was denormalisation. This is a conventional solution to this kind of problem, but was not our first choice as it involves extra machinery to keep the data up-to-date, and more storage. It would not have been the correct solution for a smaller dataset. But we had the evidence that the other two approaches would not scale predictably.</p>
<figure><img src="https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2024/open-source-decision-making/2.svg"
alt="SQL Tables, normalised" width="100%"/>
</figure>
<br>
<p>By combining the data into one table, we can serve up API requests much more predictably, and with much better performance. This code is now running with the right performance. Technical readers note that this diagram is simplified. The <a href="https://gitlab.com/crossref/manifold/-/blob/62fc458b280e71c6b6221908fb7824bd3573726f/src/main/resources/db/migration/V1_0_0__initial_schema_creation.sql#L356" target="_blank">real SQL schema</a> is a little different.</p>
<p>Without writing this history down, and explaining what we tried, someone might misunderstand the reason for the code and try to simplify it. Decision record <a href="https://crossref.gitlab.io/engineering/decision-records/dr-0500/" target="_blank">DR-0500</a> guards against that.</p>
<p>But one day, when the context changes, future developers will be able to come back and modify the code, because they understand why it was like that in the first place.</p>

## Hackintosh is (almost) dead

date: 2024-03-17, from: OS News

It’s true that latest macOS 14 (Sonoma) still supports the latest generations of Intel Macs and it’s very likely that at least one or two major versions will still be compatible. But there’s one particular development that is de-facto killing off the Hackintosh scene. In Sonoma, Apple has completely removed all traces of driver support for their oldest WiFi/Bt cards, namely various Broadcom cards that they last used in 2012/13 iMac / MacBook models. Those Mac models are not supported by macOS for few years now thus it’s not surprising the drivers are being removed. Most likely reason is that Apple is moving drivers away from .kext (Kernel Extensions) to .dext (DriverKit) thus cleaning up obsolete and unused code from macOS. They did the same with Ethernet drivers in Ventura. ↫ Aleksandar Vacić Everybody, especially the small but active Hackintosh community itself, knew full well the writing was on the wall the day Apple switched to ARM, and we&#8217;re seeing the first signs of the impending end of the community. Sure, enough people will remain who are interested in building Hackintoshes using older, unsupported versions of macOS, kind of like retrocomputing, but the days of running the latest macOS release on non-Apple hardware are coming to an end. As a fun side note, this old OSNews article I wrote in 2009 is one of the most-visited articles on our site of all time. Hackintoshes were way, way more popular than people gave them credit for.

## Google adds “real-time, privacy-preserving URL protection” to Chrome

date: 2024-03-17, from: OS News

For more than 15 years, Google Safe Browsing has been protecting users from phishing, malware, unwanted software and more, by identifying and warning users about potentially abusive sites on more than 5 billion devices around the world. As attackers grow more sophisticated, we&#8217;ve seen the need for protections that can adapt as quickly as the threats they defend against. That’s why we&#8217;re excited to announce a new version of Safe Browsing that will provide real-time, privacy-preserving URL protection for people using the Standard protection mode of Safe Browsing in Chrome. ↫ Jasika Bawa, Xinghui Lu, Jonathan Li, and Alex Wozniak on the Google blog Reading through the description of how this new feature works, it does indeed seem to respect one&#8217;s privacy, but there could be so many devils in so many details here that you&#8217;d really need to be a specialist in these matters to truly gauge if Google isn&#8217;t getting its hands on the URLs you visit through this feature. But even if all that is true, it doesn&#8217;t really matter because Google has tons of other ways to collect more than enough data on you to build an exact profile of you are, and what advertisements will work well no you. Any time Google goes out of its way to announce it&#8217;s not collecting some type of data &#8211; like here, the URLs you type into the Chrome URL bar &#8211; it&#8217;s not because they care so much about your privacy, but because they simply don&#8217;t need this data to begin with.

## Technical writing in 2049

<p>A month ago, Lana Novikova <a href="https://twitter.com/_Unsolved_/status/1758039399684542664">asked me</a> to imagine the future of software documentation. What will software technical writing look like in, say, 2049, when our profession will be a century old? Will we be writing markup in git repositories or use ÜberDITA in space? Will our job still exist? I’ve put my futurist hat on to picture the shape of our profession 25 years from now. Buckle up!</p>

## RISC OS eXperience – 18th May

People in the United Kingdom who use RISC OS have plenty of opportunities to meet up with fellow users, with a number of user groups holding meetings on a regular basis, and a small number of main events &#8211; the shows, such as Wakefield and London. But what of our European friends? It&#8217;s possible for them to join some of the user group meetings when they&#8217;re held online and at a suitable time, as many are, but while doing so is an opportunity not to be missed where possible it&#8217;s&#8230;

## Fuzzing Ladybird with tools from Google Project Zero

date: 2024-03-17, from: OS News

While Ladybird does an okay job with well-formed web content, I thought it would be useful to throw some security research tools at it and see what kind of issues it might reveal. So today we’ll be using “Domato”, a DOM fuzzer from Google Project Zero, to stress test Ladybird and fix some issues found along the way. The way this works is that Domato generates randomized web pages with lots of mostly-valid but strange HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I then load these pages into a debug build of Ladybird and observe what happens. ↫ Andreas Kling I have high hopes for Ladybird.

## WAL-G 3.0.0 released

date: 2024-03-17, from: PostgreSQL News

<p>WAL-G team is happy to announce the release of WAL-G 3.0.0</p>
<p>WAL-G is a tool for archival database restoration for PostgreSQL, GreenplumDB, MySQL/MariaDB, MongoDB, etcd and several other databases.</p>
<h2>Noteworthy Changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Every database engine can now benefit from failover storage. This technique can save the day if one of the storage systems goes down. However, do not forget to monitor them anyway.</li>
<li>For Postgres, we have a WAL archiving daemon available. Its primary purpose is to improve the efficiency of parallel archiving.</li>
<li>Additionally, WAL-G supports the partial restoration of a cluster. If you have large, unnecessary tables, you can exclude them from the restoration process, the Postgres will skip over the WAL records for these tables. See <a href="https://github.com/wal-g/wal-g/blob/master/docs/PostgreSQL.md#partial-restore-experimental">docs</a> for details.</li>
<li>Greenplum's PITR (Point-in-Time Recovery) is undergoing its maturation process. Partial restore is supported in a similar way to Postgres. We now have tools to verify the integrity of AO\AOCS files in storage without actually restoring backups.</li>
</ul>
<p>WAL-G v3.0.0 is available for download on our <a href="https://github.com/wal-g/wal-g/releases">GitHub releases page</a>.</p>
<p>Have a nice day!</p>
