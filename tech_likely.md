## Red Hat Enterprise Linux 10 to remove X.org

date: 2023-11-28, from: OS News

With this, we’ve decided to remove Xorg server and other X servers (except Xwayland) from RHEL 10 and the following releases. Xwayland should be able to handle most X11 clients that won’t immediately be ported to Wayland, and if needed, our customers will be able to stay on RHEL 9 for its full life cycle while resolving the specifics needed for transitioning to a Wayland ecosystem. It’s important to note that “Xorg Server” and “X11” are not synonymous, X11 is a protocol that will continue to be supported through Xwayland, while the Xorg Server is one of the implementations of the X11 protocol. While we recognize the energy behind some distributions and Fedora spins moving towards a similar future, this decision is limited to RHEL 10—we recognize other Linux distributions have different needs and decision structures, and additionally we are not aware of plans for similar efforts in Fedora, nor are we involved in similar efforts besides sharing our knowledge. A sensible move, now that X.org is no longer really maintained and considered legacy software by everyone who has the skillset and knowledge to actually maintain it in the first place. I know a number of people are very upset about the move to Wayland, but with nobody left willing to work on X.org because it&#8217;s effectively unmaintainable, there&#8217;s really no other way to go. If you really want X.org to continue &#8211; perhaps you should channel the energy spent on writing angry online comments towards contributing to X.org. However, with even the most knowledgeable and capable X.org developers no longer wanting to have anything to do with X.org, you&#8217;re going to be in for a rough ride.

## Decentralized Finance Isn't

date: 2023-11-28, from: David Rosenthal's blog

A major theme of this blog since 2014's <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/10/economies-of-scale-in-peer-to-peer.html"><i>Economies of Scale in Peer-to-Peer Networks</i></a> has been that decentralized systems aren't, because economic forces overwhelm the technologies of decentralization. Last year I noted that this rule applied to Decentralized Finance (DeFi) in <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/03/shadow-banking-20.html"><i>Shadow Banking 2.0</i></a> based on Prof. Hilary Allen's <a href="https://ssrn.com/abstract=4038788"><i>DeFi: Shadow Banking 2.0?</i></a> which she summarizes thus:<br />
<blockquote>
TL;DR: DeFi is neither decentralized, nor very good finance, so regulators should have no qualms about clamping down on it to protect the stability of our financial system and broader economy. 
</blockquote>
And also <a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt2112b.htm"><i> DeFi risks and the decentralisation illusion </i></a> by Sirio Aramonte, Wenqian Huang and Andreas Schrimpf of the Bank for International Settlements who write:<br />
<blockquote>
While the main vision of DeFi’s proponents is intermediation without centralised entities, we argue that some form of centralisation is inevitable. As such, there is a “decentralisation illusion”. First and foremost, centralised governance is needed to take strategic and operational decisions. In addition, some features in DeFi, notably the consensus mechanism, favour a concentration of power.
</blockquote>
Below the fold I look at new evidence that the process of centralizing DeFi is essentially complete.<br />

In <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-16/defi-is-becoming-less-competitive-a-year-after-ftx-s-collapse-battered-crypto"><i>DeFi Is Becoming Less Competitive a Year After FTX’s Collapse Battered Crypto</i></a> Muyao Shen highlights the situation:<br />
<blockquote>
A small number of participants are dominating the world of decentralized finance as the crypto sector, which seeks to replicate financial markets without middlemen, still hasn’t recovered from FTX’s collapse a year ago.<br />

Shen uses <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-16/defi-is-becoming-less-competitive-a-year-after-ftx-s-collapse-battered-crypto">research from a "crypto-risk modeling company"</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Most categories in DeFi — from peer-to-peer lending to decentralized exchanges — are seeing capital largely held in a few major projects, according to data compiled by crypto-risk modeling company Gauntlet. The firm used a popular measure of market concentration and competition called the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index.
</blockquote>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herfindahl%E2%80%93Hirschman_index">Wikipedia</a> explains the HHI thus:<br />
<blockquote>
HHI is calculated by squaring the market share of each competing firm in the industry—expressed as either fractions, decimals, or whole numbers—and then summing the resulting numbers ... The result is proportional to the average market share, weighted by market share. As such, it can range from 0 to 1.0, moving from a huge number of very small firms to a single monopolistic producer.

In Shen's graph above the HHI is expressed in "points" from 0 to 10,000. Shen <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-16/defi-is-becoming-less-competitive-a-year-after-ftx-s-collapse-battered-crypto">comments</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Based on the metric, the most competition exists between decentralized finance exchanges, with the top four venues holding about 54% of total market share. Other categories including decentralized derivatives exchanges, DeFi lenders, and liquid staking, are much less competitive. For example, the top four liquid staking projects hold about 90% of total market share in that category, according to Gauntlet.

Shen provides a breakdown of the last 180 days revenue of DeFi projects, which I reformatted into this table. It shows that the top project, Lido, has 55% of the revenue, the top two have 2/3, and the top four projects have 78%. This is clearly a highly concentrated market, typical of cryptocurrency markets in general.<br />
<br />
Why does the centralization of Defi matter? First, for all the bad things concentration causes in general markets — see for example Matt Stoller's <a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/"><i>Big</i></a>. But more importantly, because the technologies of decentralization impose massive costs over and above those of equivalent centralized systems. The incentive to pay these additional costs is to reap the profits centralized systems sacrifice to regulation. If you are paying the costs but not evading regulation, what is the point? I discussed this in <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2023/02/economic-incentives.html"><i>Economic Incentives</i></a>.<br />
<br />
I've argued many times, most recently to the <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2023/09/brief-remarks-to-iosco-defi-wg.html">IOSCO DeFi Working Group</a>, that regulators should ignore the alleged "decentralization" of cryptocurrency systems and <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/12/dominoes.html">go after the major players</a> in each area. With lawsuits against <a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/?id=sam-bankman-fried-convicted">FTX' management</a>, <a href="https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2023/06/07/the-sec-sues-coinbase-its-on/">Coinbase</a>, <a href="https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2023/10/30/new-york-vs-dcg-genesis-and-gemini-kids-kids-youre-both-ugly/">DCG/Genesis and Gemini</a>, <a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/?id=kraken-sued-by-us-sec">Kraken</a>, and <a href="https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2023/07/15/crypto-collapse-alex-mashinsky-of-celsius-arrested-ripples-bizarre-xrp-win-gemini-sues-genesis-gisele-bundchen-knew-nothing/">Celsius and Alex Mashinsky</a>, and now their <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/binance-and-ceo-plead-guilty-federal-charges-4b-resolution">$4.3B criminal conviction of Binance and CZ</a>, the US regulators no longer seem to be going after the small fry. Presumably, they used winning against the small fry to build precedents they are now using against bigger fish.<br />
<br />
If despite claims of "decentralization" regulators can shut down the few big players in a market, the decentralized systems will be paying the massive extra costs but not reaping the unregulated profits. Of course, there is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whac-A-Mole">Whac-A-Mole</a> aspect; kill a big player and one or more smaller players will get bigger enough to be worth taking out. But it won't take many of these cycles for the market to get the message.<br />

## Housekeeping

date: 2023-11-28, from: Manu - I write blog

<p>Time for probably the final housekeeping post of 2023. I doubt I'll make a new one in December but we'll see.</p>
<hr />
<p>This site now runs on Kirby 4! I absolutely love Kirby, been using it to run this site since 2017 and I also used it for countless other projects. The <a href="https://getkirby.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">new V4 has officially been released</a> earlier today and the upgrade process went super smoothly. Only had to update 2 lines of code inside 1 single file and that was it. Stoked about that.</p>
<p>Next up, as mentioned in a previous post, Craig Mod has a new book out and copies are moving FAST. Signed copies have sold out in I think 24 hours and unsigned copies are also selling quickly. So if you want one, <a href="https://shop.specialprojects.jp/products/things-become-other-things-1st-ed/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">I suggest you act now and don&#039;t wait too long</a>.</p>
<p>Carl is <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/099-supply" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">running a campaign on Product Hunt</a> to spread the word about his 099. The project itself is neat and Carl has put a lot of effort into it so if you happen to be a PH user, just give it an upvote.</p>
<p>Lastly, an update from me: I'm busy as hell, working on way too many things at once but also excited because it's nice to have things to do, plus Christmas is approaching fast and that puts me in a good mood 🎄</p>

## Migrating from VM to Hierarchical Jails in FreeBSD

date: 2023-11-28, from: OS News

FreeBSD has supported nesting of jails natively since version 8.0, which dates back to 2009. Looking at the jail(8) man page, there is an entire paragraph named Hierarchical Jails that explains the concept of jail hierarchy well. It’s one of the many gems of FreeBSD that, although not widely known or used, is, in my opinion, extremely useful. BastilleBSD plays a central role in this article, and that&#8217;s a project I&#8217;ve been hearing a lot about recently. I feel like the various BSDs are currently hitting a stride, and there seems to be a lot of movement from Linux to BSD at the moment.

PipeWire 1.0 now has all the features that are expected to move media streams inside a system. It takes advantage of advanced features of the Linux kernel to provide low latency, low footprint, and high performance while being secure. It is the perfect tool to build an embedded system or to securely share streams between containers. Linux audio and video has come a long way, and PipeWire is part of that. Excellent work.

## This company just put the air in Apple’s MacBook Air

date: 2023-11-28, from: OS News

Frore Systems is a startup with $116 million in funding, and I’ve shown you its first product before: the AirJet Mini is a piezoelectric cooling chip that weighs just nine grams and is thinner than two US quarters stacked together. Each nominally consumes one watt and can remove 4.25 additional watts of heat. Here’s the question: what would happen if Frore used those AirJets to cool a laptop that normally doesn’t have a fan at all? What the company discovered — and I saw firsthand — is that Apple’s M2 chip can run faster, for longer, with Frore’s tech on board. Without it, a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air was like a runner that can’t sprint indefinitely without running out of breath. But with three AirJet Minis, the same laptop got a permanent second wind. Frore&#8217;s AirJet coolers have been featured on YouTube channels like LTT as well, and there&#8217;s no doubt in my mind these will be the future of laptop cooling, especially in the thinner segment of the laptop market. At least in thin laptops, AirJets are better in virtually every way than fans, and provide far superior cooling compared to fanless designs without adding bulk or noise. The only thing that sucks as an enthusiast is that you can&#8217;t really modify an existing laptop yourself. Either this company gets gobbled up by an OEM, or their products will make their way in almost every thin laptop.

## Google Play keeps banning the same web browser due to vague DMCA notices

date: 2023-11-28, from: OS News

App developer Elias Saba has had some bad luck with Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) takedowns. His Android TV app Downloader, which combines a web browser with a file manager, was suspended by Google Play in May after several Israeli TV companies complained that the app could be used to load a pirate website. Google reversed that suspension after three weeks. But Downloader has been suspended by Google Play again, and this time the reason is even harder to understand. Based on a vague DMCA notice, it appears that Downloader was suspended simply because it can load the Warner Bros. website. Application stores are basically random number generators. The worst possible applications, from non-functional garbage to ad-ridden gambling games designed to prey on children, make up the bulk of what&#8217;s on offer, but functional, useful applications spiral into Kafkaesque bureaucratic dark holes. Being a mobile developer in 2023 is a nightmare.

## Joint Statement on Research Data

date: 2023-11-28, from: Crossref Blog

<p>
<div style="float:right;margin:10px">
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/pdfs/stm-research-data-infographic-FINAL-4.pdf" title="Download PDF">
<img src="https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2023/stm-research-data-infographic-FINAL-4.jpg" width="400"/>
</a>
</div>
</p>
<p>STM, DataCite, and Crossref are pleased to announce an updated joint statement on research data.</p>
<p>In 2012, DataCite and STM drafted an <a href="https://www.stm-assoc.org/2012_06_14_STM_DataCite_Joint_Statement.pdf" target="_blank">initial joint statement</a> on the linkability and citability of research data. With nearly 10 million data citations tracked, thousands of repositories adopting data citation best practices, thousands of journals adopting data policies, data availability statements and establishing persistent links between articles and datasets, and the introduction of data policies by an increasing number of funders, there has been significant progress since. It now seems appropriate to focus on providing updated recommendations for the various stakeholders involved in research data sharing.</p>
<p>The premise of the original joint statement still stands: most stakeholders across the spectrum of researchers, funders, librarians and publishers agree about the benefits of making research data available and findable for reuse by others. This improves utility and rigor of the scholarly record. Still, research data sharing is not yet a self-evident step in the research lifecycle. We now have sufficient scholarly communication infrastructure in place to bring about widespread change and believe momentum is building for collective action.</p>
<p>It is in this context that DataCite, a global membership community working with over 2800 repositories around the world, and STM, whose membership consists of over 140 scientific, technical, and medical publishing organizations, are issuing this joint statement. Crossref, a nonprofit open infrastructure with over 18,000 institutional members from 150 countries, joins this call, recognising the need for an amplified focus on data citation. The aim of this statement is to accelerate adoption of best practices and policies, and encourage further development of critical policies in collaboration with a wide group of stakeholders.</p>
<p>Signatories of this statement recommend the following as best practice in research data sharing:</p>
<ol>
<li>When publishing their results, researchers deposit related research data and outputs in a trustworthy data repository that assigns persistent identifiers (DOIs where available). Researchers link to research data using persistent identifiers.</li>
<li>When using research data created by others, researchers provide attribution by citing the datasets in the reference section using persistent identifiers.</li>
<li>Data repositories enable sharing of research outputs in a FAIR way, including support for metadata quality and completeness.</li>
<li>Publishers set appropriate journal data policies, describing the way in which data is to be shared alongside the published article.</li>
<li>Publishers set instructions for authors to include Data Citations with persistent identifiers in the references section of articles.</li>
<li>Publishers include Data Citations and links to data in Data Availability Statements with persistent identifiers (DOIs where available) in the article metadata registered with Crossref.</li>
<li>In addition to Data Citations, Data Availability Statements (human- and machine-readable) are included in published articles where appropriate.</li>
<li>Repositories and publishers connect articles and datasets through persistent identifier connections in the metadata and reference lists.</li>
<li>Funders and research organizations provide researchers with guidance on open science practices, track compliance with open science policies where possible, and promote and incentivize researchers to openly share, cite and link research data.</li>
<li>Funders, policymaking institutions, publishers and research organizations collaborate towards aligning FAIR research data policies and guidelines.</li>
<li>All stakeholders collaborate in the development of tools, processes, and incentives throughout the research cycle to enable sharing of high-quality research data, making all steps in the process clear, easy and efficient for researchers by providing support and guidance.</li>
<li>Stakeholders responsible for research assessment take into account data sharing and data citation in their reward and recognition system structures.</li>
</ol>
<p>We, the following signatories shall adopt and promote the relevant best practices laid out above. We hope that our action inspires the community, including researchers, research funders, research institutions, data repositories and publishers, to join us in making it easy for researchers to share, link and cite research data.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Anc6EAs02YTveU3PqELJU2jnTK1R84hMWgB9kNX01p0/edit" target="_blank">Endorse the statement here.</a></p>

## Building a NetBSD ramdisk kernel

date: 2023-11-27, from: OS News

When I used OpenBSD, I was a big fan of bsd.rd: a kernel that includes a root file system with an installer and a few tools. When I invariably did something bad to my root file system, I could use that to repair things. bsd.rd is also helpful for OS updates. And there is only a single file involved. On NetBSD however, there is usually no netbsd.rd kernel installed, or even available by default. The facility is there, it’s just not standard. To be fair, there are a number of architectures that use kernels with a ramdisk for installation. Recently, I have been toying with NetBSD on an Orange Pi 5. This is a 64-bit ARM board, using the evbarm-aarch64 architecture. I am booting from an SD card (details in a followup post) but once booted, the kernel does not see the card any more, only the NVMe SSD. So my thoughts went back to bsd.rd and I decided that I want one! Such a kernel seems like a very useful tool to have, so if you&#8217;re running NetBSD &#8211; this guide will help you add it to your toolbox.

## Schatzkarten

date: 2023-11-27, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1>Schatzkarten</h1>

<p>Schatzkarten als Teil der Schätze sind wichtig, weil sie kleine Aufgaben darstellen. Wenn das Ziel in der Nähe ist, sei es im Nachbarhex bei der Reise Überland oder in einem Raum in der Nähe im Megadungeon, der Effekt ist immer gleich.</p>

<p>Die Spielerinnen und Spieler freuen sich! Das ist das wichtigste.</p>

<p>Es ist eine Ablenkung von was auch immer Spielerinnen und Spieler sonst vor haben. Ablenkung ist für mich eine wichtige Herausforderung im Spiel. Wie sehr will ich als Spieler etwas? Wenn ich mich ständig ablenken lasse, dann war es mir vielleicht eben doch nicht so wichtig.</p>

<p>Es ist eine Einladung, ein grösseres Risiko einzugehen. Meistens zeigt die Schatzkarte ja in das unbekannte Gebiet. Haben wir noch genug Trefferpunkte, Zaubersprüche und andere Ressourcen? Wollen wir es wagen?</p>

<p>Deswegen dürfen Schatzkarten nicht auf Schätze verweisen, die zu weit weg sind oder die erst in einem halben dutzend Spielabenden erreicht werden können. Zudem sind Schatzkarten ja eine Belohnung, deswegen sollten die Fundorte nicht nochmal speziell geschützt sein, denn sonst wäre der Schatz ja den neuen Wächtern zuzurechnen. Nein, falls es am Ort neue Wächter hat, dann haben diese ebenfalls Schätze.</p>

<p>Soviel zur Vorrede. Für <a href="Horte">Horte</a> habe ich im Moment folgende Liste:</p>

<ol>
<li>Karte zu einem Grab einer verarmten Adligen oder eines verarmten Adligen: dort hat es einen Ring mit einem Edelstein</li>
<li>Karte zu einem Grab einer Adelsfamilie: 1 Juwel und 3W6 Edelsteine</li>
<li>Karte zu einem Versteck von Herrschaftszeichen: 1W6 Juwelen (Krone, Zepter, Ringe, Halskette, Armreif, Kelch)</li>
<li>Karte zu einem Versteck von Devotionalien: 1W6 Juwelen (Statuen, Miniaturen, Kelche, Schüsseln, Ikonen, heilige Schriften)</li>
<li>Karte zu einem Versteck von Geflohenen: 1W6×1000 Gold</li>
<li>Karte zu einem Versteck für den Notfall: 2W6 Edelsteine, 2W6×10 Gold</li>
<li>Karte zu einer Schatztruhe: 1W6×1000 Silber, 1W6×1000 Gold, 1W6 Juwelen</li>
<li>Karte zu einer Truhe mit Heeressold: 2W6×1000 Silber, 2W6×1000 Gold</li>
<li>Karte zu einem verlorenen Schrein: Statue im Wert von 1W6×1000 Gold</li>
<li>Karte zu einem verlorenen Tempel: 1W6 Statuen im Wert von je 1W6×1000 Gold</li>
<li>Karte zum Grab einer alten Heldin mit einer Waffe (S. 27).</li>
<li>Karte zum Grab eines alten Helden mit einer Waffe (S. 27).</li>
<li>Karte zum Grab einer alten Heldin mit einer Rüstung (S. 28).</li>
<li>Karte zum Grab eines alten Helden mit einer Rüstung (S. 28).</li>
<li>Karte zum Grab einer alten Magierin mit einem Ring (S. 29).</li>
<li>Karte zum Grab eines alten Magiers mit einem Ring (S. 29).</li>
<li>Karte zum Grab eines alten Magiers mit einem Zauberstab (S. 29).</li>
<li>Karte zum Grab einer alten Magierin mit einem Zauberstab (S. 29).</li>
<li>Karte zu einem alten Beschwörungszirkel mit dem Namen eines Dämons, z.B. eines Krakendämons (S. 35).</li>
<li>Karte zu einem alten Portal in eine andere Welt (S. 36).</li>
</ol>

<p>Jetzt brauche ich noch eine Namensliste für die Begrabenen…</p>

<p>Die Portale in andere Welten beziehen sich natürlich auf die <a href="2023-11-21-kosmologie">Kosmologie</a>. Die <a href="2023-11-18-magische-waffen">magischen Waffen</a> wurden auch schon besprochen.</p>

## Super tiny Windows 11 OS gets a big update: Tiny11 2311 shrinks 20% and allows cumulative updates

date: 2023-11-27, from: OS News

NTDEV, the developer behind Tiny11, has released a new update for its miniature Windows 11 operating system, called Tiny11 2311, that adds Microsoft&#8217;s latest feature update, 23H2, into the OS and introduces a plethora of bug fixes addressing issues in the outgoing version of Tiny11. On top of this, the new update also shrinks Tiny11&#8217;s install size by a whopping 20%, making Tiny11&#8217;s renowned footprint even smaller. There is absolutely no need for Windows 11 to be as big and invasive as it is, and it feels like such a shame and missed opportunity to burden an otherwise good and capable operating system with such cruft and useless junk.

## Human connection

date: 2023-11-26, from: Manu - I write blog

<p>In a <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/on-creating-beautiful-things">recent post</a> I mentioned that I am a <em>sucker for signed books and limited editions</em>. The reason for that has nothing to do with the uniqueness of a signed object or its potential extra monetary value. Those are all aspects that have no meaning to me. The reason why I love signed books it’s the same reason why I love handmade objects: the human connection. Knowing that someone picked up that book and took a second to open it up and sign it adds that extra something that makes my brain happy.</p>
<p>And in a world that’s more and more digital and artificial, I think these small human touches are going to become increasingly more valuable.</p>

## How Apple’s developers reflashed Mac ROMs in the ’90s

date: 2023-11-26, from: OS News

After I wrote about the possibility of programmable Mac ROM SIMMs in Quadras a couple of months ago, I suspected that there had been a way for developers at Apple in the 68k Mac era to reflash the ROM in their Macs during development, just like BIOS updates on PCs. The reason I believed this is because the ROM SIMM socket in the Quadras brought out pins for 12V (VPP) and write enable (/WE). I had verified that the write enable pin was going into the memory controller chip in several Mac models, so I was pretty confident that in-system programming was possible. As luck would have it, multiple people pointed out to me that an Apple internal utility used for ROM flashing had been uploaded to the Macintosh Garden. It was recovered from a prototype PowerBook 520 purchased in 2020. Of course, I had to download this utility and figure out how it works. I honestly cannot believe it&#8217;s taken this long for such a tool to become available one way or the other. Classic Macs are incredibly popular in the retro community, and being able to reflash the ROMs like this is incredibly useful. It took some work and disassembly, but Doug Brown got it working.

## Debian’s MIPS64EL CPU port is at risk due to declining hardware access

date: 2023-11-26, from: OS News

Debian&#8217;s MIPS64EL that is a 64-bit little endian port using the N64 ABI is at risk due to declining access for building the Debian 64-bit MIPS packages. MIPS64EL is now being treated as an &#8220;out of sync&#8221; architecture due to lacking sufficient build daemon resources for timely building new packages and if the situation doesn&#8217;t improve, it may not be suitable as a release architecture for Debian 13 &#8220;Trixie&#8221;. Not all architectures last forever, and as time goes on, more and more of these once promising architectures will simply no longer be part of the modern Linux world. It makes sense &#8211; but it&#8217;s still sad.

## A quick look back at Microsoft’s first sports video game: Microsoft Olympic Decathlon

date: 2023-11-26, from: OS News

Ironically, the second commercial game that Microsoft published, after Microsoft Adventure in 1979, was an attempt at a sports game sim. It was called Microsoft Olympic Decathlon, and like Microsoft Adventure, it was first launched as a TRS-80 PC game, this time in 1980. Microsoft has so many unexpected products in its long history.

It does the job I wanted it to do, presents in one user interface the content of my blog, linkblog, and several timelines from FeedLand. The previous version had the tab links <a href="http://scripting.com/2023/11/24/190107.html">down the left edge</a>. I loved the way it looked on my desktop system, but then I tried it on my iPad, and realized it didn't work. Not enough horizonal real estate to pull it off. So I went back to the tabs-across-the-top format. I had to drop one of the tabs, and not use the nice Font-Awesome icons I used previously on Scripting News when there was <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/11/26/currentScriptingHome.png">plenty of room</a>.

<a href="https://colinwalker.blog/blog/?date=2023-11-26#p1">Colin Walker wonders</a> if he should try <a href="https://bsky.app/">Bluesky</a>. I say yes. At first I was pretty negative, after the implosion of Twitter, here was another <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Dorsey">Jack Dorsey</a> network. I wasn't in the mood. But eventually I tried it, and I liked it very much. The mood is civil and often artistic. There are some very creative people there. And I think the API, while it's <a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/892d671e-1dc9-4ffc-9101-cadbca842adc">inscrutable</a> to me, is understandable to developers who put their minds to it, and I expect Colin is one who will figure it out. And I don't think there's any hope of ActivityPub, it's far too underspecified, and interop is likely to be product-based, not based on the protocol, where the Bluesky protocol appears to be overly-well-thought-out, or maybe the docs could have more examples. I didn't have the time to dive into it when I looked.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2023-11-26, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/11/26/oppenheimer.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Watched <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/oppenheimer/">Oppenheimer</a> last night. Very good movie. I like the artistic flourishes, reminds me of another movie I watched recently and liked, a lot, <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/spencer/">Spencer</a>. I wasn't really interested in the life and death of Lady Di, but I also got through the latest episodes of The Crown, which I had resisted when the newest Queen was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crown_(season_5)">introduced</a>. I find it hard to make the adjustment to new actors playing the roles of characters I had come to love, esp <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claire_Foy">Claire Foy</a> as young Queen Elizabeth, a fantastic actress who played in one of the most spectacular dramatic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBwQICiGRmw">scenes</a> anywhere anytime. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crown_(season_6)">latest episodes</a> of The Crown were about Diana mostly, and were fantastic. Back to Oppenheimer. I'll try not to spoil it too much, but the drama is puzzling, why are they going after Oppenheimer when he miraculously put together the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Project">Manhattan Project</a> which created, in a race with Germany and the USSR, the bomb that ended World War II. The final scene, a flashback to an earlier scene where we didn't hear the dialog, between Oppenheimer and his colleague at Princeton, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein">Albert Einstein</a>, about what happens when you create something that changes the direction of humanity. What happens is this -- they push you aside. I'm not comparing myself to these two giants, but I have had the same question about how tech reacted to my contributions. My conclusion was that our culture has reason to erase the accomplishments of outliers. We prefer innovation to come in nice predictable packages, with a PR person on top, and when that's disturbed, we close ranks to make it all appear very ordinary. Anyway, all of this is very good holiday entertainment and thought provoking. My next adventure in video is <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/tv/pachinko/">Pachinko</a> on Apple TV, which is somewhat confusing, but keeps me coming back, it's so compelling. I still have the last seasons of <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/tv/ted-lasso/">Ted Lasso</a> and <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/tv/reservation-dogs/">Reservation Dogs</a> in the queue. And of course there's a new season of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fargo_(season_5)">Fargo</a>, which I'm sure I'll love. Right now my plan is to wait for the series to end and watch it all in a binge.

## “you have hacked into my devices”

date: 2023-11-26, from: Daniel Stenberg Blog

I&#8217;ve shown you email examples many times before. Today I received this. I don&#8217;t know this person. Clearly a troubled individual. I suspect she found my name and address somewhere and then managed to put me somewhere in the middle of the conspiracy against her. The entire mail is written in a single paragraph and &#8230; <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2023/11/26/you-have-hacked-into-my-devices/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">&#8220;you have hacked into my devices&#8221;</span> <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>
