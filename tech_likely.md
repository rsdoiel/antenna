## Google is bringing Fuchsia OS to Android devices, but not in the way you’d think

date: 2024-07-05, from: OS News

To evolve Fuchsia beyond smart home devices, Google has been working on projects such as Starnix to run unmodified Linux binaries on Fuchsia devices. In addition, since late April of this year, Google has been working on a new project called “microfuchsia” that aims to make Fuchsia bootable on existing devices via virtualization. Microfuchsia, according to Google, is a Fuchsia OS build that targets virtual machines and is designed to be bootable in virtualization solutions such as QEMU and pKVM. ↫ Mishaal Rahman at Android Authority The goal here might be, according to Mishaal Rahman, might be to use this new microfuchsia thing to replace the stripped-down Android version that&#8217;s currently being used inside Android&#8217;s pKVM to run certain secured workloads. Relevant patches have been submitted to both the Fuchsia and Android side of things for this very purpose. At this point, it really seems that Google&#8217;s grand ambitions with Fuchsia simply didn&#8217;t survive the massive employee culling, with leadership probably reasoning that Android and Chrome OS are good enough, and that replacing them with something homegrown and possibly more suited &#8211; speculation, of course &#8211; simply isn&#8217;t worth the investment in both time and money. It probably makes sense from a financial standpoint, but it&#8217;s still sad.

## Apple bows to Russian censorship once more, removes VPN apps from Russian App Store

date: 2024-07-05, from: OS News

A few weeks ago, I broke the news that Mozilla had removed several anti-censorship Firefox extensions from its store in Russia, and a few days later I also broke the news they reversed course on their decision and reinstated the extensions. Perhaps not worthy of a beauty prize, as a Dutch saying goes, but at least the turnaround time was short, and they did the right thing in the end. Well, let&#8217;s see how Apple is going to deal with the exact same situation. Novaya Gazeta Europe reports that bowing under pressure from the same Russian censors that targeted Mozilla, the company has removed a whole slew of VPN applications used by Russians to evade the stringent totalitarian censorship laws in the warmongering nation. Apple has removed several apps offering virtual private network (VPN) services from the Russian AppStore, following a request from Roskomnadzor, Russia’s media regulator, independent news outlet Mediazona reported on Thursday. The VPN services removed by Apple include leading services such as ProtonVPN, Red Shield VPN, NordVPN and Le VPN. Those living in Russia will no longer be able to download the services, while users who already have them on their phones can continue using them, but will be unable to update them. ↫ Novaya Gazeta Europe Apple has a long history of falling in line with the demands from dictators and totalitarian regimes, and Russia is no stranger to telling Apple what to do. Earlier this year, Apple was ordered to remove an application developed by the team of the murdered opposition figure Alexey Navalny, and of course, Apple rolled over and complied. Much like Apple&#8217;s grotesque suck-up behaviour in China, This stands in stark contrast to Apple&#8217;s whining, complaining, and tantrums in the European Union. It seems Apple finds it more comfortable to operating under dictators than in democracies.

## Psion OPL: when we owned our devices

date: 2024-07-05, from: OS News

We talked about Psion last week, and we&#8217;re talking about Psion again this week. This time, Kian Ryan highlights a very important capability of Psion&#8217;s devices, a capability that&#8217;s entirely absent from today&#8217;s mobile devices: a built-in IDE and dedicated programming language so you can write code and build applications, including ones with a graphical user interface, right on the device. All Psion devices could run OPL, either preinstalled on the device or via a DATAPAK memory card. It&#8217;s a BASIC-esque programming language, and while you could develop OPL programs on your PC in DOS, Psion devices also shipped with an IDE preinstalled so you could get just as much done on the device itself. Back then, this wasn&#8217;t particularly unique, but these days, mobile devices have become so locked-down and dumb that developing applications on-device is basically a non-starter. Which can’t be said about my current mobile. My mobile is a great device to consume content on, but it has no built in tools to extend its functionality. If I want to build an application for it, I have to use another computer to download a build environment, build the application, sign it, and then transfer the packaged app to my phone. On the Psion, all the tools are right there, on my home screen. It does feel like we’re missing an opportunity here. ↫ Kian Ryan They&#8217;re entirely right, of course. Our current mobile devices are faster and technically more capable than ever, but extending the functionality of your smartphone using the smartphone itself by writing and compiling code on it is far more cumbersome than it was in the past. Even my Psion Organiser II LZ64, from 1986, has OPL on it, and if I took the time to relearn the basic BASIC I once knew, I could probably still program something useful on it today, almost 40 years later, without being gatekept by anyone, and without needing any other device. That&#8217;s something quite magical that we&#8217;ve lost, and that&#8217;s sad.

Will Baude: The court is motivated by statesmanship, which the country sorely needs today. The problem is that this statesmanship is a form of the kind of outcome-oriented policymaking that the court disparages in other contexts. It trusts states to handle the homelessness crisis but not ballot access for insurrectionists, even though the Constitution trusts [&#8230;]

## Moving to an RTOS on the RP2040

date: 2024-07-05, from: OS News

I&#8217;ve been working on a bunch of small projects involving microcontrollers. Currently a lot of them are based around the Raspberry Pi Pico boards because I like the development experience of those a lot. They have a decent SDK and cheap hardware to get started and the debugger works with gdb/openocd so it just integrates in all IDEs that support that. One of my current projects is making a fancy hardware controller for a bunch of video equipment I use. The main things that will be controlled are two PTZ cameras (those are cameras that have motors to move them). One stationary camera and the video switching equipment that that&#8217;s hooked up to. ↫ Martijn Braam There&#8217;s more to building something like this than connecting up hardware components &#8211; there&#8217;s also software that needs to be taken care of. In this case, the author is weighing several real-time operating systems for use in the project, namely FreeRTOS, NuttX, and Zephyr. If you&#8217;re working on a similar project, this article may help in choosing the RTOS that&#8217;s right for you.

I hear that cancelling a NYT subscription is wicked hard. That <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/04/bullshit2.m4a">alone</a> makes me feel like cancelling. I cancelled their morning email of things I need to know about. It's one thing for them to exclusively report on Biden's age in their space, but my mailbox is mine. Get the F out of my mailbox.

This year I'm thinking how we can boot up a source of news that has the balance we deserve. Now that the Supreme Court is no longer keeping up any pretense of respecting the Constitution, and journalism is either colluding, or preparing for their meeting with a military tribunal in March next year, followed by, if lucky, a re-education camp, we need help knowing what's real and what's <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/04/bullshit2.m4a">not</a>.

## P&B: Anton Podviaznikov

date: 2024-07-05, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>This is the 45th edition of <em>People and Blogs</em>, the series where I ask interesting people to talk about themselves and their blogs. Today we have Anton Podviaznikov and his blog, <a href="https://podviaznikov.com">podviaznikov.com</a></p>

You can read the interviews here on the blog or you can subscribe to the <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/feed">RSS feed</a>.</p>

<hr />
<h2>Let's start from the basics: can you introduce yourself?</h2>
<p>I’m originally from Ukraine, I grew up there and finished university. Moved out in 2010 to explore the world. Since 2014 US was my home base.</p>
<p>I’m software engineer by trade. It was my education and first I worked as a programmer because it was my career choice. But sometime around 2011 I fell in love with the web and programming. I worked at several startups and few bigger tech companies and also created countless side projects.</p>
<h2>What's the story behind your blog?</h2>
<p>I created my personal site around 2013. It is 10+ years old. I think I created it during the period when I was falling in love with programming and ideas behind web and the Internet. I got exposed to them way later in my life than people who grew up in Western Europe or US. I had a lot of personal revelations at that time in my life.</p>
<h2>What does your creative process look like when it comes to blogging?</h2>
<p>Super simple. I discovered that writing feels “painful” for me. I really do struggle. The only way that works for me is to remove editing part and also write in the “stream of consciousness style”. I write stuff in one go. I write some essay in Apple Notes and it gets published automatically to my site while I’m writing it. I might reread it some time later and edit few things - but usually I don’t do that and just discover some typos years later.</p>
<p>Another important thing is that I mostly write on topics I don’t want to think anymore. Writing is the final step of thinking over something for me. I write down about some topic, publish it and then don’t think about that again for a while.</p>
<h2>Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe the physical space influences your creativity?</h2>
<p>I wrote decent amount of essays on airplanes and trains. They are uncomfortable physically, but I found them to be a great time to write and to speed up the travel, Internet is flaky and I have space to reflect. I also like to write(and program) in coffeeshops. I like noise and I can usually fully block it out.</p>
<h2>A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your tech stack?</h2>
<p>I’m software engineer. I always made custom stacks for my personal site. For the past 2 years my website is powered by a small tool I made. It’s a tool that publishes Apple Notes to my site. It’s called Montaigne.</p>
<h2>Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would you do anything differently?</h2>
<p>I want to say: start even earlier. But that is also difficult because I do feel that I didn’t have much to say before I was 25 yo and also I didn’t discover my “voice”. But I think trying writing helps to discover that voice.</p>
<p>Write as often as you can. If it’s 5 essays per year - it’s still good. I collected many over the years and sometimes I open some and read and get surprised with some insights I got. It’s a very interesting feeling. </p>
<p>I feel like even now I don’t capture most of the insights I have during the year. So writing more is always a good advice.</p>
<h2>Financial question since the web is obsessed with money: how much does it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost or does it generate some revenue? And what's your position on people monetising personal blogs?</h2>
<p>I think people should do what they feel is good for them. If you are in the position where you want/need to monetize - do that. If money is not critical, do not do it. Eg write for yourself first. On top of that there might be some second order unpredictable benefits to writing. Eg someone would reach out to you and would offer a job or collaboration. This is way better than money(if you don’t need them).</p>
<p>Hard to say how much does it cost to run my site since it runs using the tool that I made. But for other people this tool is free:)</p>
<h2>Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth checking out? And also, who do you think I should be interviewing next?</h2>

## David Rosenthal on the X Windowing System’s 40th birthday

date: 2024-07-04, from: OS News

David Rosenthal, one of the primary contributors to the X Windowing System, has published an awesome blog post about the recent 40 year anniversary of X, full of details about the early days of X development, as well as the limitations they had to deal with, the choices they had to make, and the environment in which they were constrained. Once at Sun I realized that it was more important for the company that the Unix world standardized on a single window system than that the standard be Sun&#8217;s NeWS system. At C-MU I had already looked into X as an alternative to the Andrew window system, so I knew it was the obvious alternative to NeWS. Although most of my time was spent developing NeWS, I rapidly ported X version 10 to the Sun/1, likely the second port to non-DEC hardware. It worked, but I had to kludge several areas that depended on DEC-specific hardware. The worst was the completely DEC-specific keyboard support. Because it was clear that a major redesign of X was needed to make it portable and in particular to make it work well on Sun hardware, Gosling and I worked with the teams at DEC SRC and WRL on the design of X version 11. Gosling provided significant input on the imaging model, and I designed the keyboard support. As the implementation evolved I maintained the Sun port and did a lot of testing and bug fixing. All of which led to my trip to Boston to pull all-nighters at MIT finalizing the release. ↫ David Rosenthal They were clearly right. During those days, the UNIX world was using a variety of windowing systems, all tied to various companies and platforms. Standardising virtually the entire UNIX world on X aided in keeping UNIX compatible-ish even in the then-new graphical era, and X&#8217;s enduring existence to this very day is evidence of the fact they made a lot of right choices early on. Rosenthal also explains why one of the main alternatives to X, Sun&#8217;s PostScript-based NeWS, which was also co-developed by Rosenthal, didn&#8217;t win out over X. It had several things working against its adoptions and popularisation, such as Sun requiring a license fee for the source code, its heftier system requirements, and the fact it was more difficult to program for. After trying to create what Rosenthal describes as a &#8220;ghastly kludge&#8221; by combining NeWS and X into Xnews, Sun eventually killed it altogether. Of course, this wouldn&#8217;t be restrospective of X without mentioning Wayland. We and Jobs were wrong about the imaging model, for at least two reasons. First, early on pixels were in short supply and applications needed to make the best use of the few they were assigned. They didn&#8217;t want to delegate control to the PostScript interpreter. Second, later on came GPUs with 3D imaging models. The idea of a one-size-fits-all model became obsolete. The reason that Wayland should replace X11 is that it is agnostic to the application&#8217;s choice of imaging model. ↫ David Rosenthal This is about as close to a blessing from the original X Windowing System developers you&#8217;re ever going to get, but Rosenthal does correctly note that XWayland is a thing, and since not every application is going to be rewritten to support Wayland, X will most likely be around for a long time to come. In fact, he looks towards the future, and predicts that we&#8217;ll definitely be celebrating 50 years of X, and that yes, people will still be using it by then.

## Cloudflare lets customers block AI bots, scrapers and crawlers with a single click

date: 2024-07-04, from: OS News

It seems the dislike for machine learning runs deep. In a blog post, Cloudflare has announced that blocking machine learning scrapers is so popular, they decided to just add a feature to the Cloudflare dashboard that will block all machine learning scrapers with a single click. We hear clearly that customers don’t want AI bots visiting their websites, and especially those that do so dishonestly. To help, we’ve added a brand new one-click to block all AI bots. It’s available for all customers, including those on the free tier. To enable it, simply navigate to the Security > Bots section of the Cloudflare dashboard, and click the toggle labeled AI Scrapers and Crawlers. ↫ Cloudflare blog According to Cloudflare, 85% of their customers block machine learning scrapers from taking content from their websites, and that number definitely does not surprise me. People clearly understand that multibillion dollar megacorporations freely scraping every piece of content on the web for their own further obscene enrichment while giving nothing back &#8211; in fact, while charging us for it &#8211; is inherently wrong, and as such, they choose to block them from doing so. Of course, it makes sense for Cloudflare to try and combat junk traffic, so this is one of those cases where the corporate interests of Cloudflare actually line up with the personal interests of its customers, so making blocking machine learning scrapers as easy as possible benefits both parties. I think OSNews, too, makes use of Cloudflare, so I&#8217;m definitely going to ask OSNews&#8217; owner to hit that button. Cloudflare further details that a lot of people are blocking crawlers run by companies like Amazon, Google, and OpenAI, but completely miss far more active crawlers like those run by the Chinese company ByteDance, probably because those companies don&#8217;t dominate the &#8220;AI&#8221; news cycle. Then there&#8217;s the massive number of machine learning crawlers that just straight-up lie about their intentions, trying to hide the fact they&#8217;re machine learning bots. We fear that some AI companies intent on circumventing rules to access content will persistently adapt to evade bot detection. We will continue to keep watch and add more bot blocks to our AI Scrapers and Crawlers rule and evolve our machine learning models to help keep the Internet a place where content creators can thrive and keep full control over which models their content is used to train or run inference on. ↫ Cloudflare blog I find this particularly funny because what&#8217;s happening here is machine learning models being used to block&#8230; Machine learning models. Give it a few more years down the trajectory we&#8217;re currently on, and the internet will just be bots reading content posted by other bots.

## Some sanity for C and C++ development on Windows

date: 2024-07-04, from: OS News

The article&#8217;s from 2021, but I think it&#8217;s still worth discussing. A hard reality of C and C++ software development on Windows is that there has never been a good, native C or C++ standard library implementation for the platform. A standard library should abstract over the underlying host facilities in order to ease portable software development. On Windows, C and C++ is so poorly hooked up to operating system interfaces that most portable or mostly-portable software — programs which work perfectly elsewhere — are subtly broken on Windows, particularly outside of the English-speaking world. The reasons are almost certainly political, originally motivated by vendor lock-in, than technical, which adds insult to injury. This article is about what’s wrong, how it’s wrong, and some easy techniques to deal with it in portable software. ↫ Chris Wellons As someone who doesn&#8217;t know how to code or program, articles like these are always difficult to properly parse. I understand the primary problem the article covers, but what I&#8217;m curious about is how much of this problem is personal &#8211; skill issue &#8211; and how much of it is a widely held belief by Windows developers and programmers.

## 2024-07-02 The importance of moderation

date: 2024-07-04, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-07-02-the-importance-of-moderation">2024-07-02 The importance of moderation</h1>

<p><a class="account" href="https://idiomdrottning.org/users/Sandra" title="@Sandra@idiomdrottning.org">@Sandra</a> recently wrote <a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/usenet">Usenet had to die</a>, arguing that Usenet was wasteful, everybody carrying a copy of everybody else, including spam and binaries.
I agree with all the points made. The idea that there is one global network of groups, with everybody carrying all the groups and everybody being allowed to post led to the downfall of Usenet.</p>

<p>Having recently hooked my laptop and server server to a handful of other servers using UUCP, NNCP and NNTP for file copies, mail and news, I just want to emphasize that the same technology can be used to build a different net.</p>

<ul>
<li>UUCP doesn&rsquo;t have to be anonymous. Calling systems can be required to have a username and password.</li>
<li>NNTP doesn&rsquo;t have to be anonymous. Systems can be known peers based on IP numbers and users can be required to authenticate themselves.</li>
<li>Servers don&rsquo;t have to mirror all the groups. Systems can be selective in what they accept and in what they pass on.</li>
</ul>

<p>The spam problem arises when two systems &ldquo;trust&rdquo; each other and peer messages but one of the systems doesn&rsquo;t act on abuse and moderation reports.
Perhaps Usenet generated too much of a workload for system administrators so they stopped following up on those reports.
Perhaps some servers had become too big to ban.</p>

<p>I think we have the exact same problems with fedi.
Some instances seem too big to defederate from.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, individual blocking doesn&rsquo;t work.
If my posts end up on an unmoderated server because somebody I like is following me, the post shows up in the federated feed on that server and all the other users that I don&rsquo;t like can comment and those comments are sent back to me.
I can block them all individually or block the large instance including my small number of friends.
That instance has become too big to ban.</p>

<p>To come back to net news:
From my point of view, the protocols are not to blame for the downfall of Usenet.
It was the lack of moderation that killed Usenet.
It was the ease of setting up web forums and being able to moderate them that made Usenet irrelevant.
In the end, to all these people federation was not as important as moderation.</p>

<p>Administrators were unwilling to drop the groups that were overrun with people that needed moderation.
This is a problem on all platforms with groups, e.g. Reddit.</p>

<p>Administrators were unwilling to ban the instances that didn&rsquo;t moderate their users.
This is a problem on all federated platforms, e.g. Mail.</p>

<p>Administrators were unwilling to create new groups for people in their niches.
At least nobody seems to be making that mistake again.
IRC, Reddit, Discord – they all demonstrated that ad-hoc group formation and self-moderation was viable.</p>

<p>This is why I think moderation, group forming and selectivity of federation are the most important quality of a platform.</p>

<p>We can have a small network of servers offering mail and news exchange, like in the old days.
The problem is unmoderated growth.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Social_Media">#Social Media</a></p>

<p><strong>2024-07-04</strong>. I got a long reply by <a class="account" href="https://idiomdrottning.org/users/Sandra" title="@Sandra@idiomdrottning.org">@Sandra</a>, reproduced in its entirety below.</p>

<div style="text-align:center">⁂</div>

<p>Ah, that&rsquo;s not a super new post, it&rsquo;s from September 2023. I dug it
out again since we were talking about Illuminant, which seems awesome.
It uses hashtags only as post keywords and instead, if I understand
things correctly, relies on FEP-1b12 to provide group support.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think we have the exact same problems with fedi. Some instances

</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s not quite the same thing.</p>

<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s a bad thing that I&rsquo;ve being hesitant to defederate from
m.soc even though I get more spam from it over Fedi than I&rsquo;ve been
getting from email fro the past several years.</p>

<p>But I&rsquo;m still only getting individual posts from m.soc or any other
server. (Which is also why hashtags don&rsquo;t work the way people think.)</p>

<p>On Usenet, the typical behavior would be to carry the whole thing.
Currently, I get dozens of spam messages from m.soc. If I were to
mirror the whole thing (which is possible with AP relays, and is what
would be necessary for hashtags to work like channels, me mirroring
the entirety of all the non-banned servers), I&rsquo;d have to deal with
thousands of messages. My server would croak.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, individual blocking doesn’t work. If my posts end up
on an unmoderated server because somebody I like is following me,
the post shows up in the federated feed on that server and all the
other users that I don’t like can comment and those comments are
sent back to me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A problem. But again something that was way worse with usenet because
on there, not only would I mirror or moderate abusive replies to me. I
had to mirror abusive replies to <em>everybody</em>.</p>

<p>BTW, I&rsquo;m, for the most part, glad that the servers-that-can-comment
aren&rsquo;t allowlisted, that it works like email, that I can get comments
from anyone. The downside of that is having to ban ban ban like crazy,
but if it didn&rsquo;t work like that I&rsquo;m not sure it even would be
federated.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can block them all individually or block the large instance
including my small number of friends. That instance has become too
big to ban.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A problem. But on Usenet, <em>every</em> instance was too big to ban since
every instance was expected to carry everything.</p>

<p>Individual blocks is one way around it. That&rsquo;s why I, a small instance
op, while I&rsquo;ve banned many small mainly-abuse instances, my need to
ban the big sloppily moderated silos like m.soc or threads is a li&rsquo;l
lower since I don&rsquo;t have hundreds of users to protect, which a midsize
instance would have. I can absolutely see why midsize &ldquo;safe space&rdquo;
instances would ban m.soc for example.</p>

<p>Also I &ldquo;silence&rdquo; every instance since I don&rsquo;t have a &ldquo;whole known
network&rdquo; tab.</p>

<p>Killfiles was a user-level way to mute users on newsgroups. So there
was <em>some</em> mitigation, but Fedi additionally has several other
moderation tools like instance bans or silencing.</p>

<p>More fundamentally: ActivityPub is about sending individual posts.
Usenet was about mirroring entire servers. Those two are not the same.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To come back to net news: From my point of view, the protocols are
not to blame for the downfall of Usenet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The context that I wrote that Usenet post last September was to rant
about hashtags. (A topic that I&rsquo;m gonna return to every now and then
until the group/tag situation gets a li&rsquo;l better, which might require
new UX affordances or perhaps only education.)</p>

<p>That problem, summarized:</p>

<ul>
<li>Servers can only show you the posts that it has already stumbled
over, through following or commenting</li>
<li>So when you browse a hashtag, you only see a very small subset of
those posts</li>
<li>Which is fine for organizing a handful of persons posts, like &ldquo;I
wanna see all of Marie&rsquo;s <code>#tidying</code> posts&rdquo; or &ldquo;I wanna go back and
take a look at all of my already-followed-friends <code>#mosstodon</code>
posts&rdquo; or even for filtering out stuff. I.e. it&rsquo;s OK as a tool for
<em>subsets</em> and <em>intersection</em></li>
<li>It&rsquo;s a disaster for <em>union</em>, for discovery, for &ldquo;emulating channels&rdquo;
which people are used to from Tumblr and Twitter, which worked there
since those are centralized</li>
<li>For hashtags to work the way people expect them to, servers would
have to mirror all posts. Like on Usenet.</li>
<li>There was an effort in that direction early on, with the &ldquo;relay&rdquo;
system.</li>
<li>But small servers would croak. <strong>That&rsquo;s</strong> the problem. It&rsquo;d be an
environmental waste heap.</li>
</ul>

<p>And that&rsquo;s absolutely a protocol level problem!</p>

<p>A protocol level problem that Usenet had even without hashtags. (Well,
there was one hashtag: Kibo.)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve said a couple of times that servers mirror each other and for the
sticklers in the audience I&rsquo;ve got to add that not literally <em>every</em>
server carried <em>every</em> group. For example, some didn&rsquo;t carry
Anarchists Lunatics Terrorists a.k.a. the <code>alt</code> hierarchy. But that&rsquo;s
the fundamental intended flow. Group mirroring.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f4/Usenet_servers_and_clients.svg" alt="Usenet
architecture" /></p>

<p>So in that way, Usenet is unlike mailing lists, where individual
messages are sent to individual users. FEP-1b12 group servers on Fedi
(like PieFed and MBin) are awesome because they get the best of both
worlds of the &ldquo;only send the relevant posts&rdquo; nature of mailing lists,
and the &ldquo;we&rsquo;re hosting this post anyway so we only need to store it
once in the SQL&rdquo; nature of Usenet. As long as one user on a Lemmy
server is subscribed to <code>@garderning@foo.bar</code>, like an email user
might be subscribed to a mailing list, it might-as-well display a copy
of that group since it&rsquo;s getting those messages anyway. It&rsquo;s not
perfect and we&rsquo;re still paying a hefty &ldquo;decentralization tax&rdquo;, but
it&rsquo;s more robust than mail and news.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It was the lack of moderation that killed Usenet. It was the ease of
setting up web forums and being able to moderate them that made
Usenet irrelevant.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Naw, Usenet kept puttering along after that, for a while, until the
cost (and legal danger) of mirroring huge binaries archives which was
the nail of nails. And that was a protocol level issue.</p>

<p>Fedi absolutely has a moderation problem. That is being addressed although it seems to me that there are still unsolved problems.<br>
Usenet had a much bigger moderation problem and much of the reason for
that was on the protocol level. We have instances and instance bans to
help moderate clusters of users where each instance op helps moderate
the users on their instance. Moderation is happening on a user level
which makes much more sense than on a group level. (Someone can be a
saint on <code>alt.suicide.holiday</code> but a jerk on
<code>alt.swedish.chef.bork.bork.bork</code> for example.)</p>

<p>But Usenet also has a scalability problem. Resource use. Better
moderation wouldn&rsquo;t be nearly enough to fix that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Administrators were unwilling to ban the instances that didn’t
moderate their users. This is a problem on all federated platforms,
e.g. Mail.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Email can&rsquo;t moderate their users since email isn&rsquo;t supposed to be
world-readable. (With exceptions like mailing lists; we can ban
someone who sends abusive messages to those.) But even so, instance
banning is very common on email.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We can have a small network of servers offering mail and news
exchange, like in the old days. The problem is unmoderated growth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Last time I talked about this I got the world&rsquo;s most stubborn reply
guy on my neck who (since he was on a huge instance) could use
hashtags to find at least some amount of interesting posts and was
resistant to change. Since I mentioned scalability issues and how my
server would croak if it were to try to mirror even <em>one</em> of the big
instances, he started going on and on about &ldquo;scalability is only for
capitalists&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Yet another case of Smolnet Wishful Thinking Syndrome. The kind of
thinking that hates Eternal September more than anything but keeps
designing protocols that lead to more Eternal Septembers since they&rsquo;re
about everyone-seeing-everyone and then they resort to technical
gatekeeping or even bullying to keep people out. Not into it.</p>

<p>My criticism of Usenet&rsquo;s protocol here has nothing to do with
capitalist scaling, which is about &ldquo;throwing computers at it&rdquo;. Sure,
that&rsquo;d be one solution to the protocol problems inherent to Usenet and
relay-laden-ActivityPub.</p>

<p>Real Smolnet scaling is about designing protocols that are about
connecting people to people (and to topic groups or other
communities), and in a non-wasteful, mottainai way create small
overlapping villages instead of one big shout-loud-and-go-viral
channel.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of protocols. Those where everyone must see
everything (like Antenna and CAPCOM, and Twitter), and those where
that&rsquo;s not the case (like ActivityPub and email).</p>

<p>Here are three network layouts:</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://ellen.idiomdrottning.org/baran_networks.png" alt="Baran networks" /></p>

<p>First we have a centralized network. One hub server and then every
client is a spoke connected to that center core. The most efficient
way to organize an &ldquo;everyone-must-see-everything&rdquo; protocol, but
vulnerable to disasters like meteor strikes, nuclear explosions,
billionaire takeovers, or earthquakes.</p>

<p>Then we have a decentralized network. Several hubs connected to each
other, mirroring each other. Usenet worked like that. The hubs need to
be just as beefy as the ones in a centralized network. This has some
advantages like redundancy and robustnesss, and it&rsquo;s more politically
appealing to the anarchists that built the internet. (Not sure why
since there&rsquo;s still two tiers and a mod group that rules everything
for everyone.) It can be wasteful. It can handle
everyone-must-see-everything protocols. It can also really shine when
everyone <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em> need to see everything, like IRC which is super
efficient. IRC is a brilliant protocol design that, like a mailing
list, only sends the messages to a server that that server needs.</p>

<p>Finally we have a distributed network. No hubs. It looks more like a
mesh where every machine is connected to only a handful of &ldquo;nearby&rdquo;
machines. This type of network is an absolute disaster for the
everyone-must-see-everything scenario! Redundant to the point of
wastefulness. That&rsquo;s a future we must fight tooth and nail! And that&rsquo;s
exactly where the relay-centered version of ActivityPub was headed,
and that&rsquo;s what would be &ldquo;needed&rdquo; for hashtags-as-groups-and-discovery
to &ldquo;work&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s where we the grassroots federalized ancom degrowth community
need to check ourselves before we wreck ourselves because even though
<a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/energy-is-undercosted" title="Energy is undercosted">energy and e-waste is underpriced</a>, a capitalist for-profit silo
company would never in a million years set up a system like this
because it&rsquo;s too wasteful ever for them, while we&rsquo;re liable to do so
since each instance op only sees their <em>own</em> costs, not the cost for
the network as a whole. The megacorps are OK with centralization
because for them, the power consolidation in the first two network
types is a positive, while for us it&rsquo;s a huge negative so we&rsquo;re drawn
to the third type, so we need to be really careful and really
responsible here.</p>

<p>But as bad as this layout is for everyone-must-see-everything, it&rsquo;s
really awesome for protocols where everyone <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em> need to see
everything. It&rsquo;s economical, robust, cozy. ActivityPub (without the
relentless mirroring) is a good fit here. I can follow a handful of
users and be connected to their instances and only their posts are
sent to my instance, I don&rsquo;t mirror the entire server. It&rsquo;s actually
pretty awesome! It&rsquo;s good for moderation too because I only need to
moderate my &ldquo;neighborhood&rdquo;. Yeah, a &ldquo;neighborhood&rdquo; is the perfect
analogy for this; neighborhoods that can and overlap but are still
small and managed. A system set up like that can remain smol and cozy
even as it invites everyone on Earth. It&rsquo;s great. ActivityPub is
awesome.</p>

## Redox secures more funding deals, gives UI small makeover, and more

date: 2024-07-03, from: OS News

Another month, another report from the Redox team. The Rust-based operating system saw another active month, including getting a whole bunch of new funding deals for specific features, such as adding UNIX-style signals to Redox, as well as the further development of Termion, a Redox project that is &#8220;a pure Rust, bindless library for low-level handling, manipulating and reading information about terminals&#8221;. Furthermore, the default user interface Orbital got a small makeover with new colours and a new default wallpaper, and there&#8217;s the usual documentation and website improvements. More substantial are doubling the performance of RedoxFS by improving the speed of block reads and writes, and changes in how the xHCI drivers works to drastically reduce CPU usage. The PCI/PCIe and x86 VirtIO drivers has also been improved, and you can now do userspace debugging using the GNU Debugger from outside the VM. There&#8217;s a lot more, so head on over to read the whole thing.

## How dot matrix printers created text

date: 2024-07-03, from: OS News

The impact printer was a mainstay of the early desktop computing era. Also called “dot matrix printers,” these printers could print low-resolution yet very readable text on a page, and do so quickly and at a low price point. But these printers are a relic of the past; in 2024, you might find them printing invoices or shipping labels, although more frequently these use cases have been replaced by other types of printers such as thermal printers and laser printers.  The heart of the impact printer is the print head. The print head contained a column of pins (9 pins was common) that moved across the page. Software in the printer controlled when to strike these pins through an inked ribbon to place a series of “dots” on a page. By carefully timing the pin strikes with the movement of the print head, the printer could control where each dot was placed. A column of dots might represent the vertical stroke of the letter H, a series of single dots created the horizontal bar, and another column would create the final vertical stroke. ↫ Jim Hall at Technically We Write Our first printer was a dot matrix model, from I think a brand called Star or something similar. Back then, in 1991 or so, a lot of employers in The Netherlands offered programs wherein employees could buy computers through their work, offered at a certain discount. My parents jumped on the opportunity when my mom&#8217;s employer offered such a program, and through it, we bought a brand new 286 machine running MS-DOS and Windows 3.0, and it included said dot matrix printer. There&#8217;s something about the sound and workings of a dot matrix printer that just can&#8217;t be bested by modern ink, laser, or LED printers. The mechanical punching, at such a fast rate it sounded like a tiny Gatling gun, was mesmerising, especially when paired with continuous form paper. Carefully ripping off the perforated edges of the paper after printing was just a nice bonus that entertained me quite a bit as a child. I was surprised to learn that dot matrix printers are still being manufactured and sold today, and even comes in colour. They&#8217;re quite a bit more expensive than other printer types these days, but I have a feeling they&#8217;re aimed at enterprises and certain niches, which probably means they&#8217;re going to be of considerably higher quality than all the other junk printers that clog the market. With a bit more research, it might actually be possible to find a brand new colour dot matrix printer that is a better choice than some of the modern alternatives. The fact that I&#8217;m not contemplating buying a brand new dot matrix printer in 2024, even though I rarely print, is a mildly worrying development.

## An unexpected journey into Microsoft Defender’s signature world

date: 2024-07-03, from: OS News

Microsoft Defender is the endpoint security solution preinstalled on every Windows machine since Windows 7. It&#8217;s a fairly complex piece of software, addressing both EDR and EPP use cases. As such, Microsoft markets two different products. Microsoft Defender for Endpoint is a cloud based endpoint security solution that combines sensor capabilities with the advantages of a cloud processing. Microsoft Defender Antivirus (MDA), on the other hand, is a modern EPP enabled by default on any fresh Windows installation. MDA is the focus of this analysis. ↫ Retooling If you&#8217;ve ever wanted to know how Microsoft Defender works, this article contains a wealth of detailed information.

## Stubs

date: 2024-07-03, from: Rachel Kwon blog

An interesting blog post. I liked this note about trees in Johannesburg by Herman. In our last apartment, the bedroom faced a quiet tree-filled backyard despite the apartment itself being on a major two-way avenue, so I woke up to birds chirping and almost non-existent street noise, and a view of lush greenery. In our current apartment, the bedroom faces a brick wall and a one-way side street adjacent to a one-way main street, so now I have a classic New York wakeup call which is horns honking, garbage trucks rattling, pigeons cooing and flapping, and occasionally people walking.

## R9OS: Plan 9 in Rust

date: 2024-07-03, from: OS News

R9 is a work-in-progress effort to build a Plan 9 kernel to Rust. It was started a couple years back by the maintainers of the Harvey OS distribution of Plan 9, who threw in the towel after &#8220;loss of traction&#8221;. R9 is a reimplementation of the plan9 kernel in Rust. It is not only inspired by but in many ways derived from the original Plan 9 source code. ↫ R9OS GitHub page For now, the project is obviously mostly focused on running in virtual machines, specifically Qemu, in which it can be run using a variety of architectures: aarch64, x86-64 (with or without kvm), and RISC-V.

## 2024-07-02 SSH hardening

date: 2024-07-02, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-07-02-ssh-hardening">2024-07-02 SSH hardening</h1>

<p>Today I decided to harden my SSH server configuration and did the one thing you should never do: I logged out before testing the new configuration and promptly locked myself.
Don&rsquo;t be like me.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what I wanted to do: Positron Security&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.sshaudit.com/">SSH Configuration Auditor</a> gave me a B+ grade and there were <a href="https://www.sshaudit.com/hardening_guides.html#debian_12">some suggestions</a>. I had already implemented some of them because a long time ago I had followed <a href="https://disknotifier.com/blog/simple-ssh-security/">a different SSH hardening guide</a>.</p>

<p>The thing that broke my setup is that the new hardening guide specified the following:</p>

<pre><code>RequiredRSASize 3072
</code></pre>

<p>The effect was that I could no longer log in:</p>

<pre><code>alex@alexschroeder.ch: Permission denied (publickey).
</code></pre>

<p>That&rsquo;s because I have passwords disabled. You can only get in via public key. And my public key wasn&rsquo;t good enough: it has 2048 bits:</p>

<pre><code>ssh-keygen -lf .ssh/id_rsa
2048 SHA256:************/****************************** alex@Megabombus.local (RSA)
</code></pre>

<p>So what I had to do:</p>

<ul>
<li>Visit the hosting provider&rsquo;s website</li>
<li>Enable VNC</li>
<li>Open a &ldquo;NoVNC&rdquo; window</li>
<li>Enable login using passwords without having access to Shift or Control keys (wtf?)</li>
</ul>

<p>That meant commenting these two in <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code>:</p>

<pre><code>PermitRootLogin prohibit-password
PasswordAuthentication no
</code></pre>

<p>Restarted <code>sshd</code> on the server:</p>

<pre><code>systemctl restart sshd
</code></pre>

<p>I already had an <code>ed25519</code> identity:</p>

<pre><code>ls .ssh/id* 
.ssh/id_ed25519  .ssh/id_ed25519.pub  .ssh/id_rsa  .ssh/id_rsa.pub
</code></pre>

<p>I probably created them using the following:</p>

<pre><code>ssh-keygen -t ed25519
</code></pre>

<p>I used <code>ssh-copy</code> to copy them to the server:</p>

<pre><code>ssh-copy-id -i .ssh/id_ed25519 sibirocobombus
</code></pre>

<p>And I added the correct setting to my <code>.ssh/config</code>:</p>

<pre><code>Host sibirocobombus
  HostName alexschroeder.ch
  Port 882
  User alex
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
</code></pre>

<p>I use the <code>ssh</code> config file all the time!</p>

<p>This allowed me to uncomment these two in <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> again:</p>

<pre><code>PermitRootLogin prohibit-password
PasswordAuthentication no
</code></pre>

<p>I restarted <code>sshd</code> on the server:</p>

<pre><code>systemctl restart sshd
</code></pre>

<p>Note to self: Should I ever need to check the server fingerprints, see <a href="ssh">ssh</a>.</p>

<p>My <code>git</code> server needed the same public key in <code>/home/git/.ssh/authorized_keys</code>.</p>

I decided to give it a try. I had a can at lunch and it's weird but okay I guess, but the belches are strongly flavored and that's <i>realllly</i> weird. It took me a while to figure out where this <a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a32925734/why-do-my-burps-smell/">belch-breath</a> was coming from. It tastes like I took some very strong medicine. The weirdest soft drink I've ever had. But it kind of grows on you. I'll try another one and let you know how it goes.

## A two-podcast Tuesday

date: 2024-07-02, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/02/twoPodcastTuesdayPodcastPart1.m4a">This</a> is the first of <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/02/193103.html">two</a> podcasts for today. </p>
<p>It started out being one podcast, but I hit the wrong button after 14 minutes and ended up with two audio files instead of one.</p>
<p>I don't like editing, so you get two for the price of one. :-)</p>
<p>It's a rambler, starts out with me talking about <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Allow-Me-Retort-Black-Constitution/dp/1620976811">Elie Mystal</a> on abortion and slavery. </p>
<p>The second podcast explains how we're in a war, and it's about time we recognized it as such. </p>
<p>We need the Democrats to do what we elected them to do, save the freaking United States, which by the way after yesterday's decision by the Supreme Court, doesn't really exist any longer. We go into that in the second episode. </p>
<p>It's not enough to win the election. We have to get the Supreme Court back to a semblance of what it was. They're behaving in a way that's inconsistent with the continued existence of the country they're supposed to be part of the government of. </p>

## European Commission shoots down Facebook’s “pay or consent” model

date: 2024-07-02, from: OS News

The European Union&#8217;s Digital Markets Act is the gift that keeps on giving. This time, it&#8217;s Facebook&#8217;s turn to be slapped on the fingers with a ruler &#8211; a metric ruler, of course &#8211; because of its malicious compliance with the DMA. Today, the Commission has informed Meta of its preliminary findings that its “pay or consent” advertising model fails to comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA). In the Commission&#8217;s preliminary view, this binary choice forces users to consent to the combination of their personal data and fails to provide them a less personalised but equivalent version of Meta&#8217;s social networks. ↫ European Commission press release The European Commission&#8217;s preliminary conclusion takes issue with Facebook&#8217;s binary choice between &#8220;pay for zero ads&#8221; and &#8220;full-on tracking and all the ads&#8221;. According to the DMA, Facebook must offer users the option of an equivalent experience with less tracking, and the company doesn&#8217;t offer such an option to users. In addition, Facebook&#8217;s proposal does not allow users to &#8220;exercise their right to freely consent to the combination of their personal data&#8221;. It&#8217;s important to note that this is not some sort of definitive ruling of finding; it&#8217;s preliminary, and Facebook now has the opportunity to state its case and formulate its arguments. If the eventual ruling is that Facebook does not comply, the company is liable for fines up to 10% of its yearly worldwide turnover, which can rise up to 20% for repeated infractions.

## Installing Ansible on a RISC-V computer

<span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Installing Ansible on a RISC-V computer</span>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Ansible runs on Python, and Python runs on... well pretty much <em>everything</em>. Including newer RISC-V machines.</p>

<p>But Ansible has a lot of dependencies, and some of these dependencies have caused frustration from time to time on x86 and Arm (so having issues with a dependency is just a way of life when you enter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell">dependency hell</a>)... but in this case, for the past few months, I've never had luck installing Ansible from PyPI (Python's Package Index) on any RISC-V system, using <code>pip install ansible</code>.</p>

<p>I prefer installing this way (rather than compiling from source or from system packages) because it generally gets the latest version of Ansible, with an easy upgrade/downgrade path. It's also easy to add <code>ansible</code> to a Python <code>requirements.txt</code> file and install it alongside other package dependencies.</p>

<p>Regardless, the <code>cryptography</code> library, which requires a Rust compiler to build if the package is not already built for a particular system, has made it difficult to install Ansible from <code>pip</code>:</p></div>

<li>Nominate six replacements, sorry no Repubs this time.</li>

## 2024-06-28 Biden

date: 2024-07-02, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-06-28-biden">2024-06-28 Biden</h1>

<p>When I see all this talk about Biden and the US elections I keep thinking: almost all that matters is that Biden has a vice president that can take over as soon as things break down. I still remember thinking when Biden got elected: this guy has nothing; he is the most boring and conflict averse choice. And this was exactly what the US needed. And it’s what the US still needs. A boring candidate whose administration gets stuff done.</p>

<p>Of course, the US also needs a lot of other things: reforms, policy changes, and on and on. And you can have both! Do not vote for the fascist and keep the criticism up. So I can say: racism, Israel, Ukraine, immigration, gerrymandering, gun control, Snowden… work on all these things!! Do it! But just because I’m unhappy about the lack of progress does not mean you should abstain or vote for a fascist.</p>

<p>The fact that both candidates are old white men is a shame, yes of course! But it is not a reason to hand power to the fascists.</p>

<p>And often things can get done at the local level. The Swiss based their constitution on the US constitution (senate, congress, states, federalism) and I know that what is impossible to achieve at the national level can sometimes be achieved at the state level, and what cannot be achieved at the state level can be achieved at the city level, in the community, in the library, at the bar, at home.</p>

<p>Wherever things are not first past the post you can kick Democrats where it hurts and beat them. And then, perhaps, one day, things will get better.</p>

<p>Then again, here in Switzerland percentages go up and down here and there and yet one feels that nothing really changes. It’s hard and people aren’t as social I would prefer them to be.</p>

<p>I do like flowers and trees and birds and amphibians and bees and ants and marine mammals and bison and many other things, though. The help me through the dark times.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23USA">#USA</a></p>

<p><strong>2024-07-02</strong>. I found following <a class="account" href="https://hachyderm.io/@mekkaokereke" title="@mekkaokereke@hachyderm.io">@mekkaokereke</a> eye to be quite interesting.
He says stuff like the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A quote from the Biden Trump debate. Which candidate said this, Trump or Biden?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I put more – we put more police on the street than any administration has. He wants to cut the cops.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As a reminder, Biden is the candidate that needs more Black men to vote for him, or he is likely to lose the election.</p>

<p>As a reminder, Biden is the one that pushed for and passed the 80s crime bill.</p>

<p>As a reminder, Biden is the one that instructed cities to transfer ~$1B of Covid relief funds to police budgets.</p>

<p>Y&rsquo;all are betting the future of the free world on Biden being able to say and do stuff like this, and then still get 95% of the votes of Black men? Seriously? That&rsquo;s the strategy?</p>

<p>Man, lemme go ahead and prepare for this next Trump term then, because that strategy is awful.</p>

<p>How did y&rsquo;all ever think that would work?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note how he isn&rsquo;t in favour of Trump.
But he sure isn&rsquo;t in favour of Biden, either.
The message that I&rsquo;m hearing: Democrats, do better!
And by &ldquo;do better&rdquo;, I mean: Do better for the constituents that you expect to vote for you.</p>

<p>This is what all the austerity has led to:
People hate the current government and don&rsquo;t see anybody else to trust and vote for.</p>

<p>This is not about poor misguided undesirables voting for Trump.
This is about the Democrats not doing enough for the people that aren&rsquo;t voting.</p>

## Shared reality

date: 2024-07-02, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>Online interactions are weirdly unique. They happen in shared, digital spaces—forums, chats, comment sections, social media platforms—where it’s easy to forget that more often than not, the people interacting with each other don’t share the same day-to-day reality. And sometimes that doesn’t matter. There are plenty of topics we can chat about that don’t have a connection with our lives. But there are also plenty who do have a connection and a profound one. From food to politics, from everything related to society to cultural norms. We all live in bubbles whether we like it or not. And it’s easy to forget about this fact when interacting online. Every time I stumble on someone making some wild claims about something I have to remind myself that maybe that specific thing appears wild to me because of my circumstances and it might be perfectly normal and reasonable somewhere else. And that’s why when I’m interacting with someone online I try to be both charitable in my interpretations of what others are saying and also generally curious and open-minded. Sometimes asking a question is all it takes to make a bubble pop and help a conversation move to a more interesting place.</p>                <hr>

## on the edge

date: 2024-07-02, from: Ayjay blog

Above you see what I believe was the key moment in today’s match between Portugal and Slovenia. After having a penalty saved, astonishingly, by Jan Oblak, Cristiano Ronaldo collapsed in tears, and I mean collapsed: during the break between the two halves of extra time, his shoulders were shaking, he was inconsolable. Several teammates came [&#8230;]

## Crossmark community consultation: What did we learn?

date: 2024-07-02, from: Crossref Blog

<p>In the first half of this year we’ve been talking to our community about post-publication changes and Crossmark. When a piece of research is published it isn’t the end of the journey—it is read, reused, and sometimes modified. That&rsquo;s why we run Crossmark, as a way to provide notifications of important changes to research made after publication. Readers can see if the resesarch they are looking at has updates by clicking the Crossmark logo. They also see useful information about the editorial process, and links to things like funding and registered clinical trials. All of this contributes to what we call the <a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/isr-part-one-what-is-our-role-in-preserving-the-integrity-of-the-scholarly-record/" target="_blank">integrity of the scholarly record</a>.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;margin:10px">
<figure class="img-responsive"><img src="https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2024/Crossmark-popup-example.png"
alt="The Crossmark popup provides information about whether a work is current and other metadata about integrity of the scholarly record." width="75%">
</figure>
</div>
<p>Crossmark has been around a long time and the context around it is constantly changing. It last had a major update in <a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/get-ready-for-crossmark-2.0/" target="_blank">2016</a> and in <a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/encouraging-even-greater-reporting-of-corrections-and-retractions/" target="_blank">2020</a> we removed fees for its use.</p>
<p>The past few years have seen a more intense focus on research integrity, leading to more retractions and calling out large-scale manipulation of editorial processes. At the same time, we haven’t seen an increase in the uptake of Crossmark, which is still used by only a minority of our members. We would like to know why the uptake is low and whether there is more we can do in this area. To dig into this, in the first part of 2024 we reached out to members of our community.</p>
<h2 id="what-did-we-do">What did we do?</h2>
<p>We wanted to learn about attitudes towards Crossmark and related aspects of research integrity. This was done in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Structured interviews with eight of our members.</li>
<li>Round tables at Crossref LIVE events in Bogota and Nairobi</li>
<li>Surveying a selection of our members, which led to 94 responses.</li>
</ul>
<p>The topics we asked about were related to how post-publication updates are made and communicated, and which metadata demonstrates good practice.</p>
<p>We are extremely grateful to the members who contributed. They provided valuable feedback and have helped to shape the future of Crossmark and our approach to the integrity of the scholarly record.</p>
<h2 id="what-did-we-find">What did we find?</h2>
<p>Across the various groups there were a few common themes, which fell into several areas.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Communication of updates is highly valued, and seen as the most important role that Crossmark can play. Some of those we spoke to would like readers to see if there is an update as soon as a page opens, without having to open a popup. This could be done by having a logo that changes colour, shape, or size.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conversely, not as much enthusiasm was shown for the metadata assertions. These are additional fields that can be displayed to readers in the Crossmark popup. There wasn’t a strong consensus on which commonly-made assertions are the most important for research integrity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is diversity in attitudes towards making updates to published works, what research integrity means, and approaches to workflows for updates. Even within a single organisation, a number of different workflows and multiple staff members might be called on to update published research. This makes things complex and means that it can be difficult to fit Crossmark in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are technical challenges to getting started with Crossmark. Those responsible for implementing Crossmark are often technical staff who struggle with the documentation we provide in English. There is also no plugin for OJS, a widely-used open source editorial software. It is more difficult to deposit Crossmark metadata for books than journal articles, and many article types don’t permit Crossmark metadata at all. On the other hand, those who successfully installed Crossmark found it easy to use and low-maintenance.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, it seems that Crossmark still has an important role to play but there are changes and improvements we can make.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h2>
<p>Here are the main areas we intend to follow up on in the coming months.</p>
<h3 id="implementation">Implementation</h3>
<p>We need to look at how to make implementation more straight-forward. Can we provide multilingual documentation, plugins, run workshops or webinars, or make changes to Crossmark to lower the barrier to entry?</p>
<h3 id="understanding-workflows">Understanding workflows</h3>
<p>Can we collaborate with our members and other organisations to reach a better understanding of how to update published works? Are there alternative workflows we need to support? Have we made it too difficult to understand and implement the options we currently have?</p>
<p>While updates are always likely to be rare, we want to help members understand the benefits of making them. We talked to some members who were proud of never having published a retraction or correction, which left us wondering whether they are missing legitimate opportunities to correct the scholarly record. We also know that for some members and many work types (preprints, for example), updates are made without a separate published notification. Can we better understand the role that the published updates play and communicate updates even if there isn’t a published notice?</p>
<h3 id="ongoing-feedback">Ongoing feedback</h3>
<p>Clearly one size doesn’t fit all when it comes to implementing and communicating updates. We need to find ways of keeping in touch with the community to test new solutions with as broad a range of members as possible. We want to avoid catering to a minority and leaving others struggling to find ways to implement a solution.</p>
<h3 id="custom-metadata">Custom metadata?</h3>
<p>Is there an ongoing need for metadata assertions? Many of the assertions currently made are possible as standard metadata and others could be included in our deposit schema. We want to consider removing the option to add assertions. This needs more feedback from the community, especially those who currently make use of assertions.</p>
<h3 id="redesign-the-ui">Redesign the UI</h3>
<p>Crossmark doesn’t have the recognition with readers we would like. Is there a way we can redesign it to make it more associated with Crossref and accurate metadata? We intend to explore different designs, and test them with members and readers.</p>

## Ladybird browser goes serious: GitHub billionaire co-founder now involved

date: 2024-07-01, from: OS News

Well, it seems we&#8217;ve got a better understanding now of why Andreas Kling decided to leave the SerenityOS project to focus entirely on Ladybird, the web browser that grew out of his hobby operating system. They&#8217;ve got some big plans for where to take Ladybird, and I&#8217;m saying &#8220;they&#8221; because it&#8217;s being backed by a big name. They&#8217;ve set up a fancy new website for the project, which makes it all look a bit more presentable to a general audience. The project is aiming for a first alpha release for Linux and macOS in 2026, and Windows or mobile versions are not something they&#8217;re currently interested in &#8211; they want to get the desktop version to be presentable first. It also seems we&#8217;re not in Kansas anymore &#8211; they&#8217;ve got four full-time paid engineers working on Ladybird at the moment, with three more starting soon. Sure, they&#8217;ve got some sponsors, but that seems like a lot of people, so where&#8217;s the cash coming from? Well, the project also announced its first two board members, and it won&#8217;t surprise you Andreas Kling himself is one of them. The other name is none other than Chris Wanstrath, and if that name doesn&#8217;t ring a bell &#8211; he&#8217;s the co-founder and former CEO of GitHub, which he sold to Microsoft in 2018. He also created the Atom text editor and led several other projects. Oh, he also happens to be a billionaire who apparently has donated 1 million dollars to Ladybird. In other words, the Ladybird project is a lot more of a serious, grown-up effort than it may have seemed when Kling first announced his departure from SerenityOS. This means the project has some serious money behind it, an influential name with probably some great networking skills, and, of course, Kling&#8217;s unique experience working on browser engines for Nokia and Apple in the past. All in all, this is great news.

## Jeff Jarvis and Dave in conversation

date: 2024-07-01, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I just did an approx 40 minute <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/01/jeffJarvisDiscusses.m4a">podcast</a> interview and discussion with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Jarvis">Jeff Jarvis</a>. I know Jeff from the early days of blogging. He was one of the best discussion leaders at BloggerCon. And he's an accomplished author and educator. </p>
<p>We talk about how to organize news for people who are information starved by whatever it is that our news sources are doing, which is really hard to figure out, but in the end (I argue) who cares why, we have a problem to solve, so let's get on with it.</p>
<p>I talk about the blogging at the Dean campaign in 2004, that's how they got around journalism. I'm sure that's where we have to go, put together what we think would be the Biden blog if the campaign was being run by Joe and Nicco, and I'd be on board, so would Jeff, and we'd help Heather Cox Richardson, and amplify anyone who is making sense and supports democracy. </p>
<p>It could be funded by the <a href="http://scripting.com/2016/07/01/1342.html">People's PAC</a>, or something like it. It wouldn't take very much money, it's just a blog. But it would have powerful ideas that cut through the <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/03/bullshit.m4a">bullshit</a>, and great videos, and we'd organize marches where people show up to help people.</p>
<p>And the campaign would never stop, we'd always be organizing.</p>
<p>This is the discussion I wanted to start. </p>
<p>Hope you enjoy! :-)</p>
<p>PS: Jeff's mike is much better than mine. Gotta work on that. </p>

## Below MI – IBM i for hackers

date: 2024-07-01, from: OS News

In this writeup we provide a summary of technical information crucial to evaulate the exploitability and impact of memory safety problems in IBM i programs. As administrators and developers of IBM i aren’t supposed to work “below MI level” this kind of information is not officially documented by the vendor. The information presented here is thus based on already published reverse engineering results, and our own findings uncovered using IBM’s System Sertice Tools (SST) and the POWER-AS specific Processor extensions we developed for the Ghidra reverse engineering framework. Tests were performed on a physical POWER 9 system running IBM i V7R4. Programs were compiled by the default settings of the system in the ILE program model. C language source code will be provided separately. ↫ Silent Signal Some light reading.

## 2024-06-30 Connecting the laptop to the server using UUCP

date: 2024-07-01, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-06-30-connecting-the-laptop-to-the-server-using-uucp">2024-06-30 Connecting the laptop to the server using UUCP</h1>

<p>I recently <a href="2024-06-15-uucp">connected my server to another server via UUCP</a>.
Now I&rsquo;m thinking that perhaps I&rsquo;d like to connect my laptop as another node to it.
I probably don&rsquo;t need it, because I <a href="2024-06-28-nncp">connected the laptop to the server via NNCP</a>.
But still. Perhaps <a class="account" href="https://social.sdfeu.org/@lkh" title="@lkh@social.sdfeu.org">@lkh</a> still wants to do stuff via UUCP.
Perhaps it is the completionist in me.</p>

<p>For reference, see <a href="https://www.bortzmeyer.org/uucp-over-ssh.pdf">UUCP over SSH</a> by <a class="account" href="https://mastodon.gougere.fr/@bortzmeyer" title="@bortzmeyer@mastodon.gougere.fr">@bortzmeyer</a>.
Since we&rsquo;re using SSH, there will be a key pair, and since we&rsquo;re using UUCP, we&rsquo;ll still a username and password.
It&rsquo;s going to be both.</p>

<p>I know, why aren&rsquo;t we using NNCP.</p>

<p>Generate the key pair.</p>

<pre><code>cd /var/spool/uucp
sudo mkdir .ssh
sudo chown uucp:uucp .ssh
cd .ssh
sudo -u uucp ssh-keygen -C &quot;uucp@melanobombus&quot; -f id_rsa
</code></pre>

<p>The file <code>uucp-key.pub</code> now has the public key.</p>

<p>On the server (!), add a line to <code>/var/spool/uucp/.ssh/authorized_keys</code>, replacing the public key:</p>

<pre><code>restrict,command=&quot;/usr/sbin/uucico -u Umelanobombus -l&quot; ssh-rsa KEY_FROM_ID_RSA_PUB uucp@dwalin
</code></pre>

<p>We will be using the username <code>Umelanobombus</code> to connect to the server.
This is not a real user!</p>

<p>On the server, save username and password in <code>/etc/uucp/passwd</code>.</p>

<pre><code>Umelanobombus *secret*
</code></pre>

<p>On the laptop, save system name, username and the same password in <code>/etc/uucp/call</code>.</p>

<pre><code>sibirocobombus Umelanobombus *secret*
</code></pre>

<p>Now we have both levels: the public and private keys that allow the <code>uucp</code> user to connect via <code>ssh</code> – and the username and password that is used by <code>uucp</code>.</p>

<p>Define our own name in <code>/etc/uucp/config</code> on the laptop.</p>

<pre><code>nodename	melanobombus
</code></pre>

<p>Let&rsquo;s add the system to <code>/etc/uucp/sys</code>.
That is, on the laptop, define the server we&rsquo;re going to call.
Since I already know that sibirocobombus will report itself as <code>campaignwiki</code>, I&rsquo;m setting up an <code>alias</code>.
The <code>commands</code> line is important because by default only <code>rmail</code> and <code>rnews</code> are allowed but I want to allow <code>rsmtp</code>, too.
The <code>chat</code> script waits for the &ldquo;Password:&rdquo; prompt and then sends it.
Note that this chat script is much shorter than the one used in &ldquo;UUCP over SSH&rdquo;, linked above.
Apparently there&rsquo;s no &ldquo;Login:&rdquo; prompt on my server so I had to change it.</p>

<pre><code>system sibirocobombus
alias campaignwiki
commands rmail rnews rsmtp
call-login *
call-password *
time any
chat Password: \P
chat-timeout 30
protocol i
port ssh_campaignwiki
</code></pre>

<p>Add the new port to <code>etc/uucp/port</code>.
Note that I&rsquo;m listening to incoming <code>ssh</code> connections on a non-standard port so I have to provide.
Also note that here we&rsquo;re defining the <code>uucp</code> &ldquo;port&rdquo; with a non-standard <code>ssh</code> &ldquo;port&rdquo;.
Just in case you&rsquo;re not already confused.</p>

<pre><code>port ssh_campaignwiki
type pipe
command /usr/bin/ssh -a -x -q -p 882 uucp@campaignwiki.org
reliable true
protocol etyig
</code></pre>

<p>Before doing our first test, make sure that the server is a &ldquo;known host&rdquo; on the laptop, for the <code>uucp</code> user.
Note how I am not using <code>-q</code> because I want to see the prompt!</p>

<p>The password to give on the prompt is the one in <code>/etc/uucp/call</code>.</p>

<pre><code>sudo -u uucp ssh -p 882 uucp@campaignwiki.org
The authenticity of host '[campaignwiki.org]:882 ([2a02:418:6a04:178:209:50:237:1]:882)' can't be established.

This key is not known by any other names.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
Warning: Permanently added '[campaignwiki.org]:882' (ED25519) to the list of known hosts.
PTY allocation request failed on channel 0
Password: *secret*
Shere=campaignwiki
^C
</code></pre>

<p>Let&rsquo;s add the laptop to <code>/etc/uucp/sys</code> on the server.
Since the server is never going to call the laptop, no credentials and no port is required.</p>

<pre><code>system melanobombus
called-login Umelanobombus
commands rmail rnews rsmtp
local-send /
local-receive /var/spool/uucppublic
remote-send /
remote-receive /var/spool/uucppublic
time any
forward ANY
protocol i
</code></pre>

<p>Let&rsquo;s test it!</p>

<p>On the client:</p>

<pre><code>echo hallo &gt; hallo.txt
uucp hallo.txt 'sibirocobombus!~/'
</code></pre>

<p>Let&rsquo;s check the log.</p>

<p>This is what it looks like when things don&rsquo;t work:</p>

<pre><code>uulog|tail
uucp sibirocobombus alex (2024-06-30 18:02:27.50 9274) Queuing send of /home/alex/hallo.txt to ~/

uucico sibirocobombus - (2024-06-30 18:02:31.51 9275) ERROR: Line disconnected
</code></pre>

<p>You can try to replace <code>-q</code> with <code>-v</code> in <code>/etc/uucp/port</code> in order to see what <code>ssh</code> has to say.</p>

<p>If you try again, the log says that the system is not ready to try again:</p>

<pre><code>uucp sibirocobombus alex (2024-06-30 18:04:47.94 9454) Queuing send of /home/alex/hallo.txt to ~/
uucico sibirocobombus - (2024-06-30 18:04:47.94 9455) Retry time not reached
</code></pre>

<p>Force a call and check the log again.</p>

<pre><code>sudo -u uucp uucico -S sibirocobombus
</code></pre>

<p>You might be specifying the wrong login, or using the wrong chat script.
On the server, the log might look as follows:</p>

<pre><code>uulog|tail
uucico - - (2024-06-30 17:56:42.92 1245805) Incoming call (login Umelanobombus port stdin)
uucico - - (2024-06-30 17:56:49.12 1245805) ERROR: Line disconnected

uucico - - (2024-06-30 18:07:25.26 1248690) ERROR: Bad login
</code></pre>

<p>Check the passwords:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>/etc/uucp/call</code> on the laptop says what username and password to use</li>
<li><code>/etc/uucp/passwd</code> on the server says what username and password to accept, separated by a TAB (!)</li>
</ol>

<p>Check the system:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>/etc/uucp/config</code> on the laptop says what the client is called</li>
<li><code>/etc/uucp/sys</code> on the laptop says what the server is called and how to connect to it, using what port</li>
<li><code>/etc/uucp/port</code> on the laptop describes that port</li>
<li><code>/etc/uucp/sys</code> on the server says what the client is called, what username to expect</li>
</ol>

<p>Check the login again, by going through it by hand.
Check whether the chat script would have worked.</p>

<pre><code>sudo -u uucp ssh -p 882 uucp@campaignwiki.org
PTY allocation request failed on channel 0
Password: *secret*
Shere=campaignwiki
^C
</code></pre>

<p>When calling the server, specify a high debugging level:</p>

<pre><code>sudo -u uucp uucico -x 11 -S sibirocobombus
</code></pre>

<p>To look at the debug output.
Here&rsquo;s an example where I mistyped the nodename in <code>/etc/uucp/config</code> on the laptop:</p>

That's how I feel about it too. But I know there's interesting data here, how people are connected to people. I'm still trying to figure out how to make a browser that engages the mind in that. It can take a long time to figure these things out. I had the basic idea for a blog in 1994, but it wasn't until 1999 that we really had it figured out and implemented for non-techies.

## Go, Octopus, Go!

date: 2024-07-01, from: Status-Q blog

One of the surprising things about Octopus, the UK company from whom we purchase our gas and electricity, is that, despite growing to the point where they handle about a quarter of UK households, they continue to innovate. For a long time, we&#8217;ve been on the &#8216;Octopus Go&#8217; tariff, which means that for the four <a class="more-link excerpt-link" href="https://statusq.org/archives/2024/07/01/12105/">Continue Reading<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right"></span></a>

<p>Shout out to whoever at this block of flats decided to fly a Canadian flag today (presumably because it is Canada Day). Nationalism isn&rsquo;t really my thing but it still put a, uh, smirk on my face as I walked home from the shops.</p>

<p>Caught up with an old friend for lunch today, which has put me in a real good mood :) Need to make sure to do this more often, and not get so caught up in the endless &ldquo;life&rdquo; grind. It&rsquo;d be nice if seeing friends was still as easy as bumping into them at school/wherever, but it&rsquo;s not, so, making the effort is worth it, haha.</p>

## On being humble and accepting success

date: 2024-07-01, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>There’s a subtle difference between being humble and pretending to be something you’re not. If you are successful in some field you can—and should—recognise your success while still being humble and not letting the success make you arrogant. I find that not doing that, not recognising your success in any shape or form, can grind me in the wrong way. Because at some point you start to feel disingenuous. </p>
<p>People and Blog is a passion project. It’s not a “successful” project by any metric. Combining RSS, Email and the site, it probably has a few thousand readers. And don’t get me wrong, it’s great. I’m grateful for that and I’ll continue to post these interviews for as long as I can. 71 incredibly <a href="http://manuelmoreale.com/supporters">kind people</a> have also decided to contribute some of their money to support it and that’s also something I’m very appreciative of.</p>
<p>Still, I think of P&amp;B as a very niche side project, far from being a successful one. Now let’s imagine that instead of a few thousand, the P&amp;B audience was a few hundreds of thousands and instead of 71 people, 7000 were contributing something every month. At the current average that would net me almost 16000$ a month. That’s around 200k a year and it would make me in the top 0.5% of earners here in Italy. Could I still go around claiming my project was not successful? Hell no. I’d be a hypocrite if I were to do that. And you’d be rightfully pissed at me if I were still nudging you to support for 1$ a month while also being part of the 1%.</p>
<p>I find it interesting that the pursuit of endless growth is something we despise when corporations are doing it but it’s not something that bothers us too much when it’s done by “content creators”. And yet, after a certain scale, it’s the same mindset. This is why I love to support small creators who do things simply because they enjoy it and are not driven by other incentives.</p>
<p>I love something <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/pb-om-malik">Om said in his interview </a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I love supporting the small media, but don’t have time for establishment media outlets. I don’t much care for some of the larger blogs as well. And same goes for the larger YouTubers and podcasts. You need to catch them early — that’s when they really are pure and hustling to serve the reader.</p>
</blockquote>                <hr>
                <p>Thank you for keeping RSS alive. You're awesome.</p>

date: 2024-07-01, from: Glasgow Haskell Compiler

<h1>GHC 9.6.6 is now available</h1>
<h4 class="text-muted">Zubin Duggal - 2024-07-01</h4>

<p>The GHC developers are happy to announce the availability of GHC 9.6.6. Binary
distributions, source distributions, and documentation are available on the
<a href="/download_ghc_9_6_6.html">release page</a>.</p>
<p>This release is primarily a bugfix release addressing some issues
found in the 9.6 series. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A fix for a bug in the NCG that could lead to incorrect runtime results due to
erroneously removing a jump instruction (<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/24507">#24507</a>).</li>
<li>A fix for a linker error that manifested on certain platform/toolchain combinations,
particularly darwin with a brew provisioned toolchain, arising due to a confusion
in linker options between GHC and cabal (<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/22210">#22210</a>).</li>
<li>A fix for a compiler panic in the simplifier due to incorrect eta expansion (<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/24718">#24718</a>).</li>
<li>A fix for possible segfaults when using the bytecode interpreter due to incorrect
constructor tagging (<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/24870">#24870</a>).</li>
<li>And a few more fixes</li>
</ul>
<p>A full accounting of changes can be found in the <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/9.6.6/docs/users_guide/9.6.6-notes.html">release notes</a>. As
some of the fixed issues do affect correctness users are encouraged to

## Psycopg 3.2 released

date: 2024-07-01, from: PostgreSQL News

<p>After 846 commits and close to two years in the making, we are very happy to announce the release of <a href="https://www.psycopg.org/psycopg3/docs/">Psycopg 3.2</a>!</p>
<p>This release adds several new features to the Psycopg 3 line, some of which are:</p>
<ul>
<li>support for Numpy scalar types</li>
<li>easier to use notifications reception</li>
<li>the possibility to run queries with PostgreSQL-format parameters</li>
<li>a row factory to return a scalar from a query</li>
<li>asynchronous, encrypted cancellations</li>
<li>support for the many new features added in the upcoming PostgreSQL v17</li>
<li>OpenSSL 3.x bundled with binary packages</li>
</ul>
<p>A few bug bug fixes are included too, which have also been independently released in the 3.1.20 package. Given the high level of compatibility between 3.1 and 3.2, this could be the last release of the 3.1 line.</p>
<p>For further details please check out:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.psycopg.org/psycopg3/docs/news.html#psycopg-3-2">release notes</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.psycopg.org/articles/2024/06/30/psycopg-32-released/">news entry</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that several new features in the 3.2 release require libpq v17, but, because PostgreSQL version 17 has not been released yet, they are not immediately available in the binary packages. In order to use these features you will need a development version of libpq 17 on your system and to use the Python or C source distribution. New packages bundling libpq v17 will be released as soon as the official PostgreSQL 17 has been released.</p>
<p>Thank you very much to everyone who contributed to the project, especially to Denis Laxalde from <a href="https://www.dalibo.com/">Dalibo</a>, indefatigable libpq explorer and always available to solve challenging problems!</p>
<hr>
<p>Psycopg, first v2, now v3, is the de-facto standard for the communication between Python and PostgreSQL, two major components of innumerable businesses and mission-critical infrastructures. Maintaining such a critical library to the highest standard of reliability, completeness, performance requires a lot of care and work.</p>
<p>If you are a Python and PostgreSQL user and would like to make sure that the interface between the two is well maintained and continuously improved, please consider <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/dvarrazzo">supporting the project</a> and to be <a href="https://www.psycopg.org/sponsors/">one of our sponsors</a> 💜</p>
<p>Happy hacking!</p>

## pg_dumpbinary v2.18 released

date: 2024-07-01, from: PostgreSQL News

<p><strong>Grenoble, France - June 22, 2024</strong></p>
<h2>pg_dumpbinary</h2>
<p><code>pg_dumpbinary</code> dumps a PostgreSQL database to a binary format. The resulting dump must be restored
using <code>pg_restorebinary</code>, which is provided.</p>
<p>This is a maintenance release that fixes two bugs in the restore process.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix double copy statements when a table name requires to be quoted.</li>
<li>Fix error when restoring a table with a GENERATED ALWAYS column.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>pg_dumpbinary</code> is useful when:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have bytea that can not be exported by <code>pg_dump</code> because the
  total size of the escape/hex output exceeds 1Gb.</li>
<li>You have custom type that stores <code>\0</code> internally in bytea but data
  are exported by pg_dump as char/varchar/text.  In this case pg_dump
  truncates all data after the first <code>\0</code>, resulting in data loss.</li>
<li>Other cases where a binary output format is useful.</li>
</ul>
<p>In these kinds of cases <code>pg_dumpbinary</code> helps by dumping the
PostgreSQL database in a binary format. In all other cases
the pg_dump/pg_restore commands distributed with PostgreSQL are
preferred.</p>
<p>See the documentation for a more complete description of available
features.</p>
<h2>Links &amp; Credits</h2>

## Greenmask v0.2.0b1 Release

date: 2024-07-01, from: PostgreSQL News

<h1>Greenmask v0.2.0b1 Release</h1>
<h2>PostgreSQL Logical Dump and Anonymization Tool</h2>
<p>This major <strong>beta release</strong> introduces new features and refactored transformers, significantly enhancing Greenmask's flexibility to better meet business needs. Help us improve GreenMask and tailor it to meet community needs. We welcome your feedback in the <a href="https://github.com/GreenmaskIO/greenmask/discussions/129">release discussion on GitHub</a>.</p>
<h2>Greenmask Overview</h2>
<p>Greenmask is a versatile open-source tool for database backup, anonymization, and restoration. Written in pure Go with ported PostgreSQL libraries, it is platform-independent and stateless, requiring no schema modifications. It is customizable and compatible with existing PostgreSQL utilities.</p>
<h3>Greenmask is ideally suited for:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Routine backup and restoration tasks, ensuring data integrity and availability.</li>
<li>Anonymization and data masking for staging environments and analytics, <strong>protecting sensitive</strong> information while maintaining data utility.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Key features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deterministic transformers</strong> — deterministic approach to data transformation based on the hash
  functions. This ensures that the same input data will always produce the same output data. Almost each transformer
  supports either <code>random</code> or <code>hash</code> engine making it universal for any use case.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic parameters</strong> — almost each transformer supports dynamic parameters, allowing to parametrize the
  transformer dynamically from the table column value. This is helpful for resolving the functional dependencies 
  between columns and satisfying the constraints.</li>
<li><strong>Database type safe</strong> - Ensures data integrity by validating data and utilizing the database driver for
  encoding and decoding operations. This approach guarantees the preservation of data formats.</li>
<li><strong>Transformation validation and easy maintainable</strong> - During obfuscation development, Greenmask provides validation
  warnings and a transformation diff feature, allowing you to monitor and maintain transformations effectively
  throughout the software lifecycle.</li>
<li><strong>Partitioned tables transformation inheritance</strong> - Define transformation configurations once and apply them to all
  partitions within partitioned tables, simplifying the obfuscation process.</li>
<li><strong>Stateless</strong> - Greenmask operates as a logical dump and does not impact your existing database schema.</li>
<li><strong>Backward compatible</strong> - It fully supports the same features and protocols as existing vanilla PostgreSQL utilities.
  Dumps created by Greenmask can be successfully restored using the pg_restore utility.</li>
<li><strong>Extensible</strong> - Users have the flexibility to implement domain-based transformations in any programming language or
  use predefined templates.</li>
<li><strong>Provide a variety of storage</strong> - Greenmask offers a variety of storage options for local and remote data storage,
  including directories and S3-like storage solutions.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Playground usage for the beta version</h2>
<p>If you want to run a Greenmask <a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/playground/">playground</a> for the beta version execute:</p>
<p><code>git checkout tags/v0.2.0b1 -b v0.2.0b1
docker-compose run greenmask-from-source</code></p>
<h2>Changes overview</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/dynamic_parameters/">Introduced dynamic parameters in the transformers</a><ul>
<li>Most transformers now support dynamic parameters where applicable.</li>
<li>Dynamic parameters are strictly enforced. If you need to cast values to another type, Greenmask provides templates and predefined cast functions accessible via <code>cast_to</code>. These functions cover frequent operations such as <code>UnixTimestampToDate</code> and <code>IntToBool</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The transformation logic has been significantly refactored, making transformers more customizable and flexible than before.</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/transformation_engines/">Introduced transformation engines</a></p>
<ul>
<li><code>random</code> - generates transformer values based on pseudo-random algorithms.</li>
<li><code>hash</code> - generates transformer values using hash functions. Currently, it utilizes <code>sha3</code> hash functions, which are secure but perform slowly. In the stable release, there will be an option to choose between <code>sha3</code> and <code>SipHash</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/parameters_templating/">Introduced static parameters value template</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Notable changes</h2>
<h3>Core</h3>
<ul>
<li>Introduced the <code>Parametrizer</code> interface, now implemented for both dynamic and static parameters.</li>
<li>Renamed most of the toolkit types for enhanced clarity and comprehensive documentation coverage.</li>
<li>Refactored the <code>Driver</code> initialization logic.</li>
<li>Added validation warnings for overridden types in the <code>Driver</code>.</li>
<li>Migrated existing built-in transformers to utilize the new <code>Parametrizer</code> interface.</li>
<li>Implemented a new abstraction, <code>TransformationContext</code>, as the first step towards enabling new feature transformation conditions (#34).</li>
<li>Optimized most transformers for performance in both dynamic and static modes. While dynamic mode offers flexibility, static mode ensures performance remains high. Using only the necessary transformation features helps keep transformation time predictable.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Documentation</h3>
<p>Documentation has been significantly refactored. New information about features and updates to transformer descriptions have been added.</p>
<h3>Transformers</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/standard_transformers/random_email/">RandomEmail</a> - Introduces a new transformer that supports both random and deterministic engines. It allows for flexible email value generation; you can use column values in the template and choose to keep the original domain or select any from the <code>domains</code> parameter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/standard_transformers/noise_date/">NoiseDate</a>, <a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/standard_transformers/noise_float/">NoiseFloat</a>, <a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/standard_transformers/noise_int/">NoiseInt</a> - These transformers support both random and deterministic engines, offering dynamic mode parameters that control the noise thresholds within the <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> range. Unlike previous implementations which used a single <code>ratio</code> parameter, the new release features <code>min_ratio</code> and <code>max_ratio</code> parameters to define noise values more precisely. Utilizing the <code>hash</code> engine in these transformers enhances security by complicating statistical analysis for attackers, especially when the same salt is used consistently over long periods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/standard_transformers/noise_numeric/">NoiseNumeric</a> - A newly implemented transformer, sharing features with <code>NoiseInt</code> and <code>NoiseFloat</code>, but specifically designed for numeric values (large integers or floats). It provides a <code>decimal</code> parameter to handle values with fractions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/standard_transformers/random_choice/">RandomChoice</a> - Now supports the <code>hash</code> engine</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/standard_transformers/random_date/">RandomDate</a>, <a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/standard_transformers/random_float/">RandomFloat</a>, <a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/standard_transformers/random_int/">RandomInt</a> - Now enhanced with hash engine support. Threshold parameters <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> have been updated to support dynamic mode, allowing for more flexible configurations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/standard_transformers/random_numeric/">RandomNumeric</a> - A new transformer specifically designed for numeric types (large integers or floats), sharing similar features with <code>RandomInt</code> and <code>RandomFloat</code>, but tailored for handling huge numeric values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/standard_transformers/random_string/">RandomString</a> - Now supports hash engine mode</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/standard_transformers/random_unix_timestamp/">RandomUnixTimestamp</a> - This new transformer generates Unix timestamps with selectable units (<code>second</code>, <code>millisecond</code>, <code>microsecond</code>, <code>nanosecond</code>). Similar in function to <code>RandomDate</code>, it supports the hash engine and dynamic parameters for <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> thresholds, with the ability to override these units using <code>min_unit</code> and <code>max_unit</code> parameters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/standard_transformers/random_uuid/">RandomUuid</a> - Added hash engine support</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/standard_transformers/random_person/">RandomPerson</a> - Implemented a new transformer that replaces <code>RandomName</code>, <code>RandomLastName</code>, <code>RandomFirstName</code>, <code>RandomFirstNameMale</code>, <code>RandomFirstNameFemale</code>, <code>RandomTitleMale</code>, and <code>RandomTitleFemale</code>. This new transformer offers enhanced customizability while providing similar functionalities as the previous versions. It generates personal data such as <code>FirstName</code>, <code>LastName</code>, and <code>Title</code>, based on the provided <code>gender</code> parameter, which now supports dynamic mode. Future minor versions will allow for overriding the default names database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added <a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/advanced_transformers/custom_functions/core_functions/#tsmodify">tsModify</a> - a new template function for time.Time objects modification</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Introduced a new <a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/standard_transformers/random_ip/">RandomIp</a> transformer capable of generating a random IP address based on the specified netmask.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added a new <a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/standard_transformers/random_mac/">RandomMac</a> transformer for generating random Mac addresses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deleted transformers include <code>RandomMacAddress</code>, <code>RandomIPv4</code>, <code>RandomIPv6</code>, <code>RandomUnixTime</code>, <code>RandomTitleMale</code>, <code>RandomTitleFemale</code>, <code>RandomFirstName</code>, <code>RandomFirstNameMale</code>, <code>RandomFirstNameFemale</code>, <code>RandomLastName</code>, and <code>RandomName</code> due to the introduction of more flexible and unified options.</p>

## Celebrating five years of Grant IDs: where are we with the Crossref Grant Linking System?

date: 2024-07-01, from: Crossref Blog

<p>We’re happy to note that this month, we are marking five years since Crossref launched its Grant Linking System. The Grant Linking System (GLS) started life as a joint community effort to create ‘grant identifiers’ and support the needs of funders in the scholarly communications infrastructure.</p>
<div class="shortcode-divwrap align-right">
<span><img src="https://www.crossref.org/images/community-images/gls/gls-logo-stacked.png" alt="Crossref Grant Linking System logo" width="100%" ></span>
</div>
The system includes a funder-designed metadata schema and a unique link for each award which enables connections with millions of research outputs, better reporting on the research and outcomes of funding, and a contribution to open science infrastructure. Our first activity to highlight the moment was to host a community call last week where around 30 existing and potential funder members joined to discuss the benefits and the steps to take to participate in the Grant Linking System (GLS).
<p>Some organisations at the forefront of adopting Crossref’s Grant Linking System presented their challenges and how they overcame them, shared the benefits they are reaping from participating, and provided some tips about their processes and workflows.</p>
<p>The funding organisations whose experiences were shared included <a href="https://wellcome.org/" target="_blank">Wellcome</a>, <a href="https://www.fct.pt/en/" target="_blank">FCT (Foundation for Science and Technology, Portugal)</a>, and <a href="https://www.nwo.nl/en" target="_blank">NWO (Dutch Research Council)</a>. They were joined by a new group of foundations, research councils, and private research funders from around the world&mdash;from Kenya to Singapore to Estonia&mdash;to have a first introduction to the GLS and connect them with colleagues who are further along on their journey.</p>
<p>We also heard about tools such as a new <a href="https://github.com/oaworks/create-grant-doi-in-fluxx" target="_blank">open source Crossref plugin</a> for the Fluxx platform, grant management systems with in-built Crossref integrations such as <a href="https://proposalcentral.com/" target="_blank">ProposalCentral</a>, <a href="https://europepmc.org/grantfinder" target="_blank">Europe PMC GrantFinder</a> which was first to implement the GLS on Wellcome’s behalf and hosts their grants, and one of the first publishers, <a href="https://elifesciences.org/" target="_blank">eLife</a> to start referencing Crossref grant links in their publications both online and in the open metadata for others to retrieve.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-crossref-grant-linking-system">What is the Crossref Grant Linking System?</h2>
<p>The Crossref Grant Linking System, conceptualised in 2017, and launched in 2019, captures and helps clarify funding relationships for scholarly outputs. Thanks to interconnectedness with the 160 million metadata records collected and curated by Crossref members, it enables funders as well as scholars to track and analyse funding patterns and evaluate programmes, and it supports assertions about the integrity of scholarly records.</p>
<h3 id="features-of-the-gls">Features of the GLS</h3>
<ul>
<li>Globally unique persistent link and identifier for each grant</li>
<li>Connected with 160 million published outputs</li>
<li>Funder-designed metadata schema, including project, investigator, value, and award-type information</li>
<li>Programmatic or no-code methods to send metadata
<ul>
<li>Thanks to the <a href="https://www.moore.org/" target="_blank">Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation</a> who funded development of the <a href="https://manage.crossref.org/records" target="_blank">online grant registration form</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Open search and API for all to discover funding outcomes; all metadata is distributed openly to thousands of tools and services</li>
<li>Crossref-hosted landing pages</li>
<li>A global community of ~50 funder advisors and 35+ funders already in the Grant Linking System</li>
<li>Membership of Crossref; influence the foundational infrastructure powering open research</li>
</ul>
<p>The last five years has seen the GLS grow through membership, metadata, and community contributions.</p>

alt="graph showing the effects of specific funders joining that increase matches and relationships in the Crossref Grant Linking System" width="100%">
</figure>
<br>
The momentum for this programme is building - as illustrated by increasing numbers of metadata records (and related relationships we’re seeing). The 35 funder members represent over 100 funding programmes and have created 125,000 grant records already.</p>

</figure>
<p>During last week&rsquo;s call, it was helpful to hear from the community what they see as key benefits of the Crossref Grant Linking System:</p>
<div class='shortcode-row '>
<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12 no-first-para-highlight"><ul>
<li>Meaningfully delivering on and supporting Open Science policies and mandates, and contributing ‘their bit’ to the transparency of the evidence trail in the scholarly ecosystem.</li>
<li>Reporting and evaluating the funding programmes, essential for the public funders who need to demonstrate the value for money in allocating their funds and other support.</li>
<li>Supporting a more holistic assessment of scholarship and scholars, especially as and when metadata becomes included with a full array of outputs, not limited to books and articles.</li>
</ul>

</div>
</div>
<h2 id="how-the-crossref-grant-linking-system-supports-open-science-policy">How the Crossref Grant Linking System supports Open Science policy</h2>
<p>Since 2020, all the grant records are openly available through our REST API which is queried more than 1.8 billion times every month so these metadata records are distributed to thousands of systems across the research enteprise. In a 2022 blog, Ed Pentz and Ginny Hendricks laid out <a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/how-funding-agencies-can-meet-ostp-and-open-science-guidance-using-existing-open-infrastructure/">guidelines for research funders to meet open science guidelines</a> using existing open infrastructure such as Crossref, ORCID, and ROR. Syman Stevens, a grantmaking and private philanthropy consultant, highlighted on the call that the funders he works with are increasingly interested in ways to deliver on their open science policy and that particpation in the GLS is a tangible thing they can do to meet this goal.</p>
<div class="quotecite">
<blockquote>
<p>As part of its open science policy, NWO will start participating in the Crossref Grant Linking System from July 2025. Research funders are a part of the scholarly communications system; we not only provide the funding to do the actual research but can also be the authoritative source of data about the projects we have funded and the outputs arising from that funding. Increasingly, all these elements – grants, researchers, outputs - are linked with metadata and unique identifiers to ensure that research is findable and accessible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><cite>&ndash; Hans de Jonge, Director of Open Science NL, part of the Dutch Research Council (NWO)</cite></p>
</div>
<h2 id="how-funders-leverage-the-grant-linking-system-in-their-reporting-and-assessment">How funders leverage the Grant Linking System in their reporting and assessment</h2>
<p>Looking back to the origins of the system, it’s important to recognise the work of the initial working groups. Through their contribution, funders helped design the initial metadata schema for grants as well as establish the governance and fees for this service, and our Advisory Group continues to inform further developments. In this way, the Grant Linking System enables the needs and wishes of funders to contribute and see their data as part of the wider ecosystem.</p>
<p>An excellent example of that synergy in action is the use case presented by Cátia Laranjeira, manager of the PTCRIS programme at the Foundation for Science and Technology, Portugal (FCT). PTCRIS is the Foundation’s integrated national information ecosystem that supports scientific activity management. Cátia reflected on the relative fragmentation of spaces where the scientific outputs are found, and PTCRIS’s ambition for aggregating metadata in one place to be able to trace and evaluate programmes in light of the related outputs. At the start of the programme, they identified lack of a persistent identifier for grants as a major shortcoming of the system. Crossref GLS naturally fits in with their goals.</p>
<div class="quotecite">
<blockquote>
<p>The initiative by FCT to assign unique DOIs to national public funding through Crossref is a game-changer for open science, linking funding directly to scientific outcomes and boosting transparency. Join us in this effort—let&rsquo;s make every grant count and ensure open access to research information!&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><cite>&ndash; Cátia Laranjeira, PTCRIS Program Manager at Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologis (FCT Portugal)</cite></p>
</div>
<p>FCT initially piloted a small subset of their grants (approximately 6,000 recent awards) at the end of 2023. Cátia pointed to researchers’ keen participation in this programme as one of its successes – and thanks to the word of mouth, FCT has already been approached by researchers requesting unique Crossref links for their grants! This appetite for grant IDs will soon be more fully satisfied, as FCT is readying to register all of their grants with Crossref, to enable further insights into funding and outcome flows, supporting them in demonstrating the value for money for the public resources they manage. Via interfaces for grant management and standardised online CVs, the system is also enabling researchers to use the system in their own future reporting and career development.</p>
<p>In the ensuing discussion, Rachel Bruce of UKRI mentioned that she’s hopeful that GLS will help funders ‘close the loop’ on more holistic reward and recognition, allowing for inclusion of evidence for a broader set of outputs in those processes.</p>
<h2 id="how-the-community-is-working-to-integrate-open-infrastructure">How the community is working to integrate open infrastructure</h2>
<p>Melissa Harrison, Team Leader at EMBL-EBI, manages Europe PMC and a complementary data science team, who were part of the initial FREYA project – supporting infrastructure delivery for unique identifiers for grants. The team has been adding grant records to Crossref on Wellcome’s behalf since 2019. Melissa highlighted the shortcomings of internal award numbers, which don’t tend to be understood outside of the ecosystem where they are produced (that is the funder’s administrative system), are almost certainly not unique, and don’t resolve to or connect with anything in the wider ecosystem. Therefore internal award numbers can’t signify relationships with other outputs or assets in the wider world. By contrast, Crossref’s Grant IDs are unique, persistent, resolvable, and interrelated with other Crossref metadata, whilst being retrievable for other systems to link to too.</p>
<div class="quotecite">
<blockquote>
<p>Persistent identifiers for grants was the next logical step after identifiers for funders - open metadata registered with a PID in a central service like Crossref is invaluable to build the full picture of the research enterprise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><cite>&ndash; Melissa Harrison, Team Leader, Literature Services at EMBL-EBI)</cite></p>
</div>
<p>Ease of execution is important for scaling the Grant Linking System, and enabling its use in a diverse set of circumstances in the open science ecosystem. Altum was the trailblazer, first integrating its grant management platform Proposal Central with GLS. It was good to hear that others are now joining the integration efforts. Syman Stevens talked about the recent work initiated by Joe McArthur at <a href="https://oa.works/" target="_blank">OA Works</a>, to develop a simple, open-source plug-in for any of the major grant management systems, to enable funders to deposit their grant metadata with Crossref GLS with a click of the button. Syman demonstrated the resulting interface in Fluxx, that allows for creating a record and sending grant metadata to Crossref as part of the regular grant management within the platform. He pointed out that, while this integration was developed for Fluxx, all code and documentation is openly available on <a href="https://github.com/oaworks/create-grant-doi-in-fluxx" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and this can potentially be forked or adapted as necessary for reuse in other grant management systems.</p>
<p>It is heartening that others in the community are seeing such a need for this that they&rsquo;re funding and creating their own tools to advance participation and use of the GLS.</p>
<p>Finally, Fred Atherden, Head of Production Operations at eLife, presented how they include Crossref grant identifiers in publication metadata for the version of record of the works published on their platform. eLife is the first publisher to fully integrate Crossref grant identifiers both within the article display and in the metadata. Fred shared that in addition to collecting the data from the authors, eLife also attempts matching, albeit using very restrictive methodology, to enable more grant metadata in their publication records. They recognise that so far there are very few publishers including persistent links for grants in this way, and talked about plans to start collecting and including this data further upstream, and including them in the future for reviewed preprints.</p>
<h2 id="acknowledgements-and-how-to-participate-in-the-gls">Acknowledgements and how to participate in the GLS</h2>
<p>Reflecting on the last five years, thanks must go to the &gt;35 funders who are already participating (see logo mashup below), to our <a href="https://www.crossref.org/working-groups/funders">current volunteers</a> and to those partners working to promote and make use of the Grant Linking System. We also acknowledge that the GLS would not have been possible without the Crossref board members at the time, our staff including alumni Josh Brown, Rachael Lammey, and Geoffrey Bilder, or without the early dedicated time and input from the following people and organisations on our working groups for governance and fees, and for metadata modelling:</p>

## Vivaldi takes firm stance against AI, will not include it in its browser

date: 2024-06-30, from: OS News

The web browser Vivaldi is taking a firm stance against including machine learning tools to its browser. So, as we have seen, LLMs are essentially confident-sounding lying machines with a penchant to occasionally disclose private data or plagiarise existing work. While they do this, they also use vast amounts of energy and are happy using all the GPUs you can throw at them which is a problem we’ve seen before in the field of cryptocurrencies. As such, it does not feel right to bundle any such solution into Vivaldi. There is enough misinformation going around to risk adding more to the pile. We will not use an LLM to add a chatbot, a summarization solution or a suggestion engine to fill up forms for you until more rigorous ways to do those things are available. ↫ Julien Picalausa on the Vivaldi blog I&#8217;m not a particular fan of Vivaldi personally &#8211; it doesn&#8217;t integrate with KDE well visually and its old-fashioned-Opera approach of throwing everything but the kitchen sink at itself is just too cluttered for me &#8211; but props to the Vivaldi team for taking such clear and firm stance. There&#8217;s a ton of pressure from big money interests to add machine learning to everything from your operating system to your nail scissors, and popular tech publishers are certainly going to publish articles decrying Vivaldi&#8217;s choice, so they&#8217;re not doing this without any risk. With even Firefox adding machine learning tools to the browser, there&#8217;s very few &#8211; if any &#8211; browsers left, other than Vivaldi, it seems &#8211; that will be free of these tools. I can only hope we&#8217;re going to see a popular Firefox fork without this nonsense take off, and I&#8217;m definitely keeping my eye on the various options that already exist today.

## Neo Geo architecture: a practical analysis

date: 2024-06-30, from: OS News

Straight from the arcade world, the Neo Geo was, without a doubt, the most expensive hardware of the 4th generation. This begs the question: how capable was it and how did it compare with the rest? In this entry, we’ll take a look at the result of one company (SNK) setting budget restrictions aside and shipping a product meant to please both arcade owners and rich households. ↫ Rodrigo Copetti Rich households, indeed. Back in the &#8217;90s, when Nintendo was the only game in town &#8211; few people in my area cared one bit about Sega &#8211; Neo Geo was a name we only knew of vaguely. It was supposed to be a massively powerful console that was so expensive nobody bought one, and some of us even doubted it was real in the first place. Ah, the pre-internet playground days were wild.

## Mini 4WD

date: 2024-06-30, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>The algorithm sucked me into another model craft hobby: Mini 4WD racing (ミニ四駆). A Mini 4WD is a 1:32 scale model that is a mix between slot cars and RC cars. You don’t control these cars with a remote control nor do they drive in an electrified slot, rather you place your racecar in a plastic track with high walls and send them speeding down the track at ~40km/h.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2ZZL5i8vOXM?si=ED2YFsLdI9z7BMbG" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>The twist is you don’t know <a href="https://tamiya.com/japan/mini4wd/feature/2019/1206.html">what the track looks like</a> until race day, so you have to be ready to adapt. There might a big jump, moguls, or a tall mountain to climb. Once racers have seen the course, they have some time to make adjustments by balancing engineering choices about weight, power, braking, handling, batteries, downforce, and more. Are you going to make your car lighter and full send it over the tabletops? Or is slow and steady going to win the race? The races are a brief cacophony of slapping plastic and whirring motors but I can feel the electricity of the room through the screen.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/jcjc.jpg" alt="Untitled" /></p>
<p>Where YouTube hooked me was watching custom 4WD Mini builders like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@azpaca0">アズパカ</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Niwakara">にわから</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@techyuuta">ユウタ</a>. They are hellbent on making their cars as fast as possible. In Japanese they call it “タイムアタック” (“Time Attack”). For their time attacks, they use the <a href="https://d7z22c0gz59ng.cloudfront.net/cms/japan/mini4wd/topics/feature/2019_12/circuit_1911_2c1_002.jpg">Japan Cup Junior Circuit</a> (JCJC) course; a three lane track with a wave feature and a wicked lane change from the inner lane to the outer lane that will send light or fast cars flying off the course. The standardized course (and video format<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>) is where the similarities stop because their cars are anything but conventional.</p>
<p>The videos are all about iteration and experimentation. Testing all kinds of parts and gimmicks like 3D printed chassis, side rollers, battery types, motors, wheels, and downforce options. Sometimes the tweaks are small, sometimes they are radical innovations:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8mXdQ9oW2c">An entirely “blade” flat chassis</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rgALusRMAs&amp;t=396s">A chassis with all the weight to one side</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o--_xP1xBA">A bendy chassis to bend around corners.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKWx_TMOzvo">A chassis with a motor on each wheel</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8mXdQ9oW2c">A chassis with a computer fan in the middle</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuqw_Bf08">A car with knives</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1J8fqEXrv0">A dual-fan chassis that looks like a GPU</a>.</li>
<li>A car with model rocket engines!? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRpmNh-kOkE">Why not</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>That sort of raw, no-rules experimentation is refreshing to watch. It looks like dumb fun. A reason to own a 3D printer. They experiments don’t always work and will fail spectacularly, but lessons get learned. And if you watch enough videos, you see them getting faster.</p>
<ul>
<li>A stock car will complete all three laps in about 5 seconds.</li>
<li>Cars they made a year ago will go around in 3 seconds.</li>
<li>Cars they made six months ago, 2 seconds.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lyoc3my8suY&amp;t=3s">A car from one month ago, 1.63 seconds.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I’m not sure why Mini 4WD strikes such a chord with me. It could be nostalgia for my RC car days as a ten year old. It could be my penchant for Japanese model making. But I probably know what hooks me the most: this is the flavor of engineering optimization work I like to do. Make it lighter, faster, and able to handle bumps in the road. Websites are of course vastly different than mechanical engineering… but the correlation between weight and speed are enough to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240227130052/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alZvGsOVh3o">activate my brain</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/mini4wd.jpg" alt="Untitled" /></p>
<p>So I bought a <a href="https://amzn.to/3W5aHoc">Mini 4WD Starter Pack</a> (and one for my son) to close the loop on my curiosity. They’re only ~$20, so why not. The hitch in the plan is that a beginner track costs $120. It would nice to have an opportunity to run around a complex track without an upfront cost. My hobby shop used to host races and have a track in-store before COVID, but not anymore. Maybe I can provide this as a service to my kids’ friends… yeah… that’s a good justification.</p>

—is not this: By now we take it for granted. To live your digital life on the Internet, you need accounts. Lots of them. You need one for every website that provides a service, plus your Mac or Windows computers, your Apple or Google-based phones, your home and mobile ISPs. Sure, you can use a [&#8230;]

## The things we carry

date: 2024-06-30, from: John Udell blog

For a long time there were only two essential things that I carried everywhere: keys and wallet. Two was a manageable number of objects that I had to remember to put into pockets, and two was a manageable number of pockets to put them in. Then my first phone bumped that number to three. When &#8230; <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2024/06/30/the-things-we-carry/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">The things we carry</span></a>

Biden has a base. He should communicate directly with us. Joe, tell us you saw what we saw. A snake oil salesman. A con man. A loser. A criminal. We heard the tape of him blackmailing the Secretary of State of Georgia. He wanted the military to shoot Black Lives Matter protestors. Did he sell our secrets to Putin and others? He did all kinds of horrible stuff that the press has forgotten to talk about. The biggest problem here isn't Biden's age, though it is a problem, it's the controlling nature of our journalism, and the lack of any oversight. They can't be criticized because all we have are our individual voices, with no organization. We keep paying the price. This podcast is in the form of a voicemail to an old friend, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Jarvis">Jeff Jarvis</a>, who I introduce at the beginning of the podcast. We share the same frustrations, I can see it in his posts on various social media networks. I'd like to elevate our discourse. And in the meantime, imho, it's a pretty good story. <i>10 minutes.</i>  <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>

## The Mimo Diaries: Feedback and Directory

date: 2024-06-30, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>Another quick update for those who are interested on the <a href="http://minimalissimo.com">Minimalissimo</a> side of my digital life. For those who don’t know, at the beginning of 2024 I took charge of Minimalissimo and I’m now curating it, updating it, designing and coding for it, and steering it towards its future. It’s a fun project to work on and I have a ton of ideas but also very little time. It’s a one man show and there’s a lot to do.</p>
<p>Today I pushed live a <a href="https://minimalissimo.com/feedback">feedback page</a> because I have a couple of decisions to take and I don’t want to do it blindly. So if you are a reader of the site I’d really appreciate if you can take a moment and share your thoughts on a few subjects. It shouldn’t take too long, maybe 5 minutes at most.</p>
<p>The other thing I’ve been working on is a new directory that collects in one place links to people and brands that are aligned with the Minimalissimo vision. It’s something that’s incredibly useful for me to have online because it will make the curation of the site easier and that’s huge because curation can be very time consuming.</p>
<figure class="m-o" data-template="with"><div class="m-m"><img class="img" loading="lazy" src="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/the-mimo-diaries-feedback-and-directory/1ce9c04ce7-1719754147/directory-1.jpg" style="aspect-ratio:1000 / 667"></div></figure>
<p>The directory is ready form a technical point of view but now I need to add content to it and that will take me some time. I have more than a thousand links to go through and my hope is to have it live before the end of the summer. We’ll see how it goes.</p>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-06-30, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

Challenging questions: Why don't journalists cover the Biden base? Do they even consider the possibility that there is one? Or do they think they are the base? I thought they weren't supposed to care who the nominees are? Why do they feel entitled to say one candidate should withdraw but not the other? Have any of them even thought this through?

## Marcus goes gaga over Gates clip

date: 2024-06-30, from: Gary Marcus blog

It&#8217;s been a long while since I have felt really positive about most of what I have been reading and seeing in AI. Not because I inherently dislike AI, but because I feel like so many folks have been brainwashed by the &#8220;scale is all you need&#8221; notion and &#8220;AGI in 2025&#8221; (or 2027 or 2029) nonsense, none of which seems remotely plausible to me as a cognitive scientist.

## This Month in Redox - June 2024

date: 2024-06-30, from: Redox OS News

June was a very exciting month for Redox! Here&rsquo;s all the latest news.
Donate to Redox If you would like to support Redox, please consider donating or buying some merch!
 Donate Patreon Merch  Funding! NLnet NGI Zero Core We are very excited to announce that the NGI Zero Core program from the NLnet Foundation will be funding our project Redox OS Unix-style Signals.
Redox currently has a basic implementation of Signals, but this project will allow us to move most of signals code out of the kernel into user-space, and bring us much closer to POSIX compliance.
