## The misguided backlash against California’s SB-1047

date: 2024-06-07, from: Gary Marcus blog

State Senator Scott Wiener and others in California have proposed a bill, SB-1047m that would some modest (to my taste) restraints on AI. It doesn&#8217;t call for a private right of action, which would allow individual citizens to sue AI companies for a wide set of reasons; it doesn&#8217;t call for ban on training or deploying AI, not even the kind of extremely large language models some called for ban on. It certainly doesn&#8217;t call for a ban on research, The most stringent rules don&#8217;t even apply to training runs that cost less than a $100 million dollars, exempting all or nearly all academic research, and most of what smaller and even medium-sized startups could afford. It doesn&#8217;t call for the state to make decisions about what can be deployed, as an FDA-like approval process for drugs does.

## Quick out-of-the-box BSD support for the Topton GM1

date: 2024-06-07, from: OS News

I bought a Topton GM1 Industrial Mini PC for my HomeLab. It is aimed at running Slackware Linux but I wanted to have a quick look at how well BSD OSes support it out-of-the-box. ↫ Joel Carnat That&#8217;s really all there&#8217;s to this story. I just really, really love tiny industrial and office computers and thin clients, and every time I see another one for sale I really have to stop myself from buying one I have absolutely no use for. There&#8217;s just something about how these little guys are built that speaks to me &#8211; they&#8217;re different than regular PCs, but only marginally so, making them fun to play around with, getting drivers for everything, seeing if Linux and BSD have any issues with it, and so on. They&#8217;re also often fanless, which is a major boon. The Dell thin client I wrote about last week has been run through a gauntlet of operating systems to see just how capable it is, and I&#8217;m surprise by just how much you can do even with a pedestrian Pentium Silver. For now it&#8217;s running Fedora GNOME to get an idea how the most default of default Linux environments performs and feels &#8211; so I can include it in future articles about it &#8211; but I think I&#8217;m going to set it up as a retrogaming console using Batocera. Industrial, office, and thin client computers are just fun to play around with, and they&#8217;re incredibly cheap when buying used. If things like a Raspberry Pi are hard to get, backordered, or overpriced due to demand outstripping supply, it&#8217;s definitely a good idea to see if you can find some cast-off thin client or whatever for your project instead.

## Microsoft blocks Windows 11 workaround that enabled local accounts

date: 2024-06-07, from: OS News

Before PC users can enjoy everything Windows 11 has on tap, they must first enter an e-mail address that’s linked to a Microsoft account. If you don’t have one, you’ll be asked to create one before you can start setting it up. A frequently used trick to circumvent this block is a small but ingenious step. By entering a random e-mail address and password, which doesn’t exist and causes the link to fail, you end up directly with the creation of a local account and can thus avoid creating an official account with Microsoft. ↫ Laura Pippig at PCWorld Microsoft has now &#8220;fixed&#8221; this trick, and it&#8217;s no longer possible to use it. The other popular method of circumventing the Microsoft account requirement, by opening the command prompt during installation and running OOBE\BYPASSNRO, still works, but one has to wonder how long it&#8217;s going to take before Microsoft plugs that method, too. It seems the company is hell-bent on getting every consumer onto the Microsoft Account train, come hell or high water, so I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised seeing local accounts eventually being positioned as a &#8220;pro&#8221; or even &#8220;enterprise&#8221; feature that will simply no longer be available on consumer PCs. I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything inherently wrong with offering an online account option, but the keyword here is option. You should always be able to set up any computer to run with a regular old local account, even if only because internet access isn&#8217;t always a given in many places around the world. Add the obvious privacy concerns to that &#8211; an issue amplified by Recall &#8211; and I doubt users&#8217; desire to run a local account and jump through hoops to do so will fade any time soon.

## 2024-06-06 Learning to be a programmer

date: 2024-06-07, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-06-06-learning-to-be-a-programmer">2024-06-06 Learning to be a programmer</h1>

<p>I was talking with <a class="account" href="https://merveilles.town/@akkartik" title="@akkartik@merveilles.town">@akkartik</a> and <a class="account" href="https://mas.to/@TodePond" title="@TodePond@mas.to">@TodePond</a> about programming.</p>

<p><a class="account" href="https://mas.to/@TodePond" title="@TodePond@mas.to">@TodePond</a> got me thinking about communities around programming when they wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the problem i see is that no one is talking to each other. everyone is trying to build their solutions in isolation - as island communities. in my opinion we shouldnt build anything new, we should try to make compatible the mindsets and tools that we already have. its an extreme viewpoint but i see no one else taking it, so im taking it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can definitely see many people writing their own software and many more people using existing software and never adapting it. I do it, too!</p>

<p>To put a really hurtful spin onto it: we rarely sit next to a newbie using our software. I never do. Never. We should listen to them muttering to themselves for the first four hours. The bugs they attribute to their own incompetence; the confusing usability issues they never report… and now imagine sitting next to a newbie looking at our code, trying to find their way. No comments. No helpful guides. The code is the best documentation, some people say. I guess they haven&rsquo;t seen my code. All those readability refactors I didn’t do. All these questions nobody ever asked me. People look at the code and don’t come back.</p>

<p>Those are my free software nightmares when I look at all the things I’ve written with a community of one. 😳</p>

<p>Anyway, I guess what I want to say: if you feel like you write free software for others but nobody joins your community, you are not alone. We are all together in this, alone. 😥</p>

<p>I think the reason for this has to do with how hard it is to understand code by just reading it instead of writing. It’s super hard to get into another code base. And it is hard to write code such that it is a welcoming ramp up. I’d say Emacs is one of the examples where it worked but we don’t actually know whether the approach is “good”. I certainly used Emacs for a year or two before writing my own init file way back when.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure which parts enable it and I&rsquo;m not sure if having more of the same would result in more programmers modifying the code and sharing their modifications.</p>

<ul>
<li>Good documentation of the programming language, Emacs Lisp</li>
<li>Good documentation of the software itself, Emacs</li>
<li>Good documentation of the code, with documentation strings and comments throughout the code base</li>
</ul>

<p>Nearly every function is documented, nearly every global variable is documented, the concepts are documented in the manual, the language is documented in the manual – it&rsquo;s a gigantic group effort to build that ramp.</p>

<p>I think this is how you get started modifying Emacs: with an init file that customizes some part of it.</p>

<p>That reminds me of the post by Peter Seibel (2014) that I recently saw linked in my feed:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It was sometime after that presentation that I finally realized the obvious: code is not literature. We don’t read code, we decode it. We examine it. A piece of code is not literature; it is a specimen. Knuth said something that should have pointed me down this track when I asked him about his own code reading: … He’s not describing reading literature; he’s describing a scientific investigation.&rdquo; – <a href="https://gigamonkeys.com/code-reading/">Code is not literature</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I feel this is how I approach new code: find a tiny task and see whether I can make that change. Usually this requires building the code, searching the best location, learning about the code style, investigating the libraries used, and so on. There are many strings attached.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know how else to do it.</p>

<p>The same is true at the office. Our code base is about four million lines of code. Newbies get assigned small issues to fix and need to ask a gazillion questions and that&rsquo;s how they learn.</p>

<p>If only there were a better way. If there is, I don&rsquo;t know it.</p>

<p><a class="account" href="https://merveilles.town/@akkartik" title="@akkartik@merveilles.town">@akkartik</a> linked a guest post on their blog (2018):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We all read code already; it’s just that we usually read when we want to edit. And the <em>comprehension</em> that questions about reading are really concerned with—it comes from both reading and writing, interleaved in complex ways. That hacking produces better comprehension than passive, linear reading fits with what we know about learning. – <a href="https://akkartik.name/post/comprehension">Nobody&rsquo;s just reading your code</a>, by <a href="https://stephenmalina.com/">Stephen Malina</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p><a class="account" href="https://merveilles.town/@akkartik" title="@akkartik@merveilles.town">@akkartik</a> summary of our little interchange gives me pause:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We live in a world where everybody is illiterate, unable to read computer programs. Everybody. A tiny minority can <em>write</em> programs, but even they can&rsquo;t read programs written by others without 1000x effort. They/we oppress the rest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed, how not to be part of this, I wonder.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Programming">#Programming</a></p>

<p><strong>2024-06-07</strong>. <a class="account" href="https://idiomdrottning.org/users/Sandra" title="@Sandra@idiomdrottning.org">@Sandra</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think “programming for the household” is actually awesome. Automating our <em>own</em> lives, autonomously, not squeezing our lives into someone else’s automation. – <a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/code-for-yourself">There’s no shame in programming for yourself</a></p>

<hr />
<h2>Let's start from the basics: can you introduce yourself?</h2>
<p>My name is JF Martin, a.k.a. Numeric Citizen in the digital space. I'm 56 years old. I live in Montreal, Canada. I’m a French Canadian. I have a master’s degree in computer science (1993). My research field was user experience and user interface quality assessment. I credit my passion for Apple for this choice of research field because at that time, in 1990-1993, there was a hot debate about which was better, the PC or the Mac, and I advocated for better user interfaces. I’ve been working in the information technology field for thirty years. I wrote about that <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/celebrating-reflecting-on-my-30-years-career-in-it/">here</a>. My first job was to work for an Apple dealer. I eventually moved to a more traditional IT type of work, doing things in IT infrastructures, first with PC deployments in small and medium enterprises, then in data center related technologies deployment and management.</p>
<p>Apple played a significant influence in my life since 1983. I have always preferred creative people and Apple has attracted them more than any other computer brand. I always felt at home in this user community, even though I'm a rather analytic guy professionally. Yet, I consider myself a compulsive creator. Creating something has always been part of my life. When I was a young boy, I was building something with Legos. Then, it was replaced with photography. Then, computers came to my life, first with a Commodore and then with an Apple Macintosh in 1985. Since then, computers, i.e. the Mac, the iPad, have always been central to any creative project. One of them being an indie iOS developer from 2009 to 2013 when I was developing apps for the iPhone. Since then, I mostly spend my time as a blogger and a writer. Photography is also one of my creative hobbies, and you can find my work here on <a href="https://pixelfed.social/numericcitizen">Pixelfed</a> and <a href="https://glass.photo/numericcitizen">Glass</a>. </p>
<h2>What's the story behind your blog?</h2>
<p>First, let’s clear something out of the way: using the Numeric Citizen name. To me, Numeric Citizen was evocative of a citizen living in cyberspace, sharing things with it, learning things from it, etc. I thought it was a good parallel with real-world citizenship. But eventually, I found out that in English, the more frequent word for this would have been “Digital Citizen”, but I couldn’t get the right domain name for it, and it was too late, so I decided to keep the Numeric Citizen moniker.</p>
<p>Now, about my blog. Well, I have a few blogs and websites. Four, to be precise. But let’s go back in time. In 1994, I had a Mac and created a website about meteorology. It was a science-related educative project. This lasted a couple of years. Next, in 2006, I experimented with Apple iWeb, part of the iLife suite. Sadly, I can’t remember what my website was about, but I do remember that I preferred the version of Apple where RSS was still a thing in Safari and iWeb let anyone own a blog for a MobileMe subscription. It’s too bad that Apple dropped iWeb.</p>
<p>I started blogging in 2009 using Google’s Blogger platform. This time, it was about sharing my experiences and discoveries while developing apps for the iPhone. Eventually, I stopped doing that and kept the blog running until 2013. That was it for Blogger. Then, in 2015, I went back to blogging, this time on <a href="http://wordpress.com/">WordPress.com</a>, and it was a more general-purpose blog where I was sharing my thoughts about Apple, among other things. Since then, I’ve been writing about Apple, technology, and photography. Last year, I completed a migration out of <a href="http://wordpress.com/">WordPress.com</a> to <a href="http://ghost.org/">Ghost.org</a>. I couldn’t be happier. Ghost is much simpler to use and manage (no plugins!). But that’s not all. Starting in 2018, I opened a blog on Micro.blog. Since then, I’ve been blogging regularly, and I love it. My website on Ghost is more dedicated to long-form articles, which require more research and writing work. My blog on Micro.blog is about sharing short thoughts and comments about the same subjects. </p>
<p>I often consider myself a digital nomad (or a numeric nomad?). I frequently try different things and don’t hesitate to move from one place to another if I see better value and functionality. Last year, I was really on the move, but I think I will settle for a while once I finish my migration from SmugMug to PixelFed.</p>
<h2>What does your creative process look like when it comes to blogging?</h2>
<p>I’m a highly iterative type of guy. I rarely start writing an article and finish it in one stretch. It’s way too demanding for me. I have a few parallel ongoing research and writing projects and do round-robin writing across them. I'm using Craft Docs for most of my writing needs, an app I love dearly. I developed a rather sophisticated template for my research needs. This template helps me organize my research and support my writing efforts with Craft. When I’m ready to publish, I export to Ulysses, do the final proofing using Grammarly, select the destination and hit publish. I wish I could do all this from Craft, but it’s currently impossible.</p>
<p>Inspiration comes without warning. I often go for a walk and think about so many things. I usually come back with an idea about a new article or a tweak to my creative workflows and start working on it as soon as possible. My creative hobby is what makes me thrive in life. Without it, the last three years with the COVID pandemic would have been so hard on me.</p>
<p>I write a lot about my creative process and the tools that I use all the time. Occasionally, I’ll share an update about my creative workflow when there are enough changes to it. You can read about my last update right <a href="https://world.numericcitizen.io/content-creator-workflow-update-as-of-2023-11">here</a>. These articles are posted on what I call: a blog about blogging. It is currently available as a series of shared documents built-in Craft, but I recently started re-publishing them on a <a href="https://meta.numericcitizen.me/">new Micro.blog website</a> so that I could let people follow my updates using RSS, which Craft doesn't support.</p>
<h2>Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe the physical space influences your creativity?</h2>
<p>My creative environment is relatively simple: my home. I do like to go to coffee shops. I <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/on-creative-work-in-a-coffee-shop/">wrote about these</a>.  I also love to write on my terrasse outside during summer. Bird noises and the wind are indeed delightful while writing. The best triggers for my creativity come down to the time of the day. I love working early in the morning and during the weekends. At night or late in the evening, I’m less into it and find it hard to focus. One thing is clear: many of my ideas come when I do something other than creating, like while taking a walk or... taking my shower. 😅</p>
<h2>A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your tech stack?</h2>
<p>I depend on three hosting solutions: Ghost, Micro.blog, and Craft Docs. I don’t self-host anything. I don’t have time for that (and I’m probably too old, too). At some point, I contemplated the idea of self-hosting a Hugo instance, but when I started to dig a bit into Hugo’s inner workings, I quickly changed my mind. I’m a « SaaS » type of guy, I guess. </p>
<p>My main domain name is “<a href="http://numericcitizen.me/">numericcitizen.me</a>” and I use a subdomain for each of my publishing space or “channel”. Publishing on Ghost goes to “<a href="http://numericcitizen.me/">numericcitizen.me</a>”, but sharing on Micro.blog goes to <a href="https://blog.numericcitizen.me/">blog.numericcitizen.me</a> while my metablog goes to <a href="https://meta.numericcitizen.me/">meta.numericcitizen.me</a>. Photos shared on Pixelfed photos can be seen by visiting <a href="https://photos.numericcitizen.me/">photos.numericcitizen.me</a>.You get the idea. I have so many small websites (too many?) and so I created a hub page that can be reached via, you guessed it, <a href="https://hub.numericcitizen.me/">hub.numericicitizen.me</a>. The latter is hosted on Micro.blog.</p>
<p>But what about newsletters for those who prefer the email experience? I tried Substack and was happy with it until I wasn’t. I tried Buttondown but eventually settled on Ghost. It was one of the many reasons I decided to leave WordPress behind. Under Substack, I used to have the <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/numeric-citizen-introspection-24/">Introspection newsletter</a>, which wasn't about introspection but rather a collection of thoughts and links divided into sections. I stopped publishing this newsletter in September 2022. One year later, I started a new one covering <a href="https://numericcitizen.me/my-weekly-creative-summary-for-the-week-of-2024-08/">my creative week</a>. And I hope to continue publishing this one for a long time because of the pleasure I get while putting it together.</p>
<h2>Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would you do anything differently?</h2>
<p>It’s a hard question. We can always do things differently but the way I see it is simple: my current state is essentially the culmination of all my past experiences, good or bad. It’s an infinite learning process, always feeding the future “me”. </p>
<p>I often wonder if a single “big” website would be better than having so many small ones. I could achieve similar results by using categories and tags with each post. But in the end, I prefer dedicated and more focused but connected silos.</p>
<p>Regarding RSS feeds, I wish I had known about FeedPress earlier so that my readers wouldn’t have to change their subscriptions each time I moved my stuff from one place to another. It’s a great way to centralize feeds from different places where I publish content. Someone can subscribe to my megafeed to see everything I share online.</p>
<p>I wish I had done one thing: each time I made a significant design change to one of my websites or moved from one platform to another, I wish I had kept a screenshot of the previous design. I don't have a visual memory of my journey as a blogger. I find this a bit sad. </p>
<p>And yes, I still prefer Digital Citizen over Numeric Citizen. 🤷🏻‍♂️</p>
<h2>Financial question since the web is obsessed with money: how much does it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost or does it generate some revenue? And what's your position on people monetising personal blogs?</h2>
<p>Ghost isn’t exactly cheap (300$ per year), but their support is stellar. Micro.blog is a bargain (120$ per year) for everything you get. Craft is rather a cheap option, too (at 116$ per year) if you do more than note-taking with it, which I do. All in all, if you do the math, my online presence comes at a cost. I’ll let you do the math. I didn’t count domain name registration and other stuff like apps and other services making <a href="https://world.numericcitizen.io/meta-toolset">my digital toolset</a>. You can see the full details right <a href="https://crafted.numericcitizen.me/current-subscriptions">here</a>, on my “Subscriptions" page. </p>
<p>Now, I want to share a few words about monetization possibilities. I have tried many times, and it’s tough. Over the years, I slowly learned that when someone shows support with a subscription to my website or sends me money, I consider this a gift. Visitors to my main website on Ghost can subscribe for free or pay a small fee to show appreciation. That’s about it. I don’t make money with my YouTube channel because I haven’t met the requirements yet. I'm looking to make money there. I did receive some money via PayPal once or twice. I wasn't expecting that. It's cool. I said a big thank you. </p>
<h2>Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth checking out? And also, who do you think I should be interviewing next?</h2>
<p>I think you should give a try with <a href="https://maique.eu/about/">Maique</a>. He’s from Portugal. He is passionate about photography and shares a lot of creative content on different platforms, mostly open ones. I think he could share a lot as a blogger who constantly tries new things. We're cosmic brothers.</p>
<h2>Final question: is there anything you want to share with us?</h2>
<p>Oh, did I mention my YouTube channel? It’s a complement to my blogs. I know I’m spread everywhere, but it is still manageable. You can find it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/numericcitizenvideos">here</a>. I also have a podcast because I wanted to test the medium, and I quite like it, too, but I don’t produce new episodes often enough. And yes, I’m an amateur photographer with a Glass <a href="https://glass.photo/numericcitizen">profile</a>. I don’t read books. I don’t play games, but I prefer experimenting with modern media (words, audio, video, images).</p>

## Genesis: the country and the city

date: 2024-06-07, from: Ayjay blog

Raymond Williams, in his great The Country and the City, shows how ancient this contrast is, and how standardized its terms are. The contrast is almost always between (a) the innocence and simplicity of the countryside and (b) the noisy corruption of the city. Juvenal begins his third Satire thus: Quid Romae faciam? mentiri nescio [&#8230;]

## How to converse online

date: 2024-06-06, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>The web is, at its core, a conversation tool. At least for the most part. You can have a conversation synchronously via chats and DMs, you can have a conversation semi-synchronously via posts on social media and forums, and you can have a conversation asynchronously using emails or blog posts. The vast majority of what’s happening on the web is a conversation of some sort.</p>
<p>Over the past few weeks, this topic of online conversations managed to find its way over and over again in my brain. What’s the ideal workflow for a good online conversation? I’m currently typing these words and I’m talking to nobody. I don’t have an imaginary audience and I usually assume that nobody will read these words even though I know for a fact that some of you do. And yet, more often than not these posts I write end up being excellent conversation starters. But what’s the best way to have that conversation? I defaulted to email for pretty much all my interactions even though some people do ping me via Apple Messages every now and again. Is this arrangement ideal? Is email the best tool to have these conversations? I honestly don’t know. I do know that so far I haven’t found a better alternative.</p>
<p>Is this workflow ideal? I write something, you read it on the site, in your RSS reader, or in your inbox, you send me an email, I reply to you and off we go? Those are a lot of steps and there’s substantial friction involved. You need to decide to send me an email, hunt for my email address, write something, and overcome the weirdness of sending an email to a stranger. It’s a lot. Wouldn’t it be a lot easier to leave a quick comment? Shouldn’t I have comments on my site? Well, no. Comments are easily one of the worst ways to have meaningful conversations online. I’m not saying it’s impossible to have a smart, thoughtful conversation in a comment section, I’m just saying it’s bloody hard. Comments are performative. You write knowing the other people will see your comment and so it’s not just a conversation between you and me. It’s a conversation between you, me, and the countless other people who will stumble on this page at any point in time.</p>
<p>When it comes to conversations, the location matters. It matters in the real world and it matters in the digital world. Do you know how many people have sent me awful, nasty emails in the past 7 years, since I started this blog? Exactly zero. I’m aware that now that I said it someone will do it just to be the first but still, my point stands. Since an email is private people don’t usually bother because it takes time and effort and there’s no reward at the end. They won’t get to see my reaction, people won’t add a +1 to a like or a whatever to their comment. The private space of an email conversation matters, it matters a lot.</p>
<p>Another thing that matters is intentions. I recently removed from this site the integration with webmention.io to receive webmentions from other sites. Why? Well, because as much as I like and approve the idea behind the concept of a webmention I also think that taking the time matters. Taking 20 seconds to send an email to say “Hey, I wrote something and I quoted something you wrote” has a lot more value in my world than configuring a server to automatically send a ping towards my server. I know most people won’t bother doing that and that’s fine. I honestly prefer to not know, I prefer to not receive all those automated pings and live in ignorance.</p>
<p>I obviously don’t have an answer to the question I’m asking in this post. I don’t know what’s the best way to have a conversation online. What I do know is that a good conversation takes time and effort. It takes willingness to engage and it takes honesty. But they’re rewarding. Good conversations are incredibly rewarding. I encourage you to try. Try emailing the people behind the sites you read. Try to get in touch. See what happens. Most won’t reply, and that’s fine. It happens. But some will. And you never know what can happen.</p>                <hr>

## OSNews needs your help to stay alive

date: 2024-06-06, from: OS News

As some of you will know, I recently started working on OSNews as my full-time job, and that means I sometimes need to be annoying and remind you all that I need your help in keeping the website going. Ad income has been going down the drain for years and years now, so your support is crucial in keeping OSNews online. We&#8217;ve been providing you with the latest technology news for over 25 years now, and I&#8217;d really like to keep things going for another 25 years. So, how can you help? You can become an OSNews Patreon, which will remove ads from OSNews, and give you a little bit of flair on every comment you post to show off that you support us. We offer three pricing tiers with an increasing level of prominence for your flair, with the highest tier giving you the option of choosing your own flair to really show off to your fellow readers and commenters that you are just a little bit more equal than everyone else. You can also make individual donations through Ko-Fi. Since I really need to replace the monitor of my OSNews workstation &#8211; after eight years of loyal use, the cheap monitor is started to show ghosting and flickering, and I feel like it could give out at any moment &#8211; I&#8217;ve set a goal on Ko-Fi for this very purpose. I don&#8217;t expect this goal to be met any time soon, but it&#8217;s a nice target to aim for and look forward to. I intend to replace the old 4K display with the cheapest 4K/144Hz panel I can find here in Sweden, but since that will most likely be unrealistic price-wise, the goal is rooted more in aspiration than reality. There are other ways to support us too &#8211; you can make a donation through Liberapay, or go to our merch store and buy T-shirts, mugs, and other cool items. The ultimate goal that I&#8217;m working towards is to eventually be able to offer ad-free by default, fully supported by you, our generous readers. This is a long-term goal and not something we&#8217;ll achieve overnight, but I want to maintain OSNews&#8217; independence at all costs. Virtually every other technology news site you visit is part of a major media empire, such as The Verge or Ars Technica, with huge amounts of staff and massive funds backing them &#8211; and all the questionable relationships between writers and the technology companies that entails. Add to it the rise of artificial intelligence and the negative consequences that&#8217;s going to have, and the need for independent, reader-funded technology websites is greater than ever. That being said, we will not be gating content behind paywalls, so even if you cannot or are unwilling to support us, you will still get all the same content as everyone else. As such, supporting OSNews financially is entirely optional, and will not degrade your experience in any way. Still, OSNews&#8217; continued existence is entirely dependent on me being able to generate enough income through it, so while you do not have to support us, it&#8217;s definitely needed.

And the UI couldn't be simpler. Take the screen shot at paste it into the box where you normally type. It starts analyzing before you press Enter.

## A BSD person tries Alpine Linux

date: 2024-06-06, from: OS News

I’ve barely scratched the surface, but there’s enough here for me to seriously consider a switch to it as my primary Linux distro for testing and servers. I love that htop(1) and lsof(1) only shows a small list of recognisable processes, that it uses OpenRC, that package management seems straight forward, and that it’s so simple to configure. I’ve wondered what a modern, functional “Occam’s Linux” would look like. This is it. ↫ Ruben Schade Alpine is very popular among people inclined towards BSD, but who still want to run Linux as well &#8211; and it&#8217;s easy to see why when you try it out or read about it.

## They’re putting “AI” in your BIOS

date: 2024-06-06, from: OS News

You know what could really use a dose of &#8220;AI&#8221;? Your BIOS. aiBIOS leverages an LLM to integrate AI capabilities into Insyde Software’s flagship firmware solution, InsydeH2O® UEFI BIOS. It provides the ability to interpret the PC user’s request, analyze their specific hardware, and parse through the LLM’s extensive knowledge base of BIOS and computer terminology to make the appropriate changes to the BIOS Setup. This breakthrough technology helps address a major hurdle for PC users that require or desire changes to their BIOS Setup for their personal computers but do not fully understand the meaning of the settings available to them. ↫ Insyde press release Google told users to put glue on pizzas and eat rocks, so I&#8217;m sure the combined efforts of a BIOS maker will surely not pose any problems when automatically changing BIOS settings based on the requests of users who do not really understand what they&#8217;re doing. This surely is a recipe for success, and I can&#8217;t wait to tell my BIOS to enable XMP, only for it to disable hyperthreading, change the boot order to only allow booting from the non-existent floppy drive, and to force the use of the integrated GPU when I&#8217;m actually using a dedicated one. This is going to be just fine.

## Windows Recall demands an extraordinary level of trust that Microsoft hasn’t earned

date: 2024-06-06, from: OS News

The short version is this: In its current form, Recall takes screenshots and uses OCR to grab the information on your screen; it then writes the contents of windows plus records of different user interactions in a locally stored SQLite database to track your activity. Data is stored on a per-app basis, presumably to make it easier for Microsoft’s app-exclusion feature to work. Beaumont says “several days” of data amounted to a database around 90KB in size. In our usage, screenshots taken by Recall on a PC with a 2560×1440 screen come in at 500KB or 600KB apiece (Recall saves screenshots at your PC&#8217;s native resolution, minus the taskbar area). Recall works locally thanks to Azure AI code that runs on your device, and it works without Internet connectivity and without a Microsoft account. Data is encrypted at rest, sort of, at least insofar as your entire drive is generally encrypted when your PC is either signed into a Microsoft account or has Bitlocker turned on. But in its current form, Beaumont says Recall has “gaps you can drive a plane through” that make it trivially easy to grab and scan through a user’s Recall database if you either (1) have local access to the machine and can log into any account (not just the account of the user whose database you’re trying to see), or (2) are using a PC infected with some kind of info-stealer virus that can quickly transfer the SQLite database to another system. ↫ Andrew Cunningham at Ars Technica It really does seem Recall is kind of a mess in the security department, and it has a certain rushed quality about it. All the screenshots are saved in an AppData folder, and data pulled from those screenshots is stored in a local SQLite database that happens to be entirely unencrypted. TotalRecall, a tool developed by Alexander Hagenah, will neatly pull the data from Recall for you without any hassle or issues. This truly is a security nightmare. Aside from all the obvious issues this presents, such as making it even easier for law enforcement to gain access to pretty much everything you do online, something especially troubling for minorities or in countries with less-than-stellar police departments, Recall also presents a whole host of other problems. Imagine being in an abusive relationship, and the abusive partner demanding Recall be left on at all times to exert even more control. Imagine an unscrupulous employee abusing Recall to steal sensitive information from a company for a competitor. Imagine living in some backwards part of a country with controlling religious parents, and you happen to be gay. The problems here are endless. The fact you can turn Recall off doesn&#8217;t mean much, since in the above examples, turning it off is not an option since there are controlling people involved who will demand you keep it on. Browser history and other forms of history in your computer exist as well, of course, but they&#8217;re not always as easy to parse, they&#8217;re easier to manipulate, sanitise, and temporarily hide. Recall just combines all of this and puts a neat little bow on it, ready to be abused by anyone with bad intentions. Recall is ill-conceived, badly implemented, and a solution looking for a problem, that in an of itself creates tons of other problems. I hope Microsoft reconsiders, but in a world where &#8220;AI&#8221; makes investors go nuts, I doubt we&#8217;ll see a sudden sense of clarity coming out of Redmond.

## What We Learned from a Year of Building with LLMs (Part III): Strategy

date: 2024-06-06, from: O'Reilly Radar

We&#160;previously shared&#160;our insights on the&#160;tactics&#160;we have honed while operating LLM applications. Tactics are granular: they are the specific actions employed to achieve specific objectives. We&#160;also shared&#160;our perspective on operations: the higher-level processes in place to support tactical work to achieve objectives. But where do those objectives come from? That is the domain of&#160;strategy. Strategy answers [&#8230;]

## EU data protection board says ChatGPT still not meeting data accuracy standards

date: 2024-06-05, from: OS News

OpenAI&#8217;s efforts to produce less factually false output from its ChatGPT chatbot are not enough to ensure full compliance with European Union data rules, a&#160;task force&#160;at the EU&#8217;s privacy watchdog said. &#8220;Although the measures taken in order to comply with the transparency principle are beneficial to avoid misinterpretation of the output of ChatGPT, they are not sufficient to comply with the data accuracy principle,&#8221; the task force said in a report released on its website on Friday. ↫ Tassilo Hummel at Reuters I&#8217;m glad at least some authorities are taking the wildly inaccurate nonsense outputs of many &#8220;AI&#8221; tools seriously. I&#8217;m not entirely sure when a tool like ChatGPT can be considered &#8220;accurate&#8221;, but whatever it is now, is not it.

## GNU Nano gains optional modern keybindings

date: 2024-06-05, from: OS News

GNU Nano, by far my favourite text editor when using the command line, released version 8.0 recently &#8211; and by recently I mean a month ago &#8211; and in it, there&#8217;s a pretty interesting additional feature that should make using Nano a little bit more straightforward for those not used to its key combinations. Command-line option &#8211;modernbindings (-/) makes ^Q quit, ^X cut, ^C copy, ^V paste, ^Z undo, ^Y redo, ^O open a file, ^W write a file, ^R replace, ^G find again, ^D find again backwards, ^A set the mark, ^T jump to a line, ^P show the position, and ^E execute. ↫ GNU Nano&#8217;s news page Basically, this option makes Nano&#8217;s key bindings a bit more in line with what you might expect as someone coming from a graphical environment. Of course, Nano&#8217;s keybindings are listed at the bottom of its user interface, but it&#8217;s still nice to have the option of making them more in line with the wider computing world. Instead of using the command-line option, you can also change the name of Nano&#8217;s executable, or a symlink to it, to start with &#8220;e&#8221;.

They could be playing the same role that the 12 jurors in NYC did. I'd love to see a requirement that every moderator of a major news show in the US do jury duty for a couple of weeks a year, to keep them aware of the standard that should also apply to news, not just justice.

## AMD drops Windows 10 support for new chipsets and processors, while Microsoft expands testing efforts for new Windows 10 features

date: 2024-06-05, from: OS News

Remember when I said the honeymoon with AMD&#8217;s consumer-friendly chipset and socket support policy would eventually end? Well, while this is not exactly that, it will make a lot of people very unhappy. While AMD, as does any other company, was boastful about its product touting the 16% IPC boost on Zen 5 and the big AI performance leap delivering up to 50 TOPS on the NPU side, an interesting drawback of the Ryzen AI 300 series that has managed to avoid getting media attention is the lack of support for Windows 10. While this was just an unconfirmed rumour last month even though it was suggested by a supposed Lenovo China manager, we have now got confirmation from AMD itself that the report, that Strix point and newer CPUs and APUs will not support Windows 10 is true. ↫ Sayan Sen at NeoWin Official support for Windows 10 is ending next year, so there is some reason to AMD&#8217;s madness, but at the same time, almost 70% of Windows users are currently using Windows 10, and leaving those users behind might not be the best idea AMD ever had. There is an argument to be made that at least a reasonable number of these people are still using Windows 10 not out of their own volition, but because of Microsoft&#8217;s strict hardware requirements, and as such, anyone buying a new AMD machine will just opt for the latest version of Windows out of habit, but I still think there&#8217;s a sizable contingent of people who actively choose Windows 10 over 11 for a whole host of reasons. On a strongly related note, despite 2025 marking the end of regular support for Windows 10, Microsoft yesterday announced it&#8217;s expanding the the number of Insider channels for new Windows 10 features from one to two, adding a Beta tier below the existing Release Preview tier. Microsoft, too, will have to come to terms with the fact that with 70% of Windows users using Windows 10, they might not even be able to drop support for the operating system as early as next year. While this 70% number will surely slowly decrease over the next 12 months, with many people simply being unable to upgrade due to hardware limitations, I have a suspicion we might see an extension on that 2025 date.

## Our First Transformer of the Month: Matt Dosberg

It is impossible to pinpoint a single, static definition of what makes a “Digital Transformer.” Although Matt Dosberg’s official title is Digital Transformation and IT Innovation Lead for Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), his full contributions to NASA require a lengthier description.

## Genesis: fertility

date: 2024-06-05, from: Ayjay blog

If the defining axes of Genesis 1–11 were making/naming and commanding/disobeying, those of the Patriarchal narratives are fertility/barrenness and pastoral/urban. Over and over again the LORD promises fertility to the barren, and to the childless a multitude of descendants. The primary sign of the LORD’s covenant with the children of Abraham is circumcision, the marking [&#8230;]

## 2024-06-01 Fonts are important

date: 2024-06-04, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-06-01-fonts-are-important">2024-06-01 Fonts are important</h1>

<p>I was thinking about writing a simple editor again. The <a href="https://smallandnearlysilent.com/">Small and Nearly Silent</a> web app by <a class="account" href="https://tenforward.social/@eli_oat" title="@eli_oat@tenforward.social">@eli_oat</a> is beautiful because it mixes text and line drawings. I often feel that I&rsquo;d like a simple path-based SVG-like drawing ability, like <a href="https://akkartik.name/lines.html">lines</a>, by <a class="account" href="https://merveilles.town/@akkartik" title="@akkartik@merveilles.town">@akkartik</a>. Some lines, some control points, some curves, filling stuff with patterns… I don&rsquo;t know whether I&rsquo;d actually use it, but it&rsquo;s alluring.</p>

<p>The whole <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/uxn.html">uxn</a> ecosystem with many different small tools is also quite alluring. Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s also a bit hard to get into an existing ecosystem like that. I still feel that if spent a while writing something myself, it&rsquo;d feel more like it was &ldquo;mine&rdquo;. I&rsquo;d just understand it better. I just don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m ready to spend that much time on it, or if I&rsquo;d even be able to pull it off. So that&rsquo;s why I wavering at the same time that I&rsquo;m fascinated.</p>

<p>Given all that, I was thinking about Gforth and found <a href="https://github.com/JeremiahCheatham/Gforth-SDL2-Bindings/">SDL2 Bindings for Gforth</a>, and I found the example <a href="https://github.com/JeremiahCheatham/Yellow-Snow">Yellow Snow</a> game using this library, I tried to compile it and Gforth complained about the missing headers. No problem, I thought to myself. I know what to do: <code>sudo apt install libsdl2-ttf-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev</code> – but the mixer results in <a href="https://doc.sccode.org/">SuperCollider</a> getting deinstalled. Oh no!</p>

<p>So now I&rsquo;m once again thinking about the thing I actually want to do. Do I want to build an Emacs light? A simple line-based text editor like <code>ed</code> but with more features? An editor that only runs inside a terminal, like <code>kilo</code> or <code>mini</code>? See <a href="2018-03-12_Writing_an_Editor">2018-03-12 Writing an Editor</a> for more. Or would it be an editor with a GUI? Would it work only with X11? Or would it be based on SDL?</p>

<p>I feel like an editor with a minimal GUI would be nice. I don&rsquo;t think I need a menu, but I think I&rsquo;d like a way to scale font size up and down, UTF-8 support to write German and Portuguese, basically render Markdown and some simple variant of SVG, inline. I feel like that&rsquo;s why I need to start with graphics and font support. Otherwise I&rsquo;ll end up with something like <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~m15o/grid/">grid</a>: a cool <a href="https://plan9.io/wiki/plan9/using_acme/index.html">ACME</a>-inspired text editor, but it would only really works for English.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Editor">#Editor</a></p>

<p><strong>2024-06-04</strong>. Thinking about Go and the <a href="https://github.com/hibiken/mini">mini</a> editor.
It runs in a terminal. So what would it take to turn it into a graphical editor with fonts, ligatures, bidirectional text, font-sizes, and all of that?</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/go-text/typesetting">go-text/typesetting</a> is a library that&rsquo;s used by <a href="https://fyne.io">Fyne</a>, <a href="https://gioui.org">Gio</a>, and <a href="https://ebitengine.org">Ebitengine</a>. So perhaps one of these frameworks?</p>

<p>Fyne has a <a href="https://apps.fyne.io/apps/com.fynelabs.notes.html">Notes</a> example application.
It looks like a nice, simple app. When I built it, however, it didn&rsquo;t work.
Is it because I&rsquo;m on Wayland? I don&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>Gio is used by <a href="https://anvil-editor.net/">Anvil</a>, an ACME-like editor with many features.
In fact, it already looks like it has too many features for me to start building something.
I wonder. Perhaps those are the right features? I just can&rsquo;t warm up to using the mouse all that much.</p>

<p>Ebitengine has a <a href="https://ebitengine.org/en/examples/font.html">Font</a> example.
It just shows how one loads a font for a number of code-points and that&rsquo;s that.
An interesting way to load a font, for sure.</p>

## Solid State Quantum Magnetometers—Seeking out water worlds from the quantum world

date: 2024-06-04, from: NASA breaking news

“Follow the water!”  The solar system is full of water in different states, from the Sun’s water vapor to the ice of Pluto and beyond. Water is not only linked to the possibility to sustain life, it is also interesting for its own geological properties and potential uses. For example, ice on the Moon and Mars could support human exploration. Comets that hit Earth may have deposited water on our planet. The icy comets and rings of Saturn reveal how solar systems change over time.

## Intel unveils Lunar Lake architecture, moves RAM on-die

date: 2024-06-04, from: OS News

Hot on the heels of AMD, here&#8217;s Intel&#8217;s next-generation processor, this time for the laptop market. Overall, Lunar Lake represents their second generation of disaggregated SoC architecture for the mobile market, replacing the Meteor Lake architecture in the lower-end space. At this time, Intel has disclosed that it uses a 4P+4E (8 core) design, with hyper-threading/SMT disabled, so the total thread count supported by the processor is simply the number of CPU cores, e.g., 4P+4E/8T. ↫ Gavin Bonshor at AnandTech The most significant change in Lunar Lake, however, has nothing to do with IPC improvements, core counts, or power usage. No, the massive sea change here is that Lunar Lake will do away with separate memory sticks, instead opting for on-die memory at a maximum of 32GB LPDDR5X. This is very similar to how Apple packages its memory on the M dies, and yes, this also means that as far as thin Intel laptops go, you&#8217;ll no longer be able to upgrade your memory after purchase. You choose your desired amount of memory at purchase, and that&#8217;s what you&#8217;ll be stuck with. Buyer beware, I suppose. We can only hope Intel isn&#8217;t going to default to 8GB.

## A brief look at the 3DS cartridge protocol

date: 2024-06-04, from: OS News

About a week ago, there has been a little addition to the 3dbrew wiki page about 3DS cartridges (carts) that outlines the technical details of how the 3DS cartridge controller and a 3DS cartridge talk to each other. I would like to take this opportunity to also include the 3DS itself in the conversation to illuminate which part of which device performs which step. I will then proceed to outline where I think the corresponding design decisions originate. Finally, I will conclude with some concrete ideas for improvement. ↫ Forbidden Tempura Everything you ever wanted to know about 3DS cartridges and how they interact with the 3DS.

In other words the designers of CSS and JavaScript and probably every other technology everyone uses had no idea what actual developers were doing with their committee-designed creation. They made mistakes and piled them on each other, fixing old mistakes with new mistakes. After 30 years of evolving in this convoluted way, if you want to create useful software, you have to either master all of it (and no one has) or pay $20 a month to OpenAI so you can use it to navigate the awful hairball that the web platform has become. Where we only have a sliver of knowledge as humans, <i>the machine knows all of it.</i> And that's just programming. I'm just guessing that everything is that way. You know the <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/6c5a6426-62f9-48c1-9995-b4ae6f808907">part</a> in The Matrix Reloaded where we're told <a href="https://youtu.be/Ny_mr3QX9Q8?si=7GMMS7dBvZW5cOag&t=165">no one knows</a> how the technology works. That's where we are now. Spend your whole life using the stuff and you still only know a tiny fraction of what you need to make good software. We needed what ChatGPT does, but we didn't know we needed it. That's where we are now, and the journos are sitting on the sidelines hurling <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Make-Spitballs">spitballs</a> at it.

What got me spinning was listening to Rachel Maddow advertise her podcast at the beginning of her show last night. You can get the podcast for free, she says, or if you want no ads, you can pay some money and get it from Apple. What Apple is selling there, and Maddow is going along with, is not a freaking podcast and by calling it one they undermine a great medium. I understand why Maddow might not care, she makes millions from a medium that doesn't give users much choice (ie MSNBC) so why should she care about podcasting, which does.

If you have to use Apple, Audible, Spotify or Google to listen to something, that's nice, hope it's good for you, but folks that is not a podcast. Podcasts give you the listener all the power. If you give it up it'll all be Disneyfied before too long. It pisses me off that Amazon Music sends me messages about all the new "podcasts" they have. I mutter under my breath when I hear this, some expletive I'd rather not repeat. Amazon, the users know that podcasting == user choice, and they hate you just a little every time you lie about it. Find another term you like and use that. You have the money to do the marketing. Come on, just once play fair. You'll be surprised how good it feels, and I wouldn't be surprised if the users reward you for it.

It would be nice if it just said "I don't know" but it's early, and they haven't figured out how to do that yet. The journalists have no sense of wonder I guess, or they never thought to use it in their jobs. I can't wait for the first aha! from a journalist -- who will say this: "Aha! Now I see what this is for and it's freaking lovely." But they've decided it sucks and that's that. Too bad, we're going on without them. And thanks to the good moderation tools we can keep the turd-droppers from totally screwing it up.

## Radar Trends to Watch: June 2024

date: 2024-06-04, from: O'Reilly Radar

May was a month of announcements: between Google, Apple, Microsoft, and OpenAI, there was much ado about—well, very little, in fact. It’s always seemed to me that big announcements steal attention that might otherwise go to projects that are less flashy but more deserving. (Or maybe I’m just becoming jaded.) That’s not to say that [&#8230;]

## 2024-05-23 Death and dying

date: 2024-06-04, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-05-23-death-and-dying">2024-05-23 Death and dying</h1>

<p>This is the first time somebody is dying in my close family where I am old enough to be an adult about it.</p>

<p>One of my sisters died when I was about twenty. I was living in Switzerland with my dad, and it was terrible to hear my mom crying at the phone, practically unable to tell me what had happened, to then see my father confused, shocked. I booked a flight for him but didn&rsquo;t go myself. My mom was living in Portugal with my two sisters. I wasn&rsquo;t there for my sister&rsquo;s burial. People had to be buried within 48 hours, back then. I don&rsquo;t know how things are now. There was school and stuff and I had not lived with my sisters for a few years. I didn&rsquo;t feel very close. It just felt weird. I didn&rsquo;t know what it was supposed to mean.</p>

<p>Now, thirty years later, my stepfather is dying. His kidneys are failing, his liver is failing, his lungs are filling up with water, his heart is failing; they can&rsquo;t give him his heart medication because the kidneys are at their limits, can&rsquo;t have him move around because he&rsquo;s weak, and so he&rsquo;s breaking down. I mean, he&rsquo;s calm, he knows what&rsquo;s happening, and he&rsquo;s very, very tired. He&rsquo;s ready to go.</p>

<p>I think that in my heart, I know that this is how it works. We have to go one day. I don&rsquo;t want to spend the last hours hooked up to machines. I&rsquo;ll be very, very tired. I&rsquo;ll just want to go home. I also won&rsquo;t want anybody around me to be sad. Hopefully, I&rsquo;ll feel that I lived a good life, that I had a good time, that the people I spend my time with were decent people, worthy of the short time I was given. I hope that I will be able to let go and be at peace. It&rsquo;s what I hear about my stepfather.</p>

<p>But when I sit in that family video call, with siblings in Portugal and Germany and my mother, and one after another people start crying, choking up, it&rsquo;s hard. It&rsquo;s that invisible choker, grabbing us, one after another.</p>

<p>I need to remember the good times, the conversations we had, the laughter we shared. I need to book a flight and see the rest of our family. All that independence and all that living abroad is coming back to haunt us, now.</p>

<p>To go and support each other.</p>

<p>Go and hug your loved ones.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Family">#Family</a></p>

<p><strong>2024-05-27</strong>. I arrived today. He didn’t look good at all. In fact, he seemed to be barely holding on to life. Sleeping, mostly. Occasionally, gasping for air, staring, maybe recognizing us, saying a word or two. It was heartbreaking. He died the same day. The doctor and the nurse came, two very friendly people. Removed the tubes, stopped the Morphium machine, made his death official.</p>

<p>There were so many tears. A step brother, a half-brother, a half-sister, my sister, my half-brother’s wife, their kid, my mom… the kid was the only one that seemed unperturbed. “Don’t be sad, grandma!”</p>

<p>Later the funerary services came to pick up the body. Again, both of them super nice. We’ll see how things go, tomorrow. My mother is not feeling well. I seem to be doing OK. I can be strong when it’s not my partner that has died.</p>

<p>I’m happy we were all there for him, singing songs, bringing him his birthday cake (he died on his 78th birthday). I’m happy we were all there for each other.</p>

<p><strong>2024-05-28</strong>. Cremation today. The sun is out. People on the radio.</p>

<p><strong>2024-05-30</strong>. On the way home. It was good to see the family again. I gave a little speech in Portuguese, explaining how the language continues to remain important to us, even if we live a abroad, and how hard it was for a family where people live in different countries, alone – but also how our parents divorcing and marrying had led to an ever growing family. There are more parents, more siblings, and I love it and it helps. We can all help each other. And my deceased stepfather was certainly an enrichment for our family, bringing anarchy and lawlessness and laughter into a family that was rigid and regimented and dour, and how we all grew with that and how it was important to remember the good times we had and the lessons we all drew from his presence. Truly, a great influence for all of us.</p>

<p>I still remember how I met him years before my mother met him. He lived across the river alone with his son, wild and free and I was so jealous. I wished to live like that! And then my parents divorced, my dad went back to Switzerland and a year later I followed him and got to live wild and free like them, it was amazing. And one day I came back and there were rumours that our mother had found a boyfriend. Imagine my surprise when it was him, the wild and free guitar playing dude from across the river! And eventually my friend from school turned into my stepbrother, moved in with my mom, lived in my room. It was mysterious and magical and then to see him and his father struggle with my mom, the changes they brought about, it was a miracle.</p>

<p>So, my man, wherever you are, here&rsquo;s to you and your last trip, to your guitars and flutes, your love of music and freedom, your spirit of independence and love of people and aliens. Cheers! I hope to see you again.</p>

## Testing Raspberry Pi's AI Kit - 13 TOPS for $70

<span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Testing Raspberry Pi's AI Kit - 13 TOPS for $70</span>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Raspberry Pi today launched the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-ai-kit-available-now-at-70/">AI Kit</a>, a $70 addon which straps a Hailo-8L on top of a Raspberry Pi 5, using the recently-launched M.2 HAT (the Hailo-8L is of the M.2 M-key variety, and comes preinstalled).</p>

<p><img width="700" height="auto" class="insert-image" src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/pi-ai-kit.jpeg" alt="Raspberry Pi AI Kit"></p>

<p>The Hailo-8L's claim to fame is 3-4 TOPS/W efficiency, which, along with the Pi's 3-4W idle power consumption, puts it alongside Nvidia's edge devices like the Jetson Orin in terms of TOPS/$ and TOPS/W for price and efficiency.</p>

<p>Google's <a href="https://coral.ai">Coral TPU</a> has been a popular choice for a machine learning/AI accelerator for the Pi for years now, but Google seems to have left the project on life support, after the Coral hardware was scalped for a couple years about as badly as the Raspberry Pi itself!</p></div>

## AI as Reality Television

date: 2024-06-04, from: Gary Marcus blog

Perhaps no week of AI drama will ever match the week in which Sam got fired and rehired, but the writers for the AI reality series we are all watching just don&#8217;t quit. For one thing, the bad press about Sam Altman and OpenAI, who once seemingly could do no wrong, just keep coming.

## Rebalancing our REST API traffic

date: 2024-06-04, from: Crossref Blog

<p>Since we first launched our REST API around 2013 as a Labs project, it has evolved well beyond a prototype into arguably Crossref’s most visible and valuable service. It is the result of 20,000 organisations around the world that have worked for many years to curate and share metadata about their various resources, from research grants to research articles and other component inputs and outputs of research.</p>
<p>The REST API is relied on by a large part of the research information community and beyond, seeing around 1.8 billion requests each month. Just five years ago, that average monthly number was 600 million. Our members are the heaviest users, using it for all kinds of information about their own records or picking up connections like citations and other relationships. Databases, discovery tools, libraries, and governments all use the API. Research groups use it for all sorts of things such as analysing trends in science or recording retractions and corrections.</p>
<p>So the chances are high that almost any tool you rely on in scientific research has somewhere incorporated metadata through us.</p>
<h2 id="optimising-performance">Optimising performance</h2>
<p>For some time, we’ve been noticing reduced performance in a number of ways, and periodically we have a flurry of manually blocking/unblocking IP addresses from requesters that are hammering and degrading the service for everyone else, and this is of course only minimally effective and very short term. You can always watch our status page for alerts. This is the current one about REST API performance: <a href="https://status.crossref.org/incidents/d7k4ml9vvswv" target="_blank">https://status.crossref.org/incidents/d7k4ml9vvswv</a>.</p>
<p>As the number of users and requests has grown, our strategies for serving those requests must evolve. This post discusses how we’re approaching balancing the growth in usage for the immediate term and provides some thoughts about things we could try in the future on which we’ll gladly take feedback and advice.</p>
<h3 id="load-balancing">Load balancing</h3>
<p>In 2018, we started routing users through three different pools (<em>public</em>, <em>polite</em>, and <em>plus</em>). This coincided with the launch of <a href="https://www.crossref.org/services/metadata-retrieval/metadata-plus">Metadata Plus</a>, a paid-for service with monthly data dumps and very high rate limits. Note that all metadata is exactly the same and real-time across all pools. We also, more recently, introduced an <em>internal</em> pool. Here&rsquo;s more about them:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Plus</em>: This is the aforementioned premium option; it’s really for ‘enterprise-wide’ use in production services and is not really relevant here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Public</em>: This is the default and is the one that is struggling at the moment. You don’t have to identify yourself and, in theory, we don’t have to work through the night to support it if it’s struggling (although we often do). <em>Public</em> currently receives around <strong>30,000</strong> requests per minute.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Polite</em>: Traffic is routed to <em>polite</em> simply by detecting a mailto in the header. Any system or person including an email is being routed to a currently-quieter pool, this means we can always get in touch for troubleshooting (and only troubleshooting). <em>Polite</em> currently receives around <strong>5,000</strong> requests per minute.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Internal</em>: In 2021, we introduced a new pool just for our own tools where we can control and predict the traffic. <em>Internal</em> currently receives around <strong>1,000</strong> requests per minute.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The volumes of traffic across <em>public</em>, <em>polite</em> and <em>internal</em> pools are very different and yet each pool has always had similar resources. The purpose of each of these pools has been long-established but our efforts to ask the community to use <em>polite</em> by default have not been particularly successful and it is clear that we don’t have the right balance.</p>
<p>The <em>internal</em> pool has been dedicated to our internal services that have predictable usage and that have requests that are not initiated by external users. The <em>internal</em> pool has arbitrarily included reference matching but not Crossmark, Event Data, or search.crossref.org, which all use the <em>polite</em> pool instead, along with the community. We have the capacity on the <em>internal</em> pool to shift all of this “internal” traffic across, and in doing so we will create more capacity for genuine <em>polite</em> users and redefine what we consider to be “internal”.</p>
<p>Creating more capacity on <em>polite</em> will also give us the opportunity to load-balance requests to both <em>polite</em> and <em>public</em> across the two pools. We are at a point where we cannot eke more performance out of the API without architectural changes. In order to buy ourselves time to address this properly, we will modify the routing of <em>polite</em> and <em>public</em> and evenly distribute requests to the two pools 50/50.</p>
<p>The <em>public</em> and <em>polite</em> pools have equal resources at the moment yet handle very different volumes of traffic (30,000 req/min vs 5,000 req/min), and with the proposed changes to internal traffic the <em>polite</em> pool would handle a fraction of this. The result would look something like 31,000 req/min evenly distributed across <em>public</em> and <em>polite</em>.</p>
<h3 id="rate-limiting">Rate limiting</h3>
<p>Our rate-limiting also needs review. We track a number of metrics in our web proxy but only deny requests on one of them - the number of requests per second. On <em>public</em> and <em>polite</em> we limit each IP address to sending 50 req/sec and if this rate is exceeded users are denied access for 10 seconds. These limits are generous and we cannot realistically support this volume of request for all users of the <em>public</em> or <em>polite</em> API.</p>
<p>However, when requests are taking a long time to return, we potentially have a separate problem of high concurrency as hundreds of requests could be sent before the first one has returned. We intend to identify and impose an appropriate rate limit on concurrent requests from each IP to prevent a small number of users from disproportionately affecting all users with long-running queries.</p>
<h3 id="longer-term">Longer-term</h3>
<p>So, in the short-term we will revise our pool traffic as described above. We’ll do that this week. Then we will review the current rate limits and reduce them to something more reasonable for the majority of users. And we’ll identify and introduce a rate limit for concurrent requests from each user.</p>
<p>Longer-term, we need to rearchitect our Elasticsearch pools so that we can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduce shard sizes to improve performance of queries</li>
<li>Balance data shards and replicas more evenly</li>
<li>Optimise our instance types for our workload</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="want-to-help">Want to help?</h2>
<p>Thanks for asking!</p>
<p>Firstly, please, everyone, do always put an email in your API request headers - while the short term plan will help stabilise performance, this habit will always help us troubleshoot e.g. we can always contact you instead of blocking you!</p>
<p>Secondly, we know many of you incorporate Crossref metadata, add lots of value to it in order to deliver important services, and also develop APIs of your own. We’d love any comments or recommendations from those of you handling similar situations on scaling and optimising API performance. You can comment on this post which is managed via our Discourse forum. We’ll also be adding updates to this thread as well as on status.crossref.org. If you’d like to be in touch with any of us directly, all our emails are <a href="mailto:firstinitiallastname@crossref.org">firstinitiallastname@crossref.org</a>.</p>

## Andreas Kling steps down from SerenityOS to focus entirely on the Ladybird browser

date: 2024-06-03, from: OS News

We&#8217;ve got some possibly sad, possibly great news. Today, Andreas Kling, the amazing developer who started SerenityOS as a way to regain a sense or normalcy after completing his drug rehab program, has announced he&#8217;s stepping down as the &#8216;big dictator for life&#8217; of the SerenityOS project, handing leadership over the maintainer group. The other half of the coin, however, is that Kling will officially fork Ladybird, the cross-platform web browser that originated as part of SerenityOS, turning it into a proper, separate project. Personally, for the past two years, I&#8217;ve been almost entirely focused on Ladybird, a new web browser that started as a simple HTML viewer for SerenityOS. When Ladybird became a cross-platform project in 2022, I switched all my attention to the Linux version, as testing on Linux was much easier and didn&#8217;t require booting into SerenityOS. Time flew by, and now I can&#8217;t remember the last time I worked on something in SerenityOS that wasn&#8217;t related to Ladybird. ↫ Andreas Kling If you know a little bit about Kling&#8217;s career, it&#8217;s not entirely surprising that his heart lies with working on a browser engine. He originally worked at Nokia, and then at Apple in San Francisco on WebKit, and there&#8217;s most likely some code that he&#8217;s written in the browser you&#8217;re using right now (except, perhaps, for us Firefox users). As such, it makes sense that once Ladybird grew into something more than just a simple HTML viewer, he&#8217;d be focusing on it a lot. As part of the fork, Ladybird will focus entirely on Linux and macOS, and drop SerenityOS as a target. This may seem weird at first, but this is an entirely amicable and planned step, as this allows Ladybird to adopt, use, and integrate third party code, something SerenityOS does not allow. In addition, many of these open source projects Ladybird couldn&#8217;t really use anyway because they simply didn&#8217;t exist for SerenityOS in the first place. This decision creates a lot of breathing room and flexibility for both projects. Ladybird was getting a lot of attention from outside of SerenityOS circles, from large donations to code contributions. I&#8217;m not entirely surprised by this step, and I really hope it&#8217;s going to be the beginning of something great. We really need new and competitive browser engines to push the web forward, and alongside Servo, it now seems Ladybird has also picked up the baton. What this will mean for SerenityOS remains to be seen. As Kling said, he hasn&#8217;t really been involved with SerenityOS outside of Ladybird work for two years now, so it seems the rest of the contributors were already doing a lot of the heavy lifting. I hope this doesn&#8217;t mean the project will peter out, since it has a certain flair few other operating systems have.

## Redox replaces core applications with COSMIC applications

date: 2024-06-03, from: OS News

Another month, another Redox progress report. The Rust-based operating system, headed by system76 engineer Jeremy Soller, has made a big move by replacing Redox&#8217; Orbital file manager, text editor and terminal by their COSMIC counterparts, COSMIC Files, COSMIC Editor and COSMIC Terminal, in the default Redox installation. COSMIC is the Rust-based desktop environment system76 is currently developing for their Linux distribution, Pop!_OS. You really have to start wondering what the long-term goals for Redox really are here. I&#8217;m not saying they&#8217;re intending to replace Linux with it &#8211; that&#8217;d be suicide &#8211; but the steady progress towards a general purpose operating system is undeniable.

There&#8217;s no denying that not everyone is happy with the state of the GTK world, and I, too, have argued that GNOME&#8217;s massive presence and seeming unwillingness to cooperate with or even consider the existence of other GTK-based desktop environments is doing real, measurable harm to the likes of Xfce, Cinnamon, and others. A major root cause is a feeling that GTK is nothing but a vessel for GNOME, and that the project doesn&#8217;t really seem to care much about anyone else. GNOME Foundation member and all-round very kind person Hari Rana, also known as TheEvilSkeleton, penned a blog post highlighting the other side of the story. In essence, what it comes down to, according to Rana, is that it&#8217;s better for everyone if GNOME-specific widgets are moved out of GTK, and into something else &#8211; first libhandy, and now its succesor libadwaita, splitting the toolkit (GTK) from the design language (libadwaita). This allows GNOME developers to focus on, well, GNOME, and frees up time for GTK developers to focus on generic widgets that aren&#8217;t specific to GNOME. Thanks to the removal of GNOME widgets from GTK 4, GTK developers can continue to work on general-purpose widgets, without being influenced or restricted in any way by the GNOME HIG. Developers of cross-platform GTK 3 apps that rely exclusively on general-purpose widgets can be more confident that GTK 4 won’t remove these widgets, and hopefully enjoy the benefits that GTK 4 offers. ↫ Hari Rana From a GNOME standpoint, this makes perfect sense, and I can obviously see the benefits for them. However, what this entire post seems to ignore is that the main effect of the split between GTK 4 and libadwaita is that various GTK applications, now targeting libadwaita because of GNOME&#8217;s immense popularity, simply no longer integrate very well with other desktops, like Xfce or Cinnamon. GNOME is, of course, under no obligation to remedy this situation, but at the very least they could acknowledge this is a very real problem that their fellow developers working on Xfce, Cinnamon, MATE, and others, have to deal with. It works the other way around too. Developers targeting the Linux desktop, where GNOME is more or less the default, have to choose between making a GTK application that integrates well with GNOME by opting for libadwaita and leaving non-GNOME users with a crappy experience, or opting for &#8216;pure&#8217; GTK 4 and leaving GNOME users with a worse experience. Neither option is good for the Linux desktop as a whole. The very real ripple effects of GNOME&#8217;s choices regarding GTK and libadwaita are seemingly being stubbornly ignored, neglected, and often not even acknowledged at all, and it&#8217;s no surprise this creates an immense amount of friction in the wider desktop Linux community. It just feels smug and careless, and of course that&#8217;s going to rub people the wrong way- regardless of the purity of your intentions.

If you make a podcast client, I'd like to have an <a href="https://opml.org/spec2.opml#subscriptionLists">OPML list</a> of all the feeds I'm subscribed to in my client so I can follow it in my feed reader. I'd really like it to go the other way, actually, so I could maintain the list on my desktop computer, and have it automatically reflected in the mobile podcast client. It's very important that it use OPML, that's the standard for this stuff. I couldn't possibly get excited by another format. Podcasting thrives on these standards. The client I use is <a href="https://pocketcasts.com/">Pocket Casts</a> which is part of Automattic. BTW, you can <a href="https://editsubscriptionlists.opml.org/">use Drummer to edit</a> a subscription list. Its native format is OPML.

It's still working -- people expect to have choice in where they listen to their podcasts, and as long as that's true they will imho continue to have choice. But even if Google took it over tomorrow, I'd be happy with the outcome. It's been over 20 years since we rolled it out, and it's still delivering huge value to lots of people, and isn't controlled by anyone, as far as I can tell there are no gatekeepers. If only we had been able to keep blogging free of that kind of control, but I have hope there too.

## They might not make it

date: 2024-06-03, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>Months ago I ranted about <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/a-rant-on-arc-search">Arc Search</a>. My thoughts on the subject have not changed. Not long after that post, the fun people at The Browser Company released a teaser video for an upcoming 5 video series called “WE MIGHT NOT MAKE IT”. And guess what? My blog post made a brief cameo in the trailer, right after Casey Newton, something I found amusing. Anyway, the series was supposed to make fun of all the people who criticise what TBC is doing with their Arc browser and highlight all the reasons why they’re not going to make it. I guess that’s because they’re so confident in their product and are probably sure that they will, in fact, make it, whatever that means.</p>
<p>Well, it’s June. The teaser video came out on March 21st, the second episode on March 22nd, and the third on April 4th. I’m still waiting for a new one to come out but I guess they might not make it to the end of their planned 5 videos series. Oh well.</p>
<p>Unrelated but can I just say that I find the name of the company itself quite baffling? It’s called The Browser Company but what they make is a wrapper around the Chromium web browser. So the browser company is making everything but the actual browser. Can you imagine starting a company called “the pizza company” and then outsourcing the pizza part to a 3rd party? So bizarre.</p>
<p>Anyway, TBC people, if you’re reading this, I look forward to your next video about how you “ruined the internet” and also very much look forward to the one about how you “listen to your members” considering you never replied to the two emails I sent to your support.</p>                <hr>

One of the flaws in the design of Teslas is they are really difficult to operate safely for people who are farsighted, such as myself. A lot of the <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/03/teslascreen.png">status messages</a> are too small for me to read without reading glasses, and in the time it takes to put them on the message is gone. Esp frustrating for the messages that tell you to do this or that to keep using FSD. And when I'm flipping the glasses down, my eyes are not on the road Mr or Ms Tesla. This is a design problem. Maybe you should use voice prompts for this kind of stuff. Or use a camera to see if my hands are on the wheel.

View ChatGPT on that timeline and you'll see its significance. You didn't write it, I didn't. Each of us may have contributed a little, and <i>isn't that what we want?</i> To help build the base of human knowledge? It gives our lives meaning.

## AMD unveils Ryzen 9000 CPUs for desktop, Zen 5 takes center stage at Computex 2024

date: 2024-06-03, from: OS News

In regards to performance, AMD is touting an average (geomean) IPC increase in desktop workloads for Zen 5 of 16%. And with the new desktop Ryzen chips&#8217; turbo clockspeeds remaining largely identical to their Ryzen 7000 predecessors, this should translate into similar performance expectations for the new chips. The AMD Ryzen 9000 series will also launch on the AM5 socket, which debuted with AMD&#8217;s Ryzen 7000 series and marks AMD&#8217;s commitment to socket/platform longevity. Along with the Ryzen 9000 series will come a pair of new high-performance chipsets: the X870E (Extreme) and the regular X870 chipsets. The fundamental features that vendors will integrate into their specific motherboards remain tight-lipped. Still, we do know that USB 4.0 ports are standard on the X870E/X870 boards, along with PCIe 5.0 for both PCIe graphics and NVMe storage, with higher AMD EXPO memory profile support expected than previous generations. ↫ Gavin Bonshor at AnandTech I absolutely love that AMD maintains compatibility with its chipset and socket generations as well as it does. I&#8217;m currently running a Ryzen 9 7900X, and I see no reason to upgrade any time soon, but it&#8217;s good to know I&#8217;ll at least have otions once the time comes. Compare this to Intel, which broke compatibility pretty much intentionally almost every generation for years now, and this is a huge win for consumers. Of course, as AMD regains more and more of its foothold across the market, it will eventually also resort to the kind of tactics Intel has been using while it pretty much had the market to itself. It&#8217;s only a matter of time before we&#8217;ll see the first new Ryzen generation that mysteriously requires a new socket or chipset out of the blue.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-06-03, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

We should apply mathematics to language design. The goal of the language should be maximum simplicity for the human developer. As much of the complexity as possible should be handled by software, either at compile-time or runtime. It should strive to read like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode">pseudocode</a>. We started out writing code by toggling switches on the front panel of the computer, and for a few decades we were factoring and making it simpler with every iteration, but then we turned around in the other direction. I am from the church of factoring. I do it in my designs of products at all levels, and I treat languages with the same care. It turns out all the rules of working on open systems also apply to language design. I plan to write more about this.

## Tock: a secure embedded operating system for microcontrollers

date: 2024-06-03, from: OS News

Tock is an embedded operating system designed for running multiple concurrent, mutually distrustful applications on Cortex-M and RISC-V based embedded platforms. Tock&#8217;s design centers around protection, both from potentially malicious applications and from device drivers. Tock uses two mechanisms to protect different components of the operating system. First, the kernel and device drivers are written in Rust, a systems programming language that provides compile-time memory safety and type safety. Tock uses Rust to protect the kernel (e.g. the scheduler and hardware abstraction layer) from platform specific device drivers as well as isolate device drivers from each other. Second, Tock uses memory protection units to isolate applications from each other and the kernel. ↫ Tock GitHub page We&#8217;ve never featured Tock on OSNews before, as far as I can tell, which seems odd considering it&#8217;s been around for a while. The most recent release stems from January 2023, so a short while ago, but that&#8217;s not too surprising considering the target audience of this embedded operating system. It&#8217;s licensed under either Apache or MIT.

<p>We spent this month moving northward through both southern and northern British Columbia. We've been moving almost every day, stopping every night to anchor, sleep and recuperate. Sailing near land is not as relaxing as sailing offshore, this reef-strewn coast requires careful navigation. We've had many long days of endless tacking from one side of the channel to the other, almost all the way to Port McNeill, then after that we started to get more weather from the south for some mostly pleasant, but cold and rainy, downwind sailing. We've been using our woodstove a lot, in evenings it helps warm the boat after a long sail.</p>

<p>On May 29th, 623 nautical miles miles after leaving Victoria, we arrived in Prince Rupert, our last major port in British Columbia before we head north to Southeast Alaska. Then, on June 2nd, we arrived in Ketchikan, Southeast Alaska. Most of our updates this month detail some of the places we've been(see the above list). To see our path, look at <a href="https://100r.co/site/western_canada.htm">Western Canada</a> and <a href="https://100r.co/site/us_se_alaska.html">us se alaska</a>. We update the map as we find internet.</p>

<p>We've seen sea otters, lots of humpback whales, two pods of orcas(one pod had a baby tagging along), eagles, and lots of mountains. In other non-travel related news, Devine is going to speak again at <a href="https://handmadecities.com/seattle/" target="_blank">Handmade Seattle</a> this upcoming November!</p>

If I wanted my calculator to give me incorrect results I could press the wrong keys. In other words, ChatGPT is a very new tool. It can be hard to control, you have to check what it says, and try different questions. But the result, if you pay attention and don't drive it under the wheels of a bus, is that you can do things you never could do before.

## Saying a lot while saying nothing at all about Ansible AWX

date: 2024-06-02, from: Jeff Geerling blog

<span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Saying a lot while saying nothing at all about Ansible AWX</span>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>A few days ago, the post <a href="https://www.ansible.com/blog/upcoming-changes-to-the-awx-project/">Upcoming Changes to the AWX Project</a> came across my feed. An innocuous title, but sometimes community-impacting changes are buried in posts like this. So, as an interested Ansible user, I read through the post.</p>

<p>In 1,610 words, almost nothing of substance was written.</p>

<p>A lot about how it's not 2014 anymore, so 2014-era architecture doesn't suit AWX. Then a big bold disclaimer at the bottom:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Before we conclude, we should be clear about what will not happen.</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>We are not changing the Ansible project</li>
  <li>We are not adjusting our OSS license structure</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Ultimately, we need to make some changes to the way our systems work and our projects are structured. Not a rewrite but a refactoring and restructuring of how some of the core components connect and communicate with each other.</p></blockquote></div>

<a href="https://www.threads.net/@mossbergwalt/post/C7rli4JJ3St">Walt Mossberg shows</a> why ChatGPT is such a conversation-starter, and thus is incredible art. He asked it to draw a picture of himself with Kara Swisher. Of course everyone did that, and posted the result to the thread. The variety of responses is amazing, revealing of what I'm not sure. Here's <a href="https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/C7uYdAcJpTQ">the one</a> it came up with for me.

## Burning book festivals is not a climate solution

I bet you could do a beautifully readable blog by just dynamically rendering its RSS feed.  Why bother statically rendering the home page, month page, day page or pages for each individual post. Dynamic servers are so cheap these days.

Ken Smith pointed out the story in the <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/05/31/123255.html#a125308">very last postscript</a>. Before that, I hadn't put it together that podcasting worked because for a while Adam did my job, and for a while I did his. That guaranteed two things -- that the technology would be maximally simple, and that anyone with a computer could do the whole recording and production job without help from an expensive studio. In both cases the result was nowhere near commercial standards, but that didn't matter, in fact it helped that there were so many glitches in my early podcasts, that said that hey if this guy can do it, so can I.

## This message does not exist

date: 2024-06-02, from: OS News

The act of discarding a message that does not exist must therefore do one of two things. It may cause the message contents to also cease to exist. Alternately, it might not affect the existence but only the accessibility of message contents. Perhaps they continue to exist, but discarding the message (which already did not exist) causes the copy operation to cease being invokable on the message contents (even though they do continue to exist). The story of existence has many mysteries. ↫ Mark J. Nelson The one question that can really break my brain in a way that is feels like it&#8217;s physically hurting &#8211; which it can&#8217;t, because, fun fact, there&#8217;s no pain receptors in the brain &#8211; is the question what exists outside of the universe? Any answer you can come up with just leads to more questions which just lead to more questions, in an infinite loop of possible answers and questions that the human mind is not equipped to grasp. Anyway, it turns out using Outook can lead to the same existential crises.
