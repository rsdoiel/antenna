## Webb Spots a Starburst

date: 2024-05-30, from: NASA breaking news

The James Webb Space Telescope observed “starburst” galaxy NGC 4449, seen in this image released on May 29, 2024. Starbursts are intense periods of star formation usually concentrated at a galaxy’s core, but NGC 4449’s activity is much more widespread — likely due to past interactions with its galactic neighbors. Astronomers can study this galaxy [&#8230;]

## Biden: Why isn't Trump in jail?

date: 2024-05-30, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Biden would be a fine president if our problems were limited to the virus, the economy and climate change. </p>
<p>He's like Obama, but with much more experience at getting things done in Washington. </p>
<p>His failure is that the fascist movement in the country is much stronger now than it was when he took office. </p>
<p>Are we better off than we were four years ago? No, sadly we are worse off. Trump is a much bigger threat now.</p>
<p>Biden is a fine LBJ-like president. And like LBJ, he has his Vietnam. Biden's war he can't end is called Trump. Trump isn't in jail. That's the failure right there. </p>
<p>The problem could be fixed if we had this discussion out in the open, so that the press raises it every day and in every press event. They shouldn't be trying to embarrass him about his age, that's rude and deceptive, instead they should ask why isn't Trump in jail?</p>
<p>If Biden wanted to address this, and it would certainly help his chances of winning, he would:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fire Garland immediately.</li>
<li>Apologize for not firing him sooner. It was a mistake. My mistake. I own it. I am sorry.</li>
<li>Nominate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Raskin">Jamie Raskin</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liz_Cheney">Liz Cheney</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruben_Gallego">Ruben Gallego</a> as the new AG.   </li>
<li>Biden's number one promise is that he will <i>fully</i> prosecute Trump and all insurrectionists in his second term, starting now. This would also serve as a warning to any Trump supporters that tried to pull any tricks before or during the election. </li>
</ul>
<p>Trump is making a fool of Biden by saying openly that he will be a dictator on Day 1.</p>
<p>People who think Trump is losing don't get it. People are rightly fed up with Biden. But not for the economy. That's bullshit. And not because he's old. Rather because he's selling us out, just hoping against hope that the voters will save us. It's kind of unreasonable to expect that when you, the person we elected president to get us out of this hole, didn't fire the biggest obstacle to our starting to dig. </p>
<p>Depend on Mueller, Congress, the press, the courts, now the voters. </p>
<p>No Biden, you're the president. This is <i>your</i> job. </p>

## 2024-05-23 Death and dying

date: 2024-05-30, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-05-23-death-and-dying">2024-05-23 Death and dying</h1>

<p>This is the first time somebody is dying in my close family where I am old enough to be an adult about it.</p>

<p>One of my sisters died when I was about twenty. I was living in Switzerland with my dad, and it was terrible to hear my mom crying at the phone, practically unable to tell me what had happened, to then see my father confused, shocked. I booked a flight for him but didn&rsquo;t go myself. My mom was living in Portugal with my two sisters. I wasn&rsquo;t there for my sister&rsquo;s burial. People had to be buried within 48 hours, back then. I don&rsquo;t know how things are now. There was school and stuff and I had not lived with my sisters for a few years. I didn&rsquo;t feel very close. It just felt weird. I didn&rsquo;t know what it was supposed to mean.</p>

<p>Now, thirty years later, my stepfather is dying. His kidneys are failing, his liver is failing, his lungs are filling up with water, his heart is failing; they can&rsquo;t give him his heart medication because the kidneys are at their limits, can&rsquo;t have him move around because he&rsquo;s weak, and so he&rsquo;s breaking down. I mean, he&rsquo;s calm, he knows what&rsquo;s happening, and he&rsquo;s very, very tired. He&rsquo;s ready to go.</p>

<p>I think that in my heart, I know that this is how it works. We have to go one day. I don&rsquo;t want to spend the last hours hooked up to machines. I&rsquo;ll be very, very tired. I&rsquo;ll just want to go home. I also won&rsquo;t want anybody around me to be sad. Hopefully, I&rsquo;ll feel that I lived a good life, that I had a good time, that the people I spend my time with were decent people, worthy of the short time I was given. I hope that I will be able to let go and be at peace. It&rsquo;s what I hear about my stepfather.</p>

<p>But when I sit in that family video call, with siblings in Portugal and Germany and my, and my mother, and one after another people start crying, choking up, it&rsquo;s hard. It&rsquo;s a that invisible choker, grabbing us, one after another.</p>

<p>I need to remember the good times, the conversations we had, the laughter we shared. I need to book a flight and see the rest of our family. All that independence and all that living abroad is coming back to haunt us, now.</p>

<p>To go and support each other.</p>

<p>Go and hug your loved ones.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Family">#Family</a></p>

<p><strong>2024-05-27</strong>. I arrived today. He didn’t look good at all. In fact, he seemed to be barely holding on to life. Sleeping, mostly. Occasionally, gasping for air, staring, maybe recognizing us, saying a word or two. It was heartbreaking. He died the same day. The doctor and the nurse came, two very friendly people. Removed the tubes, stopped the Morphium machine, made his death official.</p>

<p>There were so many tears. A step brother, a half-brother, a half-sister, my sister, my half-brother’s wife, their kid, my mom… the kid was the only one that seemed unperturbed. “Don’t be sad, grandma!”</p>

<p>Later the funerary services came to pick up the body. Again, both of them super nice. We’ll see how things go, tomorrow. My mother is not feeling well. I seem to be doing OK. I can be strong when it’s not my partner that has died.</p>

<p>I’m happy we were all there for him, singing songs, bringing him his birthday cake (he died on his 78th birthday). I’m happy we were all there for each other.</p>

<p><strong>2024-05-28</strong>. Cremation today. The sun is out. People on the radio.</p>

<p><strong>2024-05-30</strong>. On the way home. It was good to see the family again. I gave a little speech in Portuguese, explaining how the language continues to remain important to us, even if we live a abroad, and how hard it was for a family where people live in different countries, alone – but also how our parents divorcing and marrying had led to an ever growing family. There are more parents, more siblings, and I love it and it helps. We can all help each other. And my deceased stepfather was certainly an enrichment for our family, bringing anarchy and lawlessness and laughter into a family that was rigid and regimented and dour, and how we all grew with that and how it was important to remember the good times we had and the lessens we all drew from his presence. Truly, a great influence for all of us.</p>

<p>I still remember how I met him years before my mother met him. He lived across the river alone with his son, wild and free and I was so jealous. I wished to love like that! And then my parents divorced, my dad went back to Switzerland and a year later I followed him and got to live wild and free like them, it was amazing. And one day I came back and there were rumors that our mother had found a boyfriend. Imagine my surprise when it was him! The wild and free guitar playing dude from across the river! And eventually my friend from school turned into my stepbrother, moved in with my mom, lived in my room. It was mysterious and magical and then to see him and his father struggle with my mom, the changes they brought about, it was a miracle.</p>

<p>So, my man, wherever you are, here‘s to you and your last trip, to your guitars and flutes, your love of music and freedom, your spirit of independence and love of people and aliens. Cheers! I hope to see you again.</p>

The best humor is about other people being stupid, evil, clumsy or their misfortune. Watch a SNL skit. It's not about people being smart or brave, kind, generous or otherwise wonderful. That's another kind of entertainment. We find the misfortune of others funny. Especially famous, successful people.

## Help identify these obscure operating systems and vendors

date: 2024-05-30, from: OS News

Over on the GNU config-patches mailing list, Zack Weinberg is looking for help identifying a number of ancient operating systems and vendors. These are probably all either vendor or OS names from the late 1980s or early 1990s. Can anyone help me fill out the following list of things that ought to appear in testsuite/config-sub.data, if I knew what to put in place of the question marks? ???-pc533 ???-pc533-??????-sim ???-sim-??????-ultra ???-ultra-??????-unicom ???-unicom-??????-acis ???-???-aos???-triton ???-???-sysv3???-oss ???-???-sysv3???-storm-chaos ???-???-??? ↫ Zack Weinberg One of them has already been identified &#8211; &#8220;storm-chaos&#8221; turns out to have been added to binutils and/or maybe GCC in 2000, and after some digging around, John Marshall found what it&#8217;s referring to: chaos, a hobby operating system for x86 written in C. It has a long history, and after a period of inactivity came back in 2015 with a new website. Some new releases followed, with the last one being version 0.3.0 in 2019. It&#8217;s been silence since then. The others are still up for grabs to be discovered. There is some talk that the pc533 one might be a misspelling of pc532, which would refer to the &#8220;NS32K-based PC532 board running NetBSD&#8221;. This is an incredibly obscure complete system built around the NS32532, of which only around 150 were built in the early &#8217;90s. However, Weinberg is hesitant to accept this theory without more information, since there is already code to handle the pc532, and he wants to be sure before making any changes. If there is one place on the internet outside of the GNU mailing lists that might be able to help Weinberg, it&#8217;s the OSNews audience. We have so many older people reading OSNews who have been working or otherwise active in this field for many decades, and I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if these cryptic names make some bells ring for some of you. If one of you does e-mail a reply, be sure to mention this article &#8211; organic marketing to help keep us going!

Carol Reed’s Odd Man Out is a brilliant movie about … well, that’s the question.

## AI and the English language

                <p>I was going through my morning routine of checking emails and various forums and chats, when I stumbled on <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@eleventy/112526068812208213">this post on mastodon</a>.</p>
<p>Not going to comment on the stupidity of the suggestion itself but it got me wondering if the fact that most of the web is English-based is going to be both a blessing and a curse for these AI. There is just so much nonsense written in English online, maybe a lot more as a % compared to the other languages.</p>
<p>I very much look forward to reading some studies done by someone smarter than me in the future. It's a fascinating topic.</p>                <hr>

How does spaceflight affect tumor-bearing fruit fly hosts and their parasites?

Despite decades of studies on fruit flies and wasps, little was known about how their immune systems interact with natural parasites in space.&#160;Drosophila&#160;parasitoid&#160;wasps modify blood cell [&#8230;]

## Google is killing off the messaging service inside Google Maps

date: 2024-05-29, from: OS News

Google is killing off a messaging service! This one is the odd &#8220;Google Business Messaging&#8221; service—basically an instant messaging client that is built into Google Maps. If you looked up a participating business in Google Maps or Google Search on a phone, the main row of buttons in the place card would read something like &#8220;Call,&#8221; &#8220;Chat,&#8221; &#8220;Directions,&#8221; and &#8220;Website.&#8221; That &#8220;Chat&#8221; button is the service we&#8217;re talking about. It would launch a full messaging interface inside the Google Maps app, and businesses were expected to use it for customer service purposes. Google&#8217;s deeply dysfunctional messaging strategy might lead people to joke about a theoretical &#8220;Google Maps Messaging&#8221; service, but it already exists and has existed for years, and now it&#8217;s being shut down. ↫ Ron Amadeo at Ars Technica When it comes to Google, it&#8217;s often hard to distinguish meme from reality.

## Vox Media and The Atlantic sign content deals with OpenAI

date: 2024-05-29, from: OS News

Speaking of The Verge, its parent company Vox Media, along with The Atlantic, have signed a deal with OpenAI. Two more media companies have signed licensing agreements with OpenAI, allowing their content to be used to train its AI models and be shared inside of ChatGPT. The Atlantic and Vox Media — The Verge’s parent company — both announced deals with OpenAI on Wednesday. ↫ Emilia David at The Verge In the case of Vox Media, the deal was made and announced without informing their staff, which obviously doesn&#8217;t sit well with especially Vox&#8217; writers. By making deals like this, upper management gets to double-dip on the fruits of their workers&#8217; labour &#8211; first, the published content generates ad revenues, and second, OpenAI pays them to use said content for training and other purposes. And once the &#8220;AI&#8221; gets good enough, more and more of the writers will be fired, leaving only a skeleton crew of lower-paid workers to clean up the &#8220;AI&#8221; output. With this deal, the writing is on the wall for every journalist at Vox Media &#8211; you&#8217;re currently contributing to your own obsolescence, and your bosses are getting paid for it. As far as I know, OSNews&#8217; owner, David, has not yet been contacted by OpenAI. Regardless, I&#8217;ll sell the past 20-odd years of my terrible takes for 69 million euros, after deducting Swedish taxes. And since OpenAI is run by billionaires: taxes are this thing where normal people pay a portion of their income to the government in return for various government services. It&#8217;s wild, I know.

## Technical writing is not a dead-end job, it's a landing pad

date: 2024-05-29, from: Blog by Fabrizio Ferri-Benedetti

With the job market getting tougher by the day, there&rsquo;s a rising belief among tech writers that their role is &ldquo;too niche&rdquo; and a &ldquo;dead-end job&rdquo;. I think that&rsquo;s the wrong way of looking at our profession — at any profession. Let me cast aside that dark veil of pessimism and offer an alternative viewpoint, that of tech writing as a platform to other professions, one that lets you move laterally with just a bit of curiosity and courage.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-05-29, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

How can we tell if ChatGPT is intelligent? How can I tell if you're intelligent. How do I know I'm intelligent. It could be my "intelligence" is as algorithmic as ChatGPT's. It could be that my intelligence is only a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-preservation">survival mechanism</a>, and the only way I could think of something I think is intelligent is if it furthers my chance to reproduce. But what happens when our intellect instructs us to destroy the environment we depend on for life? It could be we are already obsolete, without the robots, it sure feels that way, and that our only <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah%27s_Ark">ark</a> that could lead us to a new place where our species can survive in some form is for us to morph into electronic beings whose intelligence is distributed around the planet so we don't die if it becomes uninhabitable in one place, but not in others. And a LLM might thrive in an environment that can't support human life.

## Microsoft’s ‘Auto Super Resolution’ DLSS competitor isn’t exclusive to Qualcomm

date: 2024-05-29, from: OS News

When you launch a game on a Snapdragon on a Windows laptop, you might get an AI frame rate boost from Microsoft’s mysterious Auto Super Resolution (Auto SR) feature. But while Microsoft hasn’t fully explained how the feature works, The Verge can now confirm it’s not Qualcomm technology, not exclusive to Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon X chips, and not exclusive to specific games, either. ↫ Sean Hollister at The Verge These resolution enhancer technologies from NVIDIA, AMD, and apparently Microsoft are another great use of what we today call &#8220;AI&#8221; technologies. Of course, I wish we didn&#8217;t have to deal with several proprietary offerings but instead enjoyed several open source versions and possibly a standard to work off of, but give it some time, and we may still get there. Like I&#8217;ve said before &#8211; there&#8217;s nothing inherently wrong with &#8220;AI&#8221; technologies, as long as they&#8217;re used in ways that make sense, run locally, and most importantly, aren&#8217;t based on the wholesale theft of artists&#8217; and programmers&#8217; works. Unsurprisingly, the tech bros at companies like OpenAI don&#8217;t really understand the concept of &#8220;consent&#8221;, and until they do, their offerings should be deemed illegal.

<p>Yes we’re still talking about shooting video on iPhones. But I also want to talk about digital cinema shooting in general, in a world where top camera makers are battling to give filmmakers everything we want in a small, affordable package.</p><p>How does the DV Rebel spirit — born of camcorders and skateboard dollies — live on in a time of purpose-built digital cinema cameras that fit in your hand? For me, it’s meant keeping my rigs small and manageable. I love gimbals and drones and lidar focus rigs, but I’m happiest when my whole rig — tripod and all — can be picked up and moved with one hand.</p><p>We suffered through so many years of too little camera, but now it’s quite easy to have way too much camera. I want to live in that sweet spot where image quality is not compromised, but I can still move fast.</p><p>Turns out the same is true of camera apps.</p>

<h2>The Goldilocks of iPhone ProRes Log</h2>
<p>The built-in iPhone camera app is too little camera for shooting ProRes Log. There’s no preview LUTs, no manual adjustments, and the viewfinder is obscured by the controls.</p>
<p>The Blackmagic Camera app is a truly wonderful gift to the Apple Log shooter, addressing all these issues. The only feature it lacks is the ability to pick it up in a rush and quickly make great-looking video. So, confession time: I almost never use it for anything other than the most controlled studio shooting. My <a href="https://prolost.com/blog/iphonelog-peru-taiwan">Peru and Taiwan travel clips</a>? Almost entirely shot with the native camera app.</p>
<p>There’s a massive gulf between the too-little Apple app and the too-much Blackmagic offering. And my friends at Lux, makers of the wonderful <a href="https://halide.cam">Halide</a> still photo app for iPhone, have created a new video app that lives squarely in this sweet spot.</p>

It’s the perfect DV Rebel video app.</p><h2>Prolost Brand LUTs</h2><p>Kino features LUTs created by filmmakers you’ll recognize, but the honor of supplying the most boring LUT fell to me. The Neutral LUT is none other than my Prolost “TECH” LUT that I explained <a href="https://prolost.com/blog/iphonelog-peru-taiwan">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Point and Shoot Experience, Pro Results</h2>
<p>Accessibility is core to the DV Rebel ethos, and along with that came a focus on tuning not-quite-professional gear to achieve cinematic results. Years ago, this was essential for the indie filmmaker, as professional gear was truly unattainable.</p>
<p>But even when professional tools are abundant and affordable (seriously, what a time to be a filmmaker!), sometimes the right camera for the job is the one that <em>feels great to shoot with.</em> And the same is true for camera apps.</p>

In case you haven&#8217;t heard, there&#8216;s a brawl happening over at X, Musk vs LeCun. For days I tried to resist commenting, but so many people (friends, reporters, etc) keep asking me for my opinion I have decided to oblige. The first thing that I will tell you is that each of those not so-gentle men scored some points; neither kept things above the belt.

## Bearblog is fun

date: 2024-05-29, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>If you’re into blogging and the blogging world, chances are you might have heard about <a href="https://bearblog.dev">bearblog.dev</a>. And if you’re a reader of this blog you might have also <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/pb-herman-martinus">read the interview with Herman</a>, Bearblog’s creator.</p>
<p>I never used Bearblog, mainly because I’m happy with my setup and I have no reason to look for another blog solution.</p>
<p>That said, a few weeks back I started toying with the idea of porting the design of this site over to Bear, just for fun. And to my surprise, creating a bear version of my site was surprisingly simple.</p>
<p>Which is why <a download href="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/bearblog-is-fun/8994e049c2-1717000249/bearblog_manu_theme.zip">I&rsquo;m happy to release a V0.1 of this experiment</a>. The demo site I’m using it’s currently up at <a href="https://css.bearblog.dev">css.bearblog.dev</a>. This is a very quick and dirty version. There's some leftover code in there but it should mostly work.</p>
<hr />
<p>Quick note: I might use that test site in the future to code other themes so depending on when you’re reading this post, the live preview might not actually show the correct theme.</p>
<hr />
<p>To install it just head over to the “Themes” section in your dashboard, delete everything inside the “Edit theme CSS” section and paste in the code of my theme. Hit “Publish” and you’re done.</p>
<p>I’m sure there will be bugs because there are always bugs. If you need help with anything <a href="mailto:hello@manuelmoreale.com">send me an email</a>. The theme is free, if you want to contribute the best way to do it is to <a href="https://ko-fi.com/manuelmoreale">become a member of my “One a Month” club.</a></p>                <hr>

<a href="https://tulanehullabaloo.com/65986/uncategorized/imitation-game-can-ai-rival-student-intellect/">Walter Isaacson asks</a> if ChatGPT can rival a student's intellect. My answer as a former teaching assistant who graded lots of student programs, absolutely. It rivals the intellect of every human being I know, including professors. It hasn't learned yet how to synthesize new ideas, it seems. And there are strong guardrails that keep it from going into certain areas. It is more capable than we know, therefore. BTW, I didn't realize he teaches at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulane_University">Tulane</a>. I got my undergraduate degree there in 1976.

## Turbo9: a pipelined 6809 microprocessor IP

date: 2024-05-29, from: OS News

The Turbo9 is a pipelined microprocessor IP written in Verilog that executes a superset of the Motorola 6809 instruction set. It is a new modern microarchitecture with 16-bit internal datapaths that balances high performance vs small area / low power. The Turbo9R with a 16-bit memory interface achieves 0.69 DMIPS/MHz which is 3.8 times faster than Motorola&#8217;s original 8-bit MC6809 implementation. It is an active graduate research project at the Department of Electrical &#38; Computer Engineering at the University of Florida. ↫ Turbo9 GitHub page The Turbo9 is aimed at SoC sub-blocks and small mixed-signal ASIC, so it&#8217;s definitely not intended to be some sort of general purpose CPU. The reason for opting for the 6809 instead of, say, RISC-V or ARM, is that the 6809 enables a far smaller footprint due to being 16bit, which is all the target market really needs from the Turbo9. The current version of the Turbo9 is thoroughly verified and is capable of running C code. However, we still consider this version v0.9 because we are missing a few items. All the 6809 instructions and addressing modes have been implemented and tested except SYNC and CWAI. The signed versions of the Turbo9&#8217;s 16-bit divide and multiply need to be completed. Interrupts are partially implemented including SWI and Reset. ↫ Turbo9 GitHub page This is the kind of riveting content you&#8217;ll only really find on OSNews.

## Jef Raskin’s Canon Cat

date: 2024-05-28, from: OS News

Few things in technology excites me more than an amazing computer I have never heard of before &#8211; especially one with pedigree. Many people take a casual glance at this machine and say, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t that an overgrown word processor?&#8221; And one could certainly think so, in part because of its keyboard-centric operation, but mostly from the utterly uncomprehending way Canon advertised it in 1987. Canon dubbed the Cat a &#8220;work processor&#8221; because of its built-in telecommunications, modem and word processor even though Jef Raskin, its designer, had intended it as a &#8220;people&#8217;s computer&#8221; that could be inexpensive, accessible and fully functional — all things he had hoped to accomplish at Apple after first launching the Macintosh project, prior to departing in 1982. Canon, however, never fully grasped the concept either. Apart from the tone-deaf marketing, Canon sold the device through their typewriter division and required the display to only show what a daisywheel printer could generate, limiting its potential as a general purpose workstation. ↫ Cameron Kaiser Wait, wait, wait. You mean to tell me there&#8217;s a unique, well-designed computer that seemed ahead of its time, sold by a printer and copier company, that failed in the market due to botched marketing and grotesque misunderstanding among management of what the device is supposed to be? What are the odds this happens twice? The Canon Cat was designed and built by Jeff Raskin&#8217;s &#8211; of Macintosh fame &#8211; company Information Appliance, Inc., and licensed to Canon. It&#8217;s an all-in-one 68000-based computer with a bitmap display, an operating system stored in ROM, and a comprehensive Forth environment easily accessible despite the device autostarting to a word processor (because Canon). Much like some of the predecessor machines Raskin had worked on before licensing the Cat to Canon, the Cat has an intriguing input method that I&#8217;d never seen before. Instead of a mouse or even cursor keys, it has two keys labeled &#8220;Leap&#8221; that are used for manipulating the text cursor. In fact, there aren&#8217;t even conventional cursor keys. The Cat has the same &#8220;leap&#8221; keys as the Swyft and SwyftCard, in a bright but tasteful pink, and they work the same way to jump to portions of the document or into other documents. You can also use them to scroll with the SHIFT key, or move by single letters, sentences or paragraphs. The LEAP keys are also how you highlight text blocks to manipulate by LEAPing to the beginning, LEAPing to the end, and then pressing them together. ↫ Cameron Kaiser The Forth programming environment is also very interesting. It was hidden in that Canon didn&#8217;t really want you to use it, but Raskin&#8217;s company made no secret of it, and it was easily accessible. It uses a special dialect of Forth, which can be used at either a traditional OK prompt, or just by typing Forth code into the word processor, highlighting it, and executing it with a keyboard shortcut, after which any output will be displayed in the word processor as well. The Canon Cat was a market failure, and hence it shouldn&#8217;t be a surprise it&#8217;s exceedingly rare. The article further details the internals, some fixes that were required and performed, and much, much more. A follow-up article will delve deeper into the software, too.

## Microsoft published minimum system requirements, CPU support for Windows 11 LTSC 2024

date: 2024-05-28, from: OS News

Aside from that, the company also announced Windows 11 IoT Enterprise LTSC 2024 this week. The company has also published the minimum system requirements as well as supported processor families. They have been categorized as Preferred and Optional. Interestingly, SSD has been added as a minimum system requirement, which has been a rumour about the client OS since mid-2022. ↫ Sayan Sen at NeoWin The LTSC release, which is not really supposed to be used by average consumers, is still remarkably popular. It contains a fixed feature set and gets far fewer updates than regular Windows releases, it omits otherwise stock applications like Edge, and gives its users far more control over which updates are and are not installed. LTSC also enjoys 10 years of support from Microsoft. Interestingly enough, the minimum specifications for the IoT version of LTSC do not require a TPM 2.0, unlike the regular version of Windows, which infamously does require one. I would assume that the &#8220;preferred&#8221; minimum requirements, which does require TPM 2.0, line up very well with the minimum requirements for the regular LTSC version of Windows 11. Both will become available later this year, alongside the regular release of Windows 11 24H2.

## Consumption-to-creation ratio

date: 2024-05-28, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>You're currently reading this post either in your RSS feed, in your inbox, or in your browser. You are consuming content. Consuming content is what the majority of the people do most of the time online.  But what's the ideal ratio between consuming and creating content? I'd argue that a 100/0 split in favour of consumption is not ideal the same way a 0/100 also isn't. You need to consume at least some content in order to help your ideas evolve.</p>
<p>I posted 429 times on this site since January 1st, 2017. That's 429 posts in 2704 days or one every roughly 6 days. How many posts have I read in that same time span? Let's be conservative and assume I read 5 blog posts a day. That's more than 13500 blog posts and would put my consumption to creation ratio at around 97/3 which doesn't sound that much different than 100/0 but the actual, practical difference is huge. The difference is a blog with 429 posts in 7 and a half years.</p>
<p>Could that ratio be better? In theory yeah but how much better? Let's imagine I was posting once a day, every day. That would put my ratio at around 85/15. In order to go below that I'd either need to consume less content or I'd have to post more than once a day which, on a personal blog, it's completely unreasonable unless you treat your blog as a Twitter/Instagram replacement and that's not my case.</p>
<p>That 97/3 split, as I said, comes out of the very conservative assumption that I consume 5 posts a day. It doesn't take into consideration everything else I might consume: books, audio content, movies. If I were to factor in all that consumption I'd bet that my ratio is probably more close to 99/1 which sounds wrong but it really isn't when you stop to think about it.</p>
<p>I believe people should consume less content and produce more. Finding an output for creativity is important. But it's unreasonable to expect people to stop consuming content and replace that consumption with creation because the ratio will always be inevitably skewed towards consumption. And that's ok. If you're not a creative person, if you find hating yourself because you consume too much content and not create enough, embrace the fact that even a very tiny improvement, from 100/1 to 99.9/0.1 can mean a lot. It's the difference between letting your blog die and posting something a couple of times a year. Which is a substantial difference if you ask me!</p>
<p>Also, while I'm here talking about ratios, it's important to acknowledge the fact that not everyone can be creative in the same way. I often write that everyone should ditch social media and start blogging but the reality is that most people on social media are lurkers and for a lurker there's no point in having a blog. But, what you can do, is to engage with the people who do blog. Send them an email, let them know that you silently consume what they create, support what they do via tiny donations. It goes a long way.</p>                <hr>

## A common web component learning blunder

date: 2024-05-28, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>Through stalking the <a href="https://mastodon.social/tags/webcomponents">#WebComponents</a> hashtag and <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/courses/web-components/">my Frontend Masters course</a>, I’m privy to a lot of developers’ first experiences with web components. There’s a wide range of people digging in, but the most common first-time experience I come across is a developer coming from a classical component framework like React with JSX going straight to writing vanilla Web Components, becoming frustrated, and then deeming web components “not ready for primetime.”</p>
<p>Ignoring for a moment that web components <em>do</em> exist in the primetime and power some big and complex primetime web applications like Adobe’s Photoshop for Web, I half-understand this perspective. I understand the desire to not have a major dependency. I hate this bloated <code>node_modules</code> hellhole we’ve built over the last decade and while I’m not a <code>npm install</code> my problems away guy… I think this puritanical approach to dependencies is a misstep when diving into web components for the first time.</p>
<p>The analogy I’ve been using is that this is like jumping from a tall 130 kilobyte-story building (ReactDOM) right into the zero kilobyte sewers of web components. If you take anything from this post, please understand this: <em>web components (most likely) weren’t designed for you</em>. Not to dissuade you from using them, but they were <a href="https://blog.domenic.me/the-extensible-web/">purposefully designed</a> to be <a href="https://extensiblewebmanifesto.org/">a low-level bare metal primitive</a> for library authors to build on; they were designed to be used with a library, a thin layer of abstraction butter on top.</p>
<p>To understand this disparity further, let’s look at an example of what writing a component in a “modern” framework <em>feels</em> like…</p>

</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Now we have a component that’s almost identical to the familiar world of JSX but <em>without any Babel transforms or build steps</em>. For 7 kilobytes you get a lot more than some syntactic sugar, you get…</p>
<ul>
<li>A thin, tree-shakeable layer of abstraction for a modern developer experience</li>
<li>Reactive updates without VDOM</li>
<li>A more granular component lifecycle with a <code>render()</code> function</li>
<li>A cleaner way of registering and using reactive attributes and properties without overloading the <code>attributeChangedCallback</code></li>
<li>Template directives like <code>@click</code> for event handling and directives for JavaScript values (arrays, objects, etc).</li>
<li>And an <code>html</code> tagged template literal with an under-appreciated superpower ✨ that gives your components atomic updates under-the-hood.</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s value in learning how bare metal vanilla web components work in the same way there’s value in knowing how <code>Intl.RelativeTimeFormat()</code> works, but you probably want to use <a href="https://day.js.org/">Day.js</a> for your day-to-day work. You can totally <a href="https://hawkticehurst.com/writing/bring-your-own-base-class/">write your own base class abstraction</a> – and I want you to have the <code>JeffElement</code> base class of your dreams, I do – but you may find out (<a href="https://www.abeautifulsite.net/posts/building-custom-elements-with-a-library/">like Cory LaViska from Shoelace found out</a>) that after you write all your little helper functions and utilities that you’ll end up with something almost the exact same size and feature set as Lit, but not as well supported nor as battle-tested.</p>
<p>This makes me sound anti-vanilla web components and I’m not that by any means. Vanilla web components are a perfect fit for <a href="https://github.com/davatron5000/awesome-standalones">standalone components</a> and the Light DOM-forward flavor of “<a href="https://adactio.com/journal/20618">HTML web components</a>”, but I think the people having the most fun in this space are JavaScript minimalists who already prefer writing vanilla JavaScript. People like myself.</p>
<p>“If I have to use a library how is this any different than any other framework lock-in?” This is a valid question and one worthy of its own post, but I think you’ll find the lock-in costs of a web component library pretty minimal. Because all web components libraries extend a common base class, there’s a linear pathway out of vendor lock-in if necessary.</p>
<p>What I’m saying is this; next time you’re thinking about jumping from 130 kilobytes of developer convenience, maybe consider giving yourself a 7 kilobyte landing pad to cushion the fall.</p>

## What We Learned from a Year of Building with LLMs (Part I)

date: 2024-05-28, from: O'Reilly Radar

It’s an exciting time to build with large language models (LLMs). Over the past year, LLMs have become “good enough” for real-world applications. The pace of improvements in LLMs, coupled with a parade of demos on social media, will fuel an estimated $200B investment in AI by 2025. LLMs are also broadly accessible, allowing everyone, [&#8230;]

## Evolution of the ELF object file format

date: 2024-05-28, from: OS News

The ELF object file format is adopted by many UNIX-like operating systems. While I&#8217;ve previously delved into the control structures of ELF and its predecessors, tracing the historical evolution of ELF and its relationship with the System V ABI can be interesting in itself. ↫ MaskRay The article wasn&#8217;t lying. I had no reason to know this &#8211; and I&#8217;m pretty sure most of you didn&#8217;t either &#8211; but it turns out the standards that define ELF got caught up in the legal murkiness and nastiness of UNIX. After the dissolution of the committee governing ELF in 1995, stewardship went from one familiar name to the next, first Novell, then The Santa Cruz Operation, then Caldera which renamed itself to The SCO Group, and eventually ending up at UnXis (now Xinuos) in 2011. In 2015, the last maintainer of ELF left Xinuos, and since then, it&#8217;s been effectively unmaintained. Which is kind of wild, considering ELF is a crucial building block of virtually all UNIX and UNIX-like operating systems today. The article mentions there&#8217;s a neutral Google Group that discusses, among other things, ELF, but that, too, has seen dwindling activity. Still, that group has reached consensus on some changes; changes that are now not reflected in any of the official texts. It&#8217;s a bit of a mess. If you ever wanted to know the status of ELF as a standard, this article&#8217;s for you.

It's an incredible application, it will revolutionize how useful computers are to people, and the only people whose writing is ingested are employees of the companies. Not only will it increase utility, it will demonstrate in a very observable way how transformational the technology is. Probably will do nice things for the value of the stock too.

## MSI shows off motherboard with CAMM2 memory

date: 2024-05-27, from: OS News

Earlier this month, we talked about the arrival of the new CAMM2 memory module standard, specifically designed to make replaceable memory modules as fast and capable as soldered memory. There&#8217;s technically no reason for CAMM2 to not also be beneficial to desktop use, and it turns out MSI is experimenting with this. MSI on Thursday published the first image of a new desktop motherboard that supports the innovative DDR5 compression attached memory module (CAMM2). DDR5 CAMM2 modules are designed to improve upon the SO-DIMM form factor used for laptops, alleviating some of the high-speed signaling and capacity limitations of SO-DIMMs while also shaving down on the volume of space required. And while we&#8217;re eagerly awaiting to see CAMM2 show up in more laptops, its introduction in a PC motherboard comes as a bit of a surprise, since PCs aren&#8217;t nearly as space-constrained. ↫ Anton Shilov at AnandTech This MSI motherboard is a bit of an experiment, as it also contains other more experimental choices like back-mounted power connectors. While CAMM2&#8217;s space savings won&#8217;t mean much for most desktop builds, it does leave more room for CPU coolers, and it looks a bit cleaner, too.

## IceWM 3.5.0 released

date: 2024-05-27, from: OS News

IceWM, the venerable window manager we&#8217;ve all used at some point in our lives, has released a new version, 3.5.0. It&#8217;s a relatively minor release, so you&#8217;ve got things like a new install option which will install an extra theme, a fix for porting to NetBSD 10, translation updates, and more such small improvements. The AddressBar, a command line in the taskbar that can be summoned with ctrl+alt+space, also got some love, with file argument completion and support for the cd and pwd commands. You can compile IceWM yourself, of course, but it&#8217;ll most likely find its way into your distribution&#8217;s repository quickly enough.

## Feynman's Garden

date: 2024-05-26, from: Marginallia log

The best description of my problem solving process is the Feynman algorithm, which is sometimes presented as a joke where the hidden subtext is &ldquo;be smart&rdquo;, but I disagree. The &ldquo;algorithm&rdquo; is a surprisingly lucid description of how thinking works in the context of hard problems where the answer can&rsquo;t simply be looked up or trivially broken down, iterated upon in a bottom-up fashion, or approached with similar methods.
Feynman&rsquo;s thinking algorithm is described like this:
