## The bizarre secrets I found investigating corrupt Winamp skins

date: 2024-07-26, from: OS News

In January of 2021 I was exploring the corpus of Skins I collected for the Winamp Skin Museum and found some that seemed corrupted, so I decided to explore them. Winamp skins are actually just zip files with a different file extension, so I tried extracting their files to see what I could find. This ended up leading me down a series of wild rabbit holes. ↫ Jordan Eldredge I&#8217;m not going to spoil any of this.

## Full-featured email server running OpenBSD

date: 2024-07-26, from: OS News

This blog post is a guide explaining how to setup a full-featured email server on OpenBSD 7.5. It was commissioned by a customer of my consultancy who wanted it to be published on my blog. Setting up a modern email stack that does not appear as a spam platform to the world can be a daunting task, the guide will cover what you need for a secure, functional and low maintenance email system. ↫ Solène Rapenne If you ever wanted to set up and run your own email server, this is a great way to do it. Solène, an OpenBSD developer, will help you through setting up IMAP, POP, and Webmail, an SMTP server with server-to-server encryption and hidden personal information, every possible measure to make sure your server is regarded as legitimate, and all the usual firewall and anti-spam stuff you are definitely going to need. Taking back email from Google &#8211; or even Proton, which is now doing both machine learning and Bitcoin, of all things &#8211; is probably one of the most daunting tasks for anyone willing to cut ties with as much of big tech as possible. Not only is there the technical barrier, there&#8217;s also the fact that the major email providers, like Gmail or whatever Microsoft offers these days, are trying their darnest to make self-hosting email as cumbersome as possible by trying to label everything you send as spam or downright malicious. It&#8217;s definitely not an easy task, but at least with guides like this there&#8217;s some set of easy steps to follow to get there.

Several other galaxies, located relatively nearby to this one, are just beyond the frame of this image; one is close enough that gravitational interaction is driving [&#8230;]

## On the CrowdStrike Postmortem

Introduction Last time, I blogged on the massive IT outage created by CrowdStrike. Since then CrowdStrike has released their&#160; postmortem of&#160; what went wrong.&#160; Also hackers&#160; have been disassembling the CrowdStrike code to analyze how it works. Keep in mind that estimates&#160; of&#160; the&#160; damage to&#160; the&#160; economy&#160; of this outage are&#160; around&#160; 5.4 billion,&#160; [&#8230;]

## Bring back distro-wide themes!

date: 2024-07-26, from: Liam on Linux

Someone on Reddit was asking about the Bluecurve theme on Red Hat Linux.<br /><br />Back then, Red Hat Linux only offered KDE and GNOME, I think. The great thing about Bluecurve was that <em>they looked the same</em> and both of them <em>had the Red Hat look</em>.<p>Not any more. In recent years I've tried GNOME, Xfce, MATE, KDE, Cinnamon, and LXQt on Fedora.</p>  <p><strong>They all look different.</strong> They may have some  wallpaper in common but that's it. In any of them, there's no way you  can glance from across a room (meaning, too far away to read any text or  see any logos) and go &quot;oh, yeah, that's Fedora.&quot;</p>  <p>And on openSUSE, I tried all of them plus LXDE and IceWM. Same thing. Wallpaper at best.</p>  <p>Same on Ubuntu: I regularly try all the main flavours, <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/08/18/ubuntu_remixes/">as I did here</a> and they all look different. MATE makes an effort, Unity has some of the wallpapers, but that's about it.</p>  <p>If a vendor or project has one corporate brand and one corporate  look, usually, time and money and effort went into it. Into logos,  colours, tints, gradients, wallpaper, all that stuff.</p>  <p>It seems to me that the least the maintainers of different desktop flavours or spins could do is <em>adopt the official theme</em> and make their remixes look like they are the same OS from the same vendor.</p>  <p>I like Xfce. Its themes aren't great. Many, most, make window borders  so thin you can't grab them to resize. Budgie is OK and looks  colourful, but Ubuntu Budgie does <em>not</em> look like Ubuntu.</p>  <p>Kubuntu looks like Fedora KDE looks like Debian with KDE looks like  anything with KDE, and to my eyes, KDE's themes are horrible, as they  have been since KDE 1 -- yes I used 1.0, and liked it -- and <em>only</em> 3rd party distro vendor themes ever made KDE look good.</p>  <p>Only 2 of them, really: Red Hat Linux with Bluecurve, and Corel LinuxOS and Xandros.</p>  <p>Everyone else's KDE skins are horrible. All of them. It's one reason I  can't use KDE now. It almost hurts my eyes. (Same goes for TDE BTW.) It  is <em>nasty</em>.</p>  <p>Branding matters. Distros all ignore it now. They shouldn't.</p>  <p>And someone somewhere should bring back Bluecurve, or failing that,  port GNOME's Adwaita to all the other desktops. I can't stand GNOME but  its themes and appearance are the best distro in the West. (Some of the  Chinese ones like Deepin and Kylin are beautiful, but everyone's afraid  they're full of spyware for the Chinese Communist Party... and they  might be right.)</p><br /><br /><img src="https://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=liam_on_linux&ditemid=91365" width="30" height="12" alt="comment count unavailable" style="vertical-align: middle;"/> comments

## The NYT pulled another one

date: 2024-07-26, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/07/23/hopeKamala.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Somehow it's up to the Harris campaign to get the Trumps to have a normal American presidential campaign, not a prelude to a second attempted coup, which is what the Trumps are doing. I can see the op-ed they run in September saying that it's Harris's fault that the Trumps are fascist. </p>
<p>I <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/06.html#a135642">reinstated</a> my subscription because I need to actually read their words, not because they cover news, but because they <i>are</i> news. The news is that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Estate">fourth estate</a> in the US is gone. They have lost their minds. They aren't even trying. Their op-eds don't reflect facts, such as Trump will never be a serious candidate in the sense that the NYT thinks a candidate should be serious. The Democrats still will. But there's no need as far as I'm concerned, for a legitimate candidate to respond to their taunts. </p>
<p>They completely lost many of us in their extended campaign to force Biden to step aside. I knew they wouldn't stop there, because abusers never stop when you give in to them. They are the tragedy of America now, even more than Trump. We must replace them. The real question is who's going to step up to help restore  journalism to our country. </p>
<p>Thanks for listening.</p>
<p>PS: I am not pointing to their piece out of respect for people who have cancelled their subscriptions. </p>

## Google Recorder is what I wanted

date: 2024-07-26, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I lost my iPhone a few days ago. I think all the data is safe. First time I ever lost a phone. I ordered a new iPhone 15 Pro with 256GB, it will arrive on Monday hopefully. </p>
<p>In the meantime I've needed to use my Android phone to record voice memos. Google's product is called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.recorder&hl=en_US">Recorder</a>. It's just what I wanted. </p>
<p>It has a <a href="https://recorder.google.com/">website</a>, so you don't have to export your recording to get it where you need it to be, and it automatically does a transcript. There's an editor on the website, which again is exactly where I want it. </p>
<p>A 2-minute <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/2024/07/26/iTriedTheGoogleRecorderApp.m4a">voice memo/podcast</a> I recorded with the app.</p>
<p>BTW, I think the files are smaller?</p>
<p>Here's a <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/07/26/googleRecorderApp.png">screen shot</a>. </p>

## Unix-like things

date: 2024-07-26, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I sent a <a href="https://x.com/davewiner/status/1816831709351977372">tweet</a> to Eric Raymond today, lightly edited here, following up on a thread that started in <a href="http://scripting.com/2001/02/20.html">2001</a>. </p>
<p>What Raymond <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070517142407/http://www.xmlrpc.com/stories/storyReader$1265">said</a> in 2001.</p>
<ul>
<li>XML-RPC, in particular, is very much in the Unix spirit. It's deliberately minimalist but nevertheless quite powerful, offering a way for the vast majority of RPC applications that can get by on passing around boolean/integer/float/string datatypes to do their thing in a way that is lightweight and easy to to understand and monitor. This simple type ontology acts as a valuable check on interface complexity.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's very true, my design goal for my whole 50+ year career has been to factor my code so well so it was as clean as Unix is, from top to bottom</p>
<p>The virtue of relentless factoring is you can build higher if each layer of the stack lets through the functionality that's needed, and no more. Ideally there should be one way of doing something. and it should work pretty well. </p>
<p>I realized that the web, RSS and podcasting are also a Unix-like things. </p>
<p>Because they can be made to do anything, but are  simple, not a lot to understand.</p>
<p>But -- there's been this huge proliferation of languages and frameworks, and incredibly complex and underspecified formats. </p>
<p>Meanwhile core functions like storage combined with identity for end users, has not been implemented, because of course if the users had their own networked data independent of any platform vendor there would be no lockin. that's 2024 version of the cathedral, to follow your analogy.</p>
<p>Anyway, seeing you here made me think of this, I've wanted to say this to you for a long to you and now I have. ;-)</p>
<p>PS: The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070517142407/http://www.xmlrpc.com/stories/storyReader$1265">2001 email</a> from Eric Raymond.</p>

## Too Close To The Kernel

The CrowdStrike mess points out just how close some developers get to the kernel—and efforts to lock things down will help highlight the tension between security and user choice.

## P&B: Daniel Miller

date: 2024-07-26, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>This is the 48th edition of <em>People and Blogs</em>, the series where I ask interesting people to talk about themselves and their blogs. Today we have Daniel Miller and his blog, <a href="https://www.daniel.industries">daniel.industries</a></p>

<hr />
<h2>Let's start from the basics: can you introduce yourself?</h2>
<p>I am originally from Pennsylvania, went to school in Arizona, and ended up in Dallas, Texas by way of Florida, Washington DC, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. I studied Psychology and planned on pursuing graduate studies in organizational psychology, but ended up in software fairly quickly, within about a year of graduating. I was a developer for over a decade, and then a CTO for almost another decade. I'm currently looking for an opportunity where I can provide value to a business doing good in the world.</p>
<p>I used to make music but haven't done much of that for about 10 years. I ride my bicycle as often as possible, usually a few times a week. And I write on my blog!</p>
<h2>What's the story behind your blog?</h2>
<p>I've always been interested in the ideas around Personal Knowledge Management, so when I first saw Blogger and started blogging in 2001 I thought of it as a public notebook. It still serves that purpose. It was originally danielsjourney.com (still have the domain). I eventually changed to daniel.industries.</p>
<p>My peak readership was during the blogging boom of the 2000s, which coincided with my move to Bosnia, which people seemed to be interested in.</p>
<h2>What does your creative process look like when it comes to blogging?</h2>
<p>I use Notion for "capture" and have about 18 ideas in there. I have additional less-formed ideas tagged in my Logseq notes. I have 19 posts in a drafts folder with another 516 stashed in there from private writing websites I participated in years ago. In theory, I will someday get the good ones imported into the canonical notebook, but at this rate, it might never happen.</p>
<p>I try to write and publish in one sitting, otherwise the post might never get finished. I'm not afraid of editing a post after I've published it, though. It's my history, I can rewrite it if I want.</p>
<p>I also have <a href="https://daniel.industries/writing/">writing</a> (for stories and articles) and <a href="https://daniel.industries/music/">music</a> sections on the site. I plan on adding a "projects" page as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://daniel.industries/blog/">The blog</a> currently has 3417 posts. I posted much more early on (2001-2008), before Twitter and (some) maturity that came with age and experience...and I had a lot more time for it back then.</p>
<h2>Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe the physical space influences your creativity?</h2>
<p>It's less about my physical environment and more about my mental and emotional environment. The other reason I've blogged less in the last 14 years is that my life allows for less quiet time for thinking. I will have good ideas and make interesting connections while riding my bike, or in the shower, or right before falling asleep, but as my life has become more full with family and responsibilities, I find not many of those ideas make it onto a page anywhere (yet alone become coherent enough to go on the website).</p>
<h2>A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your tech stack?</h2>
<p>I use <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> with a Ruby Rakefile I brought with me from back when I used a gem called "Octopress" (which has been abandoned), which adds quality-of-life command line tools for managing posts, building, and publishing. I've also written a "backlink" plugin for Jekyll (see <a href="https://www.daniel.industries/2023/01/29/really-basic-backlinks-in-jekyll/">Really Basic Backlinks in Jekyll</a>).</p>
<p>While I have used Jekyll for over 10 years, before that I used Blogger, Moveable Type, WordPress, LiveJournal, and multiple versions of my own PHP CMS system (see <a href="https://daniel.industries/2017/12/26/swim-stock-take-part-2/">SWIM Stock-take Part 2</a>). But I've been a static site generator person for a long time. I think 11ty is probably better at this point, but so far I haven't felt the need to move off Jekyll.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://www.daniel.industries/2024/02/29/to-find-an-alternative-to-wordpress-just-go-back-to-the-beginning/">To Find an Alternative to Wordpress, Just Go Back to the Beginning</a>.</p>
<p>I've hosted on DreamHost since forever. I've had my domains with Hover for a long time.</p>
<h2>Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would you do anything differently?</h2>
<p>Static site generators seem to be all the rage these days, for good reason. Having everything as a flat file you can manage via source control and easily move around, search, mass update from your text editor of choice...it's better than having everything locked into a database in the cloud (or even on your computer), even if the product allows for easy exports. See <a href="https://www.daniel.industries/2018/08/14/web-artifact-permanence/">Web Artifact Permanence</a>.</p>
<h2>Financial question since the Web is obsessed with money: how much does it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost, or does it generate some revenue? And what's your position on people monetising personal blogs?</h2>
<p>The hosting is somewhere between $100-200 per year (I was kept at a lower price for a while, and I think that is over soon). I could host on GitHub or similar for free, but I have a handful of sites I host on DreamHost, so it is just easier to manage them all in one place.</p>
<p>I was bullish on tools that would allow individual artists to monetize their work without the need for middlemen, I even ran a nonprofit from 2003-2005 (see <a href="https://www.daniel.industries/2016/03/15/goodbye-integration-research/">Goodbye Integration Research Dot Org</a>) that was working on exactly that problem. I was excited when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9NjntTUJ1Q">Jack Conte first talked about Patreon at XOXO</a> (I was there in person--and it is still a good talk). Now we're there, and Patreon has to enshittify to appease investors, and Substack has to harbor fascists and pop modals in my face all the time, and I'm not so sure about the entire idea. I think it is better to just have something you can sell. It's hard. I think if you don't <em>have</em> to monetize your online work, that's better. There are too many pseudo-intellectual influencers out there, and too few Kottkes, <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/">Popovas</a>, or <a href="https://www.joanwestenberg.com/">Westenbergs</a>.</p>
<p>Those of us just hanging out in our digital living rooms on the cozy web are doing ok without having to perform for our audience.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://www.daniel.industries/2017/05/13/on-blogging/">On Blogging</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Keeping a personal blog in 2017 feels relatively futile. But while everyone else is <del>storing</del> throwing their stories, artifacts, thoughts, and meanings into the stream for others to consume on their phones while taking a dump or bored at lunch or while consuming some other media entirely, those of us who store our work on <em>actual domains</em> do it for ourselves--and our legacy. And while permalinks may--and do--rot faster than last week's bananas, the content is still <em>here</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...or <a href="https://www.daniel.industries/2016/09/05/rebels-episode-2/">Rebels: Episode 2</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Creating content on the internet and actually owning all of that content and retaining complete control over that content is still one of the most culturally radical things one can do. Sure, the marketers of the world will tell you you’re wasting your time, but that is only if your horizon for meaningful impact in the world has shortened to the amount of time a news story remains in your social network feed.</p>
</blockquote>

## Hubble Images a Classic Spiral

date: 2024-07-26, from: NASA breaking news

This NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope image treats viewers to a wonderfully detailed snapshot of the spiral galaxy NGC 3430 that lies 100 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Leo Minor. Several other galaxies, located relatively nearby to this one, are just beyond the frame of this image; one is close enough that gravitational interaction […]

## OpenAI beta tests SearchGPT search engine

date: 2024-07-25, from: OS News

Normally I&#8217;m not that interested in reporting on news coming from OpenAI, but today is a little different &#8211; the company launched SearchGPT, a search engine that&#8217;s supposed to rival Google, but at the same time, they&#8217;re also kind of not launching a search engine that&#8217;s supposed to rival Google. What? We’re testing SearchGPT, a prototype of new search features designed to combine the strength of our AI models with information from the web to give you fast and timely answers with clear and relevant sources. We’re launching to a small group of users and publishers to get feedback. While this prototype is temporary, we plan to integrate the best of these features directly into ChatGPT in the future. If you’re interested in trying the prototype, sign up for the waitlist. ↫ OpenAI website Basically, before adding a more traditional web-search like feature set to ChatGPT, the company is first breaking them out into a separate, temporary product that users can test, before parts of it will be integrated into OpenAI&#8217;s main ChatGPT product. It&#8217;s an interesting approach, and with just how stupidly popular and hyped ChatGPT is, I&#8217;m sure they won&#8217;t have any issues assembling a large enough pool of testers. OpenAI claims SearchGPT will be different from, say, Google or AltaVista, by employing a conversation-style interface with real-time results from the web. Sources for search results will be clearly marked &#8211; good &#8211; and additional sources will be presented in a sidebar. True to the ChatGPT-style user interface, you can keep &#8220;talking&#8221; after hitting a result to refine your search further. I may perhaps betray my still relatively modest age, but do people really want to &#8220;talk&#8221; to a machine to search the web? Any time I&#8217;ve ever used one of these chatbot-style user interfaces -including ChatGPT &#8211; I find them cumbersome and frustrating, like they&#8217;re just adding an obtuse layer between me and the computer, and that I&#8217;d rather just be instructing the computer directly. Why try and verbally massage a stupid autocomplete into finding a link to an article I remember from a few days ago, instead of just typing in a few quick keywords? I am more than willing to concede I&#8217;m just out of touch with what people really want, so maybe this really is the future of search. I hope I can just always disable nonsense like this and just throw keywords at the problem.

## Two threads, one core: how simultaneous multithreading works under the hood

date: 2024-07-25, from: OS News

Simultaneous multithreading (SMT) is a feature that lets a processor handle instructions from two different threads at the same time. But have you ever wondered how this actually works? How does the processor keep track of two threads and manage its resources between them? In this article, we’re going to break it all down. Understanding the nuts and bolts of SMT will help you decide if it’s a good fit for your production servers. Sometimes, SMT can turbocharge your system&#8217;s performance, but in other cases, it might actually slow things down. Knowing the details will help you make the best choice. ↫ Abhinav Upadhyay Some light reading for the (almost) weekend.

## Intel: Raptor Lake faults excessive voltage from microcode, fix coming in August

date: 2024-07-25, from: OS News

In what started last year as a handful of reports about instability with Intel&#8217;s Raptor Lake desktop chips has, over the last several months, grown into a much larger saga. Facing their biggest client chip instability impediment in decades, Intel has been under increasing pressure to figure out the root cause of the issue and fix it, as claims of damaged chips have stacked up and rumors have swirled amidst the silence from Intel. But, at long last, it looks like Intel&#8217;s latest saga is about to reach its end, as today the company has announced that they&#8217;ve found the cause of the issue, and will be rolling out a microcode fix next month to resolve it. ↫ Ryan Smith at AnandTech It turns out the root cause of the problem is &#8220;elevated operating voltages&#8221;, caused by a buggy algorithm in Intel&#8217;s own microcode. As such, it&#8217;s at least fixable through a microcode update, which Intel says it will ship sometime mid-August. AnandTech, my one true source for proper reporting on things like this, is not entirely satisfied, though, as they state microcode is often used to just cover up the real root cause that&#8217;s located much deeper inside the processor, and as such, Intel&#8217;s explanation doesn&#8217;t actually tell us very much at all. Quite coincidentally, Intel also experienced a manufacturing flaw with a small batch of very early Raptor Lake processors. An &#8220;oxidation manufacturing flaw&#8221; found its way into a small number of early Raptor Lake processors, but the company claims it was caught early and shouldn&#8217;t be an issue any more. Of course, for anyone experiencing issues with their expensive Intel processors, this will linger in the back of their minds, too. Not exactly a flawless launch for Intel, but it seems its main only competitor, AMD, is also experiencing issues, as the company has delayed the launch of its new Ryzen 9000 chips due to quality issues. I&#8217;m not at all qualified to make any relevant statements about this, but with the recent launch of the Snapdragon Elite X and Pro chips, these issues couldn&#8217;t come at a worse time for Intel and AMD.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-07-25, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

We're at a huge fork in the road. One fork -- goodbye USA, the other way, we're stronger than ever. We're in a good spot imho because Trump's tank is empty. He's old, tired, fat, addled, fetid, rotten. You have to work really hard not to see that. If it works, Biden will have stabilized the country, and Harris will erect the guardrails that make sure no one follows in Trump's path, and the Supreme Court gets back into its proper place. They've been overthrowing our society, economy and political system. That all has to be reversed before it does too much damage, and prevented in the future. I want to know why the court can't be expanded, and if Harris will put that in her platform.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-07-25, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

Software-wise I realized recently that everything that takes me away from creating really nice writing and publishing tools is a waste. I have to get off track because there are huge holes in the web as a runtime platform. And every year it gets worse as new incompatible languages are added, new incompatible stacks built. As a result we have to re-do everything all the time, and never get a chance to create new user experience. The market fragments, which is exactly what the tech companies want. It keeps their products from becoming commodities. And like it or not, the politicians and corporations don't want us writing too much, they just want us working, donating to their campaigns, paying taxes, buying their crap, and not getting all agitated about things they don't care about.

## 2024-07-24 Gridmapper Local

date: 2024-07-25, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-07-24-gridmapper-local">2024-07-24 Gridmapper Local</h1>

<p>I was wondering whether I should get back to Gridmapper, but not using Javascript and the web but using Common Lisp.
I spent some time on this <a href="2022-07-20_Gridmapper_CL">two years ago</a>.
Of course by now I have forgotten everything – like how to build it!</p>

<p>This is the Makefile that seems to work, given that I have both <code>gridmapper.asd</code> and <code>gridmapper.lisp</code> in the current directory.</p>

<pre><code>SHELL = /bin/sh
LISP ?= sbcl --non-interactive
PWD   = $(shell pwd)

build:
	$(LISP) --eval '(asdf:load-asd &quot;$(PWD)/gridmapper.asd&quot;)' \
	--eval '(asdf:load-system :gridmapper)' \
	--eval '(asdf:make :gridmapper)' \
	--eval '(quit)'
</code></pre>

<p>Surely there is a better way to do this?</p>

<p>If I replace <code>(asdf:load-system :gridmapper)</code> with <code>(ql:quickload :gridmapper)</code> it no longer gives me a warning about <code>cl-colors.asd</code> which I don&rsquo;t know anything about. I guess the warning is still preferable because it means no dependency on Quicklisp? I have no idea. The <a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/gridmapper-local.git">README</a> comes with a long explanation of what to install and how to do it, in order to build Gridmapper – including the use of Quicklisp.</p>

<p>The hairiest part is that I need access to a function that isn&rsquo;t exported from the Cairo package. So now I&rsquo;m accessing the private function (using two colons):</p>

<pre><code>;; Sorry for the ugly hack… cairo_format_stride_for_width is not exported.
(cairo::cairo_format_stride_for_width :CAIRO_FORMAT_ARGB32 (surface-width surface)))))
</code></pre>

<p>Two years ago, there was a different solution to this that apparently no longer works. 🤷</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Common_Lisp">#Common Lisp</a></p>

<p><strong>2024-07-25</strong>. Another option would be to switch to a different binding of the SDL2 library, of course.
<code>hu.dwim.sdl</code> sounds like the package I need? Sadly, there is no documentation. The SDL2 symbols are translated by the rules given into Common Lisp symbols. Given my lack of understanding, that makes it
difficult. Furthermore, the binding I&rsquo;ve been using until now came with hand-written convenience methods
such as <code>with-rects</code> that don&rsquo;t exist in this other binding. There is some porting to do. And given all
of that… I must confess that it makes me tired.</p>

<p>Using the browser as a universal user-interface is a pretty cool idea! Even if the application itself
is a stand-alone program that can act as a web-server (like <a href="Oddmu">Oddmu</a>), all the hard parts are abstracted
away: line-breaks, hyphenation, spell-checking when writing. Perhaps using the canvas is hard? But using
the DOM and SVG is something I&rsquo;ve done countless times and by now I know my way around.</p>

<p>Sigh.</p>

<p>I suspect something like the following is required for every symbol that I want to use:</p>

<pre><code>(defun render-fill-rect (&amp;rest args) (apply 'HU.DWIM.SDL.FFI::|SDL_RenderFillRect| args))
</code></pre>

<p>And then take a look at the arguments. The other SDL2 binding already has this.</p>

<p><code>rect.lisp</code> defines these:</p>

<pre><code>(defun make-rect (x y w h)
  &quot;Allocate and return a new SDL_Rect filled in with the arguments.&quot;
  (c-let ((rect sdl2-ffi:sdl-rect))
    (setf (rect :x) x
          (rect :y) y
          (rect :w) w
          (rect :h) h)
    rect))

(define-struct-accessors (rect sdl2-ffi:sdl-rect)
  :x :y (width :w) (height :h))
</code></pre>

<p><code>render.lisp</code> defines this:</p>

<pre><code>(defun render-fill-rect (renderer sdl-rect)
  &quot;Use this function to fill a rectangle on the current rendering target with
the drawing color. &quot;
  (check-rc (sdl2-ffi.functions:sdl-render-fill-rect renderer sdl-rect)))
</code></pre>

<p>So I am between a rock and a hard place.
The SDL2 bindings I had were pretty good.
They don&rsquo;t come with bindings for SDL2/gfx so I would I need to do the missing legwork myself.
Which I could do.</p>

<p>Or I could stick with Javascript and the web.</p>

<p>Sadly, the situation for the Cairo library doesn&rsquo;t appear to be much better.
The function <code>format-stride-for-width</code> is not exported and I suspect nobody is actively working on the library.
<a href="https://github.com/rpav/cl-cairo2/issues/25">My issue</a> has no reaction since Jul 20, 2022.</p>

## FreeBSD as a platform for your future technology

date: 2024-07-25, from: OS News

Choosing an operating system for new technology can be crucial for the success of any project. Years down the road, this decision will continue to inform the speed and efficiency of development.&#160;But should you build the infrastructure yourself or rely on a proven system? When faced with this decision, many companies have chosen, and continue to choose, FreeBSD. Few operating systems offer the immediate high performance and security of FreeBSD, areas where new technologies typically struggle. Having a stable and secure development platform reduces upfront costs and development time. The combination of stability, security, and high performance has led to the adoption of FreeBSD in a wide range of applications and industries. This is true for new startups and larger established companies such as Sony, Netflix, and Nintendo. FreeBSD continues to be a dependable ecosystem and an industry-leading platform. ↫ FreeBSD Foundation A FreeBSD marketing document highlighting FreeBSD&#8217;s strengths is, of course, hardly a surprise, but considering it&#8217;s fighting what you could generously call an uphill battle against the dominance of Linux, it&#8217;s still interesting to see what, exactly, FreeBSD highlights as its strengths. It should come as no surprise that its licensing model &#8211; the simple BSD license &#8211; is mentioned first and foremost, since it&#8217;s a less cumbersome license to deal with than something like the GPL. It&#8217;s philosophical debate we won&#8217;t be concluding any time soon, but the point still stands. FreeBSD also highlights that it&#8217;s apparently quite easy to upstream changes to FreeBSD, making sure that changes benefit everyone who uses FreeBSD. While I can&#8217;t vouch for this, it does seem reasonable to assume that it&#8217;s easier to deal with the integrated, one-stop-shop that is FreeBSD, compared to the hodge-podge of hundreds and thousands of groups whose software all together make up a Linux system. Like I said, this is a marketing document so do keep that in mind, but I still found it interesting.

## Re-introducing Participation Reports to encourage best practices in open metadata

date: 2024-07-25, from: Crossref Blog

<p>We’ve just released an update to our <a href="http://crossref.org/members/prep" target="_blank">participation report</a>, which provides a view for our members into how they are each working towards best practices in open metadata. Prompted by some of the signatories and organizers of the <a href="https://barcelona-declaration.org/" target="_blank">Barcelona Declaration</a>, which Crossref supports, and with the help of our friends at <a href="https://www.cwts.nl/" target="_blank">CWTS Leiden</a>, we have fast-tracked the work to include an updated set of metadata best practices in participation reports for our members. The reports now give a more complete picture of each member’s activity.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-we-mean-by-participation">What do we mean by ‘participation’?</h2>
<p>Crossref runs open infrastructure to link research objects, entities, and actions, creating a lasting and reusable scholarly record. As a not-for-profit with over 20,000 members in 160 countries, we drive metadata exchange and support nearly 2 billion monthly API queries, facilitating global research communication.</p>
<p>To make this system work, members strive to provide as much metadata as possible through Crossref to ensure it is openly distributed throughout the scholarly ecosystem at scale rather than bilaterally, thereby realizing the collective benefit of membership. Together, our membership provides and uses a rich nexus of information— known as <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/research-nexus">the research nexus</a>—on which the community can build tools to help progress knowledge.</p>
<p>Each member commits to certain terms, such as keeping metadata current, updating links for their DOIs to redirect to, linking references and other objects, and preserving their content in perpetuity. Beyond this, we also encourage members to register as much rich metadata as is relevant and possible.</p>
<p>Creating and providing richer metadata is a key part of participation in Crossref; we’ve long encouraged a more complete scholarly record, such as through <a href="https://metadata2020.org" target="_blank">Metadata 20/20</a>, and through supporting or leading initiatives for specific metadata, like open citations (I4OC), open abstracts (I4OA), open contributors (<a href="https://orcid.org" target="_blank">ORCID</a>), and open affiliations (<a href="https://ror.org" target="_blank">ROR</a>).</p>
<h2 id="which-metadata-elements-are-considered-best-practices">Which metadata elements are considered best practices?</h2>
<p>Alongside basic bibliographic metadata such as title, authors, and publication date(s), we encourage members to register metadata in the following fields:</p>
<div class="shortcode-divwrap ">
<span><figure><a href="https://crossref.org/members/prep/5401"><img src="https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/prep-2024.png"
alt="screenshot of Crossref participation report for member University of Szeged showing the 11 best practice metadata fields" width="70%"></a><figcaption>
<p>Example participation report for Crossref member University of Szeged</p>
</figcaption>
</figure></span>
</div>
<h4 id="references">References</h4>
<p>A list of all the references used by a work. This is particularly relevant for journal articles but the references can include any type of object, including datasets, versions, preprints, and more. Additionally, we encourage these to be added into <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/principles-practices/best-practices/relationships/">relationships</a>, where relevant.</p>
<h4 id="abstracts">Abstracts</h4>
<p>A description of the work. These are particularly useful for discovery systems that will promote the work, and are often used in downstream analyses such as for detecting integrity issues.</p>
<h4 id="contributor-ids-orcid">Contributor IDs (ORCID)</h4>
<p>All authors should be included in a work’s metadata, ideally alongside their verified ORCID identifier.</p>
<h4 id="affiliations--affiliation-ids-ror">Affiliations / Affiliation IDs (ROR)</h4>
<p>Members are able to register contributor affiliations as free text, but we are encouraging everyone to add ROR IDs for affiliations as the recommended best practice, as this differentiates and avoids mistyping. These two fields have newly been added to the participation reports interface in the most recent update.</p>
<h4 id="funder-ids-ofr">Funder IDs (OFR)</h4>
<p>Acknowledging the organization(s) that funded the work. We encourage the inclusion of <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/funder-registry/">Open Funder Registry</a> identifiers to make the funding metadata more usable. This will evolve into <a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/open-funder-registry-to-transition-into-research-organization-registry-ror/">an additional use case for ROR</a> over time.</p>
<h4 id="funding-award-numbers--grant-ids-crossref">Funding award numbers / Grant IDs (Crossref)</h4>
<p>A number or identifier assigned by the funding organization to identify the specific award of funding or other support such as use of equipment or facilities, prizes, tuition, etc. The <a href="https://www.crossref.org/services/grant-linking-system/">Crossref Grant Linking System</a> includes a unique persistent link that can be connected with outputs, activities, people, and organizations.</p>
<h4 id="crossmark">Crossmark</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://www.crossref.org/services/crossmark/">Crossmark service</a> gives readers quick and easy access to the current status of a record, including any corrections, retractions, or updates, via a button embedded on PDFs or a web article. Openly adding corrections, retractions, and errata is critical part of publishing, and the button provides readers with an easy in-context alert.</p>
<h4 id="similarity-check-urls">Similarity Check URLs</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://www.crossref.org/services/similarity-check/">Similarity Check service</a> helps editors to identify text-based plagiarism through our collective agreement for the membership to access to Turnitin’s powerful text comparison tool, iThenticate. Specific fill-text links are required to participate in this service.</p>
<h4 id="license-urls">License URLs</h4>
<p>URLs pointing to a license that explains the terms and conditions under which readers can access content. These links are crucial to denote intended downstream use.</p>
<h4 id="text-mining-urls">Text mining URLs</h4>
<p>Full-text URLs that help researchers in meta-science easily locate your content for text and data mining.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-participation-report">What is a participation report?</h2>
<p>Participation reports are are a visualization of the data representing members’ participation to the scholarly record which is available via our open REST API. There’s a separate participation report for each member, and each report shows what percentage of that member’s metadata records include 11 key metadata elements. These key elements add context and richness, and help to open up members work to easier discovery and wider and more varied use. As a member, you can use participation reports to see for yourself where the gaps in your organization’s metadata are, and perhaps compare your performance to others. Participation reports are free and open to everyone - so you can also check the report for any other members you are interested in.</p>
<p>We first <a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/321-its-lift-off-for-participation-reports/">introduced</a> participation reports in 2018. At the time, Anna Tolwinska and Kirsty Meddings wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Metadata is at the heart of all our services. With a growing range of members participating in our community—often compiling or depositing metadata on behalf of each other—the need to educate and express obligations and best practice has increased. In addition, we’ve seen more and more researchers and tools making use of our APIs to harvest, analyze and re-purpose the metadata our members register, so we’ve been very aware of the need to be more explicit about what this metadata enables, why, how, and for whom.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All of that still rings true today. But as the research nexus continues to evolve, so should the tools that intend to reflect it. For example, in 2022, we removed the <em>Open references</em> field from participation reports after <a href="blog/amendments-to-membership-terms-to-open-reference-distribution-and-include-uk-jurisdiction/">a board vote to change our policy and update the membership terms</a> meant that <em>all</em> references deposited with Crossref would be open by default. And now we’ve expanded the list of fields again, adding coverage data for contributor affiliation text and ROR identifiers.</p>
<h2 id="putting-it-in-practice">Putting it in practice</h2>
<p>To find out how you measure up when it comes to participation, type the name of your member organization into the <a href="https://www.crossref.org/members/prep/" target="_blank">search box</a>. You may be surprised by what you find—we often speak to members who thought they were registering a certain type of metadata for all their records, only to learn from their participation report that something is getting lost along the way.</p>
<p>You can only <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/register-maintain-records/maintaining-your-metadata/updating-your-metadata/">address</a> gaps in your metadata if you know that they exist.</p>
<p>More information, as well as a breakdown of the now 11 key metadata elements listed in every participation report and tips on improving your scores, is available in our <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/reports/participation-reports/">documentation</a>.</p>
<p>And if you have any questions or feedback, come talk to us on the <a href="https://community.crossref.org/" target="_blank">community forum</a> or request a metadata Health Check by emailing the <a href="mailto:feedback@crossref.org?subject=Participation%20reports%20and%20metadata%20health%20checks">community team</a>.</p>

## You can contribute to KDE with non-C++ code

date: 2024-07-24, from: OS News

Not everything made by KDE uses C++. This is probably obvious to some people, but it’s worth mentioning nevertheless. And I don’t mean this as just “well duh, KDE uses QtQuick which is written with C++ and QML”. I also don’t mean this as “well duh, Qt has a lot of bindings to other languages”. I mean explicitly “KDE has tools written primarily in certain languages and specialized formats”. ↫ Thiago Sueto If you ever wanted to contribute to KDE but weren&#8217;t sure if your preferred programming language or tools were relevant, this is a great blog post detailing how you can contribute if you are familiar with any of the following: Python, Ruby, Perl, Containerfile/Docker/Podman, HTML/SCSS/JavaScript, Web Assembly, Flatpak/Snap, CMake, Java, and Rust. A complex, large project like KDE needs people with a wide variety of skills, so it&#8217;s definitely not just C++. An excellent place to start.

## "Computer designs, back then": the story of ARRA, the first Dutch computer

date: 2024-07-24, from: Liam on Linux

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARRA_(computer)">ARRA</a> was the first ever Dutch computer.<br />&nbsp;<br />There's an account of its creation entitled <a href="https://ir.cwi.nl/pub/13534">9.2 Computers ontwerpen, toen</a>&nbsp;(<em>&quot;Computer Designs, then&quot;</em>)&nbsp;by the late&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carel_S._Scholten">Carel S Scholten</a>,&nbsp;but sadly for Anglophone readers it's in Dutch.<br /><br />This is a translation into English, done using ChatGPT 4o by Gavin Scott. I found it readable and fun, although I have no way to judge how accurate it is.<br /><br /><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">C.S. Scholten<br /><br /><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">In the summer of 1947, I was on vacation in Almelo. Earlier that year, on the same day as my best friend and inseparable study mate, Brain Jan Loopstra, I had successfully passed the qualifying exams in mathematics and physics. The mandatory brief introduction to the three major laboratories&mdash;the Physics Laboratory, the V.d. Waals Laboratory, and the Zeeman Laboratory&mdash;was behind us, and we were about to start our doctoral studies in experimental physics. For two years, we would be practically working in one of the aforementioned laboratories.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">One day, I received a telegram in Almelo with approximately the following content: &quot;Would you like to assist in building an automatic calculating machine?&quot; For assurance, another sentence was added: &quot;Mr. Loopstra has already agreed.&quot; The sender was &quot;The Mathematical Center,&quot; according to further details, located in Amsterdam. I briefly considered whether my friend had already confirmed my cooperation, but in that case, the telegram seemed unnecessary, so I dismissed that assumption. Both scenarios were equally valid: breaking up our long-standing cooperation (dating back to the beginning of high school) was simply unthinkable. Furthermore, the telegram contained two attractive points: &quot;automatic calculating machine&quot; and &quot;Mathematical Center,&quot; both new concepts to me. I couldn&rsquo;t deduce more than the name suggested. Since the cost of a telegram exceeded my budget, I posted a postcard with my answer and resumed my vacation activities. Those of you who have been involved in recruiting staff will, I assume, be filled with admiration for this unique example of recruitment tactics: no fuss about salary or working hours, not to mention irrelevant details like pension, vacation, and sick leave. For your reassurance, it should be mentioned that I was indeed offered a salary and benefits, which, in our eyes, were quite generous.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">I wasn't too concerned about how the new job could be combined with the mandatory two-year laboratory work. I believed that a solution had to be found for that. And a solution was found: the laboratory work could be replaced by our work at the Mathematical Center.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">Upon returning to Amsterdam, I found out the following: the Mathematical Center was founded in 1946, with a goal that could roughly be inferred from its name. One of the departments was the 'Calculation Department,' where diligent young ladies, using hand calculators&mdash;colloquially known as 'coffee grinders'&mdash;numerically solved, for example, differential equations (in a later stage, so-called 'bookkeeping machines' were added to the machinery). The problems dealt with usually came from external clients. The head of the Calculation Department was Dr. ir. A. van Wijngaarden. Stories about automatic calculating machines had also reached the management of the Mathematical Center, and it was clear from the outset that such a tool&mdash;if viable&mdash;could be of great importance, especially for the Calculation Department. However, it was not possible to buy this equipment; those who wanted to discuss it had to build it themselves. Consequently, it was decided to establish a separate group under the Calculation Department, with the task of constructing an automatic calculating machine. Given the probable nature of this group&rsquo;s activities, it was somewhat an oddity within the Mathematical Center, doomed to disappear, if not after completing the first machine, then certainly once this kind of tool became a normal trade object.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">We were not the only group in the Netherlands involved in constructing calculating machines. As we later discovered, Dr. W.L. v.d. Poel had already started constructing a machine in 1946.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">Our direct boss was Van Wijngaarden, and our newly formed two-man group was temporarily housed in a room of the Physics Laboratory on Plantage Muidergracht, where Prof. Clay was in charge. Our first significant act was the removal of a high-voltage installation in the room, much to the dismay of Clay, who was fond of the thing but arrived too late to prevent the disaster. Then we thought it might be useful to equip the room with some 220V sockets, so we went to Waterlooplein and returned with a second-hand hammer, pliers, screwdriver, some wire, and a few wooden (it was 1947!) sockets. I remember wondering whether we could reasonably submit the exorbitant bill corresponding to these purchases. Nonetheless, we did.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">After providing our room with voltage, we felt an unpleasant sensation that something was expected from us, though we had no idea how to start. We decided to consult the sparse literature. This investigation yielded two notable articles: one about the ENIAC, a digital (decimal) computer designed for ballistic problems, and one about a differential analyzer, a device for solving differential equations, where the values of variables were represented by continuously variable physical quantities, in this case, the rotation of shafts. The first article was abominably written and incomprehensible, and as far as we understood it, it was daunting, mentioning, for instance, 18,000 vacuum tubes, a number we were sure our employer could never afford. The second article (by V. Bush), on the other hand, was excellently written and gave us the idea that such a thing indeed seemed buildable.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">Therefore, it had to be a differential analyzer, and a mechanical one at that. As we now know, we were betting on the wrong horse, but first, we didn&rsquo;t know that, and second, it didn&rsquo;t really matter. Initially, we were not up to either task simply because we lacked any electronic training. We were supposed to master electricity and atomic physics, but how a vacuum tube looked inside was known only to radio amateurs among us, and we certainly were not. Our own (preliminary) practicum contained, to my knowledge, no experiment in which a vacuum tube was the object of study, and the physics practicum for medical students (the so-called 'medical practicum'), where we had supervised for a year as student assistants, contained exactly one such experiment. It involved a rectifier, dated by colleagues with some training in archaeology to about the end of the First World War. The accompanying manual prescribed turning on the 'plate voltage' only tens of seconds after the filament voltage, and the students had to answer why this instruction was given. The answers were sometimes very amusing. One such answer I won&rsquo;t withhold from you: 'That is to give the current a chance to go around once.'<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">Our first own experiment with a vacuum tube would not have been out of place in a slapstick movie. It involved a triode, in whose anode circuit we included a megohm resistor for safety. Safely ensconced behind a tipped-over table, we turned on the 'experiment.' Unlike in a slapstick movie, nothing significant happened in our case.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">With the help of some textbooks, and not to forget the 'tube manuals' of some manufacturers of these useful objects, we somewhat brushed up on our electronic knowledge and managed to get a couple of components, which were supposed to play a role in the differential analyzer, to a state where their function could at least be guessed. They were a moment amplifier and a curve follower. How we should perfect these devices so that they would work reliably and could be produced in some numbers remained a mystery to us. The solution to this mystery was never found. Certainly not by me, as around this time (January 1948), I was summoned to military service, which couldn&rsquo;t do without me. During the two years and eight months of my absence (I returned to civilian life in September 1950), a drastic change took place, which I could follow thanks to frequent contacts with Loopstra.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">First, the Mathematical Center, including our group, moved to the current building at 2nd Boerhaavestraat 49. The building looked somewhat different back then. The entire building had consisted of two symmetrically built schools. During the war, the building was requisitioned by the Germans and used as a garage. In this context, the outer wall of one of the gymnasiums was demolished. Now, one half was again in use as a school, and the other half, as well as the attic above both halves, was assigned to the Mathematical Center. The Germans had installed a munitions lift in the building. The lift was gone, but the associated lift shaft was not. Fortunately, few among us had suicidal tendencies. The frosted glass in the toilet doors (an old school!) had long since disappeared; for the sake of decorum, curtains were hung in front of them.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">Van Wijngaarden could operate for a long time over a hole in the floor next to his desk, corresponding with a hole in the ceiling of the room below (unoccupied). Despite his impressive cigar consumption at that time, I didn&rsquo;t notice that this gigantic ashtray ever filled up.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">The number of employees in our group had meanwhile expanded somewhat; all in all, perhaps around five.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">The most significant change in the situation concerned our further plans. The idea of a differential analyzer was abandoned as it had become clear that the future belonged to digital computers. Upon my return, a substantial part of such a computer, the 'ARRA' (Automatische Relais Rekenmachine Amsterdam), had already been realized. The main components were relays (for various logical functions) and tubes (for the flip-flops that composed the registers). The relays were Siemens high-speed relays (switching times in the order of a few milliseconds), personally retrieved by Loopstra and Van Wijngaarden from an English war surplus. They contained a single changeover contact (break-before-make), with make and break contacts rigidly set, although adjustable. Logically appealing were the two separate coils (with an equal number of windings): both the inclusive and exclusive OR functions were within reach. The relays were mounted on octal bases by us and later enclosed in a plastic bag to prevent contact contamination.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">They were a constant source of concern: switching times were unreliable (especially when the exclusive OR was applied) and contact degradation occurred nonetheless. Cleaning the contacts ('polishing the pins') and resetting the switching times became a regular pastime, often involving the girls from the Calculation Department. The setting was done on a relay tester, and during this setting, the contacts were under considerable voltage. Although an instrument with a wooden handle was used for setting, the curses occasionally uttered suggested it was not entirely effective.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">For the flip-flops, double triodes were used, followed by a power tube to drive a sufficient number of relays, and a pilot lamp for visual indication of the flip-flop state. Since the A had three registers, each 30 bits wide, there must have been about 90 power tubes, and we noted with dismay that 90 power tubes oscillated excellently. After some time, we knew exactly which pilot lamp socket needed a 2-meter wire to eliminate the oscillation.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">At a later stage, a drum (initially, the instructions were read from a plugboard via step switches) functioned as memory; for input and output, a tape reader (paper, as magnetic tape was yet to be invented) and a teleprinter were available. A wooden kitchen table served as the control desk.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">Relays and tubes might have been the main logical building blocks, but they were certainly not the only ones. Without too much exaggeration, it can be said that the ARRA was a collection of what the electronic industry had to offer, a circumstance greatly contributed to by our frequent trips to Eindhoven, from where we often returned with some 'sample items.' On the train back, we first reminisced about the excellent lunch we had enjoyed and then inventoried to determine if we brought back enough to cover the travel expenses. This examination usually turned out positive.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">It should be noted that the ARRA was mainly not clocked. Each primitive operation was followed by an 'operation complete' signal, which in turn started the next operation. It is somewhat amusing that nowadays such a system is sometimes proposed again (but hopefully more reliable than what we produced) to prevent glitch problems, a concept we were not familiar with at the time.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">Needless to say, the ARRA was so unreliable that little productive work could be done with it. However, it was officially put into use. By mid-1952, this was the case. His Excellency F.J. Th. Rutten, then Minister of Education, appeared at our place and officially inaugurated the ARRA with some ceremony. For this purpose, we carefully chose a demonstration program with minimal risk of failure, namely producing random numbers &agrave; la Fibonacci. We had rehearsed the demonstration so often that we knew large parts of the output sequence by heart, and we breathed a sigh of relief when we found that the machine produced the correct output. In hindsight, I am surprised that this demonstration did not earn us a reprimand from higher-ups. Imagine: you are the Minister of Education, thoroughly briefed at the Department about the wonders of the upcoming computing machines; you attend the official inauguration, and you are greeted by a group explaining that, to demonstrate these wonders, the machine will soon produce a series of random numbers. When the moment arrives, they tell you with beaming faces that the machine works excellently. I would have assumed that, if not with the truth, at least with me, they were having a bit of fun. His Excellency remained friendly, a remarkable display of self-control.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">The emotions stirred by this festivity were apparently too much for the ARRA. After the opening, as far as I recall, no reasonable amount of useful work was ever produced. After some time, towards the end of 1952, we decided to give up the ARRA as a hopeless case and do something else. There was another reason for this decision. The year 1952 should be considered an excellent harvest year for the Mathematical Center staff: in March and November of that year, Edsger Dijkstra and Gerrit Blaauw respectively appeared on the scene. Of these two, the latter is of particular importance for today's story and our future narrative. Gerrit had worked on computers at Harvard, under the supervision of Howard Aiken. He had also written a dissertation there and was willing to lend his knowledge and insight to the Mathematical Center. We were not very compliant boys at that time. Let me put it this way: we were aware that we did not have a monopoly on wisdom, but we found it highly unlikely that anyone else would know better. Therefore, the 'newcomer' was viewed with some suspicion. Gerrit&rsquo;s achievement was all the greater when he convinced us in a lecture of the validity of what he proposed. And that was quite something: a clocked machine, uniform building blocks consisting of various types of AND/OR gates and corresponding amplifiers, pluggable (and thus interchangeable) units, a neat design method based on the use of two alternating, separate series of clock pulses, and proper documentation.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">We were sold on the plan and got to work. A small difficulty had to be overcome: what we intended to do was obviously nothing more or less than building a new machine, and this fact encountered some political difficulties. The solution to this problem was simple: formally, it would be a 'revision' of the ARRA. The new machine was thus also called ARRA II (we shall henceforth speak of A II), but the double bottom was perfectly clear to any visitor: the frames of the two machines were distinctly separated, with no connecting wire between them.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">For the AND/OR gates, we decided to use selenium diodes. These usually arrived in the form of selenium rectifiers, a sort of firecrackers of varying sizes, which we dismantled to extract the individual rectifier plates, about half the diameter of a modern-day dime. The assembly&mdash;the selenium plates couldn't tolerate high temperatures, so soldering was out of the question&mdash;was as follows: holes were drilled in a thick piece of pertinax. One end of the hole was sealed with a metal plug; into the resulting pot hole went a spring and a selenium plate, and finally, the other end of the hole was also sealed with a metal plug. For connecting the plugs, we thought the use of silver paint was appropriate, and soon we were busy painting our first own circuits. Some time later, we had plenty of reasons to curse this decision. The reliability of these connections was poor, to put it mildly, and around this time, the 'high-frequency hammer' must have been invented: we took a small hammer with a rubber head and rattled it along the handles of the units, like a child running its hand along the railings of a fence. It proved an effective means to turn intermittent interruptions into permanent ones. I won't hazard a guess as to how many interruptions we introduced in this way. At a later stage, the selenium diodes were replaced by germanium diodes, which were simply soldered.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">The AND/OR gates were followed by a triode amplifier and a cathode follower. ARRA II also got a drum and a tape reader. For output, an electric typewriter was installed, with 16 keys operable by placing magnets underneath them. The decoding tree for these magnets provided us with the means to build an echo-check, and Dijkstra fabricated a routine where, simultaneously with printing a number, the same number (if all went well) was reconstructed. I assume we thus had one of the first fully controlled print routines. Characteristic of ARRA II&rsquo;s speed was the time for an addition: 20 ms (the time of a drum rotation).<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">ARRA II came into operation in December 1953, this time without ministerial assistance, but it performed significantly more useful work than its predecessor, despite the technical difficulties outlined above.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">The design phase of ARRA II marks for me the point where computer design began to become a profession. This was greatly aided by the introduction of uniform building blocks, describable in a multidimensional binary state space, making the use of tools like Boolean algebra meaningful. We figured out how to provide ARRA II with signed multiplicative addition for integers (i.e., an operation of the form (A,S) := (M) * (&plusmn;S') + (A), for all sign combinations of (A), (S), and (M) before and of the result), despite the fact that ARRA II had only a counter as wide as a register. As far as I can recall, this was the first time I devoted a document to proving that the proposed solution was correct. Undoubtedly, the proof was in a form I would not be satisfied with today, but still... It worked as intended, and you can imagine my amusement when, years later, I learned from a French book on computers that this problem was considered unsolvable.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">In May 1954, work began on a (slightly modified) copy of ARRA II, the FERTA (Fokker's First Calculating Machine Type A), intended for Fokker. The FERTA was handed over to Fokker in April 1955. This entire affair was mainly handled by Blaauw and Dijkstra. Shortly thereafter, Blaauw left the service of the Mathematical Center.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">In June 1956, the ARMAC (Automatic Calculating Machine Mathematical Center), successor to ARRA II, was put into operation, several dozen times faster than its predecessor. Design and construction took about 1&frac12; years. Worth mentioning is that the ARMAC first used cores, albeit on a modest scale (in total 64 words of 34 bits each, I believe). For generating the horizontal and vertical selection currents for these cores, we used large cores. To drive these large cores, however, they had to be equipped with a coil with a reasonable number of windings. Extensive embroidery work didn&rsquo;t seem appealing to us, so the following solution was devised: a (fairly deep) rim was turned from transparent plastic. Thus, we now had two rings: the rim and the core. The rim was sawed at one place, and the flexibility of the material made it possible to interlock the two rings. Then, the coil was applied to the rim by rotating it from the outside using a rubber wheel. The result was a neatly wound coil. The whole thing was then encased in Araldite. The unintended surprising effect was that, since the refractive indices of the plastic and Araldite apparently differed little, the plastic rim became completely invisible. The observer saw a core in the Araldite with a beautifully regularly wound coil around it. We left many a visitor in the dark for quite some time about how we produced these things!<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">The time of amateurism was coming to an end. Computers began to appear on the market, and the fact that our group, which had now grown to several dozen employees, did not really belong in the Mathematical Center started to become painfully clear to us. Gradual dissolution of the group was, of course, an option, but that meant destroying a good piece of know-how. A solution was found when the Nillmij, which had been automating its administration for some time using Bull punch card equipment, declared its willingness to take over our group as the core of a new Dutch computer industry. Thus it happened. The new company, N.V. Elektrologica, was formally established in 1956, and gradually our group&rsquo;s employees were transferred to Elektrologica, a process that was completed with my own transfer on January 1, 1959. As the first commercial machine, we designed a fully transistorized computer, the XI, whose prototype performed its first calculations at the end of 1957. The speed was about ten times that of the ARMAC.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">With this, I consider the period I had to cover as concluded. When I confront my memories with the title of this lecture, it must be said that 'designing computers' as such hardly existed: the activities that could be labeled as such were absorbed in the total of concerns that demanded our attention. Those who engaged in constructing calculating machines at that time usually worked in very small teams and performed all the necessary tasks. We decided on the construction of racks, doors, and closures, the placement of fans (the ARMAC consumed 10 kW!), we mounted power distribution cabinets and associated wiring, we knew the available fuses and cross-sections of electrical cables by heart, we soldered, we peered at oscillographs, we climbed into the machine armed with a vacuum cleaner to clean it, and, indeed, sometimes we were also involved in design.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">We should not idealize. As you may have gathered from the above, we were occasionally brought to the brink of despair by technical problems. Inadequate components plagued us, as did a lack of knowledge and insight. This lack existed not only in our group but globally the field was not yet mastered.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">However, it was also a fascinating time, marked by a constant sense of 'never before seen,' although that may not always have been literally true. It was a time when organizing overtime, sometimes lasting all night, posed no problem. It was a time when we knew a large portion of the participants in international computer conferences at least by sight!<o:p></o:p></p><br type="_moz" /><br /><br /><img src="https://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=liam_on_linux&ditemid=91041" width="30" height="12" alt="comment count unavailable" style="vertical-align: middle;"/> comments

## On goals, online projects, and the usefulness of money

date: 2024-07-24, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>I’m currently a <em>“<a href="https://getkirby.com/partners">Certified Kirby Partner</a>”</em>. Fancy title, I know. What that means is that I paid some money, last summer, to be listed on a website. This upcoming August, I will no longer be a <em>“Certified Kirby Partner”</em> because I am not going to pay money—again—to be listed on a website. But my certified status is not what I want to write about. It’s just an excuse to talk about the role money plays in achieving goals in the context of online projects.</p>
<p>Most online projects exist to fulfil a goal. Sometimes that goal is stated, sometimes it’s implied. And money may or may not be an aid in achieving said goal. I was chatting about online communities with <a href="https://kevquirk.com/blog">Kev</a> the other day and we both reached the same conclusion that in order to create something meaningful in that space it has to be a paid product. Not because you need that to make it sustainable financially but because a monetary commitment—even a small one—is a helpful tool to find people who are genuinely interested in what you’re creating. You’re not likely to spend money on something you don’t care about. So in that context, money is a helpful tool to achieve the goal of creating a small community of people who care about the shared space.</p>
<p>That same way of reasoning wouldn’t make sense for something like my <a href="https://peopleandblogs.com">People and Blogs</a> series. My goal with that project is to help as many people as possible rediscover the beauty of having a personal blog and owning your corner of the web, and to encourage a healthier way to live online. Making it a paid series wouldn’t help me reach that goal. It would probably be an obstacle. This is why I started the series knowing it was going to be a cost for me both in terms of time and in terms of actual money but it was one I was willing to sustain because I believe it’s important.</p>
<p>It’s easy for me to commit to paying money when stated goals and monetisation schemes are aligned. To bring it back to Kirby, I absolutely love it both as a tool and as a project. It’s been run fantastically for more than a decade by a great group of people and I have nothing but positive things to say about it. I plan to keep using it and buying licenses for as long as they stay in business. But it’s also why I won’t pay again to be a <em>“Certified Kirby Partner”</em>. Because there the stated goals and the monetisation scheme are not aligned. As they say, money talks.</p>                <hr>

## 2024-07-24 My ed, wondering

date: 2024-07-24, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-07-24-my-ed-wondering">2024-07-24 My ed, wondering</h1>

<p>Sometimes I have the urge to write a small editor, something like the kilo project: so small that it is barely usable. I also imagine it to have a sort of conversational UI – which I guess ed has? – if ed is your grumpiest of companions! – or maybe the M-x commands for emacs – and I guess I‘m looking at <a href="Odd%C2%B5">Oddµ</a> as a site generator and Markdown file server and I wonder: what sort of editor would I need to maintain this? What sort of minimal SVG editing capabilities would be nice to have?</p>

<p>What if I could use an ed-like &ldquo;conversational&rdquo; interface, with better prompts, wrapped in <code>readline</code> for ‹Up, Return› combos to repeat things, opening multiple files, switching between them, with completion or menus, and saving it all in one go.</p>

<p>I think I will install <code>rlwrap</code> as a first step and wrap <code>ed</code> and <code>mail</code> in it.</p>

<p>When I read the Wikipedia pages of <code>sam</code> and <code>acme</code> I get the feeling that the started out at the same point and then moved towards a different, full-screen, mouse-support paradigm.</p>

<p>What would my ed have, in addition to ed?</p>

<p>My ed would have the notion of &ldquo;units&rdquo;. Perhaps these can be defined by a separator marker, a regular expression. A &ldquo;line&rdquo; is a unit separated by a newline, or a &ldquo;beginning of line&rdquo; regular expression. A &ldquo;sentence&rdquo; is a unit separated by all sorts of punctuation followed by zero or more quotes and one or more spaces, and so on. A &ldquo;block&rdquo; is a unit separated by empty lines, or special line beginnings such as header markup or list item markup. A &ldquo;section&rdquo; is a unit separated by line beginnings with header markup. These unit names and the corresponding separators are defined in a file, per type, so that they can be changed.</p>

<p>File types are associated with file extensions or special matches (such as looking at the first two lines of a file).</p>

<p>My ed would have a config file so that it can be redefined in parts. For example, every file type has special, system dependent commands to &ldquo;render&rdquo; it, be it compilation, viewing, printing, etc. Perhaps mailcap could be an interesting option to fall back to.</p>

<p>My ed would be line oriented and still offer keyboard navigation using the arrows or vi-style keys. It would have two panes: the top one would show the file content and a cursor or the highlighted unit. The bottom one would be a command line history. The command line history shouldn&rsquo;t be a complete file buffer that can be edited, though, because the temporal ordering seems important to me.</p>

<p>The navigation commands can also be used to modify the selection. Ideally, using arrows to move, shift arrows to select, and typing commands would all work seamlessly.</p>

<p>My ed would have commands that are words or even phrases, and can defined more of them in files, and edit and &ldquo;source&rdquo; them into your session. It would have understandable errors.</p>

<p>My ed would have a snarf buffer or a clipboard to use for cut, copy and insert. Cutting and copying would work on whole units.</p>

<p>My ed would have infinite undo and redo and an auto-save file. Perhaps the auto-save file would contain the redo script.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m starting to wonder whether I&rsquo;m reinventing vi, here. 🤔</p>

## 2024-07-21 What was hard about the Oddµ architecture?

date: 2024-07-24, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-07-21-what-was-hard-about-the-oddµ-architecture">2024-07-21 What was hard about the Oddµ architecture?</h1>

<p>If you know Go, I think you&rsquo;ll find the architecture of Oddmu to be very traditional: There is a list of actions it knows how to handle when it serves a site on the web and a list of commands it understands when called from the shell. Everything involving HTML or the RSS feed uses a Go template.</p>

<p>There were two things that were tricky, in hindsight. I didn&rsquo;t know enough Go to know how best to do it and so it took me a long time to figure them out.</p>

<p>The first was what data to keep in memory. I didn&rsquo;t want search to involve a database so I experimented a lot with different ways of indexing the content. Trigrams? Full-text? And what about scoring? In the end, I dropped all of that. The only thing I keep in memory is a map of page names and page titles as well as a map of hashtags and pages. I find that searching titles and hashtags is what I do most often. For everything else, I search the files. This, of course, is much slower but for a site of ten thousand pages it&rsquo;s still fast enough. So figuring out how to do search was hard. Once I had this figured out, I discovered that keeping maps in memory when there are multiple Go routines being used by the web server means that I need locks. Both of my maps are in fact data structures that each contain a map and a lock. This was new to me and it took me a long time to realize that having the lock was important. For a while, I didn&rsquo;t have those locks. 😅</p>

<p>The second thing that took me a long time to get right is that I wanted pages to be served from Oddµ when it runs as a web server and I wanted to be able to edit files locally and upload them (using rsync, for example) while it was still running on the server. I didn&rsquo;t know about watching the filesystem for changes and had to learn how to do this: a watcher per directory, spawning new watchers when directories are created, and updating those maps I keep in memory as files are added, deleted or edited.</p>

<p>Watching the files introduced another complication, however: What if a user edited a page via the web? I already had code in place that would update my maps. Now the file system watcher would report the same file being written to, resulting in two updates. And what about a change to a file that results in multiple events: create a file, write something to the file, write some more to the file. Three events resulting in three updates? The code is therefore complicated.</p>

<p>If Oddµ knows that a file is going to change ahead of time, like when a user on the web saves an edit, the file is added to a map of ignored files for a second. When the file system watcher sees those changes, no updates are done because it knows that the edit handler already does it.</p>

<p>If Oddµ sees a file change because of somebody editing files directly, a one second timer is started. If another event for the same file arrives, the timer is reset to one second. Only when a second has elapsed without changes does the watcher do the updates to the internal data structures. That is to say, changes made to the file system regarding page title changes or hash tag changes take an effect on the web with a one second delay.</p>

<p>So now, with all that in place, think of all the go routines running in parallel. Every one second timer is a go routine. Every go routine accessing a map like the map if files to ignore means that this map needs to be a data structure containing a map and a lock.</p>

<p>When I look at that part of the code, I still get dizzy. 😵‍💫</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Oddµ">#Oddµ</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Programming">#Programming</a></p>

<p><strong>2024-07-21</strong>. <a class="account" href="https://merveilles.town/@bouncepaw" title="@bouncepaw@merveilles.town">@bouncepaw</a> asked about usability issues, specially in the context of using Oddµ for picture galleries. In my case, I think the hardest part is finding particular pictures. Consider <a href="2020-blumen/index">the page of flowers in 2020</a>. I know that there&rsquo;s a sanseveria in bloom on that page, for example. But how can I find it? I can find the page if I search for &ldquo;bogenhanf #pictures&rdquo;, and then I can search for the same word on the page, and then I have to wait for a bit as the browser lazy-loads pictures.</p>

<p>Perhaps, if I could get into the habit of putting the image description into the Markdown alt text, I could index all the images and their alt text, providing direct access to the images. I guess I would also have to add special code to the Markdown renderer that made the alt text visible for regular visitors (as title attribute or as regular paragraphs).
That&rsquo;d be interesting.</p>

<p><strong>Later</strong>. I have implemented something useful, I hope. If one of the search terms (excluding hashtags and predicates) matches an alt-text of an image, that image is included in the result.</p>

<p>Of course, almost none of my galleries use the alt-text, so right now there aren&rsquo;t many pages that will show results for a query like &ldquo;bogenhanf #pictures&rdquo;.</p>

<p>My expectations regarding alt texts and title attributes for images have changed significantly as I&rsquo;ve spent time on fedi, so I&rsquo;m really not sure what to do about Markdown in this respect. Right now I&rsquo;m in the habit of adding neither alt-text nor title attribute, trying to provide enough text in the paragraphs above or below. With this new search option, that might have to change, too. As a sighted person, I sort of expect the title attribute to be the same as the alt text.</p>

## New Samsung phones block sideloading by default

date: 2024-07-23, from: OS News

The assault on a user&#8217;s freedom to install whatever they want on what is supposed to be their phone continues. This time, it&#8217;s Samsung adding an additional blocker to users installing applications from outside the Play Store and its own mostly useless Galaxy Store. Technically, Android already blocks sideloading by default at an operating system level. The permission that’s needed to silently install new apps without prompting the user, INSTALL_PACKAGES, can only be granted to preinstalled app stores like the Google Play Store, and it’s granted automatically to apps that request it. The permission that most third-party app stores end up using, REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES, has to be granted explicitly by the user. Even then, Android will prompt the user every time an app with this permission tries to install a new app. Samsung’s Auto Blocker feature takes things a bit further. The feature, first introduced in One UI 6.0, fully blocks the installation of apps from unauthorized sources, even if those sources were granted the REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES permission. ↫ Mishaal Rahman I&#8217;m not entirely sure why Samsung felt the need to add an additional, Samsung-specific blocking mechanism, but at least for now, you can turn it off in the Settings application. This means that in order to install an application from outside of the Play Store and the Galaxy Store on brand new Samsung phones &#8211; the ones shipping with OneUI 6.1.1 &#8211; you need to both give the regular Android permission to do so, but also turn off this nag feature. Having two variants of every application on your Samsung phone wasn&#8217;t enough, apparently.

## Google won’t be deprecating third-party cookies from Chrome after all

date: 2024-07-23, from: OS News

This story just never ever ends. After delays, changes in plans, more delays, we now have more changed plans. After years of stalling, Google has now announced it is, in fact, not going to deprecate third-party cookies in Chrome by default. In light of this, we are proposing an updated approach that elevates user choice. Instead of deprecating third-party cookies, we would introduce a new experience in Chrome that lets people make an informed choice that applies across their web browsing, and they’d be able to adjust that choice at any time. We&#8217;re discussing this new path with regulators, and will engage with the industry as we roll this out. ↫ Anthony Chavez Google remains unclear about what, exactly, users will be able to choose between. The consensus seems to be that users will be able to choose between retaining third-party cookies and turning them off, but that&#8217;s based on a statement by the British Competition and Market Authority, and not on a statement from Google itself. It seems reasonable to assume the CMA knows what it&#8217;s talking about, but with a company like Google you never know what&#8217;s going to happen tomorrow, let alone a few months from now. While both Safari and Firefox have already made this move ages ago, it&#8217;s taking Google and Chrome a lot longer to deal with this issue, because Google needs to find different ways of tracking you that are not using third-party cookies. Google&#8217;s own testing with Privacy Sandbox, Chrome&#8217;s sarcastically-named alternative to third-party cookies, shows that it seems to perform reasonable well, which should definitely raise some alarm bells about just how private it really is. Regardless, I doubt this saga will be over any time soon.

## 2024-07-23 Eglot for Go, Perl and Markdown

<p>Note that LSP integration only works in a &ldquo;project&rdquo;: a VCS
repository, or in the case of Marksman, a directory containing an
(empty) <code>.marksman.toml</code> file. This latter option is important if
your notes aren&rsquo;t under version control.</p>

<p>After installing the Marksman binary, use something like the following.
This installs Eglot for Go mode, Perl mode and Markdown mode.</p>

## No, Southwest Airlines is not still using Windows 3.1

date: 2024-07-23, from: OS News

A story that&#8217;s been persistently making the rounds since the CrowdStrike event is that while several airline companies were affected in one way or another, Southwest Airlines escaped the mayhem because they were still using windows 3.1. It&#8217;s a great story that fits the current zeitgeist about technology and its role in society, underlining that what is claimed to be technological progress is nothing but trouble, and that it&#8217;s better to stick with the old. At the same time, anybody who dislikes Southwest Airlines can point and laugh at the bumbling idiots working there for still using Windows 3.1. It&#8217;s like a perfect storm of technology news click and ragebait. Too bad the whole story is nonsense. But how could that be? It&#8217;s widely reported by reputable news websites all over the world, shared on social media like a strain of the common cold, and nobody seems to question it or doubt the veracity of the story. It seems that Southwest Airlines running on an operating system from 1992 is a perfectly believable story to just about everyone, so nobody is questioning it or wondering if it&#8217;s actually true. Well, I did, and no, it&#8217;s not true. Let&#8217;s start with the actual source of the claim that Southwest Airlines was unaffected by CrowdStrike because they&#8217;re still using Windows 3.11 for large parts of their primary systems. This claim is easily traced back to its origin &#8211; a tweet by someone called Artem Russakovskii, stating that &#8220;the reason Southwest is not affected is because they still run on Windows 3.1&#8221;. This tweet formed the basis for virtually all of the stories, but it contains no sources, no links, no background information, nothing. It was literally just this one line. It turned out be a troll tweet. A reply to the tweet by Russakovskii a day later made that very lear: &#8220;To be clear, I was trolling last night, but it turned out to be true. Some Southwest systems apparently do run Windows 3.1. lol.&#8221; However, that linked article doesn&#8217;t cite any sources either, so we&#8217;re right back where we started. After quite a bit of digging &#8211; that is, clicking a few links and like 3 minutes of searching online &#8211; following the various reference and links back to their sources, I managed to find where all these stories actually come from to arrive at the root claim that spawned all these other claims. It&#8217;s from an article by The Dallas Morning News, titled &#8220;What’s the problem with Southwest Airlines scheduling system?&#8221; At the end of last year, Southwest Airlines&#8217; scheduling system had a major meltdown, leading to a lot of cancelled flights and stranded travelers just around the Christmas holidays. Of course, the media wanted to know what caused it, and that&#8217;s where this The Dallas Morning News article comes from. In it, we find the paragraphs that started the story that Southwest Airlines is still using Windows 3.1 (and Windows 95!): Southwest uses internally built and maintained systems called SkySolver and Crew Web Access for pilots and flight attendants. They can sign on to those systems to pick flights and then make changes when flights are canceled or delayed or when there is an illness. “Southwest has generated systems internally themselves instead of using more standard programs that others have used,” Montgomery said. “Some systems even look historic like they were designed on Windows 95.” SkySolver and Crew Web Access are both available as mobile apps, but those systems often break down during even mild weather events, and employees end up making phone calls to Southwest’s crew scheduling help desk to find better routes. During periods of heavy operational trouble, the system gets bogged down with too much demand. ↫ Kyle Arnold at The Dallas Morning News That&#8217;s it. That&#8217;s where all these stories can trace their origin to. These few paragraphs do not say that Southwest is still using ancient Windows versions; it just states that the systems they developed internally, SkySolver and Crew Web Access, look &#8220;historic like they were designed on Windows 95&#8221;. The fact that they are also available as mobile applications should further make it clear that no, these applications are not running on Windows 3.1 or Windows 95. Southwest pilots and cabin crews are definitely not carrying around pocket laptops from the &#8217;90s. These paragraphs were then misread, misunderstood, and mangled in a game of social media and bad reporting telephone, and here we are. The fact that nobody seems to have taken the time to click through a few links to find the supposed source of these claims, instead focusing on cashing in on the clicks and rage these stories would illicit, is a rather damning indictment of the state of online (tech) media. Many of the websites reporting on these stories are part of giant media conglomerates, have a massive number of paid staff, and they&#8217;re being outdone by a dude in the Arctic with a small Patreon, minimal journalism training, and some common sense. This story wasn&#8217;t hard to debunk &#8211; a few clicks and a few minutes of online searching is all it took. Ask yourself &#8211; why do these massive news websites not even perform the bare minimum?

All the reporters know the Repubs refused to fund border stuff so they could use it to tag the Dems in the election. So the first thing the Repubs do is tag VP Harris with the border. The reporter asks a Dem what they have to say about that. But the reporter <i>knows</i> what the Repubs did. So why do they even ask the freaking question? They just play the script the Repubs wrote for them. They are so savvy, but we heard all that too, so we know how corrupt they are. They don't care if we know.

## Podcast starts with linkblogging

date: 2024-07-23, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>A 20-minute morning coffee notes rambler <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/2024/07/23/randomMorningCoffeeNotes.m4a">podcast</a>, started with a narration of how we do linkblogging these days, mostly by hand, and how Bluesky is being hurt by not having a large-enough character limit. Another plea for textcasting, some standards for what we put on the wire over the social web.</p>
<p>Also talked about twitter-like systems, and idea borrowed from algol-like and lisp-like. </p>
<p>I talk about what made Unix so great. </p>
<p>Eric Raymond once told me that <a href="https://xmlrpc.com/">XML-RPC</a> was very much like Unix, and I said oh yeah, and so is <a href="http://reallysimple.org/">RSS</a> and the rest. Huge compliment because the simplicity of Unix is what I strive for, put huge time into. </p>
<p>Journos once said Apple is dead, but that was ridiculous because they had built a product that was just starting to grow and they had planted the seeds of huge growth in the 80s when they focused on selling to education, which made sure that kids when they grew up would have good feelings about Apple, and it totally worked. When the reporters were calling them dead, they were actually just about to boom in a whole new way, on the web, which the Mac was perfect for, given the built in simple networking. And then boom again when Jobs came back. And again with the iPod and then again with the iPhone. See how reporters miss the big picture. We shouldn't give them so much power, they pretend they know, but they are usually pretty clueless. </p>
<p>This podcast is also a demo of how my mind works. I flit around all over the place but also have learned over the years that if I want to get anything done I have to focus on one thing for at least a few hours every day, and string those days together. </p>
<p>I want to document this stuff for the benefit of young programmers. I learned a lot from reading the code of Unix, I always want to pay that back, the message is to strive for simplicity, keep technical debt to a minimum, and factor, factor and factor again to reduce technical debt. Those are the hardest projects, I'm doing one of those right now, but in the end it's worth it, because with simplicity you get to build higher.</p>

## Discussing Markdown and structured content with Niklas Begley

date: 2024-07-23, from: Blog by Fabrizio Ferri-Benedetti

<p>Last week I had the pleasure of conversing with Niklas Begley from Doctave. It was a follow-up to <a href="https://passo.uno/pros-cons-markdown/">The Pros and Cons of Markdown</a>, focused on why Markdown and other lightweight markup languages could benefit from some structure, in the DITA sense, but without going the XML way. Hint: There could be a bit of JSON schemas involved.</p>

This <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-lover-elon-musk-already-145940678.html">report</a> says that Musk is rate-limiting followers on that account.  Of course we <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/01/14/whatIfTwtrIsBoughtByARepub.html">warned</a> what could happen if a Republican bought twitter, but I didn't honestly contemplate that a fascist would. These days our greatest fears aren't scary enough. People laugh that Musk paid too much for twitter, but if the US ends up as an autocracy, the oligarch that owns the entire news distribution system for the world will probably have the last laugh. BTW, if you want to know why we're so thrilled to have Harris as the candidate, even though we didn't want Joe to give in, it's because no informed and sane person wants to live in a new Trump term. We tried that if you recall. The hope you hear now is much greater than the hope we had when Obama was selling that (though hope was a good word for it). Today it's the hope that we won't be deported or worse.

## Software Architecture in an AI World

date: 2024-07-23, from: O'Reilly Radar

Like almost any question about AI, “How does AI impact software architecture?” has two sides to it: how AI changes the practice of software architecture and how AI changes the things we architect. These questions are coupled; one can’t really be discussed without the other. But to jump to the conclusion, we can say that [&#8230;]

## 2024-07-23 ngIRCd and Munin

date: 2024-07-23, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-07-23-ngircd-and-munin">2024-07-23 ngIRCd and Munin</h1>

<p>Today I tried to make the <a href="https://github.com/munin-monitoring/contrib/blob/master/plugins/ircd/irc2">irc2</a> plugin work for my IRC server.</p>

<p>Mostly fiddling with the regular expressions. Adding an optional comma. Making it case-insensitive. The usual, I guess.</p>

<p>I was positively impressed by Debians pre-packaged Perl modules:</p>

<pre><code>apt install libpoe-component-irc-perl libpoe-component-sslify-perl
</code></pre>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the modified plugin for <code>/etc/munin/plugins</code>:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl
# -*- perl -*-

=head1 NAME

ircstats  - Plugin to graph data about an IRC network and a single IRC server

=head1 CONFIGURATION

- env.SERVER to point to the server to connect to, defaults to localhost.
- env.PORT port to use, defaults to 6667.
- env.NICK nickname to use, defaults to munin-$HASH.
- env.USESSL 0 or 1 values to enable SSL/TLS, defaults to 0.
- env.USEIPV6 0 or 1 to enable IPv6 use, defaults to 0.

=head1 USAGE

This plugin connects to an IRC server.

It requires POE::Component::IRC and POE::Component::SSLify if you use SSL/TLS.

<p data-sourcepos="1:1-2:66" dir="auto">You are right, there is too much code for this in static analyzers, and (at least) without cfg and dfa it is difficult to make any assumptions. But do we need recursion (in practice, not theoretically) for operators?
Maybe it&#39;s worth adding a {recursive} modifier to allow recursion?</p>

## Why The Llama 3.1 Announcement Is Huge

date: 2024-07-23, updated: 2024-07-23, from: Tom Kellog blog

Today Meta announced a new LLM, Llama 3.1 405B and along with it, a great letter by
Mark Zuckerburg about why open source is good for developers, Meta &amp; the world.
It might seem redundant, amidst the flood of other AI models being released, but I do think this
is a big moment, for 4 reasons.

## A brief history of Dell UNIX

date: 2024-07-22, from: OS News

“Dell UNIX? I didn’t know there was such a thing.” A couple of weeks ago I had my new XO with me for breakfast at a nearby bakery café.&#160;Other patrons were&#160;drawn to seeing an XO for the first time, including a Linux person from Dell. I mentioned Dell UNIX and we talked a little about the people who had worked on Dell UNIX. He expressed surprise that mention of Dell UNIX evokes the above quote so often and pointed out that Emacs source still has #ifdef for Dell UNIX. Quick Googling doesn’t reveal useful history of Dell UNIX, so here’s my version, a summary of the three major development releases. ↫ Charles H. Sauer I sure had never heard of Dell UNIX, and despite the original version of the linked article being very, very old &#8211; 2008 &#8211; there&#8217;s a few updates from 2020 and 2021 that add links to the files and instructions needed to install, set up, and run Dell UNIX in a virtual machine; 86Box or VirtualBox specifically. What was Dell UNIX? in the late &#8217;80s, Dell started a the Olympic project, an effort to create a completely new architecture spanning desktops, workstations, and servers, some of which would be using multiple processors. When searching for an operating system for this project, the only real option was UNIX, and as such, the Olympic team set out to developer a UNIX variant. The first version was based on System V Release 3.2, used Motif and the X Window System, a DOS virtual machine to run, well, DOS applications called Merge, and compatibility with Microsoft Xenix. It might seem strange to us today, but Microsoft&#8217;s Xenix was incredibly popular at the time, and compatibility with it was a big deal. The Olympic project turned out to be too ambitious on the hardware front so it got cancelled, but the Dell UNIX project continued to be developed. The next release, Dell System V Release 4, was a massive release, and included a full X Window System desktop environment called X.desktop, an office suite, e-mail software, and a lot more. It also contained something Windows wouldn&#8217;t be getting for quite a few years to come: automatic configuration of device drivers. This was apparently so successful, it reduced the number of support calls during the first 90 days of availability by 90% compared to the previous release. Dell SVR4 finally seemed like real UNIX on a PC. We were justifiably proud of the quality and comprehensiveness, especially considering that our team was so much smaller than those of our perceived competitors at ISC, SCO and Sun(!). The reviewers were impressed. Reportedly, Dell SVR4 was chosen by Intel as their reference implementation in their test labs, chosen by Oracle as their reference Intel UNIX implementation, and used by AT&#38;T USL for in house projects requiring high reliability, in preference to their own ports of SVR4.0. (One count showed Dell had resolved about 1800 problems in the AT&#38;T source.) I was astonished one morning in the winter of 1991-92 when Ed Zander, at the time president of SunSoft, and three other SunSoft executives arrived at my office, requesting Dell help with their plans to put Solaris on X86. ↫ Charles H. Sauer Sadly, this would also prove to be the last release of Dell UNIX. After a few more point release, the brass at Dell had realised that Dell UNIX, intended to sell Dell hardware, was mostly being sold to people running it on non-Dell hardware, and after a short internal struggle, the entire project was cancelled since it was costing them more than it was earning them. As I noted, the article contains the files and instructions needed to run Dell UNIX today, on a virtual machine. I&#8217;m definitely going to try that out once I have some time, if only to take a peek at that X.desktop, because that looks absolutely stunning for its time.

<span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">The state of Docker on popular RISC-V platforms</span>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>I've been testing a <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/sbc-reviews/issues/47">Milk-V Jupiter</a> this week, and have tested a number of other RISC-V development boards over the past two years.</p>

<p>As with any new CPU architecture, software support and ease of adoption are extremely important if you want to reach a wider audience. I wouldn't expect every developer and SBC hobbyist to be able to compile the Linux kernel, and the need to compile much of anything these days is getting rare. So having any instance where one <em>has</em> to know how to tweak a Makefile or pass in different flags to a compiler is a bit of a turn-off for platform adoption.</p>

<p>So one thing I've followed closely is how easy it is for me to get my own software running on RISC-V boards. It's one thing to run some vendor-provided demos. It's another entirely to take my real-world applications and infrastructure apps, and get them to work without hassle.</p>

<p>And to that end, Docker and Ansible, two tools I use extensively for dev/ops work, both run stably—though with plenty of caveats since RISC-V is still so new.</p></div>

## OpenBSD workstation for the people

date: 2024-07-22, from: OS News

This is an attempt at building an OpenBSD desktop than could be used by newcomers or by people that don’t care about tinkering with computers and just want a working daily driver for general tasks. Somebody will obviously need to know a bit of UNIX but we’ll try to limit it to the minimum. ↫ Joel Carnat An excellent, to-the-point, no-nonsense guide about turning a default OpenBSD installation into a desktop operating system running Xfce. You definitely don&#8217;t need intimate, arcane knowledge of OpenBSD to follow along with this one.

## Mismatch

date: 2024-07-22, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>My current life situation is not great. For a variety of reasons that aren't worth listing here. It's not like everything's bad. Some aspects of my life are great. But overall, I'd not say I'm in a happy place. Which is fine, or at least it would be fine if the root cause of the problem was known. Because when you know the cause of a problem you can work towards a solution. But up until the other day, I didn't know why I was feeling this way. And when you're in that situation, you feel hopeless and you can see things slowly spiralling out of control. But the other day, I had a realisation: a mismatch. That's why I feel this way. I realised that there's a mismatch between the way I see myself, the way I perceive myself as a person, and who I actually am. And that mismatch is driving me insane. There are things I know about myself, or at least I think I know about myself, that are important to me. And those things should play a role in the way I live my life. And yet because of this stupid mismatch, those things weren't playing a role and were superseded by other things I absolutely despise. And this mismatch manifests in subtle ways.</p>
<p>I am a morning person. I know it. I experimented with it and I know for a fact that I'm happier, more productive and live a better life when I wake up early. Not once, when up early, I thought "Why am I already awake? Shouldn't I be sleeping?". That's just not a thought I have because I know how much more I enjoy life when I'm up early. But late at night? That's a constant thought. I'm sitting there, reading something online and I constantly think "Why am I here reading this? I should be sleeping". And in doing that, in staying up late, the mismatch gathers strength. It's a vicious cycle.</p>
<p>That's one example but I'm realising that this is the source of all my struggles. And it's not much the fact that I am not the person I'd love to be—or that I think I am—but the fact that I don't do the things that I should be doing in order to become that person. And it fucking sucks. It sucks because I know that's going to be incredibly hard to correct that but at the same time I'm glad that at least now I know where the problem is and I can work towards a solution.</p>                <hr>

## I'm from Queens too

date: 2024-07-22, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I grew up in the same part of Queens as Trump, about ten years after he did. His family was in Jamaica, mine in Flushing. Here's a <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/2931+170th+Street,+Queens,+NY/85-15+Wareham+Pl,+Jamaica,+NY+11432/@40.74413,-73.7982607,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c28a8078136589:0xcdf1c8651455269a!2m2!1d-73.7948958!2d40.7696471!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c2611ad4d2c6a5:0xfe60c1b9262c3e04!2m2!1d-73.7858048!2d40.7170409!3e0?entry=ttu">map</a> that shows you where the two houses are. 4.0 miles apart if you take <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia_Parkway">Utopia Parkway</a>. A great name for a street, but it's not a parkway and it's nice but definitely not a utopia.</p>
<p>People who aren't from huge cities like New York don't know that Trump what our losers look like. They probably have their own loser types. I think that's where 99% of the confusion is. They really don't believe he's so bad. Don't hold that against them, that's nowhere near as bad as knowing what he is and being okay with that. </p>
<p>He's a mean bully type. The name-calling is a big clue. Distracts from <i>his</i> weaknesses, which are very obvious. I don't believe in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_shaming">body shaming</a>, because I care about other people's feelings. If I criticize his appearance it might reflect poorly on nice people who have his body type who may not be mean bully losers like Trump. </p>
<p>He's also a really good comedian if you don't think he wants to have the power to kill millions of people and control many more people. Last time he was our president just through incompetence, without trying, he was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Americans in the Covid disaster. He also wanted the army shoot protestors, that's the mean part of our former president. Luckily the people who worked for him told him to fuck off. They saved us from going into a very deep hole that would have been hard to escape from.</p>
<p>I watched the coverage of the aftermath of the assassination attempt, and listened to the Americans they interviewed, not the actors they put behind him on stage, to make him look like a badass I guess, these were just normal people who mostly like Trump, but seem pretty likeable themselves. The one thing you heard over and over was how If you don't like a candidate vote against them don't shoot them. That's American and it's not fascist at all. I don't think they know that he wants to make big changes in how our politics work. People think if he's bad they can just vote him out next time. He tells them this will be the last election if he wins, he actually says that, but somehow it doesn't seem to register. </p>
<p><div class="divInlineImage"><center><img class="imgInline" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/07/22/massDeportationNow.png"></center>Do Trump supporters understand what they support?</div></p>
<p>Of course the journalists are distorting who Trump supporters are. Trump is deplorable if you take him at his word. Some of Trump's followers are deplorable too, like the ones who rioted at our Capitol and January 6 and the people who are lined up to work in his next administration if he wins. They are awful people who want to control all of us. They're already doing it via the Supreme Court. It's going to get a lot worse if we go the wrong way. We shouldn't accept that we're horribly divided. The powerful media people want us to be divided, I don't know why and I don't care, I just know they do, based on their actions. </p>
<p>Anyway I know we're at a high moment, we're excited, and I'm going to enjoy the feeling. We all seem to be pulling the same way, at least on "our side" but I hold out hope that being an American still means something, that we can be friends, and fellow countrymen, and work together. I think that's still our greatest challange and our greatest opportunity. Yeah I am woke, that means I care about all of us. I think most of us do no matter who you vote for.</p>

## 2024-07-20 Bots again

date: 2024-07-22, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-07-20-bots-again">2024-07-20 Bots again</h1>

<p>Today I couldn&rsquo;t log into the server. <code>ssh</code> just sat there, waiting for the server. Some web page loaded a few bytes and stopped. I knew it: some idiot had once again written a bot that was hitting my web apps (also known as &ldquo;expensive endpoints&rdquo;) because they ignored all the rules. They also didn&rsquo;t get caught by fail2ban because of they were using cloud services, of course. And the only thing that helps against these fuckers is banning the whole network. Time to get working.</p>

<p>First, I had to reboot the server via the website of my service provider.</p>

<p>Then I had to figure out which app it was. It&rsquo;s impossible for me to find out. All my expensive apps are from a directory called <code>/home/alex/farm</code>.</p>

<p>When I look at the system log file I, find entries like these:</p>

<pre><code>grep &quot;Out of memory&quot; /var/log/syslog | tail | cut -b 72-

</code></pre>

<p>This is not helping. Who is 12041? There are large lists of the process identifiers and some numbers in the log, but the name is always shortened:</p>

<pre><code>grep &quot;12041&quot; /var/log/syslog | tail -n 3

</code></pre>

<p>Useless.</p>

<p>By that time, however, the system was slowing down again.
I fired up <code>htop</code> and saw a gazillion instances of the Community Wiki script.
Looking at the <code>/etc/log/apache2/access.log</code> file shows that bots were requesting the edit pages (!) of all the thousands of Community Wiki pages.</p>

<p>Thanks, idiots.</p>

<p>I needed to find where these requests where coming from.
My <a href="https://alexschroeder.ch/admin/leech-detector">leech-detector</a> script was as limited to single IP numbers as fail2ban.
So the first order of business was to add some functionality:
If given the option <code>--networks</code>, it now looks up the network range the requests come from and reports those:</p>

<pre><code>tail -n 50 /var/log/apache2/access.log | grep communitywiki | bin/admin/leech-detector --networks
</code></pre>

<p>This is expensive, of course, so I try to cache the <a href="https://www.routeviews.org/routeviews/index.php/collectors/">Route View ASN lookups</a> but the cache doesn&rsquo;t persist between calls. Using a small number of rows is the correct approach, here.</p>

<p>The result is a table like the one below. When I ran it, I used 400 rows or so.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="right">IP</th>
<th align="right">Hits</th>
<th align="right">Bandw.</th>

<li>220.184.0.0 → Zhejiang Telecom</li>
</ul>

<p>I think you know where this is going.</p>

<p>And so I copying the network IP, calling <code>whois</code>, verifying that it was Chinese Telecom or related, and added it to my <a href="https://alexschroeder.ch/admin/ban-cidr">ban-cidr</a> script.
(Note how I&rsquo;m using <code>netfilter-persistent</code> these days so that I don&rsquo;t have to run <code>ban-cidr</code> after every server restart.)</p>

<p>And now I&rsquo;m going to add the ranges above to the script.</p>

<p>Some days I feel like I&rsquo;m slowly starting to ban the whole commercial cloud service internet because nothing good ever seems to come of it. Do you feel the same?</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Administration">#Administration</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Bots">#Bots</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Butlerian_Jihad">#Butlerian Jihad</a></p>

<p><strong>2024-07-22</strong>. Here&rsquo;s another slight annoyance, for <code>ngircd</code>. There are a lot of log lines for a day:</p>

<pre><code>journalctl --unit ngircd.service|grep &quot;Jul 21&quot;|wc -l
7436
</code></pre>

<p>More than half of them come from a single IP hosted by Octopuce:</p>

<pre><code>journalctl --unit ngircd.service|grep &quot;Jul 21.*2001:67c:288:2::231&quot;|wc -l
4347
</code></pre>

<p>They all have this format:</p>

<pre><code>Jul 21 11:39:51 sibirocobombus ngircd[594]: Accepted connection 16 from &quot;[2001:67c:288:2::231]:41240&quot; on socket 8.
Jul 21 11:39:51 sibirocobombus ngircd[594]: Using X509 credentials from slot 0
Jul 21 11:39:51 sibirocobombus ngircd[594]: Shutting down connection 16 (SSL accept error, closing socket) with &quot;[2001:67c:288:2::231]:41240&quot; ...
Jul 21 11:39:51 sibirocobombus ngircd[594]: Client unregistered (connection 16): SSL accept error, closing socket.
Jul 21 11:39:51 sibirocobombus ngircd[594]: Connection 16 with &quot;[2001:67c:288:2::231]:41240&quot; closed (in: 0.0k, out: 0.0k).
</code></pre>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to try and use <code>fail2ban</code> for this.</p>

<p>Looks like this is happening every 10 seconds:</p>

<pre><code>journalctl --unit ngircd.service|grep &quot;Jul 21.*Shutting down&quot;|tail|cut -d ' ' -f 3
23:58:23
23:58:33
23:58:43
23:58:53
23:59:03
23:59:13
23:59:23
23:59:33
23:59:43
23:59:53
</code></pre>

<p>So here&rsquo;s my attempt at a filter, <code>/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/ngircd.conf</code>:</p>

<pre><code># Fail2Ban filter for failed ssl connections to the ngIRC daemon

[INCLUDES]
# Read common prefixes. If any customizations available -- read them from
# common.local
before = common.conf

[Definition]
# Example:
# Shutting down connection 16 (SSL accept error, closing socket) with &quot;[2001:67c:288:2::231]:44846&quot;
_daemon = ngircd
failregex = ^%(__prefix_line)sShutting down connection [0-9]+ \(SSL accept error, closing socket\) with &quot;&lt;HOST&gt;:[0-9]+&quot; \.\.\.$
ignoreregex = 

[Init]
journalmatch = _SYSTEMD_UNIT=ngircd.service + _COMM=ngircd

# Author: Alex Schroeder
</code></pre>

<p>And this is the jail, <code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/ngircd.conf</code> – and here I want to ban them after four failed connects in a minute.
Remember the default ban lasts 10 minutes. Since this attack is moving so slowly, I want to increase this ban time to an hour.</p>

<pre><code>[ngircd]
enabled = true
findtime = 60
maxretry = 4
bantime = 60m
</code></pre>

<p>Let&rsquo;s give it a try!</p>

<pre><code>systemctl reload fail2ban
</code></pre>

<p>Then again: fail2ban is only for future attacks. The current level of persistency also deserves its own treatment:</p>

<pre><code>ipset create banlist6 hash:net family inet6
ip6tables -I INPUT -m set --match-set banlist6 src -j DROP
ip6tables -I FORWARD -m set --match-set banlist6 src -j DROP
ipset add banlist6 2001:67c:288:2::231
</code></pre>

<p>There we go.</p>

<p>Oh, and as soon as I did that, it switched to 91.194.61.231, but only once every two or three minutes.
Still Octopuce, though.</p>

<pre><code>ipset add banlist 91.194.60.0/23
</code></pre>

<p><strong>2024-07-22</strong>. Back to Community Wiki and its enemies, however.</p>

## New Podcast Talking Postgres

date: 2024-07-22, from: PostgreSQL News

<h2>What is Talking Postgres?</h2>
<p><a href="https://talkingpostgres.com">Talking Postgres with Claire Giordano</a> is a monthly podcast where we talk about the human side of Postgres, databases, and open source. Previously called “Path To Citus Con”, each of the 17 episodes published so far includes 1 or 2 amazing guests from the Postgres world. As for the new Talking Postgres name, it’s been called “a sensible move”, “a great name”, and “more fitting”—since the episodes are all about Postgres things. </p>
<ul>
<li>Talking Postgres is available <a href="https://talkingpostgres.com/">via most podcast apps</a> and also <a href="https://aka.ms/TalkingPostgres-playlist">on YouTube</a>. </li>
<li>Catch up on the past 17 episodes at <a href="https://talkingpostgres.com">talkingpostgres.com</a>.</li>
<li>You can also <a href="https://talkingpostgres.com/subscribe">subscribe</a> to make sure you never miss an episode. And yes, there is an RSS feed on the subscribe page.</li>
</ul>

## Metadata schema development plans

date: 2024-07-22, from: Crossref Blog

<h2 id="its-been-a-while-heres-a-metadata-update-and-request-for-feedback">It’s been a while, here’s a metadata update and request for feedback</h2>
<p>In Spring 2023 we sent out a <a href="https://community.crossref.org/t/take-our-metadata-priorities-survey-by-may-18/3498" target="_blank">survey</a> to our community with a goal of assessing what our priorities for metadata development should be - what projects are our community ready to support? Where is the greatest need? What are the roadblocks?</p>
<p>The intention was to help prioritize our metadata development work. There’s a lot we want to do, a lot our community needs from us, but we really want to make sure we’re focusing on the projects that will have the most immediate impact for now.</p>
<p>Several projects were proposed, based on community demand over time. All are projects we intend to support long-term.</p>
<h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>
<p>The projects included in the survey were:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Alternate names</strong> - We proposed adding a repeatable ‘name’ element to allow for names that aren’t separated by given/family/surname.</li>
<li><strong>Updates to funding data</strong> -<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/roring-ahead-using-ror-in-place-of-the-open-funder-registry/" target="_blank">this update</a> will be released in the near future and includes:
<ul>
<li>Expand ROR support - Allow members to supply ROR ID instead of funder ID in funding data and grant records.</li>
<li>Include Grant DOIs in funding metadata.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Publication typing in citations</strong> - Support citation type in citation metadata (for example article, preprint, data, software, etc.).</li>
<li><strong>Expand contributor role support</strong> - Allow multiple contributor roles to be provided per contributor and add support for external vocabularies (like CRediT)</li>
<li><strong>Expand abstract support</strong> - We currently require all abstracts to be formatted using JATS. We will be adding new abstract formats, including BITS and ONIX (which have been requested), as well as a generic abstract format (non-JATS).</li>
<li><strong>Statements</strong> - Add support for free text statements such as data availability, acknowledgments, funding, and conflict of interest.</li>
<li><strong>Contributor identifiers</strong> - Accept contributor identifiers such as ISNI (in addition to ORCID, which is already supported).</li>
<li><strong>Conference event IDs</strong> - Identifiers for <a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/taking-the-con-out-of-conferences/" target="_blank">conference events</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h2>
<p>There is a clear preference for publication types in citations and abstract markup, expanded support for multilingual metadata, followed by expanding contributor roles to support multiple roles and the CRediT taxonomy. The results have helped us prioritize our work and we’re advancing several projects soon based on our readiness to move forward.</p>
<p>First up is <strong>publication typing in citations and statements</strong> - we hope to be able to make this ready for registration in the coming months, but want to confirm a few things first, primarily the list of ‘types’ to apply to citations, so please review and comment: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1VPXhTPMZzfvAPmTOlNp-bZf9cTLkw0dPZFTuDtDIPls/edit" target="_blank">Metadata updates in need of feedback July 2024</a></p>
<p>We also have been discussing expansions to our <strong>support for preprints metadata</strong> with our <a href="https://www.crossref.org/working-groups/preprints/" target="_blank">Preprints Advisory Group</a> and have a number of preprint-specific updates that will be rolled out in the coming months as well, including support for versions and status. These proposed changes are also available for comment.</p>
<p>And finally, we will be expanding <strong>support for contributor roles</strong> to include multiple roles per contributor, as well as adding support for the <a href="https://credit.niso.org/" target="_blank">CRediT</a> taxonomy. This update is yet to be scheduled but we do have the inputs and output planning done and welcome any comments on this as well.</p>
<p>We will also be continuing work on other projects highlighted in the survey that aren’t quite ready to go:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Multilingual metadata</strong>: Support for multilingual metadata in particular is very important and will require a fairly significant technical effort, so we want to be sure we get this right - at minimum we need to include repeatable fields flagged with language metadata for most items, there may be other considerations as well such as the scope of languages supported.</p>
<p>As we develop new metadata segments we’re keeping language metadata in mind, but I’d like to form a short-term working group to help shape this update - this group will be focused on the details of supporting multilingual metadata in our inputs and outputs, so conversations will be very XML and JSON heavy. If you are interested and available please contact <a href="mailto:pfeeney@crossref.org">pfeeney@crossref.org</a>. <p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Abstract markup:</strong> we are currently in the research phase of this project but will be proposing updates and asking for input this fall. At the moment support for BITS and ONIX abstracts have been requested, as well as an agnostic format.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Expansion of name and contributor ID support</strong>: work is under way for this as well, and I should have inputs and outputs for feedback in the coming months.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We anticipate more developments and requests for feedback in the future as we still have other projects from the list above to get to. I’ve opened up a ‘<a href="https://community.crossref.org/c/metadata-development/15" target="_blank">Metadata Development</a>’ section in our Community Forum to invite discussion and will be kicking off a renewed Metadata Interest Group in the fall.</p>

<p>The circular economy – the newest magical word in the sustainable development vocabulary – promises economic growth without environmental destruction or waste. However, growth makes a circular economy impossible, even if we recycle all raw materials and all recycling is 100% efficient. No technology can change that because it&rsquo;s not a technological problem. In addition, many modern products are too complex to recycle.</p>
<p>In this series of articles, LOW←TECH MAGAZINE explores how the circularity of various technologies like bicycles, solar panels, and wind turbines evolves. Placing the recycling of resources in a historical context makes clear that we are not moving toward a circular economy but rather increasingly away from it.</p>

## Episode 136 - Getting On TRAC

date: 2024-07-21, from: Advent of Computing

<p>Have you ever formed a bad first impression? Way back when I formed a hasty impression of this language called TRAC. It's been called a proto-esoteric language, and for good reason. It's outlandish, complex, and confounding. But, after the urging of some listeners, I've decided to give TRAC a second look. What I've found is, perhaps, more confusing than I ever imagined. This episode we are looking at the wild history of TRAC, how it actually pioneered some good ideas, and why it feels so alien.</p> <p>Selected Sources:</p> <p><a href= "https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/800197.806048">https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/800197.806048</a> - 1965 TRAC paper</p> <p><a href= "https://github.com/gmilmei/trac64">https://github.com/gmilmei/trac64</a> - TRAC64 processor in "modern" C</p> <p><a href= "https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/365230.365270">https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/365230.365270</a> - 1966 TRAC paper, with more code!</p>

## OpenBSD gets hardware accelerated video decoding/encoding

date: 2024-07-21, from: OS News

Only yesterday, I mentioned one of the main reasons I decided to switch back to Fedora from OpenBSD were performance issues &#8211; and one of them was definitely the lack of hardware acceleration for video decoding/encoding. The lack of such technology means that decoding/encoding video is done using the processor, which is far less efficient than letting your GPU do it &#8211; which results in performance issues like stuttering and tearing, as well as a drastic reduction in battery life. Well, that&#8217;s changed now. Thanks to the work of, well, many, a major commit has added hardware accelerated video decoding/encoding to OpenBSD. Hardware accelerated video decode/encode (VA-API) support is beginning to land in #OpenBSD -current. libva has been integrated into xenocara with the Intel userland drivers in the ports tree. AMD requires Mesa support, hence the inclusion in base. A number of ports will be adjusted to enable VA-API support over time, as they are tested. ↫ Bryan Steele This is great news, and a major improvement for OpenBSD and the community. Apparently, performance in Firefox is excellent, and with simply watching video on YouTube being something a lot of people do with their computers &#8211; especially laptops &#8211; anyone using OpenBSD is going to benefit immensely from this work.

## 1989 networking: NetWare 386

date: 2024-07-21, from: OS News

NetWare 386 or 3.0 was a very limited release, with very few copies sold before it was superseded by newer versions. As such, it was considered lost to time, since it was only sold to large corporations &#8211; for a massive almost 8000 dollar price tag &#8211; who obviously didn&#8217;t care about software preservation. There are no original disks left, but a recent &#8220;warez&#8221; release has made the software available once again. As always, pirates save the day.

<p>Pretty sure most people don't get that being president is a job, not a role someone plays in a TV sitcom. </p>
<p>Great wealth is poison, that's what's playing out in the NYT-orchestrated overthrow of the American government. They're driving us into the arms of the Nazis. Who knows why, or even if there is a reason, other than their drive to find meaning in their great wealth. Their problem, and ours, is that it has no meaning, no human can use the money they've accumulated. These are not human-size fortunes, playing a game of make-believe, what if we really were as smart as we think our money says we are. Well you ain't that smart.</p>

<a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/bidens-exit-puts-the-spotlight-on-the-dnc-delegates">The earth shook today</a>. I'm watching the news like everyone else after President Biden withdrew. There really is a lot happening very quickly, and the Dems all sound like they got their story straight, for once the Dems sound like a party. How did that happen. NakedJen says we need a miracle. I said that's her department. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">❤️</span>

## NYT just stop podcast

date: 2024-07-21, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/07/04/butHerEmails.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">A two-minute <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/21/nytSayYourSorryAndGetBackToNews.m4a">podcast</a> where I dictate an op-ed the NYT should run in its own name, apologizing for trying to take over the US government, and promising to return to being a news organization. </p>
<p>I am so fed up with it. Today they ran an op-ed written by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Sorkin">Aaron Sorkin</a> giving advice to Democrats based on his experience writing scripts for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_West_Wing">fictional White House</a> <i>television show</i> in the late 90s and early 00s. </p>
<p>Yeah the NYT has lost its way. I hope some people down there think they're way out on a limb and it's time to get back to what they do. They are not qualified or entitled to do what they are doing.</p>

## Managing Classic Mac OS resources in ResEdit

date: 2024-07-21, from: OS News

The Macintosh was intended to be different in many ways. One of them was its file system, which was designed for each file to consist of two forks, one a regular data fork as in normal file systems, the other a structured database of resources, the resource fork. Resources came to be used to store a lot of standard structured data, such as the specifications for and contents of alerts and dialogs, menus, collections of text strings, keyboard definitions and layouts, icons, windows, fonts, and chunks of code to be used by apps. You could extend the types of resource supported by means of a template, itself stored as a resource, so developers could define new resource types appropriate to their own apps. ↫ Howard Oakley And using ResEdit, a tool developed by Apple, you could manipulate the various resources to your heart&#8217;s content. I never used the classic Mac OS when it was current, and only play with it as a retro platform every now and then, so I ever used ResEdit when it was the cool thing to do. Looking back, though, and learning more about it, it seems like just another awesome capability that Apple lost along the way towards modern Apple. Perhaps I should load up on my old Macs and see with my own eyes what I can do with ResEdit.

## Thoughts on digital communities

date: 2024-07-21, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>I had some interesting exchanges recently with <a href="https://kevquirk.com">Kev</a>, <a href="http://ruk.ca">Peter</a>, and <a href="https://renecoignard.com">René</a>, all touching on the topic of communities, both on and offline. Communities, especially here in the digital space, are something I’m very interested in. It’s something I find myself thinking about often and I constantly have ideas for things I should try. But let me ask you a more fundamental question: what even is a community? Always useful to grab a definition as a starting point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A community is a social unit (a group of living things) with a shared socially significant characteristic, such as place, set of norms, culture, religion, values, customs, or identity. Communities may share a sense of place situated in a given geographical area (e.g. a country, village, town, or neighborhood) or in virtual space through communication platforms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this is a good definition. We begin by making it clear that we need <em>“living things”</em> to have a community and considering the weird AI phase we’re going through that’s probably worth stating. So bots are out, humans are in.</p>
<p>We then move on to what makes a community a community: the sharing of some <em>“socially significant characteristic”</em>. In the context of online communities, I like to refer to that as the <em>“what are we here for”</em> characteristic. At a fundamental level, members of a community have to share the same motivations to be there in the first place. If those motivations start to diverge then things quickly fall apart.</p>
<p>It’s like politics. You can have different ideas on how things should be done—and we can debate those forever—but we have to agree that, at a fundamental level, we do want to move in the same general direction: make the place better. The devil’s in the details and we can discuss what better means but there has to be at least some common ground in the overall direction. Without that, things will fall apart. And things might fall apart even with a common ground!</p>
<p>Back to online communities. I have my place here on the web. I’m happy with my site, I’m happy with my projects. But I keep thinking that maybe there’s something else that can be done, that I should be doing. I keep bouncing around various digital places—mostly forums—and I have yet to find one that truly feels like the place where I want to be. Some move too fast, some don’t move at all. Some are narrowly focused on one thing, others are not focused at all and it’s pure chaos. And I don’t blame those places or the people who tried to create them. Creating a community is hard. Figuring out the right mixture of people is complicated. Figuring out the right amount of people is complicated. Group dynamics are never easy to navigate.</p>
<p>I’d love to know what you think about all this. Are there online places where you feel at home? Is there something you’re missing? Do you even care about all this? <a href="mailto:hello@manuelmoreale.com">Let me know</a>!</p>                <hr>

## Google URL Shortener links will no longer be available

date: 2024-07-21, from: OS News

In 2018, we announced the deprecation and transition of Google URL Shortener because of the changes we’ve seen in how people find content on the internet, and the number of new popular URL shortening services that emerged in that time. This meant that we no longer accepted new URLs to shorten but that we would continue serving existing URLs. Today, the time has come to turn off the serving portion of Google URL Shortener. Please read on below to understand more about how this will impact you if you’re using Google URL Shortener. ↫ Sumit Chandel and Eldhose Mathokkil Babu It should cost Google nothing to keep this running for as long as Google exists, and yet, this, too, has to be killed off and buried in the Google Graveyard. We&#8217;ll be running into non-resolving Google URL Shortener links for decades to come, both on large, popular websites a well as on obscure forums and small websites. You&#8217;ll find a solution to some obscure problem a decade from now, but the links you need will be useless, and you&#8217;ll rightfully curse Google for being so utterly petty. Relying on anything Google that isn&#8217;t directly serving its main business &#8211; ads &#8211; is a recipe for disaster, and will cause headaches down the line. Things like Gmail, YouTube, and Android are most likely fine, but anything consumer-focused is really a lottery.

## Why ChatGPT is simply better

date: 2024-07-21, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>One great use for ChatGPT, simple recipes.</p>
<p>If you try looking for a recipe on Google they take forever to get to the point, and pop up all kinds of offers when all you wanted was a checklist of ingredients and steps. </p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/c9b39a6b-ad4b-4931-9f7e-93c6c7685c03">how to make hard-boiled eggs</a>.</p>
<p>Try doing the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+make+hard+boiled+eggs">same thing</a> on Google to see what I mean.</p>
