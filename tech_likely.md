NASA is working to resume science operations of the agency’s Hubble Space Telescope after it entered safe mode April 23 due to an ongoing gyroscope (gyro) issue. Hubble’s instruments are stable, and the telescope is in good health. The telescope automatically entered safe mode when one of its three gyroscopes gave faulty readings. The gyros […]

## Live together in perfect harmony…

date: 2024-04-26, from: Status-Q blog

I&#8217;m fond of both milk and dark chocolate. Milk chocolate is yummy kiddy comfort food. Dark chocolate is more sophisticated, more bitter, more &#8216;adult&#8217;. It&#8217;s also less likely to melt at inconvenient times, so helping you preserve that more sophisticated appearance. But the problem, I find, is that dark chocolate often has too little taste. <a class="more-link excerpt-link" href="https://statusq.org/archives/2024/04/26/12039/">Continue Reading<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right"></span></a>

## P&B: Veronique

date: 2024-04-26, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>This is the 35th edition of <em>People and Blogs</em>, the series where I ask interesting people to talk about themselves and their blogs. Today we have Veronique and her blog, <a href="https://veronique.ink">veronique.ink</a></p>
<p>To follow this series <a href="https://peopleandblogs.com">subscribe to the newsletter</a>. A new interview will land in your inbox every Friday. Not a fan of newsletters? No problem! You can read the interviews here on the blog or you can subscribe to the <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/feed">RSS feed</a>.</p>
<p>If you're enjoying the People and Blogs series and you want to see it grow, consider supporting on <a href="https://ko-fi.com/manuelmoreale">Ko-Fi</a>.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Let's start from the basics: can you introduce yourself?</h2>
<p>Hi, my name is Veronique, and I’m an artist, writer, and zine maker. I live in Toronto with my dog, Muskoka. I love making zines and championing small-press indie writers. I enjoy discovering new artists, going for trail hikes with my doggo, making art while listening to tunes, daydreaming, exchanging emails as personal letters, and discovering new personal blogs. Lately, I’ve been teaching myself how to play my late father’s guitar.</p>
<h2>What’s the story behind your blog?</h2>
<p>I started my blog in August 2022, after stumbling upon a few personal sites. I became enchanted by these quiet spaces away from social media. One blog in particular, <em>TMO</em> (no longer active), inspired me to start writing. His vulnerable, daily slice-of-life posts immediately catapulted me into wanting to document my life through blogging. </p>
<p>My search for a simple writing platform took some time, but eventually, I came across <a href="https://bearblog.dev"><em>Bearblog</em></a>, which won me over with its simplicity. I’m not tech-savvy, so the fewer bells and whistles a platform has, the more I can concentrate on what matters—writing. </p>
<p>My dad fell ill in the fall of 2022, and writing on my blog became a lifeline. Writing online created a cocooned arena for exploring my wayward thoughts and feelings and forged an invisible string, tying me to far-flung strangers across the web. Blogging felt like a refuge and reminded me that we’re all sharing this bumpy, precarious timeline together.</p>
<p>I read once that you should write your obsessions. Not only for yourself but also to find your <em>kind</em>. Being an introvert, this sentiment really resonated with me. Connecting through personal blogs can sometimes feel deeper than in-person interactions. Since writing on my blog, I’ve met the most wonderful internet denizens who have morphed into veritable email comrades—and I love it. </p>
<h2>What does your creative process look like when it comes to blogging?</h2>
<p>My posts are primarily short-form and meant to be a catch-all container for ideas and preserving fragments of ordinary moments. I prefer to write in spontaneous, off-the-cuff spurts. Thoughts, ideas, and links to things I want to share are written in my phone notes app or the myriad unfinished journals around my apartment. </p>
<p>I’ve been fond of writing posts in bullet form lately. It's a quick way to record passing thoughts and share pictures, ideas, and quotes I like. I feel like personal blogs are in constant flux and unpolished by nature, which appeals to me. </p>
<h2>Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also, do you believe the physical space influences your creativity?</h2>
<p>I like to write first thing in the morning before I'm swayed emotionally by other people's output.</p>
<p>I’ve romanticized having an old wooden "writers’ desk" in the corner of my living room, but I have a sneaking suspicion I’d still end up on the couch, scrunched up with horrible posture with my laptop over my legs. </p>
<p>I like to blog on my phone when I'm out and about—busy pubs, cafes, or on the bus. Plunking myself in new places sharpens my observational rolodex and removes me from my regular inner dialogue. </p>
<h2>A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your tech stack?</h2>
<p>My setup is minimal. I write on my MacBook Air M2 laptop and iPhone 15 Pro phone. Bearblog hosts my blog, and my domain name is registered with GoDaddy. C'est tout!</p>
<h2>Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would you do anything differently?</h2>
<p>I haven’t been blogging long, but I wish I was more versed in HTML and CSS. I’ve spent countless hours combing the net for tips on how best to tinker with my site. I enjoy it, though, as it feels like solving a mini-puzzle.</p>
<p>The other thing would be allowing people to subscribe to my blog with their email. I need to remedy that asap. </p>
<h2>Financial question since the web is obsessed with money: how much does it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost or does it generate some revenue? And what's your position on people monetizing personal blogs?</h2>
<p>For now, Bearblog is $20 a year, and it costs me about $35 to renew my domain. </p>
<p>Monetizing a blog feels like a touchy subject, and a lot of people are put off by paying someone for online writing. Newsletter fatigue is real, and being hit with member fees in every nook and cranny on the net is rampant. </p>
<p>But from a creative perspective, people still have to pay rent, and people still need to eat. </p>
<p>Artists, writers, and makers should and <em>can</em> make a living doing what they love. </p>
<p>I’m a huge proponent of supporting artists for their work. I allocate about $20 a month to support my favorites through platforms like Patreon, BMAC, Ko-Fi, independent newsletters, and one-off coffees. </p>
<p>I'd love to make a living from writing on my blog. Is this realistic, especially without ads, trackers, sponsored posts, or paywalls? I don’t know, but I spend a lot of time thinking about how to make it work. I keep trying different things and am not afraid to pivot if something isn’t working. It's tough, but it's something I love working towards. </p>
<p>The idea of making money from my writing still feels uncomfortable sometimes. There’s a touch of imposter syndrome, low self-esteem, and not feeling in league with the high-caliber writers of Substack, etc, but I keep pushing through. However, money aside, writing and sharing things on my blog is something I deeply cherish and will continue doing regardless of monetary gain. </p>
<h2>Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth checking out? And also, who do you think I should be interviewing next?</h2>
<p>There are so many blog gems I love! Here's a few favs: </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://anhvn.com/">Anh's</a> website is so fun and whimsical. I’m in awe of her site’s aesthetic and how she incorporates her illustrations to further express herself.</li>
<li><a href="https://lili.bearblog.dev">Lili's Musings</a>. Uncut, thought-provoking writing. Themes include diary-like entries, thoughts on academia, unraveling the writing process, trans struggles, and processing anxieties. </li>
<li><a href="https://dahlstrand.net/2024/03/14/this-is-a.html">Sven Dahlstrand</a>. A cool human being with a really fun blog who's always linking to interesting things. </li>
<li><a href="https://rusi.me">Growing Old With You</a>. Ru’s blog is a tapestry of poignant writing and laid-bare slices of life, and I admire her vulnerability on the page.</li>
<li><a href="https://thewallflowerdigest.co.uk">The Wallflower Digest</a> Alice’s blog is new to me, and I’m having so much fun devouring her writing. She’s a book-loving introvert who grapples with social anxiety (like me!), and her writing topics and hobbies are wide and varied. </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Lili</em> and <em>Anh</em> would both be great guests for your next interview!</p>
<h2>Final question: is there anything you want to share with us?</h2>
<p>Read more poetry and zines! </p>
<ul>
<li>New to zines? Let Bre from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@brattyxbre">brattyxbre</a> and Wesley from <a href="https://youtube.com/@TwentyTwoZines">Twenty-Two Zines</a> guide you. </li>

## Corporate greed from Apple and Google have destroyed the passkey future

date: 2024-04-26, from: OS News

William Brown, developer of webauthn-rs, has written a scathing blog post detailing how corporate interests &#8211; namely, Apple and Google &#8211; have completely and utterly destroyed the concept of passkeys. The basic gist is that Apple and Google were more interested in control and locking in users than in providing a user-friendly passwordless future, and in doing so have made passkeys effectively a worse user experience than just using passwords in a password manager. Since then Passkeys are now seen as a way to capture users and audiences into a platform. What better way to encourage long term entrapment of users then by locking all their credentials into your platform, and even better, credentials that can&#8217;t be extracted or exported in any capacity. Both Chrome and Safari will try to force you into using either hybrid (caBLE) where you scan a QR code with your phone to authenticate &#8211; you have to click through menus to use a security key. caBLE is not even a good experience, taking more than 60 seconds work in most cases. The UI is beyond obnoxious at this point. Sometimes I think the password game has a better ux. The more egregious offender is Android, which won&#8217;t even activate your security key if the website sends the set of options that are needed for Passkeys. This means the IDP gets to choose what device you enroll without your input. And of course, all the developer examples only show you the options to activate &#8220;Google Passkeys stored in Google Password Manager&#8221;. After all, why would you want to use anything else? ↫ William Brown The whole post is a sobering read of how a dream of passwordless, and even usernameless, authentication was right within our grasp, usable by everyone, until Apple and Google got involved and enshittified the standards and tools to promote lock-in and their own interests above the user experience. If even someone as knowledgeable about this subject as Brown, who writes actual software to make these things work, is advising against using passkeys, you know something&#8217;s gone horribly wrong. I also looked into possibly using passkeys, including using things like a Yubikey, but the process seems so complex and unpleasant that I, too, concluded just sticking to Bitwarden and my favourite open source TFA application was a far superior user experience.

## Gentoo bans use of “AI” tools

date: 2024-04-26, from: OS News

Gentoo, the venerable Linux distribution which in my headcanon I describe as &#8216;classy&#8217;, has banned any use of &#8220;AI&#8221;. A proposal by Gentoo Council member Michał Górny from February of this year banning its use has been unanimously accepted by the Gentoo Council. The new policy reads: It is expressly forbidden to contribute to Gentoo any content that has been created with the assistance of Natural Language Processing artificial intelligence tools. This motion can be revisited, should a case been made over such a tool that does not pose copyright, ethical and quality concerns. ↫ Michał Górny We&#8217;ll have to see how this policy will be implemented, but I like that Gentoo is willing to take a stand.

The supported versions will be the last minor, plus the previous minor, which will be
supported for three months once the new minor is out.
This is in effect adding two more months of support to the outgoing minor over
what we used to have.</p>
<h2>What's New in 1.23</h2>
<h3>PostgreSQL Image Catalogs</h3>
<p>Say goodbye to PostgreSQL version management headaches! With image catalogs
based on major versions, managing your database fleet has never been easier.
Simply request the PostgreSQL major version you need and control how your
databases stay up-to-date. We've introduced two new resources
(<code>ClusterImageCatalog</code> and <code>ImageCatalog</code>) and a new stanza
(<code>spec.imageCatalogRef</code>), setting the stage for simpler management of default images.
The Community will provide catalogs, and you could also use third-party ones,
or even build your own.</p>
<h3>Synchronization of User-Defined Replication Slots</h3>
<p>Ensure seamless failover with extended physical replication slot
synchronization, now covering persistence of user-defined slots after failover.</p>
<h3>Pod Disruption Budget (PDB) Configuration</h3>
<p>Customize PDB settings with the new <code>.spec.enablePDB</code> field. Disable PDBs
on primary instances for single-instance deployments, ensuring smooth pod
eviction during maintenance operations. This marks our first step towards
deprecating the node maintenance window feature.</p>
<h2>Upgrade and Maintenance</h2>
<p>Before upgrading, carefully review the
<a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/current/installation_upgrade/#upgrading-to-1230-1223-or-1215">detailed instructions</a>.

1.22.3 and 1.21.5.</p>
<p>We recommend upgrading to CloudNativePG 1.23.0 at your earliest convenience.
Alternatively, update to the latest patch version within your current minor
release.</p>
<h2>End of Life Announcement</h2>
<p>With the release of 1.23.0, the 1.21.x minor version will reach its <a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.23/supported_releases/#support-status-of-cloudnativepg-releases">end of
life</a>

## This year's call for expressions of interest to join our board

date: 2024-04-26, from: Crossref Blog

<p>The Crossref Nominating Committee is inviting expressions of interest to join the Board of Directors of Crossref for the term starting in January 2025. The committee will gather responses from those interested and create the slate of candidates that our membership will vote on in an election in September.</p>
<p><strong>Expressions of interest will be due Monday, May 27th, 2024</strong></p>
<p>This is an exciting time to join the board, as we have a number of active projects underway: We are considering resourcing Crossref for a sustainable future and board members will be part of deciding any changes to our fees scheme and overseeing its implementation. We&rsquo;re focusing on how our community and metadata can contribute to ensuring the integrity of the scholarly record. We’re broadening our metadata record to capture richer funding and institutional affiliations. We&rsquo;re working towards a future where the scholarly record prioritizes relationships between research outputs to build a holistic research nexus. The board helps guide this work.</p>
<h3 id="about-the-board-elections">About the board elections</h3>
<p>The board is elected through the “one member, one vote” policy wherein every member organization of Crossref has a single vote to elect representatives to the Crossref board. Board terms are for three years, and this year, there are four seats open for election.</p>
<p>The board maintains a balance of seats, with eight seats for smaller members and eight seats for larger members (based on total revenue to Crossref). This is an effort to ensure that the scholarly community&rsquo;s diversity of experiences and perspectives is represented in decisions made at Crossref.</p>
<p>This year, we will elect two of the larger member seats (membership tiers $3,900 and above) and two of the smaller member seats (membership tiers $1,650 and below). You don’t need to specify which seat you are applying for; we will provide that information to the nominating committee.</p>
<p>The online election will open in September, with results announced at the annual meeting on October 29th, 2024. New members will begin their term in January 2025.</p>
<h3 id="about-the-nominating-committee">About the Nominating Committee</h3>
<p>The Nominating Committee reviews the expressions of interest and selects a slate of candidates for election. The slate put forward will exceed the total number of open seats. The committee considers the statements of interest, organizational size, geography, and experience.</p>
<p>2024 Nominating Committee</p>
<ul>
<li>James Phillpotts*, Director of Content Transformation and Standards, Oxford University Press, committee chair</li>
<li>Oscar Donde*, Editor in Chief, Pan Africa Science Journal</li>
<li>Rose L’Huillier*, Senior Vice President Researcher Products, Elsevier</li>

</ul>
<p>(*) indicates Crossref board member</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-committee-looking-for-this-year">What is the committee looking for this year</h3>
<p>The committee looks for skills and experience that will complement the rest of the board. Candidates from countries and regions not currently reflected on the board are strongly encouraged to apply. Successful candidates often have some or all of these characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Demonstrate a commitment to or understanding of our <a href="https://www.crossref.org/strategy/" target="_blank">strategic agenda</a> or the <a href="https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/" target="_blank">Principles of Open Scholarly Infrastructure</a>;</li>
<li>Have expertise that may be underrepresented on the board currently;</li>
<li>Hold senior/director-level positions in their organizations;</li>
<li>Have experience with governance or community involvement;</li>
<li>Represent member organizations that are active in the scholarly communications ecosystem;</li>
<li>Demonstrate metadata best practices as shown in the member’s <a href="https://www.crossref.org/members/prep/" target="_blank">participation report</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The board is also encouraging Crossref members who are research funders to apply.</p>
<h3 id="board-roles-and-responsibilities">Board roles and responsibilities</h3>
<p>Crossref’s services provide a central infrastructure for scholarly communications. Crossref’s board helps shape the future of our services and by extension, impacts the broader scholarly ecosystem. We are looking for board members to contribute their experience and perspective.</p>
<p>The role of the board at Crossref is to provide strategic and financial oversight of the organization, as well as guidance to the Executive Director and the staff leadership team, with the key responsibilities being:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting the strategic direction for the organization;</li>
<li>Providing financial oversight; and</li>
<li>Approving new policies and services.</li>
</ul>
<p>The board is representative of our membership base and guides the staff leadership team on trends affecting scholarly communications. The board sets strategic directions for the organization while also providing oversight into policy changes and implementation. Board members have a fiduciary responsibility to ensure sound operations. They do this by attending board meetings as well as joining more specific board committees.</p>
<h3 id="who-can-apply-to-join-the-board">Who can apply to join the board?</h3>
<p>Any active member of Crossref can apply to join the board. Crossref membership is open to organizations that produce content, such as academic presses, commercial publishers, standards organizations, and research funders.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-expected-of-board-members">What is expected of board members?</h3>
<p>Board members attend four meetings each year that typically take place in January, March, July, and November. Meetings have taken place in a variety of international locations and travel support is provided when needed. January, March, and November board meetings are held virtually, and all committee meetings take place virtually. Each board member should sit on at least one Crossref committee. Care is taken to accommodate the wide range of time zones in which our board members live.</p>
<p>While the expressions of interest are specific to an individual, the seat that is elected to the board belongs to the member organization. The primary board member also names an alternate who may attend meetings in the event that the primary board member is unable to. There is no personal financial obligation to sit on the board. The member organization must remain in good standing.</p>
<p>Board members are expected to be comfortable assuming the responsibilities listed above and to prepare and participate in board meeting discussions.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-apply">How to apply</h3>
<p>Please <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf5m9mXCYRGQgu_6qlo7xaIz0LyFgmzIXTeOC-UW8_2C20pmw/viewform" target="_blank">click here to submit your expression of interest</a>. We ask for a brief statement about how your organization could enhance the our board and a brief personal statement about your interest and experience with Crossref.</p>

## Ideas for my dream CMS

date: 2024-04-25, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>Matt Haughey wrote <a href="https://a.wholelottanothing.org/a-blueprint-of-my-dream-blogging-cms/">a blueprint for his “Dream CMS”</a> and <a href="https://shoptalkshow.com/612/">we had him on ShopTalk</a> to talk about it. That got me thinking about what features I’d want in <em>my</em> dream CMS. It’s fun to think of what a modern CMS might have like inline editing, asset serving, monetization/membership functionality, and more imaginative comment moderation.</p>
<p>Most of my dream CMS features center around improving my writing and content surfacing. All these ideas seem like a pretty good fit for LLMs or AI, even though I don’t drink from that particular well often.</p>
<h2>1. On-the-fly fact-checking</h2>
<p>As <a href="https://daverupert.com/2024/03/lies-damned-lies-and-stochastics/">I think more about verifying outputs</a>, I’d love a feedback tool that did a quick fact check before I hit publish. Did I not cite a source? Did I make a false assertion that ruins the credibility of the whole post? Did I not consider some perspective I should have? Am I just bitching and moaning? CMS, help me, please! I’m making an idiot out of myself.</p>
<h2>2. Auto-tagging</h2>
<p>I write a lot of posts but I’m shit at tagging them. I wish I could tell my CMS “Hey, here’s a general list of topics I write about, please recommend tags before I hit publish.” Then I think it’d be cool if the little robot butler could crawl old posts suggest tags for those or find themes emanating from my subconscious that I hadn’t picked up on.</p>
<aside>
<p>Sideblog: IMHO, tag templates are an underserved part of web design and it’s my goal to give all my tag pages the full blow-out treatment like I started to do with my <a href="https://daverupert.com/tag/vibecheck">vibechecks</a>.</p>
</aside>
<h2>3. Topic bundling</h2>
<p>À la auto-tagging, it would be neat if a CMS observed my content at a high-level and suggested opportunities to bundle posts of a similar theme into an online “zine” to offer new topic-based entry points for new readers. My lists of reverse chronological posts are thematically scattershot and I think some readers might find this more useful.</p>
<p>This idea gets into listicle territory pretty quick, but I often pull on thought threads over the course of months or years but that is entirely unsurfaced on my blog. I’d also love it if the machine could bundle links I share on my Mastodon feed to pull in other perspectives as well.</p>
<h2>4. Idea validation</h2>
<p>I’d love to know what content is outperforming other content. I’m sure I could piece this together myself with a half-dozen spreadsheets from Google Analytics, but I’d love to log into my CMS and know “Your CSS posts tend to have 10x engagement over your longform thoughtvomit” or “Your shitposts are driving traffic but are negatively impacting the quality of your site”. I don’t play the engagement game much but I’d love some data-driven validation nudging me in a positive direction when I’m discouraged, perhaps it could even suggest a handful of topics.</p>
<p>There’s a gross content farm machine version of this idea that identifies popular topics, suggests titles, an LLM writes posts based on those titles, and Dall-E plops an unsplashy image at the top… but that gives me the ick. At that point, you’re not blogging your thoughts or offering anyone any human value, you’re just clicking ✨ Sparkle Buttons.</p>
<hr />
<p>For what it’s worth, baking these features into a CMS has little material benefit for me. This site is statically generated from markdown so it’s practically the opposite of a full-featured CMS. Or… perhaps it’s the perfect situation to start exploring some of these ideas.</p>

## Ubuntu 24.04 LTS released

date: 2024-04-25, from: OS News

It wasn&#8217;t too long ago that new Ubuntu releases were major happenings in the Linux world, as it was the default Linux distribution for many, both old and newcomers, in the desktop Linux space. These days, Ubuntu release hit a little different, with Canonical&#8217;s focus having shifted much more to the enterprise, and several aspects of the distribution being decidedly unpopular, like the snap package management system. Still, Ubuntu is probably still one of the most popular, if not the most popular, distributions out there, so any new release, like today&#8217;s Ubuntu 24.0 LTS, is still a big deal. Ubuntu Desktop brings the Subiquity installer to an LTS for the first time. In addition to a refreshed user experience and a minimal install by default, the installer now includes experimental support for ZFS and TPM-based full disk encryption and the ability to import auto-install configurations. Post install, users will be greeted with the latest GNOME 46 alongside a new App Center and firmware-updater. Netplan is now the default for networking configuration and supports bidirectionality with NetworkManager. ↫ Utkarsh Gupta on ubuntu-announce Of course, all the various other Ubuntu editions have also seen new releases: Edubuntu, Kubuntu, Lubuntu, Ubuntu Budgie, Ubuntu Cinnamon, Ubuntu Kylin, Ubuntu MATE, Ubuntu Studio, Ubuntu Unity, and Xubuntu. Yes, that&#8217;s a long list. They all mostly share the same improvements as Ubuntu&#8217;s main course, but paired with the latest versions of the respective desktop environments instead. Except for Kubuntu. Unlike just about any other major distribution released over the last few months, such as Fedora 40 only a few days ago, Kubuntu does not ship with the new KDE Plasma 6, opting for Plasma 5.27.11 instead. There simply wasn&#8217;t enough time between the release of Plasma 6 and the Ubuntu feature freeze, so they made the &#8211; in my opinion &#8211; understandable call to stick to Plasma 5 for now, moving Plasma 6 to the next release later this year.

## Corporate Open Source is Dead

## Too little, and too much, self-promotion

date: 2024-04-25, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>Self-promotion is a weird subject. It’s one of those things that is strictly tied to who you are as a person. I am, broadly speaking, a shy and reserved person. I don’t like to be in the spotlight, I don’t like to draw attention to myself. I also really care about other people's space and time, which is why I’ve always been incredibly conservative when it comes to promoting things I do online.</p>
<p>Every time I need to do something that is marketing-related, I can feel the tension in my brain as if a part of me is trying to fight against it. And this is for the most benign things. I’ll give you an example. I recently edited all P&amp;B interviews and added a line at the end of the intro that reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you're enjoying the People and Blogs series and you want to see it grow, consider supporting on Ko-Fi.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A line of text and a link. The reason why I did that is because the only place where Ko-Fi was mentioned was way at the of each interview and I thought that most people probably stop reading when they reach the end of the interview. And so I added that single line. But adding that single line was a struggle. Because in my head, it’s obvious that if you do enjoy something and are willing to support it, you’d probably go look for a way to do it. That’s how my brain works. But unfortunately, that’s not how the internet works. Apparently, the correct approach seems to be the opposite one. You have to constantly remind people to like and subscribe, to support, to contribute, and to share.</p>
<p>How much self-promotion is too much? Substack interrupting your reading experience to remind you to subscribe feels too much to me. An overlay interrupting your browsing to ask you to subscribe to a newsletter is also too much. Am I wrong? Am I crazy in thinking it’s too much?</p>
<p>Also, is promoting something I’m doing any different than advertising? I know it’s conceptually not the same thing but for you, on the other side of this, is it any different? So many questions. It’s goddamn hard to do “marketing” with integrity.</p>                <hr>

## Llamafile’s progress, four months in

date: 2024-04-25, from: Mozilla Developer Network blog

<p>When Mozilla’s Innovation group first launched the llamafile project late last year, we were thrilled by the immediate positive response from open source AI developers. It’s become one of Mozilla’s top three most-favorited repositories on GitHub, attracting a number of contributors, some excellent PRs, and a growing community on our Discord server.</p>

Do you remember when you first realized that people weren't talking to you in a response to your post, they were talking over your shoulder to the people who read your post. I guess it depends on who you are, but I don't see any value in providing a surface for spam. These days I block people without much thought if I think that's what they're doing. So, why should you design a protocol, and pay the cost of supporting, something that is a vector for spam and abuse? That's the argument in favor of using <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> to glue things together. You can comment on my post, in your space, but my followers don't have to see it. That's up to me. I think it would change the nature of discourse, for the better.

<p>One of today's highlights is the installation InStability, an interactive exhibit by two close friends ( <span class="h-card" translate="no"><a href="https://mas.to/@karafuto" class="u-url mention" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">@<span>karafuto</span></a></span> ) that explores seizmic activity in the Reykjanes peninsula (Reykjavík-ish). Using capacitive textiles and pressure sensitive layers the exhibit lets visitors touch the land and create earthquakes at their fingertips. The many seizmic sensors across the land light up as the waves propagate. A deep soundscape (hard to video) permeates the entire venue (a small concert hall) as the quakes strike. </p><p>I was lucky enough to help a tiny bit in the production of the textiles a few evenings. They did such an amazing job.

## The only viable Android and iOS competitor intends to leave China and go global

date: 2024-04-25, from: OS News

Huawei plans to expand its native HarmonyOS smartphone platform worldwide, despite coming under US-led sanctions that have deprived it of access to key technologies. The Chinese tech megacorp released its own phone platform in 2019, the same year that US sanctions blocked Huawei from having further access to Google&#8217;s Android software to power its devices. More recently, the company saw its Mate 60 Pro smartphone become the top selling device in China&#8217;s huge consumer market, displacing rivals such as Apple&#8217;s iPhone. It also has a newer device, the Pura 70, that could pose a bigger threat to Apple sales in the country. ↫ Dan Robinson at The Register If there is one company that has the capabilities and will to truly offer a third alternative, it&#8217;s Huawei with HarmonyOS. This company has the full might of the Chinese state behind it, and it clearly has the drive to prove itself after the various sanctions levied against it in recent years that barred it from using Google&#8217;s Android. It&#8217;s obviously already experiencing major success in its home market, but now the company intends to go global, country by country, to positino HarmonyOS alongside iOS and Android. Huawei basically takes a brute-force approach, explaining that they identify the 5000 most popular applications, which they claim cover 99% of users&#8217; time with their smartphones, and port those over first. I&#8217;m not entirely sure how they convince developers to port over their applications, but I&#8217;m guessing money is involved. Fair play, I would say &#8211; it&#8217;s not like anything else is going to break the stranglehold Apple and Google have over the mobile application market. We haven&#8217;t really spent much time talking about HarmonyOS in the west in general, and on OSNews in particular, which is a bit of a shame because it has some interesting characteristics. For instance, it has a multi-kernel design, where it uses the Linux kernel on more powerful devices like smartphones and tablets, and the RTOS LiteOS kernel on lower power IoT devices. DSoftBus is another interesting part of the operating system, which allows multiple devices to kind of join together and share data, applications, and control seamlessly. HarmonyOS supports both Android and true HarmonyOS applications, the latter of which are marked with a little logo in the corner of the application icon, but the unique features of HarmonyOS, like DSoftBus, are only accessible to true HarmonyOS applications. Developing these native applications can be done in DevEco Studio, which is built atop IntelliJ IDEA, using ArkUI. Huawei even went so far as to develop its own browser engine for HarmonyOS, which it recently released as open source, called ArkWeb. While HarmonyOS currently still supports running Android applications, this will soon no longer be the case as the company is working on HarmonyOS NEXT, which will remove Android compatibility to focus entirely on true HarmonyOS applications instead. NEXT also does away entirely with the multikernel approach, ditching both the Linux and LiteOS kernels for a new HarmonyOS microkernel, and uses Huawei&#8217;s own Cangjie programming language for application development. HarmonyOS NEXT is currently being tested on a variety of Huawei devices, with a beta and final release planned for later this year. It&#8217;s just our luck that the only potentially viable competitor to Android and iOS is a party closed-source operating system from China, which will surely bring with it a whole host of security concerns in the west. It&#8217;s really difficult at the moment to ascertain just how much of HarmonyOS &#8211; and specifically, HarmonyOS NEXT &#8211; is available as open source, which is a major bummer. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d ever want to use a (partly) closed source Chinese operating system for anything major in my life, but if it&#8217;s open source we could at least see non-Chinese forks that I&#8217;d find easier to trust. The road of iOS and Android competitors is littered with the bodies of failed attempts &#8211; Symbian, the various iterations of Windows Phone, BlackBerry, Sailfish, Ubuntu Touch, the GNOME/Plasma attempts that just can&#8217;t grow beyond proof of concepts &#8211; and there is no way to know if Huawei can pull off outside of China what it did with HarmonyOS inside China. Western markets are incredibly weary of anything related to Huawei, and for all we know, this operating system won&#8217;t ever even be allowed inside the US and the EU in the first place. Regardless of international politics and the CCP&#8217;s brutal, totalitarian, genocidal regime, HarmonyOS NEXT seems like a very interesting platform with fresh ideas, and I&#8217;d love to at least try it out once it hits international markets with proper localisation into English. I&#8217;ll take a problematic Chinese smartphone operating system competitor over no competitor at all &#8211; even if I won&#8217;t use it myself, it&#8217;ll be at least some form of competition both Apple and Google desperately need.

## Palm OS and the devices that ran it

date: 2024-04-25, from: OS News

But just as smartphones would do, PDAs offered a dizzying array of operating systems and applications, and a great many of them ran Palm OS. (I bought my first Palm, an m505, new in 2001, upgrading from an HP 95LX.) Naturally, there’s no way we could enumerate every single such device in this article. So in this Ars retrospective, we’ll look back at some notable examples of the technical evolution of the Palm operating system and the devices that ran it—and how they paved the way for what we use now. ↫ Cameron Kaiser at Ars Technica This sure takes me back to my own in-depth Palm retrospective from &#8211; checks notes &#8211; 11 years ago (!). It turns out all the images from that article no longer load, so I should set aside some time to fix that up.

ChatGPT has memory across chats. This just <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/25/chatgptmessage.png">popped up</a> on the screen. I'd like to tell it that until further notice I use Node.js and do not use Express, and do use jQuery for my browser-based JavaScript, and I use the debugger all the time, so you can assume that. If this works, I now have a programming partner with memory. And maybe I can somehow get it to read all my blog posts going back 30 years? I have good archives of most of it. Also, of course I <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/25/chatgptcomments.png">fed this post</a> to ChatGPT of course. So ChatGPT is not resting on its laurels. That's good. I'd really like a <i>Personal ChatGPT, </i>and this is on the way to that goal.

## 2024-04-24 Micro-blogs

date: 2024-04-25, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-04-24-micro-blogs">2024-04-24 Micro-blogs</h1>

<p>Recently, I jokingly replied to <a class="account" href="https://merveilles.town/@jameschip" title="@jameschip@merveilles.town">@jameschip</a> when he said &ldquo;maybe we need a new word for types of blogs that have comments and federation&rdquo; that we should have kept the word micro-blogs. Regular blogs, with a character limit.</p>

<p>Then again, micro-blogs in that sense, from Identi.ca to GNU Social, Twitter, Facebook, Google+ and the Fediverse now have a big plus: Notification actually works. If you mention another account, they get notified. If you get a reply, you get notified. It&rsquo;s glorious.</p>

<p>For regular blogs, notification works with the oldest, universal, federated, communication medium online: email. Conversely, if you don&rsquo;t have email or don&rsquo;t do, you don&rsquo;t get notified and most likely you can&rsquo;t even comment. 😐</p>

<p>I tried web-mentions and they didn&rsquo;t work I wanted them to. Far too few other blogs supported them, and for this blog, I didn&rsquo;t know what to do with them. I didn&rsquo;t want to send myself email so I turned them into comments, but mentions aren&rsquo;t as strong a signal as a comment. Mentions aren&rsquo;t public but comments are. Mentions don&rsquo;t need a strong connection to the main article but comments do. By turning mentions into comments, I had made a mistake and the result was frustrating. So <a href="2023-09-20-web-mentions-vs-referrals">I got rid of them</a>.</p>

<p>And so here we are, it&rsquo;s 2024, and blogs still don&rsquo;t have good (spam-free) comments and notifications where as micro-blogs do. 😢</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Web">#Web</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Blogs">#Blogs</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Social_Media">#Social Media</a></p>

<p><strong>2024-04-24</strong>. I got an email from <a class="account" href="https://social.sdf.org/@reidrac" title="@reidrac@social.sdf.org">@reidrac</a> with a link to a related blog post, where he wrestles with webmentions:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This blog doesn’t have comments, although you can always send me an email if you want to comment anything, and some people have done that. Not often, but if I have received a handful of emails, that’s more comments that my old blog had in its last few years. – <a href="https://www.usebox.net/jjm/blog/connecting-blogs/">Connecting blogs</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>James also had this to say:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If your blog then has comments, and likes, and people on other platforms can comment, like, and share posts directly, is it really a blog any more? … Should blogs even have comments and notifications?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>I know that back when the Old School RPG blogosphere was strong, there were often questions that got tackled by multiple people. You&rsquo;d see a post about something interesting and post your own take and link back to the original. More people would jump onto the band-wagon, link to the four or five related blog posts they could find and add their take. It was cool! Those &ldquo;replies&rdquo; weren&rsquo;t just replies, they sometimes built on what had been said before, reformulated it, distilled it. It was great! The replies were also hard to find, unfortunately. People relied on the blogrolls of well-connected bloggers and blog aggregators like the <a href="https://campaignwiki.org/rpg">RPG Planet</a> I&rsquo;m running and similar sites like the RPGA, and forums like EN World, Dragonsfoot, ODD74, and so on.</p>

<p>I think we have to do the work and link to other people&rsquo;s blogs.</p>

## Google postpones phasing out third party cookies in Chrome once more

date: 2024-04-24, from: OS News

While Firefox and Safari phased out third party cookies years ago, it&#8217;s taking Chrome a bit longer because, well, daddy Google got ads to sell. As such, Google has been developing a complicated new alternative to third party cookies that it calls &#8220;Privacy sandbox&#8221;, a name in the vain of &#8220;Greenland&#8221;. This process has not exactly been going well, because Google has had to postpone phasing out third party cookies several times now, and today, they had to postpone it again. This time, however, it&#8217;s because the UK competition authority, the CMA, still has some questions. We recognize that there are ongoing challenges related to reconciling divergent feedback from the industry, regulators and developers, and will continue to engage closely with the entire ecosystem. It&#8217;s also critical that the CMA has sufficient time to review all evidence including results from industry tests, which the CMA has asked market participants to provide by the end of June. Given both of these significant considerations, we will not complete third-party cookie deprecation during the second half of Q4. We remain committed to engaging closely with the CMA and ICO and we hope to conclude that process this year. Assuming we can reach an agreement, we envision proceeding with third-party cookie deprecation starting early next year. ↫ Google&#8217;s Greenland blog Making a browser good enough to take over almost the entire browser market was an absolute master stroke by Google. Now can you all please switch over to Firefox or like Lynx or something?

## Snapdragon X Plus will bring ARM to ‘even more’ Windows laptops

date: 2024-04-24, from: OS News

While it’s still yet to debut, Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X Elite is looking like a big deal for ARM-powered Windows machines and, now, it’s getting a more affordable cousin in the Snapdragon X Plus. Announced today, Snapdragon X Plus is based on the same Oryon CPU as Snapdragon X Elite, just with a bit less power. The chip has 10 cores to the Elite’s 12, and is also clocked down from the Elite’s 3.8GHz to 3.4GHz. ↫ Ben Schoon at 9To5Google It really seems like it&#8217;s finally happening &#8211; ARM computers for the general public (that aren&#8217;t from Apple). I really hope that Qualcomm can deliver on its promises, and that Microsoft&#8217;s involvement means these computers will be fairly standardised so it&#8217;s easier for non-Windows platforms to support them. I&#8217;ve seen quite a few rumblings from people invited to Qualcomm&#8217;s press events for these new ARM chips that the company is delivering Linux support alongside Windows support, so that&#8217;s at least a good start. Whenever we talk about ARM coming to the generic PC market, people rightfully point out the lack of standardisation in the ARM space, so that really is the deciding factor here for people like us, who tend to not be all too interested in locked-down platforms. If every one of these machines is different enough that supporting them is a nightmare &#8211; like the world of smartphones &#8211; ARM for PCs will be dead on arrival for me because I have zero interest in buying Windows-only hardware. One thing Microsoft tends to be good at is getting at least some standardisation to stick in the PC market, and I hope they&#8217;re going to that here, too &#8211; Microsoft probably isn&#8217;t relishing supporting each individual ARM machine in Windows &#8216;by hand&#8217; either. Let&#8217;s keep our fingers crossed.

A bill that would force China-based company ByteDance to sell TikTok —&#160;or else face a US ban of the platform — is all but certain to become law after the Senate passed a foreign aid package including the measure. It now heads to President Joe Biden, who already committed to signing the TikTok legislation should it make it through both chambers of Congress. The House passed the foreign aid package that includes the TikTok bill on Saturday. ↫ Lauren Feiner at The Verge I hope the EU follows.

## Maldives 2024

date: 2024-04-24, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="maldives-2024">Maldives 2024</h1>

<p>The biosphere as we know it is ending and I’m spending two weeks in the Maldives with my wife for her 50th birthday. I feel conflicted.</p>

<p>The trip to get here was long. Zurich Doha by plane, Doha Male by plane, Male Kurudu by water-plane, Kurudu Komandoo by speedboat. I felt like sleeping for 20h when we finally got here. And all the <a href="2024-04-05-travel">anxiety before leaving</a> was terrible, too.</p>

<p>With that, I think we have all out must-see locations before the end. We went to the <a href="2017-10-28_Australia">Great Barrier Reef</a> in 2017, to the <a href="Galapagos_2020">Galapagos</a> in 2020 and now to the Maldives.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Pictures">#Pictures</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Maldives">#Maldives</a></p>

<p><strong>2024-04-06</strong>.
The last leg of the journey – our water-plane was delayed because of the bad weather.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Looking out from the porch the ocean is blue, the sky is blue and the reef begins a few meters in.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-5.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We go snorkeling every day. Our last two trips showed me that we need an underwater camera. Oh to have videos of Reef Number Nine in Australia or the penguins and sea lions in the Galapagos! I bought a GoPro Hero 10 before we left.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-2.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>This cowtail stingray (?) we keep seeing is about 2m long and likes to hide in the sand.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-3.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>There’s sea grass sprouting right now and sea turtles grazing.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-4.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Black tipped reef sharks… harmless! At a later point we did see it attack something hidden in the rocks and it was scary to see!</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-6.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Most corals look dreary! It’s certainly not as colourful and busy as in Australia or the Galapagos.
This purple giant is cool, though.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-7.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>There are still plenty of colourful fish.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Whenever we’re away on a trip, we play games.
The most popular tropical island game is Race for the Galaxy.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-9.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Yesterday we also played <a href="http://mixedsignals.ml/games/petition/">Petition</a> by <a class="account" href="https://mastodon.xyz/@klaatu" title="@klaatu@mastodon.xyz">@klaatu</a>.</p>

<p><strong>2024-04-10</strong>. More pictures.</p>

<p>We saw our first hermit crabs in Costa Rica where we spent our honey moon. We love these little ones. Maybe because they’re slow and easily scared and therefore obviously harmless.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-10.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The parrot fish have super sharp teeth and gnaw on the corals. And when you’re snorkeling, you can hear them. Kchrrr! Kchhhrrk!</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-11.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I also love those lone corals harbouring a small school of tiny fearful fish that retreat and hide in the coral as somebody approaches.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-12.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>When you swim past the nearby reef the bottom drops out and the deep blue begins. I am always afraid some huge fish will show up.</p>

</video>

<p>There is a strange tourism industry, here. The islands are either uninhabited, inhabited by locals, or reserved for tourism. Tourists can stay on the “local islands” since 2007. Natives are only allowed to work on the tourist islands.</p>

<p>The capital city is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_proper_by_population_density">one of the densest urban areas</a> on the planet. Just look at the image of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mal%C3%A9">Malé on Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<p>I would lament this urban sprawl, the land reclamation, the garbage problem, the democracy deficit, the dependence on tourism – but I know what my friend Peter would say, pointing at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factfulness">Factfulness</a> book. Check out these stats from the <a href="https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malediven">German Wikipedia page on the Maldives</a>:
In 2020, the Maldives had 541000 inhabitants.
In 1950, they had about 74000 inhabitants. At the time, a woman had about 7.5 children on average in 1980 but these days they are so much better off that the growth rate has dropped to 1.8% in 2020 and a woman has about 1.8 children on average. Life expectancy rose from 34.5 years in 1950 to 81 for women and 77.8 for men in 2020. An amazing improvement from the point of view of the locals.</p>

<p>From my green perspective, though… let’s not forget the garbage island <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thilafushi">Thilafushi</a>. The picked an island and use it as a garbage dump because they don&rsquo;t know what to do with all the garbage. Sure, every island needs a garbage incinerator now, but in the nineties, there was just garbage and it had to go somewhere. And some of the stuff starts leaking. It accumulates in the the fish. People eat the fish. It&rsquo;s easy to feel grim about this. I need to remind myself that life expectancy was less than 35 years just a generation or two ago (I was born in the seventies). Poverty is much, much worse than pollution and we tend to forget it.</p>

<p>If you’re wondering why I’m basically skimming, reading and finally summarizing Wikipedia articles on my blog, I guess the answer is that this is how I try to deal with it all. To not close my eyes. Not to look away.</p>

<p><strong>2024-04-12</strong>. Bad luck for Claudia. Yesterday, late at night, she stuck her small toe in a gap between two planks, took another step, nearly fell and twisted her foot. There’s a huge dark bruise on its back and a significant dark bruise below. No more fins, for a while. 😭</p>

<p>We had signed up for a snorkel safari when suddenly the buzz was that the young humpback whale they had seen two days ago was still around and so the ship picked up some extra passengers and Claudia came along to do some whale watching.</p>

<p>The whale watching did not disappoint.</p>

<video src="/wiki/2024-04-06-maledives-15.mov" poster="2024-04-06-maledives-15.jpg" width="1920" height="1080" controls muted>
<img alt="Image of a whale slapping its fin" src="2024-04-06-maledives-15.jpg"/><br>
<a alt="Video of the whale slapping its fin" href="/wiki/2024-04-06-maledives-15.mov">5 second video</a>
</video>

<p>This adolescent <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humpback_whale">humpback whale</a> was about 8m long. It’s unusual to find a whales here, now, so close to the reef, so young, without its family. There was speculation that it might be waiting for its family to pick it up again, or that perhaps it was sick.</p>

<video src="/wiki/2024-04-06-maledives-14.mov" poster="2024-04-06-maledives-14.jpg" width="1920" height="1080" controls muted>

<a alt="Video of the same whale" href="/wiki/2024-04-06-maledives-14.mov">6 second video</a>
</video>

<p><strong>2024-04-13</strong>. To it is raining. Good for Claudia since she is supposed to rest her foot.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-16.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>2024-04-21</strong>. After snorkling with the whale, not much seemed to be worth posting about.</p>

<p>Before going on this trip, I bought an older GoPro HERO 10. Now I have a few gigabytes of reef snorkeling footage. I don&rsquo;t know what to do with it. Post it? Unlikely! It takes too much space and nobody would look at it. Donate it to YouTube? Unlikely! Upload it to some Peertube instance and thereby offload the cost? Unlikely.</p>

<p>Regarding the economy of the Maldives and the shock when I learned about the garbage island and my dismay when I saw the skyline of Malé island – when we flew back, I got a closer look at Malé from the air as we landed and while it wasn&rsquo;t an island nature paradise, it was just a city with nice, tall buildings and roads and palm trees and construction sites and glass fronts and cars and motorcycles. In other words, it seemed like a perfectly normal city and it wasn&rsquo;t shabby and it didn&rsquo;t have slums and so I keep coming back to the main issue: Beating poverty is of ultimate importance in order to improve people&rsquo;s lives and giving them options so that they can work on the problems they care about. When we flew over Thilafushi, the garbage island didn&rsquo;t look &ldquo;apocalyptic&rdquo; but just like some industrial zone elsewhere in the world, except it&rsquo;s an island in the middle of the ocean.</p>

<p><strong>2024-04-24</strong>. Ugh. Seems like Claudia broke her foot, after all. 😰</p>

## How I tricked iOS into giving me EU DMA features

date: 2024-04-24, from: OS News

In iOS 17.4, Apple introduced a new system called eligibilityd. This works with countryd (which you might have heard about when it first appeared in iOS 16.2) and the Apple ID system to decide where you physically are. The idea is that multiple sources need to agree on where you are, before giving you access to features such as those mandated by the Digital Markets Act. ↫ Adam Demasi The way Adam Demasi managed to convince Apple his very much Australian iPhone in Australia was, in fact, a European Union iPhone in the European Union was by making sure not a single wireless signal managed to escape the device. He had to disable location services, insert an Italian SIM, set up a pfSense Wi-Fi router using the regulatory country of Italy, and go into his basement where there&#8217;s no mobile signal. Between all these steps, the phone was reset multiple times. And then, and only then, did the iPhone think it was in the European Union, with all the benefits that entails. Demasi has no idea which of these steps are actually needed, but the process of figuring this all out is ongoing, and more information is sure to be discovered as smart people sink their teeth into the process by which Apple determines where an iPhone is from.

The Dutch, I gather, don&#8217;t have a specific word for &#8216;pothole&#8217; because, well, they don&#8217;t need one.

## OpenBSD as a daily driver

date: 2024-04-24, from: OS News

I always like it when I can link to an article written by an OSNews, and this time it&#8217;s even relevant to me as I&#8217;m exploring OpenBSD myself. OSNews reader and silver Patreon supporter Morgan has written an article about using OpenBSD as a daily driver. OpenBSD is forever tied in first place with Void Linux as my favorite desktop OS. This is particularly funny because OpenBSD isn’t “just a desktop OS”; in its purest form, the base installation without any installed packages, it makes for an excellent Ethernet router, firewall, or web server. It even ships with its own fork of X11 called Xenocara, along with fvwm2 and its own calm window manager, so there’s a rudimentary desktop OS in there too. With that said, in 2024 there is no such thing as a fully functioning desktop computer or workstation without at least a web browser of some kind, and if you’re adding packages you may as well build a full desktop system to suit your needs. So how do you go from the amazing but unfortunately limited base install to a “daily driver” workstation operating system? There are many ways to do this, and I will present a couple of paths I take depending on the hardware and use case involved. Before I do that, a bit of prep is necessary to get OpenBSD into more of a desktop OS mode. ↫ Morgan I&#8217;ll be using this guide over the coming days to make sure I end up with something usable. I still haven&#8217;t decided on what desktop environment I want to go for &#8211; I&#8217;m not interested in running GNOME or KDE, so Xfce is probably the most likely option. I&#8217;d also love to try out LXQt, but it seems the version OpenBSD has in its repositories is very, very outdated (1.0.0 from years ago, when 2.0.0 was just released). There&#8217;s a small chance I might suck it up and use one of those &#8220;build your own desktop environment&#8221; options, but I have no idea which one I should go for.

## 23 Apr 2024

date: 2024-04-24, from: Miguel de Icaza's blog

<h1 id="embeddable-game-engine">Embeddable Game Engine</h1>
<p><img
src="https://migueldeicaza.github.io/SwiftGodotDocs/images/SwiftGodot%20Header.png"
align="right" width=240>
Many years ago, when working at Xamarin, where we were building cross-platform
libraries for mobile developers, we wanted to offer both 2D and 3D gaming
capabilities for our users in the form of adding 2D or 3D content to their
mobile applications.</p>
<p>For 2D, we contributed and developed assorted Cocos2D-inspired libraries.</p>
<p>For 3D, the situation was more complex. We funded a few over the years, and we
contributed to others over the years, but nothing panned out (the
history of this is worth a dedicated post).</p>
<p>Around 2013, we looked around, and there were two contenders at the
time, one was an embeddable engine with many cute features but not great UI
support called Urho, and the other one was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godot_(game_engine)">Godot</a>, which had a great IDE, but
did not support being embedded.</p>
<p>I reached out to Juan at the time to discuss whether Godot could be turned into
such engine.   While I tend to take copious notes of all my meetings, those
notes sadly were gone as part of the Microsoft acquisition, but from what I can
remember Juan told me, &quot;Godot is not what you are looking for&quot; in two dimensions,
there were no immediate plans to turn it into an embeddable library, and it was
not as advanced as Urho, so he recommended that I go with Urho.</p>
<p>We invested heavily in binding Urho and created
<a href="https://github.com/xamarin/urho">UrhoSharp</a> that would go into becoming a <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/xamarin/bring-3d-models-life-augmented-reality-urhosharp/">great
3D library for our C# users</a> and worked not only on every desktop and mobile
platform, but we did a ton of work to make it great for AR and VR headsets.
Sadly, Microsoft's management left UrhoSharp to die.</p>
<p>Then, the maintainer of Urho stepped down, and Godot became one of the most
popular open-source projects in the world.</p>
<p>Last year, @Faolan-Rad <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/72883">contributed a patch to Godot</a> to turn it into a library
that could be embedded into applications.   I used this library to build
<a href="https://github.com/migueldeicaza/SwiftGodotKit">SwiftGodotKit</a> and have been
very happy with it ever since - allowing people to embed Godot content into
their application.</p>
<p>However, the patch had severe limitations; it could only ever run one Godot game as
an embedded system and could not do much more.   The folks at <a href="https://www.smirk.gg">Smirk
Software</a> wanted to take this further. They wanted to host
independent Godot scenes in their app and have more control over those so
they could sprinkle Godot content at their heart's content on their mobile app (<a href="https://x.com/JoshBromberg1/status/1721564103859114132">demo</a>)</p>
<p>They funded some initial work to do this and hired <a href="https://migeran.com">Gergely
Kis's company</a> to do this work.</p>
<p>Gergely demoed this work at GodotCon last year.   I came back very excited from
GodotCon and I decided to turn my <a href="https://x.com/migueldeicaza/status/1723765594653167892">prototype Godot on iPad</a> into a <a href="https://blog.la-terminal.net/igodot/">complete
product</a>.</p>
<p>One of the features that I needed was the ability to embed chunks of Godot in
discrete components in my iPad UI, so we worked with Gergely to productize and
polish this patch for general consumption.</p>
<p>Now, there is a <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/90510">complete patch under review</a> to allow people to embed arbitrary
Godot scenes into their apps.   For SwiftUI users, this means that you can embed a Godot scene into a <code>View</code> and display and control it at will.</p>
<p>Hopefully, the team will accept this change into Godot, and once this is done, I will
update SwiftGodotKit to get these new capabilities to Swift users (bindings for
other platforms and languages are left as an exercise to the reader).</p>
<p>It only took a decade after talking to Juan, but I am back firmly in Godot land.</p>

## Common views and questions about metadata across Africa

date: 2024-04-24, from: Crossref Blog

<p>This past year has been a captivating journey of immersion within the Crossref community, a mix of online interactions and meaningful in-person experiences. From the engaging Sustainability Research and Innovation Conference in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, to the impactful webinars conducted globally, this has been more than just a professional endeavour; it has been a personal exploration of collaboration, insights, and a shared commitment to pushing the boundaries of scholarly communication.</p>
<h2 id="working-collaboratively-with-research-funders-and-research-organisations">Working collaboratively with research funders and research organisations</h2>
<div style="float:right;margin:10px">
<figure class="img-responsive"><img src="https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2024/cocreation-activity-SRI.JPG"

<p>Cocreation activity in smaller groups at the SRI conference.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The adventure began with a significant in-person event, the Sustainability Research and Innovation Conference. In the coastal city of Port Elizabeth, South Africa, I had the honour of hosting a parallel co-creation session titled &ldquo;Connecting Science to Society: A Network Approach to Improving Science Communication in the Global South.&rdquo; The co-creation session addressed research discoverability and accessibility among early-career researchers. Apart from some immediate feedback from the researchers in the room about how they might use co-creation beyond the conference to improve their research experience and outcome, I also had conversations with research funders from the Belmont Forum, Future Earth, and National Research Foundation - South Africa and the National Research Foundation - Mozambique about connecting their grants and grantees with their published outputs referencing Crossref’s <a href="https://www.crossref.org/services/funder-registry/" target="_blank">Open Funder Registry</a> and <a href="https://www.crossref.org/community/grants/" target="_blank">research grants registration</a>. A different side conversation was about a community organisation in Botswana that is interested in registering patents with Crossref for proper referencing and protecting the intellectual property of their research on the indigenous communities’ innovations and the associated published work. These conversations are ongoing, unveiling a new understanding of unique needs and opportunities to pursue with research funders and research organisations working on indigenous knowledge and innovations.</p>
<h2 id="learning-from-organisations-in-gem-eligible-countries">Learning from organisations in GEM-eligible countries</h2>
<p>The journey extended globally through a series of webinars conducted in Bangladesh, Tanzania, Nepal, and Ghana. Collaborating with dedicated Ambassadors and my colleagues leading the <a href="https://www.crossref.org/gem/" target="_blank">Global Equitable Membership (GEM) program</a>, we witnessed an increase in Crossref membership from the GEM countries and initial metadata registration. The GEM Program offers relief from both Crossref membership and Crossref content registration fees for organisations in the least economically advantaged countries in the world, based on the World Bank&rsquo;s IDA list. Susan, in her blog post, &ldquo;<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/the-gem-program-year-one/" target="_blank">The GEM Program: Year One</a>&rdquo;, elaborated on the significance of these efforts and their impact on fostering equitable access to scholarly resources and communication through the expansion of Crossref&rsquo;s membership base in underrepresented regions, such as Bangladesh, Tanzania, Nepal, and Ghana. Specific concerns encountered while presenting the GEM program included feedback expressing reservations about the program&rsquo;s approach, particularly in deciding on eligible countries, and advocating eligibility for the program to be extended to all the non-GEM countries in Africa. Additionally, a conversation with some organisations brought up concerns regarding the program&rsquo;s sustainability, with inquiries about whether GEM was merely a free trial or freemium service, and seeking assurances against future fees. The audience found these sessions helpful, acknowledging that joining fees were no longer going to be a barrier, yet questions about the program&rsquo;s longevity brought out the need for sustained support.</p>
<h2 id="discussing-how-the-research-nexus-can-support-the-community">Discussing how The Research Nexus can support the community</h2>
<p>My journey then led me to Makerere University in Uganda for the Consortium of Uganda University Libraries (CUUL 2023) conference and the Forum for Open Research in MENA (FORM 2023) in Abu Dhabi. In Uganda, I noticed the synergy between university libraries, institutional repositories, and the research and education network service provider formed a consortium that played a crucial role in bridging the digital gap and supporting the adoption of open infrastructure. The event was mainly attended by librarians from different universities in Uganda. Most of those I connected with needed more information about Crossref and had questions about how Crossref DOIs are different from ARKs, which they commonly use in their publishing workflows. At FORM 2023, in my presentation titled, &ldquo;The Research Nexus: A Rich and Reusable Open Network of Relationships in the Scholarly Record,&rdquo; I shared Crossref&rsquo;s vision for a connected research ecosystem with the audience that comprised of researchers, research administrators, and funders, and a good number of big publishers like IEEE and Taylor &amp; Francis. The <a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/the-gem-program-year-one/" target="_blank">Research Nexus</a> seeks to reveal relationships beyond persistent identifiers, utilising rich metadata to connect various scholarly components. I also took the opportunity at both events to share about <a href="https://theplace.discourse.group/" target="_blank">The Publishers Learning And Community Exchange (PLACE)</a>, an online forum promoting best practices in scholarly publishing. The goal was to show attendees how they can actively contribute to and benefit from this vision, fostering a robust and interconnected research community through Crossref&rsquo;s open infrastructure.</p>

<p>I enjoyed the opportunity to join the National Open Science Dialogue by TCC Africa, which provided crucial insights, emphasising the need for assessing awareness, implementing comprehensive policies, and fostering collaboration around Open Science. Higher education institutions were recognized as influencers in the global Open Science movement, while a call for an inclusive research environment was underscored through open access and data sharing. The dialogue emphasized a collective effort involving policymakers, educators, researchers, and institutions, focusing on inclusivity and collaboration to advance Open Science in East Africa.</p>
<h2 id="exploring-how-rich-metadata-can-provide-trust-signals-with-members-in-kenya">Exploring how rich metadata can provide trust signals with members in Kenya</h2>
<p>Reflecting on the Crossref Nairobi event that happened in February 2024, it was an enriching experience exploring key issues shaping scholarly publishing in Kenya. The discussions also touched on the role of metadata as a trust signal and a tool for the persistence of the scholarly record, particularly in regions where data protection challenges persist. This is exemplified by concerns raised during the event about the fear of data theft, misuse, or loss, especially in places with comparatively weaker data protection laws. The presence of robust metadata, particularly with detailed provenance information, becomes crucial in such contexts, as it enables better identification and handling of potential misuse. Thus, through effective metadata implementation and the persistence facilitated by identifiers, the management of data risks can be significantly improved.</p>
<p>The insights from existing Crossref members pointed out contextual challenges, regional differences, and the importance of effective post-publication processes. The conference served as a valuable platform for dialogue, emphasising the collective commitment to continuous improvement of scholarly communication in the country, and the need for continuous awareness and training on making the most of Crossref services. The roundtable discussions during the Crossmark service consultation brought to light various reflections and considerations regarding post-publication changes in publishing workflows. The Crossmark service was a new discovery for most participants, with potential value recognized in facilitating current updates on articles. However, there are existing barriers such as a lack of awareness and technical expertise, suggesting the need for further education to facilitate adoption. Overall, the consultation provided a platform for introspection and exploration of avenues for improving post-publication practices in scholarly publishing.</p>

<p>We organised the Crossref Nairobi event with the help of colleagues from the outreach team and local Ambassadors, Mercury Shitindo of Kenya, Baraka Ngussa of Tanzania and our Board Members in Kenya, Oscar Donde. It was the first time I saw both my colleagues and Ambassadors in action and working closely together - making presentations and accommodating last-minute facilitation changes to the program. Compared to attending or speaking at an event, organising one was a unique experience requiring a lot of planning in advance for logistics and the event program, identifying and keeping in touch with important stakeholders, ushering guests and being on standby for any matters that come up about the event. All of that went very well thanks to the team on the ground and cooperative participants.</p>
<h2 id="exploring-the-role-of-open-infrastructure-for-african-universities">Exploring the role of open infrastructure for African universities</h2>
<p>Attending the recent WACREN 2024 conference was an eye-opening experience, unfolding the role of open infrastructure in addressing challenges faced by African universities. A focus on open access systems and advocacy for decolonizing knowledge were voiced too, including challenges of affordability of DOIs and questions of local ownership amidst global initiatives. Global persistent identifier providers, including ORCID and DataCite too, had a presence at the conference, alongside passionate advocates for more locally managed, decentralised infrastructure. These are concerns that Crossref needs to understand better, as we seek to find effective ways of supporting equitable participation in the Research Nexus. The conference resonated with a call for continued work in fostering accessibility, sharing, and leveraging resources to accelerate research and innovation in Africa.</p>

<p>Conversations with Crossref Ambassadors brought about a shared narrative across universities in some African countries. These institutions are actively embracing digital shifts, setting up institutional repositories using platforms like DSpace and OJS. However, challenges persist, particularly in funding and technical capacity. It&rsquo;s heartening to see how national and regional research and education networks step in to help in internet connectivity, opening up collaboration opportunities with other interoperable infrastructure, setting up repositories, providing hosting services and event managing content identifiers.</p>
<p>Deceptive publishing practices remain a shared concern, and we’ve had requests at these meetings for stricter inclusion criteria for membership of Crossref to ensure quality and trustworthiness of articles accessible through Crossref metadata.</p>
<p>We’ve explained to those we’ve met that Crossref doesn’t (and can’t) assess the quality of content or the integrity of the research process. We don’t have the people or the skills, and it isn’t our mission to be the gatekeepers of research quality. A DOI record is just an indication that something was published, it isn’t an indication of quality.</p>
<p>However, we do still have a vital role in preserving the integrity of the scholarly record. We provide the infrastructure which enables those who produce scholarly outputs to provide metadata (effectively evidence) about how they ensure the quality of content and how the outputs fit into the scholarly record. The scholarly record - that network of published outputs, inputs, relationships and contexts - is captured through the metadata records that our members register with us, and that we then distribute freely and openly through our API. The richer and more comprehensive Crossref records are, the more context there is for our members and for the whole scholarly research ecosystem to make their own decisions around trustworthiness. Blocking access to the infrastructure creates gaps in the scholarly record, but also potentially blocks legitimate newcomers.</p>
<p>“Crossref is focused on enriching metadata to provide more and better trust signals while keeping barriers to membership and participation as low as possible to enable an inclusive scholarly record.”

<p>While the landscape of digital scholarly publication witnesses significant strides, a crucial need persists, the importance of preserving and interconnecting metadata to the global scholarly record. It&rsquo;s not just about discoverability, a theme resonating strongly within the community, but about enabling reproducibility, upholding research and editorial integrity, and facilitating reporting and assessment.</p>
<h2 id="the-path-forward">The path forward</h2>
<p>As I reflect on this year of immersing myself within the Crossref community, building awareness in new communities, and learning more about the different perceptions across the region, it feels like a personal progression of growth and discovery. From the captivating in-person moments to the global webinars and collaborative efforts to address challenges in scholarly communication, this journey is not just a professional pursuit; it&rsquo;s a personal exploration. The path forward involves continued support, intensified awareness-building, and sustained dialogue, ensuring that the scholarly ecosystem continues to thrive, evolve, and leave a lasting impact.</p>

## The man who killed Google Search

date: 2024-04-23, from: OS News

These emails — which I encourage you to look up — tell a dramatic story about how Google’s finance and advertising teams, led by Raghavan with the blessing of CEO Sundar Pichai, actively worked to make Google worse to make the company more money. This is what I mean when I talk about the Rot Economy — the illogical, product-destroying mindset that turns the products you love into torturous, frustrating quasi-tools that require you to fight the company’s intentions to get the service you want. ↫ Edward Zitron Quite the read.

## Fedora 40 released with KDE Plasma 6 and GNOME 46

date: 2024-04-23, from: OS News

It&#8217;s a big day for Fedora users such as myself &#8211; and especially for Fedora KDE users, also such as myself. Fedora 40 has been released today, and while the main focus is always on the GNOME release &#8211; although not everyone is happy about that &#8211; the various other spins, in Fedora parlance, have also seen major updates. Most prominently among them is the KDE spin, which ships with KDE&#8217;s recent megarelease, KDE Plasma 6. Starting at the top, Fedora 40 Workstation comes with the latest GNOME release, 46, which we covered when it was released earlier this year. It also comes with IPV4 Address Conflict Detection to resolve duplicate IPV4 addresses in the same physical network, and the PyTorch machine learning framework is now in the Fedora software repositories for easier installation and implementation by developers &#8211; a harbinger of what&#8217;s to come. The KDE spin comes, as already mentioned, with KDE Plasma 6, and inherits the non-GNOME improvements and fixes as well, of course. There&#8217;s also countless other spins covering pretty much every desktop environment and window manager under the sun, and Fedora 40 is also the first release to implement the new naming scheme for Fedora&#8217;s various immutable editions &#8211; the Atomic Desktops.

I'd like to combine AI and search to make a really great search engine for bloggers.

And when we browse, <i>it knows which blog we write.</i> So it has a very good idea of what we mean when we ask a question and what we already know.

Hot on the heels of NetBSD 10.0 comes NetBSD 9.4, a minor release in the previous release branch. NetBSD 9.4 is primarily a bug and security fix release, however, there are some new features, such as support for more MegaRAID controllers, ZTE MF112 and D-Link DWM222 USB 3G modems, and improved CPU feature detection for newer AMD/Intel devices. All users of netbsd-9 should upgrade if they are not following the stable branch. ↫ NetBSD 9.4 release announcement A very important note here is that the version of OpenSSL in NetBSD 9.4 is no longer supported unless you have a support contract with OpenSSL. They suggest upgrading to NetBSD 10.0, or to use OpenSSL from pkgsrc.

## Tribblix SPARC milestone 30 released

date: 2024-04-23, from: OS News

Tribblix, the unique ilumos distribution &#8211; think Solaris &#8211; has a new SPARC milestone. It&#8217;s one of the few platforms still actively supporting SPARC, so even if the amount of users might be slim, I think it&#8217;s an important contribution to the ecosystem. The application software here roughly corresponds to m34 on x86 systems, although the underlying illumos is still closer to m25/m26. Note that there are no functional illumos changes from the m28 sparc release &#8211; if that release didn&#8217;t work on your system, this one won&#8217;t either. ↫ Peter Tribble I&#8217;m still looking for my mythical, unobtanium Sun Ultra 45, a goal farther away now than it&#8217;s ever been (Patreon maybe? One-time donation? Help me out after I took OSNews full-time?), and the SPARC version of Tribblix would be my first go-to.

## Making a flute controlled mouse

date: 2024-04-23, from: OS News

There is something about surprising interfaces: clapping to switch on lights is more fun than a flipping a switch. Pressing a panic-button to order a pizza is more fun than ordering via an app. Recently I came across this surprising interface: a flute controlled mouse cursor for a first person shooter. I recognize a good idea when I see one, and immediately wanted replicate the idea and make it freely available. So I got to work. ↫ Joren Six I don&#8217;t think I have ever seen something quite so unique.

## 2024-04-22 Gopher, again

date: 2024-04-23, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-04-22-gopher-again">2024-04-22 Gopher, again</h1>

<p>Having found a separate server, written in Go, monitored by systemd, to be the superior solution for double hosting my site for Gemini, I kept thinking about Gopher. With <a href="Odd%C2%B5">Oddµ</a> using a version of Markdown that is very close to the standard, and having found a library that I understand, more or less, which I had successfully grafted onto <a href="https://sr.ht/~gsthnz/satellite/">Satellite</a>, the Gemini server I’m using, based on renderer code I found in the <a href="https://github.com/tdemin/gmnhg">Hugo-to-Gemini converter</a> that used the same Markdown parsing library I was using for Oddµ, I figured that I might use the same library to turn Markdown into suitable Gopher pages.</p>

<p>It took some wrangling and it’s probably not great, but the main menu matches my front page and the blog posts look mostly OK, and so the site is back as a gopher hole on port 70!</p>

<p>See <a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/markdown-gopher.git">Markdown Gopher</a> for the Gopher server code.</p>

## Paying for it doesn’t make it a market

date: 2024-04-22, from: OS News

Cory Doctorow, nailing it as usual. If you care about how people are treated by platforms, you can&#8217;t just tell them to pay for services instead of using ad-supported media. The most important factor in getting decent treatment out of a tech company isn&#8217;t whether you pay with cash instead of attention – it&#8217;s whether you&#8217;re locked in, and thus a flight risk whom the platform must cater to. ↫ Cory Doctorow I&#8217;m sick and tired of the phrase &#8220;if you&#8217;re not paying for the product, you&#8217;re the product&#8221;, because it implies that if just you pay for a product or service, you&#8217;re not going to be treated like ass. The problem is, as Doctorow points out, that this simply is not supported by the evidence, and that it isn&#8217;t whether or not you&#8217;re paying that makes you have a good or bad experience &#8211; it&#8217;s whether or not you&#8217;re locked in. If you&#8217;ve got nowhere else to go, then corporations can treat you like ass. There are so, so many free services and products I use where I&#8217;m anything but a &#8220;product&#8221;. My Linux distribution of choice, Fedora. My web browser, Firefox. The countless open source applications I use on my desktops, laptops, and smartphone. Those are all cases where even though I&#8217;m not paying, I know I&#8217;m being treated with respect, and I feel entirely comfortable with all of those. And no, you don&#8217;t get to exclude the open source world just because it&#8217;s inconvenient for the &#8220;you&#8217;re the product&#8221; argument. There are also countless services and products where the opposite is true; I&#8217;m a paying customer, but I still feel like I&#8217;m the product. I pay for additional Google Drive storage. I pay for an Office 364 subscription because I needed it as a translator (I&#8217;m working on OSNews full-time now, and could use your help keeping the site going), but I can&#8217;t cancel it because my wife, my parents, and my parents-in-law use that same subscription. We pay for Netflix and one or two other video services. I don&#8217;t know if our ISP or wireless provider do anything malicious, but it wouldn&#8217;t surprise me. And so on. Being a paying customer means nothing. It&#8217;s how easy it is for you to stop being a customer that matters.

## Facebook opens its Android-based Quest operating system to other VR device makers

date: 2024-04-22, from: OS News

Today we’re taking the next step toward our vision for a more open computing platform for the metaverse. We’re opening up the operating system powering our Meta Quest devices to third-party hardware makers, giving more choice to consumers and a larger ecosystem for developers to build for. We’re working with leading global technology companies to bring this new ecosystem to life and making it even easier for developers to build apps and reach their audiences on the platform.  Meta Horizon OS is the result of a decade of work by Meta to build a next-generation computing platform. To pioneer standalone headsets, we developed technologies like inside-out tracking, and for more natural interaction systems and social presence, we developed eye, face, hand, and body tracking. For mixed reality, we built a full stack of technologies for blending the digital and physical worlds, including high-resolution Passthrough, Scene Understanding, and Spatial Anchors. This long-term investment that began on the mobile-first foundations of the Android Open Source Project has produced a full mixed reality operating system used by millions of people. ↫ Facebook&#8217;s blog In summary, Facebook wants the operating system of their Quest series of virtual reality devices &#8211; an Android Open Source Project fork optimised for this use &#8211; to become the default platform for virtual reality devices from all kinds of OEMs. Today, they&#8217;re announcing that both Asus and Lenovo will be releasing devices running this Meta Horizon OS, with the former focusing on high-end VR gaming, and the latter on more general use cases of work, entertainment, and so on. Facebook will also be working together with Microsoft to create a Quest &#8220;inspired by Xbox&#8221;. The Meta Quest Store, the on-device marketplace for applications and games, will be renamed to the Meta Horizon Store, and the App Lab, where developers can more easily get their applications and games on devices and in the hands of consumers as long as they meet basic technical and content guidelines, will be integrated into the Meta Horizon Store for easier access than before. In addition, in a mildly spicy move, Facebook is openly inviting Google to bring the Google Play Store to the VR Android fork, &#8220;where it can operate with the same economic model it does on other platforms&#8221;. The odds of me buying anything from Facebook are slim, so I really hope this new move won&#8217;t corner the market for VR headsets right out of the gate; I don&#8217;t want another Android/iOS duopoly. I&#8217;m not particularly interested in VR quite yet &#8211; but give it a few more years, and I certainly won&#8217;t pass up on a capable device that allows me to play Beat Saber and other exercise-focused applications and games. I just don&#8217;t want it to be a Facebook device or operating system.

A brief follow-up to this post from last week: In our current climate of political assholery, no self-described “activist” can answer what I think of as an essential question: If you get what you want, what will be the costs? Every choice — every choice ever made by every human being — carries costs. Some [&#8230;]

## New version of Tiny11 Builder lets you debloat any Windows 11 build or version

date: 2024-04-22, from: OS News

The maker of Tiny11, a third-party project that aims to make Windows 11 less bloated with unnecessary parts, released a new version of Tiny11 Builder, a special tool that lets you create a custom Windows 11 image tailored to your needs and preferences. The latest release makes it much easier to create a lightweight Windows 11 ISO without worrying about installing a system modified by unknown third parties. ↫ Taras Buria at Neowin Perhaps you can make Windows 11 slightly more bearable with this. If there&#8217;s any interest from y&#8217;all, I could build my own debloated Windows 11 install and see if I can make this platform bearable for myself? Let me know in the comments.

## Inside the Super Nintendo cartridges

date: 2024-04-22, from: OS News

One of the remarkable characteristics of the Super Nintendo was the ability for game cartridges (cart) to pack more than instructions and assets into ROM chips. If we open and look at the PCBs, we can find inside things like the CIC copy protection chip, SRAM, and even &#8220;enhancement processors&#8221;. ↫ Fabien Sanglard When I was a child and teenager in the &#8217;90s, the capabilities of the SNES cartridge were a bit of a legend. We&#8217;d talk about what certain games would use which additional processors and chips in the cartridge, right or wrong, often boasting about the games we owned, and talking down the games we didn&#8217;t. Much of it was probably nonsense, but there&#8217;s some good memories there. We&#8217;re decades deep into the internet age now, and all the mysteries of the SNES cartridge can just be looked up on Wikipedia and endless numbers of other websites. The mystery&#8217;s all gone, but at least now we can accurately marvel at just how versatile the SNES really was.

## Episode 130 - ALGOL, Part II

date: 2024-04-21, from: Advent of Computing

<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">This is a hefty one. I usually try to keep things as accessible as possible, but this time we have to get a little more technical than usual. We are picking up in 1964, with the first proposals for a new version of ALGOL. From there we sail through the fraught waters of ALGOL X, Y, W, and finally 68. Along the way we see how a language evolves over time, and how people and politics mesh with technical issues.</p> <p>Selected Sources:</p> <p><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.5555/1061112.1061118" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-link-auto= "">https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.5555/1061112.1061118</a> - Successes and Failures of the ALGOL Effort</p> <p><a href="https://sci-hub.se/10.1109/MAHC.2010.8" rel= "noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-link-auto= "">https://sci-hub.se/10.1109/MAHC.2010.8</a> - Cold War Origins of IFIP</p> <p><a href= "https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/algol/algol_bulletin/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-link-auto= "">https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/algol/algol_bulletin/</a> - The ALGOL Bulletin</p>

## Niri 0.1.5 released

date: 2024-04-21, from: OS News

Earlier this year, we talked about Niri, a very unique tiling window manager for Wayland that scrolls infinitely to the right. I&#8217;ve never seen anything quite like it, and while it seems polarising, I think it&#8217;s absolutely worthy of a dedicated niche. The project&#8217;s got a major new release out, and there&#8217;s a lot of improvements here. First and foremost, virtually all animations have been overhauled, and new ones have been added for almost every kind of interaction. The videos on the release page do a really good job of highlighting what they&#8217;re going for, and I think it looks great, and for the animation-averse, every individual animation can be turned off. Niri now also supports variable refresh rate, and the IPC mechanism has been improved. Among the smaller improvements is a welcome one: when using the touchscreen, the mouse cursor disappears. I really think this one has to be tried before judged, and I&#8217;m seriously contemplating setting up a Wayland environment just for this one, to see if it works for me. My window &#8220;flow&#8221;, if that makes sense, is already left-to-right, so the idea of having that effectively automated with an infinite canvas sounds very appealing to me, especially on smaller displays. I just need to figure out if it works in reality.

## Lunatik: a framework for scripting the Linux kernel with Lua

date: 2024-04-21, from: OS News

Lunatik is a framework for scripting the Linux kernel with Lua. It is composed by the Lua interpreter modified to run in the kernel; a device driver (written in Lua =)) and a command line tool to load and run scripts and manage runtime environments from the user space; a C API to load and run scripts and manage runtime environments from the kernel; and Lua APIs for binding kernel facilities to Lua scripts. ↫ Lunatik GitHub page I&#8217;m not knowledgeable enough to understand what this might be used for, but I figured y&#8217;all would be interested in this.
