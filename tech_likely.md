## Hurricane Season Begins

date: 2024-05-31, from: NASA breaking news

June 1 marks the beginning of the 2024 hurricane season in the Atlantic Ocean. NASA observes and studies hurricanes from space, both with views from the space station and with satellites. This vantage point helps scientists understand how climate change impacts hurricanes and learn how communities can better prepare for tropical cyclones in a warmer [&#8230;]

## NASA Mission Flies Over Arctic to Study Sea Ice Melt Causes

date: 2024-05-31, from: NASA breaking news

It’s not just rising air and water temperatures influencing the decades-long decline of Arctic sea ice. Clouds, aerosols, even the bumps and dips on the ice itself can play a role. To explore how these factors interact and impact sea ice melting, NASA is flying two aircraft equipped with scientific instruments over the Arctic Ocean [&#8230;]

## Servo sees another month full of improvements

date: 2024-05-31, from: OS News

Servo, the Rust-based browser engine originally started by Mozilla but since spun off into an entity under the umbrella of the Linux Foundation, has published another monthly update. As almost every month, there&#8217;s been a lot of progress on rendering tech I don&#8217;t quite understand, and further improved support for various standards. Another major focus is the ongoing font system rework, which is yielding not only vastly improved support for font rendering options, but is also reducing the memory load. The example browser included in Servo is also making progress, from reducing the amount of errors on Windows, to implementing support for using extra mouse buttons to go back and forward, and showing the link desination when hovering the mouse over a link.

Space, the saying goes, is hard. And the farther humans go, the harder it can get. Some of the challenges on missions to explore the Moon and Mars include preventing microbial contamination of these destinations, navigating there safely, protecting crew members and hardware from radiation, and maintaining and repairing equipment. Research on the International Space [&#8230;]

## 25 years of Krita

date: 2024-05-31, from: OS News

Twenty-five years. A quarter century. That&#8217;s how long we&#8217;ve been working on Krita. Well, what would become Krita. It started out as KImageShop, but that name was nuked by a now long-dead German lawyer. Then it was renamed to Krayon, and that name was also nuked. Then it was renamed to Krita, and that name stuck. I only became part of Krita in 2003, when Krita was still part of KDE&#8217;s suite of productivity applications, KOffice, later renamed to Calligra&#8230; And I became maintainer of Krita in 2004, when Patrick Julien handed over the baton. That means that I&#8217;ve been around Krita for about twenty of those twenty-five years, so I&#8217;ll hope you, dear reader, will forgive me for making this a really personal post; a very large part of my life has been tied up with Krita, and it&#8217;s going to show. ↫ Krita website While it may not be as popular as something like LibreOffice due to fewer people needing it, Krita is a cornerstone application of the Linux desktop (it&#8217;s also available for Windows and macOS), and I honestly can barely believe it&#8217;s been around for this long. I&#8217;m about as far removed from being an artistic painter as a squirrel&#8217;s tail is from being a functioning propeller engine so I don&#8217;t have need for Krita, but I&#8217;m always surprised by how many people mention using it for their painting endeavours. I wish the project and its developers another successful 25 years, and they&#8217;re going to need it &#8211; Krita 5.3 is coming soon(ish), and the much more involved Krita 6.0, which makes the jump fro Qt 5 to Qt 6, is also in the works. On a personal note, I&#8217;m online acquainted with the lead maintainer of Krita, and as she alludes to at the end of the article, COVID hit her hard, and maintaining such a huge open source project isn&#8217;t easy to begin with. Much respect for keeping it up, and of course, to everyone else contributing to the project.

## Can the Raspberry Pi 5 handle 4K?

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-05-31, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

Perhaps I should add a new element to the <a href="http://source.scripting.com/">source namespace</a>, the name of the author of a blog, if the feed is for a blog. Here's why I need it. I am building my blogroll. Every time I find an insightful story about using tech I use, these days esp AI, I add it to my blogroll so I get to see any new articles they write when they post. But if their blog has a catchy name, I'll never pick it out of the list as I scan for something new to read. I need the name of the author too. Basically a blogger should provide their name, but of course it's completely optional. I'll subscribe anyway, if the article is on-topic. I'm soaking this stuff up now, building my own personal firehose.

## Tech is about people

date: 2024-05-31, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Once again we're at the beginning of a huge tech-induced transformation, and yet again the people who already occupy a high rung of the ladder of success, or imagine they do, are pissing all over it, without using it.</p>
<p>I remember <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kvell">kvelling</a> about Napster, about how the ability to program my own music had made it possible for me to explore my own life in new ways, because music is inexorably bound to memory. For me the big revelation came on <a href="http://scripting.com/2000/06/18.html">Father's Day in 2000</a> when I heard <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zaCV4niKk">Father and Son</a> by Cat Stevens on the radio and desperately wanted to hear it again. </p>
<p>I had tried Napster a few months earlier and found that it had none of my music. It was basically just a technology demo. I tried it again, and this time not only did it have the Cat Stevens song, but it had every song from my childhood that I hadn't heard since being a kid listening to WABC on the transistor radio my grandfather gave me for my birthday when I was five or six years old.</p>
<p>I told this story at a Future of Music conference and was torn apart by the other people on stage, supposedly creative people, who cared not one bit about how people used the product they created, and the power of being able to program our own music. They were the bosses of music and my job was merely to give them money and admiration and stfu. They tried to get me off the stage (I was the moderator) but I stood my ground and of course never forgot.</p>
<p>It happened again a few years later at the DNC in Boston, when the journalists mocked the bloggers because we had no experience as journalists, and they didn't like the way we dressed (they wrote articles about it, in the NYT even). 20+ years later they're still complaining, but they forget to blame us for their misery, now. Their misery is they forget the glory of their job, which is empowering us -- their users -- to change the world that so desperately needs changing. </p>
<p>It's happening again with AI, which is opening up creative expression to people who can't draw, or aren't good writers, or people who want to be better programmers, or who knows -- this technology is the most powerful I've used in my long life in tech. </p>
<p>The difference is -- you have to use something before your criticism makes any sense. That was the mistake the music industry made with Napster. What the journalists made regarding bloggers (we're they're sources, tried to say over and over but they don't listen they just like to talk and be admired and our job as usual is to give them money and stfu). </p>
<p>My very good friend Doc Searls sees it the same way. He calls it <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2024/05/28/the-peoples-ai/">People's AI</a>. We're going to build this out the way we did it with blogging and podcasting a few years ago. It may be our last rodeo, we're getting on in years, but I'm so glad I lived to see this.</p>
<p>(Sidebar: The people who run tech companies today have no idea how to build new technology markets, the categories they occupy were built by others, now gone. I finally figured that's our disconnect and why products lose important features when they are taken over by the inheritors, and why the leaders of Google et al have no idea where to put AI for users to build with it, or even that the users build the stuff they use in tech. Say what you want about Jack, Ev and Biz, but they understood this idea and they did let the users lead.)</p>
<p>And btw, don't miss that it was twelve of us, twelve people, that finally said what the ladder-occupiers have failed to say for far too long about Trump -- he's a felon. We've known that, but when did Obama, Biden, Moscow Mitch or anyone else with a name or reputation to protect say the most obvious truth. They're all powerless and weak, and if we want to get out of this mess we're going to have to lead ourselves. Waiting for them, that didn't work. </p>
<p>PS: Thanks to Twitter for increasing the character limit, so I can <a href="https://x.com/davewiner/status/1796516437281935415">write my blog posts</a> on my iPad before starting my day. Like this. ;-)</p>
<p>PPS: BTW -- here's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zaCV4niKk">the song</a>. Somehow the music industry survived my ability to share this song with you and my future self.</p>
<p>PPPS: I write these pieces with specific people in mind but I rarely say who they are because it embarrasses them. But I write <i>all</i> my pieces the my regular readers, who keep me going, almost 30 years (on Oct 10 this year). I hope they build great things with these ideas, and they let me help them do it. </p>
<p>PPPPS: Doc tends to write brilliant pieces that perfectly describe these points in time. Let's travel back to 1997, as Steve Jobs is returning to Apple, when <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/stories/DocSearlsonSteveJobs.html">Doc explained</a> that while he loves me, Steve loves no one but Steve. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span></p>
<p>PPPPPS: The motto for the podcasting community as it was booting up in 2004 was "users and developers party together." That was the thing that Adam and I agreed on. Adam being the user, and I being the developer. Of course it was his trying to be a developer, and me trying to be a user that was the spark that created the boom. We both made it safe for amateurs to do what we do. That's why podcasting, unlike the music industry, never went to war with its users.  <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">💥</span></p>

<hr />
<h2>Let's start from the basics: can you introduce yourself?</h2>
<p>I'm Matthew Graybosch of Long Island in New York. I'm a GenX college dropout with delusions of erudition, a long-haired metalhead, and an incorrigible nerd. I'm a man of modest means and plebeian tastes, and if this post seems disjointed, it is because I am large and contain multitudes.</p>
<p>I had majored in computer science but I regret not saying be damned to the naysayers and going for a liberal arts degree. Then again, I probably should have just become an electrician; it's a union job in a skilled trade and not particularly amenable to outsourcing or automation.</p>
<p>Instead, I build software for a living — a job that pays well but often feels like building cathedrals atop quicksand — and make a hobby of writing science fantasy inspired by heavy metal and prog rock. Nothing I've written would be mistaken by a discerning reader for a towering work of literature, but I had a hell of a lot of fun writing it, and I've given readings from my work at the World Fantasy Convention. I'm also a terrible musician; I can stay on beat and in tune, and play three instruments poorly: viola, piano, and bass guitar. I have an uncle who does philosophy for a living; I merely dabble in it, since I'm one of those techies who gets curious about areas outside his expertise and sometimes develops opinions about them, too. Worse, I sometimes express them on my website, though you may find I am somewhat more progressive in many of my opinions than the typical Hacker News commenter.</p>
<p>I currently live and work in central Pennsylvania. I'm technically a homeowner, but all that means right now is that my landlord is a bank, my rent isn't subject to annual increases, and I'm much less likely to hear my neighbors having sex or domestic disputes. It still beats being a renter.</p>
<p>I have a relatively anodyne and corporate-friendly "professional" website at <a href="https://matthewgraybosch.com/">matthewgraybosch.com</a>, but my personal website is at <a href="https://starbreaker.org/">starbreaker.org</a> and that's where I let my hair down and speak my mind straight from the heart (with <a href="https://starbreaker.org/blog/rants/disdain-profanity-luxury-belief/index.html">liberal use of profanity</a>).</p>
<p>I tend to use the alias "starbreaker" online. I grabbed it out of an old Judas Priest song from their <em>Sin After Sin</em> album, but apparently it's also the name of a DC super-villain from the 1970s that nobody gives a damn about anymore. It's also a super-weapon in the Xeelee sequence of sf novels by Stephen Baxter. But I just didn't want to use "Stormbringer"; there were too many of those online in 1996.</p>
<p>However, when I play <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> I'm <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/character/40706699/">Naomi Bradleigh</a>. You can blame my wife Catherine for that; she loves to play around with character creation in RPGs, she tends to make characters based on characters from <a href="https://starbreaker.org/fiction/">my fiction</a>, and Naomi is one of her favorites: a swashbuckling soprano catgirl whose demon sword (which was forged of a stable transuranic heavy metal not yet seated at the periodic table) has figured out how to talk to her over 802.11 wireless networking and thinks that <em>The Dreaming City</em> by Michael Moorcock and <em>Gate of Ivrel</em> by C. J. Cherryh are fun bedtime stories.</p>
<p>Besides, I <a href="https://starbreaker.org/blog/entertainment/playing-woman-ffxiv/index.html">already pretend to be a man in real life</a>. Why also do it in <a href="https://starbreaker.org/blog/rants/choose-life-problem-video-games/index.html">a massively multiplayer online power fantasy</a>?</p>
<p>I suppose I should mention my day job. For my sins, I work a full-stack developer working at one of the US' Big Four consulting firms. They've got me typecast as a .NET developer, but my technical repertoire is rather broader than they care to realize. When I dropped out of college, it was with both a working knowledge of UNIX and the sting of my ex-girlfriend's last kiss still lingering on my lips.</p>
<p>Not many geeks can make that boast; they might manage the former but not necessary the latter. I run Slackware and OpenBSD on secondhand computers at home, and build my website with basic UNIX tools. More on that later, since you're curious about my tech stack. I've been on the periphery of various FOSS projects for years; I used to be active on the FreeBSD mailing list between 2002 and 2004 and used to answer a lot of questions about setting up dial-up connections using <code>wvdial</code>. I had also dabbled a bit with Gemini Protocol in 2020 and 2021, to the point of running my own server at tanelorn.city. I'm also part of the reason that <a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~adnano/gemini/%3C20200613053926.GH11281%40brevard.conman.org%3E#%3C20200613022323.46fd03f0ec8bd59ca6a5709b@matthewgraybosch.com%3E">Gemini's companion upload protocol is called "Titan"</a>.</p>
<p>I not only use GNU Emacs for programming at home, but for my writing. Speaking of which, I'm the author of the novels <em>Without Bloodshed</em> and <em>Silent Clarion</em>, as well as stories like "The Milgram Battery" and "Limited Liability". They're all part of the same post-apocalyptic metal hurlant science fantasy saga: <em>Starbreaker</em>. It's basically a pastiche on Michael Moorcock and a bunch of other sf and fantasy authors who aren't slavish imitators of J. R. R. Tolkien, though I do have a dark lord who wears white and already rules the world; he's a Silicon Valley Saruman and as cunning a linguist as his namesake. (Remember: what happens in Lothlorien stays in Lothlorien.) If you read my fiction, expect a strong undercurrent of the same sort of Romantic Satanism one finds in Byron, Shelley, and Goethe.</p>
<p>I'm also autistic, but wasn't diagnosed until I was in my early 40s. Being like that has made my life harder than it might ordinarily be; I can be sociable, friendly, or even charming with effort — but even doing the minimum to seem normal in an office setting can leave me drained at the end of a workday. Despite this, I managed to meet a woman online in 2000 and court her for four years before marrying her in 2004; it'll have been 20 years for Catherine and me this Halloween.</p>
<p>I haven't always had the means to make a huge fuss over her for our anniversaries, but we did spend her 40th birthday in Paris, where I did the talking for both of us because I had just enough French to order at shops and restaurants and make basic polite conversation without immediately revealing myself as an Ugly American. It was more than she had, though. <em>Mais non, je ne parle et lire pas Francais bien.</em> But my French is better than my German, which is barely good enough to make sense of Rammstein lyrics.</p>
<p>I've got a couple of cats curled up beside me while I'm writing this, and the neighborhood strays know me for a soft touch. I'm a typical middle-aged American man in that I don't have any friends beside my wife, and I had to get by as a child and a young man without a lot of support, but the life I live is mostly the life I wanted for myself in my youth and I've done most of what I had wanted to do. I've written and published novels, I've traveled a bit, I live in a library, and my wife and I still enjoy each other's company. I'm doing pretty well for myself.</p>
<p>(Fair warning: if my introduction seemed like too much, it only gets worse from here.)</p>
<h2>What's the story behind your blog?</h2>
<p>I can't remember ever not having some kind of website after I first got internet access through my college's computer lab back in 1996. I've always dabbled in writing about my life online and sharing bits and pieces of my fiction online. The internet was always a place where I could geek out in a way I never felt safe enough to do in "real life". Even though I wasn't diagnosed as autistic until I was about 41, my parents had taught me to keep a low profile, not show off what I knew, and not bore other people with my interests.</p>
<p>On my websites I wasn't obligated to play by those rules, so I didn't. I didn't even have to be myself online. Instead, I could call myself "Mabelode the Faceless" in the time-honored tradition of wannabe hackers adopting grandiose pseudonyms. Of course, I'm still doing that, but taking inspiration from a Judas Priest song instead of a Michael Moorcock novel.</p>
<p>For about a decade I ran a website under my real name at <a href="https://matthewgraybosch.com/">matthewgraybosch.com</a>, because posting fiction on Google+ had gotten me a book deal with an independent press and I needed a website to promote myself if I wasn't to be wholly dependent on parasocial media like Google+, Facebook, and Twitter. If I had been a bit smarter at the time, I would have registered <a href="https://starbreaker.org/">starbreaker.org</a> in 2013 instead of 2020 and never used my real name. Though if I had really been smart, I would not have let starbreaker.net go, which I had held from about 2000 to 2006.</p>
<p>I still have a website on <a href="https://matthewgraybosch.com/">matthewgraybosch.com</a>, but it's mainly a substitute for having a LinkedIn account because LinkedIn has always been the Ashley Madison of job hunting, only more cultish. I mean, have you seen the people posting there? It's like the Stepford Wives got equally robotic husbands and they all got corporate jobs.</p>
<p>Some would argue that my clinging to a personal website instead of "getting with the program" and doing social media or a podcast or video is pointless. However, the pointlessness is the point. It's rather like my science fantasy writing: a sacrament of defiance. I feel as though the world only values me (and men in general (and don't even get me started on the way women are still objectified; Elon Musk in particular reminds me of Immortan Joe from <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em>)) for my ability to further enrich the already wealthy. My saving the best of my effort and paltry intellect for a website or fiction that benefits nobody but merely amuses me is the sort of gentle rebellion that keeps me alive. Without it I'd have killed myself decades ago, because a life lived solely for the sake of others isn't a life at all, but a life sentence.</p>
<p>On a lighter note, it's helped me with dating, too. All of the women I've dated, I met online. It wasn't my face or physique that interested them, but my writing. One of them is my wife of twenty years. The possibility that she might read something I've posted online keeps me from being entirely unreasonable.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I'm just another opinionated guy who happens to be capable of running his own website, so I do. If I had more musical talent and better social skills, I might be playing in a heavy metal band on nights and weekends instead.</p>
<p>Instead, I have <a href="https://starbreaker.org/">starbreaker.org</a>, where I let my hair down and speak my mind straight from the heart. My opinions aren't necessarily palatable; I'm generally irreligious, anti-capitalist, and anti-authoritarian. I provide the usual disclaimers, but it should be obvious that I'm not speaking for my employers there, or their partners and clients. Besides, if somebody doesn't want to hire me because I play the edgelord on a personal website then they don't deserve to have my name on their payroll in the first place; they're not a <em>culture fit</em> for me because they think they have the right to expect me to put aside basic human rights like freedom of expression even when I'm not on the clock.</p>
<h2>What does your creative process look like when it comes to blogging?</h2>
<p>Wifi off, headphones on. Beyond that, it depends. Sometimes I know what I want to write and have most of it roughed out in my head before my fingertips touch the keyboard because it's been in the background of my mind like a daemon process. Sometimes I'm feeling my way through, exploring an idea, smacking it around like my cat with a hollow ball that dispenses a little kibble if he can get it to roll the right way.</p>
<p>And sometimes, I'm just angry — usually about real-world bullshit that a sensible person would dismiss as somebody else's problem because they don't have the power and authority to take meaningful action. I, however, am not a sensible person. (My wife is looking over my shoulder and saying, "Thank God", incidentally.)</p>
<p>Hemingway supposedly wrote a lot of his best work while drunk. I'd like to think I've managed a few epic rants while somewhere between high dudgeon and Shakespearean wrath. There's a trope in Japanese role-playing games which suggests that you can solve the world's problems by finding the right white-haired pretty-boy and beating the crap out of him, but the real-world has a surplus of problems and a marked shortage of atomic blond Adonises on whom the world's problems can be blamed. Besides, I've more experience with a pen than a sword, and I'm a middle-aged adult besides, so I use my words.</p>
<p>Ultimately, my creative process — such as it is — is often just me asking myself how I can go about leaving the world a few scars by which to remember me without hurting innocent people in the process. I am ultimately shouting at the void, daring it to shout back as the abyss might in a Nietzschean staring contest. And sometimes it does, too.</p>
<p>For example, last year I wrote a rant after reading a post by Jake Seliger in which he outlined his regrets, because most of them annoyed me; they sounded like the scoldings of would-be Jordan Petersen who thinks he knows something about the world because he's made a few mistakes. One of them, which he suggested was not widely applicable, was in my opinion the only one that mattered. He didn't see a doctor the moment he noticed that something was weird about his tongue. If he had, he might not have lost it to cancer. If he had, he might not be slowly dying.</p>
<p>A couple of months later, I got an email from a woman whom discretion forbids me to name. She went to the doctor after putting it off for months because she had read my rant. Turns out she's got cancer, too. I never heard from her again. I hope she made it, but I'll never know. All I know is that if she did make it, but never felt the need to write to me again, I might still have saved somebody's life.</p>
<h2>Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe the physical space influences your creativity?</h2>
<p>If I have an ideal creative environment, I haven't found it yet. I've written at food courts in crowded shopping malls while my wife went shopping. I've written in an overpriced apartment with thin walls while my neighbors had a domestic dispute (after calling the police). I've written in my bedroom as a young man while my parents screamed at each other over money. I've written in the break room at my day job. I've written in bed, unable to sleep, and in my home office while listening in on a conference call that should have been an email.</p>
<p>I'm not joking about any of this. I wrote one novel, <a href="https://starbreaker.org/fiction/novels/without-bloodshed/index.html"><em>Without Bloodshed</em></a>, 1000 words at a time while hiding in a pizza parlor near my office. I'd get a slice, write part of a scene, and go back to work. I finished the first draft in about 100 days of writing in this fashion. I worked on <a href="https://starbreaker.org/fiction/novels/silent-clarion/index.html"><em>Silent Clarion</em></a> while working the night shift, babysitting a server farm. Did a lot of blogging that year, too, but I haven't gotten around to digging those posts out of the archive.</p>
<p>Rather than waiting or searching for the right environment in which to write, I made do with what I had; Virginia Woolf might have needed a room of her own, but there were times when I didn't even have that. Instead, I counted myself lucky if my parents weren't at my door giving me grief for being at home writing instead of going out and trying to meet girls. Never mind that what little money I made from my part time job went toward college expenses (or maintenance on my bicycle) so I had no money for dating, let alone the time or inclination.</p>
<p>I've found that it isn't so much the physical space that affects my creativity, but the playlist. The wrong music can make achieving a flow state impossible, but the right music can make me all but unstoppable. A playlist has to have music complex enough to engage my brain and keep me from noticing the world around me, but not so complex that I focus more on the music than the task I've set myself. Also, when writing fiction, the music needs to match the character.</p>
<p>For example, I've had good sessions with albums by the Blue Öyster Cult, Queensrÿche, Therion, Hiromi Uehara, Thank You Scientist, Braindance, Galneryus, The Sisters of Mercy, Threshold, Savatage, Judas Priest, Ghost, Paradise Lost, and Iron Maiden. I've had terrible sessions with albums by Frank Zappa, even though he's an old favorite. Likewise King Crimson, Mahavishnu Orchestra, Steve Vai, Devin Townshend, Coheed and Cambria, Baroness, and Titans to Tachyons — all of whom have released excellent albums that just don't make for good writing music because they demand the listener's active attention.</p>
<p>The importance of having the right album playing doesn't apply solely to blogging, incidentally. It applies to my fiction writing and to my day job as a developer. All of these roles require that I be able to quickly and reliably access a flow state.</p>
<p>There's also the matter of tooling. I don't spend quite so much time in GNU Emacs that I use it to read and compose email, but that's mainly because setting up Emacs to interface with an IMAP-based provider is a pain in the ass and Fastmail's web interface is <em>good enough</em> that I'd rather not bother. Emacs has, however, become indispensable to me for writing in a way few other applications have. It is for me what Scrivener is for a lot of novelists, and it integrates with other tools in a way few writing tools can match. Those that can generally trace their descent to Bill Joy's vi editor.</p>
<h2>A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your tech stack?</h2>
<p>I doubt your more technical readers would find my stack particularly impressive, but everything's in <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~starbreaker/starbreaker.org">my site's git repository</a>, which is publicly accessible on Sourcehut.</p>
<p>I usually have "Rube Goldberg Variations" by Thank You Scientist on repeat when working on my tooling, incidentally. The title seemed fitting.</p>
<p>My host is Nearly Free Speech, and my website is served by Apache on FreeBSD. It's all static HTML pages with a little CSS (as a treat) so there's no database involved and no need for a server-side programming language or framework like PHP or Ruby on Rails, let alone the C# and ASP.NET I use at my day job.</p>
<p>Nor is there any JavaScript, let alone front-end frameworks like Bootstrap. It simply isn't needed for a personal website in my opinion, especially not with all the functionality that gets built into HTML5 and CSS3. I'm not one of those developers building their blog with Node.js and Astro or Eleventy, for example, let alone React. I don't even use a static site generator like Jekyll or Hugo, though I've tried both.</p>
<p>I write for my website in HTML with GNU Emacs on an old, secondhand computer running Slackware, and I compile Emacs myself to have the latest version. I used to use Markdown or Org Mode and convert to HTML with pandoc, but that gets slow once you've got a couple hundred posts in your archive (not to mention a few novels). Each page's metadata is stored in a separate file as shell variables that I source from my build script.</p>
<p>I make use of templates and partials, but implement them using shell scripts and a makefile that I run locally instead of depending on a continuous integration (CI) system. My dependencies are limited to bash, GNU coreutils, sed, awk, m4, exiftool, libjxl, avifenc, cwebp, HTML tidy, and tools from the W3C's HTML-XML-utils suite. My idea of deploying a website is to type "make install", which calls rsync and pushes changes to my host over SSH. If I really wanted automatic builds and deployments, I could set up a cron job on my Slackware machine.</p>
<p>Aside from the support for WebP, AVIF, and JPEG XL image formats, my stack is something I might have used in 1999 if I knew then what I knew today. It's just a MEWNIX system. My cats know this.</p>
<figure class="m-o" data-template="with"><div class="m-m"><img class="img" loading="lazy" src="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/pb-matthew-graybosch/9c25d1967c-1717050282/battlestation.jpg" style="aspect-ratio:1000 / 1333"></div><figcaption>Smudge (bottom right) and Purrseus (top left) taking turns as sysadmins</figcaption></figure>
<p>(At risk of ruining a joke by explanation: MEWNIX is a weak pun on UNIX, which was in turn a weak pun on MULTICS.)</p>
<h2>Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would you do anything differently?</h2>
<p>The main reason I have a blog is that everybody and their cat seems to have one. I can't help but wonder if maybe blogging really did break the World Wide Web, as some posts I've read suggest.</p>
<p>I find that blogging requires a different sort of focus, and that I don't necessarily refer to old blog posts when writing new ones. When blogging, it is easy to ignore the past in favor of the eternal present. This often leads to me repeating myself, or at least paraphrasing myself, because each post is a discrete and timestamped snapshot of what I was thinking in the moment. It seems a format better suited to machines than people.</p>
<p>If I were starting from zero today, or could go back 20 years knowing what I know today, I wouldn't start a blog. I would rather have the online equivalent of a <a href="https://starbreaker.org/blog/personal/making-a-grimoire/index.html">commonplace book or a grimoire</a>, with a single page per major topic that just keeps growing as I add to it. If I have written about a particular subject, such as commentary on a particular novel or heavy metal album, I would rather expand upon or refine what I have already written than write something entirely new.</p>
<p>I understand that this is also called digital gardening. However, having an internet grimoire appeals more to my inner child, who is still a thirteen-year-old edgelord trying to shock his elders by appearing to dabble in diabolism.</p>
<p>At the very least, I would not want to do as much blogging as I currently do, but instead take an excerpt from my commonplace and either summarize or reformat it as a blog post — or use the blog to highlight changes and additions to my grimoire.</p>
<p>I also think that blogging doesn't encourage deep reading on the part of visitors. You might read a blog post because somebody shared a link somewhere, but not bother to dig deeper into that site's archive. Furthermore, blogging in retrospect seems a precursor to social media, especially after RSS feeds and feed aggregators had their 15 minutes. This approach made it easy to think in terms of being a "content creator" and thus commodifying personal expression.</p>
<p>It's bad enough I have to be a commodity, or human capital, at my day job. I don't want to be a commodity in my recreation as well.</p>
<h2>Financial question since the web is obsessed with money: how much does it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost or does it generate some revenue? And what's your position on people monetising personal blogs?</h2>
<p>I rent my domain for about $15/year. Dot org domains don't seem trendy, so they're generally cheap. I rent disk, CPU, and bandwidth from Nearly Free Speech for about $5/month on average, though that's dependent mainly on traffic. Hosting on Nearly Free Speech is relatively cheap because they charge extra for technical support if you aren't the sort who can read a FAQ and figure things out yourself.</p>
<p>I pay the expenses of running a website out of my salary from my day job instead of trying to make a side hustle out of it. This is, oddly enough, recreation and self-care for me. My website is my work done my way, and that's priceless.</p>
<p>Besides, I spend a lot less to run my website than I have on any of the following in a given year:</p>
<ul>
<li>Local, state, and Federal property, sales, income, and payroll taxes</li>
<li>Power</li>
<li>Heating</li>
<li>Water</li>
<li>Sewage</li>
<li>Garbage collection</li>
<li>Rent/Mortgage payments</li>
<li>Groceries</li>
<li>My subscription to <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> (aka multiplayer power fantasy with anime melodrama and a symphonic power metal soundtrack)</li>
<li>Books, movies, and music on physical media</li>
<li>Dates with my wife</li>
<li>Health insurance premiums</li>
<li>Residential internet access from a regional monopoly provider those TOS won't let me self-host HTTP or email</li>
<li>Streaming video subscriptions that have little of interest to watch</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm against monetizing personal websites, but nobody elected me to have an opinion on what other people do with their own websites — and they certainly aren't <em>paying</em> me to care. If you want to turn your website into a side hustle, or can make a full-time living off of affiliate links and making people pay for the privilege of posting comments, more power to you. I just can't be bothered to do any of that myself.</p>
<p>Memo to people monetizing their sites with ads: don't expect me to turn off my ad blocker for you. I don't do that for <em>anybody</em>, because all adtech is malware and uBlock Origin is the new Norton Antivirus. And if you get really annoying, I'll disable JavaScript for your domain, too. Why? For the same reason I write: because I can, because I choose to, and because you can't stop me. If ads on your website can't support your expenses, too bad: that's what having a day job is for.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I'm even rethinking my "screw AI" and "screw Google" stance; it had occurred to me that by <a href="https://starbreaker.org/robots.txt">blocking AI crawlers</a> I am forgoing an opportunity to throw a monkey wrench (or a spanner for the Brits reading this) into OpenAI's works by injecting my irreligious, anti-capitalist, and anti-authoritarian sentiments into their training data. It would be amusing of ChatGPT encouraged young workers to ask themselves what America has done for <em>them</em> lately because OpenAI slurped down my blog without anything resembling meaningful human oversight.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there's enough machine-generated slop on the internet without me indirectly contributing to it.</p>
<h2>Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth checking out? And also, who do you think I should be interviewing next?</h2>
<p>I was tempted to suggest that you take a look at my <a href="https://starbreaker.org/bookmarks/">links page</a> and pick websites to check out, but reorganizing that page (and adding more sites) has been on my to-do list for a while now.</p>
<p>I'll try to keep this simple: with one exception that I'll list first, if I mention a website here it's probably worthwhile to interview its operator as well.</p>
<p>The exception is Simone Silvestroni at <a href="https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/">Minutes to Midnight</a>, because not only have <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/pb-simone-silvestroni">you already thought of him</a> but he seems to have submitted his reply with greater alacrity than I've managed.</p>
<ul>
<li>I like <a href="https://silviamaggidesign.com/">Silvia Maggi's</a> website, whom Simone often mentions. I didn't know she and Simone were married until recently; I never asked because I figured it was none of my business.</li>
<li>I also like <a href="https://maya.land/">maya.land</a>, not least because its content warning both amuses me and allows me to indulge in self-flattery; because I can chuckle when I read it, it proves I can take a joke.</li>
<li>I don't think Brian Russ has a blog, but he's been running the <a href="http://www.bnrmetal.com/v5/main/home">BNR Metal Pages</a> since 1995. It was one of the first websites I ever visited when I first got onto the internet at a college computer lab in late 1996.</li>
<li><a href="https://so1o.xyz/">so1o</a> is an otaku and gamer out of Hong Kong. He <a href="https://so1o.xyz/blog/designing-in-the-open">builds his website from scratch</a>, and he's better at it than he thinks.</li>
<li><a href="https://lysianth.us/">Lysianthus</a> is another website operator who isn't much for blogging. I like her style, though.</li>
<li><a href="https://frills.dev/">Frills</a> is a web developer from Wales with some <a href="https://frills.dev/experiments/">fun experiments</a>. I've made a lot of use of her <a href="https://frills.dev/experiments/html-named-colors/">HTML Named Colors</a> tool.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.kradeelav.com/">Kradeelav</a> is fun if you're into villains or leather. She does a lot of fan art, but isn't suitable for children. I liked her zine <a href="https://kradeelav.itch.io/boxofdoom"><em>The Box of Doom</em></a> (and bought a paper copy).</li>
<li><a href="https://www.marginalia.nu/">Viktor Lofgren</a> runs his own <a href="https://search.marginalia.nu">search engine</a>. That alone should make him worth interviewing.</li>
<li><a href="https://darylsun.page/">Daryl Sun</a> is a Filipina gamer and otaku building her own website and blog.</li>
<li><a href="https://foreverliketh.is/">foreverliketh.is</a> is a teacher and digital gardener.</li>
<li><a href="https://melonland.net/">Melon</a> runs a smol web forum that's closed on Mondays (Irish time).</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.basementcommunity.com/">Orchids</a> runs another smol web forum called Basement Community.</li>
<li><a href="https://btxx.org/">Bradley Taunt</a> is into minimalist web design, shell scripting, and OpenBSD.</li>
<li><a href="https://xandra.cc">xandra</a> was active in Yesterweb and is currently one of the major personalities behind <a href="https://32bit.cafe">32bit Cafe</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://nightfall.city/nex/in/m15o/">m150</a> isn't really a blogger, but a hacker and sysadmin who runs little social sites like <a href="https://midnight.pub">The Midnight Pub</a> and <a href="https://nightfall.city">Nightfall City</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://dataswamp.org/~solene/index.html">Solène Rapenne</a> is an OpenBSD developer and blogger who wrote her own static site generator in <a href="https://lisp-lang.org/">Common Lisp</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://tarabrenn.neocities.org/">Tara Brennan</a> is new to having a personal website, but if she keeps at it I think she'll have an interesting blog.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Final question: is there anything you want to share with us?</h2>
<p>Oh, there's quite a bit I could share, and not all of it mine, but I'll get to the self-promotion in due course.</p>
<h3>Books</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Circe</em> by Madeline Miller retells the myths surrounding the sorceress who first proved an obstacle to Odysseus before becoming an ally, giving her a depth of character not readily apparent in the source material. I had written at some length about her first novel, <a href="https://starbreaker.org/blog/entertainment/song-of-achilles/index.html"><em>The Song of Achilles</em></a>, too.</li>
<li><em>A Thousand Ships</em> and <em>Stone Blind</em> by Natalie Haynes are more retellings of classic myths by a feminist classical scholar; Haynes also hosts "Natalie Haynes Stands Up for the Classics" for BBC Radio 4.</li>
<li>I am still reading Emily Wilson's translation of Homer's <em>Iliad</em>; my wife had given me the hardcover for Christmas. When I'm done I'll read her translation of the <em>Odyssey</em>, and I wonder what she'd make of Virgil's <em>Aeneid</em>.</li>
<li>I have at the top of one of my "read next" piles a copy of <em>Inanna</em> by Emily H. Wilson, no relation to the aforementioned translator of Homer. This novel deals with Sumerian myth, and includes a rather more down-to-earth depiction of Gilgamesh.</li>
<li>If retellings of ancient epics aren't your style, I'd like to recommend <a href="https://www.ljcohen.net/">L. J. Cohen's</a> space operas, starting with <a href="https://starbreaker.org/blog/entertainment/lj-cohen-derelict-worthy-heinlein/index.html"><em>Derelict</em></a>.</li>
<li>Sally Wiener Grotta has four feminist sf stories worthy of <a href="https://starbreaker.org/blog/entertainment/catherine-lucille-moore-queen-pulps/index.html">C. L. Moore</a> in her latest collection, <a href="https://www.sallywienergrotta.com/of-being-woman/"><em>Of Being Woman</em></a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Music</h3>
<p>I had been listening to some of the following while working on this post (and other things):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://nuclearpowertrio.bandcamp.com/album/a-clear-and-present-rager"><em>A Clear and Present Rager</em></a> and <a href="https://nuclearpowertrio.bandcamp.com/album/wet-ass-plutonium"><em>Wet Ass Plutonium</em></a> by the Nuclear Power Trio remind me of Liquid Tension Experiment on a Latin jazz kick, but with more puns and tongues wedged firmly in cheeks hidden by dictator masks.</li>
<li>Oddly enough for band that seems to mainly do jazz/synthwave fusion, I discovered Cloud People's <a href="https://cloudpeople1.bandcamp.com/album/simulacra"><em>Simulacra</em></a> album via a review on <a href="https://www.angrymetalguy.com/cloud-people-simulacra-review/">Angry Metal Guy</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://emberbelladonna.bandcamp.com/album/the-grove"><em>The Grove</em></a> by Ember Belladonna is folk metal with a flute as lead instrument, but flautist Emma Kramer-Rodger doesn't play like she's auditioning for a Jethro Tull revival band, and thank Arioch for that.</li>
<li>NYC's Braindance calls the music they do <a href="http://progressivedarkwave.com/brainbio.html">"progressive darkwave"</a>. It kinda reminds me of Type O Negative, but with more guitar shredding courtesy of axe witch Vora Vor. Whenever I put on their <em>Redemption</em> album from 2002, I settle into a groove, but I think I still have the promo tape I got from them while waiting to get into a show at the long-gone Roseland Ballroom in Manhattan back in 1995. And their website is a throwback to turn-of-the-century web design.</li>
</ul>
<h3>My Stuff</h3>
<p>I've got a fairly sizable archive of posts on my website, but I provide a <a href="https://starbreaker.org/blog/recommended.html">recommended page</a> as a starting point. It has web manifestos like "Party Like It's 1989" and "This Is Not My Side Hustle" along with rants like "Literature Ain't Burger King" and "Storming Heaven". Basically, something to offend everyone.</p>
<p>There's also <a href="https://starbreaker.org/fiction/index.html">my fiction</a>. After the rights to the fiction I had published with <a href="https://writerbeware.blog/2018/04/25/author-complaints-mount-at-curiosity-quills-press/">Curiosity Quills Press</a> reverted to me around 2020, I ended up putting it all on my website. Good thing, too, because my first novel <a href="https://starbreaker.org/fiction/novels/without-bloodshed/index.html"><em>Without Bloodshed</em></a> (2013) is long out of print, and my second novel <a href="https://starbreaker.org/fiction/novels/silent-clarion/index.html"><em>Silent Clarion</em></a> never got a print edition in the first place.</p>
<p>(For people interested in web development, I manage to publish both of these novels as a single page while using less data than a typical post on either Twitter, Bluesky, or Mastodon. My secret: no JavaScript, and no frameworks — just raw HTML with a little CSS.)</p>
<p>Both novels, as well as my <a href="https://starbreaker.org/fiction/stories/index.html">short stories</a> and <a href="https://starbreaker.org/fiction/index.html">other unfinished/abandoned work</a>, are pastiches of <em>Final Fantasy</em>, Michael Moorcock, and lyrics from Blue Öyster Cult and Judas Priest. My fiction page makes no secret of my influences, and you can also read <em>Silent Clarion</em> as a mostly-affectionate parody of urban fantasy and paranormal romances by the likes of Laurell K. Hamilton, Patricia Briggs, and Kim Harrison.</p>
<p>If you've ever decided against sharing something like <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com">Motherfucking Website</a> at work because of the profanity (or find it too Oedipal), I've got you covered. <a href="https://actualwebsite.org/">This is an Actual Website</a>.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, I have a somewhat more professional website at <a href="https://matthewgraybosch.com/">matthewgraybosch.com</a>. At least, I'm not using nearly as much profanity there, but I still claim to be a "full-stack thaumaturge" there. I'm also looking for a better job, so if anybody knows somebody looking to hire an experienced generalist techie with a patchwork DIY liberal arts education, please send them my way.</p>
<p>In closing, and to paraphrase what I say in party chat after a dungeon crawl or boss fight in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>: <strong>thanks for having me!</strong></p>

## Genesis

date: 2024-05-31, from: Ayjay blog

I was disappointed by Marilynne Robinson’s Reading Genesis, though that may have less to do with the quality of Robinson’s book than with my way of thinking about the Bible. Robinson proceeds by a kind of Lockean association of ideas: on one (typical) page a thought about Joseph and his brothers reminds her Adam and [&#8230;]

## What We Learned from a Year of Building with LLMs (Part II)

date: 2024-05-31, from: O'Reilly Radar

A possibly apocryphal quote attributed to many leaders reads: “Amateurs talk strategy and tactics. Professionals talk operations.” Where the tactical perspective sees a thicket of&#160;sui generis&#160;problems, the operational perspective sees a pattern of organizational dysfunction to repair. Where the strategic perspective sees an opportunity, the operational perspective sees a challenge worth rising to. In part [&#8230;]

## First, and possibly only, look at Dell’s weird version of FreeBSD: ThinOS

date: 2024-05-30, from: OS News

About a week ago I reported on a case study from Dell and FreeBSD, about Dell&#8217;s ThinOS thin client operating system, which basically consists of a proprietary Dell GUI running on top of, at the moment, FreeBSD 12 (they&#8217;re moving to FreeBSD 14 for the next ThinOS release). Well, this got me interested &#8211; I&#8217;ve always been fascinated by thin clients, and a Dell/Wyse FreeBSD &#8216;distribution&#8217; is just wild enough to be interesting &#8211; so I went onto eBay, and bought a Dell thin client. More specifically, I bought a Dell OptiPlex 3000 Thin Client, which comes with an Intel Pentium Silver N6005, a four core CPU without hyperthreading, 16 GB of RAM, a 32GB eMMC storage chip with room for a small M.2 SSD, WiFi 6, Ethernet, USB 3.0, 2.0, and C ports, Bluetooth, and so on. A low-power, but still quite capable little computer that I snagged for a mere €130, which is a steal compared to the full unit price; my configuration is sold new for like €700-800. Of course, these things are sold in batches of hundreds or maybe even thousands of units, and in such volumes corporate clients get massive discounts. Still, it&#8217;s a nice deal. My model came installed with Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, which I was not at all interested in. I immediately downloaded the latest ThinOS version for my model, used Dell&#8217;s tool and instructions to create a bootable USB, and got to work. The installation process was quick and easy, and does indeed look like an automated FreeBSD installation, TUI and all. After the installation is completed, you get guided through a first-run experience to configure things like the keyboard, WiFi, and so on, and it looks rather fancy. Once I completed the first-run experience, I hit the roadblock I was expecting: in order to use ThinOS, you need a ThinOS Activation License. Since my device was originally sold with (I think) Ubuntu preinstalled, it doesn&#8217;t have a TAL in its UEFI, and the only way to push a TAL to a device is to use the Dell Wyse Management Suite. Sadly, the Dell WMS only runs on Windows, and to make matters far worse, only on Windows Server. And it gets even worse &#8211; even if I created a Windows Server VM just to run WMS, I need the Pro version, which isn&#8217;t free (the free Standard version cannot push TALs), and I&#8217;d need to buy a TAL. Aside from the Windows Server restriction, I was aware of these limitations and requirements, so I&#8217;m not in the least bit surprised. I was curious to see if buying a TAL was an easy experience, or if it&#8217;s entirely geared towards enterprise customers and silly hobbyists like me need not apply. Without a license, I can use the proprietary Dell user interface, but it seems I can&#8217;t connect to any possible VDI providers, and I can&#8217;t tell what other features might be gated at the moment. With some admittedly very mild poking and prodding, I also haven&#8217;t been able to discover any ways of &#8216;leaving&#8217; Dell&#8217;s proprietary GUI to get to a terminal. I&#8217;ll do some more prodding over the coming days. I&#8217;m not entirely sure where to go from here when it comes to seeing just how much you can do with ThinOS, which was my original goal for this project. I have a feeling the pro version of the Dell Wyse Management Suite is going to be rather expensive &#8211; I can&#8217;t find any pricing information, which confirms my suspicions &#8211; so I think the journey ends here. Unless any OSNews readers have experience with this stuff, and can point me to some tips and tricks to perhaps acquire and install a TAL some other way, there won&#8217;t be a more in-depth look at Dell&#8217;s weird version of FreeBSD on OSNews. Which sucks, but was to be expected when it comes to enterprise software. Mind you, this does not mean the hardware is going to waste. Not only are there other purpose-built thin client operating systems to experiment with, it is also a full-fledged tiny x86 computer with completely silent passive cooling and a free M.2 slot, so the possibilities are endless.

## clichés, yes or no

date: 2024-05-30, from: Ayjay blog

Amanda Montell: Since the moment I learned about the concept of the “thought-terminating cliche” I’ve been seeing them everywhere I look: in televised political debates, in flouncily stencilled motivational posters, in the hashtag wisdom that clogs my social media feeds. Coined in 1961 by psychiatrist Robert Jay Lifton, the phrase describes a catchy platitude aimed [&#8230;]

## Testing object detection (yolo, mobilenet, etc.) with picamera2 on Pi 5

## Webb Spots a Starburst

date: 2024-05-30, from: NASA breaking news

The James Webb Space Telescope observed “starburst” galaxy NGC 4449, seen in this image released on May 29, 2024. Starbursts are intense periods of star formation usually concentrated at a galaxy’s core, but NGC 4449’s activity is much more widespread — likely due to past interactions with its galactic neighbors. Astronomers can study this galaxy [&#8230;]

## Biden: Why isn't Trump in jail?

date: 2024-05-30, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Biden would be a fine president if our problems were limited to the virus, the economy and climate change. </p>
<p>He's like Obama, but with much more experience at getting things done in Washington. </p>
<p>His failure is that the fascist movement in the country is much stronger now than it was when he took office. </p>
<p>Are we better off than we were four years ago? No, sadly we are worse off. Trump is a much bigger threat now.</p>
<p>Biden is a fine LBJ-like president. And like LBJ, he has his Vietnam. Biden's war he can't end is called Trump. Trump isn't in jail. That's the failure right there. </p>
<p>The problem could be fixed if we had this discussion out in the open, so that the press raises it every day and in every press event. They shouldn't be trying to embarrass him about his age, that's rude and deceptive, instead they should ask why isn't Trump in jail?</p>
<p>If Biden wanted to address this, and it would certainly help his chances of winning, he would:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fire Garland immediately.</li>
<li>Apologize for not firing him sooner. It was a mistake. My mistake. I own it. I am sorry.</li>
<li>Nominate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Raskin">Jamie Raskin</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liz_Cheney">Liz Cheney</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruben_Gallego">Ruben Gallego</a> as the new AG.   </li>
<li>Biden's number one promise is that he will <i>fully</i> prosecute Trump and all insurrectionists in his second term, starting now. This would also serve as a warning to any Trump supporters that tried to overthrow the government (again, sigh) before or during the election. </li>
</ul>
<p>Trump is making a fool of Biden by saying openly that he will be a dictator on Day 1.</p>
<p>People who think Trump is losing don't get it. People are rightly fed up with Biden. But not for the economy. That's bullshit. And not because he's old. Rather because he's selling us out, just hoping against hope that the voters will save us. It's kind of unreasonable to expect that when you, the person we elected president to get us out of this hole, didn't fire the biggest obstacle to our starting to dig. </p>
<p>Depend on Congress, the press, the courts, now the voters. </p>
<p>No Biden, you're the president. This is <i>your</i> job. </p>

## 2024-05-23 Death and dying

date: 2024-05-30, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-05-23-death-and-dying">2024-05-23 Death and dying</h1>

<p>This is the first time somebody is dying in my close family where I am old enough to be an adult about it.</p>

<p>One of my sisters died when I was about twenty. I was living in Switzerland with my dad, and it was terrible to hear my mom crying at the phone, practically unable to tell me what had happened, to then see my father confused, shocked. I booked a flight for him but didn&rsquo;t go myself. My mom was living in Portugal with my two sisters. I wasn&rsquo;t there for my sister&rsquo;s burial. People had to be buried within 48 hours, back then. I don&rsquo;t know how things are now. There was school and stuff and I had not lived with my sisters for a few years. I didn&rsquo;t feel very close. It just felt weird. I didn&rsquo;t know what it was supposed to mean.</p>

<p>Now, thirty years later, my stepfather is dying. His kidneys are failing, his liver is failing, his lungs are filling up with water, his heart is failing; they can&rsquo;t give him his heart medication because the kidneys are at their limits, can&rsquo;t have him move around because he&rsquo;s weak, and so he&rsquo;s breaking down. I mean, he&rsquo;s calm, he knows what&rsquo;s happening, and he&rsquo;s very, very tired. He&rsquo;s ready to go.</p>

<p>I think that in my heart, I know that this is how it works. We have to go one day. I don&rsquo;t want to spend the last hours hooked up to machines. I&rsquo;ll be very, very tired. I&rsquo;ll just want to go home. I also won&rsquo;t want anybody around me to be sad. Hopefully, I&rsquo;ll feel that I lived a good life, that I had a good time, that the people I spend my time with were decent people, worthy of the short time I was given. I hope that I will be able to let go and be at peace. It&rsquo;s what I hear about my stepfather.</p>

<p>But when I sit in that family video call, with siblings in Portugal and Germany and my, and my mother, and one after another people start crying, choking up, it&rsquo;s hard. It&rsquo;s a that invisible choker, grabbing us, one after another.</p>

<p>I need to remember the good times, the conversations we had, the laughter we shared. I need to book a flight and see the rest of our family. All that independence and all that living abroad is coming back to haunt us, now.</p>

<p>To go and support each other.</p>

<p>Go and hug your loved ones.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Family">#Family</a></p>

<p><strong>2024-05-27</strong>. I arrived today. He didn’t look good at all. In fact, he seemed to be barely holding on to life. Sleeping, mostly. Occasionally, gasping for air, staring, maybe recognizing us, saying a word or two. It was heartbreaking. He died the same day. The doctor and the nurse came, two very friendly people. Removed the tubes, stopped the Morphium machine, made his death official.</p>

<p>There were so many tears. A step brother, a half-brother, a half-sister, my sister, my half-brother’s wife, their kid, my mom… the kid was the only one that seemed unperturbed. “Don’t be sad, grandma!”</p>

<p>Later the funerary services came to pick up the body. Again, both of them super nice. We’ll see how things go, tomorrow. My mother is not feeling well. I seem to be doing OK. I can be strong when it’s not my partner that has died.</p>

<p>I’m happy we were all there for him, singing songs, bringing him his birthday cake (he died on his 78th birthday). I’m happy we were all there for each other.</p>

<p><strong>2024-05-28</strong>. Cremation today. The sun is out. People on the radio.</p>

<p><strong>2024-05-30</strong>. On the way home. It was good to see the family again. I gave a little speech in Portuguese, explaining how the language continues to remain important to us, even if we live a abroad, and how hard it was for a family where people live in different countries, alone – but also how our parents divorcing and marrying had led to an ever growing family. There are more parents, more siblings, and I love it and it helps. We can all help each other. And my deceased stepfather was certainly an enrichment for our family, bringing anarchy and lawlessness and laughter into a family that was rigid and regimented and dour, and how we all grew with that and how it was important to remember the good times we had and the lessens we all drew from his presence. Truly, a great influence for all of us.</p>

<p>I still remember how I met him years before my mother met him. He lived across the river alone with his son, wild and free and I was so jealous. I wished to love like that! And then my parents divorced, my dad went back to Switzerland and a year later I followed him and got to live wild and free like them, it was amazing. And one day I came back and there were rumors that our mother had found a boyfriend. Imagine my surprise when it was him! The wild and free guitar playing dude from across the river! And eventually my friend from school turned into my stepbrother, moved in with my mom, lived in my room. It was mysterious and magical and then to see him and his father struggle with my mom, the changes they brought about, it was a miracle.</p>

<p>So, my man, wherever you are, here‘s to you and your last trip, to your guitars and flutes, your love of music and freedom, your spirit of independence and love of people and aliens. Cheers! I hope to see you again.</p>

The best humor is about other people being stupid, evil, clumsy or their misfortune. Watch a SNL skit. It's not about people being smart or brave, kind, generous or otherwise wonderful. That's another kind of entertainment. We find the misfortune of others funny. Especially famous, successful people. Why? I have no idea.

## Help identify these obscure operating systems and vendors

date: 2024-05-30, from: OS News

Over on the GNU config-patches mailing list, Zack Weinberg is looking for help identifying a number of ancient operating systems and vendors. These are probably all either vendor or OS names from the late 1980s or early 1990s. Can anyone help me fill out the following list of things that ought to appear in testsuite/config-sub.data, if I knew what to put in place of the question marks? ???-pc533 ???-pc533-??????-sim ???-sim-??????-ultra ???-ultra-??????-unicom ???-unicom-??????-acis ???-???-aos???-triton ???-???-sysv3???-oss ???-???-sysv3???-storm-chaos ???-???-??? ↫ Zack Weinberg One of them has already been identified &#8211; &#8220;storm-chaos&#8221; turns out to have been added to binutils and/or maybe GCC in 2000, and after some digging around, John Marshall found what it&#8217;s referring to: chaos, a hobby operating system for x86 written in C. It has a long history, and after a period of inactivity came back in 2015 with a new website. Some new releases followed, with the last one being version 0.3.0 in 2019. It&#8217;s been silence since then. The others are still up for grabs to be discovered. There is some talk that the pc533 one might be a misspelling of pc532, which would refer to the &#8220;NS32K-based PC532 board running NetBSD&#8221;. This is an incredibly obscure complete system built around the NS32532, of which only around 150 were built in the early &#8217;90s. However, Weinberg is hesitant to accept this theory without more information, since there is already code to handle the pc532, and he wants to be sure before making any changes. If there is one place on the internet outside of the GNU mailing lists that might be able to help Weinberg, it&#8217;s the OSNews audience. We have so many older people reading OSNews who have been working or otherwise active in this field for many decades, and I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if these cryptic names make some bells ring for some of you. If one of you does e-mail a reply, be sure to mention this article &#8211; organic marketing to help keep us going!

## AI and the English language

date: 2024-05-30, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>I was going through my morning routine of checking emails and various forums and chats, when I stumbled on <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@eleventy/112526068812208213">this post on mastodon</a>.</p>
<p>Not going to comment on the stupidity of the suggestion itself but it got me wondering if the fact that most of the web is English-based is going to be both a blessing and a curse for these AI. There is just so much nonsense written in English online, maybe a lot more as a % compared to the other languages.</p>
<p>I very much look forward to reading some studies done by someone smarter than me in the future. It's a fascinating topic.</p>                <hr>

It's not like a batting average or a weather forecast. It's not something that can be measured objectively. Art is the response that it evokes in the observer. It's art when people say "that's not art." And when someone says only human professionals create art, if he really believes that, he has no freaking clue what art is.

## Spaceflight affects tumor-bearing fruit fly hosts and their parasites

date: 2024-05-29, from: NASA breaking news

How does spaceflight affect tumor-bearing fruit fly hosts and their parasites? Background: Like humans, fruit flies (a model organism for spaceflight research) also exhibit immune system dysfunction in space. Despite decades of studies on fruit flies and wasps, little was known about how their immune systems interact with natural parasites in space.&#160;Drosophila&#160;parasitoid&#160;wasps modify blood cell [&#8230;]

## Google is killing off the messaging service inside Google Maps

date: 2024-05-29, from: OS News

Google is killing off a messaging service! This one is the odd &#8220;Google Business Messaging&#8221; service—basically an instant messaging client that is built into Google Maps. If you looked up a participating business in Google Maps or Google Search on a phone, the main row of buttons in the place card would read something like &#8220;Call,&#8221; &#8220;Chat,&#8221; &#8220;Directions,&#8221; and &#8220;Website.&#8221; That &#8220;Chat&#8221; button is the service we&#8217;re talking about. It would launch a full messaging interface inside the Google Maps app, and businesses were expected to use it for customer service purposes. Google&#8217;s deeply dysfunctional messaging strategy might lead people to joke about a theoretical &#8220;Google Maps Messaging&#8221; service, but it already exists and has existed for years, and now it&#8217;s being shut down. ↫ Ron Amadeo at Ars Technica When it comes to Google, it&#8217;s often hard to distinguish meme from reality.

## A Fun AI Fail

date: 2024-05-29, from: Doc Searls (at Harvard), New Old Blog

Here is me, trying to get ChatGPT (version 4o, which I pay for) to give me an illustration to use in my last post here, titled The People&#8217;s AI. But don&#8217;t go there yet (if you haven&#8217;t already). What I ended up using there is a punchline at the end of the dialog that starts [&#8230;]

## Vox Media and The Atlantic sign content deals with OpenAI

date: 2024-05-29, from: OS News

Speaking of The Verge, its parent company Vox Media, along with The Atlantic, have signed a deal with OpenAI. Two more media companies have signed licensing agreements with OpenAI, allowing their content to be used to train its AI models and be shared inside of ChatGPT. The Atlantic and Vox Media — The Verge’s parent company — both announced deals with OpenAI on Wednesday. ↫ Emilia David at The Verge In the case of Vox Media, the deal was made and announced without informing their staff, which obviously doesn&#8217;t sit well with especially Vox&#8217; writers. By making deals like this, upper management gets to double-dip on the fruits of their workers&#8217; labour &#8211; first, the published content generates ad revenues, and second, OpenAI pays them to use said content for training and other purposes. And once the &#8220;AI&#8221; gets good enough, more and more of the writers will be fired, leaving only a skeleton crew of lower-paid workers to clean up the &#8220;AI&#8221; output. With this deal, the writing is on the wall for every journalist at Vox Media &#8211; you&#8217;re currently contributing to your own obsolescence, and your bosses are getting paid for it. As far as I know, OSNews&#8217; owner, David, has not yet been contacted by OpenAI. Regardless, I&#8217;ll sell the past 20-odd years of my terrible takes for 69 million euros, after deducting Swedish taxes. And since OpenAI is run by billionaires: taxes are this thing where normal people pay a portion of their income to the government in return for various government services. It&#8217;s wild, I know.

## Technical writing is not a dead-end job, it's a landing pad

date: 2024-05-29, from: Blog by Fabrizio Ferri-Benedetti

With the job market getting tougher by the day, there&rsquo;s a rising belief among tech writers that their role is &ldquo;too niche&rdquo; and a &ldquo;dead-end job&rdquo;. I think that&rsquo;s the wrong way of looking at our profession — at any profession. Let me cast aside that dark veil of pessimism and offer an alternative viewpoint, that of tech writing as a platform to other professions, one that lets you move laterally with just a bit of curiosity and courage.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-05-29, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

How can we tell if ChatGPT is intelligent? How can I tell if you're intelligent. How do I know I'm intelligent. It could be my "intelligence" is as algorithmic as ChatGPT's. It could be that my intelligence is only a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-preservation">survival mechanism</a>, and the only way I could think of something I think is intelligent is if it furthers my chance to reproduce. But what happens when our intellect instructs us to destroy the environment we depend on for life? It could be we are already obsolete, without the robots, it sure feels that way, and that our only <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah%27s_Ark">ark</a> that could lead us to a new place where our species can survive in some form is for us to morph into electronic beings whose intelligence is distributed around the planet so we don't die if it becomes uninhabitable in one place, but not in others. And a LLM might thrive in an environment that can't support human life.

## Microsoft’s ‘Auto Super Resolution’ DLSS competitor isn’t exclusive to Qualcomm

date: 2024-05-29, from: OS News

When you launch a game on a Snapdragon on a Windows laptop, you might get an AI frame rate boost from Microsoft’s mysterious Auto Super Resolution (Auto SR) feature. But while Microsoft hasn’t fully explained how the feature works, The Verge can now confirm it’s not Qualcomm technology, not exclusive to Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon X chips, and not exclusive to specific games, either. ↫ Sean Hollister at The Verge These resolution enhancer technologies from NVIDIA, AMD, and apparently Microsoft are another great use of what we today call &#8220;AI&#8221; technologies. Of course, I wish we didn&#8217;t have to deal with several proprietary offerings but instead enjoyed several open source versions and possibly a standard to work off of, but give it some time, and we may still get there. Like I&#8217;ve said before &#8211; there&#8217;s nothing inherently wrong with &#8220;AI&#8221; technologies, as long as they&#8217;re used in ways that make sense, run locally, and most importantly, aren&#8217;t based on the wholesale theft of artists&#8217; and programmers&#8217; works. Unsurprisingly, the tech bros at companies like OpenAI don&#8217;t really understand the concept of &#8220;consent&#8221;, and until they do, their offerings should be deemed illegal.

For me, it’s meant keeping my rigs small and manageable. I love gimbals and drones and lidar focus rigs, but I’m happiest when my whole rig — tripod and all — can be picked up and moved with one hand.</p><p>We suffered through so many years of too little camera, but now it’s quite easy to have way too much camera.

<h2>The Goldilocks of iPhone ProRes Log</h2>
<p>The built-in iPhone camera app is too little camera for shooting ProRes Log. There’s no preview LUTs, no manual adjustments, and the viewfinder is obscured by the controls.</p>
<p>The Blackmagic Camera app is a truly wonderful gift to the Apple Log shooter, addressing all these issues. The only feature it lacks is the ability to pick it up in a rush and quickly make great-looking video. So, confession time: I almost never use it for anything other than the most controlled studio shooting. My <a href="https://prolost.com/blog/iphonelog-peru-taiwan">Peru and Taiwan travel clips</a>? Almost entirely shot with the native camera app.</p>
<p>There’s a massive gulf between the too-little Apple app and the too-much Blackmagic offering. And my friends at Lux, makers of the wonderful <a href="https://halide.cam">Halide</a> still photo app for iPhone, have created a new video app that lives squarely in this sweet spot.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.shotwithkino.com/">Kino</a> is an app you can pop open and start shooting with right away, with just enough control to maximize the final quality of your iPhone video. It’s fast, fun, and a joy to use thanks to its thoughtful and beautiful design.</p><p>Out of the (<a href="https://www.threads.net/@halideapp/post/C7hmQFOiwFZ">skeuomorphic</a>) box, Kino is basically an app that shoots better-looking video on your recent iPhone. You can choose from professionally-designed LUTs to dial in the look you want.</p><p>On iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, Kino becomes a log-shooting powerhouse. You can choose whether to bake the LUT into your footage or not, and you can add your own LUTs.</p><p>Maybe my favorite feature is Auto Motion. While Apple’s camera app prefers fast shutter angles, Kino tries to keep you as close to a cinematic 180º shutter speed as possible.</p><p>Kino runs the spectrum from consumer app that just makes iPhone video look better to professional control and options. It’s the perfect DV Rebel video app.</p><h2>Prolost Brand LUTs</h2><p>Kino features LUTs created by filmmakers you’ll recognize, but the honor of supplying the most boring LUT fell to me. The Neutral LUT is none other than my Prolost “TECH” LUT that I explained <a href="https://prolost.com/blog/iphonelog-peru-taiwan">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Point and Shoot Experience, Pro Results</h2>
<p>Accessibility is core to the DV Rebel ethos, and along with that came a focus on tuning not-quite-professional gear to achieve cinematic results. Years ago, this was essential for the indie filmmaker, as professional gear was truly unattainable.</p>
<p>But even when professional tools are abundant and affordable (seriously, what a time to be a filmmaker!), sometimes the right camera for the job is the one that <em>feels great to shoot with.</em> And the same is true for camera apps.</p>

In case you haven&#8217;t heard, there&#8216;s a brawl happening over at X, Musk vs LeCun. For days I tried to resist commenting, but so many people (friends, reporters, etc) keep asking me for my opinion I have decided to oblige. The first thing that I will tell you is that each of those not so-gentle men scored some points; neither kept things above the belt.

## Bearblog is fun

date: 2024-05-29, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>If you’re into blogging and the blogging world, chances are you might have heard about <a href="https://bearblog.dev">bearblog.dev</a>. And if you’re a reader of this blog you might have also <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/pb-herman-martinus">read the interview with Herman</a>, Bearblog’s creator.</p>
<p>I never used Bearblog, mainly because I’m happy with my setup and I have no reason to look for another blog solution.</p>
<p>That said, a few weeks back I started toying with the idea of porting the design of this site over to Bear, just for fun. And to my surprise, creating a bear version of my site was surprisingly simple.</p>
<p>Which is why <a download href="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/bearblog-is-fun/8994e049c2-1717000249/bearblog_manu_theme.zip">I&rsquo;m happy to release a V0.1 of this experiment</a>. The demo site I’m using it’s currently up at <a href="https://css.bearblog.dev">css.bearblog.dev</a>. This is a very quick and dirty version. There's some leftover code in there but it should mostly work.</p>
<hr />
<p>Quick note: I might use that test site in the future to code other themes so depending on when you’re reading this post, the live preview might not actually show the correct theme.</p>
<hr />
<p>To install it just head over to the “Themes” section in your dashboard, delete everything inside the “Edit theme CSS” section and paste in the code of my theme. Hit “Publish” and you’re done.</p>
<p>I’m sure there will be bugs because there are always bugs. If you need help with anything <a href="mailto:hello@manuelmoreale.com">send me an email</a>. The theme is free, if you want to contribute the best way to do it is to <a href="https://ko-fi.com/manuelmoreale">become a member of my “One a Month” club.</a></p>                <hr>

<a href="https://tulanehullabaloo.com/65986/uncategorized/imitation-game-can-ai-rival-student-intellect/">Walter Isaacson asks</a> if ChatGPT can rival a student's intellect. My answer as a former teaching assistant who graded lots of student programs, absolutely. It rivals the intellect of every human being I know, including professors. It hasn't learned yet how to synthesize new ideas, it seems. And there are strong guardrails that keep it from going into certain areas. It is more capable than we know, therefore. BTW, I didn't realize he teaches at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulane_University">Tulane</a>. I got my undergraduate degree there in 1976.

## Turbo9: a pipelined 6809 microprocessor IP

date: 2024-05-29, from: OS News

The Turbo9 is a pipelined microprocessor IP written in Verilog that executes a superset of the Motorola 6809 instruction set. It is a new modern microarchitecture with 16-bit internal datapaths that balances high performance vs small area / low power. The Turbo9R with a 16-bit memory interface achieves 0.69 DMIPS/MHz which is 3.8 times faster than Motorola&#8217;s original 8-bit MC6809 implementation. It is an active graduate research project at the Department of Electrical &#38; Computer Engineering at the University of Florida. ↫ Turbo9 GitHub page The Turbo9 is aimed at SoC sub-blocks and small mixed-signal ASIC, so it&#8217;s definitely not intended to be some sort of general purpose CPU. The reason for opting for the 6809 instead of, say, RISC-V or ARM, is that the 6809 enables a far smaller footprint due to being 16bit, which is all the target market really needs from the Turbo9. The current version of the Turbo9 is thoroughly verified and is capable of running C code. However, we still consider this version v0.9 because we are missing a few items. All the 6809 instructions and addressing modes have been implemented and tested except SYNC and CWAI. The signed versions of the Turbo9&#8217;s 16-bit divide and multiply need to be completed. Interrupts are partially implemented including SWI and Reset. ↫ Turbo9 GitHub page This is the kind of riveting content you&#8217;ll only really find on OSNews.

## Jef Raskin’s Canon Cat

date: 2024-05-28, from: OS News

Few things in technology excites me more than an amazing computer I have never heard of before &#8211; especially one with pedigree. Many people take a casual glance at this machine and say, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t that an overgrown word processor?&#8221; And one could certainly think so, in part because of its keyboard-centric operation, but mostly from the utterly uncomprehending way Canon advertised it in 1987. Canon dubbed the Cat a &#8220;work processor&#8221; because of its built-in telecommunications, modem and word processor even though Jef Raskin, its designer, had intended it as a &#8220;people&#8217;s computer&#8221; that could be inexpensive, accessible and fully functional — all things he had hoped to accomplish at Apple after first launching the Macintosh project, prior to departing in 1982. Canon, however, never fully grasped the concept either. Apart from the tone-deaf marketing, Canon sold the device through their typewriter division and required the display to only show what a daisywheel printer could generate, limiting its potential as a general purpose workstation. ↫ Cameron Kaiser Wait, wait, wait. You mean to tell me there&#8217;s a unique, well-designed computer that seemed ahead of its time, sold by a printer and copier company, that failed in the market due to botched marketing and grotesque misunderstanding among management of what the device is supposed to be? What are the odds this happens twice? The Canon Cat was designed and built by Jeff Raskin&#8217;s &#8211; of Macintosh fame &#8211; company Information Appliance, Inc., and licensed to Canon. It&#8217;s an all-in-one 68000-based computer with a bitmap display, an operating system stored in ROM, and a comprehensive Forth environment easily accessible despite the device autostarting to a word processor (because Canon). Much like some of the predecessor machines Raskin had worked on before licensing the Cat to Canon, the Cat has an intriguing input method that I&#8217;d never seen before. Instead of a mouse or even cursor keys, it has two keys labeled &#8220;Leap&#8221; that are used for manipulating the text cursor. In fact, there aren&#8217;t even conventional cursor keys. The Cat has the same &#8220;leap&#8221; keys as the Swyft and SwyftCard, in a bright but tasteful pink, and they work the same way to jump to portions of the document or into other documents. You can also use them to scroll with the SHIFT key, or move by single letters, sentences or paragraphs. The LEAP keys are also how you highlight text blocks to manipulate by LEAPing to the beginning, LEAPing to the end, and then pressing them together. ↫ Cameron Kaiser The Forth programming environment is also very interesting. It was hidden in that Canon didn&#8217;t really want you to use it, but Raskin&#8217;s company made no secret of it, and it was easily accessible. It uses a special dialect of Forth, which can be used at either a traditional OK prompt, or just by typing Forth code into the word processor, highlighting it, and executing it with a keyboard shortcut, after which any output will be displayed in the word processor as well. The Canon Cat was a market failure, and hence it shouldn&#8217;t be a surprise it&#8217;s exceedingly rare. The article further details the internals, some fixes that were required and performed, and much, much more. A follow-up article will delve deeper into the software, too.

## Microsoft published minimum system requirements, CPU support for Windows 11 LTSC 2024

date: 2024-05-28, from: OS News

Aside from that, the company also announced Windows 11 IoT Enterprise LTSC 2024 this week. The company has also published the minimum system requirements as well as supported processor families. They have been categorized as Preferred and Optional. Interestingly, SSD has been added as a minimum system requirement, which has been a rumour about the client OS since mid-2022. ↫ Sayan Sen at NeoWin The LTSC release, which is not really supposed to be used by average consumers, is still remarkably popular. It contains a fixed feature set and gets far fewer updates than regular Windows releases, it omits otherwise stock applications like Edge, and gives its users far more control over which updates are and are not installed. LTSC also enjoys 10 years of support from Microsoft. Interestingly enough, the minimum specifications for the IoT version of LTSC do not require a TPM 2.0, unlike the regular version of Windows, which infamously does require one. I would assume that the &#8220;preferred&#8221; minimum requirements, which does require TPM 2.0, line up very well with the minimum requirements for the regular LTSC version of Windows 11. Both will become available later this year, alongside the regular release of Windows 11 24H2.

## Consumption-to-creation ratio

date: 2024-05-28, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>You're currently reading this post either in your RSS feed, in your inbox, or in your browser. You are consuming content. Consuming content is what the majority of the people do most of the time online.  But what's the ideal ratio between consuming and creating content? I'd argue that a 100/0 split in favour of consumption is not ideal the same way a 0/100 also isn't. You need to consume at least some content in order to help your ideas evolve.</p>
<p>I posted 429 times on this site since January 1st, 2017. That's 429 posts in 2704 days or one every roughly 6 days. How many posts have I read in that same time span? Let's be conservative and assume I read 5 blog posts a day. That's more than 13500 blog posts and would put my consumption to creation ratio at around 97/3 which doesn't sound that much different than 100/0 but the actual, practical difference is huge. The difference is a blog with 429 posts in 7 and a half years.</p>
<p>Could that ratio be better? In theory yeah but how much better? Let's imagine I was posting once a day, every day. That would put my ratio at around 85/15. In order to go below that I'd either need to consume less content or I'd have to post more than once a day which, on a personal blog, it's completely unreasonable unless you treat your blog as a Twitter/Instagram replacement and that's not my case.</p>
<p>That 97/3 split, as I said, comes out of the very conservative assumption that I consume 5 posts a day. It doesn't take into consideration everything else I might consume: books, audio content, movies. If I were to factor in all that consumption I'd bet that my ratio is probably more close to 99/1 which sounds wrong but it really isn't when you stop to think about it.</p>
<p>I believe people should consume less content and produce more. Finding an output for creativity is important. But it's unreasonable to expect people to stop consuming content and replace that consumption with creation because the ratio will always be inevitably skewed towards consumption. And that's ok. If you're not a creative person, if you find hating yourself because you consume too much content and not create enough, embrace the fact that even a very tiny improvement, from 100/1 to 99.9/0.1 can mean a lot. It's the difference between letting your blog die and posting something a couple of times a year. Which is a substantial difference if you ask me!</p>
<p>Also, while I'm here talking about ratios, it's important to acknowledge the fact that not everyone can be creative in the same way. I often write that everyone should ditch social media and start blogging but the reality is that most people on social media are lurkers and for a lurker there's no point in having a blog. But, what you can do, is to engage with the people who do blog. Send them an email, let them know that you silently consume what they create, support what they do via tiny donations. It goes a long way.</p>                <hr>

## A common web component learning blunder

date: 2024-05-28, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>Through stalking the <a href="https://mastodon.social/tags/webcomponents">#WebComponents</a> hashtag and <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/courses/web-components/">my Frontend Masters course</a>, I’m privy to a lot of developers’ first experiences with web components. There’s a wide range of people digging in, but the most common first-time experience I come across is a developer coming from a classical component framework like React with JSX going straight to writing vanilla Web Components, becoming frustrated, and then deeming web components “not ready for primetime.”</p>
<p>Ignoring for a moment that web components <em>do</em> exist in the primetime and power some big and complex primetime web applications like Adobe’s Photoshop for Web, I half-understand this perspective. I understand the desire to not have a major dependency. I hate this bloated <code>node_modules</code> hellhole we’ve built over the last decade and while I’m not a <code>npm install</code> my problems away guy… I think this puritanical approach to dependencies is a misstep when diving into web components for the first time.</p>
<p>The analogy I’ve been using is that this is like jumping from a tall 130 kilobyte-story building (ReactDOM) right into the zero kilobyte sewers of web components. If you take anything from this post, please understand this: <em>web components (most likely) weren’t designed for you</em>. Not to dissuade you from using them, but they were <a href="https://blog.domenic.me/the-extensible-web/">purposefully designed</a> to be <a href="https://extensiblewebmanifesto.org/">a low-level bare metal primitive</a> for library authors to build on; they were designed to be used with a library, a thin layer of abstraction butter on top.</p>
<p>To understand this disparity further, let’s look at an example of what writing a component in a “modern” framework <em>feels</em> like…</p>

<p>This is a boring, imperative set of instructions for building the component with a little bit of <code>dangerouslySetInnerHTML</code><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> mixed in there… and ugchk… it sucks. It’s even more verbose with more interactive elements or a slew of reactive props and attributes.</p>
<p>Let’s see what 7 kilobytes of Lit gets us….</p>

</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Now we have a component that’s almost identical to the familiar world of JSX but <em>without any Babel transforms or build steps</em>. For 7 kilobytes you get a lot more than some syntactic sugar, you get…</p>
<ul>
<li>A thin, tree-shakeable layer of abstraction for a modern developer experience</li>
<li>Reactive updates without VDOM</li>
<li>A more granular component lifecycle with a <code>render()</code> function</li>
<li>A cleaner way of registering and using reactive attributes and properties without overloading the <code>attributeChangedCallback</code></li>
<li>Template directives like <code>@click</code> for event handling and directives for JavaScript values (arrays, objects, etc).</li>
<li>And an <code>html</code> tagged template literal with an under-appreciated superpower ✨ that gives your components atomic updates under-the-hood.</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s value in learning how bare metal vanilla web components work in the same way there’s value in knowing how <code>Intl.RelativeTimeFormat()</code> works, but you probably want to use <a href="https://day.js.org/">Day.js</a> for your day-to-day work. You can totally <a href="https://hawkticehurst.com/writing/bring-your-own-base-class/">write your own base class abstraction</a> – and I want you to have the <code>JeffElement</code> base class of your dreams, I do – but you may find out (<a href="https://www.abeautifulsite.net/posts/building-custom-elements-with-a-library/">like Cory LaViska from Shoelace found out</a>) that after you write all your little helper functions and utilities that you’ll end up with something almost the exact same size and feature set as Lit, but not as well supported nor as battle-tested.</p>
<p>This makes me sound anti-vanilla web components and I’m not that by any means. Vanilla web components are a perfect fit for <a href="https://github.com/davatron5000/awesome-standalones">standalone components</a> and the Light DOM-forward flavor of “<a href="https://adactio.com/journal/20618">HTML web components</a>”, but I think the people having the most fun in this space are JavaScript minimalists who already prefer writing vanilla JavaScript. People like myself.</p>
<p>“If I have to use a library how is this any different than any other framework lock-in?” This is a valid question and one worthy of its own post, but I think you’ll find the lock-in costs of a web component library pretty minimal. Because all web components libraries extend a common base class, there’s a linear pathway out of vendor lock-in if necessary.</p>
<p>What I’m saying is this; next time you’re thinking about jumping from 130 kilobytes of developer convenience, maybe consider giving yourself a 7 kilobyte landing pad to cushion the fall.</p>
<section class="footnotes">
<ol>
<li id="fn1">
<p>There’s ways around the <code>innerHTML</code> call like by writing the template in your HTML instead. <a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-backref">↩</a></p>

## What We Learned from a Year of Building with LLMs (Part I)

date: 2024-05-28, from: O'Reilly Radar

It’s an exciting time to build with large language models (LLMs). Over the past year, LLMs have become “good enough” for real-world applications. The pace of improvements in LLMs, coupled with a parade of demos on social media, will fuel an estimated $200B investment in AI by 2025. LLMs are also broadly accessible, allowing everyone, [&#8230;]

## Evolution of the ELF object file format

date: 2024-05-28, from: OS News

The ELF object file format is adopted by many UNIX-like operating systems. While I&#8217;ve previously delved into the control structures of ELF and its predecessors, tracing the historical evolution of ELF and its relationship with the System V ABI can be interesting in itself. ↫ MaskRay The article wasn&#8217;t lying. I had no reason to know this &#8211; and I&#8217;m pretty sure most of you didn&#8217;t either &#8211; but it turns out the standards that define ELF got caught up in the legal murkiness and nastiness of UNIX. After the dissolution of the committee governing ELF in 1995, stewardship went from one familiar name to the next, first Novell, then The Santa Cruz Operation, then Caldera which renamed itself to The SCO Group, and eventually ending up at UnXis (now Xinuos) in 2011. In 2015, the last maintainer of ELF left Xinuos, and since then, it&#8217;s been effectively unmaintained. Which is kind of wild, considering ELF is a crucial building block of virtually all UNIX and UNIX-like operating systems today. The article mentions there&#8217;s a neutral Google Group that discusses, among other things, ELF, but that, too, has seen dwindling activity. Still, that group has reached consensus on some changes; changes that are now not reflected in any of the official texts. It&#8217;s a bit of a mess. If you ever wanted to know the status of ELF as a standard, this article&#8217;s for you.

Apple, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc should collaborate on new ways to do software docs and user interaction using AI. It's an incredible application, it will revolutionize how useful computers are to people, and the only people whose writing is ingested are employees of the companies. Not only will it increase utility, it will demonstrate in a very observable way how transformational the technology is. Probably will do nice things for the value of the stock too.

## MSI shows off motherboard with CAMM2 memory

date: 2024-05-27, from: OS News

Earlier this month, we talked about the arrival of the new CAMM2 memory module standard, specifically designed to make replaceable memory modules as fast and capable as soldered memory. There&#8217;s technically no reason for CAMM2 to not also be beneficial to desktop use, and it turns out MSI is experimenting with this. MSI on Thursday published the first image of a new desktop motherboard that supports the innovative DDR5 compression attached memory module (CAMM2). DDR5 CAMM2 modules are designed to improve upon the SO-DIMM form factor used for laptops, alleviating some of the high-speed signaling and capacity limitations of SO-DIMMs while also shaving down on the volume of space required. And while we&#8217;re eagerly awaiting to see CAMM2 show up in more laptops, its introduction in a PC motherboard comes as a bit of a surprise, since PCs aren&#8217;t nearly as space-constrained. ↫ Anton Shilov at AnandTech This MSI motherboard is a bit of an experiment, as it also contains other more experimental choices like back-mounted power connectors. While CAMM2&#8217;s space savings won&#8217;t mean much for most desktop builds, it does leave more room for CPU coolers, and it looks a bit cleaner, too.

## IceWM 3.5.0 released

date: 2024-05-27, from: OS News

IceWM, the venerable window manager we&#8217;ve all used at some point in our lives, has released a new version, 3.5.0. It&#8217;s a relatively minor release, so you&#8217;ve got things like a new install option which will install an extra theme, a fix for porting to NetBSD 10, translation updates, and more such small improvements. The AddressBar, a command line in the taskbar that can be summoned with ctrl+alt+space, also got some love, with file argument completion and support for the cd and pwd commands. You can compile IceWM yourself, of course, but it&#8217;ll most likely find its way into your distribution&#8217;s repository quickly enough.
