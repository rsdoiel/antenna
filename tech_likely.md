## 2024-04-22 Gopher, again

date: 2024-05-01, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-04-22-gopher-again">2024-04-22 Gopher, again</h1>

<p>Having found a separate server, written in Go, monitored by systemd, to be the superior solution for double hosting my site for Gemini, I kept thinking about Gopher. With <a href="Odd%C2%B5">Oddµ</a> using a version of Markdown that is very close to the standard, and having found a library that I understand, more or less, which I had successfully grafted onto <a href="https://sr.ht/~gsthnz/satellite/">Satellite</a>, the Gemini server I’m using, based on renderer code I found in the <a href="https://github.com/tdemin/gmnhg">Hugo-to-Gemini converter</a> that used the same Markdown parsing library I was using for Oddµ, I figured that I might use the same library to turn Markdown into suitable Gopher pages.</p>

<p>It took some wrangling and it’s probably not great, but the main menu matches my front page and the blog posts look mostly OK, and so the site is back as a gopher hole on port 70!</p>

<p>See <a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/markdown-gopher.git">Markdown Gopher</a> for the Gopher server code.</p>

<p>See my <a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/satellite.git">patched Satellite</a> for the Gemini server code, <a href="2023-11-03-other-ports">discussed back in 2023</a>.</p>

<p>And naturally I’m immediately annoyed by the lack of UTF-8 support in this client I’m using.</p>

## Chinese Tencent-owned Riot Games installs rootkit on every League of Legends players’ computer

date: 2024-05-01, from: OS News

With 14.9, Vanguard, Riot’s proprietary Anti-Cheat system will be deployed and active in League of Legends. This means that active enforcement of Vanguard will be in effect and working hard to make sure your queues are free from scripters, botters, and cheaters! We recently released a blog detailing the “why” behind bringing Vanguard to League that you can check out here. It’s a bit of a long read, but it does have some pictures. ↫ Lilu Cabreros in the League of Legends patch notes The basic gist is that Vanguard is a closed-source, kernel-level rootkit for Windows that runs at all times, with the supposed goal of detecting and banning cheaters from playing League of Legends. This being a rootkit designed specifically to inject itself into the Windows kernel, it won&#8217;t work on Linux, and as such, the entire League on Linux community, which has been playing League for years now and even at times communicated with Riot employees to keep the game running, is now gone. Interestingly enough, Riot is not implementing Vanguard on macOS, which League of Legends also supports &#8211; because Apple simply doesn&#8217;t allow it. This is probably the most invasive, disturbing form of anticheat we&#8217;ve seen so far, especially since it involves such a hugely popular game. It&#8217;s doubly spicy because Riot Games is owned by Tencent, a Chinese company, which means a company owned and controlled by the Chinese government now has rootkits installed on the roughly 150 million players&#8217; computers all over the world. While we&#8217;re all (rightly, in my opinion) worried about TikTok, China just slipped 150 million rootkits onto computers all over the world. One really has to wonder where these increasingly invasive, anti-privacy and anti-user anticheat measures are going from here. Now that this rootkit can keep tabs on literally every single thing you do on your Windows computer, what&#8217;s going to be the next step? Anticheat might have to move towards using webcams to watch you play to prevent you from cheating, because guess what? The next level of cheating is already here, and it doesn&#8217;t even involve your computer. Earlier this year, hardware maker MSI showed off a gaming monitor that uses &#8220;AI&#8221; to see what&#8217;s going on on your monitor, and then injects overlays onto your monitor to help you cheat. MSI showed off how the monitor will use the League of Legends minimap to follow enemy champions and other relevant content, and then show warnings on your screen when enemies approach from off-screen. All of this happens entirely on the monitor&#8217;s hardware, and never sends any data whatsoever to the computer it&#8217;s attached to. It&#8217;s cheating that literally cannot be detected by anything running on your computer, rootkit or not. So, the only logical next step as such forms of cheating become more advanced and widespread is to force users to turn on their webcams, and point them at their displays. I fired up League of Legends today on my gaming computer &#8211; which runs Linux, of course &#8211; and after the League client &#8220;installed&#8221; the rootkit, it just got stuck in an endless loop of asking me to restart the client. I&#8217;ve been playing League of Legends for close to 14 years, and while I know the game &#8211; and especially its community &#8211; has a deservedly so bad reputation, I&#8217;ve always enjoyed the game with friends, and especially with my wife, who&#8217;s been playing for years and years as well. Speaking of my wife &#8211; even though she runs Windows and could easily install the rootkit if she wanted to, she has some serious doubts about this. When I explained what the Vanguard rootkit can do, her mouse pointer slowly moved away from the &#8220;Update&#8221; button, saying, &#8220;I&#8217;m not so sure about this&#8230;&#8221;

I keep wanting to <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/you-keep-using-that-word-i-do-not-think-it-means-what-you-think-it-means">say</a> "I do not think it means what you think it means," but then I realized, last night, for the first time, it's freaking poetry! A lot of it even rhymes. And it's a poem that will go on as long as the Knicks do. Unfortunately I don't think the MSG crew is going to be doing the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=nba+schedule&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&oq=nba+schedule&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i56i59j0i131i433i512j0i20i263i512j0i131i433i512j0i512j0i131i433i512l3j0i512.30465j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#sie=m;/g/11vwxq3z2y;3;/m/05jvx;dt;fp;1;;;">next game</a>. And btw, they do a much better job of camera work than ESPN. Maybe it's because the TV people have been able to iterate the camera setup the same way I iterate the UI of a piece of software. The same company owns the TV network as owns the arena as owns the team. It's all totally horizontally integrated. At dinner the other night a friend asked, if the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_L._Dolan">owner</a> of the Knicks wasn't a putz. I said of course, he's the worst but, the Knicks now are being well managed. So maybe he's mellowed out a bit?

## Linux Mint: non-GNOME GTK desktop environments need to work together in the face of libadwaita

date: 2024-05-01, from: OS News

Anyone who has spent any time recently using non-GNOME GTK desktop environments, like Cinnamon, MATE, or Xfce, has had to deal with the unfortunate reality of a lot of GTK applications becoming GNOME applications instead, using GNOME&#8217;s own libadwaita. These applications are hard to theme, and do not integrate at all with the proper GTK applications non-GNOME desktop environments ship with. With how popular GNOME is, this has meant that the number of non-GNOME GTK applications has been dwindling. Linux Mint, the popular Linux distribution that also develops the Cinnamon desktop environment, has long made a bundle of GTK applications called XApps &#8211; basically forks of various core GNOME 3.x applications to ensure they would have access to non-GNOME GTK applications. With GNOME effectively forking GTK into its own, unique, GNOME-specific style (like libaidwaita), other GTK environments have suffered, and XApps were intended to close that gap. That hasn&#8217;t really happened though, as XApps remained mostly a Mint-only thing, managed by Mint, as part of the Mint/Cinnamon GitHub projects. Other distributions and GTK desktop environments, such as Xfce, MATE, Budgie, and so on, didn&#8217;t really pick them up. The Linux Mint project intends to change that, and will &#8216;spin off&#8217; the XApps into its own, dedicated, independent project to facilitate cross-distribution and cross-DE collaboration, decision-making and development, all in an effort to ensure the long-term viability of non-GNOME GTK desktop environments. They also intend to fork a lot more of the GNOME 3 applications, for the same reason I mentioned earlier: GNOME applications are no longer GTK applications, but GNOME applications &#8211; they look and feel horribly out of place in environments that don&#8217;t use the GNOME-specific libadwaita. As such, Celluloid, GNOME Calculator, Simple Scan, Baobab, System Monitor, GNOME Calendar, File Roller, and Zenity were recently downgraded in Linux Mint to their last GTK 3 versions, and will most likely be forked in the near future. In addition, the Adwaita theme, the default GNOME/GTK theme, will be removed from the list of available themes in Cinnamon 6.2. Adwaita, too, has become increasingly GNOME-only, and thus, increasingly broken on non-GNOME desktop environments. Flat-our removing Adwaita altogether is not possible, since it&#8217;s a GTK dependency, but hiding it from the theme selector is not an issue, of course. As project lead Clément Lefèbvre writes: libAdwaita is for GNOME and GNOME only. We can’t blame GNOME for this, they’ve been very clear about it from the start. It was made specifically for GNOME to have more freedom and build its own ecosystem without impacting GTK. We want to send a strong signal upstream and towards other projects. We cannot and will not support applications which do not support our users and environments. We can’t promote applications to our users which don’t support our users. The software manager will be vigilant towards that going forward and list compatible software by default. ↫ Clément Lefèbvre All of this is great news to hear. I&#8217;ve been making extensive use of Xfce on OpenBSD lately, and on the Fedora Xfce spin in the weeks before that, and the situation has become almost comical. If you install any GNOME application on Xfce, theming just breaks down completely, as most themes are either not made to support the massive headerbars GNOME uses, or they do support it but still look horribly out of place compared to the more sane titlebar plus menubar plus toolbar layout of traditional desktop environments like Xfce. I&#8217;ve long been saying that the non-GNOME GTK desktop environments need to work together to formulate an answer to the onslaught of libadwaita and the GNOME-ification of GTK, because each of them risks becoming entirely tied to whatever GNOME and libadwaita decides to do, for better or worse. It seems the Linux Mint team has finally realised this as well, and I really hope &#8211; and strongly suggest &#8211; Xfce, MATE, and others join them as well. If they don&#8217;t, there won&#8217;t be an Xfce in a few years. What&#8217;s the point in developing Xfce if you&#8217;re at the mercy of whatever choices GNOME makes?

## Redox gets USB HID support

date: 2024-05-01, from: OS News

Another month, another detailed report about the progress made in Redox, the Rust-based operating system. A major improvements this month is support for USB HID, allowing USB keyboards and mice to work on Redox, but the project does note USB hubs are still problematic and might not work properly. Thanks to these USB improvements, Redox&#8217; desktop environment Orbital now also ran on ARM64 in Qemu for the first time, which is a great step towards running it on real ARM64 hardware. A massive documentation pass has also taken place, fixing various errors and improving and simplifying the writing. More programs have been ported, of course, and various lower-level improvements and fixes, along with a number of other fixes and changes across the operating system.

## Seeking consultancy: understanding joining obstacles for non-member journals

date: 2024-05-01, from: Crossref Blog

<p>Crossref is undertaking a large program, dubbed <a href="https://www.crossref.org/community/special-programs/resourcing-crossref/">'RCFS' (Resourcing Crossref for Future Sustainability)</a> that will initially tackle five specific issues with our fees. We haven’t increased any of our fees in nearly two decades, and while we’re still okay financially and do not have a revenue growth goal, we do have inclusion and simplification goals. <a href="https://www.crossref.org/pdfs/research-consulting-rcfs-report-public.pdf">This report from Research Consulting</a> helped to narrow down the five priority projects for 2024-2025 around these three core goals:</p>
<h2 id="scope-of-the-rcfs-program-2024-2025">Scope of the RCFS Program 2024-2025</h2>
<div class="shortcode-divwrap green-highlight">
<span><h4 id="goal-more-equitable-fees">GOAL: MORE EQUITABLE FEES</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Project 1</strong>: Evaluate the USD $275 annual membership fee tier and propose a more equitable pricing structure, which might entail breaking this down into two or more different tiers.</li>
<li><strong>Project 2</strong>: Define a new basis for sizing and tiering members for their capacity to pay</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="goal-simplify-complex-fees">GOAL: SIMPLIFY COMPLEX FEES</h4>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Project 3</strong>: Address and adjust <em>volume</em> discounts for Content Registration</li>
<li><strong>Project 4</strong>: Address and adjust <em>backfile</em> discounts for Content Registration</li>
</ol>

<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Project 5</strong>: Reflect the increasing value of Crossref as a metadata source, likley increasing Metadata Plus fees</li>
</ol>
</span>
</div>
<h2 id="work-to-date">Work to date</h2>
<p>As part of the RCFS program, we are working closely with our Membership &amp; Fees Committee to discuss insights, gather feedback, and make recommendations to the Board. As a first step, we have surveyed and received responses from around 1000 of the current 8,000 Crossref members in our lowest membership fee tier ($275 USD). We are now starting to distill that data and will discuss it on our <a href="https://www.crossref.org/events/the-shape-of-things-to-come">community call on May 8th</a> and subsequently with the M&amp;F Committee to inform recommendations for fee changes that may going into effect in 2025 or 2026.</p>
<h2 id="request-for-information-rfi-about-community-consultation-project">Request For Information (RFI) about community consultation project</h2>
<p>While we have useful data from existing Crossref members, we know that there are many thousands of journals that are not (yet) members, and we need to understand this group better, in particular, to document and address the financial obstacles as well as the technical or social challenges.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are looking for community facilitation expertise, with multiple language skills, to conduct a series of focus groups with non-member journals, with a summary and insights report (in English) provided by the end of June 2024.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All the data and documentation will be available publicly on the dedicated <a href="https://www.crossref.org/community/special-programs/resourcing-crossref/">RCFS Program website</a></p>
<p>As well as designing, conducting, and summarising the results of some focus groups (participants for which will be gathered via our own contacts and those of partners such as DOAJ, EIFL, and the Free Journal Network) we would like the consultant to review work such as the <a href="https://diamasproject.eu/diamas-results-institutional-landscape-survey/" target="_blank">DIAMAS institutional publishing report</a>, and identify data relevant to Crossref’s fee model.</p>
<p>If you would like to respond, please provide the following information and send it to Kora Korzec at <a href="mailto:feedback@crossref.org">feedback@crossref.org</a> by <strong>15th May</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your consultancy organisation and your role within it</li>
<li>Examples of similar market research undertaken</li>
<li>Languages spoken within your team</li>
<li>Confirmation that the timeline is workable</li>
<li>Approximate fee, likely range, or structure/basis for your fee</li>
</ul>
<p>Equally, if you represent a journal or group of journals, such as Diamond Open Access journals, and are not yet using Crossref, please get in touch and we can include your group in the research.</p>

## You can’t just assume UTF-8

date: 2024-04-30, from: OS News

Humans speak countless different languages. Not only are these languages incompatible, but runtime transpilation is a real pain. Sadly, every standardisation initiative has failed. At least there is someone to blame for this state-of-affairs: God. It was him, after-all, who cursed humanity to speak different languages, in an early dispute over a controversial property development. However, mankind can only blame itself for the fact that computers struggle to talk to each other. And one of the biggest problems is the most simple: computers do not agree on how to write letters in binary. ↫ Cal Paterson For most users, character encoding issues are not something they have to deal with. Programmers and other people who deal with the lower levels of computing, however, deal with this way more often than they should.

## A few facts about POSIX

date: 2024-04-30, from: OS News

Over 35 years ago, these problems with software portability led to the emergence of the first POSIX standard in 1988. The acronym was coined by Richard Stallman, who added &#8220;X&#8221; to the end of Portable Operating System Interface. It&#8217;s meant to provide a specification of the interface that different Unix operating systems should have in common, including programming languages and tools. It&#8217;s important to note that the interface is portable, and not the implementation. ↫ vorakl While POSIX certainly isn&#8217;t perfect, and support for it in various operating systems claiming to support POSIX even less so, there&#8217;s no denying its success. Even if the dream of 100% source code portability isn&#8217;t possible under POSIX for applications that are a little more complex than basic CLI tools, there&#8217;s enough portability that platforms like Linux, the various BSDs, macOS, and others, can share quite a bit of code. One of my favourite things about POSIX is that it shows up in the most unexpected of places. Windows, for instance, has had various options for POSIX compatibility, some of which straight from Microsoft itself, like the currently well-known Windows Subsystem for Linux, but also mostly forgotten options like the Microsoft POSIX subsystem that shipped with Windows NT until Windows 2000, or the very rudimentary POSIX compatibility in the Windows C Runtime Library and Windows Sockets API. OS/2 had POSIX compatibility as well, through EMX (Eberhard Mattes eXtender). It gave OS/2 &#8211; and MS-DOS &#8211; a POSIX API, and even provided access to native OS/2 APIs as well, and could run 32bit applications. You&#8217;d be surprised by how many more operating systems offered forms of POSIX compatibility, either out of the box or through first or third party add-ons.

Earlier today, a Senior Staff Software Engineer at Google who, according to their LinkedIn, leads the Android Systems Team and works on Android’s Linux kernel fork, submitted a series of patches to AOSP that “remove ACK’s support for riscv64.” The description of these patches states that “support for risc64 GKI kernels is discontinued.” ↫ Mishaal Rahman Google provided Android Authority with a statement, claiming that Android will continue to support RISC-V. What these patches do, however, is remove support for the architecture from the Generic Kernel Image, which is the only type of kernel Google certifies for Android, which means that it is now no longer possible to ship a certified Android device that uses RISC-V. Any OEM shipping a RISC-V Android device will have to create and maintain its own kernel fork with the required patches. This doesn&#8217;t seem to align with Google&#8217;s statement. So, unless Google intends to add RISC-V support back into GKI, there won&#8217;t be any officially certified Android devices running on RISC-V. Definitely an odd chain of events here.

## It's different after its gone

date: 2024-04-30, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><i>Note: This post is the summary of a <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/30/weNeedMoreChange.m4a">podcast</a>. </i></p>
<p>When my mother died in 2018, it didn't settle in that the context in which I lived, my whole life, was gone. </p>
<p>She lived in the house I was raised in. Very little had changed in that house. I hadn't lived there since I went away to college, but it still defined who I was, an adult who didn't live in his childhood home. When we sold the house, the last time I saw it, it was empty, and that was when it hit me. That part of my life is over. I no longer have a home I can return to.</p>
<p>The same is true with our understanding of who we are as adult American citizens. Until now we felt we had a vote. But that is over, unless we change our view of the country we live in. It's not that it's about to change, which is what you hear in the news, and on social web -- <i>it has already changed. </i></p>
<p>We now understand that Trump may be above the law but that masks a bigger truth, the Supreme Court is already above the law. They take bribes, openly. They cannot be prosecuted (just try it and see what happens). They openly side with the insurrection, yet don't recuse when deciding issues of what to do with the insurrectionists. They imagine the president is a monarch. </p>
<p>We're already living in the authoritarian state we're worried about. We haven't caught up with that reality yet. </p>
<p>Our government is more concerned about our right to own guns than it is with our right to own our own bodies. Stop for a moment and let that sink in. If I said you don't own your own body, what would you think I'm talking about? Answer: Slavery. </p>
<p>If we did catch up with that reality, we would start organizing now to undo that mistake. We would not only re-elect Biden in a landslide, but we'd insist that he expand the court to 100 members serving 10-year terms each, retroactive. And thus we would eliminate one of the huge problems in our system of government. Have they proved they need this kind of correction? Yes, the overturning of Roe, and the lack of prosecution of Trump for trying to overthrow the government are all the proof we need. </p>
<p>And from then-on, no politician in any branch of government would take us for granted.</p>

And they don't take the bait to make it about anything other than what happens on the court, and to trust in the league to take care of players who don't play by the rules. And <i>of course</i> the Philadelphia arena was full of Knicks fans. The tickets cost a lot less than NYC tickets, and it's only 2 hours away by car, and there's good train service. If the series goes back to Philadelphia, the same thing will happen. I feel sorry for fans of small town teams, because no matter where you go in the US, there are always lots of Knicks fans. Largest city in the country.

## 9front “DO NOT INSTALL” released

date: 2024-04-29, from: OS News

There&#8217;s a new 9front release! So, what exactly is 9front, you may ask? Well, after it became clear that Bell Labs wasn&#8217;t doing much with plan9, a group of developers took matters into their own hands and created 9front, a fork of plan9. Their latest release is called DO NOT INSTALL, and brings things like more USB audio support, DNS over TLS, WiFi support for the Raspberry Pi, I2C support, and much more. I&#8217;m not particularly well-versed in the world of plan9, and more often than not it feels like a form of high-level programming performance art that I&#8217;m just not smart enough to understand. The whole community and its associated web sites have a very unique feel to it, and I always feel like I&#8217;m just not cool enough to be part of it. That&#8217;s not a dig at the plan9 community &#8211; it&#8217;s more of an indictment of my lack of coolness. Which really shouldn&#8217;t come as a surprise.

## run0: a systemd-based, more secure replacement for sudo

date: 2024-04-29, from: OS News

Lennart Poettering, main developer of systemd, has announced run0, a systemd-based replacement for the well-known sudo command that fixes many of he inherent issues with the widely used tool to gain temporary elevated privileges. There are various problems with sudo, which basically come down to that it&#8217;s a large SUID binary, meaning it consists of privileged code that unprivileged users can run from their own context. This makes sudo a fairly large attack surface, and why OpenBSD uses doas instead; while doas suffers from the same main problem, it&#8217;s much smaller and reduces the attack surface considerably. SUID processes are weird concepts: they are invoked by unprivileged code and inherit the execution context intended and controlled by unprivileged code. By execution context I mean the myriad of properties that a process has on Linux these days, from environment variables, process scheduling properties, cgroup assignments, security contexts, file descriptors passed, and so on and so on. A few of these settings the kernel is nice enough to clean up automatically when a SUID binary is invoked, but much of it has to be cleaned up by the invoked suid binary. This has to be done very very carefully, and history has shown that SUID binaries are generally pretty shit at that. ↫ Lennart Poettering Poettering wants to address this problem, and has come up with run0, which behaves like sudo, but works entirely differently and is not SUID. Run0 asks the services manager to create a shell or command under the target user&#8217;s ID, creating a new PTY, sending data back and forth from the originating TTY and the new PTY. Or in other words: the target command is invoked in an isolated exec context, freshly forked off PID 1, without inheriting any context from the client (well, admittedly, we *do* propagate $TERM, but that&#8217;s an explicit exception, i.e. allowlist rather than denylist). One could say, &#8220;run0&#8221; is closer to behaviour of &#8220;ssh&#8221; than to &#8220;sudo&#8221;, in many ways. Except that it doesn&#8217;t bother with encryption or cryptographic authentication, key management and stuff, but instead relies on the kernel&#8217;s local identification mechanisms. run0 doesn&#8217;t implement a configuration language of its own btw (i.e. no equivalent of /etc/sudoers). Instead, it just uses polkit for that, i.e. how we these days usually let unpriv local clients authenticate against priv servers. ↫ Lennart Poettering This approach addresses a whole slew of attack vectors on sudo, and it comes with fun additional features like being able to give your terminal a different background tint when using it, or displaying a little red dot in the terminal window title to further indicate you&#8217;re using elevated privileges. It will ship as part of the upcoming release of systemd 256.

## Microsoft At Work

date: 2024-04-29, from: OS News

Well, this was a wild goose chase of a read. J. B. Crawford dove into the history of something I&#8217;ve never heard of &#8211; Microsoft At Work &#8211; and came away with a story that&#8217; while clearer thanks to his research, is still frustratingly nebulous. I&#8217;m still not entirely sure what Microsoft At Work really was, but I think it had the goal of running Windows on communications devices like faxes, to make it easier to share and work on documents across various devices. Crawford did a lot of digging, and eventually settles on what he thinks might be a description of what MAW really consisted of. I am being a bit dismissive for effect. MAW was more ambitious than just installing Windows on a grape. The effort included a unified communications protocol for the control of office machines, including printers, for which a whole Microsoft stack was envisioned. This built on top of the Windows Printing System, a difficult-to-search-for project that apparently predated MAW by a short time, enough so that Windows Printing System products were actually on the market when MAW was announced&#8212;MAW products were, we will learn, very much not.  MAW devices like the Ricoh IFS77 ran 16-bit Windows 3.1 with a new GUI intended to appear more modern while reducing resource requirements. Some reporters at the time noted that Microsoft was cagey about the supported architectures, I suspect they were waiting on ports to be completed. The fax machine was probably x86, though, as there&#8217;s little evidence MAW actually ran on anything else. ↫ J. B. Crawford The &#8217;90s were a wild time, especially as Microsoft, and this MAW project seems to have &#8217;90s written all over it, but I&#8217;d still love to learn a lot more about this. I hope this article will bring out some former Microsoft execs or employees who can give us more details, and possibly even some code. I want to know how this works and what it did.

## The first video game, Spacewar!, on the DEC PDP-1 in your browser

date: 2024-04-29, from: OS News

This is a virtual DEC PDP-1 (emulated in HTML5/JavaScript) running the original code of &#8220;Spacewar!&#8221;, the earliest known digital video game. If available, use gamepads or joysticks for authentic gameplay — the game was originally played using custom “control boxes”. Spacewar! was conceived in 1961 by Martin Graetz, Stephen Russell, and Wayne Wiitanen. It was first realized on the PDP-1 in 1962 by Stephen Russell, Peter Samson, Dan Edwards, and Martin Graetz, together with Alan Kotok, Steve Piner, and Robert A Saunders. ↫ Norbert Landsteiner It&#8217;s wild to me that even for the very first video game, they already made what are effectively controllers anyone today could pick up and use. Note that this emulator can run more than just Spacewar!.

## Thoughts on Cosmotechnics

date: 2024-04-29, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>A fine post by Ethan Marcotte called <a href="https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/the-negotiation-cycle/"><em>The negotiation cycle</em></a> led me to an incredible essay by Alan Jacobs called <a href="https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/from-tech-critique-to-ways-of-living"><em>From Tech Critique to Ways of Living</em></a>. It references an old idea called “The SCT<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>” which is new to me but based on thinking by the likes of Ursula Franklin and Neil Postman who I am familiar with. Neil Postman’s <em>Technopoly</em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup> –which I read in March– was one of the best books on technology I’ve ever read, so this is relevant for me.</p>
<p>Jacobs’ essay takes an unexpected yet welcome turn towards Daoism linking to a heavier essay by Yuk Hui called <a href="https://www.e-flux.com/journal/86/161887/cosmotechnics-as-cosmopolitics/"><em>Cosmotechnics and Cosmopolitics</em></a>. I’m not smart enough to fully understand all these philosophical (epistemological?) arguments<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>, but reading the word “cosmotechnics” felt like a beacon in the night for a concept I’ve intuitively felt but never had a word to describe. In Hui’s words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let me give you a preliminary definition of cosmotechnics: it is the unification of the cosmos and the moral through technical activities, whether craft-making or art-making.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe that science and technology are moral. Try as we may to divorce a tool from an outcome, there is always an interplay. As a contrived example, I can make a <code>&lt;Button/&gt;</code> component and it would by itself be morally neutral. But if I make a <code>&lt;Button/&gt;</code> that someone with a disability cannot use, then I have made a moral decision through either action or inaction. Similarly, I can make a <code>&lt;Button/&gt;</code> that puts a stuffed animal in a digital shopping cart, that is morally neutral. But if that stuffed animal is knowingly assembled with child labor and dropshipped from afar with an immense carbon cost relative to the value of the item, I have made an immoral <code>&lt;Button/&gt;</code>. It’s not hard for me to imagine that someone somewhere is making a <code>&lt;Button/&gt;</code> component that launches a nuclear missile…</p>
<p>In the words of Dr. King from his sermon <em><a href="https://daverupert.com/2019/06/the-three-evils-of-society/">The Three Evils of Society</a></em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“When scientific power outruns moral power, we end up with guided missiles and misguided men.”<br />
– Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But if you believe technology is moral, then the next larger follow up question is “Whose morals?”</p>
<hr />
<p>This question of “Whose morals?” permeates my thoughts, specifically in regards to global challenges like climate change. Call me unpatriotic, but I don’t think rugged American individualism is going to manifest destiny our way out of the climate crisis. A technological breakthrough seems unlikely. We need to rely on the knowledge and experiences of African, Asian, and Indigenous societies who have a different ontology, a different Dao (a code of behavior that is in harmony with the natural order); one that prioritizes the group over the individual. In less metaphysical terms, I believe we need to listen to societies built on cooperation and sharing of limited resources over societies built on the continuous expansion of dominion through exploitation of markets, labor, and people.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We need a new language of cosmopolitics to elaborate this new world order that goes beyond a single hegemon.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree with Hui that a singular perspective cannot and will not solve the current crisis we are facing. Technology alone will not save us. We need scientific power in the hands of moral-powered men and women. And the longer we wait the more we risk erasing the communities and ancient knowledge we need to find an equitable solution.</p>
<hr />
<p>Climate change, geopolitical conflict, the rise of authoritarianism brought about by social media companies… these are all large problems that take governments decades to solve. That puts cosmotechnics far away from me, a would-be practitioner. Hui thankfully provides a story from the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuangzi_(book)">Zhuangzi</a></em>; the butcher Pao Ding.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pao Ding is excellent at butchering cows. He claims that the key to being a good butcher doesn’t lie in mastering certain skills, but rather in comprehending the Dao. Replying to a question from Duke Wen Huei about the Dao of butchering cows, Pao Ding points out that having a good knife is not necessarily enough; it is more important to understand the Dao in the cow, so that one does not use the blade to cut through the bones and tendons, but rather to pass alongside them in order to enter into the gaps between them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the kind of web development I like. It agrees with me. I better understand the <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/dao/">Dao of web design</a>. Our apps and websites are like water, flowing in and out of viewports. Contextualizing themselves to the recipient’s limitations or preferences. Those who find the easier paths through the gaps become excellent butchers of websites.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pao Ding adds that a good butcher has to change his knife once a year because he cuts through tendons, while a bad butcher has to change his knife every month because he cuts through bones. Pao Ding, on the other hand—an <em>excellent</em> butcher—has not changed his knife in nineteen years, and it looks as if it has just been sharpened with a whetstone. Whenever Pao Ding encounters any difficulty, he slows down the knife and gropes for the right place to move further.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another translation I read phrased the bad butcher as “hacking” through bones and what a serviceable metaphor we’ve found! The knife, a technology. The medium, a cow or software. Our tools will last longer if we learn how to slow down and understand the nature of the medium, <a href="https://frankchimero.com/blog/2015/the-webs-grain/">the grain</a>, rather than hacking against it.</p>
<p>The hustle and bustle of capitalism and keeping up with the zeitgeist makes this hard. There’s a pressure to keep up, lest you fall off the cliff of irrelevance. After all, technology always only advances and there’s always a better knife in the distance… right?</p>
<p>Over the years I’ve heard myself referred to as a “curmudgeon”, “old guard”, “gatekeeper”, and “dinosaur”. That is due in part to my loudmouthed punditry but also because I dislike a specific technology from an <a href="https://erinkissane.com/meta-in-myanmar-part-i-the-setup">immoral company</a> that does our industry, society, and users irreparable harm. Moving fast and rethinking best practices spawned untold lifetimes worth of human hours dedicated to knife swapping each year. And when tools dull, we throw stones at each other.</p>
<p>I’ve always been overly cautious and considered in the tools I use but I’ve never thought of the tools I use as  a moral choice. Perhaps now I will. I’m not a Daoist by any means, but this idea of <em>cosmotechnics</em> begins to provide a mental framework for expressing the relationship between technology and morality. From the large scale of the cosmos to the small scale of the knife, I’m glad to have vocabulary to think about future problems.</p>

<p>One nuanced point I disagree with Hui on is on who should hold the leading power in this new cosmopolitical system.

## Windows NT and NetWare on PA-RISC, and a HP-UX port to x86

date: 2024-04-28, from: OS News

Back when I was working on my article about PA-RISC, HP-UX, and UNIX workstations in general, I made extensive use of OpenPA, Paul Weissmann&#8217;s invaluable and incredibly detailed resource about HP&#8217;s workstation efforts, HP-UX, and tons of related projects and products. Weissmann&#8217;s been doing some serious digging, and has unearthed details about a number of essentially forgotten operating system efforts. First, it turns out HP was porting Windows NT to PA-RISC in the early &#8217;90s. Several magazine sources and USEnet posts around 1993 point to HP pursuing a PA-RISC port to NT, modified the PA-RISC architecture for bi-endianess and even conducted a back-room presention at the ’94 Comdex conference of a (modified HP 712?) PA-7100LC workstation running Windows NT. Mentions of NT on PA-RISC continued in 1994 with some customer interest but ended around 1995. ↫ Paul Weissmann at OpenPA The port eventually fizzled out due to a lack of interest from both customers and application developers, and HP realised its time was better spent on the future of x86, Intel&#8217;s Itanium, instead. HP also planned to work together with Novell to port NetWare to PA-RISC, but the work took longer than expected and it, too, was cancelled. The most recent secretive effort was the port of HP-UX to x86, an endeavour that took place during the final days of the UNIX workstation market. Parts of the conversation in these documents mention a successful boot of HP-UX on x86 in December of 2009, with porting efforts projected to cost 100M+ between 2010 and 2016. The plan was for mission-critical x86 systems (ProLiant DL980 and Superdome with x86) and first releases projected in 2011 (developer) and 2012 (Superdome and Linux ABI). ↫ Paul Weissmann at OpenPA I&#8217;m especially curious about that last one, as porting HP-UX to x86 seems like a massive effort during a time where it was already obvious Linux had completely obliterated the traditional UNIX market. It really feels like the last death saving throws of a platform everybody already knew wasn&#8217;t going to make it.

I'm also blocking people who hype ActivityPub in comments to my posts about social web stuff that has nothing to do with AP. I've been down this road before. I just want to find people with <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/16/140810.html">active minds</a>, whose business is interop, who want to try stuff out. AP is not a good foundation to build on, at least until they come up with a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22busy+developer+guide%22">BDG</a> for it. Basically it isn't a standard even though they say it is. If you want to help your cause: 1. Stop hyping. 2. Get busy with that BDG.

## A cautionary travel tale

date: 2024-04-28, from: Status-Q blog

On Monday evening, I had a ticket booked to bring me back on the overnight ferry from the Hook of Holland to Harwich. (Here&#8217;s a bit of trivia for you: &#8216;Hook of Holland&#8217; is actually a mistranslation of the Dutch name Hoek van Holland. &#8216;Hoek&#8217;, in Dutch, means &#8216;corner&#8217;, not &#8216;hook&#8217;.

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/11/09/bowHunter.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">These days I'm using the moderation tools on the social web more than I did in the past. If someone I don't know posts a negative comment on Facebook, in response to something I posted, I just delete it, because they have that feature (other systems don't, they should). Any lurker who happens by is free to enjoy what I write. But if I don't know you, I honestly don't care what you think, esp if it's negative and has less than ten syllables total. It's hit and run spam for sure. I'm widening my definition of spam all the time. If you add up all the responses that actually mean anything, it doesn't amount to much. Let's see what the social web looks like without hearing from all assholes.

## GNOME Foundation in financial trouble

date: 2024-04-28, from: OS News

As you may be aware, the GNOME Foundation has operated at a deficit (nonprofit speak for a loss – ie spending more than we’ve been raising each year) for over three years, essentially running the Foundation on reserves from some substantial donations received 4-5 years ago. The Foundation has a reserves policy which specifies a minimum amount of money we have to keep in our accounts. This is so that if there is a significant interruption to our usual income, we can preserve our core operations while we work on new funding sources. We’ve now “hit the buffers” of this reserves policy, meaning the Board can’t approve any more deficit budgets – to keep spending at the same level we must increase our income. ↫ Robert McQueen Learning that the GNOME Foundation can barely scrape by financially makes me irrationally angry. As much as I&#8217;ve grown to dislike using GNOME and thus switched all my machines over to KDE, GNOME is still the most popular desktop environment and used extensively by pretty much all the big corporate Linux distributions. How is it possible that this hugely popular and important open source project has to beg individual users for donations like they&#8217;re running an independent tech website or something? Where&#8217;s all the financial support from Red Hat, IBM, Oracle, Canonical, and so on? If not even an insanely popular project like GNOME can be financially stable, what hope is there for the countless small, unknown open source projects that form the basis of our entire computing world?

## A BSD person tries Alpine Linux

date: 2024-04-28, from: OS News

In February last year I wrote about running a FreeBSD desktop, and concluded that sometimes you need to give yourself permission to tinker. Well recently I’ve started tinkering with Alpine Linux! It’s been recommended to me for years, so I’m finally getting around to checking it out. There’s a lot to like if you come from BSD, which we’ll dig into here. ↫ Ruben Schade Just a quick look at this unexpectedly popular Linux distribution that really has its own identity.
