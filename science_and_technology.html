id="ipod-fans-evade-apples-drm-to-preserve-54-lost-clickwheel-era-games">iPod
fans evade Apple’s DRM to preserve 54 lost clickwheel-era games</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-06, from: OS News</p>
<p>Old-school Apple fans probably remember a time, just before the
iPhone became a massive gaming platform in its own right, when Apple
released a wide range of games designed for late-model clickwheel iPods.
While those clickwheel-controlled titles didn’t exactly set the gaming
world on fire, they represent an important historical stepping stone in
Apple’s long journey through the game industry. Today, though, these
clickwheel iPod games are on the verge of becoming lost media—impossible
to buy or redownload from iTunes and protected on existing devices by
incredibly strong Apple DRM. Now, the classic iPod community is engaged
in a quest to preserve these games in a way that will let enthusiasts
enjoy these titles on real hardware for years to come. ↫ Kyle Orland at
Ars Technica A nice effort, of course, and I’m glad someone is putting
time and energy into preserving these games and making them accessible
to a wider audience. As is usual with Apple, these small games were
heavily encumbered with DRM, being locked to both the the original
iTunes account that bought them, but also to the specific hardware
identifier of the iPod they were initially synchronised to using iTunes.
A clever way around this DRM exists, and it involves collectors and
enthusiasts creating reauthorising their iTunes accounts to the same
iTunes installation, and thus adding their respective iPod games to that
single iTunes installation. Any other iPods can then be synced to that
master account. The iPod Clickwheel Games Preservation Project takes
this approach to the next level, by setting up a Windows virtual machine
with iTunes installed in it, which can then be shared freely around the
web for people to the games to their collection. This is a rather
remarkably clever method of ensuring these games remain accessible, but
obviously does require knowledge of setting up Qemu and USB passthrough.
I personally never owned an iPod – I was a MiniDisc fanatic until my
Android phone took over the role of music player – so I also had no clue
these games even existed. I assume most of them weren’t exactly great to
control with the limited input method of the iPod, but that doesn’t mean
there won’t be huge numbers of people who have fond memories of playing
these games when they were younger – and thus, they are worth
preserving. We can only hope that one day, someone will create a virtual
machine that can run the actual iPod operating system, called Pixo
OS.</p>

<h2 id="windows-server-iot-2025-released">Windows Server IoT 2025
released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>Today, Microsoft announced the general availability of Windows Server
IoT 2025. This new release includes several improvements, including
advanced multilayer security, hybrid cloud agility, AI, performance
enhancements, and more. Microsoft claims that Windows Server IoT 2025
will be able to handle the most demanding workloads, including AI and
machine learning. It now has built-in support for GPU partitioning and
the ability to process large datasets across distributed environments.
With Live Migration and High Availability, it also offers a
high-performance platform for both traditional applications and advanced
AI workloads. ↫ Pradeep Viswanathan at Neowin Windows Server IoT 2025
brings the same benefits, new features, and improvements as the
just-released regular Windows Server 2025. I must admit I’m a little
unclear as to what Windows Server IoT has to offer over the regular
edition, and reading the various Microsoft marketing materials and
documents don’t really make it any clearer for me either, since I’m not
particularly well-versed in all that enterprise networking lingo.</p>

the portable, lightweight, and robust UNIX-like operating system</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-04, from: OS News</p>
<p>NetBSD is an open-source, Unix-like operating system known for its
portability, lightweight design, and robustness across a wide array of
hardware platforms. Initially released in 1993, NetBSD was one of the
first open-source operating systems based on the Berkeley Software
Distribution (BSD) lineage, alongside FreeBSD and OpenBSD. NetBSD’s
development has been led by a collaborative community and is
particularly recognized for its “clean” and well-documented codebase, a
factor that has made it a popular choice among users interested in
systems programming and cross-platform compatibility. ↫ André Machado
I’m not really sure what to make of this article, since it mostly reads
like an advertisement for NetBSD, but considering NetBSD is one of the
lesser-talked about variants of an operating system family that already
sadly plays second fiddle to the Linux behemoth, I don’t think giving it
some additional attention is really hurting anybody. The article is
still gives a solid overview of the history and strengths of NetBSD,
which makes it a good introduction. I have personally never tried
NetBSD, but it’s on my list of systems to try out on my PA-RISC
workstation since from what I’ve heard it’s the only BSD which can
possibly load up X11 on the Visualize FX10pro graphics card it has
(OpenBSD can only boot to a console on this GPU). While I could probably
coax some cobbled-together Linux installation into booting X11 on it,
where’s the fun in that? Do any of you lovely readers use NetBSD for
anything? FreeBSD and even OpenBSD are quite well represented as general
purpose operating systems in the kinds of circles we all frequent, but I
rarely hear about people using NetBSD other than explicitly because it
supports some outdated, arcane architecture in 2024.</p>

<h2 id="redox-runs-on-risc-v-boots-to-gui-login-on-raspberry-pi-4">Redox
runs on RISC-V, boots to GUI login on Raspberry Pi 4</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-04, from: OS News</p>
<p>Another month lies behind us, so another monthly update from Redox is
upon us. The biggest piece of news this time is undoubtedly that Redox
now runs on RISC-V – a major achievement. Andrey Turkin has done
extensive work on RISC-V support in the kernel, toolchain and elsewhere.
Thanks very much Andrey for the excellent work! Jeremy Soller has
incorporated RISC-V support into the toolchain and build process, has
begun some refactoring of the kernel and device drivers to better handle
all the supported architectures, and has gotten the Orbital Desktop
working when running in QEMU. ↫ Ribbon and Ron Williams That’s not all,
though. Redox on the Raspberry Pi 4 boots to the GUI login screen, but
needs more work on especially USB support to become a fully usable
target. The application store from the COSMIC desktop environment has
been ported, and as part of this effort, Redox also adopted FreeDesktop
standards to make package installation easier – and it just makes sense
to do so, with more and more of COSMIC making its way to Redox. Of
course, there’s also a slew of smaller improvements to the kernel,
various drivers including the ACPI driver, RedoxFS, Relibc, and a lot
more. The progress Redox is making is astounding, and while that’s
partly because it’s easier to make progress when there’s a lot of
low-hanging fruit as there inevitably will be in a relatively new
operating system, it’s still quite an achievement. I feel very positive
about the future of Redox, and I can’t wait until it reaches a point
where more general purpose use becomes viable.</p>

<h2 id="windows-server-2025-released">Windows Server 2025 released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-04, from: OS News</p>
<p>Microsoft has confirmed the general availability of Windows Server
2025, which, as a long-term servicing channel (LTSC) release, will be
supported for almost ten years. This article describes some of the
newest developments in Windows Server 2025, which boasts advanced
features that improve security, performance, and flexibility. With
faster storage options and the ability to integrate with hybrid cloud
environments, managing your infrastructure is now more streamlined.
Windows Server 2025 builds on the strong foundation of its predecessor
while introducing a range of innovative enhancements to adapt to your
needs. ↫ What’s new in Windows Server 2025 article It should come as no
surprise that Windows Server 2025 comes loaded with a ton of new
features and improvements. I already covered some of those, such as
DTrace by default, NVMe and storage improvements, hotpatching, and more.
Other new features we haven’t discussed yet are a massive list of
changes and improvements to Active Directory, a feature-on-demand
feature for Azure Arc, support for Bluetooth keyboards, mice, and other
peripherals, and tons of Hyper-V improvements. SMB is also seeing so
many improvements it’s hard to pick just a few to highlight, and
software-defined networking is also touted as a major aspect of Server
2025. With SDN you can separate the network control plane from the data
plane, giving administrators more flexibility in managing their network.
I can just keep going listing all of the changes, but you get the idea –
there’s a lot here. You can try Windows Server 2025 for free for 180
days, as a VM in Azure, a local virtual machine image, or installed
locally through an ISO image.</p>

<p>Some months ago, I got really fed up with C. Like, I don’t hate C.
Hating programming languages is silly. But it was way too much effort to
do simple things like lists/hashmaps and other simple data structures
and such. I decided to try this language called Odin, which is one of
these “Better C” languages. And I ended up liking it so much that I
moved my game Artificial Rage from C to Odin. Since Odin has support for
Raylib too (like everything really), it was very easy to move things
around. Here’s how it all went.. Well, what I remember the very least. ↫
Akseli Lahtinen You programmers might’ve thought you escaped the wrath
of Monday on OSNews, but after putting the IT administrators to work in
my previous post, it’s now time for you to get to work. If you have a C
codebase and want to move it to something else, in this case Odin,
Lahtinen’s article will send you on your way. As someone who barely
knows how to write HTML, it’s difficult for me to say anything
meaningful about the technical details, but I feel like there’s a lot of
useful, first-hand info here.</p>

FreeBSD: story of a migration</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-04, from: OS News</p>
<p>It’s the start of the work week, so for the IT administrators among
us, I have another great article by friend of the website, Stefano
Marinelli. This article covers migrating a Proxmox-based setup to
FreeBSD with bhyve. The load is not particularly high, and the machines
have good performance. Suddenly, however, I received a notification: one
of the NVMe drives died abruptly, and the server rebooted. ZFS did its
job, and everything remained sufficiently secure, but since it’s a
leased server and already several years old, I spoke with the client and
proposed getting more recent hardware and redoing the setup based on
a FreeBSD host. ↫ Stefano Marinelli If you’re interested in moving one
of your own setups, or one of your clients’ setups, from Linux to
FreeBSD, this is a great place to start and get some ideas, tips, and
tricks. Like I said, it’s Monday, and you need to get to work.</p>

<p>It’s been less than a week, and late Friday night we reached the
fundraiser goal of €2500 (it sat at 102% when I closed it) on Ko-Fi! I’m
incredibly grateful for each and every donation, big or small, and every
new Patreon that joined our ranks. It’s incredible how many of you are
willing to support OSNews to keep it going, and it means the absolute
world to me. Hopefully we’ll eventually reach a point where monthly
Patreon income is high enough so we can turn off ads for everyone, and
be fully free from any outside dependencies. Of course, it’s not just
those that choose to support us financially – every reader matters, and
I’m very thankful for each and every one of you, donor/Patreon or not.
The weekend’s almost over, so back to regular posting business tomorrow.
I wish y’all an awesome Sunday evening.</p>
