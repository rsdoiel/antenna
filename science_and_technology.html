<p>A new lobbying group, dubbed the Freedom Cities Coalition, wants to
convince President Trump and Congress to authorize the creation of new
special development zones within the U.S. These zones would allow
wealthy investors to write their own laws and set up their own
governance structures which would be corporately controlled and wouldn’t
involve a traditional bureaucracy. The new zones could also serve as a
testbed for weird new technologies without the need for government
oversight. ↫ Lucas Ropek I mean, just in case you weren’t convinced yet
these people are utterly insane. This is the kind of nonsensical
libertarian Ayn Rand-inspired wank material dystopian fiction draws a

involved, especially not for the poor and lower classes inhabiting such
places, because they’re supposed to be warnings, not instruction
manuals. The fact that this insipid brand of utter stupidity is even
considered by a president of the United States in this day and age

<p>The future of the United States is no longer decided in Washington.
That ship has sailed. It’s now dictated in the bunkers, private jets,

wealth extremists intent on treating democracy as a nuisance that must
be swatted away. These men – raised on a rabid press that mythologized
their existence in their lifetimes, called them Wunderkind and treated
them as something above and beyond mere mortality – have consumed a
steady diet of libertarian and authoritarian fan fiction and conceived a
new order, designed to elevate their lofty egos at any and all cost. The
Internet was supposed to be the great equalizer. It was meant to be a
force that shattered hierarchies and gave power to ordinary people.
Instead, it enabled the wealth extraction and avarice of a cartel of
overfed, over-pampered despots who enriched themselves in the name of
innovation, bled the world to the point of near-total collapse,
intellectualized their power fetish and now view public institutions as
the final obstacles to be dismantled in their megalomanic pursuit of

triggers call for made-in-Europe tech</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-11, from: OS News</p>
<p>The utter chaos in the United States and the country’s antagonistic,
erratic, and often downright hostile approach to what used to be its
allies has not gone unnoticed, and it seems it’s finally creating some
urgency in an area in which people have been fruitlessly advocating for
urgency for years: digital independence from US tech giants. Efforts to
make Europe more technologically “sovereign” have gone mainstream. The
European Commission now has its first-ever “technology sovereignty”
chief, Henna Virkkunen. Germany’s incoming ruling party, the
center-right Christian Democratic Union, called for “sovereign” tech in
its program for the February election. “Mounting friction across the
Atlantic makes it clearer than ever that Europe must control its own
technological destiny,” said Francesca Bria, an innovation professor at
University College London and former president of Italy’s National
Innovation Fund. ↫ Pieter Haeck at Politico This should’ve been a
primary concern for decades, as many have been trying to make it. Those
calls usually fell on deaf ears, as relying on Google, Microsoft,
Amazon, and other US tech giants was simply the cheapest option for EU
governments and corporations alike. However, now that the US is
suffering under a deeply dysfunctional, anti-EU regime, the chickens are
coming home to roost, and it’s dawning on European politicians and
business leaders alike that relying on US corporations that openly and
brazenly cheer on the Trump/Elon regime might’ve been a bad idea. To the
surprise of nobody with more than two brain cells. It’s going to take a
long, long time for this situation to get any better. Europe simply
doesn’t have any equivalents to the services offered by companies like
Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, and even if does, certainly not at their
scale. Building up the resources these US companies offers is going to
take a long time, and it won’t be cheap, making it hard to sell such
moves to voters and shareholders alike, both of which are not exactly
known for their long-term views on such complex matters. Still, it seems
consumers in the EU might be more receptive to messages of digital
independence from the US than ever before. Just look at how hard Tesla
is tanking all over Europe, part of which can definitely be attributed
to Europeans not wanting to buy any products from a man openly insulting
and lying about European elected officials. If this groundswell of
sentiment spreads, I can definitely see European politicians tapping
into it to sell massive investments in digital independence. Personally,
banning Twitter and Facebook from operating in the EU should be step
one, as its owners have made it very clear that illegal election
interference and nazi propaganda is something they have no issues with,
followed by massive investments in alternatives to the services offered
by the US big tech companies. China has been doing this for a long time
now, and Europe should follow in its footsteps. There are enough bases
to work from – from open source non-Google Android smartphones to
EU-based Linux distributions for everything from desktops to server
farms, and countless other open source services – so it’s not like we
have to start from nothing. If we can spend €800 billion to finally get
EU defense up to snuff, we should be able to spare something for digital
independence, too.</p>

<p>date: 2025-03-11, from: OS News</p>
<p>To meet those goals, we’ve begun work on a native port of the
TypeScript compiler and tools. The native implementation will
drastically improve editor startup, reduce most build times by 10x, and
substantially reduce memory usage. By porting the current codebase, we
expect to be able to preview a native implementation of tsc capable of
command-line typechecking by mid-2025, with a feature-complete solution
for project builds and a language service by the end of the year. ↫
Anders Hejlsberg It seems Microsoft is porting TypeScript to Go, and
WILL eventually offer both “TypeScript (JS)” and “TypeScript (native)”
alongside one another during a transition period. TypeScript 6.x will be
the JavaScript-based one and will continue to be developed until
TypeScript 7.0, the Go-one, is mature enough. During the 6.x release
cycle, however, there will be breaking changes and deprecations in
preparation for 7.0. Those are some serious performance improvements,
but I’m sure quite a few projects are going to run into issues during
the transition period. I hope for them that the 6.x branch remains
maintained for long enough to reasonably get everyone on board the new
Go version.</p>

<p>On March 6, 1985, NASA’s newest space shuttle, Atlantis, made its
public debut during a rollout ceremony at the Rockwell International
manufacturing plant in Palmdale, California. Under construction for
three years, Atlantis joined NASA’s other three space-worthy orbiters,
Columbia, Challenger, and Discovery, and atmospheric test vehicle
Enterprise. Officials from NASA, Rockwell, and other organizations

the (discontinued) hybrid Debian GNU/kFreeBSD distribution</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>For decades, Linux and BSD have stood as two dominant yet
fundamentally different branches of the Unix-like operating system
world. While Linux distributions, such as Debian, Ubuntu, and Fedora,
have grown to dominate the open-source ecosystem, BSD-based systems like
FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and NetBSD have remained the preferred choice for
those seeking security, performance, and licensing flexibility. But what
if you could combine the best of both worlds—Debian’s vast package
ecosystem with FreeBSD’s robust and efficient kernel? Enter Debian
GNU/kFreeBSD, a unique experiment that merges Debian’s familiar userland
with the FreeBSD kernel, offering a hybrid system that takes advantage
of FreeBSD’s technical prowess while maintaining the ease of use
associated with Debian. This article dives into the world of Debian
GNU/kFreeBSD, exploring its architecture, installation, benefits,
challenges, and real-world applications. ↫ George Whittaker More of a
list of upsides and downsides than an actual in-depth article, but that
doesn’t make it any less interesting. There’s a variety of attempts out
there to somehow marry the Linux and BSD worlds, and each of them takes
a unique approach. I’m not sure the Debian userland with a FreeBSD
kernel is the way to go, though, and it seems I’m not alone – Debian
GNU/kFreeBSD was officially dropped from Debian in 2015 or so, and after
a flurry of unofficial activity in 2019, it was discontinued completely
in 2023 due to a lack of activity and developer interest. Odd that the
source article doesn’t mention that. If you’re still interested in a
combination of Linux and BSD, I’d keep an eye on Chimera Linux instead.
It’s very actively developed, focuses on portable code by supporting
many architectures, and its developers are veterans in this space. I
have my eye on Chimera Linux as my future distribution of choice.</p>

denies using firmware updates to brick printers with third-party
ink</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>Brother laser printers are popular recommendations for people seeking
a printer with none of the nonsense. By nonsense, we mean printers
suddenly bricking features, like scanning or printing, if users install
third-party cartridges. Some printer firms outright block third-party
toner and ink, despite customer blowback and lawsuits. Brother’s laser
printers have historically worked fine with non-Brother accessories. A
YouTube video posted this week, though, as well as older social media
posts, claim that Brother has gone to the dark side and degraded laser
printer functionality with third-party cartridges. Brother tells Ars
that this isn’t true. ↫ Scharon Harding at Ars Technica I find this an
incredibly interesting story. We all know the printer space is a cursed
hellhole of the very worst worst types of enshittification, but Brother
seemed like an island of relative calm in a sea of bullshit. In turn,
people are so used to printers being shit, that any problem that comes
up is automatically explained by malice, which is not entirely
unreasonable. Borther insists, though, that it does not break printers
using third-party toner or ink through firmware. Brother does make it
very clear that it is standard procedure to only perform troubleshooting
on Brother printers using ‘genuine’ Brother ink and toner, which is not
entirely unreasonable in my book. There’s no telling what kind of
effects third part cartridges – which do contain electronics – have on
the rest of the printer, and I don’t think it’s fair to expect Brother
to be able to document all of those possible issues. As long as using
third-party toner and ink cartridges doesn’t invalidate any warranties,
and as long as Brother doesn’t intentionally break printers for using
third-party toner and ink, I think Brother meets its obligations to
consumers. If you choose to use third-party ink and toner cartridges in
Brother printers, I think it’s only reasonable you remove those during
the troubleshooting process to ensure they’re not the cause of any
problems you’re experiencing.</p>
