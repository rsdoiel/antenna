<h2 id="windows-7-a-2025-perspective-rose-tinted-or-not">Windows 7: a
2025 perspective (rose-tinted or not)</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-08, from: OS News</p>
<p>Quite often, I wonder how much nostalgia plays part in our perception
of past events. Luckily, with software, you can go “back” and retest it,
and so there’s no need for any illusions and misconceptions. To wit, I
decided to reinstall and try Windows 7 again (as a virtual machine, but
still), to see whether my impressions of the dross we call “modern”
software today are justified. ↫ Igor Ljubuncic The conclusion is that,
yes, you can still get quite far today with Windows 7, and I honestly
don’t fault anyone for longing for those days. Windows 7 sits dead smack
in the middle between the dreadfulness of Windows XP and pre-patches
Vista on one extreme, and the ad-infested, “AI”-slop that are Windows 10
and 11. Its Aero look also happens to be experiencing somewhat of a
revival, with both Apple and Google borrowing heavily from it for their
latest software releases. Transparent blurred glass is making a
comeback, but I doubt the current crop of designers at Apple and Google
will be able to top just how nice Aero Glass looked in Windows 7. Still,
I don’t think you should be using an out-of-support version of Windows
for anything more than retrocomputing and as a curiosity, for obvious
reasons we’re all aware of. With the end of support for Windows 10 –
still used by two-thirds of Window users – approaching quickly, a lot of
people are going to have to make the same choice that fans of Windows 7
made years ago: keep using what I like, risks and all, or move on to
what I don’t like, but is at least maintained and supported? That is,
assuming you can even make that choice in the first place, since in the
current economic uncertainty, most definitely cannot. Maybe the Windows
world will dodge a bullet, and the circumstances force Microsoft to
extend support for Windows 10, like they did with Office applications.
Let’s see if they blink, again.</p>
