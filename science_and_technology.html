<h2 id="running-linux-or-netbsd-on-the-amiga-4000">Running Linux or
NetBSD on the Amiga 4000</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-18, from: OS News</p>
<p>In this blog post, I have described how I have been using Linux on my
Amiga 4000. I hope this information can be of use to anyone who is
planning to run Linux on their Amigas. Furthermore, I hope that the
existing documentation on the Linux/m68k homepage gets updated at some
point. May be the information in this blog post can help with that.
Debian 3.1 works decently for me, but everything is much slower compared
to a PC. This is not really surprising if you run an operating system
(last updated in 2008) on a CPU from the early 90s that still runs at a
25 MHz clock speed :). ↫ Sander van der Burg The blog post in question
is from January of this year, but as soon as I saw it I knew I had to
post it here. It’s an incredibly intricate and detailed guide to running
Linux on a 25Mhz Amiga 4000, including X11, networking, internet access,
file sharing, and so, so much more – up to running Linux for Amiga
inside FS-UAE. There’s so much love and dedication in this detailed
guide, and I love it. In fact, Van den Burg has a similar article about
running NetBSD on the Amiga 4000, with the same level of detail,
dedication, and information density. A fun note is that while X11 for
Linux on the Amiga can’t seem to make use of the Amiga chipset, the X
Window System on NetBSD does make us of it. I’m not surprised. Articles
like these are useful only for a very small number of people, but having
this amount of knowledge concentrated like this will prove invaluable
like five years from now when someone else finds an Amiga 4000 in their
attic or at a yard sale, and choose to go down this same path. We need
more of these kinds of write-ups.</p>

id="when-root-meets-immutable-openbsd-chflags-vs.-log-tampering">When
root meets immutable: OpenBSD chflags vs. log tampering</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-18, from: OS News</p>
<p>ISO 27001 is like that careful lawyer who never says exactly what
they mean – it tells you what needs to be achieved, not how to do it.
When it comes to logging, this is particularly telling: Control A.12.4.2
simply states that “logging information and logging facilities shall be
protected against tampering and unauthorized access.” Period. How?
That’s your problem to solve. ↫ Rafael Sadowski It turns out OpenBSD has
a few relatively simple tools to make logs immutable, in a way that not
even root can delete or modify them, or change any of the logging
schedules. Reading through the blog post, you don’t even need a ton of
intricate knowledge to set this up, thanks mostly to just how much
innate sense OpenBSD tends to make, and how excellent the documentation
is. I have no need for this level of security, but if you do, you can
set this up in a few minutes.</p>

<p>date: 2025-07-18, from: OS News</p>
<p>With both Exchange 2016 and 2019 going out of support in October
2025, we have heard from some of our customers that they have started
their migrations to Exchange Subscription Edition (SE) but might need a
few extra months of Security Updates (SU) for their Exchange 2016 / 2019
servers while they are finalizing their migrations. We are announcing
that we now have a solution for such customers. Starting on August 1st,
2025, customers can contact their Microsoft account team to get
information about and purchase an additional 6-month Extended Security
Update (ESU) for their Exchange 2016 / 2019 servers. Your account teams
will have information related to per server cost and additional details
on how to purchase and receive ESUs, starting August 1st, 2025. ↫ The
Exchange Team blog Microsoft is clearly in a place where a lot of their
software released over the past ten years or so just kind of works, and
people just don’t feel as strong of a need to upgrade to newer versions,
especially not if those newer versions come with complex subscriptions.
It must be a strange position to be in for Microsoft.</p>

<h2 id="tilck-a-tiny-linux-compatible-kernel">Tilck: a tiny
Linux-compatible kernel</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>Tilck is an educational monolithic kernel designed to be
Linux-compatible at binary level. It runs on i686 and RISCV64 at the
moment. Project’s small-scale and simple design makes it the perfect
playground for playing in kernel mode while retaining the ability to
compare how the very same usermode bits run on the Linux kernel as well.
That’s a rare feature in the realm of educational kernels. Because of
that, building a program for Tilck requires just a gcc-musl toolchain
from bootlin.com. Tilck has no need to have its own set of custom
written applications, like most educational kernels do. It just runs
mainstream Linux programs like the BusyBox suite. While the
Linux-compatibility and the monolithic design might seem a limitation
from the OS research point of view, on the other side, such design bring
the whole project much closer to real-world applications in the future,
compared to the case where some serious (or huge) effort is required to
port pre-existing software on it. Also, nothing stops Tilck from
implementing custom non-Linux syscalls that aware apps might take
advantage of. ↫ Tilck GitHub page Tilck implements about 100 Linux
syscalls, and is not focused on replacing the Linux kernel or even
becoming a generic desktop or server operating system. It supports both
i686 and RISC-V, has support for FAT, and a whole slew of other
features. It can run a number of console and even a few framebuffer
applications, but don’t expect things like X11 to work, or to ever
work.</p>

<p>date: 2025-07-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>Do you have a Windows XP retro virtual machine or, god forbid, run
Windows XP on your primary machine? You’re going to need a sort-of
up-to-date browser, and it turns out Mypal68 offers just that. Terrible
name aside, it’s Firefox 68 ported to and maintained to run on Windows
XP SP3; SP2 and lower are not supported, but some people do seem to have
some success getting it to run on those. There are issues, of course:
there’s a 1.5GB memory limit, and the browser will crash when it reaches
that limit, and 64bit builds simpy don’t work at all, so there’s only a
32bit build. Version 74.1.0 was released a few days ago, but that
version number doesn’t actually mean the browser is now based on Firefox
74; they had to change the reported version number for extension
compatibility. I’m currently setting up a dedicated Proxmox PC for retro
virtual machines, and Windows XP will obviously be one of them. I’m
definitely going to try this out.</p>

id="review-the-novacustom-v54-is-an-outstanding-linux-laptop-with-dasharo-coreboot-firmware">Review:
the NovaCustom V54 is an outstanding Linux laptop with Dasharo coreboot
firmware</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>When it comes to open hardware, choices are not exactly abundant.
Truly open source hardware – open down to the firmware level of
individual components – that also has acceptable performance is rare,
with one of the few options being the Talos II and Blackbird POWER9
workstations from Raptor Computing Systems (which I reviewed). Another
option that can be fully open source with the right configuration are
the laptops made by MNT, which use the ARM architecture (which I also
reviewed). Both of these are excellent options, but they do come with
downsides; the Talos II/Blackbird are expensive and getting a bit long
in the tooth (and a possible replacement is at least a year away), and
the MNT Reform and Pocket Reform simply aren’t for everyone due to their
unique and opinionated design. Using an architecture other than x86 also
simply isn’t an option for a lot of people, ruling out POWER9 and ARM
hardware entirely. In the x86 world, it’s effectively impossible to
avoid proprietary firmware blobs, but there are companies out there
trying to build x86 laptops that try to at least minimise the reliance
on such unwelcome blobs. One of these companies is NovaCustom, a Dutch
laptop (and now desktop!) OEM that sells x86 computers that come with
Dasharo open firmware (based on coreboot) and a strong focus on privacy,
open source, customisability, and repairability. NovaCustom sent over a
fully configured NovaCustom V54 laptop, so let’s dive into what it’s
like to configure and use an x86 laptop with Dasharo open firmware and a
ton of unique customisation options. Hardware configuration I opted for
the 14″ laptop model, the V54, since the 16″ V65 is just too large for
my taste. NovaCustom offers a choice between a 1920×1200 60Hz and a
2880×1800 120Hz panel, and I unsurprisingly chose the latter. This
higher-DPI panel strikes a perfect balance between having a 4K panel,
which takes a lot more processing power to drive, and a basic 1080p
panel, which I find unacceptable on anything larger than 9″ or so. The
refresh rate of 120Hz is also a must on any modern display, as anything
lower looks choppy to my eyes (I’m used to 1440p/280Hz on my gaming PC,
and 4K/160Hz on my workstation – I’m spoiled). The display also gets
plenty bright, but disappointingly, the V54 does not offer a touch
option. I don’t miss it, but I know it’s a popular feature, so be
advised. While the V54 can be equipped with a dedicated mobile RTX 4060
or 4070 GPU, I have no need for such graphical power in a laptop, so I
stuck with the integrated Intel Arc GPU. Note that if you do go for the
dedicated GPU, you’ll lose the second M.2 slot, and the laptop will gain
some weight and thickness. I did opt for the more powerful CPU option
with the Intel Intel Core Ultra 7 155H, which packs 6 performance cores
(with hyperthreading), 8 efficiency cores, and 2 low-power cores, for a
total of 16 cores and 22 threads maxing out at 4.8Ghz. Unless you intend
to do GPU-intensive work, this combination is stupid fast and
ridiculously powerful. Throw in the 32GB of DDR5 5600MHz RAM in a
dual-channel configuration (2×16, replaceable) and a speedy 7.400 MB/s
(read)/6.500 MB/s (write) 1TB SSD, and I sometimes feel like this is the
sort of opulence Marie Antoinette would indulge herself in if she were
alive today. It won’t surprise you to learn that with this
configuration, you won’t be experiencing any slowdowns, stuttering, or
other performance issues. Ports-wise, the V54 has a USB-C port (3.2 Gen
2), a Thunderbolt 4 port (with Display Alt Mode supporting DP 2.1), a
USB-A port (3.2 Gen 2) and a barrel power jack on the right side, a
combo audio jack, USB-A port (3.2 Gen 1), microSD card slot, and a
Kensington lock on the left, and an Ethernet and HDMI port on the back.
Especially the Ethernet port is such a welcome affordance in this day
and age, and we’ll get back to it since we need it for Dasharo. The
trackpad is large, smooth, and pleasant to use – for a diving board type
trackpad, that is. More and more manufacturers are adopting the
Apple-style haptic trackpads, which I greatly prefer, but I suspect
there might be some patent and IP shenanigans going on that explain why
uptake of those in the PC space hasn’t exactly been universal. If you’re
coming from a diving board trackpad, you’ll love this one. If you’re
coming from a haptic trackpad, it’s a bit of a step down. A standout on
the V54 is the keyboard. The keys are perfectly spaced, have excellent
travel, a satisfying, silent click, and they are very stable. It’s an
absolute joy to type on, and about as good as a laptop keyboard can be.
On top of that, at least when you opt for the US-international keyboard
layout like I do, you get a keyboard that actually properly lists the
variety of special characters on its keys. This may look chaotic and
messy to people who don’t need to use those special characters, but as
someone who does, this is such a breath of fresh air compared to all
those modern, minimalist keyboards where you end up randomly mashing key
combinations to find that one special character you need. Considering my
native Dutch uses diacritics, and my wife’s native Swedish uses the
extra letters å, ä, and ö (they’re letters!), this is such a great
touch. The keyboard also has an additional layer for a numeric pad, as
well as the usual set of function keys you need on a modern laptop,
including a key that will max out the fan speed in case you need it (the
little fan glyph on my keyboard seems double-printed, though, which is a
small demerit). I especially like the angry moon glyph on the sleep key.
He’s my grumpy friend and I love him. Of course, the</p>

<p>Did you know KDE has a television-focused user interface? It’s been
languishing for a while now, but a recent week-long effort by KDE
developer Devin has brought a lot of new life into the project. I have
been a long time Plasma Mobile contributor, but I have always had a keen
interest in having Linux on my TV! I have noticed that in the past few
months, the Plasma Bigscreen project has had some interest from people
wanting to contribute, but there have not been any active KDE developers
working on the project. Since I have some time off school (having just
graduated university), I decided to take a swing at improving the
project for a week. ↫ Devin, KDE developer It turned out to be one hell
of a productive week, because the list of improvements achieved in that
one week is kind of amazing. Lots of overhauls of the visual design, a
new search view, complete redesign of the settings panels, and a lot
more. The idea of running a KDE Plasma-based interface on my TVs sounds
incredibly appealing, and I hope the project can make even more
progress.</p>

<p>date: 2025-07-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>Haiku also survived another month of development, so it’s time for
another roundup of what they’ve been doing. Considering it’s the height
of Summer, it’s no surprise the list of changes is a bit shorter,
consisting mostly of smaller bugfixes and minor improvements. A few
standout changes are that cursors can now be properly scaled in HiDPI,
the iprowifi3945 driver from FreeBSD has been replaced by the OpenBSD
one because it performs better, and several improvements to how colour
schemes work. waddlesplash refactored how control edge (borders, etc.)
colors are computed inside HaikuControlLook (the class that renders UI
controls under the default appearance), cleaning up a lot of convoluted
computations. He also fixed some color handling in the progress bar
control, and then along with nephele, refactored how control colors are
used and computed across the system. The “Control background” color in
Appearance preferences now has a new default and is much more properly
used across the Interface Kit; under the default colors, renderings
should be basically the same as before, but for users on “dark mode” or
other custom color schemes, it will now be much easier to pick control
colors. ↫ waddlesplash on the Haiku website There’s more, of course, so
be sure to read the whole thing.</p>

5.0 to introduce HDR support for Wayland on Linux, but not for
Windows</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-14, from: OS News</p>
<p>The latest alpha of the upcoming Blender 5.0 release comes with High
Dynamic Range (HDR) support for Linux on Wayland which will, if
everything works out, make it into the final Blender 5.0 release on
October 1, 2025. The post on the developer forum comes with instructions
on how to enable the experimental support and how to test it. If you are
using Fedora Workstation 42, which ships GNOME version 48, everything is
already included to run Blender with HDR. All that is required is an HDR
compatible display and graphics driver, and turning on HDR in the
Display Settings. ↫ Sebastian Wick It’s interesting to note that Blender
on Windows won’t be getting HDR support, and that’s because Windows’ HDR
support is subpar compared to Wayland on Linux, and requires a ton more
work which the Blender team isn’t going to do. It seems the Wayland
developers made all the right choices when it comes to HDR support.
Needless to say, X11 doesn’t have HDR support. The design of the Wayland
color-management protocol, and the resulting active color-management
paradigm of Wayland compositors was a good choice, making it easy for
developers to do the right thing, while also giving them more control if
they so chose. ↫ Sebastian Wick Weird. I was told Wayland was an
unusable mess.</p>

<p>date: 2025-07-14, from: OS News</p>
<p>On Windows, there’s an option to show the seconds on the taskbar
clock, but it comes with a warning that it might reduce battery life if
you switch it on. LTT Labs decided to look into this to see just how
much of a thing this really is, and they concluded that yes, it does
actually affect battery life. They saw a drop of about 5%-15%, depending
on configuration. In percentage terms, the drops weren’t massive. For
most people, it probably won’t make or break your day. But if you’re on
a long flight, running low on battery, or trying to squeeze out every
last bit of endurance, it’s not entirely nothing either. ↫ Woolly Door
at LTT Labs I mean, having the second tick away on the click would drive
me up the wall when I’m trying to use my computer, but I’m sure quite a
few among you do enable the seconds display on your own setups (Windows
or otherwise). I’m curious to see if the same battery life reduction is
measurable on KDE, GNOME, or macOS.</p>

tool to stop “AI” crawler abuse, gains non-JavaScript option</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-14, from: OS News</p>
<p>In recent weeks and months, you may have noticed that when accessing
some websites, you see a little progress bar and a character, performing
some sort of check. You’ve most likely encountered Anubis, a tool to
distinguish real human browser users from “AI” content crawlers that are
causing real damage and harm. It turns out Anubis is quite effective at
what it does, but it did come with a limitation: it required JavaScript
to be enabled. Well, no more. One of the first issues in Anubis before
it was moved to the TecharoHQ org was a request to support challenging
browsers without using JavaScript. This is a pretty challenging thing to
do without rethinking how Anubis works from a fundamentally low level,
and with v1.20.0, Anubis finally has support for running without
client-side JavaScript thanks to the Meta Refresh challenge. ↫ Xe Iaso
Before this new non-JS challenge, users who disabled client-side
JavaScript or browsers which don’t support JavaScript were straight-up
blocked from passing Anubis’ test, meaning they couldn’t access the
website Anubis was protecting from “AI” scraper abuse. This is now no
longer the case.</p>
