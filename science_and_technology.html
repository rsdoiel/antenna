id="microsoft-were-not-lowering-the-windows-11-system-requirements">Microsoft:
we’re not lowering the Windows 11 system requirements</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-04, from: OS News</p>
<p>If you were secretly hoping Microsoft would lower the system
requirements for Windows 11 so you could upgrade your or your family’s
Windows 10 machines to Windows 11, you’re going to be in for some bad
news. In a blog post, Microsoft detailed that its most stringent Windows
11 requirement – the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0 – is here to stay
and crucial to the future of Windows. By instituting TPM 2.0 as a
non-negotiable standard for the future of Windows, we elevate the
security benchmark. It allows you and us to better align with the
growing need for formidable data protection in the modern digital
sphere. In conclusion, TPM 2.0 is not just a recommendation—it’s a
necessity for maintaining a secure and future-proof IT environment with
Windows 11. And it’s an important part of the larger Zero Trust
strategy, alongside Secure Boot, Credential Guard, and Windows Hello for
Business. ↫ Steven Hosking at the Windows IT Pro Blog So no, if you had
the hope Microsoft would lower Windows 11’s system requirements in the
face of the oncoming end of support deadline for the 60% of Windows
users still using Windows 10, your hope has just been dashed. A more
likely outcome here is that as the deadline grows closer, Microsoft will
extend the deadline by another year, and if needed another, because
leaving 60% of users without security updates and little to no path to
upgrade is not going to be a good look for the marketing and legal
departments. If you really do want to upgrade to Windows 11, there’s a
few options. There’s the enterprise-focused Windows 11 LTSC 2024
release, which does not require a TPM 2.0, regarding it as an optional
feature instead. On top of that, LTSC is much more bare-bones, shipping
without much of the stuff many of us more nerdy users aren’t interested
in anyway. The big downside is that getting your hands on a legal copy
of LTSC will be difficult, as it’s only available to volume licensing
customers, which you most likely are not. Of course, you shouldn’t give
a shit about Microsoft’s rules, so you can always use unapproved methods
of getting a license. Another option is the one I took for my parts-bin
Windows 11 PC which I only use for League of Legends: I bought a cheap
TPM 2.0 module from eBay, slotted it into my motherboard, and was on my
merry way. Due to League of Legends’ required rootkit, a TPM 2.0 module
is needed, so a few euros and days waiting later, I was ready to go. Do
make sure you get the right type of TPM 2.0 module for your motherboard,
as they’re not universally compatible. The final option is to use one of
the few remaining ways to circumvent Windows 11’s system requirements,
which are sadly dwindling with every major update. Right now that means
using a tool like Flyby11, which uses the Windows Server installer to
bypass Windows 11’s system requirements. We’ll have to wait and see for
how long that trick remains possible.</p>

<h2 id="convert-ntfs-to-btrfs-and-boot-windows-off-btrfs">Convert NTFS
to Btrfs and boot Windows off Btrfs</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>Ntfs2btrfs is a tool which does in-place conversion of Microsoft’s
NTFS filesystem to the open-source filesystem Btrfs, much
as btrfs-convert does for ext2. The original image is saved as a reflink
copy at image/ntfs.img, and if you want to keep the conversion you can
delete this to free up space. ↫ Mark Harmstone An amazing piece of
software that works on both Linux and Windows, and even, as described
above, comes with the option of undoing the conversion if you so desire
and haven’t removed the original image yet. Its developer, Mark
Harmstone, of course stresses that while he thinks the tool is quite
stable, he obviously makes no guarantees or claims about its stability.
In other words, please don’t use this on sensitive data or in a
production environment. What makes this tool even more amazing is that
you can combine it with two of Harmstone’s other tools to really pull
some rabbits out of your hat. First, there’s his Btrfs driver for
Windows, which, as the name implies, allows Windows to work with
Btrfs-formatted drives. Second, and here’s where things get really
spicy, there’s Quibble, his custom bootloader consisting of open source
reimplementations of Windows’ own bootloader. Using these three tools
together you can, if you’re lucky, boot and run Windows off a Btrfs
drive. That’s quite cool, and while perhaps not particularly useful due
to its experimental nature, it’s still an awesome weekend project.</p>

id="intel-board-kicks-out-ceo-launches-new-budget-desktop-gpus">Intel
board kicks out CEO, launches new budget desktop GPUs</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>This is a bit of an odd few days for Intel. Mere days after the board
ousted its CEO Pat Gelsinger, once heralded as the chip giant’s messiah,
they’re today launching two brand new desktop graphics cards. They’re
aimed at the more budget-oriented consumer, and might very well be the
last discrete graphics cards Intel makes, since this is one of the
product lines on the chopping block. Intel’s next — and possibly last —
desktop graphics cards will begin arriving in just 10 days. Right on
cue, the company has announced the budget $249 Arc B580 and $219 Arc
B570, shipping December 13th and January 16th, respectively, as the
“best-in-class performance per dollar” options in the GPU market.
They’re based on the same Xe2 “Battlemage” GPU architecture you’ll find
in Intel’s Lunar Lake laptop chips but with more than double the
graphics cores, up to 12GB of dedicated video memory, and up to 190W of
power compared to their limited laptop forms — enough power to see the
B580 slightly beat Nvidia’s $299 RTX 4060 and AMD’s $269 RX 7600,
according to Intel’s benchmarks, but sometimes still trading blows. ↫
Sean Hollister at The Verge As for Gelsinger’s dismissal, it seems the
board forced him out after being frustrated with the slow progress the
company was making in its turnaround. The fact that a finance person and
a marketing person will together be interim CEOs seems to indicate the
board is more interested in quick profit than a long-term turnaround,
and with companies like Qualcomm being interested in acquiring Intel,
the board’s short-term mentality might be winning out, and ousting
Gelsinger is just paving the way for selling off parts of Intel until
there’s nothing left. Who knows, I might be reading way too much into
all of this, but it feels like expecting an organisation as complex as a
high-end processor makers to turn itself around in just a few years is
incredibly shortsighted, and you’d think board members at Intel would
understand that. If the goal is to maintain Intel as a separate,
profitable entity making some of the world’s fastest processors, you’re
going to need to give a CEO and leadership team more than just a few
years to turn the ship around. Within a few years we’ll know the board’s
true intentions, but I wouldn’t be surprised to see Intel being sold for
parts over the coming years.</p>

<p>Rejecting an engrained practice of bullshitting does not come easily.
Frameworkism preaches that the way to improve user experiences is to
adopt more (or different) tooling from the framework’s ecosystem. This
provides adherents with something to do that looks plausibly like
engineering, except it isn’t. It can even become a totalising
commitment; solutions to user problems outside the framework’s expanded
cinematic universe are unavailable to the frameworkist. Non-idiomatic
patterns that unlock significant wins for users are bugs to be squashed.
And without data or evidence to counterbalance bullshit artists’s
assertions, who’s to say they’re wrong? Orthodoxy unmoored from
measurements of user outcomes predictably spins into abstruse
absurdities. Heresy, eventually, is perceived to carry heavy sanctions.
It’s all nonsense. ↫ Alex Russell I’m not a developer, but any
application that uses frameworks like React that I’ve ever used tend to
be absolute trainwrecks when it comes to performance, usability,
consistency, and platform integration. When someone claims to have an
application available for a platform I use, but it’s using React or
Electron or whatever, they’re lying in my eyes – what they really have
is a website running in a window frame, which may or may not even be a
native window frame. Developing using these tools indicates to me a lack
of care, a lack of respect for the users of your product. I am
militantly native. I’d rather use a less functional application than a
Chrome web application cosplaying as a real application, and I will most
likely not even consider using your service if all you have is a
website-in-a-box. If you don’t respect me, I see no need to respect you.
If you want an application on a specific platform, use that platform’s
native tools and APIs to build it. Anything else tells me all I need to
know about how much you truly care about the product you’re
building.</p>

Hall SC-VGA-2 video processor, the Atari ST and NeXTSTEP: more tales of
the unscreenshotable</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-02, from: OS News</p>
<p>This is the Hall Research Technologies SC-VGA-2, sold as a “VGA/HDTV
Video Processor.” In addition to slicing, dicing and pureeing,
apparently, it will take any of a bundle of input formats and both
rescale and resample them on the fly into the VGA or HDTV signal you
desire, including 60Hz rates. This came from a seller specializing in
teleprompter equipment and Hall still sells an HDMI version with
additional resolutions … for around US$500. However, this or the
slightly newer SC-VGA-2A and SC-VGA-2B are all relatively common devices
and found substantially cheaper used. Let’s try it out and show some
sample output, including those delicious NeXTSTEP system messages and
some ST grabs. ↫ Cameron Kaiser With the obscurity of some of the
hardware Cameron Kaiser details on his website, I’m not surprised he has
some seriously unique needs when it comes to taking screengrabs. He
couldn’t very well not take the device apart, and inside it appears to
be a system with two small processors, at least one of which is an Intel
8051 8bit microcontroller. Kaiser goes into his usual great detail
explaining and showing how the device works. If you’ve got unique
screengrabbing needs, this might be of interest to you.</p>
