<h2 id="apples-macos-unix-certification-is-a-lie">Apple’s macOS UNIX
certification is a lie</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-29, from: OS News</p>
<p>As an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a someone
mentioning macOS is a UNIX approaches 1. In fact, it was only late last
year that The Open Group announced that macOS 15.0 was, once again,
certified as UNIX, continuing Apple’s long-standing tradition of
certifying macOS releases as “real” UNIX®. What does any of this
actually, mean, though? Well, it turns out that if you actually dive
into Apple’s conformance statements for macOS’ UNIX certification, it
doesn’t really mean anything at all. First and foremost, we have to
understand what UNIX certification really means. In order to be allowed
to use the UNIX trademark, your operating system needs to comply with
the Single UNIX Specification (SUS), which specifies programming
interfaces for C, a command-line shell, and user commands, more or less
identical to POSIX, as well as the X/Open Curses specification. The
latest version is SUS version 4, originally published in 2008, with
amendments published in 2013 and 2016, which were rolled up into version
4 in 2018. The various versions of the SUS that exist, in turn,
correspond to a specific UNIX trademark. In table form: Trademark SUS
version SUS published in: SUS last amended in: UNIX® 93 n.a. n.a. n.a.
UNIX® 95 Version 1 1994 n.a. UNIX® 98 Version 2 1997 n.a. UNIX® 03
Version 3 2002 2004 UNIX® V7 Version 4 2008 2016 (2018 for roll-up) When
you read that macOS is a certified UNIX, which of these versions and
trademarks do you assume macOS complies with? You’d assume they would
just target the latest trademark and SUS version, right? This would
allow macOS to carry the UNIX® V7 trademark, because they would conform
to version 4 of the SUS, which dates to 2016. The real answer is that
macOS 15.0 only conforms to version 3 of the SUS, which dates all the
way back to the ancient times of 2004, and as such, macOS is only UNIX®
03 (on both Intel and ARM). However, you can argue this is just
semantics, since it’s not like UNIX and POSIX are very inclined to
change. So now, like the UNIX nerd that you are, you want to see all
this for yourself. You use macOS, safe in the knowledge that unlike
those peasants using Linux or one of the BSDs, you’re using a real
UNIX®. So you can just download all the tests suites (if you can afford
them, but that’s a whole different can of worms) and run them,
replicating Apple’s compliance testing, seeing for yourself, on your own
macOS 15 installation, that macOS 15 is a real UNIX®, right? Well, no,
you can’t, because the version of macOS 15 Apple certifies is not the
version that’s running on everyone’s supported Macs. To gain its
much-vaunted UNIX certification for macOS, Apple cheats. A lot. The
various documents Apple needs to submit to The Open Group as part of the
UNIX certification process are freely available, and mostly it’s a lot
of very technical questions about various very specific aspects of
macOS’ UNIX and POSIX compliance few of us would be able to corroborate
without extensive research and in-depth knowledge of macOS, UNIX, and
POSIX. However, at the end of every one of these Conformance Statements,
there’s a text field where the applicant can write down “additional,
explanatory material that was provided by the vendor”, and it’s in these
appendices where we can see just how much Apple has to cheat to ensure
macOS passes the various UNIX® 03 certification tests. In the first of
these four documents, Internationalised System Calls and Libraries
Extended V3, Apple’s “additional, explanatory material” reads as
follows: Question 27: By default, core file generation is not enabled.
To enable core file generation, you can issue this command: sudo
launchctl limit core unlimited Testing Environment Addendum: macOS
version 15.0 Sequoia, like previous versions, includes an additional
security mechanism known as System Integrity Protection (SIP). This
security policy applies to every running process, including privileged
code and code that runs out of the sandbox. The policy extends
additional protections to components on disk and at run-time, only
allowing system binaries to be modified by the system installer and
software updates. Code injection and runtime attachments to system
binaries are no longer permitted. To run the VSX conformance test suite
we first disable SIP as follows: – Shut down the system.– Press and hold
the power button. Keep holding it while you see the Apple logo and the
message “Continue holding for startup options”– Release the power button
when you see “Loading startup options”– Choose “Options” and click
“Continue”– Select an administrator account and enter its password.–
From the Utilities menu in the Menu Bar, select Terminal.– At the
prompt, issue the following command: “csrutil disable”– You should see a
message that SIP is disabled. From the Apple menu, select “Restart”. By
default, macOS coalesces timeouts that are scheduled to occur within 5
seconds of each other. This can randomly cause some sleep calls to sleep
for different times than requested (which affects tests of file access
times) so we disable this coalescing when testing. To disable timeout
coalescing issue this command: sudo sysctl -w
kern.timer.coalescing_enabled=0 By default there is no root user. We
enable the root user for testing using the following series of steps:–
Launch the Directory Utility by pressing Command and Space, and then
typing “Directory Utility”– Click the Lock icon in Directory Utility and
authenticate by entering an Administrator username and password.– From
the Menu Bar in Directory Utility:– Choose Edit -&gt; Enable Root User.
Then enter a password for the root user, and confirm it.– Note: If you
choose, you can later Disable Root User via the same menu. ↫ Apple’s
appendix to Internationalised System Calls and Libraries Extended V3 The
second conformance statement, Commands and Utilities V4, has another
appendix, and it’s a real doozy (the indicate repeat remarks from the
previous appendix; I’ve removed them for brevity): Testing Environment
Addendum: The third and fourth conformance statements have</p>

6.14 with Rust: “We are almost at the ‘write a real driver in Rust’
stage now”</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-29, from: OS News</p>
<p>With the Linux 6.13 kernel, Greg Kroah-Hartman described the level of
Rust support as a “tipping point” for Rust drivers with more of the Rust
infrastructure having been merged. Now for the Linux 6.14 kernel, Greg
describes the state of the Rust driver possibilities as “almost at the
“write a real driver in rust” stage now, depending on what you want to
do.“ ↫ Michael Larabel Excellent news, as there’s a lot of interest in
Rust, and it seems that allowing developers to write drivers for Linux
in Rust will make at least some new and upcoming drivers comes with less
memory safety issues than non-Rust drivers. I’m also quite sure this
will anger absolutely nobody.</p>

<p>OpenAI says it has found evidence that Chinese artificial

potential breach of intellectual property. ↫ Cristina Criddle and
Eleanor Olcott for the FT This is more ironic than writing a song called
Ironic that lists situations that aren’t actually ironic. OpenAI claims
it’s free to suck up whatever content and data it can find on the web

when someone takes whatever they regurgitate for their own use without

cowards</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>Google, on its Google Maps naming policy, back in 2008: By saying
“common”, we mean to include names which are in widespread daily use,
rather than giving immediate recognition to any arbitrary governmental
re-naming. In other words, if a ruler announced that henceforth the
Pacific Ocean would be named after her mother, we would not add that
placemark unless and until the name came into common usage. Google,
today, in 2025: Google has confirmed that Google Maps will soon rename
the Gulf of Mexico and Denali mountain in Alaska as the “Gulf of
America” and “Mount McKinley” in line with changes implemented by the
Trump Administration, but users in the rest of the world may see two
names for these locations. Nothing is worth less than the word of a
corporation.</p>

is the ability to play simple music through the PC speaker, and back in
the day, I remember that the format “ZZM” existed, so you could enjoy
the square wave tunes outside of the games. But imagine my surprise in
2025 to find that, while the Museum of ZZT does have a ZZM Audio
section, it recommends that nobody use the format anymore; because
nobody’s made a player that doesn’t require MS-DOS. Let’s fix that by
making a player with way higher system requirements, using everyone’s
favorite coding environment: Javascript. ↫ Nicole Branagan ZZM’s history
and Branagan’s journey to make this work without having to rely on DOS
took a lot more work than I expected, and is quite interesting, too.
Very niche, for sure, but that’s kind of what we’re here for.</p>

invalid 68030 instruction that accidentally allowed the Mac Classic II
to successfully boot up</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>A bug in the ROM for the Macintosh II was recently discovered that
causes a crash when booting in 32-bit mode. Doug Brown discovered and
documented the bug while playing with the MAME debugger. Why did it
never show up before? It seems a quirk in Motorola’s 68030 CPU
inadvertently fixes it when executing an illegal instruction that
shouldn’t have been executed in the first place. What follows is his
process for investigating the room on emulated hardware, and then
testing it on actual hardware.</p>

Those are all valuable areas of effort that can contribute to achieving extended flight, but Albatross approaches the problem from a new angle and seeks to develop weather forecast-informed mission planning and real-time onboard sensing of dynamic wind conditions across multiple environments to harness energy from winds to offset the total power of the system required for flight.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This additional energy harvested from the wind reduces average power and allows the system to fly farther and longer. Aircraft soaring capabilities can be summarized as the active harnessing of energy from the natural environment’s atmospheric flow field to reduce the onboard power demand to enable increased range and endurance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Albatross is &lt;strong&gt;not &lt;/strong&gt;a dedicated airframe or aircraft design effort.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program is not focused on lowering the drag of the airframe or providing the highest energy density source. Rather, the focus is on developing and integrating planning tools, additional aircraft sensors, and unique control solutions applied to existing or otherwise quickly assembled small uncrewed aircraft to autonomously plan for, identify and respond to soaring conditions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Success is defined as capitalizing on soaring conditions to extend range and endurance in an operationally relevant manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

id="pebbleos-becomes-open-source-new-pebble-device-announced">PebbleOS
becomes open source, new Pebble device announced</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-27, from: OS News</p>
<p>Eric Migicovsky, founder of Pebble, the original smartwatch maker,
made a major announcement today together with Google. Pebble was
originally bought by Fitbit and in turn Fitbit was then bought by
Google, but Migicovsky always wanted to to go back to his original idea
and create a brand new smartwatch. PebbleOS took dozens of engineers
working over 4 years to build, alongside our fantastic product and QA
teams. Reproducing that for new hardware would take a long time.
Instead, we took a more direct route – I asked friends at Google (which
bought Fitbit, which had bought Pebble’s IP) if they could open source
PebbleOS. They said yes! Over the last year, a team inside Google
(including some amazing ex-Pebblers turned Googlers) has been working on
this. And today is the day – the source code for PebbleOS is now
available at github.com/google/pebble (see their blog post). ↫ Eric
Migicovsky Of course, this is amazing news for the still-thriving
community of Pebble users who have kept the platform and their devices
going through sheer force of will, but it also means Pebble is going to
making a comeback in a more official capacity: alongside the
announcement of PebbleOS becoming open source, there’s also the
unveiling of rePebble, a brand new Pebble watch that retains all of the
popular features and specifications of the original devices. It’ll run
the open source PebbleOS, of course, and will be compatible with the
existing ecosystem of applications. I’ve never had a Pebble, but there’s
no denying the company hit on something valuable, and I know people who
still rock their original Pebble devices to this day. The excitement
about this announcement is palpable, and I’m pleasantly surprised Google
cared enough to work on making an open source PebbleOS a reality (I know
of quite a few other companies sitting on deeply loved code and IP
rotting away in obscurity). I can’t wait to see what the new device will
look like!</p>

id="chinese-researchers-just-built-an-open-source-rival-to-chatgpt-in-2-months-and-silicon-valley-is-freaked-out">Chinese
researchers just built an open-source rival to ChatGPT in 2 months, and
Silicon Valley is freaked out</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-27, from: OS News</p>
<p>Speaking of “AI”, the Chinese company DeepSeek has lobbed a grenade
dead-centre into the middle of the “AI” bubble, and it’s been incredibly
entertaining to watch. DeepSeek has released several new “AI” models,
which seem to rival or even surpass OpenAI’s latest ChatGPT models – but
with a massive twist: DeepSeek, being Chinese, can’t use NVIDIA’s latest
GPUs, and as such, was forced to work within very tight constraints.
They’ve managed to surpass ChatGPT’s best models with a fraction of the
GPU horsepower, and thus a fraction of the cost, and a fraction of the
energy requirements. But unlike ChatGPT’s o1, DeepSeek is an
“open-weight” model that (although its training data remains
proprietary) enables users to peer inside and modify its algorithm. Just
as important is its reduced price for users — 27 times less than o1.
Besides its performance, the hype around DeepSeek comes from its cost
efficiency; the model’s shoestring budget is minuscule compared with the
tens of millions to hundreds of millions that rival companies spent to
train its competitors. ↫ Ben Turner at LiveScience The fallout has been
disastrous for NVIDIA, in particular. The company’s stock price tumbled
17% today, and more entertaining yet, the various massive investments of
hundreds of billions of dollars into western “AI” seem like a huge waste
of money. The DeepSeek models are also nominally open source, and are
clearly showing that most likely, there simply isn’t a huge “AI” market
worth hundreds of billions of dollars dollars at all. On top of that,
the US is clearly not ahead in “AI” at all, as was the common wisdom
pretty much until yesterday. Of course, DeepSeek is Chinese, and that
means censorship – the real kind – is a thing. Asking the latest
DeepSeek model about the massacre at Tiananmen Square returns nothing,
suggesting the user ask about other topics instead. I’m sure over the
coming weeks more and more or these kinds of censorship will be
discovered, but hopefully its open source nature will allow the models
to be adapted and changed to remove such censorship. Do note that all of
these “AI” models are all deeply biased because they’re trained on
content that is itself deeply biased, thereby perpetuating and
amplifying damaging stereotypes and inaccuracies, especially since
people have a tendency to assume computers can’t be biased. Whatever may
happen, at least OpenAI losing its job to “AI” is hilarious.</p>

Barely a week after DeepSeek's R1 LLM turned Silicon Valley on its head,
the Chinese outfit is back with a new release it claims is ready to
challenge OpenAI's DALL-E 3.…

interesting issues

<p>
DeepSeek's open source reasoning-capable R1 LLM family boasts impressive
benchmark scores – but its erratic responses raise more questions about
how these models were trained and what information has been censored.…

<h2 id="ai-bots-paralyze-linux-news-site-and-others">AI bots paralyze
Linux news site and others</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-27, from: OS News</p>
<p>Apparently, since the beginning of the year, AI bots have been
ensuring that websites can only respond to regular inquiries with a
delay. The founder of Linux Weekly News (LWN-net), Jonathan Corbet,
reports that the news site is therefore often slow to respond. The AI
scraper bots cause a DDoS, a distributed denial-of-service attack. At
times, the AI bots would clog the lines with hundreds of IP addresses
simultaneously as soon as they decided to access the site’s content.
Corbet explains on Mastodon that only a small proportion of the traffic
currently serves real human readers. ↫ Dirk Knop at Heise.de I’m sure
someone will tell me we just have to accept that a large percentage of
our bandwidth is going to overpriced bullshit generators, and that we
should just suck it up and pay for Sam Altman’s new house. I hope these
same people realise “AI” is destroying the last vestiges of the internet
that haven’t fallen victim to all the other techbro fads so far, and
that sooner rather than later there won’t be anything left to browse to.
The coming few years are going to be fun.</p>
