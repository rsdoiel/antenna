id="nvidia-ceo-says-company-has-plans-for-desktop-chip-designed-with-mediatek">Nvidia
CEO says company has plans for desktop chip designed with MediaTek</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>On Monday at CES 2025, Nvidia unveiled a desktop computer called
Project DIGITS. The machine uses Nvidia’s latest “Blackwell” AI chip and
will cost $3,000. It contains a new central processor, or CPU, which
Nvidia and MediaTek worked to create. Responding to an analyst’s
question during an investor presentation, Huang said Nvidia tapped
MediaTek to co-design an energy-efficient CPU that could be sold more
widely. “Now they could provide that to us, and they could keep that for
themselves and serve the market. And so it was a great win-win,” Huang
said. Previously, Reuters reported that Nvidia was working on a CPU for
personal computers to challenge the consumer and business computer
market dominance of Intel, Advanced Micro Devices and Qualcomm. ↫
Stephen Nellis at Reuters I’ve long wondered why NVIDIA wasn’t entering
the general purpose processor market in a more substantial way than it
did a few years ago with the Tegra, especially now that ARM has cemented
itself as an architecture choice for more than just mobile devices. Much
like Intel, AMD, and now Qualcomm, NVIDIA could easily deliver the whole
package to laptop, tablet, and desktop makers: processor, chipset, GPU,
of course glued together with special NVIDIA magic the other companies
opting to use NVIDIA GPUs won’t get. There’s a lot of money to be made
there, and it’s the move that could help NVIDIA survive the inevitable
crash of the “AI” wave it’s currently riding, which has pushed the
company to become one of the most valuable companies in the world. I’m
also sure OEMs would love nothing more than to have more than just
Qualcomm to choose from for ARM laptops and desktops, if only to aid in
bringing costs down through competition, and to potentially offer ARM
devices with the same kind of powerful GPUs currently mostly reserved
for x86 machines. I’m personally always for more competition, but this
time with the asterisk that NVIDIA really doesn’t need to get any bigger
than it already is. The company has a long history of screwing over
consumers, and I doubt that would change if they also conquered a chunky
slice of the general purpose processor market.</p>

<p>So we all know about twisted-pair ethernet, huh? I get a little
frustrated with a lot of histories of the topic, like the recent neil
breen<sup>w</sup>wserial port video, because they often fail to address
some obvious questions about the origin of twisted-pair network cabling.
Well, I will fail to answer these as well, because the reality is that
these answers have proven very difficult to track down. ↫ J. B. Crawford
The problems with nailing down an accurate history of the development of
the various standards, ideas, concepts, and implementations of Ethernet
and other, by now dead, network standards are their age, as well as the
fact that their history is entangled with the even longer history of
telephone wiring. The reasoning behind some of the choices made by
engineers over the past more than 100 years of telephone technology
aren’t always clear, and very difficult to retrace. Crawford dives into
some seriously old and fun history here, trying to piece together the
origins of twisted pair the best he can. It’s a great read, as all of
his writings are.</p>

<p>Hey there! In this book, we’re going to build a small operating

hear OS or kernel development, the basic functions of an OS (especially
the kernel) are surprisingly simple. Even Linux, which is often cited as
a huge open-source software, was only 8,413 lines in version 0.01.
Today’s Linux kernel is overwhelmingly large, but it started with a tiny
codebase, just like your hobby project. We’ll implement basic context
switching, paging, user mode, a command-line shell, a disk device
driver, and file read/write operations in C. Sounds like a lot, however,
it’s only 1,000 lines of code! ↫ Seiya Nuta It’s exactly what it says on

<p>NASA recently began a series of flight tests with partners to answer
an important aviation question: What will it take to integrate remotely
piloted or autonomous planes carrying large packages and cargo safely
into the U.S. airspace? Researchers tested new technologies in
Hollister, California, that are helping to investigate what tools and
capabilities are needed […]</p>

2.2 will require new “Ultra96” cables, whenever we have 8K TVs and
content</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>We’ve all had a good seven years to figure out why our interconnected
devices refused to work properly with the HDMI 2.1 specification. The
HDMI Forum announced at CES today that it’s time to start considering
new headaches. HDMI 2.2 will require new cables for full compatibility,
but it has the same physical connectors. Tiny QR codes are suggested to
help with that, however. The new specification is named HDMI 2.2, but
compatible cables will carry an “Ultra96” marker to indicate that they
can carry 96GBps, double the 48 of HDMI 2.1b. The Forum anticipates this
will result in higher resolutions and refresh rates and a “next-gen HDMI
Fixed Rate Link.” The Forum cited “AR/VR/MR, spatial reality, and light
field displays” as benefiting from increased bandwidth, along with
medical imaging and machine vision. ↫ Kevin Purdey at Ars Technica I’m
sure this will not pose any problems whatsoever, and that no shady
no-name manufacturers will abuse this situation at all. DisplayPort is
the better standard and connector anyway. No, I will not be taking
questions.</p>

<p>date: 2025-01-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>NESFab is a new programming language for creating NES games. Designed
with 8-bit limitations in mind, the language is more ergonomic to use
than C, while also producing faster assembly code. It’s easy to get
started with, and has a useful set of libraries for making your first —
or hundredth — NES game. ↫ NESFab website NESFab has some smart features
developers of NES games will certainly appreciate, most notably
automatic bank switching. Instead of doing this manually, but NESFab
will automatically carve your code and data up into banks to be switched
in and out of memory when needed. There’s also an optional map editor,
which makes it very easy to create additional levels for your game. All
in all, a very cool project I hadn’t heard of, which also claims to
perform better than other compilers. If you’ve ever considered making an
NES game, NESFab might be a tool to consider.</p>

id="dell-rebrands-its-entire-product-line-xps-inspiron-latitude-etc.-are-going-away">Dell
rebrands its entire product line: XPS, Inspiron, Latitude, etc. are
going away</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-06, from: OS News</p>
<p>Dell has announced it’s rebranding literally its entire product line,
so mainstays like XPS, Latitude, and Inspiron are going away. They’re
replacing all of these old brands with Dell, Dell Pro, and Dell Pro Max,
and within each of these, there will be three tiers: Base, Plus, and
Premium. Of course, the reason is “AI”. The AI PC market is quickly
evolving. Silicon innovation is at its strongest and everyone from IT
decision makers to professionals and everyday users are looking at
on-device AI to help drive productivity and creativity. To make finding
the right AI PC easy for customers, we’ve introduced three simple
product categories to focus on core customer needs – Dell (designed for
play, school and work), Dell Pro (designed for professional-grade
productivity) and Dell Pro Max (designed for maximum performance). 
We’ve also made it easy to distinguish products within each of the new
product categories. We have a consistent approach to tiering that lets
customers pinpoint the exact device for their specific needs. Above and
beyond the starting point (Base), there’s a Plus tier that offers the
most scalable performance and a Premium tier that delivers the ultimate
in mobility and design. ↫ Kevin Terwilliger on Dell’s blog Setting aside
the nonsensical reasoning behind the rebrand, I do actually kind of dig
the simplicity here. This is a simple, straightforward set of brand
names and tiers that pretty much anyone can understand. That being said,
the issue with Dell in particular is that once you go to their website
to actually buy one of their machines, the clarity abruptly ends and it
gets confusing fast. I hope these new brand names and tiers will
untangle some of that mess to make it easier to find what you need, but
I’m skeptical. My XPS 13 from 2017 is really starting to show its age,
and considering how happy I’ve been with it over the years its current
Dell equivalent would be a top contender (assuming I had the finances to
do so). I wonder if the Linux support on current Dell laptops has
improved since my XPS 13 was new?</p>

tone-deaf advice to Windows 10 users: just buy a new PC, you’re all
rich, right?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-06, from: OS News</p>
<p>Over 60% of Windows users are still using Windows 10, with only about
35% or so – and falling! – of them opting to use Windows 11. As we’ve
talked about many times before, this is a major issue going into 2025,
since Windows 10’s support will end in October of this year, meaning
hundreds of millions of people all over the world will suddenly be
running an operating system that will no longer receive security
updates. Most of those people don’t want to, or cannot, upgrade to
Windows 11, meaning Microsoft is leaving 60% of its Windows customer
base out to dry. I’m sure this will go down just fine with regulators
and governments the world over. Microsoft has tried everything, and it’s
clear desperation is setting in, because the company just declared 2025
“The year of the Windows 11 PC refresh”, stating that Windows 11 is the
best way to get all the “AI” stuff people are clearly clamoring for. All
of the innovation arriving on new Windows 11 PCs is coming at an
important time. We recently confirmed that after providing 10 years of
updates and support, Windows 10 will reach the end of its lifecycle on
Oct. 14, 2025. After this date, Windows 10 PCs will no longer receive
security or feature updates, and our focus is on helping customers stay
protected by moving to modern new PCs running Windows 11. Whether the
current PC needs a refresh, or it has security vulnerabilities that
require the latest hardware-backed protection, now is the time to move
forward with a new Windows 11 PC. ↫ Some overpaid executive at Microsoft
What makes this so incredibly aggravating and deeply tone-deaf is that
for most of the people affected by this, “upgrading” to Windows 11
simply isn’t a realistic option. Their current PC is most likely
performing and working just fine, but the steep and strict hardware
requirements prohibit them from installing Windows 11. Buying an
entirely new PC is often not only not needed from a performance
perspective, but for many, many people also simply unaffordable. In case
you haven’t noticed, it’s not exactly going great, financially, for a
lot of people out there, and even in the US alone, 70-80% of people live
paycheck-to-paycheck, and they’re certainly not going to be able to just
“move forward with a new Windows 11 PC” for nebulous and often
regressive “benefits” like “AI”. The fact that Microsoft seems to think
all of those hundreds of millions of people not only want to buy a new
PC to get “AI” features, but that they also can afford it like it’s no
big deal, shows some real lack of connective tissue between the halls of
Microsoft’s headquarters and the wider world. Microsoft’s utter lack of
a grasp on the financial realities of so many individuals and families
today is shocking, at best, and downright offensive, at worst. I guess
if you live in a world where you can casually bribe a president-elect
for one million dollars, buying a new computer feels like buying a bag
of potatoes.</p>

<h2 id="why-half-life-3-speculation-is-reaching-a-fever-pitch-again">Why
Half-Life 3 speculation is reaching a fever pitch again</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>The more than two decades since Half-Life 2‘s release have been
filled with plenty of rumors and hints about Half-Life 3, ranging from
the official–ish to the thin to the downright misleading. As we head
into 2025, though, we’re approaching something close to a critical mass
of rumors and leaks suggesting that Half-Life 3 is really in the works
this time, and could be officially announced in the coming months. ↫
Kyle Orland at Ars Technica We should all be skeptical of anything
related to Half-Life 3, but there’s no denying something’s buzzing. The
one reason why I personally think a Half-Life 3 might be happening is
the imminent launch of SteamOS for generic PCs, possibly accompanied by
prebuilt SteamOS PCs and consoles and third-party Steam Decks. It makes
perfect sense for Valve to have such a launch accompanied by the release
of Half-Life 3, similar to how Half-Life 2 was accompanied by the launch
of Steam. We’ll have to wait and see. It will be hard to fulfill all the
crazy expectations, though.</p>
