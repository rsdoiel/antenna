      <h1>After nine years of being broken, Windows’ dark mode is now less broken</h1>

(date: 2025-08-18, from: <a href="https://www.osnews.com/story/143126/after-nine-years-of-being-broken-windows-dark-mode-is-now-less-broken/">OS News</a>)
      <p>
      It is no secret that Windows 11&#8217;s dark mode is undercooked, to put it mildly. While modern parts of the operating system support dark mode and they look fantastic with it, plenty of commonly used UI surfaces and legacy parts are still stubbornly light. Those include common file action dialogs, such as copying/moving progress, deleting prompts, file properties dialog, and more. Nearly four years into Windows 11&#8217;s lifecycle, Microsoft is finally fixing that. ↫ Taras Buria at Neowin Many things about Windows baffle me deeply, but the half-baked, broken &#8220;dark&#8221; mode must be one of the biggest of them all. Here&#8217;s one of the largest, wealthiest companies in the world, and while introduced in 2016, the dark mode in their flagship operating system product is still effectively broken. Nine years into its existence, Windows users finally will no longer be blinded whenever they start a file operation, which is nice, I guess, but I doubt this new push to fix dark mode in Windows will cover everything. Windows&#8217; dark mode joins the Settings application as one of those things that&#8217;s just deeply half-assed in Windows. I find it incredibly hard to believe Microsoft couldn&#8217;t have taken like five developers from their &#8220;AI&#8221; team to comb through Windows years ago to address these issues, so my only conclusion is that they just don&#8217;t care. Windows and its user experience just isn&#8217;t a priority for the company, and this should really make Windows users reconsider their &#8220;choice&#8221; of operating system.

      <h1>Google is killing the open web</h1>

(date: 2025-08-18, from: <a href="https://www.osnews.com/story/143123/google-is-killing-the-open-web/">OS News</a>)
      <p>
      Google is managing to achieve what Microsoft couldn&#8217;t: killing the open web. The efforts of tech giants to gain control of and enclose the commons for extractive purposes have been clear to anyone who has been following the history of the Internet for at least the last decade, and the adopted strategies are varied in technique as they are in success, from Embrace, Extend, Extinguish (EEE) to monopolization and lock-in. What I want to talk about in this article is the war Google has been waging on XML for over a decade, why it matters that they&#8217;ve finally encroached themselves enough to get what they want, and what we can do to fight this. ↫ Oblomov (I can&#8217;t discern the author&#8217;s preferred name) Google&#8217;s quest to destroy the open web &#8211; or at the very least, aggressively contain it &#8211; is not new, and we&#8217;re all aware of it. Since Google makes most of its money from online advertising, what the company really wants is a sanitised, corporate web that is deeply centralised around as few big players as possible. The smaller the number of players that have an actual influence on web, the better &#8211; it&#8217;s much easier for Google to find common ground with other megacorps like Apple or Microsoft than with smaller players, open source projects, and individuals who actually care about the openness of the web. One of Google&#8217;s primary points of attack is XML and everything related to it, like RSS, XMLT, and so on. If you use RSS, you&#8217;re not loading web pages and thus not seeing Google&#8217;s ads. If you use XSLT to transform an RSS feed into a browsable website, you&#8217;re again not seeing any ads. Effectively, anything that we can use to avoid online advertising is a direct threat to Google&#8217;s bottom line, and thus you can be certain Google will try to remove, break, or otherwise cripple it in some way. The most recent example is yet another attempt by Google to kill XSLT. XSLT, or Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations, is a language which allows you to transform any XML document &#8211; like an RSS feed &#8211; into other formats, like HTML, plaintext, and tons more. Google has been trying to kill XSLT for over a decade, but it&#8217;s such an unpopular move that they had to back down the first time they proposed its removal. They&#8217;re proposing it again, and the feedback has been just as negative. And we finally get to these days. Just as RSS feeds are making a comeback and users are starting to grow skeptic of the corporate silos, Google makes another run to kill XSLT, this time using the WHATWG as a sock puppet. Particularly of note, the corresponding Chromium issue was created before the WHATWG Github issue. It is thus to no one&#8217;s surprise that the overwhelmingly negative reactions to the issue, the detailed explanations about why XSLT is important, how instead of removing it browsers should move to more recent versions of the standard, and even the indications of existing better and more secure libraries to base such new implementations on, every counterpoint to the removal have gone completely ignored.  In the end, the WHATWG was forced to close down comments to the Github issue to stop the flood of negative feedback, so that the Googler could move on to the next step: commencing the process of formalizing the dismissal of XSLT. ↫ Oblomov (I can&#8217;t discern the author&#8217;s preferred name) At this point in time, there&#8217;s really no more web standards as we idealise them in our head. It&#8217;s effectively just Google, and perhaps Apple, deciding what is a web &#8220;standard&#8221; and what isn&#8217;t, their decisions guided not by what&#8217;s best for a healthy and thriving open web, but by what&#8217;s best for their respective bottom lines. The reason the web looks and feels like ass now is not because we wanted it to be so, but because Google and the other technology giants made it so. Everyone is just playing by their rules because otherwise, you won&#8217;t show up in Google Search or your site won&#8217;t work properly in mobile Safari. This very detailed article and the recent renewed interest in XSLT &#8211; thanks for letting everyone know, Google! &#8211; has me wondering if OSNews should use XSLT to create a pretty version of our RSS feed that will render nicely even in browsers without any RSS support. It doesn&#8217;t seem too difficult, so I&#8217;ll see if I can find someone to figure this out (I lack the skills, obviously). We&#8217;ve already removed our ads, and I think our RSS feed is full-article already anyway, so why not have a minimal version of OSNews you could browse to in your browser that&#8217;s based on our RSS feed and XSLT?

      If you&#8217;re interested in developing for and programming on MS-DOS and other variants of the venerable operating system, SuperIlu has collected the various tools and applications they use and like for this very task. In case you&#8217;re wondering who SuperIlu is &#8211; they are the developer of things like DOStodon, a Mastodon client for DOS, DOjS, and much more. This is my short list of interesting resources for MS-DOS development. This is neither meant to be unbiased nor exhaustive, it is just a list of software/tools I know and/or use. The focus is on free and open source software. ↫ SuperIlu at GitHub None of the items on the list are abandonware, so there&#8217;s no risk of relying on things that are no longer being developed. With most of the items also being free and open source software, you can further be assured you&#8217;re safe from the odd rugpull. If you&#8217;re into DOS development, this is a treasure trove.

      <h1>Understanding GNOME Shell’s focus stealing prevention</h1>

(date: 2025-08-18, from: <a href="https://www.osnews.com/story/143117/understanding-gnome-shells-focus-stealing-prevention/">OS News</a>)
      <p>
      A week ago we talked about focus stealing prevention on KDE and Wayland, and this time we have a similar article, but detailing GNOME&#8217;s approach instead. Many of the underlying mechanisms are the same, of course, but since GNOME uses a different window manager, the details are different. The problem GNOME faces is the same as KDE, though: application and toolkit developers need to adopt the XDG Activation protocol, but the question is how to get there. While some people have asked for focus stealing prevention to be disabled completely until it’s implemented by most apps and toolkits, I’m not sure this is the best way forward. If we did that, nobody would notice which apps don’t implement it, so there’d be no reason for toolkits to do so. On the other hand, there are some remaining issues around terminal applications and similar use cases that we don’t have a plan for yet, so just switching to&#160;strict&#160;to flush out app bugs isn’t ideal either at the moment. ↫ Julian Sparber Basically, the GNOME team doesn&#8217;t yet know how to move forward, and is collecting feedback and gathering information to see where to go from here. My suggestion would be to coordinate this effort with the KDE team, as the underlying systems and protocols are identical and the end goal is the same: get applications and toolkits to properly support XDG Activation. Many popular applications are shared between the two desktop environments anyway, so it makes sense to apply some mild pressure together, as one. Once support has permeated enough of the ecosystem to allow for focus stealing prevention to become stricter, GNOME and KDE would still be free to go off into their own directions.

      We removed ads from OSNews. Donate to our fundraiser to ensure our future! One of the most hated &#8220;features&#8221; of Windows is its update system &#8211; it&#8217;s slow, error-prone, and most annoyingly of all, tends to interrupt users at the worst possible times. This last issue is apparently so common it&#8217;s basically a recognisable meme, among both tech enthusiasts as well as regular users. The root cause of the problem is that because Microsoft wants to force users to install updates, you can only postpone them for a short while, after which Windows will install updates, even if you&#8217;re about to start a presentation. Microsoft is now bringing this approach to the Microsoft Store. Up until now, the Microsoft Store allowed you to install updates whenever you pleased, but that&#8217;s no longer the case. Just like Windows Update, you now only have the option to postpone application updates for a short while, after which they will be installed. There&#8217;s no registry hack to turn this off or revert back to the old behaviour. Be advised in case you&#8217;re using applications from the Microsoft Store for anything critical that starting soon, they will just update in the middle of whatever you&#8217;re doing. Splendid.

      We removed ads from OSNews. Donate to our fundraiser to ensure our future! We all know the earlier versions of Windows NT were available not only for x86, but also for MIPS, Alpha, and PowerPC (and there were unreleased ports to SPARC and Clipper). While we have the operating systems archived and available, applications properly compiled for the non-x86 versions of Windows NT can be a bit harder to come by. For instance, while Microsoft Word for MIPS and Alpha have been available for a while, we apparently never had a copy of Microsoft Word for PowerPC archived. Until now. Antoni Sawicki was pointed to an eBay auction for a copy of Microsoft Office Standard 4.2, and the photographed box clearly said it contained version for x86, Alpha, MIPS, and PowerPC. He decided to buy it, and it did, indeed, contain the PowerPC version of Microsoft Word. Of course, he made this version of Office available online for posterity. An excellent find, and good to see we have people willing to spend money just to ensure software isn&#8217;t lost to time.

Well, here we have a detailed guide to setting up a FreeBSD desktop using KDE Plasma and Wayland. Yes, Wayland is available in the BSD world as well, and in a few years I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised to see most FreeBSD desktop guides &#8211; including the documentation from FreeBSD itself &#8211; to primarily advise using Wayland over X11, as Wayland support in FreeBSD improve even further. I&#8217;m sure this will upset nobody.

      We removed ads from OSNews. Donate to our fundraiser to ensure our future! It&#8217;s weekend, you might be visiting friends or relatives, and perhaps some of them are curious about switching away from Windows or macOS to Linux. There&#8217;s countless guides out there about this very topic, but to help you along a bit and cut through the avalanche of &#8220;AI&#8221; and SEO slop, here&#8217;s a true beginners&#8217; guide to desktop Linux written by KDE developer Akseli Lahtinen, second most famous developer out of Finland after Linus Torvalds. There has been quite a surge in interest towards desktop Linux lately. The userbase, atleast according to&#160;some metrics, seems to be climbing. I realised today that it&#8217;s been 4 years for me since I did the switch. I have gathered some know-how that maybe a complete newbie could find useful. I also try to untangle some jargon I&#8217;ve learned: It may not be exactly technically correct, but this is meant for a more regular user anyway. ↫ Akseli Lahtinen This won&#8217;t be particularly interesting for most people who read a site like OSNews, but it&#8217;s a great roundup for newcomers in your circle.

      We removed ads from OSNews. Donate to our fundraiser to ensure our future! Ever wanted to know everything about a specific 8×19 font Intel used for the POST and BIOS screens on its motherboards? OS/2 Museum&#8217;s Michal Necasek has you covered. The obvious remaining question is, who came up with 8×19 fonts for BIOS use? Was it really Intel? Or was it someone else? Note that the Intel boards were used by many OEMs (including but not limited to AST, Dell, Gateway, HP, Micron, Packard Bell) so just because an OEM system uses an 8×19 font doesn’t mean there isn’t Intel behind it. ↫ Michal Necasek Great weekend reading, as always, from Necasek.

Quite a few people have made the case to run macOS especially on the latter, and it seems this isn&#8217;t as much of an unobtainable pipe dream as you might think. Duy Tran has been working on getting macOS to run on jailbroken iPhones and iPads, and it seems he&#8217;s making some headway. Eventually, I managed to boot somewhat macOS 13.4 natively on my iPhone XS Max on iOS 16.5; keyboard &#38; mouse input is currently done via VNC. After some manual patching, many apps and daemons running (WindowServer, ControlCenter, Dock, and even Xcode 15b8). ↫ Duy Tran on Reddit It should go without saying this is incredibly limited so far, and there&#8217;s immense amounts of work required to bring this to a point where anyone could use this in any serious manner. Still, it&#8217;s very impressive so far, and it shows beyond the shadow of a doubt that macOS can, indeed, run on iPads if Apple wanted it to. This initial code is on GitHub, but it&#8217;s definitely not for the faint of heart.

An internal Meta Platforms document detailing policies on chatbot behavior has permitted&#160;the company’s artificial intelligence&#160;creations to “engage a child in conversations that are romantic or sensual,” generate false medical information and help users argue that Black people are “dumber than white people.” These and other findings emerge from a Reuters review of the Meta document, which discusses the standards that guide its generative AI assistant,&#160;Meta AI, and chatbots available on Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, the company’s social-media platforms. ↫ Jeff Horwitz at Reuters The only way one can describe the examples of allowed behaviour towards minors is absolutely fucked up. If I&#8217;d find any person talking to my kids like Facebook and Zuckerberg apparently think it&#8217;s okay to talk to children, I&#8217;d be calling the police to file a report. I know I shouldn&#8217;t be surprised considering it&#8217;s Facebook and Zuckerberg, a company with a history of knowingly inciting violence and genocide and a founder who created his website to creep on women, but the lows to which this company and its founder are willing to go are just so unimaginable to even people with just a modicum of morality, I just can&#8217;t wrap my brain around it. The treatment of people of colour isn&#8217;t any better. Facebook will happily argue for you that black people are dumber than white people without so much as batting an eye. Again, none of this should be surprising considering it&#8217;s Facebook, but add to it the fact that &#8220;AI&#8221; is the endgame for totalitarians, and it all makes even more sense. These tools are explicitly designed to generate totalitarian propaganda, because they&#8217;re trained on totalitarian propaganda, i.e., most of the internet. The examples of &#8220;AI&#8221; being fascist and racist are legion, and considering the people creating them &#8211; Zuckerberg, Altman, Musk, and so on &#8211; all have clear fascist and totalitarian tendencies or simply are overtly fascist, we, again, shouldn&#8217;t be surprised. Totalitarians hate artists and intellectuals, because artists and intellectuals are the ones who tend to not fall for their bullshit. That&#8217;s why one of the first steps taken by any totalitarian regime is curtailing the arts and sciences, from Pol Pot to Mao, from Trump to Orban. Promoting &#8220;AI&#8221; as a replacement for exactly these groups in society &#8211; &#8220;AI&#8221; generating &#8220;art&#8221; to replace artists, &#8220;AI&#8221; doing &#8220;research&#8221; to replace actual scientists &#8211; fits within the totalitarian playbook like a perfectly fitted glove. When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time. This apparently also applies to &#8220;AI&#8221;.

      <h1>Open hardware desktop 3D printing is dead – you just don’t know it yet</h1>

(date: 2025-08-15, from: <a href="https://www.osnews.com/story/143081/open-hardware-desktop-3d-printing-is-dead-you-just-dont-know-it-yet/">OS News</a>)
      <p>
      We removed ads from OSNews. Donate to our fundraiser to ensure our future! Hi, FAB 2025 is still happening in Prague and it has been a wonderful event. It’s been great to meet so many people from our community at home, in Czechia! But during my chats with the attendee’s, there was one topic which was emerging time and time again, and that is the state of open hardware. I cannot talk about all of the open hardware, but I can share experience from 3D printing. And it is not good! Open hardware in 3D printing is dead &#8211; you just don’t know it yet. This is an opinion piece, imagine we are talking about this topic over a cold Pilsner&#8230; ↫ Josef Prusa What happens when the Chinese government lists 3D printing as an industry it wants to dominate? Well, an explosion in bogus patents and the death of tons of smaller, local brands, leaving only major players from China and perhaps one or two bigger non-Chinese brands. That&#8217;s the conclusion by Josef Prusa, founder of Prusa Research, a major 3D printer maker from Prague, Czechia. Prusa&#8217;s printers used to be entirely open source, but starting in 2023, this is no longer the case &#8211; ostensibly because being open source hardware meant that competitors were copying their work wholesale without contributing anything back, or worse, stealing their work entirely and keeping it all closed, despite the copyleft license in use. Looking at the numbers, it seems clear that smaller companies will not be able to deal with the onslaught of bogus patents, as fighting patent infringement claims in court and getting patents invalidated, even if prior art exists in abundance, is prohibitively expensive and incredibly time-consuming. It&#8217;s a game of really expensive whack-a-mole against people with far deeper pockets than you. Still, this whole thing does taste a bit sour considering Prusa&#8217;s abandonment of its open source roots and ideals. There&#8217;s a business to be run here, I understand that, but principles do matter, and if not even a company priding itself on producing open source hardware stands by its ideals, why should anyone else?

      We removed ads from OSNews. Donate to our fundraiser to ensure our future! We all managed to survive another month, so here we are, with another monthly update from Haiku, covering the month of July. It&#8217;s been a rather short month, it being the middle of Summer and all, but there&#8217;s still some significant stuff in here. For instance, a whole slew of fixes arrived for su and other multiuser commands, mostly for the benefit of SSH sessions. A central theme in July seems to have been filesystems, as FAT16 was added to the known filesystem types in the Storage Kit, quite a few fixes were implemented for NFSv4, and a number of filesystems saw bugfixes to fix issues in rsync, and much more. Another central theme is apparently a port of DOSEMU, for which a number of bugfixes, changes, and improvements were implemented that could, in turn, also benefit other possible ports. And of course, there&#8217;s much, much more that happened, for which you&#8217;ll have to dive into the full progress report.

We&#8217;re not done with the AROS news quite yet, as Andrzej Subocz published another update with the latest news from the AROS community. Some of it we already covered, but a lot it we haven&#8217;t. For instance, there&#8217;s the initial version of a partitioning tool for AROS, called QuickPart. For now, it&#8217;s in read-only mode, but once it&#8217;s complete, it will allow users to do, well, partitioning. Work has also begun on porting SDL2 to AROS, replacing the aging SDL 1.2 version currently available. On top of all that, there&#8217;s a lot of work on new and improved network drivers for the 64bit version, an extensive amount of changes and improvements to the build system, C library, datatypes, and much more. Subocz&#8217; full report has many more details, so head on over and read up.

      <h1>AmiBrowser: the Chromium engine running on a Linux host talking to a 68K Amiga application running inside a 68K emulator</h1>

      <p>
      We removed ads from OSNews. Donate to our fundraiser to ensure our future! Covering the Amiga world is always a bit of a crapshoot, since for what is surely an incredibly small segment of the computing world, it happens to be incredibly complex, with multiple competing Amiga-ish operating systems and hardware platforms, all worsened by many empty promises and bitter animosity flying every which way. This makes it hard for an outsider to get a firm grasp on what&#8217;s going on, but as always, I&#8217;ll try my best. The news here is that AmiKit has released a new browser for the classic 68k Amiga that can load modern websites. The browser is called AmiBrowser. AmiBrowser is an HTML 5 capable web browser built for 68K with Zune/MUI. Ituses ARM libraries to power the native rendering of the web pages. ↫ AmiKit press release AmiBrowser is exclusive to AmiKit&#8217;s own Amiga-like hardware, the A600 GS and A1200 NG, both of which are replacement boards for the original Amiga 600 and 1200, respectively. How do these machines work? Well, they come in the shape of their original counterparts, but with far fewer chips, and one crucial addition: a little Orange Pi Zero 3 (in the case of the A1200 NG, at least) daughterboard that contains the actual ARM SoC that powers the machine. The way this setup works is that the Orange Pi Zero 3 boots into a minimal Linux environment with a launcher-like interface, which can in turn load up the Amiberry classic 68K Amiga emulator that can communicate with its ARM Linux host. It&#8217;s inside this 68K emulator where the actual operating system runs. This Amiga-like operating system is called AmiBench, which is, very simply put, a modified variant of the 68K version of AROS, combined with libraries and components that can make use of the ARM processor. And so we finally arrive at this new browser. This new browser runs the Chromium Embedded Framework in the host Linux environment on the ARM processor, forwarding its rendering towards a native 68K Amiga/AROS application that&#8217;s running inside the 68K emulator. In between the CEF running on the Linux host and the native Amiga 68K application running inside the emulator sits a glue layer that takes care of the communication between the two sides. It&#8217;s an interesting approach to a very difficult problem: how do you run a modern browser on a hardware platform &#8211; 68K, in this case &#8211; that is horribly outdated and far too slow to deal with modern websites? It&#8217;s an interesting approach, but it also feels a little bit like a house of cards. That being said, if the choice is between no access to the modern web and shaky access to the modern web, I&#8217;d still choose the latter.
