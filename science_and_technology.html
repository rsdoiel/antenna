<h2 id="reviving-a-dead-audio-format-the-return-of-zzm">Reviving a dead
audio format: the return of ZZM</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>Long-time readers will know that my first video game love was the
text-mode video game slash creation studio ZZT. One feature of this game
is the ability to play simple music through the PC speaker, and back in
the day, I remember that the format “ZZM” existed, so you could enjoy
the square wave tunes outside of the games. But imagine my surprise in
2025 to find that, while the Museum of ZZT does have a ZZM Audio
section, it recommends that nobody use the format anymore; because
nobody’s made a player that doesn’t require MS-DOS. Let’s fix that by
making a player with way higher system requirements, using everyone’s
favorite coding environment: Javascript. ↫ Nicole Branagan ZZM’s history
and Branagan’s journey to make this work without having to rely on DOS
took a lot more work than I expected, and is quite interesting, too.
Very niche, for sure, but that’s kind of what we’re here for.</p>

invalid 68030 instruction that accidentally allowed the Mac Classic II
to successfully boot up</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>A bug in the ROM for the Macintosh II was recently discovered that
causes a crash when booting in 32-bit mode. Doug Brown discovered and
documented the bug while playing with the MAME debugger. Why did it
never show up before? It seems a quirk in Motorola’s 68030 CPU
inadvertently fixes it when executing an illegal instruction that
shouldn’t have been executed in the first place. What follows is his
process for investigating the room on emulated hardware, and then
testing it on actual hardware.</p>

id="pebbleos-becomes-open-source-new-pebble-device-announced">PebbleOS
becomes open source, new Pebble device announced</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-27, from: OS News</p>
<p>Eric Migicovsky, founder of Pebble, the original smartwatch maker,
made a major announcement today together with Google. Pebble was
originally bought by Fitbit and in turn Fitbit was then bought by
Google, but Migicovsky always wanted to to go back to his original idea
and create a brand new smartwatch. PebbleOS took dozens of engineers
working over 4 years to build, alongside our fantastic product and QA
teams. Reproducing that for new hardware would take a long time.
Instead, we took a more direct route – I asked friends at Google (which
bought Fitbit, which had bought Pebble’s IP) if they could open source
PebbleOS. They said yes! Over the last year, a team inside Google
(including some amazing ex-Pebblers turned Googlers) has been working on
this. And today is the day – the source code for PebbleOS is now
available at github.com/google/pebble (see their blog post). ↫ Eric
Migicovsky Of course, this is amazing news for the still-thriving
community of Pebble users who have kept the platform and their devices
going through sheer force of will, but it also means Pebble is going to
making a comeback in a more official capacity: alongside the
announcement of PebbleOS becoming open source, there’s also the
unveiling of rePebble, a brand new Pebble watch that retains all of the
popular features and specifications of the original devices. It’ll run
the open source PebbleOS, of course, and will be compatible with the
existing ecosystem of applications. I’ve never had a Pebble, but there’s
no denying the company hit on something valuable, and I know people who
still rock their original Pebble devices to this day. The excitement
about this announcement is palpable, and I’m pleasantly surprised Google
cared enough to work on making an open source PebbleOS a reality (I know
of quite a few other companies sitting on deeply loved code and IP
rotting away in obscurity). I can’t wait to see what the new device will
look like!</p>

id="chinese-researchers-just-built-an-open-source-rival-to-chatgpt-in-2-months-and-silicon-valley-is-freaked-out">Chinese
researchers just built an open-source rival to ChatGPT in 2 months, and
Silicon Valley is freaked out</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-27, from: OS News</p>
<p>Speaking of “AI”, the Chinese company DeepSeek has lobbed a grenade
dead-centre into the middle of the “AI” bubble, and it’s been incredibly
entertaining to watch. DeepSeek has released several new “AI” models,
which seem to rival or even surpass OpenAI’s latest ChatGPT models – but
with a massive twist: DeepSeek, being Chinese, can’t use NVIDIA’s latest
GPUs, and as such, was forced to work within very tight constraints.
They’ve managed to surpass ChatGPT’s best models with a fraction of the
GPU horsepower, and thus a fraction of the cost, and a fraction of the
energy requirements. But unlike ChatGPT’s o1, DeepSeek is an
“open-weight” model that (although its training data remains
proprietary) enables users to peer inside and modify its algorithm. Just
as important is its reduced price for users — 27 times less than o1.
Besides its performance, the hype around DeepSeek comes from its cost
efficiency; the model’s shoestring budget is minuscule compared with the
tens of millions to hundreds of millions that rival companies spent to
train its competitors. ↫ Ben Turner at LiveScience The fallout has been
disastrous for NVIDIA, in particular. The company’s stock price tumbled
17% today, and more entertaining yet, the various massive investments of
hundreds of billions of dollars into western “AI” seem like a huge waste
of money. The DeepSeek models are also nominally open source, and are
clearly showing that most likely, there simply isn’t a huge “AI” market
worth hundreds of billions of dollars dollars at all. On top of that,
the US is clearly not ahead in “AI” at all, as was the common wisdom
pretty much until yesterday. Of course, DeepSeek is Chinese, and that
means censorship – the real kind – is a thing. Asking the latest
DeepSeek model about the massacre at Tiananmen Square returns nothing,
suggesting the user ask about other topics instead. I’m sure over the
coming weeks more and more or these kinds of censorship will be
discovered, but hopefully its open source nature will allow the models
to be adapted and changed to remove such censorship. Do note that all of
these “AI” models are all deeply biased because they’re trained on
content that is itself deeply biased, thereby perpetuating and
amplifying damaging stereotypes and inaccuracies, especially since
people have a tendency to assume computers can’t be biased. Whatever may
happen, at least OpenAI losing its job to “AI” is hilarious.</p>

Linux news site and others</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-27, from: OS News</p>
<p>Apparently, since the beginning of the year, AI bots have been
ensuring that websites can only respond to regular inquiries with a
delay. The founder of Linux Weekly News (LWN-net), Jonathan Corbet,
reports that the news site is therefore often slow to respond. The AI
scraper bots cause a DDoS, a distributed denial-of-service attack. At
times, the AI bots would clog the lines with hundreds of IP addresses
simultaneously as soon as they decided to access the site’s content.
Corbet explains on Mastodon that only a small proportion of the traffic
currently serves real human readers. ↫ Dirk Knop at Heise.de I’m sure
someone will tell me we just have to accept that a large percentage of
our bandwidth is going to overpriced bullshit generators, and that we
should just suck it up and pay for Sam Altman’s new house. I hope these
same people realise “AI” is destroying the last vestiges of the internet
that haven’t fallen victim to all the other techbro fads so far, and
that sooner rather than later there won’t be anything left to browse to.
The coming few years are going to be fun.</p>
