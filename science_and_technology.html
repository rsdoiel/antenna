released</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-01, from: OS News</p>
<p>The prime feature is the continuation of the multi-monitor topic of
the previous release, covering multi-monitor window management and going
as far as seamlessly integrating multi-monitor virtual machines (Section
Multi-monitor window management and virtual machines). The second and
long anticipated feature is the Chromium engine version 112 in
combination with Qt 6.6.2, which brings our port of the Falkon web
browser on par with the modern web (Section Qt, WebEngine, and Falkon
browser). On the account of exploratory activities, we are happy to
report that Qemu can now be used directly on Genode (Section Qemu on
Genode). ↫ Genode release notes Another incredibly impressive set of
improvements to Genode, which will benefit Sculpt OS, too of course.
Aside from the improvements mentioned above, there’s also new support
for Intel’s Meteor Lake and embedded F&amp;S MX8MP armStone boards,
improvements to USB and audio, and much more.</p>

<h2 id="netboot-windows-11-with-iscsi-and-ipxe">Netboot Windows 11 with
iSCSI and iPXE</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-01, from: OS News</p>
<p>For the past several years my desktop has also had a disk dedicated
to maintaining a Windows install. I’d prefer to use the space in my PC
case for disks for Linux. Since I already run a home NAS, and my Windows
usage is infrequent, I wondered if I could offload the Windows install
to my NAS instead. This lead me down the course of netbooting Windows 11
and writing up these notes on how to do a simplified “modern” version. ↫
Terin Stock The setup Terin Stock ended up with is rather ingenious, to
be honest. They had to create not just an environment in which
netbooting through iXPE using iSCSI, but also a customised Windows PE
ISO that included the necessary drivers to make installing Windows onto
a iSCSI-connected remote drive possible in the first place, because
they’re not included in the Windows installation ISO. This isn’t exactly
a standard setup, of course, so there were a few roadblocks to clear
before getting there. They now have Windows 11 booting from a drive in
their NAS, and it seems it doesn’t affect gaming – the reason why they
did this in the first place is an online game that hard-requires Windows
– at all. Installing the game through Steam took a bit longer, sure, but
regular gameplay seems unaffected, and there’s no saturation on the
network or disk. You’d think this would be wholly too slow to be
suitable for gaming, but I guess at least some games handle this just
fine. My uneducated guess is that more demanding games that rely on a
ton of disk activity to load textures and so on will have a much more
difficult time running. In any event, this intrigues me, and I’m kind of
curious to try and set this up myself, if only for the memes. It looks
like fun.</p>

<h2 id="mozilla-deletes-promise-not-to-sell-firefox-users-data">Mozilla
deletes promise not to sell Firefox users’ data</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>The hits just keep on coming. Mozilla not only changed its Privacy
Notice and introduced a Terms of Use for Firefox for the first time with
some pretty onerous terms, they also removed a rather specific question
and answer pair from their page with frequently asked questions about
Firefox, as discovered by David Gerard. The following question and
answer were removed: Does Firefox sell your personal data? Nope. Never
have, never will. And we protect you from many of the advertisers who
do. Firefox products are designed to protect your privacy. That’s a
promise. ↫ David Gerard detailing what has been removed This promise is
now gone from the website, a removal which tells you all you need to
know about what Mozilla has in mind. Combine it with the much broadened
data collection and buying and claiming to be an online advertising
company, and what I have been predicting and warning everyone about has
come to pass: Firefox has become a mere tool to collect user data, user
data to be sold by Mozilla for the purposes of advertising. For years
I’ve been warning about this inevitable outcome, and for just as many
years people told me I was overreacting, that it wouldn’t happen, that I
was crazy. The problem is especially dire for the desktop Linux world,
who soon might not have a browser they can safely include in their ISOs
and base installations. A desktop Linux installation with Chromium where
you have to manually drag and drop extensions to install them, and set
up a Google API key just to get browser sync, isn’t exactly a great
experience. At this point I have no idea where to go. Chrome and its
various skins are a no-go, obviously, and relatively soft forks like
LibreWolf are still dependent on Firefox and Mozilla. Alternatives like
Falkon also use the Chromium engine deep down, and have their own set of
issues and lack of manpower to deal with. Apple users are somewhat lucky
to have the WebKit-based Safari to work with, but I’d rather publish my
personal data in The New York Times than trust Apple and Tim Cook. We’re
right back where we started. Lovely.</p>

if we didn’t use TCP or UDP?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-27, from: OS News</p>
<p>At some point, I wondered—what if I sent a packet using a transport
protocol that didn’t exist? Not TCP, not UDP, not even ICMP—something
completely made up. Would the OS let it through? Would it get stopped
before it even left my machine? Would routers ignore it, or would some
middlebox kill it on sight? Could it actually move faster by slipping
past common firewall rules? No idea. So I had to try. ↫ Hawzen Okay so
the end result is that it’s technically possible to send a packet across
the internet that isn’t TCP/UDP/ICMP, but you have to take that
literally: one packet.</p>

<h2 id="a-love-letter-to-void-linux">A love letter to Void Linux</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-27, from: OS News</p>
<p>I installed Void on my current laptop on the 10th of December 2021,
and there has never been any reinstall. The distro is absurdly stable.
It’s a rolling release, and yet, the worst update I had in those years
was one time, GTK 4 apps took a little longer to open on GNOME. Which
was reverted after a few hours. Not only that, I sometimes spent months
without any update, and yet, whenever I did update, absolutely nothing
went wrong. Granted, I pretty much only did full upgrades, and never
partial upgrades, which generally help a lot. Still. ↫ Sarah Mathey Void
is love, Void is life. It’s such an absurdly good distribution, and if
it wasn’t for the fact that I prefer Fedora KDE by a hair, I’d be using
Void on all of my machines. The only reason I’m not is that I would set
up Void very close to what I get from Fedora KDE out of the box anyway,
so my laziness gets the better of me there. I used to run Void on my
POWER9 hardware, but that architecture is no longer supported by Void.
If you’re looking for a Linux distribution free of systemd, there’s
little out there that can equal or top Void, and even if you don’t care
much about init systems, Void still has a lot to offer. The
documentation is decent, its package manager is a joy to use, the
repositories are loaded and up-to-date, and it strikes a great balance
between building an entire Linux system from scratch on the one hand,
and complete desktop distributions like Fedora on the other. The best
way I can describe it is that Void feels like the most BSD-y of Linux
distributions. Void is my fallback, in case Fedora for whatever reason
slips up and dies. IBM, Red Hat, “AI” – there’s a lot of pits Fedora can
fall into, after all.</p>

surrogate pairs: why some Windows filenames can’t be read</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-26, from: OS News</p>
<p>Windows was an early adopter of Unicode, and its file APIs use UTF‑16
internally since Windows 2000-used to be UCS-2 in Windows 95 era, when
Unicode standard was only a draft on paper, but that’s another topic.
Using UTF-16 means that filenames, text strings, and other data are
stored as sequences of 16‑bit units. For Windows, a properly formed
surrogate pair is perfectly acceptable. However, issues arise when
string manipulation produces isolated or malformed surrogates. Such
errors can lead to unreadable filenames and display glitches—even though
the operating system itself can execute files correctly. But we can
create them deliberately as well, which we can see below. ↫ Zafer Balkan

id="mozilla-is-going-to-collect-a-lot-more-data-from-firefox-users">Mozilla
is going to collect a lot more data from Firefox users</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-26, from: OS News</p>
<p>I guess my praise for Mozilla’s and Firefox’ continued support for
Manifest v2 had to be balanced out by Mozilla doing something stupid.
Mozilla just published Terms of Use for Firefox for the first time, as
well as an updated Privacy Notice, that come into effect immediately and
include some questionable terms. The Terms of Use state: When you upload
or input information through Firefox, you hereby grant us a
nonexclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license to use that information to
help you navigate, experience, and interact with online content as you
indicate with your use of Firefox. ↫ Firefox’ new Terms of Use That’s
incredibly broad, and it could easily be argued that this gives Mozilla
the right to use whatever you post or upload online through Firefox,
which is clearly insane. However, it might also just be standard,
regular, wholly unenforceable legalese, but the fact it’s in the Firefox
Terms of Use now that you have to accept is disconcerting. Does this
mean that if an artist uses Firefox to upload a new song they made,
Mozilla now has a license to use that song in whatever way they deem
fit? You’d hope not, but that does seem what the terms are stating here.
Moving on to the new Privacy Notice, and it seems Mozilla intends to
collect more data in more situations. For instance, Mozilla is going to
collect things such as “Unique identifiers” and “Browsing data” to
“Market services”, consent for which Mozilla will only ask for in
jurisdictions where such consent is required, and it’s opt-out, not
opt-in. I would hazard a guess that even in places where strict privacy
regulations are in place, the wording of such consent will probably be
obtuse, and the opt-out checkbox hidden somewhere deep in settings.
Mozilla also intends to collect “all data types” to “comply with
applicable laws, and identify and prevent harmful, unauthorized or
illegal activity”. Considering how fast, I don’t know, being trans or
women’s health care is criminalised in the US, “illegal activity” can
cover a lot of damn things once you have totalitarians like Musk and
Trump in power. An organisation like Mozilla shouldn’t be collecting any
data types, let alone all of them, and especially not in places where
such data types can lead to real harm to innocent people. The backlash
to the new Terms of Use and updated Privacy Notice is already growing,
and it further cements my worries that Mozilla is intending to invest
more and more into becoming an advertising company first, browser maker
second. The kinds of data they’re going to collect now from Firefox
users are exactly the kinds of data that are incredibly useful to
advertisers, and it doesn’t take a genius to see where this is
going.</p>

Windows NT made to run on GameCube and Wii</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-26, from: OS News</p>
<p>Remember about half a year ago, when the PowerPC versions of Windows
NT were made to run on certain models of PowerPC Macs? The same
developer responsible for that work, Rairii, took all of this to the
next level, and it’s now possible to run the PowerPC version of Windows
NT on the GameCube, Wii, Wii U, and a few related development boards. NT
3.51 RTM and higher. NT 3.51 betas (build 944 and below) will need
kernel patches to run due to processor detection bugs. NT 3.5 will never
be compatible, as it only supports PowerPC 601. (The additional
suspend/hibernation features in NT 3.51 PMZ could be made compatible in
theory but in practise would require all of the additional drivers for
that to be reimplemented.) ↫ Windows NT for GameCube/Wii GitHub page As
you may have expected, there are some issues, such as instability and
random reboots, USB hotplugging doesn’t work, and some other, smaller
issues, but none of that takes away from just how awesome and impressive
this really is. There’s framebuffer support for the Flipper GPU, full
support for the controllers ports and a ton of compatible controllers
and related input devices, including support for the N64 mouse and
keyboard, although said support is untested. The GameCube and Wii (U)
are PowerPC computers, after all, running IBM processors, so it
shouldn’t be surprising that running Windows NT on them is possible.
Still, it’s an impressive feat of engineering to get this to work at
all, let alone in as complete a state as it appears to be.</p>

<h2 id="zlib-rs-is-faster-than-c">zlib-rs is faster than C</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-26, from: OS News</p>
<p>I’m sure we can all have a calm, rational discussion about this, so
here it goes: zlib-rs, the Rust re-implementation of the zlib library,
is now faster than its C counterparts in both decompression and
compression. We’ve released version 0.4.2 of zlib-rs, featuring a number
of substantial performance improvements. We are now (to our knowledge)
the fastest api-compatible zlib implementation for decompression, and
beat the competition in the most important compression cases too. ↫
Folkert de Vries As someone who isn’t a programmer, looking at all the
controversies and fallout around anything related to Rust is both
fascinating and worrying. Fascinating because Rust clearly brings a
whole slew of improvements over established and older languages, and
worrying because the backlash from the establishment has been wildly
irrational and bordering on the childish, complete with tamper tantrums
and the taking of balls and going home. It shouldn’t surprise me that
people get attached to programming languages the same way people get
attached to operating systems, but surprisingly, it still does. If Rust
not only provides certain valuable benefits like memory safety, but can
also be used to create implementations that are faster than those
created in, say, C, it’s really only going to be a matter of time before
it simply becomes an untenable position to block Rust from, say, the
Linux kernel. Progress has a tendency to find a way, especially the more
substantial the benefits get, and as studies show, even only writing new
code in memory-safe languages provides substantial benefits. In other
words, more and more projects will simply switch over to Rust for new
code where it makes sense, whether Rust haters want it or not. There
will be enough non-Rust code to write and maintain, though, so I don’t
think people will be out of a job any time soon because they refuse to
learn Rust, but to me as an outsider, the Rust hate seems to grow more
and more irrational by the day.</p>

reaffirms it won’t remove Manifest v2 support from Firefox</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-26, from: OS News</p>
<p>Mozilla has officially reiterated that it’s going to keep offering
support for both Manifest v2 and Manifest v3 extensions in Firefox.
Google is removing support for Manifest v2 from Chrome, and with it a
feature called blockingWebRequest that is used by ad blockers like
uBlock Origin. Google’s replacement for that feature is more restrictive
and less capable, and as such, uBlock Origin no longer works on Chrome.
Firefox, however, will continue supporting both blockingWebRequest and
declarativeNetRequest — giving developers more flexibility and keeping
powerful privacy tools available to users. ↫ Scott DeVaney and Ed
Sullivan There’s a lot to be worried about when it comes to Mozilla’s
future, but on this matter, at least, they’re taking the correct stance
that genuinely puts users first. It’s no surprise Google is using
Manifest v3 as an excuse to nerf adblocking in Chrome, since adblocking
cuts into Google’s most important source of revenue. If you’re still
using Chrome, this alone should be more than enough reason to switch to
Firefox, so you can retain the most optimal form of adblocking. The
various Chromium skins will most likely all lose support for Manifest v2
as well once the code is actually removed from Chromium in June 2025.
Vivaldi announced as such, and unless any of the other Chromium skins
out there decide to fork Chromium and maintain their own version, you
can expect all of them to lose support for Manifest v2 around the same
date. Safari is harder to pin down, since Apple doesn’t make any
statements about future product. For now, it supports both Manifest v2
and v3, and I don’t really see a reason why Apple would remove v2
support.</p>

<h2 id="years-of-incubating-wayland-color-management">12 years of
incubating Wayland color management</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-26, from: OS News</p>
<p>The Wayland color-management protocol extension has landed on Feb
13th, 2025, in upstream wayland-protocols repository in the staging
directory. It was released with wayland-protocols 1.41. The extension
enables proper interactions between traditional (sRGB), Wide Color Gamut
(WCG), and High Dynamic Range (HDR) image sources and displays once
implemented in Wayland compositors and used in applications. Of course,
a protocol is just a language. Two participants need to speak the same
language for the language to be of any use: Wayland compositors and a
component on the application side (e.g., a toolkit library). Major
efforts have been going on in various projects to prove and take
advantage of the protocol, including KWin, Mutter, Weston, wlroots,
GStreamer, GTK, Qt, SDL, Mesa, and mpv. Support in Mesa means that
applications will be able to render and display in HDR by using the
relevant EGL and Vulkan features. ↫ Pekka Paalanen Colour management has
been an important missing piece of the Wayland puzzle, so it’s good to
see this finally released and added to Wayland as a new protocol after
so many years of work. It’s important to note that the work done so far
focuses almost entirely on the entertainment side of things, like
watching video or playing games. The other important side, professional
colour management for things like photo editing or desktop publishing,
is still missing, with the major holdup being measuring physical monitor
response (measuring a reference image displayed on a monitor with a
hardware device).</p>

<h2 id="xcode-phones-home-a-lot-and-that-should-worry-you">Xcode phones
home a lot, and that should worry you</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-25, from: OS News</p>
<p>I’ve saved the worst for last. For some reason, Xcode phones home to
appstoreconnect.apple.com every time I open an Xcode project. This also
appears to be unnecessary, and I experience no problems after denying
the connections in Little Snitch, so I do! I assume that the connections
send identifying information about the Xcode project to Apple, otherwise
why even make the connections when opening a project? And all of these
connections from Xcode, to every domain, require login to your Apple
Developer account, so Apple is definitely receiving identifying
information about you in any case. In effect, Xcode is a developer
analytics collection mechanism, whether you like it or not, which I
don’t. ↫ Jeff Johnson If, at this point in time, you’re still surprised
Apple doesn’t practice what it preaches, the fault lies pretty much
entirely with you. Anyway, it seems Xcode phones home to Apple quite a
bit, which I doubt is all that unique in the world of commercial
development environments. I honestly don’t think Apple itself doing
anything particularly nefarious with this data, but the fact it’s
collecting it in the first place should still make you think twice about
using Xcode, especially if you’re developing anything even remotely
sensitive. What should really worry you is the fact Tim Cook and Apple
are close allies of Trump and his regime. Xcode is required for
iOS/iPadOS/etc. development, because the App Store requires applications
be built and submitted with it. As such, every iOS developer is sending
substantial amounts of data to Apple during development, which should be
especially concerning for people outside of the US and people who aren’t
straight white males; using Xcode requires an Apple Account, so Apple
knows quite a bit about who is using it. With the breakdown of the rule
of law in the US, all of this data is basically freely accessible to US
authorities, and we’ve seen by now that people like self-styled genius
Elon Musk don’t worry too much about pesky things like the rule of law.
If Musk wants this data, Apple will hand it over. If you’re an Apple
developer, you should stop and think every time you open Xcode. You’re
sending your data straight to a hostile entity. If you’re claiming to
use Apple products because of Apple’s privacy “promises”, Xcode’s data
collection should be a huge worry for you.</p>

gives OEMs the option of 8 years of Android updates</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-25, from: OS News</p>
<p>Starting with Android smartphones running on the Snapdragon 8 Elite
Mobile Platform, Qualcomm Technologies now offers device manufacturers
the ability to provide support for up to eight consecutive years of
Android software and security updates. Smartphones launching on new
Snapdragon 8 and 7-series mobile platforms will also be eligible to
receive this extended support. ↫ Mike Genewich I mean, good news of
course, but Qualcomm has a history of making empty promises, so I’ll see
it when I believe it. Also note that this news doesn’t mean every
Snapdragon 8 Elite Android device will get eight years of updates – it
just means OEMs are able to offer such support now, not that they’ll
actually do it. Considering it’s usually the OEMs refusing to offer
updates, I wonder just how big the actual impact of this news will be.
In any event, this includes both regular Android updates as well as two
Android Common Kernel upgrades, which are required to meet this eight
year window. If you want to get into the nitty-gritty about Android and
the Android Common Kernels, the official Android documentation has more
details.</p>

is no longer safe to move our governments and societies to US
clouds</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-24, from: OS News</p>
<p>We now have the bizarre situation that anyone with any sense can see
that America is no longer a reliable partner, and that the entire US
business world bows to Trump’s dictatorial will, but we STILL are doing
everything we can to transfer entire governments and most of our own
businesses to their clouds. Not only is it scary to have all your data
available to US spying, it is also a huge risk for your
business/government continuity. From now on, all our business processes
can be brought to a halt with the push of a button in the US. And not
only will everything then stop, will we ever get our data back? Or are
we being held hostage? This is not a theoretical scenario, something
like this has already happened. ↫ Bert Hubert The cold and harsh reality
is that the alliance between the United States and Europe, the
single-most powerful alliance in human history, is over. Voters in the
United States prefer their country ally itself with the brutal and
genocidal dictator of Russia, instead of being allied with the
democratic and free nations of Europe. That’s their choice to make,
their consequences to face, and inevitably, their cross to bear.
Governments in Europe have not yet fully accepted that they can no
longer rely on the United States for, well, anything. Whether it be
existential, like needing to shore up defense spending and possibly
unifying European militaries, or something more mundane, like which
computer systems European governments use, the United States should be
treated in much the same way as Russia or China. Europe has to fend for
itself, spend on itself, and build for itself, instead of assuming that
the Americans will come through on any “promise” they make. An
unreliable partner like the US is a massive liability. Bert Hubert is
exactly right. European data needs to be stored within European borders.
Just as we wouldn’t store our data on servers owned or controlled by the
Chinese government, we shouldn’t be storing our data on servers owned or
controlled by the US government. The general European public is already
changing its buying habits – it’s time our governments do so too.</p>

<h2 id="sailfish-os-5.0-released-for-all-supported-devices">Sailfish OS
5.0 released for all supported devices</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-24, from: OS News</p>
<p>Sailfish OS 5.0, originally released late last year as part of the
new Jolla C2 Community Phone, will now be pushed to all Sailfish OS
devices. There have been several other minor releases since the original
release, so if you’re running Sailfish OS on something other than the
C2, you’re getting a release with some more bugfixes and improvements.
The main improvement is an upgrade to Gecko ESR91, with work underway to
move to ESR102 – this is far from the latest release, but sticking to
ESR releases seems like a wise idea for a smaller team. This release
also upgrades the Android application support to Android 13 (API level
33), and adds the microG 0.3.6 enablers. There’s Wireguard support now,
call blocking, and new landscape view for a variety of applications.
Incidentally, I was one of the first people to publish a review of the
original Jolla Phone, exactly 11 years ago in 2014. Since I was such an
early adopter, I have the The First One version, and it just so happens
I’m also one of the very few people who actually received the Jolla
Tablet, after being an extremely early backer of that device, too. I
still have both of them, and especially the Jolla Phone I used as my
main device for quite a while – half a year to a year, or so – before
going back to Android. I’m glad Sailfish OS is still going, and I’m
definitely interested in giving this new release a go. I would need to
buy the Jolla C2 Community Phone, and if finances allow, I may actually
do so. In case you want to help, feel free to become an OSNews Patreon

<h2 id="microsoft-improves-windows-11s-start-menu-somewhat">Microsoft
improves Windows 11’s Start menu somewhat</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-24, from: OS News</p>
<p>Microsoft seems to be addressing some of the oddities with the
Windows 11 Start menu, finally adding basic views that should’ve been in
Windows 11 since the very start. We’re introducing two new views to the
“All” page in the Start menu: grid and category view. Grid and list view
shows your apps in alphabetical order and category view groups all your
apps into categories, ordered by usage. This change is gradually rolling
out so you may not see it right away. We plan to begin rolling this out
to Windows Insiders who are receiving updates based on Windows 11,
version 24H2 in the Dev and Beta Channels soon. ↫ Amanda Langowski and
Brandon LeBlanc These new views are very welcome, but sadly, you still
can’t set them as the default view in the Start menu. You’re still
forced to use whatever that default view is, and click on “All” to get
to these new views, instead of being available right as you open the
Start menu. I messed around with Windows 11 on my XPS 13 9370 for a few
weeks as I waited for a review laptop to arrive, and I couldn’t last for
a few hours without buying a replacement for the Start menu that allowed
me to have a working, non-terrible menu that I could configure to my own
needs. It’s wild to me that such an iconic element of the Windows user
interface is in such a dire, unliked state. We all know Windows seems to
be a in a bit of a rut, with Microsoft investing more in nonsense like
“AI” and ads in the operating system than in actually listening to users
and improving their experience. It’s been roughly thirty years since the
introduction of the Start menu, and the original one from Windows 95 is
still superior to whatever’s in Windows now. Wild.</p>

<h2 id="the-dos-3.3-sys.com-bug-hunt">The DOS 3.3 SYS.COM bug hunt!</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-24, from: OS News</p>
<p>Last year somebody reported a problem with the DOS 3.3 SYS.COM
command when used with NetDrive. They started with a valid FAT12 image,
ran SYS.COM to make it bootable, and then they were not able to mount
the image using NetDrive again. Running SYS.COM against the image had
broken something. Besides copying the operating system’s hidden files to
the target drive letter, SYS.COM also copies some boot code into the
first sector of the disk. In general it does not make sense to run it
against a NetDrive image because you already had to boot DOS to mount
the image, but it should not hurt anything. So I decided to have a look
at what was going on. ↫ Michael Brutman A good old classic bug hunt in
some retro DOS code from roughly 1987. This one’s a bit more technical
and in-depth than these things usually are, and quite a bit of it goes
over my head, but I’m sure since most of you are much smarter than I am,
you’ll do a better job understanding what’s going on.</p>

<h2 id="illumos-on-sparc-possible-but-problematic">Illumos on SPARC:
possible, but problematic</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-23, from: OS News</p>
<p>While SPARC may no longer be supported by the main Illumos project,
it still works and is still viable. This page brings together a variety
of information regarding Illumos on SPARC, not necessarily limited to
Tribblix. ↫ Tribblix website It seems running Tribblix – and other
Illumos-based distributions – on SPARC is still possible, but there are
some serious limitations anyone who has tried to use even slightly older
operating systems will be fairly familiar with. For instance, since
there’s no Rust for Illumos on SPARC, Firefox and other applications
that use it are not available, and Tribblix in particular no longer
builds Pale Moon (or LibreOffice). Rust is available on Solaris 11,
though, so it may be possible to bring it to Illumos. In a similar vein,
Go also isn’t available for SPARC either. As far as hardware support
goes, it’s a bit of a mixed bag, as systems that should work do, in
fact, not, and even systems that do work run into a very familiar
problem: graphics card support is a big issue. This is a problem
plaguing X.org on any outdated or sidelined architecture, and it seems
Illumos is also affected. Obviously, this greatly reduces the usefulness
of Illumos on workstations, but is less of an issue on servers. You’ll
run into the same problem when trying to run NetBSD, OpenBSD, or Linux
in, say, PA-RISC hardware. Of course, the problem is both a lack of
people interested in and capable of contributing to keeping stuff
running on older architectures, further spurred on by a dwindling supply
of hardware available at reasonable prices. Sad, but there isn’t much
that can be done about it.</p>
