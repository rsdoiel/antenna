id="a-new-powerpc-board-with-support-for-amiga-os-4-and-morphos-is-on-its-way">A
new PowerPC board with support for Amiga OS 4 and MorphOS is on its
way</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-23, from: OS News</p>
<p>The Amiga, a once-dominant force in the personal computer world,
continues to hold a special place in the hearts of many. But with
limited next-gen hardware available and dwindling AmigaOS4 support, the
future of this beloved platform seemed uncertain. That is, until four
Dutch passionate individuals, Dave, Harald, Paul, and Marco, decided to
take matters into their own hands. Driven by a shared love for the Amiga
and a desire to see it thrive, they embarked on an ambitious project: to
create a new, low-cost next-gen Amiga mainboard. ↫ Mirari’s Our Story
page Experience has taught me to be… Careful of news of new hardware
from the Amiga world, but for once I have strong reasons to believe this
one is actually the real deal. The development story – from the initial
KiCad renders to the first five, fully functional prototype boards –
seems to be on track, software support for Amiga OS is in development,
Linux is working great already, and since today, MorphOS also boots on
the board. It’s called the Mirari, and it’s very Dutch. So, what are we
looking at here? The Mirari is a micro-ATX board, sporting either a
PowerPC T10x2 processor (2-4 e5500 cores) up to 1.5GHz or a PowerPC
T2081 processor (4 dual-threaded e6500 cores with Altivec 2.0) up to
1.8GHz, both designed by NXP in The Netherlands. It supports DDR3
memory, PCIe 2.0 (3.0 for the 4x slot when using the T2081), SATA and
NVMe, the usual array of USB 2.0 and 3.2 ports, audio jacks, Ethernet,
and so on. No, this is not a massive powerhouse that can take on the
latest x86 or ARM machines, but it’s more than enough to power Amiga OS
4 or MorphOS, and aims to be actually affordable. Being at the prototype
stage means they’re not for sale quite yet, but the fact they have a
100% yield so far and are comfortable enough to send one of the
prototypes to a MorphOS developer, who then got MorphOS booting rather
quickly, is a good sign. I also like the focus on affordability, which
is often a problem in the Amiga world. I hope they make it to
production, because I want one real bad.</p>

convinced Solaris uses systemd</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-23, from: OS News</p>
<p>Who doesn’t love a bug bounty program? Fix some bugs, get some money
– you scratch my back, I pay you for it. The CycloneDX Rust (Cargo)
Plugin decided to run one, funded by the Bug Resilience Program run by
the Sovereign Tech Fund. That is, until “AI” killed it. We received
almost entirely AI slop reports that are irrelevant to our tool. It’s a
library and most reporters didn’t even bother to read the rules or even
look at what the intended purpose of the tool is/was. This caused a lot
of extra work which is why we decided to abandon the program. Thanks AI.
↫ Lars Francke On a slightly related note, I had to do search the web
today because I’m having some issues getting OpenIndiana to boot
properly on my mini PC. For whatever reason, starting LightDM fails when
booting the live USB, and LightDM’s log is giving some helpful error
messages. So, I searched for “failed to get list of logind seats”
openindiana, and Google’s automatic “AI Overview” ‘feature’, which takes
up everything above the fold so is impossible to miss, confidently told
me to check the status of the logind service… With systemctl. We’ve
automated stupidity.</p>

id="home-assistant-deprecates-core-and-supervised-installation-methods-and-32bit-systems">Home
Assistant deprecates Core and Supervised installation methods and 32bit
systems</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-23, from: OS News</p>
<p>We are today officially deprecating two installation methods and
three legacy CPU architectures. We always strive to have Home Assistant
run on almost anything, but sometimes we must make difficult decisions
to keep the project moving forward. Though these changes will only
affect a small percentage of Home Assistant users, we want to do
everything in our power to make this easy for those who may need to
migrate. ↫ Franck Nijhof on the Home Assistant blog Home Assistant is
quite popular among the kind of people who read OSNews, and this news
might actually hit our little demographic particularly hard. The legacy
CPU architectures they’re removing support for won’t make much of a
difference, as we’re talking 32bit x86 and 32bit ARM, although that last
one does include version 1 and 2 of the Raspberry Pi, which were quite
popular at the time. Do check to make sure you’re not running your Home
Assistant installation on one of those. The bigger hit is the
deprecation of two installation methods: Home Assistant Core and Home
Assistant’s Supervised installation method. In Core, you’re running it
in a Python environment, and with Supervised, you’re installing the
various components that make up Home Assistant manually. Supervised is
used to install Home Assistant on unsupported operating systems, like
the various flavours of BSD. What this means is that if you are running
Home Assistant on, say, OpenBSD, you’re going to have to migrate soon.
Apparently, these installation methods are not used very often, and are
difficult for Home Assistant to support. These changes do not mean you
can no longer perform these installation methods; it just means they are
not supported, will be removed from the documentation, and new issues
with these methods will not be accepted. Of course, anyone is free to
take over hosting any documentation and guides, as Home Assistant is
open source. Home Assistant generally wants you to use Home Assistant
OS, which is basically a Linux distribution designed to run Home
Assistant, either on real hardware (which is what I do, on an x86 thin
client) or in a container.</p>

id="truenas-uses-ai-for-customer-support-and-of-course-it-goes-horribly-wrong">TrueNAS
uses “AI” for customer support, and of course it goes horribly
wrong</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-23, from: OS News</p>
<p>Let’s check in on TrueNAS, who apparently employ “AI” to handle
customer service tickets. Kyle Kingsbury had to have dealings with
TrueNAS’ customer support, and it was a complete trashfire of
irrelevance and obviously wrong answers, spiraling all the way into
utter lies. The “AI” couldn’t generate its way out of a paper bag, and
for a paying customer who is entitled to support, that’s not a great
experience. Kingsbury concludes: I get it. Support is often viewed as a
cost center, and agents are often working against a brutal, endlessly
increasing backlog of tickets. There is pressure at every level to clear
those tickets in as little time as possible. Large Language Models
create plausible support responses with incredible speed, but their
output must still be reviewed by humans. Reviewing large volumes of
plausible, syntactically valid text for factual errors is exhausting,
time-consuming work, and every few minutes a new ticket arrives.
Companies must do more with less; what was once a team of five support
engineers becomes three. Pressure builds, and the time allocated to
review the LLM’s output becomes shorter and shorter. Five minutes per
ticket becomes three. The LLM gets it mostly right. Two minutes. Looks
good. Sixty seconds. Click submit. There are one hundred eighty tickets
still in queue, and behind every one is a disappointed customer, and
behind that is the risk of losing one’s job. Thirty seconds. Submit.
Submit. The metrics do not measure how many times the system has lied to
customers. ↫ Kyle Kingsbury This time, it’s just about an upgrade
process for a NAS, and the worst possible outcome “AI” generated
bullshit could lead to is a few lost files. Potentially disastrous on a
personal level for the customer involved, but not exactly a massive
problem. However, once we’re talking support for medical devices,
medication, dangerous power tools, and worse, this could – and trust me,
will – lead to injury and death. TrueNAS, for its part, contacted
Kingsbury after his blog post blew up, and assured him that “their
support process does not normally incorporate LLMs”, and that they would
investigate internally what, exactly, happened. I hope the popularity of
Kingsbury’s post has jolted whomever is responsible for customer service
at TrueNAS that farming out customer service to text generators is a
surefire way to damage your reputation.</p>

<h2 id="linux-mint-forks-gnomes-libadwaita-to-add-theme-support">Linux
Mint forks GNOME’s Libadwaita to add theme support</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-22, from: OS News</p>
<p>On numerous occasions, we’ve talked about the issue facing non-GNOME
GTK desktops, like Xfce, MATE, and Cinnamon: the popularity of
Libadwaita. With more and more application developers opting for GNOME’s
Libadwaita because of the desktop environment’s popularity, many popular
GTK applications now look like GNOME applications instead of GTK
applications, and they just don’t mesh well with traditional GTK
desktops. Since Libadwaita is not themeable, applications that use it
can’t really be made to feel at home on non-GNOME GTK desktops, unless
said desktops adopt the entire GNOME design language, handing over
control ovr their GUI design to outsiders in the process. The developers
of Libadwaita, as well as the people behind GNOME, have made it very
clear they do not intend to make Libadwaita themeable, and they are well
within their rights to make that decision. I think it’s a bad decision –
themeing is a crucial accessibility feature – but it’s their project,
their code, and their time, and I fully respect their decision, since
it’s really not up to GNOME to worry about the other GTK desktops. So,
what are the developers of Xfce, MATE, and Cinnamon supposed to do?
Well, how about taking matters into their own hands? Clement Lefebvre,
the lead developer of Linux Mint and its Cinnamon desktop environment,
has soft-forked Libadwaita to add theme support to the library. They’re
calling it LibAdapta. libAdapta is libAdwaita with theme support and a
few extra. It provides the same features and the same look as libAdwaita
by default. In desktop environments which provide theme selection,
libAdapta apps follow the theme and use the proper window controls. ↫
LibAdapta’s GitHub page The reason they consider libAdapta a “soft-fork”
is that all it does is add theme support; they do not intended to
deviate from Libadwaita in any other way, and will follow Libadwaita’s
releases. It will use the current GTK3 theme, and will fallback to the
default Libadwaita look and feel if the GTK3 theme in question doesn’t
have a libadapta-1.0 directory. This seems like a transparent and smart
way to handle it. I doubt it will be long before libAdapta becomes a
default part of a lot of user instructions online, GTK theme developers
will probably add support for it pretty quickly, and perhaps even of a
lot of non-GNOME GTK desktop environments will add it by default. It
will make it a lot easier for, say, the developers of MATE to make use
of the latest Libadwaita applications, without having to either accept a
disjointed, inconsistent user experience, or adopt the GNOME design
language hook, line, and sinker and lose all control over the user
experience they wish to offer to their users. I’m glad this exists now,
and hope it will prove to be popular. I appreciate the pragmatic
approach taken here – a relatively simple fork that doesn’t burden
upstream, without long feature request threads where everybody is
shouting at each other that needlessly spill over onto Fedi. This is how
open source is supposed to work.</p>

<h2 id="ghostbsd-from-usability-to-struggle-and-renewal">GhostBSD: from
usability to struggle and renewal</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-22, from: OS News</p>
<p>This article isn’t meant to be technical. Instead, it offers a
high-level view of what happened through the years with GhostBSD, where
the project stands today, and where we want to take it next. As you may
know, GhostBSD is a user-friendly desktop BSD operating system built
with FreeBSD. Its mission is to deliver a simple, stable, and accessible
desktop experience for users who want FreeBSD’s power without the
complexity of manual setup. I started this journey as a non-technical
user. I dreamed of a BSD that anyone could use. ↫ Eric Turgeon at the
FreeBSD Foundation’s website I’m very glad to see this article published
on the website of the FreeBSD Foundation. I firmly believe that
especially FreeBSD has all the components to become an excellent desktop
alternative to desktop Linux distributions, especially now that the
Linux world is moving fast with certain features and components not
everyone likes. FreeBSD could serve as a valid alternative. GhostBSD
plays an important role in this. It offers not just an easily
installable FreeBSD desktop, but also several tools to make managing
such an installation easier, like in-house graphical user interfaces for
managing Wi-Fi and other networks, backups, updates, installing
software, and more. They also recently moved from UFS to ZFS, and intend
to develop graphical tools to expose ZFS’s features to users. GhostBSD
can always use more contributors, so if you have the skills, interest,
and time, do give it a go.</p>

a highly customisable tiling WM for Windows built with Janet</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-20, from: OS News</p>
<p>Jwno is a highly customizable tiling window manager for Windows
10/11, built with Janet and ❤️. It brings to your desktop magical
parentheses power, which, I assure you, is not suspicious at all, and
totally controllable. ↫ Jwno documentation Yes, it’s a Lisp system, so
open your bag of spare parentheses and start configuring and customising
it, because you’re going to need it if you want to use Jwno to its
fullest. In general, Jwno works as a keyboard driven tiling window
manager. When a new window shows up, it tries to transform the window so
it fits in the layout you defined. You can then use customized key
bindings to modify the layout or manipulate your windows, rather than
drag things around using the mouse. But, since a powerful generic
scripting engine is built-in, you can literally do anything with it. ↫
Jwno documentation It’s incredibly lightweight, comes as a single
executable, integrates perfectly with Windows’ native virtual desktop
and window management features, has support for REPL, and much more.</p>

my own anyway. Eventually, my projects end up being mostly my own tools
and systems, and the engine becomes just a vehicle for a nice UI and
some rendering… At which point, why am I using this engine? What is it
providing me? Why am I letting a tool potentially destroy my ability to
work when they suddenly make unethical and terrible business decisions?
Or push out an update that they require to run my game on consoles, that
also happens to break an entire system in my game, forcing me to rewrite
it? Why am I fighting this thing daily for what essentially becomes a
glorified asset loader and editor UI framework, by the time I’m done
working around their default systems? ↫ Noel Berry Interesting and
definitely unique perspective, as I feel most game developers just pick
one of the existing big engines and work from there. I’m not saying
either option is wrong, but I do feel like the dependence on the popular
engines can potentially harm the game industry as a whole, as it reduced
diversity, drains valuable knowledge and expertise, and leaves
developers – especially smaller ones – at the mercy of a few big
players. Perhaps not every game needs to be made in Unity or Unreal.</p>

<h2 id="on-the-relationship-between-qt-and-kde">On the relationship
between Qt and KDE</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-20, from: OS News</p>
<p>Volker Hilsheimer, chief maintainer of the Qt project, says he has
learned lessons from the painful Qt 5 to Qt 6 transition, the importance
of Qt Bridges for using Qt from any language, and the significance of
the relationship with the Linux KDE desktop. ↫ Tim Anderson at Dev Class
Qt plays a significant role in the open source desktop world in
particular, because it’s the framework KDE uses. Hilsheimer notes that
KDE’s role in the Qt community is actually quite important, because not
only is it a source of people learning how to use Qt and who can thus
make contributions to the project, KDE also tends to use the latest Qt
versions, creating a lot of confidence among the wider Qt community to
also adopt the latest versions. The relationship with KDE and Qt is an
interesting one, and sometimes leads to questions about the future
availability of the open source edition of Qt since the Qt Company
licenses Qt under a dual-license structure (both open and proprietary).
To avoid any uncertainty, KDE and Qt have an agreement that covers
pretty much every possible scenario and which is worded to ensure the
availability of Qt as an open source framework. KDE, through the KDE
Free Qt Foundation, has a number rights and options to ensure the
availability of Qt as an open source framework. I’m no lawyer, so I
might get some of the details wrong, but the main points are that if the
Qt Company ever decides to discontinue the open source edition of Qt,
the KDE Free Qt Foundation has the right to release Qt under a BSD-style
license within 12 months. The same applies to any addition to Qt which
are not released as open source; they must be released under an open
source license within 12 months of initial release. This agreement
remains valid in the case of buyouts, mergers, or bankruptcies. This
agreement has existed in one form or another since the late ’90s, and
has survived Qt being owned by Nokia and Digia, as well as various other
organisational changes. Despite the issue of Qt’s ownership coming up
every now and then, the agreement is pretty airtight, and considering
its longevity there’s no reason to be worried about it at all. Still,
this structure is clearly more complex and less straightforward than,
say, the status of GTK and its relationship to GNOME, so it’s not
entirely unreasonable the issue comes up every now and then. I wonder if
we’ll ever see this situation become less complex, without the need for
special agreements. While it wouldn’t make a practical difference, it
would make things less… Legalese.</p>

II at Hot Chips 2024: mainframe with a unique caching strategy</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-19, from: OS News</p>
<p>Mainframes still play a vital role in today, providing extremely high
uptime and low latency for financial transactions. Telum II is IBM’s
latest mainframe processor, and is designed unlike any other server CPU.
It only has eight cores, but runs them at a very high 5.5 GHz and feeds
them with 360 MB of on-chip cache. IBM also includes a DPU for
accelerating IO, along with an on-board AI accelerator. Telum II is
implemented on Samsung’s leading edge 5 nm process node. IBM’s
presentation has already been covered by other outlets. Therefore I’ll
focus on what I feel like is Telum (II)’s most interesting features.
DRAM latency and bandwidth limitations often mean good caching is
critical to performance, and IBM has a often deployed interesting
caching solutions. Telum II is no exception, carrying forward a virtual
L3 and virtual L4 strategy from prior IBM chips. ↫ Chester Lam at Chips
and Cheese If you’ve been keeping track, you can possibly deduce that
I’m bit of a sucker for IBM’s mainframes and big POWER machines. These
Telum II processors are absolutely wild.</p>

<h2 id="two-weeks-with-ar-glasses-and-linux-on-android">Two weeks with
AR glasses and Linux on Android</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-19, from: OS News</p>
<p>I recently learned something that blew my mind; you can run a full
desktop Linux environment on your phone. That’s a graphical environment
via X11 with real window management and compositing, Firefox comfortably
playing YouTube (including working audio), and a status bar with system
stats. It launches in less than a second and feels snappy. ↫ Hold the
Robot In and of itself, this is a neat trick most of us are probably
aware of. Running a full Linux distribution on an Android phone using
chroot is an awesome party trick, but I doubt many people take this
concept to its logical conclusion by connecting it up to a display,
keyboard, and mouse, and use it as their mobile workstation. Well, the
author of this article did, and he took it even one step further by
replacing the display part of the logical conclusion with AR glasses.
The AR glasses in question were a pair of Xreal Air 2 Pro, which put a
120Hz 1080p display in front of your eyes using Sony micro-OLED panels.
This will create the illusion of a 130″ screen with a 46° field of view,
from a pair of glasses that honestly do not feel that much more massive
than regular sunglasses or some of the thicker glasses frames some
people like. I’m honestly kind of impressed this is possible these days.
Add in a keyboard and mouse, and you’ve got a mobile workstation that
takes up very little space, especially since you’re carrying your phone
with you at all times anyway. Of course, you have to be comfortable with
using Linux – no Windows or macOS here – and the software side of the
equation requires more setup and fiddling than I thought it would, but
the end result is exactly like using a regular Linux desktop, but on
your phone and a pair of AR glasses instead of on a laptop or desktop.
If I had the cash to throw around on fun side projects like this (you
can help with that, actually, through Ko-Fi donations), I would totally
order a pair of these Xreal glasses to try this out.</p>

releases WSL as open source, announces CLI text editor to replace the
MS-DOS Editor</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-19, from: OS News</p>
<p>Today we’re very excited to announce the open-source release of the
Windows Subsystem for Linux. This is the result of a multiyear effort to
prepare for this, and a great closure to the first ever issue raised on
the Microsoft/WSL repo: Will this be Open Source? · Issue #1 ·
microsoft/WSL. That means that the code that powers WSL is now available
on GitHub at Microsoft/WSL and open sourced to the community! You can
download WSL and build it from source, add new fixes and features and
participate in WSL’s active development. ↫ Pierre Boulay at the Windows
Blogs Windows Subsystem for Linux seems like a relatively popular choice
for people who want a modern, Linux-based development environment but
are stuck using Windows. I’m happy to see Microsoft releasing it as open
source, which is no longer something to be surprised by at this point in
time. It leaves one to wonder how long it’s going to be before more
parts of Windows will be released as open source, since it could allow
Microsoft’s leadership to justify some serious job cuts. I honestly have
no idea how close to the real thing Windows Subsystem for Linux is, and
if it can actually fully replace a proper Linux installation, with all
the functionality and performance that entails. I’m no developer, have
no interest in Windows, so I’ve never actually tried it. I’d love to
hear some experiences from all of you. Aside from releasing WSL as open
source, Microsoft also released a new command-line text editor – simply
called Edit. It’s also open source, in its early stages, and is
basically the equivalent of Nano. It turns out 32bit versions of Windows
up until Windows 10 still shipped with the MS-DOS Editor, but obviously
that one needed a replacement. It already has support for multiple
documents, mouse support, and a few more basic features.</p>

how user-hostile Windows and macOS are, is it any wonder people long for
computers from the ’80s and ’90s?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-19, from: OS News</p>
<p>Every so often people yearn for a lost (1980s or so) era of ‘single
user computers’, whether these are simple personal computers or high end
things like Lisp machines and Smalltalk workstations. It’s my view that
the whole idea of a 1980s style “single user computer” is not what we
actually want and has some significant flaws in practice. ↫ Chris
Siebenmann I think the premise of this entire article is flawed, and
borders on being a strawman argument. I honestly don’t think there’s
many people out there who genuinely and seriously want to use an ’80s
home computer for all their computing tasks, but this article seems to
think that there are. Virtually every single person expressing interest
in and a desire for classic computers does so from a point of nostalgia,
as a learning experience, or as a hobby. They’re definitely not
interested in using any of those ’80s machine to do their banking or to
collaborate with their colleagues. Additionally, the problems and issues
people have with modern computing platforms is not that they are too
complex, but that they are no longer designed with the user in mind.
Windows, macOS, iOS; they’re all first and foremost designed to extract
money from you through ads, upsells, nag screens, and similar anti-user
features, and it’s those things that people are sick of. Coincidentally,
they are all things we didn’t have to deal with back in the ’80s and
’90s. In other words, remove the user-hostility from modern operating
systems, and people wouldn’t complain about them so much. Which seems
rather obvious, doesn’t it? It’s why using a Linux desktop like Fedora
is such a breath of fresh air. There’s no upsells for cloud storage or
streaming services, no restrictions on what I can and cannot install to
protect some multitrillion euro company’s revenue streams, no ads and
nag screens infesting my operating system – it’s just an operating
system waiting for me to tell it what it do, and then it does it. It’s
wild how increasingly revolutionary that’s becoming. Whenever I am
forced to interact with Windows 11 or whatever the current version of
macOS is, I feel such a profound and deep sadness for what they’ve
become, and it seems only natural to me that this sadness is fueling a
longing for back when these systems weren’t so user-hostile.</p>

were the MS-DOS programs that the moricons.dll icons were intended
for?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-18, from: OS News</p>
<p>Last time, we looked at the legacy icons in progman.exe. But what
about moricons.dll? Here’s a table of the icons that were present in the
original Windows 3.1 moricons.dll file (in file order) and the programs
that Windows used the icons for. As with the icons in progman.exe, these
icons are mapped from executables according to the information in the
APPS.INF file. ↫ Raymond Chen These icons age like a fine wine. They’re
clear, well-designed, easy to read, and make extraordinary good use of
the limited amount of available pixels. Icons from Mac OS, BeOS, OS/2,
and a few others from the same era also look timeless, and I wish modern
designers learned a thing or two from these.</p>
