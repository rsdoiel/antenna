government’s attack on free speech, science, and research is causing a
brain drain</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-26, from: OS News</p>
<p>How do you create a brain drain and lose your status as eminent
destination for scientists and researchers? The United States seems to
be sending out questionnaires to researchers at universities and
research institutes outside of the United States, asking them about
their political leanings. Dutch universities are strongly advising Dutch
researches not to respond to the questionnaires, and warn that they are
designed to stifle free speech and independent research through
intimidation. Universities of the Netherlands (UNL) has also warned
researchers about the questionnaire. The USGS questionnaire asks, for
example, whether the researcher’s organisation works with ‘entities
associated with communist, socialist, or totalitarian parties’, whether
the research project has taken ‘appropriate measures’ to ‘defend against
gender ideology’ and whether the project has ‘measurable benefits for US
domestic industries, workforce, or economic sectors’. ↫ Universiteit
Leiden Researchers trying to enter the United States are also facing
intimidation tactics, with the United States government going so far as
to refuse entry to scientists critical of the Trump regime: A French
scientist was denied entry to the US this month after immigration
officers at an airport searched his phone and found messages in which he
had expressed criticism of the Trump administration, said a French
minister. “I learned with concern that a French researcher who was
traveling to a conference near Houston was denied entry to the United
States before being expelled,” Philippe Baptiste, France’s minister of
higher education and research, said in a statement on Monday to Agence
France-Presse published by Le Monde. ↫ Robert Mackey at the Guardian
Being denied entry is one thing – being arrested and sent to a string of
prisons is another, like this Canadian woman: Our next stop was Arizona,
the San Luis Regional Detention Center. The transfer process lasted 24
hours, a sleepless, grueling ordeal. This time, men were transported
with us. Roughly 50 of us were crammed into a prison bus for the next
five hours, packed together – women in the front, men in the back. We
were bound in chains that wrapped tightly around our waists, with our
cuffed hands secured to our bodies and shackles restraining our feet,
forcing every movement into a slow, clinking struggle. ↫ Jasmine Mooney
at the Guardian If you’re a scientist or researcher planning on going to
a conference in the US (or, say, a developer wanting to go to a tech
conference), you should reconsider. Even if your papers are in order,
you could end up on a plane to a concentration camp in El Salvador
before you can even call a lawyer – while being told that any judge
standing up for your rights should be impeached. The United States’ war
on free speech, science, and research goes far beyond intimidating
individual scientists and researchers. The Trump regime is actively
erasing and deleting entire fields of science, most notably anything
involving things like climate and gender, and openly attacking and
cutting funding to universities that disagree with the Trump regime.
Almost immediately after being sworn in as president on 20 January,
Trump put his signature to piles of executive orders cancelling or
freezing tens of billions of dollars in funding for research and
international assistance, and putting the seal on thousands of lay-offs.
Orwellian restrictions have been placed on research, including bans on
studies that mention particular words relating to sex and gender, race,
disability and other protected characteristics. ↫ Nature US President
Donald Trump’s latest war on the climate includes withdrawing support
for any research that mentions the word. He has also launched a purge on
government websites hosting climate data, in an apparent attempt to make
the evidence disappear. ↫ Corey J. A. Bradshaw at The Conversation The
Trump administration has fired hundreds of workers at the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), the US’s pre-eminent
climate research agency housed within the Department of Commerce, the
Guardian has learned. “There is no plan or thought into how to continue
to deliver science or service on weather, severe storms and events,
conservation and management of our coasts and ocean life and much more,”
he said. “Let’s not pretend this is about efficiency, quality of work or
cost savings because none of those false justifications are remotely
true.” ↫ Dharna Noor and Gabrielle Canon at the Guardian Intimidating
current scientists isn’t enough, either – the scientists of the future
must also suffer: US President Donald Trump has signed an executive
orderto dismantle the Department of Education, fulfilling a campaign
pledge and a long-cherished goal of some conservatives. In its
statement, the American Federation of Teachers said: “No-one likes
bureaucracy, and everyone’s in favour of more efficiency, so let’s find
ways to accomplish that. “But don’t use a ‘war on woke’ to attack the
children living in poverty and the children with disabilities.” ↫ Ana
Faguy at the BBC But what about intimidating university students who
don’t fall in line with the regime? Well, we can’t forget about those,
now, can we? After immigration agents detained Columbia University
graduate student Mahmoud Khalil over his involvement in pro-Palestine
protests on campus, President Donald Trump promised it was just the
beginning. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has since arrested
at least two more students who are in the country on visas — one of whom
had recently sued the Trump administration on First Amendment grounds. ↫
Gaby Del Valle at The Verge A Cornell University PhD student earlier
this month sued the Trump administration seeking to stop the president’s
order aimed at foreign students accused of “antisemitism”. Days later,
lawyers at the justice department emailed to request that the student
“surrender” to immigration officials ↫ Maanvi Singh at the Guardian
These are just a small selection of stories, and I could’ve picked a
dozen more still if I wanted to. The point should be squarely (roundly?)
driven home by now: the United States government seems to be doing
everything in its power to scare off the very people an economy based on
science,</p>

<h2 id="kde-developers-show-off-sddm-replacement">KDE developers show
off SDDM replacement</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-26, from: OS News</p>
<p>KDE’s login manager, SDDM, has its share of problems, and as such, a
number of KDE developers are working on replacement to fix many of these
long-standing issues. So, what exactly is wrong with SDDM as it exists
today? With SDDM, power management is reinvented from scratch with
bespoke configuration. We can’t integrate with Plasma’s network
management, power management, volume controls, or brightness controls
without reinventing them in the desktop-agnostic backend. SDDM was
already having to duplicate too much functionality we have in KDE, which
was very frustrating when we’re left maintaining it. ↫ David Edmundson
On top of that, theming is also a big issue with SDDM, as it doesn’t
adopt any of the existing Plasma themes, wallpapers, and so on, forcing
users to manually makes thse changes for SDDM, and forcing theme
developers to make custom themes just for SDDM instead of it just
adopting Plasma’s settings. The new login manager they’re working on
will instead make use of existing Plasma components and be brought up
like Plasma itself, too. For now, the SDDM replacement is roughly at
feature parity with SDDM, but it’s by no means ready for widespread
adoption by distributions or users. Developers interested in trying it
out can do so, though, and as it mostly looks like the existing default
SDDM setup, you won’t even notice anything in day-to-day use.</p>

<h2 id="google-moves-all-android-development-behind-closed-doors">Google
moves all Android development behind closed doors</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-26, from: OS News</p>
<p>Up until now, Google developed several components of Android out in
the open, as part of AOSP, while developing everything else behind
closed doors, only releasing the source code once the final new Android
version was released. This meant that Google had to merge the two
branches, which lead to problems and issues, so Google decided it’s now
moving all development of Android behind closed doors. What will change
is the frequency of public source code releases for specific Android
components. Some components like the build system, update engine,
Bluetooth stack, Virtualization framework, and SELinux configuration are
currently AOSP-first, meaning they’re developed fully in public. Most
Android components like the core OS framework are primarily developed
internally, although some features, such as the unlocked-only storage
area API, are still developed within AOSP. Beginning next week, all
Android development will occur within Google’s internal branches, and
the source code for changes will only be released when Google publishes
a new branch containing those changes. As this is already the practice
for most Android component changes, Google is simply consolidating its
development efforts into a single branch. ↫ Mishaal Rahman at Android
Authority This brings up a very old debate: if development happens
entirely behind closed doors, with only the occasional code drop, is the
software in question really open source? Technically, the answer is
obviously ‘yes’ – there’s no requirement that development take place in
public. However, I’m fairly sure that when most people think of open
source, they think not only of occasionally throwing chunks of code over
the proverbial corporate walls, but also of open development, where
everybody is free to contribute, pipe in, and follow along. Clearly,
this move makes Android more closed, not less so, and it follows in a
long string of changes Google has made to Android that make it ever
harder to consider AOSP, the Android Open Source Project, a capable,
modern mobile operating system. The Android fork of the Linux kernel
will always be properly open, of course, but I have my doubts Android in
and of itself will remain open source in the narrow definition for much
longer, and even if it does, you have to wonder how much value it will
have. I mean, Darwin, the open source base underneath macOS and iOS, is
technically open source, but nobody cares because Apple made it pretty
much worthless in and of itself. Anything of value is stripped out and
not only developed behind closed doors, but also not released as open
source, ensuring Darwin is nothing but a curiosity we sometimes remember
exists. Android could be heading in the same direction. My biggest worry
are Android ROMs, most notably for me personally GrapheneOS. I honestly
have no idea how this will impact such projects.</p>

<p>Long-sought auroral glow finally emerges under Webb’s powerful gaze
For the first time, NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope has captured
bright auroral activity on Neptune. Auroras occur when energetic
particles, often originating from the Sun, become trapped in a planet’s
magnetic field and eventually strike the upper atmosphere. The energy
released during these collisions creates […]</p>

<p>date: 2025-03-25, from: OS News</p>
<p>Some more light reading: While it was already established that the
open source supply chain was often the target of malicious actors, what
is stunning is the amount of energy invested by Jia Tan to gain the
trust of the maintainer of the xz project, acquire push access to the
repository and then among other perfectly legitimate contributions
insert – piece by piece – the code for a very sophisticated and
obfuscated backdoor. This should be a wake up call for the OSS
community. We should consider the open source supply chain a high value
target for powerful threat actors, and to collectively find
countermeasures against such attacks. In this article, I’ll discuss the
inner workings of the xz backdoor and how I think we could have
mechanically detected it thanks to build reproducibility. ↫ Julien Malka
It’s a very detailed look at the situation and what Nix could to prevent
it in the future.</p>

<p>date: 2025-03-24, from: OS News</p>
<p>What if you want to use a web browser like Dillo, which lacks
JavaScript support and can’t play audio or video inside the browser?
Dillo doesn’t have the capability to play audio or video directly from
the browser, however it can easily offload this task to other programs.
This page collects some examples of how to do watch videos and listen to
audio tracks or podcasts by using an external player program. In
particular we will cover mpv with yt-dlp which supports YouTube and
Bandcamp among many other sites. ↫ Dillo website The way Dillo handles
this feels very UNIX-y, in that it will call an external program – mpv
and yt-dlp, for instance – to play a YouTube from an “Open in mpv”
option in the right-click menu for a link. It’s nothing earth-shattering
or revolutionary, of course, but I very much appreciate that Dillo bakes
this functionality right in, allowing you to define any such actions and
add them to the context menu.</p>

<h2 id="reactos-0.4.15-released">ReactOS 0.4.15 released</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-22, from: OS News</p>
<p>It’s been over three years since the last ReactOS release, but today,
in honour of the first commit to the project by the oldest, still active
contributor, the project released ReactOS 0.4.15. Of course, there’s
been a steady stream of nightly releases, so it’s not like the project
stalled or anything, but having a proper release is always nice to have.
We are pleased to announce the release of ReactOS 0.4.15! This release
offers Plug and Play fixes, audio fixes, memory management fixes,
registry healing, improvements to accessories and system tools including
Notepad, Paint, RAPPS, the Input Method Editor, and shell improvements.
↫ ReactOS 0.14.5 release announcement There’s a lot in this one, as the
long gap between releases indicates. Thanks to the major changes in the
plug and play subsystem of the kernel, ReactOS now supports more third
party drivers, and it can now boot from USB and chipsets with EHCI,
OHCI, and UHCI controllers. The open source AC’97 driver from the
Windows Driver Kit has also been ported to ReactOS to enable sound on
VirtualBox and old motherboards. The open source FAT driver from the
same WDK has also been ported, which is a massive improvement over the
old one. ReactOS can now also make use of custom IMEs, ZIP archive
support has been integrated into the shell, and a new default visual
style has been chosen. There’s a lot more in this release, though, and
since it was branched over six months ago, there are a lot of
improvements from since that time that are not yet part of this release,
like a graphical installers, UEFI and SMP support, new NTFS driver, and
a ton more. In other words – don’t let the long time between releases
fool you; there’s a lot going on in the ReactOS world.</p>

<h2 id="nvidia-linux-gpu-driver-ported-to-haiku">Nvidia Linux GPU driver
ported to Haiku</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-22, from: OS News</p>
<p>Nvidia releasing its Linux graphics driver as open source is already
bearing fruit for alternative operating systems. As many people already
knows, Nvidia published their kernel driver under MIT license: GitHub –
NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules: NVIDIA Linux open GPU kernel module
source (I will call it NVRM). This driver is very portable and its
platform-independent part can be compiled for Haiku with minor effort
(but it need to implement OS-specific binding code to be actually
useful). This is very valuable for Haiku because Linux kernel GPU
drivers are very hard to port and it heavily depends on Linux kernel
internals. Unfortunately userland OpenGL/Vulkan driver source code is
not published. But as part of Mesa 3D project, new Vulkan driver “NVK”
is being developed and is functional already. Mesa NVK driver is using
Nouveau as kernel driver, so it can’t be directly used with NVRM kernel
driver. NVK source code provides platform abstraction that allows to
implement support of other kernel drivers such as NVRM. I finally
managed to make initial port NVRM kernel driver to Haiku and added
initial NVRM API support to Mesa NVK Vulkan driver, so NVRM and NVK can
work together. Some simple Vulkan tests are working. ↫ X512 on the Haiku
forums Incredibly impressive, and a huge milestone for the Haiku
operating system. It supports any Nvidia GPU from the Turing
architecture, which I think means Nvidia RTX 20xx and newer, since they
have a required microcontroller older GPUs do not have. Of course, this
is an early port and a lot of work remains to be done, but it could lead
to huge things for Haiku.</p>

<h2 id="softbank-acquires-ampere-computing">SoftBank acquires Ampere
Computing</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-22, from: OS News</p>
<p>SoftBank Group Corp. today announced that it will acquire Ampere
Computing, a leading independent silicon design company, in an all-cash
transaction valued at $6.5 billion. Under the terms of the agreement,
Ampere will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of SoftBank Group and
retain its name. As part of the transaction, Ampere’s lead investors –
Carlyle and Oracle – are selling their respective positions in Ampere. ↫
SoftBank and Ampere Computing press release Despite not really knowing
what SoftBank does and what their long-term goals are – I doubt anyone
does – I hope this at the very least provides Ampere with the funds
needed to expand its business. At this point, the only serious options
for Arm-based hardware are either Apple or Qualcomm, and we could really
use more players. Ampere’s hardware is impressive, but difficult to buy
and expensive, and graphics card support is patchy, at best. What Ampere
needs is more investment, and more OEMs picking up their chips. An
Ampere workstation is incredibly high on my list of machines to test for
OSNews (perhaps a System76 model?), and it’d be great if economies of
scale worked to bring the prices down, possibly allowing Ampere to
developer cheaper, more affordable variants for us mere mortals, too. I
would love to build an Arm workstation in much the same way we build
regular x86 PCs today, but I feel like that’s still far off. I have no
idea if SoftBank is the right kind of company to make this possible, but
one can dream.</p>
