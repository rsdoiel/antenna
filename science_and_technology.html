<h2 id="the-most-microsoft-support-document-of-all-time">The most
Microsoft support document of all time</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-23, from: OS News</p>
<p>I have stumbled upon the most Microsoft support document of all time.
Support for the Microsoft Store installation type of Microsoft 365 Apps
is ending. New feature updates will stop in October 2025 and security
updates will end in December 2026. If you have the Microsoft Store
installation type of Microsoft 365 Apps, you must upgrade to the
Click-to-Run installation type for continuing new features and security
updates. The following steps show how you can upgrade the installation
type of Microsoft 365 products on a PC from the Microsoft Store to
Click-to-Run. ↫ End of support for the Microsoft Store installation type
of Microsoft 365 Apps There is so much to unpack here. First, if you’re
not neck-deep in Microsoft lore, you might not even know what Microsoft
365 Apps even are. Remember Office 365, the subscription version of
Microsoft Office? It’s called Microsoft 365 now, for some inexplicable
reason, but you probably haven’t noticed because it is a stupidly
confusing, nondescript name that nobody out in the real world uses.
Adding to the confusion, in 2022, Microsoft announced it would phase out
the Office name in favour of calling both the subscription version and
the regular, buy-once-run-forever version “Microsoft 365”, but then
changed their mind a year later, and as such, the regular,
buy-once-run-forever version is now still called Office. Oh and there’s
also the “Microsoft 365 Copilot app (formerly Office)” (at Office.com?)
which I think is what used to be called the mobile iOS/Android Office
application, which existed alongside the individual mobile Office
applications on these platforms (because that was a thing, too – maybe
still is?)? I don’t know man, I merely have two university degrees,
which clearly isn’t enough to understand any of this 4D office suite
chess. Anyway, the Microsoft 365 Apps (so the subscription version of
what was temporarily formerly known as Microsoft Office) can be
installed either through the Microsoft Store, which is the application
store bundled with Windows that you never use, or through something
called Click-to-Run. Apparently, Microsoft is discontinuing the
Microsoft Store version of the Microsoft 365 Apps, and is urging
everyone to move to the Click-to-Run version of the Microsoft 365 Apps.
Alright, we’re getting really, really deep into the very darkest
crevices of the Microsoft Cinematic Universe lore now. The Microsoft
Store version of the Microsoft 365 Apps is almost entirely identical to
the Click-to-Run version of the Microsoft 365 Apps, except for one tiny
part: the exact packaging method of the applications. Whereas the
Microsoft Store version is packaged and delivered in Microsoft’s Appx
packaging format (designed for the Universal Windows Platform or UWP),
the Click-to-Run version is packaged and delivered through, well,
Click-to-Run. So, what is that, exactly? Click-to-Run is an entirely
custom application streaming technology specifically designed for and
exclusively used by Microsoft Office. You download a very small
installer, which then proceeds to download the various Microsoft 365
applications like Word, Excel, and so on, which you can then start using
well before the entire download is finished. The technology is similar
to Microsoft App-V. It’s actually remarkably difficult to find detailed
documentation about Click-to-Run, which is odd considering Microsoft is
usually quite decent at providing documentation for its technologies. So
what Microsoft is announcing in this support document is that if you
have Microsoft 365 Apps installed through the Microsoft Store, you’re
going to have to switch to the Click-to-Run version. You can check which
installation type you’re using by going to File &gt; Account (it might
be called Office Account, because everything is made up and nothing is
real) – under Product information locate the About button, where it’ll
list the installation type. If your installation type is Microsoft
Store, you need to switch to the Click-to-Run version to keep receiving
updates. To do so, download the Click-to-Run installer and run it, which
will automatically remove the Microsoft Store version of the Microsoft
365 Apps and replace them with the Click-to-Run versions. The reason
they’re making you do this is that the Click-to-Run version offers
enterprises and corporate customers more control over deployment, update
schedules, configuration options, and so on. The Microsoft Store version
is more suited for normal consumers, but Microsoft doesn’t care about
those, and never has, and never will. Why is Microsoft?</p>

<p>date: 2025-07-23, from: OS News</p>
<p>Wayback, the recently announced tool that will allow you to run a
legacy X11 desktop environment on top of Wayland, has just announced its
first release, version 0.1. As the version number implies, there be
dragons here, but the developers state some of them already use Wayback
on a day-to-day basis. Still, there’s no multi-monitor support yet,
quite a few X.org options are just stubs for now, there’s no
mouse-locking, and so on. Since the initial announcement and the first
progress report a few weeks ago, Wayback has become an official part of
FreeDesktop.org, which indicates the wider desktop Linux community is
definitely interested in what Wayback has to offer. It’s also been split
into several different parts to mimic X.org’s structure, several
distributions have picked it up and packaged it already, and ton more
changes have been made. It definitely seems like Wayback has a good
chance of becoming a simpler, more straightforward replacement for
X.org, greatly reducing the maintenance burden of Linux distributions.
Not having to keep the full legacy X.org stack around alongside Wayland
is going to save a lot of people a lot of time.</p>

<strong>Updated</strong>  A leading 3D printing site has agreed to purge
its library of downloadable gun designs at the urging of Manhattan
District Attorney Alvin Bragg. However, it's unlikely to slow the
proliferation of 3D printed weapons, as many other sites offer
downloadable gun designs and parts.…

<h2 id="aros-continues-centimetering-closer-to-64bit">AROS continues
centimetering closer to 64bit</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-22, from: OS News</p>
<p>The work towards making the 64bit version of AROS a viable choice is
continuing, as is the work on AROS’ web browser, and developer Krzysztof
‘deadwood’ Śmiechowicz gave an update a few days ago detailing the
progress that’s been made – and it’s extensive. First, the beta version
of Odyssey 3.0, the web browser for AROS, can now load a whole slew of
important websites, like YouTube, Google Docs, and Discord, which is a
big deal for an alternative operating system like AROS. Odyssey uses
Apple’s WebKit as its browser engine, and it’s obviously important to
make sure it runs on the 64bit version of AROS. Speaking of 64bit, more
and more applications are being recompiled to add 64bit support, with
the stated goal being to have at least the best application in each
category available in 64bit. A major issue is that certain pieces of
hardware that work in 32bit do not yet work in 64bit. As a temporary
solution, they’re going to make use of the virtualisation route AROS
Portable uses to plug the gaps in 64bit hardware support until such
support is realised. AROS Portable is basically a Linux distribution
that runs a virtual copy of the 32bit version of AROS. It’s clear that a
lot of work is happening in the 64bit space for AROS, which is crucial
for the long-term viability of the project. AROS is still the easiest
and most accessible way to get a taste of an Amiga-like experience since
it runs on plain x86 hardware, so it’s important to keep that dream
alive.</p>

id="freebsd-15.0s-installer-to-gain-option-to-install-a-full-kde-plasma-desktop-environment">FreeBSD
15.0’s installer to gain option to install a full KDE Plasma desktop
environment</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-22, from: OS News</p>
<p>One of the things lacking from the FreeBSD installation routine is
the easy installation of a full desktop experience, from X11 all the way
up to a login manager, desktop environment, and its applications. It
seems this might finally change for FreeBSD 15.0, as the FreeBSD
Foundation’s Laptop Support and Usability Improvements project is
working on adding support for this to bsdinstall, the FreeBSD installer.
Based on a goal set out in this GitHub issue, the way this will work is
that through a set of dialogs (which you can check out on GitLab) in the
FreeBSD installer, the user can select to install KDE, which will then
guide the user through installing the correct graphics driver and adding
users to the video group. Once the installation is finished, the
computer will reboot and load directly into SDDM, allowing you to log
into the installed KDE Plasma desktop environment. For FreeBSD 15.0, our
goal is to extend the FreeBSD installer to offer a minimal KDE-based
desktop as an install option. The initial concept is a low-interaction
installation process that, upon completion, brings the user directly to
a KDE graphical login screen. ↫ FreeBSD Foundation Laptop Update – June
2025 Future plans for desktop users in the FreeBSD installers are more
elaborate, and will include additional desktop environments to choose
from, the ability to install sets of desktop applications during
FreeBSD’s installation, and yes, even opting for Wayland instead of X11,
because FreeBSD developers know which way the wind is blowing. This is
excellent news, and will make installing a FreeBSD-based desktop a lot
easier for a ton of people. Work isn’t fully completed just yet, but
even if the developers miss their FreeBSD 15.0 target, it’ll just move
on to one of the follow-up releases.</p>

rolls out another set of “AI” tools to Windows 11 users</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-22, from: OS News</p>
<p>Ever wanted Windows to monitor what’s on your screen continuously and
ask it to do stuff for you? Well, have I got news for you: Copilot
Vision, as this feature is called, is now rolling out to users in the
US. Copilot Vision on Windows, now available in the U.S., is a new way
to engage with your Windows 11 PC. When you enable it, it can see what
you see on your device and talk to you about it in real time. It acts as
your second set of eyes, able to analyze content, help when you’re lost,
provide insights and answer your questions as you go. Whether you’re
browsing, working or deep in a project, Copilot Vision offers instant
insights and answers. ↫ The Windows Experience Blog team Do note that
Copilot Vision will not keep its data on your device, instead sending it
off to Microsoft. So, if you ever wanted to give Microsoft even more
insight into exactly what you’re doing with your Windows installation,
now’s your chance. Well, if you’re in the US, that is, and some its
capabilities are only available on Snapdragon PCs, not on Intel or AMD
machines. In the same blog post, Microsoft also highlights a few
actually useful features coming to Windows, like a colour picker in the
screenshot tool, the ability to change the lighting in photos, or having
the area selector in the screenshot tool snap to what it thinks is the
important part you wish to actually take a screenshot of. However,
Microsoft is also adding nonsense like sticker generators in Paint, text
generators in Word, and stuff related to Teams that makes me even
happier than I already am that I’m self-employed and work alone. If
you’re in the US, you can get these features now if you wish through
Windows Update.</p>

id="fedora-needs-to-embrace-flathub-and-heres-how-that-could-be-done">Fedora
needs to embrace Flathub, and here’s how that could be done</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-22, from: OS News</p>
<p>Earlier this year, we talked about a peculiar oddity concerning
Flatpaks and Fedora: unlike just about any other distribution, Fedora
maintains its own Flatpak repository, while everyone else just defaults
to Flathub. While there’s a few technical differences between Fedora
Flatpaks and Flathub Flatpaks, the main gist is that the Fedora ones are
built using Fedora’s own RPMs, while Flathub’s are built using different
means. This is an odd situation, since it does not reflect what users
really want – users seem to greatly prefer Flatpaks from Flathub, since
they have fewer bugs, are packaged by the applications’ creators, and
bugs in Flathub Flatpaks can be reported to the actual developers,
whereas bugs in Fedora Flatpaks generally cannot. As such, Fedora users
are often surprised to learn that the Flatpak they installed came from
Fedora instead of Flathub. Now, since Fedora’s long-term goal is to make
their immutable, Flatpak-focused variants the default, this situation
needs to be addressed. As such, Fedora and GNOME developer Michael
Catanzaro has published an incredibly detailed article outlining all the
issues and possible solutions and courses of action. The basic gist is
that before Fedora can consider switching from its own Flatpak
repository to Flathub, a number of shortcomings in Flathub must be
addressed: Some of these points are fairly obvious, but let’s go over
them anyway. A lot of binaries on Flathub are pre-built in that they are
not built using Flathub’s infrastructure, and as such, you don’t know if
anything has been done to the code between, say, the code’s release on
GitHub and the Flatpak you install on your computer. This obviously
needs to change, and ideally, all Flatpaks on Flathub should be
reproducible. End-of-life runtimes should obviously also not be a thing,
for entirely obvious reasons. Currently, a little under a third of
applications on Flathub use end-of-life runtimes, meaning the runtimes
they use are not receiving any security updates. The same applies to
external dependencies packaged inside Flatpaks; they can be outdated
too, but many Flatpaks do not use the designated tool to deal with this
issue. Obviously, holes in the Flatpak sandbox should not exist either,
again for entirely obvious reasons. Catanzaro proposes a number of
solutions to all of these problems, which require work from both Fedora
and Flathub to be implemented. On top of that, even once these issues
are satisfactorily addressed, there’s a debate to be had over the exact
way in which both the traditional and immutable variants of Fedora move
on over to Flathub – the variant I personally like the most is where the
core applications installed by default remain in control of Fedora,
while everything else gets installed from Flathub. Of course, this is
not of much relevance to people who prefer plain, traditional RPMs –
such as myself – to whom Flatpaks are more of a “if all else fails”
option than a default. While the immutable, Flatpak-based variants of
Fedora are definitely on their way to become the default option, the
traditional RPM variants will not be going anywhere, and will remain an
option as well. I think defaulting new users to the immutable variants
is the way to go, even if I personally won’t be using them.</p>

<p>date: 2025-07-21, from: OS News</p>
<p>Microsoft wants to know why, exactly, Windows 11 is slow, so it’s
adding a feature in the latest Insider Preview to collect data when a
Windows 11 machine is experiencing slowness or sluggishness. As part of
our commitment to improving Windows performance, logs are now collected
when your PC has experienced any slow or sluggish performance. Windows
Insiders are encouraged to provide feedback when experiencing PC issues
related to slow or sluggish performance, allowing Feedback Hub to
automatically collect these logs, which will help us root cause issues
faster. Use the Desktop &gt; System Sluggishness category when filing
feedback to allow Feedback Hub to automatically pick up these logs.
These logs are stored locally (%systemRoot%folder) and only sent to
Microsoft via Feedback Hub when feedback is submitted. ↫ Amanda
Langowski and Brandon LeBlanc In case you want to solve performance
problems with Windows 11, just go here and follow the steps, and your
computer will be spry as a Spring chicken in a few minutes. I am very
funny.</p>

<p>Is KDE too much for you? GNOME tries to do too much? Xfce still a bit
too fancy? Do you need something smaller? Even more minimalist? What
about a mere 20 lines of code which provide the absolute barest possible
minimum of window management functionality? You need mwm. This is the
smallest, actually usable window manager I know about. Even TinyWM is
twice as large. However, it doesn’t let you launch programs, or assign
key bindings. mwm does. ↫ Mwm’s GitHub page It will open a window, and
let you switch between windows, that are always fullscreen. No
titlebars, no virtual desktops, no menus, no nothing. This is the true
minimalist’s experience.</p>

<h2 id="an-artificially-complex-xml-schema-as-a-lock-in-tool">An
artificially complex XML schema as a lock-in tool</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-21, from: OS News</p>
<p>The Document Foundation, which developers LibreOffice, is mad at
Microsoft for the levels of complexity in the Microsoft 365 document
format. They claim Microsoft intentionally makes this format’s XML
schema as complex and obtuse as possible to lock users into the
Microsoft Office ecosystem. This artificial complexity is characterised
by a deeply nested tag structure with excessive abstraction, dozens or
even hundreds of optional or overloaded elements, non-intuitive naming
conventions, the widespread use of extension points and wildcards, the
multiple import of namespaces and type hierarchies, and sparse or
cryptic documentation. In the case of the Microsoft 365 document format,
the only characteristic not present is sparse or cryptic documentation,
given that we are talking about a set of documents totalling over 8,000
pages. All the other characteristics are present to a greater or lesser
extent, making life almost impossible for a developer trying to
implement the schema. ↫ Italo Vignoli I feel like this was widely known
already, since I distinctly remember the discussions around the
standardisation process for the Office Open XML file formats. Then, too,
it was claimed that Microsoft’s then-new XML file formats were far more
complex and obtuse than the existing, already standardised OpenDocument
file formats, and that there was no need to push Microsoft’s new file
formats through the process. These days, you might wonder how relevant
all of this still is, but considering vast swaths of the private,
corporate, government, and academic world still run on Microsoft Office
and its default file formats, it’s definitely still a hugely relevant
matter. As an office suite, you are basically required to support Office
Open XML, and if Microsoft is making that more complex and obtuse on
purpose, that’s a form of monopoly abuse that should be addressed.</p>
