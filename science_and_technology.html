<h2 id="new-raspberry-pi-os-switches-everyone-over-to-wayland">New
Raspberry Pi OS switches everyone over to Wayland</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-30, from: OS News</p>
<p>The slow rise of Wayland hasn’t really been slow anymore for years
now, and today another major part of the Linux ecosystem is making the
jump from X to Wayland. So we made the decision to switch. For most of
this year, we have been working on porting labwc to the Raspberry Pi
Desktop. This has very much been a collaborative process with the
developers of both labwc and wlroots: both have helped us immensely with
their support as we contribute features and optimisations needed for our
desktop. After much optimisation for our hardware, we have reached the
point where labwc desktops run just as fast as X on older Raspberry Pi
models. Today, we make the switch with our latest desktop
image: Raspberry Pi Desktop now runs Wayland by default across all
models. ↫ Simon Long Raspberry Pi Desktop already used Wayland on some
of the newer models, through the use of Wayfire. However, it turned out
Wayfire wasn’t a good fit for the older Pi models, and Wayfire’x
development direction would move it even further away from that goal,
which is obviously important to the Raspberry Pi Foundation. They
eventually settled on using labwc instead, which can also be used on
older Pi models. As such, all Pi models will now switch to using Wayland
with the latest update to the operating system. This new update also
brings vastly improved touchscreen support, a rewritten panel
application that won’t keep removed plugins in memory, a new display
configuration utility, and more.</p>

<h2 id="the-osnews-2024-fundraiser-support-osnews-to-keep-it-alive">The
OSNews 2024 fundraiser: support OSNews to keep it alive</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>Do you want OSNews to continue to exist? Do you like the selection of
news items I manage to scrounge up almost every day? Do you want OSNews
free from corporate influence, “AI”-generated nonsense, and the kind of
SEO-optimised blogspam we all despise? Consider supporting OSNews
financially, so I can keep running the site as an independent entity,
free from the forces that make the web shittier every day. There are
several ways you can support OSNews. First, you can become a Patreon.
Being an OSNews Patreon means no more ads on OSNews, access to the
OSNews Matrix room, and some fancy flair on your comments. The goal is
to eventually have enough Patreons supporting us to make us independent
even from regular ads, which means we’ll need to hit at least
€1500-€2000 a month. Once we achieve that, we will turn off ads for
everyone. OSNews is my job, and thus my only source of income, so we can
only turn off ads once community support is high enough to do so. This
is obviously a long-term goal. To help us all get there, I’ve added a
brand new, even higher Patreon tier. If being a Platinum Patreon isn’t
enough for you, you can now move on up and become an Antimatter Patreon
for €50/month. You’ll get all the same benefits as the Platinum tier,
but on top of that, you can opt to have your name permanently displayed
on the frontpage in our sidebar. This tier is really specifically
designed for the most hardcore supporters of OSNews, and can even be
used as a bit of a marketing tool for yourself. By the way, I do not
know where to go after antimatter. What’s rarer and more expensive than
antimatter? Second, you can make an individual donation to OSNews
through Ko-Fi. Recently, my wife, two kids, and I were all hit with, in
order, bronchitis, flu, and then a minor cold. With all of us down and
out, unable to work, our finances obviously took a bit of a hit. My wife
works in home care for the elderly, which isn’t exactly a job with a
fair wage, so any time we can’t work it hits us hard. Individual Ko-Fi
donations have proven to be lifesavers. As such, I’ve set up a Ko-Fo
donation target of €2500, so my wife, kids, and I can build up a bit of
a buffer for emergencies. Creating such a buffer will be a huge load off
our backs. Third, we have official OSNews merch! Our merch store is
filled with a ton of fun products for the operating system connoisseurs
among us, from the basic OSNews T-shirt and mug, to the old-school
ASCII-art OSNews T-shirt and sweatshirt, and finally three unique
terminal T-shirts showing the terminal of MS-DOS, BeOS, and Mac OS X.
Each of the terminal shirts sport the correct colour schemes, text, and
fonts. The pricing has been set up in such a way that for each product
sold, we receive about $8. OSNews has always been a passion project for
everyone involved, and I’d like to continue that. By making sure we’re
independent, free from the forces that are destroying websites left,
right, and centre, OSNews can keep doing what it’s always done: report
on things nobody else covers, without the pressure to post 45 items
about every new iPhone, stupid SEO blogspam nonsense about how to plug
in a USB cable or whatever, or “AI”-generated drudgery. The people
making that possible are all of our Patreons, Ko-Fi donors, and merch
customers. You have no idea how thankful I am for each and every one of
you.</p>

R14.1.3 released, and KDE developers hold impromptu TDE installfest at
Akademy 2024</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>The Trinity Desktop Environment, a fork of the last release in the
KDE 3.x series, has just released their latest version, R14.1.3. Despite
its rather small version number change, it contains some very welcome
new features. TDE started the process of integrating the XDG Desktop
Portal API, which will bring a lot of welcome integration with
applications from the wider ecosystem. There’s also a brand new touchpad
settings module, which was something I was sorely missing when I tried
out TDE a few months ago. Furthermore, there’s of course a ton of
bugfixes and improvements, but also things like support for tiling
windows, some new theme and colour scheme options, and a lot more. Not
too long ago, when KDE’s Akademy 2024 took place, a really fun impromptu
event happened. A number of KDE developers got together – I think in a
restaurant or coffee place – and ended up organising an unplanned TDE
installation party. Several photos floated around Mastodon of KDE
developers using TDE, and after a few fun interactions between KDE and
TDE developers on Mastodon, TDE developers ended up being invited to
next year’s Akademy. We’ll have to wait and see if the schedules line
up, but if any of this can lead to both projects benefiting from some
jolly cooperation, it can only be seen as a good thing. Regardless, TDE
is an excellent project with a very clear goal, and they’re making
steady progress all the time. It’s not a fast-paced environment chasing
the latest and greatest technologies, but instead builds upon a solid
foundation, bringing it into modern world where it makes sense. If you
like KDE 3.x, TDE is going to be perfect for you.</p>

<h2 id="worlds-first-haiku-ransomwaremalware">World’s first Haiku
ransomware/malware</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>There’s many ways to judge if an operating system has made it to the
big leagues, and one of the more unpleasant ones is the availability of
malware. Haiku, the increasingly capable and daily-driveable successor
to BeOS, is now officially a mainstream operating system, as it just had
its first piece of malware. HaikuRansomware is an experimental
ransomware project designed for educational and investigative purposes.
Inspired by the art of poetry and the challenge of cryptography, this
malware encrypts files with a custom extension and provides a ransom
note with a poetic touch. This is a proof of concept aimed to push the
boundaries of how creative ransomware can be designed. ↫
HaikuRansomware’s GitHub page Now this is obviously a bit of a
tongue-in-cheek, experimental kind of thing, but it’s still something
quite unique to happen to Haiku. I’m not entirely sure how the
ransomware is supposed to spread, but my guess would be through social
engineering. With Haiku being a relatively small project, and one
wherein every user runs as root – baron, in BeOS parlance – I’m sure
anything run through social engineering can do some serious damage
without many guardrails in place. Don’t quote me on that, though, as
Haiku may have more advanced guardrails and mitigations in place than
classic BeOS did. This proof-of-concept has no ill intent, and is more
intended as an art project to highlight what you can do with encryption
and ransomware on Haiku today, and I definitely like the art-focused
approach of the author.</p>

<h2 id="whats-new-in-posix-2024-xcu">What’s new in POSIX 2024 – XCU</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-27, from: OS News</p>
<p>As of the previous release of POSIX, the Austin Group gained more
control over the specification, having it be more working group
oriented, and they got to work making the POSIX specification more
modern. POSIX 2024 is the first release that bears the fruits of this
labor, and as such, the changes made to it are particularly interesting,
as they will define the direction of the specification going forwards.
This is what this article is about! Well, mostly. POSIX is composed of a
couple of sections. Notably XBD (Base Definitions, which talk about
things like what a file is, how regular expressions work, etc), XSH
(System Interfaces, the C API that defines POSIX’s internals), and XCU
(which defines the shell command language, and the standard utilities
available for the system). There’s also XRAT, which explains the
rationale of the authors, but it’s less relevant for our purposes today.
XBD and XRAT are both interesting as context for XSH and XCU, but those
are the real meat of the specification. This article will focus on the
XCU section, in particular the utilities part of that section. If you’re
more interested in the XSH section, there’s an excellent summary page
by sortix’s Jonas Termansen that you can read here. ↫ im tosti The

<h2 id="the-mips-thinkpad-and-the-unreleased-commodore-hhc-4">The MIPS
‘ThinkPad’ and the unreleased Commodore HHC-4</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-27, from: OS News</p>
<p>Old Vintage Computing Research, by the incredibly knowledgeable
Cameron Kaiser, is one of the best resources on the web about genuinely
obscure retrocomputing, often diving quite deep in topics nobody else
covers – or even can cover, considering how rare some of the hardware
Kaiser covers is. I link to Old VCR all the time, and today I’ve got two
more great articles by Kaiser for you. First, we’ve got the more
well-known – relatively speaking – of the two devices covered today, and
that’s the MIPS ThinkPad, officially known as the IBM WorkPad z50. This
was a Windows CE 2.11 device powered by a NEC VR4120 MIPS processor,
running at 131 Mhz, released in 1999. Astute readers might note the
WorkPad branding, which IBM also used for several rebranded Palm Pilots.
Kaiser goes into his usual great detail covering this device, with tons
of photos, and I couldn’t stop reading for a second. There’s so much
good information in here I have no clue what to highlight, but since
OSNews has OS in the name, this section makes sense to focus on: The
desktop shortcuts are pre-populated in ROM along with a whole bunch of
applications. The marquee set that came on H/PC Pro machines was
Microsoft Pocket Office (Pocket Word, Pocket Excel, Pocket Access and
Pocket PowerPoint), Pocket Outlook (Calendar, Contacts, Inbox and Tasks)
and Pocket Internet Explorer, but Microsoft also included Calculator,
InkWriter (not too useful on the z50 without a touch screen), Microsoft
Voice Recorder, World Clock, ActiveSync (a la Palm HotSync), PC Link
(direct connect, not networked), Remote Networking, Terminal (serial
port and modem), Windows Explorer and, of course, Solitaire. IBM
additionally licensed and included some of bSquare’s software suite,
including bFAX Pro for sending and receiving faxes with the softmodem,
bPRINT for printing and bUSEFUL Backup Plus for system backups, along
with a battery calibrator and a Rapid Access quick configuration tool.
There is also a CMD.EXE command shell, though it too is smaller and less
functional than its desktop counterpart. ↫ Old Vintage Computing
Research Using especially these older versions of Windows CE is a wild
experience, because you can clearly tell Microsoft was trying really
hard to make it look and feel like ‘normal’ Windows, but as anyone who
used Windows CE back then can attest, it was a rather poor imitation
with a ton of weird limitations and design decisions borne from the
limited hardware it was designed to run on. I absolutely adore the
various incarnations of Windows CE and associated graphical shells it
ran – especially the PocketPC days – but there’s no denying it always
felt quite clunky. Moving on, the second Old VCR article I’m covering
today is more difficult for me to write about, since I am too young to
have any experience with the 8 bit era – save for some experience with
the MSX platform as a wee child – so I have no affinity for machines
like the Commodore 64 and similar machines from that era. And, well,
this article just so happens to be covering something called the
Commodore HHC-4. Once upon a time (and that time was Winter CES 1983),
Commodore announced what was to be their one and only handheld computer,
the Commodore HHC-4. It was never released and never seen again, at
least not in that form. But it turns out that not only did the HHC-4
actually exist, it also wasn’t manufactured by Commodore — it was a
Toshiba. Like Superman had Clark Kent, the Commodore HHC-4 had a secret
identity too: the Toshiba Pasopia Mini IHC-8000, the very first portable
computer Toshiba ever made. And like Clark Kent was Superman with
glasses, compare the real device to the Commodore marketing photo and
you can see that it’s the very same machine modulo a plastic palette
swap. Of course there’s more to the story than that. ↫ Old Vintage
Computing Research Of course, Kaiser hunted down an IHC-8000, and
details his experiences with the little handheld, calculator-like
machine. It turns out it’s most likely using some unspecified in-house
Toshiba architecture, running at a few hundred kHz, and it’s apparently
quite sluggish. It never made it to market in Commodore livery, most
likely because of its abysmal performance. The amount of work required
to make this little machine more capable and competitive probably
couldn’t be recouped by its intended list price, Kaiser argues.</p>
