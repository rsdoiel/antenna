id="windows-recall-failed-the-moose-test-and-nobody-will-ever-forget-it">Windows
Recall failed the moose test, and nobody will ever forget it</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-22, from: OS News</p>
<p>Ars Technica took a look at how the current version of Windows Recall
works, including the improvements Microsoft made since the initial
security nightmare of a rollout, and concludes: Recall continues to
demand an extraordinary level of trust that Microsoft hasn’t earned.
However secure and private it is—and, again, the version people will
actually get is much better than the version that caused the original
controversy—it just feels creepy to open up the app and see confidential
work materials and pictures of your kid. You’re already trusting
Microsoft with those things any time you use your PC, but there’s
something viscerally unsettling about actually seeing evidence that your
computer is tracking you, even if you’re not doing anything you’re
worried about hiding, even if you’ve excluded certain apps or sites, and
even if you “know” that part of the reason why Recall requires a
Copilot+ PC is because it’s processing everything locally rather than on
a server somewhere. ↫ Andrew Cunningham at Ars Technica Way back in
1996, Mercedes-Benz unveiled the A-Class, a small, practical car that
purported to be more premium than cheaper, similarly-sized cars from
other brands. The car had a big problem, though – it was unusually
narrow and tall, and because of it, it famously failed spectacularly at
the “moose test”, in which a car has to suddenly swerve around a “moose”
on the road. The car simply toppled over, and after initially denying
the problem, Mercedes recalled every single A-Class sold and added a
variety of mitigations like electronic stability control and suspension
changes. As far as I can recall, it fixed the issue. To this day,
however, I cannot look at an A-Class, even the modern ones which look
like normal hatchbacks and bear effectively zero resemblance to the
original, quirky A-Class from 1996, and not think of the failed moose
test and the recall. I know the modern A-Class won’t fail that test, and
I know it’s an infinitely safer car than the original one, but my brain
still makes that connection every time I see one. A lot of people my
age, whether they’re into cars or not, seem to remember this recall,
because the original A-Class was such a unique and recognisable vehicle
at the time, especially coming from Mercedes. My point is – Recall will
face this same issue. No matter how secure Microsoft makes it, no matter
how much they claim and prove it only runs locally, no matter how hard
they try and hammer on the fact data never leaves your PC, people will
always think of that initial botched rollout, and all the accurate
reporting that Recall was a nightmare. And it just so happens that the
skepticism is warranted, and hopefully keeps people from using this
corporate Trojan horse.</p>

<h2 id="thanks-again-to-our-outgoing-sponsor-nova-custom">Thanks again
to our outgoing sponsor: Nova Custom</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-21, from: OS News</p>
<p>We’d like to thank our outgoing sponsor, Nova Custom, for sponsoring
OSNews! Nova Custom, based in The Netherlands, makes laptops focused on
privacy, customisation, and freedom. Nova Custom laptops ship with
either Linux, Windows, or no operating system, and they’re uniquely
certified for Qubes OS (the V54 model will be certified soon), the
ultra-secure and private operating system. On top of that, Nova Custom
laptops come with Dasharo coreboot firmware preinstalled, which is
completely open source, instead of a proprietary BIOS. Nova Custom can
also disable the Intel Management Engine for you, and you can opt for
Dasharo coreboot+Heads for the ultimate in boot security. Nova Custom
offers visual customisations, too, including engraving a logo or text of
your choice on the metal screen lid and/or palmrest and adding your own
boot logo. They also offer privacy customisations like removing the
microphone and webcam, installing a privacy screen, and more. A small
touch I personally appreciate: Nova Custom offers a long, long list of
keyboard layouts, as well as the option to customise the super key. Nova
Custom products enjoy 3 years of warranty, as well as updates and spare
parts for at least seven years after the launch of a product, which
includes everything from motherboard replacements down to sets of
screws. Nova Custom laptops can be configured with a wide variety of
Intel processor options, as well as a choice between integrated Intel
GPUs or Nvidia laptop GPUs. Thanks once again to Nova Custom for
sponsoring OSNews – for a little longer than anticipated due to our
weird RSS/captcha issues.</p>

<p>Only a few weeks ago, I linked to Cameron Kaiser’s excellent deep
dive into the DEC Professional 380 running PRO/VENIX, and now we have a
follow-up. Fortunately, today we have AI we have many more excellent and
comprehensive documents on the subject, and more importantly, we’ve
recently brought back up an oddball platform that doesn’t have
networking either: our DEC Professional 380 running the System V-based
PRO/VENIX V2.0, which you met a couple articles back. The DEC
Professionals are a notoriously incompatible member of the PDP-11 family
and, short of DECnet (DECNA) support in its unique Professional
Operating System, there’s officially no other way you can get one on a
network — let alone the modern Internet. Are we going to let that stop
us? ↫ Cameron Kaiser No. The answer is always no. If you’ve ever wanted
to know what’s involved in setting up a custom TCP/IP stack using serial
on a 40 year old UNIX workstation, your very specific desires are hereby
met.</p>

<h2 id="how-i-use-kate-editor">“How I use Kate Editor”</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-21, from: OS News</p>
<p>I love the Kate Text editor. I use it for pretty much all the
programming projects I do. Kate has been around for long time now, about
20 years! At least earliest blog post for it I could find was written in
2004. I wanted to go over my workflow with it, why I like it so much and
hopefully get more people to try it out. ↫ Akseli Lahtinen Programmers
and developers tend to be very set in their ways and have their
preferred workflows – which profession doesn’t, honestly – and since
there’s such a wide variety of developer and programming tools out
there, it feels like every single developer’s workflow and setup is
entirely unique. Akseli Lahtinen, KDE developer and allround awesome
person, details his setup using Kate, the venerable and feature-rich
text editor from the KDE project. As someone who can’t program, I can’t
really compare his workflow to my own, but what I found interesting
while reading his post is that there’s quite a bit of overlap between my
previous work as a translator and his work as a developer. While the
contents of each individual view inside his Kate window are obviously
different, the setup of windows and tools I had when translating looked
very similar. This shouldn’t be surprising to me – after all, both
translating and developing requires multiple work surfaces, language
plugins, formatting tools, tons of keyboard shortcuts, and a whole load
of browser tabs, PDF files, and other documents to find just the right
translation or the perfect term, as well as a ton of background to make
sure you understand the topic you’re translating about. Y’all have no
idea how much I know about the deepest complex inner-workings and
processes of some of the largest organisations in the world, just
because I needed to study them and had access to their internal
documentation and software. I also read and studied way too many complex
contracts, European law, and technical studies into medicine and
healthcare treatments, and I guess developers and programmers do the
same thing – just focusing on different subjects. What’s the best way to
do this thing in the programming language I’m using? How does this
library I want to integrate work? What are the API endpoints for this
service I want to use? It’s really not that different from translating,
and that never really dawned on me until now.</p>

confirms that higher-end NAS products will require its branded
drives</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-21, from: OS News</p>
<p>“Synology-branded drives will be needed for use in the newly
announced Plus series, with plans to update the Product Compatibility
List as additional drives can be thoroughly vetted in Synology systems,”
a Synology representative told Ars by email. “Extensive internal testing
has shown that drives that follow a rigorous validation process when
paired with Synology systems are at less risk of drive failure and
ongoing compatibility issues.” Without a Synology-branded or approved
drive in a device that requires it, NAS devices could fail to create
storage pools and lose volume-wide deduplication and lifespan analysis,
Synology’s German press release stated. Similar drive restrictions are
already in place for XS Plus and rack-mounted Synology models, though
work-arounds exist. ↫ Kevin Purdy at Ars Technica I’m honestly surprised
it’s taken Synology this long to start nickle-and-diming its users. I’m
sure the “Synology-branded” drives will carry substantial markups over
regular drives, despite the drives being otherwise identical. Charging
insane markups for expansion options is a tried-and-true way to increase
your margins, with Apple being the classic example of charging insane
prices for basic RAM or SSD upgrades. I think most of us here on OSNews
could easily build our own NAS, as it’s not a particularly complex
project. The various software options could be a bit more complicated to
navigate, but I don’t think it’s insurmountable for most of us. Normal,
average people, though, would most likely do best to just buy an
off-the-shelf NAS for their storage and local back-up needs, and it’s
those kind of people who Synology is aiming this policy at. They’ll be
easily fooled into thinking Synology-branded drives are somehow special,
and not just a generic drive with a fancy sticker. This is how the world
works, but that doesn’t make it any less unpleasant.</p>
