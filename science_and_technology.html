<h2 id="study-using-ai-slows-developers-down-significantly">Study: using
“AI” slows developers down significantly</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-11, from: OS News</p>
<p>It’s become almost impossible to avoid the “AI” evangelists spreading
the gospel of how “AI” tools are helping them work faster and get more
stuff done in less time, but do any of those claims have any basis in
reality? Should we really be firing countless people and replace them
with “AI” tools? Should we spend god knows how much money on “AI” tools
and force employees to use them? Well… When developers are allowed to
use AI tools, they take 19% longer to complete issues—a significant
slowdown that goes against developer beliefs and expert forecasts. This
gap between perception and reality is striking: developers expected AI
to speed them up by 24%, and even after experiencing the slowdown, they
still believed AI had sped them up by 20%. ↫ Joel Becker, Nate Rush,
Beth Barnes, and David Rein We’re very much in the early days of proper
research into the actual effectiveness and real-world benefits of “AI”
tools for all kinds of professions, so a study like this definitely
isn’t a smoking gun, but it does fly in the face of the tech companies
and their evangelists shoving “AI” down our collective throat. With how
much these tools get even the most basic stuff wrong, with how often
they lie and make stuff up, I just can’t imagine them speeding up as
many tasks as people claim they do. At the same time, “AI” tools do
definitely have a place for very specific tasks, and I think that
studies like these will look different for every single profession and
even every single task within a profession. It’s going to be incredibly
hard or even impossible to come to a “theory of everything” on the
effectiveness and usefulness of “AI” tools. It won’t be until this
idiotic hype dies down before we can have a grounded, honest, fact-based
discussion about which “AI” tools make sense where.</p>

<p>date: 2025-07-11, from: NASA breaking news</p>
<p>Sixty years ago, NASA’s Mariner 4 captured groundbreaking views of
the Red Planet, leading to a steady stream of advances in the cameras
used to study other worlds. In 1965, NASA’s Mariner 4 mission brought
Mars into American living rooms, where TV sets showed fuzzy
black-and-white images of a cratered landscape. The spacecraft took 21

<h2 id="the-eu-would-be-better-off-without-american-tech-companies">The
EU would be better off without American tech companies</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-11, from: OS News</p>
<p>James Heppell, representing Open Web Advocacy, published an article
detailing his experience attending DMA compliance workshop in Brussels,
in which members of the public can ask questions of companies who have
products designated as gatekeepers under the DMA. After attending the
Apple one, he concludes: As a final thought, I called this article
“Apple Vs The Law” primarily in reference to the rule of law, about how
it should be applied equally and fairly against all, no matter the size
and influence of your company. I think some of these gatekeepers – above
all Apple, do a lot to undermine this process, in some places genuinely
damaging trust in democracy. Going out of their way to paint the DMA law
and the EU as overstepping and extreme hurts its reputation, as does the
invented rhetoric about it being the “great risk to privacy ever imposed
to government” (China?), or that they’re “acting without experts in the
field”. Similarly for the number of covertly funded and supported
lobbying groups that they bring to regulators all around the world. And
the constant pressure from the US administration to not enforce the DMA
– helped in no small part by these gatekeepers. These money-driven
practices – which in many ways mirror the propaganda typically produced
by authoritarian regimes like Russia, seriously hurt all democracies
that they come in to touch with, and is a kind of behaviour that should
make Apple, and any other group involved, ashamed of themselves. ↫ James
Heppell Sometimes I wonder if us Europeans wouldn’t simply be better off
without these lying, scheming, law-breaking American technology
companies. Yes, there’s be a bit of a shock and a chaotic scrambling as
newcomers fill the void, but I think I’d prefer that over the illegal
behaviours that are clearly endemic in US technology companies. As a EU
citizen, I’m not even afforded 0.01% of the kind of silk glove, patient,
and cooing treatment these corporations get when they break the law, and
it highlights once more just how tiered justice really is. I think the
EU would, in the long term, be better off without the likes of Apple,
Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Facebook routinely and repeatedly
breaking our laws. Rip that festering, rotting band-aid off and endure
the chaos for a few years while European newcomers fill the void in a
beautiful explosion of competition and innovation. Do we really want to
be tied to these corporations that clearly despise us?</p>

<h2 id="thread-the-tech-we-cant-use-or-teach">Thread: the tech we can’t
use or teach</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>There’s quite a few ways to mess around with home automation, with
the most popular communication methods being things like ZigBee, plain
Wi-Fi, and so on. One of the more promising new technologies is Thread,
and Dennis Schubert decided to try and use it for a new homebrew project
he was working on. After diving into the legalese of the matter, though,
he discovered that Thread is a complete non-starter due to excessive
mandatory membership fees without any exceptions for non-commercial use.
To summarize: if you’re a hobbyist without access to some serious
throwaway money to join the Thread Group, there is no way to use Thread
legally – the license does not include an exception for non-commercial
uses. If you’re like me and want to write a series of blog posts about
how Thread works, there’s also no legal way. A commercial membership
program for technology stacks like Thread isn’t new; it’s somewhat
common in that space. Same with requiring certifications for your
commercial products if you want to use a logo like the “Works with
Thread” banner. And that’s fine with me. If you’re selling a commercial
electronics product, you have to go through many certification processes
anyway, so that seems fair. But having a blanket ban on implementations,
even for non-commercial projects, is absolutely bonkers. This means that
no hobbyist should ever get close to it, and that means that the next
generation of electrical engineers and decision-makers don’t get to play
around with the tech before they enter the industry. But of course, that
doesn’t really matter to the Thread Group: their members list includes
companies like Apple, Google, Amazon, Nordic, NXP, and Qualcomm – they
can just force Thread into being successful by making sure it’s shipped
in the most popular “home hubs”. So it’s just us that get screwed over.
Anyway, if you planned to look at Thread… well, don’t. You’re not
allowed to use it. ↫ Dennis Schubert So you can buy Thread dev kits to
create your own devices at home, but even such non-commercial use is not
allowed. The situation would be even more complex for anyone trying to
sell a small batch of fun devices using Thread, because they’d first
have to fork over the exorbitant yearly membership fee. What this means
is that Thread is a complete non-starter for anyone but an established
name, which is probably exactly why the big names are pushing it so
hard. They want to control our home automation just as much as
everything else, and it seems like Thread is their foot in the door. Be
advised.</p>

Android gets a rolling release canary channel</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>To better support you and provide earlier, more consistent access to
in-development features, we are announcing a significant evolution in
our pre-release program. Moving forward, the Android platform will have
a Canary release channel, which will replace the previous developer
preview program. This Canary release channel will function alongside the
existing beta program. This change is designed to provide a more
streamlined and continuous opportunity for you to try out new platform
capabilities and provide feedback throughout the entire year, not just
in the early months of a new release cycle. ↫ Dan Galpin on the Android
Developers Blog This new Canary channel is intended for developers, and
you can expect a ton of bugs and breaking changes. Updates are basically
streamed continuously over the air, but not all changes will make it to
a final release of Android (as in, they can be pulled definitively). You
can join the new channel with any supported Pixel device, but going back
to a beta or final release will require a full wipe.</p>

has been a complete, utter, unmitigated success</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>The year is 2013 and I am hopping mad. systemd is replacing my
plaintext logs with a binary format and pumping steroids into init and
it is laughing at me. The unix philosophy cries out: is this the end of
Linux (or, as many are calling it, GNU plus Linux)? The year is 2025 and
I’m here to repent. Not only is systemd a worthy successor to
traditional init, but I think that it deserves a defense for what it’s
done for the landscape – especially given the hostile reception it
initially received (and somehow continues to receive? for some reason?).
No software is perfect – except for TempleOS – but I think that systemd
has largely been a success story and proven many dire forecasts wrong
(including my own). I was wrong! ↫ Tyler Langlois The article goes into
detail on a number of awesome features, niceties, and clever things
systemd has, and they’re legion. Even as a mere user, I like systemd, as
every time I have had to or wanted to interact with it, it’s been a joy
to use, with excellent documentation making it remarkably easy even for
someone like me to get into it without doing any damage or breaking
anything. Every time I read up on system’d more advanced features, I’m
surprised by how well thought out and implemented it all seems to be.
I’ve experienced several major leaps forward in the Linux world that
made using Linux on my computers easier and more reliable, and the
adoption of systemd stands among them as one of the biggest leaps
forward desktop Linux has ever made. The idea of going back to a random
piles of non-standardized init scripts with nebulous dependencies from
varying sources and wildly different levels of quality seems like a
complete nightmare to me. There’s a lot of charm in doing things ‘the
old way’, and I’m not saying you’re wrong for wanting an init system
that tries to do less, or that’s easier to read and parse for you, or
whatever, but that doesn’t mean systemd is bad, evil, or part of a Red
Hat conspiracy to kill Linux.</p>

id="introducing-skia-graphite-chromes-rasterization-backend-for-the-future">Introducing
Skia Graphite: Chrome’s rasterization backend for the future</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>In Chrome, Skia is used to render paint commands from Blink and the
browser UI into pixels on your screen, a process called rasterization.
Skia has powered Chrome Graphics since the very beginning. Skia
eventually ran into performance issues as the web evolved and became
more complex, which led Chrome and Skia to invest in a GPU accelerated
rasterization backend called Ganesh. Over the years, Ganesh matured into
a solid highly performant rasterization backend and GPU rasterization
launched on all platforms in Chrome on top of GL (via ANGLE on Windows
D3D9/11). However, Ganesh always had a GL-centric design with too many
specialized code paths and the team was hitting a wall when trying to
implement optimizations that took advantage of modern graphics APIs in a
principled manner. This set the stage for the team to rethink GPU
rasterization from the ground up in the form of a new rasterization
backend, Graphite. Graphite was developed from the start to be
principled by having fewer and more comprehensible code paths. This
forward looking design helps take advantage of modern graphics APIs like
Metal, Vulkan and D3D12 and paradigms like compute based path
rasterization, and is multithreaded by default. ↫ Michael Ludwig and
Sunny Sachanandani at the Chromium Blog The level of complexity in
browsers and their rendering engines blows my mind every time I read
about it. When I first got access to the internet, it consisted of
static pages with text and still images, but now browser engines are
almost as complex as entire operating systems. Not all of that progress
has been good – boy has a lot of it not been good – but we’re stuck with
it now, and thus people making browsers have to deal with stuff like
this. If you ever wonder why there really only are two browser engines
in the world – Google’s Blink and Apple’s WebKit – this is your answer.
Who in their right mind wants to develop something like this from
scratch and compete with Google and Apple?</p>

id="ibm-launches-power11-vague-rumblings-about-new-raptor-workstations-while-ibm-continues-to-not-care-about-power-workstations">IBM
launches Power11, vague rumblings about new Raptor workstations while
IBM continues to not care about Power workstations</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>Ah, Power. The architecture that has so much going for it, but
despite concerted efforts from very dedicated people, IBM seems to be
hellbent on preventing anyone from expanding Power beyond expensive
enterprise servers. We had Raptor Computing Systems achieving some niche
success with their POWER9 workstations – I have two, and reviewed one of
them – but that’s about it. When IBM moved to Power10, the new
processors required closed-source, proprietary firmware in a few areas
of the design, which made them unsuitable for Raptor to develop a
successor to the Talos II and Blackbird POWER9 workstations. I admire
Raptor for sticking firmly to their convictions of only producing fully
open source hardware, down to the firmware level. The requirement for
proprietary firmware was never addressed by IBM during the Power10
lifecycle, so Raptor obviously never jumped aboard the IBM Power10
train, and as far as I can tell, neither did anyone else. As such, the
only Power10 hardware we have comes from IBM, and the offering consist
entirely of enterprise servers, which are unsuitable and unaffordable
for home use, whether as server or workstation. Raptor did make a joint
announcement with Solid Silicon, with rumours suggesting Solid Silicon
was working on a Power10-based chip that didn’t require any proprietary
firmware, but that was late 2023, and it’s been silence ever since. But
Power10 is old news now, since IBM just officially launched Power11. IBM
made the date official: Power11 launches July 25, with the 32
AI-core Spyre Accelerator expected to follow in the fourth quarter.
IBM’s launch products will be the full-rack Power E1180 with up to up to
256 SMT-8 Power11 cores with 2MB L2 each and up to 128GB of shared L3
(8GB per core) with 64TB of DDR5 memory, the midrange 4U Power E1150
with up to 120 Power11 cores and 16TB of DDR5, the junior 4U Power S1124
with up to 60 Power11 cores and 8TB of DDR5, and the “low-end” 2U Power
S1122 with up to 60 Power11 cores and 4TB of DDR5. The processors come
in 16, 24 or 30-core versions; the E systems have four sockets (with up
to four nodes in the E1180) and the S systems have two. All four systems
can run AIX and Linux, and all systems except for the E1150 can run IBM
i. As is usual for IBM’s initial offerings, internally they look like
straight-up implementations of the Blueridge reference platform and
should be expected to scale accordingly. And if you have to ask how much
they are, well… ↫ Cameron Kaiser Sadly, there’s no word on whether or
not IBM’s Power11 processors still require proprietary firmware, so it’s
impossible to tell if they will show up in any possible Raptor
workstations. There’s also zero indication of anyone else joining the
fray, and IBM itself obviously isn’t going to focus on end-user
workstations because the world is bleak and joyless. That being said,
we’ve got some solid rumours from Cameron Kaiser, who is generally
well-informed on these topics. I have been advised by an anonymous
individual with knowledge of the situation that a new Raptor
announcement on products under development is scheduled for Q1 2026 …
which would be “six to twelve months after” as predicted. “Open
firmware” is specifically mentioned and absolutely planned. It’s worth
pointing out that both Raptor and SolidSilicon are now listed as
top-tier Platinum members for OpenPOWER parallel with IBM itself. That
implies SolidSilicon is still in the mix and IBM is still backing
OpenPOWER. They stressed this is not an official announcement, so you
take it for what it’s worth. ↫ Cameron Kaiser It’s something, but not
much. I would love to be able to upgrade the POWER9 machines in my
office to something newer, even if they perform quite well to this day.
I simply have a soft spot for Power, and I want the ISA to succeed
beyond enterprise servers. The architecture has what it takes to do so,
but IBM seems to have zero interest in making it happen, making life
quite hard for anyone else in the ecosystem trying their hardest. All
we’re asking for is a single or dual socket Power11 workstation in a
nice case, IBM. Just flip one of those servers 90°, disable the
enterprise stuff, and optionally ship it with AIX. It won’t bite. I
promise.</p>

<h2 id="two-weeks-of-wayback-first-alpha-release-in-a-few-weeks">Two
weeks of Wayback: first alpha release in a few weeks</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-08, from: OS News</p>
<p>Alpine Linux maintainer Ariadne Conill only started working on
Wayback a few weeks ago, but in a blog post today they dive into a few
more details about how much progress has already been achieved. To
refresh your memory, Wayback allows you to run a legacy X11-based
desktop environment on top of Wayland by running a stub Wayland
compositor in front of Xwayland, capable of serving as a full X server.
This way, the transition to Wayland and the removal of X.org from
popular distributions won’t mean you can’t run X11-based desktop
environments anymore. Within just a few weeks, the project has made
serious progress. There’s a lot still left to do before we can
confidently say that Wayback is ready for distributions to switch to.
This work is across the stack: Wayback still needs to expose surfaces
that Xwayland can use, Xwayland needs to implement a few new features
such as cursor warping and some X extensions inside Xwayland itself need
to be properly plumbed (such as Xinerama being able to make use of the
Wayland output layout data). Longer term goals aside, we are at most a
few weeks away from the first alpha-quality release of Wayback. The main
focus of this release is to get to a point where enough is working that
users with basic setups and requirements can be reasonably served by
Wayback in place of the X.org server, to allow for further testing. It’s
already to a point where I am daily driving it. ↫ Ariadne Conill Of
course, there’s still tons of bugs to figure out and missing
functionality to implement, but the fact that they’re just weeks away
from a first alpha release is honestly impressive. I really hope Wayback
picks up even more and gets adopted by other distributions as well,
since it’s such an elegant and future-proof solution to a very real
problem. It’s important that desktop environments that will not or
cannot transition to Wayland remain available to Linux users regardless
of their choice of Wayland or X11. When facing the slow sunsetting of a
windowing system, some people go off on deranged neofascist conspiracy
rants against the woke illuminati, while others sit down and develop
real forward-looking solutions. I’m glad virtually every Linux
distribution that matters trusts the latter over the former.</p>

<p>As of today, Stat Counter reports that Windows 11 now has 50.88% of
the Windows market, with Windows 10 dropping to 46.2%, giving it a
comfortable lead over its predecessor. Windows 11 has been on the market
since 2021 but had only amassed less than 10% of the market by 2022.
It’s been a slow but steady climb since then, growing from 18% to 28% in
2023, with similar growth to 36% in 2024. It’s this year where Windows
11 really started taking off, likely aided by the fact that Microsoft is
now pushing Windows 10’s end of support hard. ↫ Zac Bowden at Windows

<h2 id="microsoft-broke-windows-update-on-windows-7-again">Microsoft
broke Windows Update on Windows 7 (again)</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>The developers of Legacy Update, the tool that allows users of older
Windows versions to keep downloading updates from Microsoft, recently
discovered that users of the tool on Windows 7 were having issues. After
doing some debugging they figured out it was DNS it was an expired
Microsoft certificate. This certificate was set to expire on 1 July
2025, and when it did, nobody at Microsoft bothered to correct it until
a few days later. As you can see from &amp;lt;ExpiryDate&gt;, it
definitely stopped working because the expiry date lapsed. As seems to
happen too often in our industry, apparently nobody set a reminder to
make sure it would be updated in advance of the date. You might notice
that it has an &amp;lt;IssuedDate&gt; of 2017-12-01. That’s fairly
recent! After digging further, we learned that this already happened
once! On the 4th of that month, Bleeping Computer covered an error
Windows 7 users were receiving when checking for updates. That error
is 80248015 – pretty familiar, right? Microsoft allowed this file to
expire, not on the 1st but rather on the 4th (more specifically, 35
seconds before midnight in US Pacific time, or 8:00 PM UTC), and did not
manage to upload a new file until the 6th at 10:02 AM Pacific (6:02 PM
UTC). This left Microsoft Update broken for 3 days. ↫ Adam Demasi
Microsoft moved the expiry date up to 2033, thereby fixing the problem.
Legacy Update’s developer Adam Demasi expected that once 2033 comes
around, Legacy Update will probably have to add Widnows 7 to its proxy
server that it’s already using for older versions, as improvements in
TLS and ciphers will probably lock Windows 7 out of Windows Update
definitively. But hey, 2033 is decades away. Right?</p>

<h2 id="winuae-6.0.0-released">WinUAE 6.0.0 released</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>WinUAE has released version 6.0.0 of the Windows version of the UAE
Amiga emulator, packing a truly terrifying number of changes,
improvements, and fixes. Major update to custom chipset emulation.
Internally almost everything in main chipset emulation has been
rewritten. Fastest possible/JIT mode chipset timing/sync had major
changes which can cause side-effects. Bugs are very possible, especially
in very rarely used features. ↫ WinUAE website Going through the
changelog is dizzying, ranging from an almost complete rewrite of the
main chipset emulation for internal cycle accuracy, to running the
emulation of the Denise/Lisa chips in a separate thread for better
performance, to a ton of fixes and smaller updates.</p>

icons keep getting worse every time Apple touches them</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-06, from: OS News</p>
<p>With macOS 26, Apple has announced a dramatically new look to their
UI: Liquid Glass. Solid material icon elements give way to softer,
shinier, glassier icons. The rounded rectangle became slightly more
rounded, and Apple eliminated the ability for icon elements to extend
beyond the icon rectangle (as seen in the current icons for GarageBand,
Photo Booth, Dictionary, etc.). With this release being one of the most
dramatic visual overhauls of macOS’s design, I wanted to begin a
collection chronicling the evolution of the system icons over the years.
I’ve been rolling these out on social media over the past week and will
continue to add to and update this collection slowly over the summer.
Enjoy! ↫ BasicAppleGuy Every single one of these icons is getting
progressively worse with almost every design change. They go from
beautifully crafted, easily readable and supremely distinguishable icons
to generic, repetitive blobs of colour, void of any personality,
artistry, or usability considerations. Also, Apple’s new icon design
language makes the icons look fuzzy, like they’re not being rendered
properly. It’s very unnerving. The one exception is probably the generic
folder icon, which looks fine in all of its incarnations. Then there’s
the classic Platinum, pixelated version from Mac OS 9 and earlier,
which, together with icons from Windows and BeOS from the same time
period, are a whole different style that I don’t think most people would
accept anymore these days, but that I absolutely adore. Mostly I’m just
sad that the craft of making exquisite icons for operating systems is
dying, replaced by what almost look like “AI” generated blobs of
indeterminate meaning, that rely more on preexisting knowledge of the
operating system and its applications in question than on being
recognisable and decipherable by anyone. I truly hope Windows and the
various open source desktops don’t follow in Apple’s footsteps here.</p>

Xbox executive urges laid off employees to talk to Copilot for emotional
support</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-06, from: OS News</p>
<p>A couple of days ago, Microsoft announced 9,000 layoffs across its
global workforce, impacting its engineering, Xbox, sales, and management
teams. This move also affected various initiatives, resulting in
the cancellation of at least three Xbox games, job cuts across various
studios, and even the shuttering of one game studio, The Initiative. In
the wake of this dark day in the the tech industry, a tone-deaf
Microsoft executive urged laid off workers to turn to AI tools for
emotional support. ↫ Usama Jawad at Neowin These corporations are raking
in massive amounts of profit, they’re doing better than ever, the cup of
money runneth over, and yet, they keep laying off thousands and
thousands of people almost every few months. The incentives in
modern-day capitalism clearly aren’t working out for the vast majority
of people, and then to give that final kick when you’re already down,
some asshat manager tells you to “talk to” sparkly autocomplete for
emotional support. Fuck this guy.</p>
