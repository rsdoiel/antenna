id="tcf-cookie-consent-popups-violate-gdpr-osnews-wants-to-stop-using-cookie-popups-too-once-we-get-enough-patreons">“TCF”
cookie consent popups violate GDPR; OSNews wants to stop using cookie
popups too once we get enough Patreons</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-16, from: OS News</p>
<p>You may not have heard of the “Transparency &amp; Consent Framework”,
but you’ve most likely interacted with it, probably on a daily basis.
The TCF is used by 80% of the internet to obtain “consent” from users to
collect their data and share it among advertisers – you know, the cookie
popups. In a landmark EU ruling yesterday, the TCF has been declared to
violate the GDPR, making it illegal. For seven years, the tracking
industry has used the TCF as a legal cover for Real-Time Bidding (RTB),
the vast advertising auction system that operates behind the scenes on
websites and apps. RTB tracks what Internet users look at and where they
go in the real world. It then continuously broadcasts this data to a
host of companies, enabling them to keep dossiers on every Internet
user. Because there is no security in the RTB system it is impossible to
know what then happens to the data. As a result, it is also impossible
to provide the necessary information that must accompany a consent
request. ↫ Irish Council for Civil Liberties It’s no secret that cookie
consent popups do not actually comply with the GDPR, and that they are
not even necessary if you simply don’t do any cross-site sharing of
personal information. It seems that this ruling confirms this in a legal
sense, forcing the advertising industry to come up with a new, better
system. On top of that, every individual company that participated in
this scheme is now liable for fines and damages. Complaints coordinated
by Johnny Ryan, Director of Enforce at the Irish Council for Civil
Liberties, prompted the ruling. He said: Today’s court’s decision shows
that the consent system used by Google, Amazon, X, Microsoft, deceives
hundreds of millions of Europeans. The tech industry has sought to hide
its vast data breach behind sham consent popups. Tech companies turned
the GDPR into a daily nuisance rather than a shield for people. ↫ Irish
Council for Civil Liberties The problem here is not so much the clarity
of applicable laws and regulations, but the cost and effectiveness of
enforcement. If it takes years of expensive and complex legal
proceedings to bring a company that violates the GDPR to heel, is it
really an effective legal framework? Especially when you take into
account just how many companies, big and small, there are that violate
the GDPR? OSNews uses a cookie popup and displays advertising, something
we have to do to gain a little bit of extra income – but I’m not happy
about it. Our ads don’t provide us with much income, perhaps about
€150-200, but that’s still a decent enough chunk of our income pie that
we need it. I would greatly prefer we turn off these ads altogether, but
in order to be able to afford that, we’d need to up our Patreon income.
OSNews Patreons get an ad-free version of OSNews. That’s a long and slow
process, especially with the current economic uncertainty making people
reconsider their expenses. Disabling our ads altogether for everyone
once we’re fully reader-funded is still my end goal, but until the world
around us settles down a bit, that’s a little while off. If you want to
speed this process up – you can become an OSNews Patreon and enjoy an
ad-free OSNews today.</p>

celebrates ten year anniversary with Rust 1.87.0 release</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-16, from: OS News</p>
<p>I generally don’t pay attention to the releases of programming
languages unless they’re notable for some reason or another, and I think
this one qualifies. Rust is celebrating its ten year anniversary with a
brand new release, Rust 1.87.0. This release adds anonymous pipes to the
standard library, inline assembly can now jump to labeled blocks in Rust
code, and support for the i586 Windows target has been removed.
Considering Windows 7 was the last Windows version to support i586, I’d
say this is fair. You can update to the new version using the rustup
command, or wait until your operating system adds it to its repository
if you’re using a modern operating system.</p>

id="accessibility-on-linux-sucks-but-gnome-and-kde-are-making-progress">Accessibility
on Linux sucks, but GNOME and KDE are making progress</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>Accessibility in the software world is a problem in general, but it’s
an even bigger problem on open source desktops, as painfully highlighted
by this excellent article detailing the utterly broken state of
accessibility on Linux. Reading the article is soul-crushing as it
starts to dawn on you just how bad the situation really is for those
among us who require accessibility features, making it virtually
impossible for them to switch to Linux. This obviously has to change,
and it just so happens that both on the GTK/GNOME and KDE side, recent
work on accessibility has delivered some valuable results. Starting with
GTK and GNOME, the framework has recently merged the AccessKit backend
with GTK 4.18, which enables accessibility features when running GTK
applications on Windows and macOS. On Linux, GTK still defaults to
at-spi, but I’m sure this will change eventually too. Another major
improvement are the special keyboard shortcuts normally provided by the
screen reader Orca. Support for these was in the works for a while but
incomplete, but now this work has been completed, and the new shortcuts
ship as part of GNOME 48. Accessibility support for GNOME Web has been
greatly improved as well, and Elevado is a new tool that shows you what
applications expose on the a11y bus. There’s a ton additional, smaller
changes too. On the KDE side, a number of accessibility improvements
have been implemented as part of the project’s goal to improving input
handling. You can now use the numerical pad’s arrow keys to move the
mouse cursor, there’s a new 3-finger gesture to invoke the desktop zoom
accessibility feature, keyboard navigation in general has been improved
in a wide variety of places in KDE, and a whole bunch more improvements.
In addition, a number of financial grants have been given to developers
working on accessibility in KDE, such as a project to make file
management-related features – think open/save dialogs, Dolphin, and so
on – fully accessibly, and projects to make touchpad and screen gestures
fully customisable. Accessibility is never really “done” or “perfect”,
but there’s definitely an increasing awareness among the two major open
source desktops of just how important it is. A few confounding factors –
like the switch to Wayland or the complicated history of audio on Linux
– have actually hurt accessibility, and it’s only now that things are
starting to look up again. However, as anyone with reduced vision or
auditory problems can tell you, Linux and the open source desktop still
has a very long way to go.</p>

joins Google Pixel in making its own smartphone chip</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>Following rumors, Xiaomi today announced that it will launch its very
own chip for smartphones later this month. The “XRING 01” is a chip that
the company has apparently been working on for over 10 years now.
Details about the chip are scarce so far, but GizmoChina points to
recent leaks that suggest the chip is built on a 4nm process through
TSMC. The chip supposedly has a 1+3+4 layout and should lag just a bit
behind Snapdragon 8 Elite and Dimensity 9400 in terms of raw horsepower,
sounding familiar to Google’s work with Tensor chips. ↫ Ben Schoon at
9To5Google I like this. Having almost every Android device use
Qualcomm’s chips is not good for fostering competition, and weakens
Android OEMs’ bargaining position. If we have more successful SoC
makers, consumers will not only gain access to a wider variety of chips
that may better suit their needs, it will also force Qualcomm to lower
its prices, compete better, or both. Everybody wins. Well, except
Qualcomm, I guess.</p>

id="oracle-releases-first-enthusiast-solaris-release-in-three-years-promises-more-regular-updates">Oracle
releases first “enthusiast” Solaris release in three years, promises
more regular updates</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-14, from: OS News</p>
<p>You’d almost forget, but aside from the enterprise-focused variant of
Solaris for which Oracle sells support contracts, the company has also
nominally maintained and released a version of Solaris aimed at
non-production use and enthusiasts. This version, called Solaris CBE or
Common Build Environment, has always been free to download and use, but
since it was last updated all the way back in early 2022, you’d be
forgiven for having forgotten all about it. Today, though, Oracle has
finally released a new version of Solaris CBE, after three years of
silence. The Common Build Environment (CBE) release for Oracle Solaris
11.4 SRU 81 is now available via “pkg update” from the release
repository or by downloading the install images from the Oracle Solaris
Downloads page. As with the first Oracle Solaris 11.4 CBE, this is
licensed for free/open source developers and non-production personal
use, and this is not the final, supported version of the 11.4.81 SRU,
but the pre-release version on which the SRU was built. It contains all
of the new features and interfaces, but not all of the final rounds of
bug fixes, from the 11.4.81 SRU. The previous version was the CBE for
11.4.42, so there’s more than 3 years worth of changes between these two
releases. If you wanted to read about the changes in every intervening
SRU, you can find the monthly SRU release announcements for every SRU,
and the What’s New summaries for each quarterly feature release starting
with SRU 63, on the Oracle Solaris blog. Some FOSS version updates are
also listed in Oracle Solaris 11.4 Bundled Software Updates. You can
also find posts about some of the new features from the SRUs on Joerg
Moellenkamp’s blog and Marcel Hofstetter’s blog. ↫ Alan Coopersmith and
Jan Pechanec With three years of changes, updates, and fixes to talk
about, it’s no surprise there’s a lot of things this new release covers,
and credit to Oracle: the blog post announcing this new release is
incredibly detailed, lists a ton of the changes in great detail, and is
definitely required reading if you’re interested in trying this release
out for yourself. I’m definitely tempted, even if it’s Oracle. Solaris
11.4 SRU 81 CBE comes with much more recent versions of the free and
open source tools and frameworks you’ve come to expect, like updated
versions of GCC, LLVM/clang, tons of programming languages like Python,
Perl, and Rust, as well as updates to all the related toolchain
components. The CTF (Compact C Type Format) utilities (ctfconvert,
ctfdump, and ctfmerge), used to build Solaris itself and crucial for
tools like DTrace, have also been updated, and now reside in /usr/bin.
These updates are joined by a massive number of other, related low-level
changes. For desktop users, GNOME has been updated from the veritably
ancient GNOME 3.38 to GNOME 45 (current is 48.1), which is a big jump
for Solaris desktop users. Firefox and Thunderbird jump from 91 ESR to
128 ESR, which should deliver a much-improved browsing and email
experience. All of this graphical desktop use is powered by version 21.1
of the X server, Mesa 21.3.8, and version 470.182 of the NVIDIA driver.
Grub has been updated to version 2.12, and thanks to a new secure boot
shim, users no longer have to make any changes to secure boot settings,
as Solaris will always default to installing the secure boot image. This
is just a small selection of all the changes, and it seems Oracle is
planning on releasing these CBE versions more often from here on out, as
they say this release contains a ton of preparatory work for changes in
upcoming releases, “which should come more often than once every three
years going forward”. Do note that while Solaris CBE releases are free
for non-production use, they’re not open source.</p>

<h2 id="silicon-valley-developers-need-to-unionise">Silicon Valley
developers need to unionise</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-14, from: OS News</p>
<p>I don’t know anything about hiring processes in Silicon Valley, or
about hiring processes in general since I’ve always worked for myself
(and still do, running OSNews, relying on your generous Patreon and
Ko-Fi support), so when I ran into this horror story of applying for a
position at a Silicon Valley startup, I was horrified. Apparently it’s
not unheard of – it might even be common? – to ask applicants for a
coding position to develop a complex application, for free, without much
guidance beyond some vague, generic instructions? In this case, the
applicant, Jose Vargas, was applying for a position at Kagi, the search
startup with the, shall we say, somewhat evangelical fanbase. After
applying, he was asked to develop a complete e-mail client, either as a
TUI/CLI or a web application that can view and send emails, using a fake
or a real backend, which can display at least plaintext e-mails. None of
this was going to be paid labour, of course. Vargas started out by
sending in a detailed proposal of what he was planning to create, ending
with the obvious question what kind of response he’d get if he actually
implemented the detailed proposal. He got a generic response in return,
without an answer to that question, but he set out to work regardless.
In the end, it took him about a week to complete the project and send it
in. He eventually received a canned rejection notice in response, and
after asking for clarification the hiring manager told him they wanted
something “simpler and stronger”, so he didn’t make the cut. I’m not
interested in debating whether or not Vargas was suited for the
position, or if the unpaid work he sent in was any good. What I do want
to talk about, though, is the insane amount of unpaid labour applicants
are apparently asked to do in Silicon Valley, the utter lack of clear
and detailed instructions, and how the hiring manager didn’t answer the
question Vargas sent in alongside his detailed proposal. After all, the
hiring manager could’ve saved everyone a ton of time by letting Vargas
know upfront the proposal wasn’t what Kagi was looking for. Everything
about this feels completely asinine to me. As a (former) translator, I’m
no stranger to having to do some work to give a potential client an idea
of what my work looks like, but more than half a page of text to
translate was incredibly rare. Only on a few rare occasions did a
prospective client want me to translate more than that, and in those
cases it was always as paid labour, at the normal, regular rate. For
context, half a page of text is less than half an hour of work – a far
cry from a week’s worth of unpaid labour. I’ve read a ton of online
discourse about this particular story, and there’s no clear consensus on
whether or not Vargas’ feelings are justified. Personally, I find the
instructions given by Kagi overly broad and vague, the task of creating
an email client to be overly demanding, and the canned (“AI”?) responses
by the hiring manager insulting – after sending in such a detailed
proposal, it should’ve been easy for a halfway decent hiring manager to
realise Vargas might not be a good fit for the role, and tell him so
before he started doing any work. Kagi is fully within its right to
determine who is and is not a good fit for the company, and who they
hire is entirely up to them. If such stringent, demanding hiring
practices are par for the course in Silicon Valley, I also can’t really
fault them for toeing the industry line. The hiring manager’s behaviour
seems problematic, but everyone makes mistakes and nobody’s perfect. In
short, I’m not even really mad at Kagi specifically here. However, if
such hiring practices are indeed the norm, can I, as an outsider, just
state the obvious? What on earth are you people doing to each other over
there in Silicon Valley? Is this really how you want to treat potential
applicants, and how you, yourself, want to be treated? Imagine if a
someone applies to be a retail clerk at a local supermarket, and the
supermarket’s hiring manager asks the applicant to work an entire week
in the store, stocking shelves and helping shoppers, without paying the
person any wages, only to deny their application after the week of free
labour is over? You all realise how insane that sounds, right? Why not
look at a person’s previous work, hosted on GitHub or any of its
alternatives? Why not contact their previous employers and ask about
their performance there, as happens in so many other industries? Why,
instead of asking someone to craft an entire email client, don’t you
just give them a few interesting bugs to look at that won’t take an
entire week of work? Why not, you know, pay for their labour if you
demand a week’s worth of work? I’m so utterly baffled by all of this.
Y’all developers need a union.</p>

the $40 million USPS project to send email on paper</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-14, from: OS News</p>
<p>How do you get email to the folks without computers? What if the Post
Office printed out email, stamped it, dropped it in folks’ mailboxes
along with the rest of their mail, and saved the USPS once and for all?
And so in 1982 E-COM was born—and, inadvertently, helped coin the term
“e-mail.” ↫ Justin Duke The implementation of E-COM was awesome. You’d
enter the messages on your computer, send it to the post office using a
TTY or IBM 2780/3789 terminals, to Sperry Rand Univac 1108 computer
systems at one of 25 post offices. Postal staff would print the messages
and send them through the regular postal system to their recipients. The
USPS actually tried to get a legal monopoly on this concept, but the FCC
fought them in court and won out. E-COM wasn’t the breakout success the
USPS had hoped for, but it did catch on in one, unpleasant way: spam.
The official-looking E-COM enevelopes from the USPS were very attractive
to junk mail companies, and it was estimated that about six companies
made up 70% of the total E-COM volume of 15 million messages in its
second year of operation. The entire article is definitely recommended
reading, as it contains a ton more information about E-COM and some of
the other attempts by USPS to ride the coattails of the computer and
internet revolution, including the idea to give every US resident an
@.us e-mail address. Wild.</p>

blinks, extends Office support for Windows 10 by three years</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-13, from: OS News</p>
<p>At the start of this year, Microsoft announced that, alongside the
end of support for Windows 10, it would also end support for Office 365
(it’s called Microsoft 365 now but that makes no sense to me) on Windows
10 around the same time. The various Office applications would continue
to work on Windows 10, of course, but would no longer receive bug fixes,
security plugs, and so on. Well, it seems Microsoft experienced some
pushback on this one, because it just extended this end-of-support
deadline for Office 365 on Windows 10 by an additional three years. To
help maintain security while you transition to Windows 11, Microsoft
will continue providing security updates for Microsoft 365 Apps on
Windows 10 for three years after Windows 10 reaches end of support.
These updates will be delivered through the standard update channels,
ending on October 10, 2028. ↫ Microsoft support article The reality is
that the vast majority of Windows users are still using Windows 10, and
despite countless shady shenanigans and promises of “AI” bliss, there’s
relatively little movement in the breakdown between Windows 10 and
Windows 11 users. As such, the idea that Microsoft would just stop
fixing security issues and bugs in Office on Windows 10 a few months
from now seemed preposterous from the outset, and that seems to have
penetrated the walls of Microsoft’s executives, too. The real question
now is: will Microsoft extend the same courtesy to Windows 10 itself?
The clock is ticking, there’s only a few months left to go before
support for Windows 10 ends, leaving 60-70% of Windows users without
security fixes and updates. If they blinked with Office, why wouldn’t
they blink with Windows 10, too? Who dares to place a bet?</p>

to someone who’s also using the Messages app, and that message happens
to include the name “Dave and Buster’s”, the message will never be
received. ↫ Guilherme Rambo As I read this first description of the bug,
I had no idea what could possibly be causing this. However, once Rambo
explained that every audio message is transcribed by Apple into a text
version, I immediately assumed what was going on: that “and” is throwing
up problems because the actual name of the brand is stylised with an
ampersand, isn’t it? It’s always DNS HTML, isn’t it? Yes. Yes it is.
MessagesBlastDoorService uses MBDXMLParserContext (via
MBDHTMLToSuperParserContext) to parse XHTML for the audio message.
Ampersands have special meaning in XML/HTML and must be escaped, so the
correct way to represent the transcription in HTML would have been “Dave
&amp;amp;amp; Buster’s”. Apple’s transcription system is not doing that,
causing the parser to attempt to detect a special code after the
ampersand, and since there’s no valid special code nor semicolon
terminating what it thinks is an HTML entity, it detects an error and
stops parsing the content. ↫ Guilherme Rambo It must be somewhat of a
relief to programmers and developers the world over that even a company
as large and filled with talented people as Apple can run into bugs like
this.</p>

removes support for the 486, and now I’m curious what that means for
Vortex86 processors</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-12, from: OS News</p>
<p>I had to dig through our extensive archive – OSNews was founded in
1997, after all – to see if we reported on it at the time, but it turns
out we didn’t: in 2006, Intel announced that in 2007, it would cease
production of a range of old chips, including the 386 and 486. In
Product Change Notification 106013-01, Intel proclaimed these chips
dead. Intel Corporation has been manufacturing its MCS 51, MCS 251 and
MCS 96 Microcontroller Product Lines for over 25 years now, and the
Intel 186 Processor Families, the Intel 386 Processor Families and the
Intel 486 Processor Families for over 15 years now. Additionally, we
have been manufacturing the i960 32 Bit RISC Processor Families for over
15 years. However, at this time, the forecasted volumes for these
product lines are now too low to continue production of these products
beyond the year 2007. Therefore, Intel will cease manufacturing silicon
wafers for our 6″ based processes in 2007. Affected products include
Intel’s MCS 51, MCS 251, MCS 96, 80X18X, 80X38X, 80X486DXX, the i960
Family of Microcomputers, in addition to the 82371SB, 82439TX and the
82439HX Chipsets. Intel has no choice but to issue a Product
Discontinuance Notice (PDN) effective 3/30/06. Last time orders will be
accepted till 3/30/07 with last time ship dates of 9/28/07. ↫ Intel
Product Change Notification 106013-01 Considering the 386, 486, and i960
families of processors were only used for niche embedded at very low
volumes at that point in time, it made sense to call it quits. We’re 18
years down the line now, and I don’t think anyone really mourns the end
of production for these processors. Windows ended support for these
chips well before the 2007 end of production date, with Windows 2000
being the last Windows version that would run on a 486, albeit only
barely, since it officially required a Pentium processor. Linux, though,
continued to support the 486, but that, too, is now coming to an end. In
a patch submitted to the LKML, Ingo Molnár, support for a variety of
“complicated hardware emulation facilities” for x86-32 will be removed,
effectively ending support for 486 and very early 586 processors, by
increasing the minimum kernel support features to include TSC and CX8
(CMPXCHG8B) hardware support. Linus Torvalds has expressed interest in
removing support for the 486 back in 2022, so this move doesn’t come as
a huge surprise. While most tech news outlets leave it at that, as I was
reading this news, I immediately thought of the Vortex86 line of
processors and what this would mean for Linux support for those
processors. In case you’re unaware, the Vortex86 is a line of
x86-32-compatible processors, originating at SiS, but now developed and
produced by DMP Electronics in Taiwain. The last two variants were the
Vortex86DX3, a dual-core chip running at 1Ghz, and the Vortex86EX2, a
chip with two asymmetrical cores that can run two operating systems at
once. Their platform support documents for Windows and Linux are from
2021, so we can’t rely on those for more information. Digging through
some of the documentation from ICOP, who sell industrial PCs based on
the latest Vortex86DX3, I think support in modern kernels is very much
hit and miss even before this news. All Vortex86 processors are
supposedly i586 (with later variants being i686, even), but some of the
earlier versions were compatible with the 486SX. On top of that, Linux
4.14 seems to be the last kernel that supports any of these chips
out-of-the-box based on the documentation by DMP – but then, if you go
back to ICOP, you’ll find news items about Linux 5.16 adding better
support for Vortex86, so I’m definitely confused. My uneducated guess is
that the DX3 and EX2 will probably work even after these changes to the
Linux kernel, but earlier models might have more problems. Even on the
LKML I can find messages from the kind of people who know their stuff
who don’t know all the ins and outs of these Vortex86 processors, and
which instructions they actually support. It won’t matter much for
people relying on Vortex86 processors in industrial and commercial
settings, though, since they tend to use custom stacks built by the
vendor, so they’re going to be just fine. What’s more interesting is the
what I assume is a small enthusiast market using Vortex86 processors who
might want to run modern Linux kernels on them. I have a feeling these
code removals might lead to some issues on especially the earlier
models, meaning you’ll have to use older kernels. I’ve always been
fascinated by the Vortex86 line of processors, and on numerous occasions
I’ve hovered over the buy button on some industrial PC using the
VortexDX3 (or earlier) processor. Let me know if you’re interested in
seeing what this chip can do, and if there’s enough interest, I can see
if I can set a Ko-Fi goal to buy one these and mess around with Windows
Embedded/CE, Linux, and god knows what else these things can be made to
run.</p>

<h2 id="a-brief-history-of-the-numeric-keypad">A brief history of the
numeric keypad</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-12, from: OS News</p>
<p>The title is a lie. This isn’t brief at all. Picture the keypad of a
telephone and calculator side by side. Can you see the subtle difference
between the two without resorting to your smartphone? Don’t worry if you
can’t recall the design. Most of us are so used to accepting the common
interfaces that we tend to overlook the calculator’s inverted key
sequence. A calculator has the 7–8–9 buttons at the top whereas a phone
uses the 1–2–3 format. Subtle, but puzzling since they serve the same
functional goal — input numbers. There’s no logical reason for the
inversion if a user operates the interface in the same way. Common sense
suggests the reason should be technological constraints. Maybe it’s due
to a patent battle between the inventors. Some people may theorize it’s
ergonomics. With no clear explanation, I knew history and the evolution
of these devices would provide the answer. Which device was invented
first? Which keypad influenced the other? Most importantly, who invented
the keypad in the first place? ↫ Francesco Bertelli and Manoel do Amara
Sometimes, you come across articles that are one-of-a-kind, and this is
one of them. Very few people would go to this length to document such a
particular thing most people find utterly insignificant, but luckily for
us, Francesco Bertelli and Manoel do Amara went all the way with this
one. If you want to know anything about the history of the numerical pad
and its possibly layouts, this is the place to go. What I’ve always
found fascinating about numerical pads is how effortless the brain can
switch between the two most common layouts without really batting an
eye. Both layouts seem so ingrained in my brain that it feels like
there’s barely any context-switching involved, and my fingers just
effortlessly flow to the correct numbers. Considering numbers tend to
confuse me, I wouldn’t have been at all surprised to find myself having
issues switching between the two layouts. What makes this even more
interesting is when I consider the number row on the keyboard – you
know, 1 through 0 – because there I do tend to have a lot of issues
finding the right numbers. I don’t mean it takes seconds or anything
like that, but I definitely experience more hiccups working with the
number row than with a numerical keypad of either layout.</p>

In this article, I have written a survey of the work that I and others
have done to improve the BSD file systems. Much of this research has
been incorporated into other file systems. ↫ Marshall Kirk McKusic
Variants of UFS are still the default file system in at least NetBSD and
OpenBSD, and it’s one of the two default options in FreeBSD (alongside
ZFS). In other words, this article, and the work described therein, is
still relevant to this very day.</p>
