<h2 id="ai-is-the-endgame-for-totalitarians">“AI” is the endgame for
totalitarians</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>We removed ads from OSNews. Donate to our fundraiser to ensure our
future! An internal Meta Platforms document detailing policies on
chatbot behavior has permitted the company’s artificial
intelligence creations to “engage a child in conversations that are
romantic or sensual,” generate false medical information and help users
argue that Black people are “dumber than white people.” These and other
findings emerge from a Reuters review of the Meta document, which
discusses the standards that guide its generative AI assistant, Meta AI,
and chatbots available on Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, the
company’s social-media platforms. ↫ Jeff Horwitz at Reuters The only way
one can describe the examples of allowed behaviour towards minors is
absolutely fucked up. If I’d find any person talking to my kids like
Facebook and Zuckerberg apparently think it’s okay to talk to children,
I’d be calling the police to file a report. I know I shouldn’t be
surprised considering it’s Facebook and Zuckerberg, a company with a
history of knowingly inciting violence and genocide and a founder who
created his website to creep on women, but the lows to which this
company and its founder are willing to go are just so unimaginable to
even people with just a modicum of morality, I just can’t wrap my brain
around it. The treatment of people of colour isn’t any better. Facebook
will happily argue for you that black people are dumber than white
people without so much as batting an eye. Again, none of this should be
surprising considering it’s Facebook, but add to it the fact that “AI”
is the endgame for totalitarians, and it all makes even more sense.
These tools are explicitly designed to generate totalitarian propaganda,
because they’re trained on totalitarian propaganda, i.e., most of the
internet. The examples of “AI” being fascist and racist are legion, and
considering the people creating them – Zuckerberg, Altman, Musk, and so
on – all have clear fascist and totalitarian tendencies or simply are
overtly fascist, we, again, shouldn’t be surprised. Totalitarians hate
artists and intellectuals, because artists and intellectuals are the
ones who tend to not fall for their bullshit. That’s why one of the
first steps taken by any totalitarian regime is curtailing the arts and
sciences, from Pol Pot to Mao, from Trump to Orban. Promoting “AI” as a
replacement for exactly these groups in society – “AI” generating “art”
to replace artists, “AI” doing “research” to replace actual scientists –
fits within the totalitarian playbook like a perfectly fitted glove.
When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time. This
apparently also applies to “AI”.</p>

hardware desktop 3D printing is dead – you just don’t know it yet</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>We removed ads from OSNews. Donate to our fundraiser to ensure our
future! Hi, FAB 2025 is still happening in Prague and it has been a
wonderful event. It’s been great to meet so many people from our
community at home, in Czechia! But during my chats with the attendee’s,
there was one topic which was emerging time and time again, and that is
the state of open hardware. I cannot talk about all of the open
hardware, but I can share experience from 3D printing. And it is not
good! Open hardware in 3D printing is dead – you just don’t know it yet.
This is an opinion piece, imagine we are talking about this topic over a
cold Pilsner… ↫ Josef Prusa What happens when the Chinese government
lists 3D printing as an industry it wants to dominate? Well, an
explosion in bogus patents and the death of tons of smaller, local
brands, leaving only major players from China and perhaps one or two
bigger non-Chinese brands. That’s the conclusion by Josef Prusa, founder
of Prusa Research, a major 3D printer maker from Prague, Czechia.
Prusa’s printers used to be entirely open source, but starting in 2023,
this is no longer the case – ostensibly because being open source
hardware meant that competitors were copying their work wholesale
without contributing anything back, or worse, stealing their work
entirely and keeping it all closed, despite the copyleft license in use.
Looking at the numbers, it seems clear that smaller companies will not
be able to deal with the onslaught of bogus patents, as fighting patent
infringement claims in court and getting patents invalidated, even if
prior art exists in abundance, is prohibitively expensive and incredibly
time-consuming. It’s a game of really expensive whack-a-mole against
people with far deeper pockets than you. Still, this whole thing does
taste a bit sour considering Prusa’s abandonment of its open source
roots and ideals. There’s a business to be run here, I understand that,
but principles do matter, and if not even a company priding itself on
producing open source hardware stands by its ideals, why should anyone
else?</p>

a rather short month, it being the middle of Summer and all, but there’s
still some significant stuff in here. For instance, a whole slew of
fixes arrived for su and other multiuser commands, mostly for the
benefit of SSH sessions. A central theme in July seems to have been
filesystems, as FAT16 was added to the known filesystem types in the
Storage Kit, quite a few fixes were implemented for NFSv4, and a number
of filesystems saw bugfixes to fix issues in rsync, and much more.
Another central theme is apparently a port of DOSEMU, for which a number
of bugfixes, changes, and improvements were implemented that could, in
turn, also benefit other possible ports. And of course, there’s much,
much more that happened, for which you’ll have to dive into the full
progress report.</p>

the Chromium engine running on a Linux host talking to a 68K Amiga
application running inside a 68K emulator</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-14, from: OS News</p>
<p>We removed ads from OSNews. Donate to our fundraiser to ensure our
future! Covering the Amiga world is always a bit of a crapshoot, since
for what is surely an incredibly small segment of the computing world,
it happens to be incredibly complex, with multiple competing Amiga-ish
operating systems and hardware platforms, all worsened by many empty
promises and bitter animosity flying every which way. This makes it hard
for an outsider to get a firm grasp on what’s going on, but as always,
I’ll try my best. The news here is that AmiKit has released a new
browser for the classic 68k Amiga that can load modern websites. The
browser is called AmiBrowser. AmiBrowser is an HTML 5 capable web
browser built for 68K with Zune/MUI. Ituses ARM libraries to power the
native rendering of the web pages. ↫ AmiKit press release AmiBrowser is
exclusive to AmiKit’s own Amiga-like hardware, the A600 GS and A1200 NG,
both of which are replacement boards for the original Amiga 600 and
1200, respectively. How do these machines work? Well, they come in the
shape of their original counterparts, but with far fewer chips, and one
crucial addition: a little Orange Pi Zero 3 (in the case of the A1200
NG, at least) daughterboard that contains the actual ARM SoC that powers
the machine. The way this setup works is that the Orange Pi Zero 3 boots
into a minimal Linux environment with a launcher-like interface, which
can in turn load up the Amiberry classic 68K Amiga emulator that can
communicate with its ARM Linux host. It’s inside this 68K emulator where
the actual operating system runs. This Amiga-like operating system is
called AmiBench, which is, very simply put, a modified variant of the
68K version of AROS, combined with libraries and components that can
make use of the ARM processor. And so we finally arrive at this new
browser. This new browser runs the Chromium Embedded Framework in the
host Linux environment on the ARM processor, forwarding its rendering
towards a native 68K Amiga/AROS application that’s running inside the
68K emulator. In between the CEF running on the Linux host and the
native Amiga 68K application running inside the emulator sits a glue
layer that takes care of the communication between the two sides. It’s
an interesting approach to a very difficult problem: how do you run a
modern browser on a hardware platform – 68K, in this case – that is
horribly outdated and far too slow to deal with modern websites? It’s an
interesting approach, but it also feels a little bit like a house of
cards. That being said, if the choice is between no access to the modern
web and shaky access to the modern web, I’d still choose the latter.</p>

GNU/Hurd 2025 released with Rust, 64bit support, and more</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-13, from: OS News</p>
<p>We removed ads from OSNews. Donate to our fundraiser to ensure our
future! The Hurd, the collection of services that run atop the GNU Mach
microkernel, has been in development for a very, very long time. The
Hurd is intended to serve as the kernel for the GNU Project, but with
the advent of Linux and its rapid rise in popularity, it’s the Linux
kernel that became the defacto kernel for the GNU Project, a combination
we’re supposed to refer to as GNU/Linux. Unless you run Alpine, of
course. Or you run any other modern Linux distribution, which probably
contains more non-GNU code than it does GNU code, but I digress. The
Hurd is still in development, however, and one of the more common ways
to use The Hurd is by installing Debian GNU/Hurd, which combines the
Debian package repositories with The Hurd. Debian GNU/Hurd 2025 was
released yesterday, and brings quite a few large improvements and
additions. This is a snapshot of Debian “sid” at the time of the stable
Debian “Trixie” release (August 2025), so it is mostly based on the same
sources. It is not an official Debian release, but it is an official
Debian GNU/Hurd port release. ↫ Samuel Thibault About 72% of the Debian
archive is available for Debian GNU/Hurd, for both i386 and amd64. This
indeed means 64bit support is now available, which makes use of the
userland disk drivers from NetBSD. Support for USB disks and CD-ROM was
added, and the console now uses xkb for keyboard layout support.
Bigger-ticket items are working SMP support and a port of the Rust
programming language. Of course, there’s a ton more changes, fixes,
improvements, and additions as well. You can either install Debian
GNU/Hurd using the Debian installer, or download a pre-installed disk
image for use with, say, qemu.</p>

goes ad-free, for everyone, and we need your support</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-12, from: OS News</p>
<p>Earlier today, I made the decision to remove all advertising from
OSNews. From here on out, you will no longer see any ads, cookie
banners, and other ad-related privacy-invasive technologies on this
website. While this means a hit to my income, making OSNews even more
reliant on our Patreon supporters and Ko-Fi donors, it genuinely feels
liberating. I should’ve made this decision years ago. Read on for how
you can support us, and our big fundraiser. I have always been open and
honest about my dislike for the modern online advertising industry. It’s
incredibly privacy-invasive, a massive security risk, generally lacking
in taste, and genuinely intrusive. As such, despite running ads on
OSNews, I have always advocated for the concept of “your computer, your
rules”, meaning only you, the user, gets to decide what gets run on your
computer and displayed on your screen. This includes the use of
ad-blockers. I have a Pi-Hole, and you can pry it from my cold, dead
hands. Because of this, maintaining ads on OSNews became untenable.
Everything about the ads on our site, from the actual ads themselves to
the annoying cookie banners talking about “our 1500 partners”, gave me
the ick, as the young, hip people say, and I’ve been considering turning
them off for a long time. Today, after yet another reader rightfully
pointing out how absurd our cookie banner was, I finally made the call.
One email to our owner, David Adams, later, and we’re now entirely
ad-free, for everyone. This is a hit to my income, and as such, I kindly
ask anyone capable of doing so to support the continued existence of
OSNews. How can you support OSNews? We’ve been online since 1997,
meaning soon we’ll be hitting our 30-year anniversary. Very few websites
can boast about such a long, uninterrupted existence, and despite all
the changes both the industry and the world at large have gone through,
OSNews is still here, doing what it has always done. The removal of ads
means we’re even more dependent on you, dear readers, but I’m confident
in saying that we’ll make it another 30 years. Thank you for all your
continued support over the decades, and let’s keep going. Without icky
ads.</p>

Liquid Glass effects “Only Apple” can make</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-12, from: OS News</p>
<p>Apple, back in June of this year: This is our broadest software
design update ever. Meticulously crafted by rethinking the fundamental
elements that make up our software, the new design features an entirely
new material called Liquid Glass. It combines the optical qualities of
glass with a fluidity only Apple can achieve, as it transforms depending
on your content or context. ↫ Apple’s WWDC press release Today,
iGerman00, detailing their merge request for adding Liquid Glass effects
to a KWin plugin: Added a Concave (lens) refraction mode for a more
“Liquid Glass” look, it’s a lot closer than the current implementation.
Also added a Refraction Corner Radius slider (0–200px, 30 steps) to
shape the SDF independently of edge size. Because the concave
implementation is a bit “weaker”, I’ve raised the maxima to 30 for the
relevant sliders. Added some UI logic for irrelevant options between
modes. ↫ iGerman00’s merge request One of the world’s wealthiest
companies, outdone by a random “amateur hobbyist developer“. Not only
does this merge request recreate Apple’s Liquid Glass effects, it does
so with a detailed settings panel to control every aspect of the effect,
something Apple obviously won’t allow you to do. “Only Apple” my
ass.</p>

new “AI” features cause CPU spikes and battery drain</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-12, from: OS News</p>
<p>Almost three weeks ago, Mozilla released Firefox 141 that, among
other features like memory optimizations for Linux and a built-in unit
converter, brought controversial AI-enhanced tab groups. Powered by a
local AI model, these groups identify related tabs and suggest names for
them. There is even a “Suggest more tabs for group” button that users
can click to get recommendations. Now, several users have taken to the
Firefox subreddit to complain about high CPU usage when using the
feature, as well as express their disappointment in Mozilla for adding
AI to the browser. ↫ David Uzondu at NeoWin Is anybody even asking for
“AI” features in Firefox? Of the six people still left using Firefox,
does even one of them want a chatbot in Firefox? Is any Firefox user the
type of user to use some nebulous “AI” tool to organize their open tabs?
Seeing these kinds of frivolities in Chrome or Edge or whatever makes
sense, but in Firefox? At least they’re easy to disable through
about:config – just set both browser.ml.chat.enabled and
browser.tabs.groups.smart.enabled to false. I mean, I guess I can
understand Mozilla trying to ride the hype bubble, but at least make
this nonsense opt-in, instead of asking users to dig around in obtuse
config flags.</p>

<h2 id="kde-improves-focus-stealing-prevention-on-wayland">KDE improves
focus stealing prevention on Wayland</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-11, from: OS News</p>
<p>You click a link in your chat app, your browser with a hundred tabs
comes to the front and opens that page. How hard can it be? Well, you
probably know by now that Wayland, unlike X, doesn’t let one application
force its idiot wishes on everyone else. In order for an application to
bring its window to the front, it needs to make use of the XDG
Activation protocol. In essence, an application cannot take focus, it
can only receive focus. In the example above, your chat app would
request an XDG Activation token from the compositor. It then asks the
system to open the given URL (typically launching the web browser) and
sends along the token. The browser can then use this token to activate
its window. ↫ Kai Uwe After explaining exactly how this mechanism works,
KDE developer Kai Uwe details the issue that not every application yet
properly supports the XDG Activation protocol, and some that do have
bugs that, say, might make an application discard its token too early.
In other words, it’s time to start testing. You’ll need to use the
latest git master brach of KWin, and enable set the “Focus Stealing
Prevention” option in Window Management to “Extreme”. When set to
“Extreme”, KWin will exclusively activate windows that request
activation with a valid token. They’ve already found and fixed a number
of issues in KDE using this method, but more are bound to found,
particularly in third-party applications. They’re planning on turning on
KWin’s focus stealing prevention on Wayland with forgiving settings at
first, but increase the strictness of the feature as time progresses and
issues are fixed.</p>

<h2 id="github-becomes-part-of-microsofts-ai-organisation">GitHub
becomes part of Microsoft’s “AI” organisation</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-11, from: OS News</p>
<p>It seems Microsoft is absorbing GitHub deeper into Microsoft.
GitHub’s CEO Thomas Dohmke is stepping down, and GitHub will be
integrated into a new department within Microsoft. Which department will
become the new stewards of GitHub, and the massive pile of open source
code it’s hosting? You already know. Still, after all this time, my
startup roots have begun tugging on me and I’ve decided to leave GitHub
to become a founder again. GitHub and its leadership team will continue
its mission as part of Microsoft’s CoreAI organization, with more
details shared soon. I’ll be staying through the end of 2025 to help
guide the transition and am leaving with a deep sense of pride in
everything we’ve built as a remote-first organization spread around the
world. ↫ Thomas Dohmke GitHub will become part of a new “AI” engineering
group inside Microsoft, led by a former Facebook executive, Jay Parikh.
As The Verge notes, this new group includes platform and development
tools and Dev Div teams, “with a focus on building an AI platform and
tools for both Microsoft and its customers”. In other words, Microsoft
is going to streamline taking your code and sucking it up into its “AI”
slop machines. If you’re hosting code on GitHub, the best time to move
it somewhere else was yesterday, but if you haven’t yet, the second best
time is today. Unless you want your code to be sucked up into Microsoft
and regurgitated to sloppify Windows and Office, you should be moving
your code to GitHub alternatives.</p>

is better than HDMI, and I will die on this hill</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-11, from: OS News</p>
<p>Over the years, we’ve seen a good number of interfaces used for
computer monitors, TVs, LCD panels and other all-things-display
purposes. We’ve lived through VGA and the large variety of analog
interfaces that preceded it, then DVI, HDMI, and at some point, we’ve
started getting devices with DisplayPort support. So you might think
it’s more of the same. However, I’d like to tell you that you probably
should pay more attention to DisplayPort – it’s an interface powerful in
a way that we haven’t seen before. ↫ Arya Voronova at HackADay
DisplayPort is a better user experience in every way compared to HDMI. I
am so, so sad that HDMI has won out in the consumer electronics space,
with all of its countless anti-user features as detailed in the linked
article. I refuse to use HDMI when DisplayPort is available, so all of
my computers’ displays are hooked up over DP. Whenever I did try to use
HDMI, I always ran into issues with resolution, refresh rates, improper
monitor detection, and go knows what else. Plug in a DP cable, and
everything always just works. Sadly, in consumer electronics,
DisplayPort isn’t all that common. Game consoles, Hi-Fi audio,
televisions, and so on, all push HDMI hard and often don’t offer a
DisplayPort option at all. It takes me back to the early-to-late 2000s,
when my entire audio setup was hooked up using optical cables, simply
because I was a MiniDisc user and had accepted the gospel of optical
cables. Back then, too, I refused to buy or use anything that used
unwieldy analog cables. Mind you, this had nothing to do with audio
quality – it was a usability thing. If anyone is aware of home audio
devices and televisions that do offer DisplayPort, feel free to jump
into the comments.</p>

<h2 id="zigs-lovely-syntax">Zig’s lovely syntax</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-11, from: OS News</p>
<p>It’s a bit of a silly post, because syntax is the least interesting d
detail about the language, but, still, I can’t stop thinking how Zig
gets this detail just right for the class of curly-braced languages,
and, well, now you’ll have to think about that too. On the first glance,
Zig looks almost exactly like Rust, because Zig borrows from Rust
liberally. And I think that Rust has great syntax, considering all the
semantics it needs to express (see “Rust’s Ugly Syntax”). But Zig
improves on that, mostly by leveraging simpler language semantics, but
also through some purely syntactical tasteful decisions. ↫ Alex Kladov
Y’all know full well I know very little about programming, so there’s
much interesting stuff I can add here. The only slightly related frame
of reference I have is how some languages – as in, the ones we speak –
have a pleasing grammar or spelling, and how even when you can’t
actually speak a language, some of them intrinsically look attractive
and pleasing when you see them in written form. I mean, you can’t look
at Scottisch Gaelic and not notice it just looks pleasing: Dh’ éirich mi
moch air mhaduinn an-dé‘S gun ghearr mi’n ear-thalmhainn do bhrìgh mo
sgéilAn dùil gu ’m faicinn fhéin rùn mo chléibhOch òin gu ’m faca ’s a
cùl rium féin. ↫ Mo Shùil Ad Dhèidh by Donald MacNicol I have no idea if
programmers can look at programming languages the same way, but I’ve
often been told there’s more overlap between programming languages and
regular language than many people think. As such, it wouldn’t surprise
me if some programming languages look really pleasing to programmers,
even if they can’t use them because they haven’t really learned them
yet.</p>
