my attempt to find out if you can do NFC tap-to-pay without big
tech</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-12, from: OS News</p>
<p>I’ve been dropping a lot of hints about my journey to rid myself of
Google’s Android on my Pixel 8 Pro lately, a quest which grew in scope
until it covered everything from moving to GrapheneOS to dropping Gmail,
from moving to open source “stock” Android application replacements to
reconsidering my use of Google Photos, from dropping my dependency on
Google Keep to setting up Home Assistant, and much, much more. You get
the idea: this has turned into a very complex process where I evaluated
my every remaining use of big tech, replacing them with alternatives
where possible, leaving only a few cases where I’m sticking with what I
was using. And yes, this whole process will turn into an article
detailing my quest, because I think recent events have made remocing big
tech from your life a lot more important than it already was. Anyway,
one of the few things I couldn’t find an alternative for was Google
Pay’s tap-to-pay functionality in stores. I don’t like using cash – I
haven’t held paper money in my hands in like 15 years – and I’d rather
keep my bank cards, credit card, and other important documents at home
instead of carrying them around and losing them (or worse). As such, I
had completely embraced the tap-to-pay lifestyle, with my phone and my
Pixel Watch II. Sadly, Google Pay tap-to-pay NFC payments are simply not
possible on GrapheneOS (or other de-Googled ROMS, for that matter),
because of Google’s stringent certification requirements. Some banks do
offer NFC payments through their own applications, but mine does not. I
thought this is where the story ended, but as it turns out, there is
actually a way to get tap-to-pay NFC payments in stores back: Garmin
Pay. Garmin offers this functionality on a number of its watches, and it
pretty much works wherever Google Pay or Apple Pay is accepted, too. And
best of all: it works just fine on de-Googled Android ROMs. Peope have
been asking me to check this out and make it part of my quest, and ever
the people-pleaser, I would love to oblige. Sadly, it does require
owning a supported Garmin watch, which I don’t have. To guage interest
in me testing this, I’ve set up a Ko-Fi goal of €400 you can contribute
to. Obviously, this is by no means a must, but if you’re interested in
finding out if you can ditch big tech, but keep enjoying the convenience
of tap-to-pay NFC payments – this is your chance.</p>

<h2 id="qemu-with-virtio-gpu-vulkan-support">QEMU with VirtIO GPU Vulkan
support</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-12, from: OS News</p>
<p>With its latest reales qemu added the Venus patches so that
virtio-gpu now support venus encapsulation for vulkan. This is one more
piece to the puzzle towards full Vulkan support. An outdated blog post
on clollabora described in 2021 how to enable 3D acceleration of Vulkan
applications in QEMU through the Venus experimental Vulkan driver for
VirtIO-GPU with a local development environment. Following up on the
outdated write up, this is how its done today. ↫ Pepper Gray A major
milestone, and for the adventurous, you can get it working today. Give
it a few more months, and many of the versions required will be part of
your ditribution’s package repositories, making the process a bit
easier. On a related note, Linux kernel developers are considering
removing 32-bit x86 KVM host support for all architectures that support
it – PowerPC, MIPS, RISC-V, and x86-64 – because nobody is using this
functionality. This support was dropped from 32bit ARM a few years ago,
and the remaining architectures mentioned above have orders of magnitude
fewer users still. If nobody is using this functionality, it really
makes no sense to keep it around, and as such, the calls to remove it.
In other words, if your custom workflow of opening your garage door
through your fridge light’s flicker frequency and the alignment of the
planets and custom scripts on a Raspberry Pi 2 requires this support,
let the kernel developers know, or forever hold your peace.</p>

<h2 id="turning-off-zen-4s-op-cache-for-curiosity-and-giggles">Turning
off Zen 4’s op cache for curiosity and giggles</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-12, from: OS News</p>
<p>CPUs start executing instructions by fetching those instruction bytes
from memory and decoding them into internal operations (micro-ops).
Getting data from memory and operating on it consumes power and incurs
latency. Micro-op caching is a popular technique to improve on both
fronts, and involves caching micro-ops that correspond to frequently
executed instructions. AMD’s recent CPUs have particularly large
micro-op caches, or op caches for short. Zen 4’s op cache can hold 6.75K
micro-ops, and has the highest capacity of any op cache across the past
few generations of CPUs. This huge op cache enjoys high hitrates, and
gives the feeling AMD is leaning harder on micro-op caching than Intel
or Arm. That begs the question of how the core would handle if its big,
beautiful op cache stepped out for lunch. ↫ Chester Lam at Chips and
Cheese The results of turning off the op cache were far less dramatic
than one would expect, and this mostly comes down to the processor
having to wait on other bottlenecks anyway, like the memory, and a lot
of tasks consisting of multiple types of operations which not all make
use of op cache. While it definitely contributes to making Zen 4 cores
faster overall, even without it, it’s still an amazing core that
outperforms its Intel competition. As a sidenote, this is such a fun and
weird thing to do and benchmark. It doesn’t serve much of a purpose, and
the information gained isn’t very practical, but turning off specific
parts of a processor and observing the consequences does create some
insight into exactly how a modern processor works. There are so many
different elements that make up a modern processor now, and just
gigahertz or even the number of cores barely tells even half the story.
Anyway, we need more of these weird benchmarks.</p>

<h2 id="a-twenty-five-year-old-curl-bug">A twenty-five year old curl
bug</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-12, from: OS News</p>
<p>When we announced the security flaw CVE-2024-11053 on December 11,
2024 together with the release of curl 8.11.1 we fixed a security bug
that was introduced in a curl release 9039 days ago. That is close to
twenty-five years. The previous record holder was CVE-2022-35252 at 8729
days. ↫ Daniel Stenberg Ir’s really quite fascinating to see details
like this about such a widepsread and widely used tool like curl. The
bug in question was a logic error, which made Stenberg detail how any
modern language like Rust, instead of C, would not have prevented this
issue. Still, about 40% of all security issues in curl stem from not
using a memory-safe language, or about 50% of all high/critical severity
ones. I understand that jumping on every bandwagon and rewriting
everything in a memory-safe language is a lot harder than it sounds, but
I also feel like it’s getting harder and harder to keep justifying using
old languages like C. I really don’t know why people get so incredibly
upset at the cold, hard data about this. Anyway, the issue that sparked
this post is fixed in curl 8.11.1.</p>

<h2 id="hp-rt-hps-real-time-operating-system-from-the-90s">HP-RT: HP’s
real-time operating system from the ’90s</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-11, from: OS News</p>
<p>Every now and then I load OpenPA and browse around. Its creator and
maintainer, Paul Weissmann, has been very active lately updating the
site with new articles, even more information, and tons of other things,
and it’s usually a joy to stumble upon something I haven’t read yet, or
just didn’t know anything about. This time it’s something called HP-RT,
a real-time operating system developed and sold by HP for a number of
its PA-RISC workstations back in the ’90s. HP-RT is derived from the
real-time operating system LynxOS and was built as real-time operating
system from scratch with native POSIX API and Unix features like
protected address spaces, multiprocessing, and standard GUI. Real-time
scheduling is part of the kernel with response times under 200 µs, later
improved to sub-100 µs for uses such as hospital system tied to a heart
monitor, or a missile tracking system. For programming, HP-RT supported
dynamic shared libraries, ANSI C, Softbench (5.2), FORTRAN, ADA, C++ and
PA-RISC assembly. From HP-RT 3.0, GUI-based debugging environment
(DDErt) and Event Logging library (ELOG) were included. POSIX 1003.1,
1003.1b and POSIX 1003.4a draft 4 were supported. On the software side,
HP-RT supported fast file system, X and Motif clients, X11 SERVERrt,
STREAMSrt (SVR 3.2), NFS, and others. ↫ Paul Weissmann at OpenPA I had
no idea HP-RT existed, and looking at the feature list, it seems like it
was actually a pretty impressive operating system and wider ecosystem
back in the ’90s when it was current. HP released several versions of
its real-time operating system, with 1997’s 3.0 and 3.01 being the final
version. Support for it ended in the early 2000s alongside the end of
the line for PA-RISC. I’d absolutely love to try it out today, but
sadly, my PA-RISC workstation – an HP Visualise c3750 – is way too “new”
to be supported by HP-RT, and in the wrong product category at that.
HP-RT required both a regular HP 9000 700 HP-UX workstation, as well as
one of HP’s VME machines with a single-module module with the specific
“rt” affix in the model number. On top of that you obviously needed the
actual HP-RT operating system, which was part of the HP-RT Development
Environment. The process entails using the HP-UX machine to compile
HP-RT, which was then downloaded to the VMe machine. The odds of not
only finding all the right parts to complete the setup, but also to get
it all working with what is undoubtedly going to be spotty documentation
and next to nobody to talk to about how to do it, are very, very slim.
I’m open to suggestions, of course, but considering the probable crazy
rarity of the specific hardware, the price-gauging going on in the
retrocomputing world, the difficulty of shipping to the Swedish Arctic,
and the knwoledge required, I don’t think I’ll be the one to get this to
work and show it off. But man do I want to.</p>

of emotional supports robots for kids abruptly shuts down, kills all the
robots in the process</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>Some news is both sad and dystopian at the same time, and this is one
of those cases. Moxie, a start-up selling $800 emotional support robots
intended to help children is shutting down operations since it can’t
find enough money, and since their robots require constant connectivity
to servers to operate, all of the children’s robots will cease
functioning within days. They’re not offering refunds, but they will
send out a letter to help parents tell their children “in an
age-appropriate way” that their lovable robot is going to die. If you
have kids yourself, you know how easily they can sometimes get attached
to the weirdest things, from fluffy stuffed animals designed to be cute,
to random inanimate objects us adults would never consider to be even
remotely interesting. I can definitely see how my own kids would be
devastated if one of their favourite “emotional” toys were to suddenly
stop working or disappear, and we don’t even have anything that pretends
to have a personality or that actively interacts with our kids like this
robot thing does. We can talk about how it’s insane that no refunds will
be given, or how a company can just remotely kill a product like this
without any repercussions, but most of all I’m just sad for the kids who
use one and are truly attached to it, who now have to deal with their
little friend going away. That’s just heartbreaking, and surely a sign
of things to come as more and more companies start stuffing “AI” into
their toys. The only thing I can say is that we as parents should think
long and hard about what kind of toys we give our children, and that we
should maybe try to avoid anything tied to a cloud service that can go
away at any time.</p>

<h2 id="a-brief-history-of-mac-servers">A brief history of
Mac servers</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>Although there’s little evidence of them today, Apple made a long
succession of Mac servers and servers for Macs from 1988 to 2014, and
only discontinued support for the last release of macOS Server in April
2022. Its first entry into the market was a special version of the
Macintosh II running Apple’s own port of Unix way back in 1988. ↫ Howard
Oakley These days, you can nab Xserves for pretty cheap on eBay, but
since Apple doesn’t properly support them anymore, they’re mostly a
curiosity for people who are into retro homelab stuff and the odd Apple
enthusiast who doesn’t know what to do with it. It always felt like
Apple’s head was never really in the game when it came to its servers,
despite the fact that both its hardware and software were quite
interesting and user friendly compared to the competition. Regardless,
if my wife and I ever manage to buy our own house, the basement’s
definitely getting a nice homelab rack with old – mostly non-x86 Sun and
HP – servers, and I think an Xserve would be a fun addition, too. Living
in the Arctic means any heat they generate is useful for like 9 or so
months of the year to help warm the house, and since our electricity is
generated from hydropower they wouldn’t be generating a massive excess
of pollution, either. I have to figure out what to do with the excess
heat during the few months of the year where it’s warm outside,
though.</p>

state-of-the-art quantum chip</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>Today I’m delighted to announce Willow, our latest quantum chip.
Willow has state-of-the-art performance across a number of metrics,
enabling two major achievements. The concensus seems to be that this is
a major achievement and milestone in quantum computing, and that it’s
come faster than everyone expected. This topic is obviously far more
complicated than most people can handle, so we have to rely on the
verdicts and opinions from independent experts to gain some sense of
just how significant an announcement this really is. The paper’s
published in Nature for those few of us possessing the right amount of
skill and knowledge to disseminate this information.</p>

id="the-state-of-falkon-kdes-browser-is-much-better-than-you-know">The
state of Falkon: KDE’s browser is much better than you know</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>It’s no secret that I am very worried about the future of Firefox,
and the future of Firefox on Linux in particular. I’m not going to
rehash these worries here, but suffice to say that with Mozilla
increasingly focusing on advertising, Firefox’ negligible market share,
and the increasing likeliness that the Google Search deal, which
accounts for 85% of Mozilla’s revenue, will come to an end, I have
little faith in Firefox for Linux remaining a priority for Mozilla. On
top of that, as more and more advertising nonsense, in collaboration
with Facebook, makes its way into Firefox, we may soon arrive at a point
where Firefox can’t be shipped by Linux distributions at all anymore,
due to licensing and/or idealogical reasons. I’ve been warning the Linux
community, and distributions in particular, for years now that they’re
going to need an alternative default browser once the inevitable day
Firefox truly shits the bed is upon us. Since I’m in the middle of
removing the last few remaining bits of big tech from my life, I figured
I might as well put my money where my mouth is and go on a small side
quest to change my browser, too. Since I use Fedora KDE on all my
machines and prefer to have as many native applications as possible, I
made the switch to KDE’s own browser: Falkon. What is Falkon? Falkon
started out as an independent project called QupZilla, but in 2017 it
joined the KDE project and was renamed to Falkon. It uses QtWebEngine as
its engine, which is Qt’s version of the Chromium engine, but without
all the services that talk to Google, which are stripped out. This
effectively makes it similar to using de-Googled Chromium. The downside
is that QtWebEngine does lag behind the current Chromium version;
QtWebEngine 6.8.0, the current version, is Chromium 122, while Chromium
133 is current at the time of writing. The fact that Falkon uses a
variant of the Chromium engine means websites just work, and there’s
really nothing to worry about when it comes to compatibility. Another
advantage of using QtWebEngine is that the engine is updated
independently from the browser, so even if it seems Falkon isn’t getting
much development, the engine it uses is updated regularly as part of
your distribution’s and KDE’s Qt upgrades. The downside, of course, is
that you’re using a variant of Chromium, but at least it’s de-Googled
and entirely invisible to the user. It’s definitely not great, and it
contributes to the Chromium monoculture, but I can also understand that
a project like Qt isn’t going to develop its own browser engine, and in
turn, it makes perfect sense for KDE, as a flagship Qt product, to use
it as well. It’s the practical choice, and I don’t blame either of them
for opting for what works, and what works now – the reality is that no
matter what browser you’re choose, you’re either using a browser made by
Google, or one kept afloat by Google. Pick your poison. It’s not
realistic for Qt or KDE to develop their own browser engine from
scratch, so opting for the most popular and very well funded browser
engine and strip out all of its nasty Google bits makes the most sense.
Yes, we’d all like to have more capable browser engines and thus more
competition, but we have to be realistic and understand that’s not going
to happen while developing a browser engine is as complex as developing
an entire operating system. Falkon’s issues and strengths While
rendering websites, compatibility, and even performance is excellent –
as a normal user I don’t notice any difference between running Chrome,
Firefox, or Falkon on my machines – the user interface and feature set
is where Falkon stumbles a bit. There’s a few things users have come to
expect from their browser that Falkon simply doesn’t offer yet, and
those things needs to be addressed if the KDE project wants Falkon to be
a viable alternative to Firefox and Chrome, instead of just a
languishing side project nobody uses. The biggest thing you’ll miss is
without a doubt support for modern extensions. Falkon does have support
for the deprecated PPAPI plugin interface and its own extensions system,
but there’s no support for the modern extensions API Firefox, Chrome,
and other browsers use. What this means for you as a user is that there
are effectively no extensions available for Falkon, and that’s a huge
thing to suddenly have to do without. Luckily, Falkon does have adblock
built-in, including support for custom block lists, so the most
important extension is there, but that’s it. There’s a very old bug
report/feature request about adding support for Firefox/Chrome
extensions, which in turn points to a similar feature request for
QtWebEngine to adopt support for such extensions. The gist is that for
Falkon to get support for modern Firefox and Chrome extensions, it will
have to go through QtWebEngine and thus the Qt project. While I
personally can just about get by with using the BitWarden application
(instead of the extension) and the built-in adblock, I think this is an
absolute most for most people to adopt Falkon in any serious numbers.
Most people who would consider switching to a different browser than
Chrome or Firefox are going to need extensions support. The second major
thing you’ll miss is any lack of synchronisation support. You won’t be
synchronising your bookmarks across different machines, let alone open
tabs. Of course, this extends to mobile, where Falkon has no presence,
so don’t expect to send your open tabs from your phone to your desktop
as you get home. While I don’t think this is as big of an issue as the
lack of modern extensions, it’s something I use a lot when working on
OSNews – I find stories to link to while browsing on my phone, and then
open them on my desktop to post them through the tab sharing feature of
Firefox, and</p>

id="unofficial-windows-11-mobile-is-possible-even-on-select-budget-phones-with-a-free-utility">Unofficial
Windows 11 mobile is possible even on select budget phones with a free
utility</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>Back in December 2019, Microsoft finally killed off Windows 10
Phone as it announced the end of support. The company’s grand plans with
Lumia and Windows Phones sadly never became the success it needed to be
in order to be able to compete with the likes of Android or iOS. Thus
Windows 11 Phone never became a real official thing outside of concepts.
However, there is a free unofficial way that makes it possible, albeit
the experience may not totally be free from flaws. Dubbed Project
Renegade, the mod enables users to try Windows 11 on Qualcomm Snapdragon
phones, among other devices. ↫ Sayan Sen at Neowin Windows Phone 7 and 8
were amazing, and probably my favourite mobile platform of all time. I’m
still sad that the duopoly made it impssible even for Microsoft to gain
a foothold, because their efforts definitely deserved it. They didn’t
just blindly copy Android or iOS, but came up with a truly original,
unique, and in my view, superior mobile operating system, and in a fair
market, they would’ve been rewarded for it, and Windows Phone would have
a perhaps small, but profitable segment of the market. In the vein of
Bernie can still win, I still have this faint belief that Microsoft
hasn’t completely given up on the smartphone market. Now that they’re
serious about Windows on ARM, they might use it as sneaky way to get
application developers on board, so that their applications are ready
for the big Surface Phone a few years from now, complete with Windows
Phone-inspired features and UI. I know this won’t happen, but let me
enjoy my non-existent future, please. I don’t want to rely on big tech
anymore, but I might make an exception for an up-to-date Windows Phone.
I’m only human.</p>
