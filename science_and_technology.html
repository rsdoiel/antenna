<h2 id="a-brief-history-of-the-numeric-keypad">A brief history of the
numeric keypad</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-12, from: OS News</p>
<p>The title is a lie. This isn’t brief at all. Picture the keypad of a
telephone and calculator side by side. Can you see the subtle difference
between the two without resorting to your smartphone? Don’t worry if you
can’t recall the design. Most of us are so used to accepting the common
interfaces that we tend to overlook the calculator’s inverted key
sequence. A calculator has the 7–8–9 buttons at the top whereas a phone
uses the 1–2–3 format. Subtle, but puzzling since they serve the same
functional goal — input numbers. There’s no logical reason for the
inversion if a user operates the interface in the same way. Common sense
suggests the reason should be technological constraints. Maybe it’s due
to a patent battle between the inventors. Some people may theorize it’s
ergonomics. With no clear explanation, I knew history and the evolution
of these devices would provide the answer. Which device was invented
first? Which keypad influenced the other? Most importantly, who invented
the keypad in the first place? ↫ Francesco Bertelli and Manoel do Amara
Sometimes, you come across articles that are one-of-a-kind, and this is
one of them. Very few people would go to this length to document such a
particular thing most people find utterly insignificant, but luckily for
us, Francesco Bertelli and Manoel do Amara went all the way with this
one. If you want to know anything about the history of the numerical pad
and its possibly layouts, this is the place to go. What I’ve always
found fascinating about numerical pads is how effortless the brain can
switch between the two most common layouts without really batting an
eye. Both layouts seem to ingrained in my brain that it feels like
there’s barely any context-switching involved, and my fingers just
effortlessly flow to the correct numbers. Considering numbers tend to
confuse me, I wouldn’t have been at all surprised to find myself having
issues switching between the two layouts. What makes this even more
interesting is when I consider the number row on the keyboard – you know
1 through 0 – because there I do tend to have a lot of issues finding
the right numbers. I don’t mean it takes seconds or anything like that,
but I definitely experience more hiccups working with the number row
than with a numerical keypad of either layout.</p>

<h2 id="a-brief-history-of-the-bsd-fast-filesystem">A brief history of
the BSD Fast FileSystem</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-12, from: OS News</p>
<p>We’re looking at an article from 2007 here, but I still think it’s
valuable and interesting, especially from a historical perspective. I
first started working on the UNIX file system with Bill Joy in the late
1970s. I wrote the Fast File System, now called UFS, in the early 1980s.
In this article, I have written a survey of the work that I and others
have done to improve the BSD file systems. Much of this research has
been incorporated into other file systems. ↫ Marshall Kirk McKusic
Variants of UFS are still the default file system in at least NetBSD and
OpenBSD, and it’s one of the two default options in FreeBSD (alongside
ZFS). In other words, this article, and the work described therein, is
still relevant to this very day.</p>
