id="mozilla-reaffirms-it-wont-remove-manifest-v2-support-from-firefox">Mozilla
reaffirms it won’t remove Manifest v2 support from Firefox</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-26, from: OS News</p>
<p>Mozilla has officially reiterated that it’s going to keep offering
support for both Manifest v2 and Manifest v3 extensions in Firefox.
Google is removing support for Manifest v2 from Chrome, and with it a
feature called blockingWebRequest that is used by ad blockers like
uBlock Origin. Google’s replacement for that feature is more restrictive
and less capable, and as such, uBlock Origin no longer works on Chrome.
Firefox, however, will continue supporting both blockingWebRequest and
declarativeNetRequest — giving developers more flexibility and keeping
powerful privacy tools available to users. ↫ Scott DeVaney and Ed
Sullivan There’s a lot to be worried about when it comes to Mozilla’s
future, but on this matter, at least, they’re taking the correct stance
that genuinely puts users first. It’s no surprise Google is using
Manifest v3 as an excuse to nerf adblocking in Chrome, since adblocking
cuts into Google’s most important source of revenue. If you’re still
using Chrome, this alone should be more than enough reason to switch to
Firefox, so you can retain the most optimal form of adblocking. The
various Chromium skins will most likely all lose support for Manifest v2
as well once the code is actually removed from Chromium in June 2025.
Vivaldi announced as such, and unless any of the other Chromium skins
out there decide to fork Chromium and maintain their own version, you
can expect all of them to lose support for Manifest v2 around the same
date. Safari is harder to pin down, since Apple doesn’t make any
statements about future product. For now, it supports both Manifest v2
and v3, and I don’t really see a reason why Apple would remove v2
support.</p>

<h2 id="years-of-incubating-wayland-color-management">12 years of
incubating Wayland color management</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-26, from: OS News</p>
<p>The Wayland color-management protocol extension has landed on Feb
13th, 2025, in upstream wayland-protocols repository in the staging
directory. It was released with wayland-protocols 1.41. The extension
enables proper interactions between traditional (sRGB), Wide Color Gamut
(WCG), and High Dynamic Range (HDR) image sources and displays once
implemented in Wayland compositors and used in applications. Of course,
a protocol is just a language. Two participants need to speak the same
language for the language to be of any use: Wayland compositors and a
component on the application side (e.g., a toolkit library). Major
efforts have been going on in various projects to prove and take
advantage of the protocol, including KWin, Mutter, Weston, wlroots,
GStreamer, GTK, Qt, SDL, Mesa, and mpv. Support in Mesa means that
applications will be able to render and display in HDR by using the
relevant EGL and Vulkan features. ↫ Pekka Paalanen Colour management has
been an important missing piece of the Wayland puzzle, so it’s good to
see this finally released and added to Wayland as a new protocol after
so many years of work. It’s important to note that the work done so far
focuses almost entirely on the entertainment side of things, like
watching video or playing games. The other important side, professional
colour management for things like photo editing or desktop publishing,
is still missing, with the major holdup being measuring physical monitor
response (measuring a reference image displayed on a monitor with a
hardware device).</p>

<h2 id="xcode-phones-home-a-lot-and-that-should-worry-you">Xcode phones
home a lot, and that should worry you</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-25, from: OS News</p>
<p>I’ve saved the worst for last. For some reason, Xcode phones home to
appstoreconnect.apple.com every time I open an Xcode project. This also
appears to be unnecessary, and I experience no problems after denying
the connections in Little Snitch, so I do! I assume that the connections
send identifying information about the Xcode project to Apple, otherwise
why even make the connections when opening a project? And all of these
connections from Xcode, to every domain, require login to your Apple
Developer account, so Apple is definitely receiving identifying
information about you in any case. In effect, Xcode is a developer
analytics collection mechanism, whether you like it or not, which I
don’t. ↫ Jeff Johnson If, at this point in time, you’re still surprised
Apple doesn’t practice what it preaches, the fault lies pretty much
entirely with you. Anyway, it seems Xcode phones home to Apple quite a
bit, which I doubt is all that unique in the world of commercial
development environments. I honestly don’t think Apple itself doing
anything particularly nefarious with this data, but the fact it’s
collecting it in the first place should still make you think twice about
using Xcode, especially if you’re developing anything even remotely
sensitive. What should really worry you is the fact Tim Cook and Apple
are close allies of Trump and his regime. Xcode is required for
iOS/iPadOS/etc. development, because the App Store requires applications
be built and submitted with it. As such, every iOS developer is sending
substantial amounts of data to Apple during development, which should be
especially concerning for people outside of the US and people who aren’t
straight white males; using Xcode requires an Apple Account, so Apple
knows quite a bit about who is using it. With the breakdown of the rule
of law in the US, all of this data is basically freely accessible to US
authorities, and we’ve seen by now that people like self-styled genius
Elon Musk don’t worry too much about pesky things like the rule of law.
If Musk wants this data, Apple will hand it over. If you’re an Apple
developer, you should stop and think every time you open Xcode. You’re
sending your data straight to a hostile entity. If you’re claiming to
use Apple products because of Apple’s privacy “promises”, Xcode’s data
collection should be a huge worry for you.</p>

gives OEMs the option of 8 years of Android updates</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-25, from: OS News</p>
<p>Starting with Android smartphones running on the Snapdragon 8 Elite
Mobile Platform, Qualcomm Technologies now offers device manufacturers
the ability to provide support for up to eight consecutive years of
Android software and security updates. Smartphones launching on new
Snapdragon 8 and 7-series mobile platforms will also be eligible to
receive this extended support. ↫ Mike Genewich I mean, good news of
course, but Qualcomm has a history of making empty promises, so I’ll see
it when I believe it. Also note that this news doesn’t mean every
Snapdragon 8 Elite Android device will get eight years of updates – it
just means OEMs are able to offer such support now, not that they’ll
actually do it. Considering it’s usually the OEMs refusing to offer
updates, I wonder just how big the actual impact of this news will be.
In any event, this includes both regular Android updates as well as two
Android Common Kernel upgrades, which are required to meet this eight
year window. If you want to get into the nitty-gritty about Android and
the Android Common Kernels, the official Android documentation has more
details.</p>

is no longer safe to move our governments and societies to US
clouds</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-24, from: OS News</p>
<p>We now have the bizarre situation that anyone with any sense can see
that America is no longer a reliable partner, and that the entire US
business world bows to Trump’s dictatorial will, but we STILL are doing
everything we can to transfer entire governments and most of our own
businesses to their clouds. Not only is it scary to have all your data
available to US spying, it is also a huge risk for your
business/government continuity. From now on, all our business processes
can be brought to a halt with the push of a button in the US. And not
only will everything then stop, will we ever get our data back? Or are
we being held hostage? This is not a theoretical scenario, something
like this has already happened. ↫ Bert Hubert The cold and harsh reality
is that the alliance between the United States and Europe, the
single-most powerful alliance in human history, is over. Voters in the
United States prefer their country ally itself with the brutal and
genocidal dictator of Russia, instead of being allied with the
democratic and free nations of Europe. That’s their choice to make,
their consequences to face, and inevitably, their cross to bear.
Governments in Europe have not yet fully accepted that they can no
longer rely on the United States for, well, anything. Whether it be
existential, like needing to shore up defense spending and possibly
unifying European militaries, or something more mundane, like which
computer systems European governments use, the United States should be
treated in much the same way as Russia or China. Europe has to fend for
itself, spend on itself, and build for itself, instead of assuming that
the Americans will come through on any “promise” they make. An
unreliable partner like the US is a massive liability. Bert Hubert is
exactly right. European data needs to be stored within European borders.
Just as we wouldn’t store our data on servers owned or controlled by the
Chinese government, we shouldn’t be storing our data on servers owned or
controlled by the US government. The general European public is already
changing its buying habits – it’s time our governments do so too.</p>

<h2 id="sailfish-os-5.0-released-for-all-supported-devices">Sailfish OS
5.0 released for all supported devices</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-24, from: OS News</p>
<p>Sailfish OS 5.0, originally released late last year as part of the
new Jolla C2 Community Phone, will now be pushed to all Sailfish OS
devices. There have been several other minor releases since the original
release, so if you’re running Sailfish OS on something other than the
C2, you’re getting a release with some more bugfixes and improvements.
The main improvement is an upgrade to Gecko ESR91, with work underway to
move to ESR102 – this is far from the latest release, but sticking to
ESR releases seems like a wise idea for a smaller team. This release
also upgrades the Android application support to Android 13 (API level
33), and adds the microG 0.3.6 enablers. There’s Wireguard support now,
call blocking, and new landscape view for a variety of applications.
Incidentally, I was one of the first people to publish a review of the
original Jolla Phone, exactly 11 years ago in 2014. Since I was such an
early adopter, I have the The First One version, and it just so happens
I’m also one of the very few people who actually received the Jolla
Tablet, after being an extremely early backer of that device, too. I
still have both of them, and especially the Jolla Phone I used as my
main device for quite a while – half a year to a year, or so – before
going back to Android. I’m glad Sailfish OS is still going, and I’m
definitely interested in giving this new release a go. I would need to
buy the Jolla C2 Community Phone, and if finances allow, I may actually
do so. In case you want to help, feel free to become an OSNews Patreon

<h2 id="microsoft-improves-windows-11s-start-menu-somewhat">Microsoft
improves Windows 11’s Start menu somewhat</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-24, from: OS News</p>
<p>Microsoft seems to be addressing some of the oddities with the
Windows 11 Start menu, finally adding basic views that should’ve been in
Windows 11 since the very start. We’re introducing two new views to the
“All” page in the Start menu: grid and category view. Grid and list view
shows your apps in alphabetical order and category view groups all your
apps into categories, ordered by usage. This change is gradually rolling
out so you may not see it right away. We plan to begin rolling this out
to Windows Insiders who are receiving updates based on Windows 11,
version 24H2 in the Dev and Beta Channels soon. ↫ Amanda Langowski and
Brandon LeBlanc These new views are very welcome, but sadly, you still
can’t set them as the default view in the Start menu. You’re still
forced to use whatever that default view is, and click on “All” to get
to these new views, instead of being available right as you open the
Start menu. I messed around with Windows 11 on my XPS 13 9370 for a few
weeks as I waited for a review laptop to arrive, and I couldn’t last for
a few hours without buying a replacement for the Start menu that allowed
me to have a working, non-terrible menu that I could configure to my own
needs. It’s wild to me that such an iconic element of the Windows user
interface is in such a dire, unliked state. We all know Windows seems to
be a in a bit of a rut, with Microsoft investing more in nonsense like
“AI” and ads in the operating system than in actually listening to users
and improving their experience. It’s been roughly thirty years since the
introduction of the Start menu, and the original one from Windows 95 is
still superior to whatever’s in Windows now. Wild.</p>

<p>date: 2025-02-24, from: OS News</p>
<p>Last year somebody reported a problem with the DOS 3.3 SYS.COM
command when used with NetDrive. They started with a valid FAT12 image,
ran SYS.COM to make it bootable, and then they were not able to mount
the image using NetDrive again. Running SYS.COM against the image had
broken something. Besides copying the operating system’s hidden files to
the target drive letter, SYS.COM also copies some boot code into the
first sector of the disk. In general it does not make sense to run it
against a NetDrive image because you already had to boot DOS to mount
the image, but it should not hurt anything. So I decided to have a look
at what was going on. ↫ Michael Brutman A good old classic bug hunt in
some retro DOS code from roughly 1987. This one’s a bit more technical
and in-depth than these things usually are, and quite a bit of it goes
over my head, but I’m sure since most of you are much smarter than I am,
you’ll do a better job understanding what’s going on.</p>

<h2 id="illumos-on-sparc-possible-but-problematic">Illumos on SPARC:
possible, but problematic</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-23, from: OS News</p>
<p>While SPARC may no longer be supported by the main Illumos project,
it still works and is still viable. This page brings together a variety
of information regarding Illumos on SPARC, not necessarily limited to
Tribblix. ↫ Tribblix website It seems running Tribblix – and other
Illumos-based distributions – on SPARC is still possible, but there are
some serious limitations anyone who has tried to use even slightly older
operating systems will be fairly familiar with. For instance, since
there’s no Rust for Illumos on SPARC, Firefox and other applications
that use it are not available, and Tribblix in particular no longer
builds Pale Moon (or LibreOffice). Rust is available on Solaris 11,
though, so it may be possible to bring it to Illumos. In a similar vein,
Go also isn’t available for SPARC either. As far as hardware support
goes, it’s a bit of a mixed bag, as systems that should work do, in
fact, not, and even systems that do work run into a very familiar
problem: graphics card support is a big issue. This is a problem
plaguing X.org on any outdated or sidelined architecture, and it seems
Illumos is also affected. Obviously, this greatly reduces the usefulness
of Illumos on workstations, but is less of an issue on servers. You’ll
run into the same problem when trying to run NetBSD, OpenBSD, or Linux
in, say, PA-RISC hardware. Of course, the problem is both a lack of
people interested in and capable of contributing to keeping stuff
running on older architectures, further spurred on by a dwindling supply
of hardware available at reasonable prices. Sad, but there isn’t much
that can be done about it.</p>
