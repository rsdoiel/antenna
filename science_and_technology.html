id="if-you-dont-like-current-macos-why-not-keep-using-mac-os-x-10.9-mavericks">If
you don’t like current macOS, why not keep using Mac OS X 10.9
Mavericks?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-08, from: OS News</p>
<p>With Apple’s desktop operating systems straying ever further from
what some of us consider its heyday, it’s no surprise people long for
the days before Apple started relentlessly focusing on services revenue,
bringing iOS paradigms to macOS, and dropping its Aqua design language
for whatever they’re doing now. Some people take this longing and
channel it into something a bit more concrete, and an example of this is
a website I stumbled upon on Fedi: Mavericks Forever. Mavericks Forever
is a detailed guide to, as the name implies, keep using Mac OS X 10.9
Mavericks. It covers everything from hardware options to security
patches, browser choices, and so, so much more. It even goes as far as
adding more recent emoji releases, custom security patches, and visual
customisations. There’s a ton to go over here, and of course, you don’t
have to implement every single suggestions. I ostensibly like pain,
because I’ve had a soft spot for the trash can Mac Pro ever since they
came out. Now that they are wholly and completely outdated by Apple
standards, their prices are probably dropping rapidly, so I may have to
grab one from eBay or whatever and follow this guide for a modern-ish
Mavericks setup. I do actually like the Mac OS X of old quite a bit, I
would love to have a usable version of it that I can use when I feel
like it. If only to remember the good old days.</p>

<h2 id="google-ends-steam-for-chromebook-effort">Google ends Steam for
Chromebook effort</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-08, from: OS News</p>
<p>In 2022, Google launched a major push for gaming Chromebooks,
including a version of Steam for ChromeOS. Steam for ChromeOS remained
in Google’s nebulous “beta” state ever since, however, and today Google
is doing a Google by killing Steam for ChromeOS altogether. Entering
“Steam” into the ChromeOS Launcher starts the install process like
before, but there’s now an intermediary message: “The Steam for
Chromebook Beta program will conclude on January 1st, 2026. After this
date, games installed as part of the Beta will no longer be available to
play on your device. We appreciate your participation in and
contribution to learnings from the beta program, which will inform the
future of Chromebook gaming.” ↫ Abner Li at 9To5Google Chromebooks are
cheap devices for students, and while there are expensive, powerful
Chromebooks, I doubt they sell in any meaningful numbers to justify
spending any time on maintaining Steam for ChromeOS. Of course, Steam
for ChromeOS is just the Linux version of Steam, but Google did maintain
a list of “compatible” games, so the company was at least doing
something. The list consists of 99 games, by the way. It’s just another
example of Google seemingly having no idea what it wants to do with its
operating systems, made worse in this case because Google actually had
OEMs make and sell Chromebooks with gaming features. Sure, Android games
still exist and can be run on ChromeOS, but I doubt that’s what the six
people who bought a gaming Chromebook for actual gaming had in mind when
they bought one.</p>

<h2 id="age-verification-whats-the-harm">Age verification: what’s the
harm?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>Welcome, friends, to my grubby little corner of the internet. A
corner so strewn with obscenity that the UK government has decided you
must prove you’re a grown-up before you can access certain parts of it.
The UK’s new Online Safety Act has come into force, so UK people might
have noticed a bunch of websites suddenly demanding you take a selfie,
share your credit card details, or jump through another hoop to prove
that you’re over 18. Quite a few of my friends have been discussing this
in the pub, because for understandable reasons people who aren’t
embedded in the world of online pornography or internet law are suddenly
curious about why the internet is now so very broken. They’re also often
convinced that the government will change its mind and therefore no one
really needs to worry. I’ve had this conversation so many times now that
I reckon I’ve got the basis for a fairly solid layperson’s guide to age
verification: what it is, how it affects you, and why we absolutely,
genuinely do need to worry. ↫ Girl on the Net Girl on the Net basically
published the definitive guide on why age verification online, as
currently implemented in the United Kingdom, and explored by the United
States and the European Union, is such a terrible idea. It’s a privacy
disaster, a clear onramp for Christian extremists to go after LGBTQ+
content, it doesn’t “protect the children”, it’s easily circumvented,
breaks accessibility, casts such a wide net that it even hits sites like
Wikipedia, and so, so much more. Whenever anyone online tries to sell
you on age verification as a means to “think of the children”, you can
just point them to the linked article. If, after reading it, they still
believe this is the way to protect children from seeing naked people
(while leaving the door to the most brutal forms of violent content wide
open, of course, as is tradition), they will have either ulterior
motives, or are some form of extremist you can’t argue with anyway. The
demonization of sexual content and the sex workers that produce it as a
means to introduce strict authoritarian control over the internet is
something that will never go away. “Think of the children” is an
incredibly powerful rallying cry for authoritarians to scare sheltered
boomers into accepting pretty much any draconian measure, regardless of
efficacy, and I doubt we will ever definitely win this fight. But we
won’t have to sit down and accept it.</p>

id="that-time-microsoft-forgot-the-southern-hemispheres-seasons-are-opposite-to-the-northern-hemispheres">That
time Microsoft forgot the southern hemisphere’s seasons are opposite to
the northern hemisphere’s</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-06, from: OS News</p>
<p>Whether you like Microsoft and its products or not, the one thing we
can all agree on is that the company is absolutely terrible at naming
things. Sometimes I feel like managers at Microsoft get their bonuses
based on how many times they can rename products, because I find it hard
to accept that they’re really that inept at product naming in Redmond. I
mean, just look at my recent article about the most Microsoft support
document of all time. Bonkers. While the list of examples of confusing,
weird, unclear, and strange Microsoft product names is long, let’s go
back to that weird moment in time where Windows updates were suddenly
given names like the “Fall Creators Update”. As with every naming scheme
Microsoft introduces, this one was short-lived, but for once, we have an
explanation. Raymond Chen explains: It was during an all-hands meeting
that a senior executive asked if the organization had any unconscious
biases. One of my colleagues raised his hand. He grew up in the Southern
Hemisphere, where the seasons are opposite from those in the Northern
Hemisphere. He pointed out that naming the updates Spring and Fall shows
a Northern Hemisphere bias and is not inclusive of our customers in the
Southern Hemisphere. The names of the semiannual releases were changed
the next day to be hemisphere-neutral. ↫ Raymond Chen If you live in the
northern hemisphere – and you can’t live much more north than I do – you
don’t often have to think about how the seasons in the southern
hemisphere are reversed. We all know it – I assume, at least – but it’s
not something that we’re confronted with very often, as our media,
movies, books, and so on, all tend to be made in and for consumers in
the northern hemisphere. I’m assuming that people in the southern
hemisphere are much more acutely aware of this issue, because their
media is probably dominated by stories set in the northern hemisphere,
too. It’s wild that Microsoft ever went with a seasonal naming scheme to
begin with, and that it somehow slipped through the cracks for a while
before anyone spoke up.</p>

Virtual Environment 9.0 with Debian 13 released</h2>

<p>Main highlight of this update is a modernized core built upon Debian
13 “Trixie”, ensuring a robust foundation for the platform. Proxmox VE
9.0 further introduces significant advancements in both storage and
networking capabilities, addressing critical enterprise demands. A
highlight is the long-awaited support for snapshots on thick-provisioned
LVM shared storage, improving storage management capabilities especially
for enterprise users with Fibre Channel (FC) or iSCSI SAN environments.
With newly added “fabric” support for Software-Defined Networking (SDN),
administrators can construct highly complex and scalable network
architectures. ↫ Proxmox press release I’ve only very recently accepted
the gospel of Proxmox, and I now have a little mini PC running Proxmox,
hosting a Debian Pi-Hole container, a 9front virtual machine, and a
Windows 7 retro virtual machine. I’m intending to use it as an easy
shortcut for running retro stuff, as well as any fun tools I might run
into that work best in a container. I haven’t updated yet to this new
release, but I’m interested to see how easy the upgrade process will be.
Considering it’s just Debian, it can’t be too involved. I’m curious of
anyone else here is using Proxmox or similar tools at home, or at work
for more complex use cases.</p>

<p>date: 2025-08-06, from: OS News</p>
<p>As promised in the first iteration, we will now explore how GPU
drivers work in more detail by exploring an application known as VkCube.
As the program name implies, this application uses the Vulkan API to
render a rotating cube on the screen. Its simplicity makes it a prime
candidate to be used as a learning aid in our journey through GPU
drivers. This article will first introduce the concept of User Mode
Drivers (UMDs) and Kernel Mode Drivers (KMDs), breaking down the steps
needed to actually describe VkCube‘s workload to the GPU. This will be
done in a more compact way for brevity as it’s a rather extensive topic
that has been detailed in several books. We will wrap up with an
overview of the actual API offered by Tyr. As previously stated, this is
the same API offered by Panthor, which is the C driver for the same
hardware. ↫ Daniel Almeida There isn’t much to add here, except maybe
this kitten.</p>

<h4>
Forget building massive super clusters. Cobble them together from
existing datacenters instead
</h4>
<p>
Broadcom on Monday unveiled a new switch which could allow AI model
developers to train models on GPUs spread across multiple datacenters up
to 100 kilometers apart. The switch could help pave the way for an
alternative to the massive facilities currently being built to power the
AI boom, allowing companies to stitch together distant and less
power-hungry datacenters.…

id="windows-nt-4.0-set-us-on-the-path-to-windows-nt-desktop-dominance">Windows
NT 4.0 set us on the path to Windows NT desktop dominance</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>The most popular desktop operating system today is still Windows,
with its userbase roughly equally divided between Windows 10 and Windows
11. While we tend to focus on the marketing names used by Microsoft,
like Windows XP, Windows 7, or Windows 11, their real name is still, to
this day, Windows NT. Underneath all the marketing names, there’s still
the Windows NT version number corresponding to the marketing name;
Windows XP was Windows NT 5.1 (or 5.2 for the 64bit version), Windows 7
was Windows NT 6.1, and the current latest version, Windows 11, is
Windows NT 10.0, a version number that’s been static since 2015. Of
course, version numbers don’t really mean anything, but it does
highlight that yes, the Windows you’re using is still Windows NT, and
thus, the operating system you’re using isn’t a part of the Windows
3.x/9x line, but of the NT line. And probably the first version of
Windows NT that set us on this path is Windows NT 4.0 – with Windows
2000 sealing the deal, and Windows XP delivering the obvious knock-out
punch. Since Windows NT 4.0 turned 29 years old a few days ago, Dave
Farquhar published a retrospective of this release, highlighting many
important changes in Windows NT 4.0 that in my mind mark it as the true
beginning of the shift from Windows 9x to Windows NT as Microsoft’s
consumer operating system. First, Windows NT 4.0 was the first version
of Windows NT that shipped with the user interface from Windows 95. It
brought over the Start menu, taskbar, and everything else introduced
with Windows 95 to the Windows NT line, which up until that point had
been using the same user interface as Windows 3.x. A default Windows NT
4.0 desktop basically looks indistinguishable from a Windows 95 desktop,
and like the earlier versions of NT, it came in a workstation edition
for desktop use. Second, another massive, at the time controversial,
change came with the graphics subsystem, as Farquhar notes: And one
change, easily forgotten today, regarded graphics drivers. Microsoft
moved the video subsystem from user space, ring 3, to kernel space, ring
0. There was a lot of talk about Ring 0 versus ring 3 on July 19, 2024
thanks to the large computer outage on that day. In 1996, this move was
controversial, for the same reasons. The fear was that a malfunction in
the graphics driver would now be able to take down the entire system.
But the trade-off was much improved performance. It meant Windows NT 4.0
could be used for serious graphics work. ↫ Dave Farquhar Windows NT 4.0
delivered more than what’s highlighted by Farquhar, of course. A major
new feature in Windows NT 4.0 was DirectX, as it was the first Windows
version to come with it preinstalled. DirectX support remained limited
in NT 4.0, though, so Windows 9x remained the better option for most
people playing video games. Other new features were the System Policy
Editor and system policies, Sysprep, and, of course, a whole slew of
low-level improvements to both the operating system itself as well as
its various server-oriented features. Windows NT 4.0 also happened to be
the last version of Windows NT which supported the Alpha, MIPS, and
PowerPC architectures, although Windows 2000 retained support for Alpha
in its alpha, beta, and release candidate versions. Of course, Windows
would later expand its architecture support with first Itanium, and more
recently, ARM. As someone who was selling and managing computer systems
at the time, Farquhar has some great insights into why NT 4.0 was such a
big deal, and why it seemed to fare better in the market than previous
versions of Windows NT did. He also highlights on particular oddity from
NT 4.0 that’s still lurking around today, an oddity you really don’t
want to run into.</p>

<h2 id="replacing-an-amigas-brain-with-doom">Replacing an Amiga’s brain
with Doom</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>There’s a lovely device called a pistorm, an adapter board that glues
a Raspberry Pi GPIO bus to a Motorola 68000 bus. The intended use case
is that you plug it into a 68000 device and then run an emulator that
reads instructions from hardware (ROM or RAM) and emulates them. You’re
still limited by the ~7MHz bus that the hardware is running at, but you
can run the instructions as fast as you want. These days you’re supposed
to run a custom built OS on the Pi that just does 68000 emulation, but
initially it ran Linux on the Pi and a userland 68000 emulator process.
And, well, that got me thinking. The emulator takes 68000 instructions,
emulates them, and then talks to the hardware to implement the effects
of those instructions. What if we, well, just don’t? What if we just run
all of our code in Linux on an ARM core and then talk to the Amiga
hardware? ↫ Matthew Garrett This is so cursed. I love it.</p>

is using stealth, undeclared crawlers to evade website no-crawl
directives</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-04, from: OS News</p>
<p>We are observing stealth crawling behavior from Perplexity, an
AI-powered answer engine. Although Perplexity initially crawls from
their declared user agent, when they are presented with a network block,
they appear to obscure their crawling identity in an attempt to
circumvent the website’s preferences. We see continued evidence that
Perplexity is repeatedly modifying their user agent and changing their
source ASNs to hide their crawling activity, as well as ignoring — or
sometimes failing to even fetch — robots.txt files. The Internet as we
have known it for the past three decades is rapidly changing, but one
thing remains constant: it is built on trust. There are clear
preferences that crawlers should be transparent, serve a clear purpose,
perform a specific activity, and, most importantly, follow website
directives and preferences. Based on Perplexity’s observed behavior,
which is incompatible with those preferences, we have de-listed them as
a verified bot and added heuristics to our managed rules that block this
stealth crawling. ↫ The CloudFlare Blog Never forget they destroyed
Aaron Swartz’s life – literally – for downloading a few JSTOR

<h2 id="orbitiny-desktop-1.0-pilot-4-released">Orbitiny Desktop 1.0
Pilot 4 released</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>It’s not every day you stumble upon an X11 desktop environment you’ve
never hard of, but today’s one of those days. The Orbitiny Desktop
Environment is a one-person project, consisting of an entirely custom
desktop environment written in Qt. Version 1.0 Pilot 4 was just
released. Built from the ground up using Qt and coded in C++, Orbitiny
Desktop is a new, 100% portable, innovative and traditional but modern
looking desktop environment for Linux. Innovative because it has
features not seen in any other desktop environment before while keeping
traditional aspects of computing alive (desktop icons, menus etc).
Portable because you can run it on any distro and on any live CD and
that’s because everything gets saved inside the directory that gets
created when the archive is extracted (this can be changed so that the
settings go to $HOME/.config/orbitiny). ↫ Orbitiny Desktop Environment
Gitea page It’s got all the usual amenities like a desktop, panels, and
so on, and a custom file manager. It’s also replete with a ton of small
features that you don’t see very often, like full mouse gesture support
on the desktop and a device manager that can enable/disable devices
without blacklisting kernel modules. When you cut or copy a file, its
icon will get a little emblem to indicate it’s on the clipboard, you can
append and prepend files using simple drag-and-drop operations, you can
set individual desktop directories for each virtual desktop, and much
more. Now, it’s technically not a full desktop environment, because it
doesn’t have things like a session manager, power manager, various
hardware configuration panels, and so on, but it can be run on top of
existing desktop environments. While it has basic Wayland support, not
all components work there, so X11 is the main focus for now. Considering
it’s a one-person project, you can’t expect a bug or issue-free
experience, but that doesn’t mean it’s any less damn impressive. I
honestly feel like there’s something valuable and interesting here, and
I’d love for more people to get involved to see where this can go.
There’s clearly a ton of love and dedication here, and the various
unique features clearly set it apart from everything else. If you have
the skills, consider helping out.</p>

to Qubes OS when you do not know what it is</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>Solène Rapenne, who writes a lot about and contributes to operating
systems like OpenBSD and Qubes OS, has published a primer about what,
exactly, Qubes OS is. I like to call Qubes OS a meta operating system,
because it is not a Linux / BSD / Windows based OS: its core is Xen
(some kind of virtualization enabled kernel). Not only it’s Xen based,
but by design it is meant to run virtual machines, hence the name “meta
operating system” which is an OS meant to run many OSes make sense to
me. ↫ Solène Rapenne Rapenne explains the various ways in which isolated
virtual machines are used in Qubes OS, and it’s easy to see just how
secure Qubes OS’ way of doing things is. At the same time, it seems
quite cumbersome to me as a regular user, and I don’t think I’m up for
dealing with all of that. If you do security research, handle private or
classified data, are a whistleblower or an investigative journalist,
thoug, Qubes seems like a natural choice. Interesting to note is that
Rapenne used to use OpenBSD for her security work, but moved to Qubes OS
because its virtual machine infrastructure is far more robust, and
hardware support is better, as well.</p>

real PowerBook: the Macintosh Application Environment on a PA-RISC
laptop</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>In October 1997 you could have bought a PowerBook 3400c running up to
a 240MHz PowerPC 603e for $6500 , which was briefly billed as the
world’s fastest laptop, or you could have bought this monster new to the
market, the RDI PrecisionBook running up to a 160MHz (later 180MHz)
PA-7300LC starting at $12,000 . Both provided onboard Ethernet, SCSI and
CardBus PCMCIA slots. On the other hand, while the 3400c had an internal
media bay for either a floppy or CD-ROM, both external options on the
PrecisionBook, the PrecisionBook gave you a 1024×768 LCD (versus 800×600
on the 3400c), a bigger keyboard, at least two 2.5″ hard disk bays and
up to 512MB of RAM (versus 144MB) — and HP-UX. And, through the magic of
Apple’s official Macintosh Application Environment, you could do
anything on it an HP PA-RISC workstation could do and run 68K Mac
software on it at the same time. Look at the photograph and see: on our
160MHz unit we’ve got HP-UX 11.00 CDE running simultaneously with a full
Macintosh System 7.5.3 desktop. Yes, only a real Power Mac could run
PowerPC software back then, but 68K software was still plentiful and
functional. Might this have been a viable option to have your expensive
cake and eat it too? We’ll find out and run some real apps on it
(including that game we must all try running), analyze its performance
and technical underpinnings, and uncover an unusual artifact of its
history hidden in the executable. ↫ Cameron Kaiser at Old Vintage
Computing Research I actually have Apple’s Macintosh Application
Environment installed and running on my PA-RISC machines, and it’s
incredible just how well-made and complete it really is. You get a full
Mac desktop and its applications, excellent integration with the host,
file sharing between host and client, and so much more. Running it on
newer versions of HP-UX than it was originally intended for does lead to
the odd issue here and there, but due to HP-UX’ excellent backwards
compatibility, it all just works. It has created this odd situation that
my 2004 HP c8000 machine, with two of the fastest dual-core PA-RISC
processors ever made, will most likely be the fastest machine I’ll ever
officially run classic Mac OS on. Sure, you can use other emulators not
created and blessed by Apple and run classic Mac OS on much faster
hardware, but if you want to stick to official, supported methods of
running the classic Mac OS, it doesn’t get much faster than this.</p>

deleted my 10-year account and all data without warning”</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>AWS: Not even once. This prominent Ruby developer lost his entire
test environment – which, ironically, was pivotal to AWS’ own
infrastructure – because of a rogue team within AWS itself that
apparently answers to no one and worked hard to cover up a dumb mistake.
On July 23, 2025, AWS deleted my 10-year-old account and every byte of
data I had stored with them. No warning. No grace period. No recovery
options. Just complete digital annihilation. This is the story of a
catastrophic internal mistake at AWS MENA, a 20-day support nightmare
where I couldn’t get a straight answer to “Does my data still exist?”,
and what it reveals about trusting cloud providers with your data. ↫
