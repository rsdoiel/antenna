Foundation lays off 30% of its employees, ends advocacy for open web,
privacy, and more</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-08, from: OS News</p>
<p>More bad news from Mozilla. The Mozilla Foundation, the nonprofit arm
of the Firefox browser maker Mozilla, has laid off 30% of its employees
as the organization says it faces a “relentless onslaught of change.”
Announcing the layoffs in an email to all employees on October 30, the
Mozilla Foundation’s executive director Nabiha Syed confirmed that two
of the foundation’s major divisions — advocacy and global programs — are
“no longer a part of our structure.” ↫ Zack Whittaker at TechCrunch This
means Mozilla will no longer be advocating for an open web, privacy, and
related ideals, which fits right in with the organisation’s steady
decline into an ad-driven effort that also happens to be making a web
browser used by, I’m sorry to say, effectively nobody. I just don’t know
how many more signs people need to see before realising that the future
of Firefox is very much at stake, and that we’re probably only a few
years away from losing the only non-big tech browser out there. This
should be a much bigger concern than it seems to be to especially the
Linux and BSD world, who rely heavily on Firefox, without a valid
alternative to shift to once the browser’s no longer compatible with the
various open source requirements enforced by Linux distributions and the
BSDs. What this could also signal is that the sword of Damocles dangling
above Mozilla’s head is about to come down, and that the people involved
know more than we do. Google is effectively bankrolling Mozilla – for
about 80% of its revenue – but that deal has come under increasing
scrutiny from regulars, and Google itself, too, must be wondering why
they’re wasting money supporting a browser nobody’s using. We’re very
close to a web ruled by Google and Apple. If that prospect doesn’t
utterly terrify you, I honestly wonder what you’re doing here, reading
this.</p>

id="fedora-kde-approved-to-become-of-equal-status-to-fedora-gnome">Fedora
KDE approved to become of equal status to Fedora GNOME</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-08, from: OS News</p>
<p>Earlier this year, a proposal was made to replace the primary edition
of Fedora from the GNOME variant to the KDE variant. This proposal,
while serious, was mostly intended to stir up discussion about the
position of the Fedora KDE spin within the larger Fedora community, and
it seems this has had its intended effect. A different, but related
proposal, to make Fedora KDE equal in status to the Fedora GNOME
variant, has been accepted. The original proposal read: After a few
months of being live, the proposal has now been unanimously accepted,
which means that starting with Fedora 42, the GNOME and KDE versions
will have equal status, and thus will receive equal marketing and
positioning on the website. Considering how many people really enjoy
Fedora KDE, this is a great outcome, and probably the fairest way to
handle the situation for a distribution as popular as Fedora. I use
Fedora KDE on all my machines, so for me, this is great news.</p>

<h2 id="lxqt-2.1.0-released-with-optional-wayland-session">LXQt 2.1.0
released with optional Wayland session</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>LXQt, the desktop environment that is to KDE what Xfce is to GNOME,
has released version 2.1.0, and while the version number change seems
average, it’s got a big ace up its sleeve: you can now run LXQt in a
Wayland session, and they claim it works quite well, too, and it
supports a wide variety of compositors. Through its new
component lxqt-wayland-session, LXQt 2.1.0 supports 7 Wayland sessions
(with Labwc, KWin, Wayfire, Hyprland, Sway, River and Niri), has two
Wayland back-ends in lxqt-panel (one for kwin_wayland and the other
general), and will add more later. All LXQt components that are not
limited to X11 — i.e., most components — work fine on Wayland. The
sessions are available in the new section Wayland Settings inside LXQt
Session Settings. At least one supported Wayland compositor should be
installed in addition to lxqt-wayland-session for it to be used. There
is still hard work to do, but all of the current LXQt Wayland sessions
are quite usable; their differences are about what the supported Wayland
compositors provide. ↫ LXQt 2.1.0 release announcement This is great
news for LXQt, as it ensures the desktop environment is ready to keep up
with what modern Linux distributions provide. Crucially and in line with
what we’ve come to expect from LXQt, X11 support is a core part of the
project, and they even go so far as to say “the X11 session will be
supported indefinitely”, which should set people preferring to stay on
X11 at ease. I personally may have gleefully left X11 in the dustbin of
history, but many among us haven’t, and it’s welcome to see LXQt’s clear
promise here. Many of the other improvements in this release are tied to
Wayland, making sure the various components work and Wayland settings
can be adjusted. On top of that, there’s the usual list of bug fixes and
smaller changes, too.</p>

<h2 id="microsoft-improves-its-prism-x86-on-arm-emulator">Microsoft
improves its Prism x86-on-ARM emulator</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>The current version of Windows on ARM contains Prism, Microsoft’s
emulator that allows x86-64 code to run on ARM processors. While it was
already relatively decent on the recent Snapdragon X platform, it could
still be very hit-or-miss with what applications it would run, and
especially games seemed to be problematic. As such, Microsoft has pushed
out a major update to Prism that adds support for a whole bunch of
extensions to the x86 architecture. This new support in Prism is already
in limited use today in the retail version of Windows 11, version 24H2,
where it enables the ability to run Adobe Premiere Pro 25 on Arm.
Starting with Build 27744, the support is being opened to any x64
application under emulation. You may find some games or creative apps
that were blocked due to CPU requirements before will be able to run
using Prism on this build of Windows. At a technical level, the virtual
CPU used by x64 emulated applications through Prism will now have
support for additional extensions to the x86 instruction set
architecture. These extensions include AVX and AVX2, as well as BMI,
FMA, F16C, and others, that are not required to run Windows but have
become sufficiently commonplace that some apps expect them to be
present. You can see some of the new features in the output of a tool
like Coreinfo64.exe. ↫ Amanda Langowski and Brandon LeBlanc on the
Windows Blog Hopefully this makes running existing x86 applications that
don’t yet have an ARM version a more reliable affair for Windows on ARM
users.</p>

id="qnx-becomes-free-for-non-commercial-use-releases-raspberry-pi-4-image">QNX
becomes free for non-commercial use, releases Raspberry Pi 4 image</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>A long, long time ago, back when running BeOS as my main operating
system had finally become impossible, I had a short stint running QNX as
my one and only operating system. In 2004, before I joined OSNews and
became its managing editor, I also wrote and published an article about
QNX on OSNews, which is cringe-inducing to read over two decades later
(although I was only 20 when I wrote that – I should be kind to my young
self). Sadly, the included screenshots have not survived the several
transitions OSNews has gone through since 2004. Anyway, back in those
days, it was entirely possible to use QNX as a general purpose desktop
operating system, mostly because of two things. First, the incredible
Photon MicroGUI, an excellent and unique graphical environment that was
a joy to use, and two, because of a small but dedicated community of
enthousiasts, some of which QNX employees, who ported a ton of open
source applications, from basic open source tools to behemoths like
Thunderbird, the Mozilla Suite, and Firefox, to QNX. It even came with
an easy-to-use package manager and associated GUI to install all of
these applications without much hassle. Using QNX like this was a joy.
It really felt like a tightly controlled, carefully crafted user
experience, despite desktop use being so low on the priority list for
the company that it might as well have not been on there at all. Not
long after, I think a few of the people inside QNX involved with the QNX
desktop community left the company, and the entire thing just fizzled
out afterwards when the company was acquired by Harman Kardon. Not long
after, it became clear the company lost all interest, a feeling only
solidified once Blackberry acquired the company. Somewhere in between
the company released some of its code under some not-quite-open-source
license, accompanied by a rather lacklustre push to get the community
interested again. This, too, fizzled out. Well, it seems the company is
trying to reverse course, and has started courting the enthusiast
community once again. This time, it’s called QNX Everywhere, and it
involves making QNX available for non-commercial use for anyone who
wants it. No, it’s not open source, and yes, it requires some hoops to
jump through still, but it’s better than nothing. In addition, QNX also
put a bunch of open source demos, applications, frameworks, and
libraries on GitLab. One of the most welcome new efforts is a bootable
QNX image for the Raspberry Pi 4 (and only the 4, sadly, which I don’t
own). It comes with a basic set of demo application you can run from the
command line, including a graphical web browser, but sadly, it does not
seem to come with Photon microGUI or any modern equivalent. I’m guessing
Photon hasn’t seen a ton of work since its golden days two decades ago,
which might explain why it’s not here. There’s also a list of current
open source ports, which includes chunks of toolkits like GTK and Qt,
and a whole bunch of other stuff. Honestly, as cool as this is, it seems
it’s mostly aimed at embedded developers instead of weird people who
want to use QNX as a general purpose operating system, which makes total
sense from QNX’ perspective. I hope Photon microGUI will make a return
at some point, and it would be awesome – but I expect unlikely – if QNX
could be released as open source, so that it would be more likely a
community of enthusiasts could spring up around it. For now, without
much for a non-developer like me to do with it, it’s not making me run
out to buy a Raspberry Pi 4 just yet.</p>

fans evade Apple’s DRM to preserve 54 lost clickwheel-era games</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-06, from: OS News</p>
<p>Old-school Apple fans probably remember a time, just before the
iPhone became a massive gaming platform in its own right, when Apple
released a wide range of games designed for late-model clickwheel iPods.
While those clickwheel-controlled titles didn’t exactly set the gaming
world on fire, they represent an important historical stepping stone in
Apple’s long journey through the game industry. Today, though, these
clickwheel iPod games are on the verge of becoming lost media—impossible
to buy or redownload from iTunes and protected on existing devices by
incredibly strong Apple DRM. Now, the classic iPod community is engaged
in a quest to preserve these games in a way that will let enthusiasts
enjoy these titles on real hardware for years to come. ↫ Kyle Orland at
Ars Technica A nice effort, of course, and I’m glad someone is putting
time and energy into preserving these games and making them accessible
to a wider audience. As is usual with Apple, these small games were
heavily encumbered with DRM, being locked to both the the original
iTunes account that bought them, but also to the specific hardware
identifier of the iPod they were initially synchronised to using iTunes.
A clever way around this DRM exists, and it involves collectors and
enthusiasts creating reauthorising their iTunes accounts to the same
iTunes installation, and thus adding their respective iPod games to that
single iTunes installation. Any other iPods can then be synced to that
master account. The iPod Clickwheel Games Preservation Project takes
this approach to the next level, by setting up a Windows virtual machine
with iTunes installed in it, which can then be shared freely around the
web for people to the games to their collection. This is a rather
remarkably clever method of ensuring these games remain accessible, but
obviously does require knowledge of setting up Qemu and USB passthrough.
I personally never owned an iPod – I was a MiniDisc fanatic until my
Android phone took over the role of music player – so I also had no clue
these games even existed. I assume most of them weren’t exactly great to
control with the limited input method of the iPod, but that doesn’t mean
there won’t be huge numbers of people who have fond memories of playing
these games when they were younger – and thus, they are worth
preserving. We can only hope that one day, someone will create a virtual
machine that can run the actual iPod operating system, called Pixo
OS.</p>

<h2 id="windows-server-iot-2025-released">Windows Server IoT 2025
released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>Today, Microsoft announced the general availability of Windows Server
IoT 2025. This new release includes several improvements, including
advanced multilayer security, hybrid cloud agility, AI, performance
enhancements, and more. Microsoft claims that Windows Server IoT 2025
will be able to handle the most demanding workloads, including AI and
machine learning. It now has built-in support for GPU partitioning and
the ability to process large datasets across distributed environments.
With Live Migration and High Availability, it also offers a
high-performance platform for both traditional applications and advanced
AI workloads. ↫ Pradeep Viswanathan at Neowin Windows Server IoT 2025
brings the same benefits, new features, and improvements as the
just-released regular Windows Server 2025. I must admit I’m a little
unclear as to what Windows Server IoT has to offer over the regular
edition, and reading the various Microsoft marketing materials and
documents don’t really make it any clearer for me either, since I’m not
particularly well-versed in all that enterprise networking lingo.</p>

the portable, lightweight, and robust UNIX-like operating system</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-04, from: OS News</p>
<p>NetBSD is an open-source, Unix-like operating system known for its
portability, lightweight design, and robustness across a wide array of
hardware platforms. Initially released in 1993, NetBSD was one of the
first open-source operating systems based on the Berkeley Software
Distribution (BSD) lineage, alongside FreeBSD and OpenBSD. NetBSD’s
development has been led by a collaborative community and is
particularly recognized for its “clean” and well-documented codebase, a
factor that has made it a popular choice among users interested in
systems programming and cross-platform compatibility. ↫ André Machado
I’m not really sure what to make of this article, since it mostly reads
like an advertisement for NetBSD, but considering NetBSD is one of the
lesser-talked about variants of an operating system family that already
sadly plays second fiddle to the Linux behemoth, I don’t think giving it
some additional attention is really hurting anybody. The article is
still gives a solid overview of the history and strengths of NetBSD,
which makes it a good introduction. I have personally never tried
NetBSD, but it’s on my list of systems to try out on my PA-RISC
workstation since from what I’ve heard it’s the only BSD which can
possibly load up X11 on the Visualize FX10pro graphics card it has
(OpenBSD can only boot to a console on this GPU). While I could probably
coax some cobbled-together Linux installation into booting X11 on it,
where’s the fun in that? Do any of you lovely readers use NetBSD for
anything? FreeBSD and even OpenBSD are quite well represented as general
purpose operating systems in the kinds of circles we all frequent, but I
rarely hear about people using NetBSD other than explicitly because it
supports some outdated, arcane architecture in 2024.</p>

runs on RISC-V, boots to GUI login on Raspberry Pi 4</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-04, from: OS News</p>
<p>Another month lies behind us, so another monthly update from Redox is
upon us. The biggest piece of news this time is undoubtedly that Redox
now runs on RISC-V – a major achievement. Andrey Turkin has done
extensive work on RISC-V support in the kernel, toolchain and elsewhere.
Thanks very much Andrey for the excellent work! Jeremy Soller has
incorporated RISC-V support into the toolchain and build process, has
begun some refactoring of the kernel and device drivers to better handle
all the supported architectures, and has gotten the Orbital Desktop
working when running in QEMU. ↫ Ribbon and Ron Williams That’s not all,
though. Redox on the Raspberry Pi 4 boots to the GUI login screen, but
needs more work on especially USB support to become a fully usable
target. The application store from the COSMIC desktop environment has
been ported, and as part of this effort, Redox also adopted FreeDesktop
standards to make package installation easier – and it just makes sense
to do so, with more and more of COSMIC making its way to Redox. Of
course, there’s also a slew of smaller improvements to the kernel,
various drivers including the ACPI driver, RedoxFS, Relibc, and a lot
more. The progress Redox is making is astounding, and while that’s
partly because it’s easier to make progress when there’s a lot of
low-hanging fruit as there inevitably will be in a relatively new
operating system, it’s still quite an achievement. I feel very positive
about the future of Redox, and I can’t wait until it reaches a point
where more general purpose use becomes viable.</p>

<h2 id="windows-server-2025-released">Windows Server 2025 released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-04, from: OS News</p>
<p>Microsoft has confirmed the general availability of Windows Server
2025, which, as a long-term servicing channel (LTSC) release, will be
supported for almost ten years. This article describes some of the
newest developments in Windows Server 2025, which boasts advanced
features that improve security, performance, and flexibility. With
faster storage options and the ability to integrate with hybrid cloud
environments, managing your infrastructure is now more streamlined.
Windows Server 2025 builds on the strong foundation of its predecessor
while introducing a range of innovative enhancements to adapt to your
needs. ↫ What’s new in Windows Server 2025 article It should come as no
surprise that Windows Server 2025 comes loaded with a ton of new
features and improvements. I already covered some of those, such as
DTrace by default, NVMe and storage improvements, hotpatching, and more.
Other new features we haven’t discussed yet are a massive list of
changes and improvements to Active Directory, a feature-on-demand
feature for Azure Arc, support for Bluetooth keyboards, mice, and other
peripherals, and tons of Hyper-V improvements. SMB is also seeing so
many improvements it’s hard to pick just a few to highlight, and
software-defined networking is also touted as a major aspect of Server
2025. With SDN you can separate the network control plane from the data
plane, giving administrators more flexibility in managing their network.
I can just keep going listing all of the changes, but you get the idea –
there’s a lot here. You can try Windows Server 2025 for free for 180
days, as a VM in Azure, a local virtual machine image, or installed
locally through an ISO image.</p>

project from C to the Odin language</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-04, from: OS News</p>
<p>Some months ago, I got really fed up with C. Like, I don’t hate C.
Hating programming languages is silly. But it was way too much effort to
do simple things like lists/hashmaps and other simple data structures
and such. I decided to try this language called Odin, which is one of
these “Better C” languages. And I ended up liking it so much that I
moved my game Artificial Rage from C to Odin. Since Odin has support for
Raylib too (like everything really), it was very easy to move things
around. Here’s how it all went.. Well, what I remember the very least. ↫
Akseli Lahtinen You programmers might’ve thought you escaped the wrath
of Monday on OSNews, but after putting the IT administrators to work in
my previous post, it’s now time for you to get to work. If you have a C
codebase and want to move it to something else, in this case Odin,
Lahtinen’s article will send you on your way. As someone who barely
knows how to write HTML, it’s difficult for me to say anything
meaningful about the technical details, but I feel like there’s a lot of
useful, first-hand info here.</p>

<p>date: 2024-11-04, from: OS News</p>
<p>It’s the start of the work week, so for the IT administrators among
us, I have another great article by friend of the website, Stefano
Marinelli. This article covers migrating a Proxmox-based setup to
FreeBSD with bhyve. The load is not particularly high, and the machines
have good performance. Suddenly, however, I received a notification: one
of the NVMe drives died abruptly, and the server rebooted. ZFS did its
job, and everything remained sufficiently secure, but since it’s a
leased server and already several years old, I spoke with the client and
proposed getting more recent hardware and redoing the setup based on
a FreeBSD host. ↫ Stefano Marinelli If you’re interested in moving one
of your own setups, or one of your clients’ setups, from Linux to
FreeBSD, this is a great place to start and get some ideas, tips, and
tricks. Like I said, it’s Monday, and you need to get to work.</p>

fundraising goal reached in less than a week</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>It’s been less than a week, and late Friday night we reached the
fundraiser goal of €2500 (it sat at 102% when I closed it) on Ko-Fi! I’m
incredibly grateful for each and every donation, big or small, and every
new Patreon that joined our ranks. It’s incredible how many of you are
willing to support OSNews to keep it going, and it means the absolute
world to me. Hopefully we’ll eventually reach a point where monthly
Patreon income is high enough so we can turn off ads for everyone, and
be fully free from any outside dependencies. Of course, it’s not just
those that choose to support us financially – every reader matters, and
I’m very thankful for each and every one of you, donor/Patreon or not.
The weekend’s almost over, so back to regular posting business tomorrow.
I wish y’all an awesome Sunday evening.</p>

<h4>
Turns out it's perfectly legal to waste applicants' time, use posts to
squeeze more productivity out of employees
</h4>
<p>
If you didn't hear back about that great-looking tech position you
applied for, it might not be because there were too many applicants
scrambling to find a job amid rolling layoffs. There's a distinct
possibility the posting was fake to begin with.…
