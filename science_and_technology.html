will push Google to sell Chrome to break search monopoly</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-18, from: OS News</p>
<p>Speaking of Google, the United States Department of Justice is
pushing for Google to sell off Chrome. Top Justice Department antitrust
officials have decided to ask a judge to force Alphabet Inc.’s Google to
sell off its Chrome browser in what would be a historic crackdown on one
of the biggest tech companies in the world. The department will ask the
judge, who ruled in August that Google illegally monopolized the search
market, to require measures related to artificial intelligence and its
Android smartphone operating system, according to people familiar with
the plans. ↫ Leah Nylen and Josh Sisco Let’s take a look at the history
and current state of independent browsers, shall we? Netscape is
obviously dead, Firefox is hanging on by a thread (which is
inconspicuously shaped like a giant sack of money from Google), Opera is
dead (its shady Chrome skin doesn’t count), Brave is cryptotrash run by
a homophobe, and Vivaldi, while an actually good and capable Chrome skin
with a ton of fun features, still isn’t profitable, so who knows how
long they’ll last. As an independent company, Chrome wouldn’t survive.
It seems the DoJ understands this, too, because they’re clearly using
the words “sell off”, which would indicate selling Chrome to someone
else instead of just spinning it off into a separate company. But who
has both the cash and the interest in buying Chrome, without also being
a terrible tech company with terrible business incentives that might
make Chrome even more terrible than it already is? Through Chrome,
Google has sucked all the air out of whatever was left of the browser
market back when they first announced the browser. An independent Chrome
won’t survive, and Chrome in anyone else’s hands might have the
potential to be even worse. A final option out of left field would be
turning Chrome and Chromium into a truly independent foundation or
something, without a profit motive, focused solely on developing the
Chromium engine, but that, too, would be easily abused by financial
interests. I think the most likely outcome is one none of us want:
absolutely nothing will happen. There’s a new administration coming to
Washington, and if the recent proposed picks for government positions
are anything to go by, America will be incredibly lucky if they get
someone smarter than a disemboweled frog on a stick to run the DoJ. More
likely than not, Google’s lawyers will walk all over whatever’s left of
the DoJ after 20 January, or Pichai will simply kiss some more gaudy
gold rings to make the case go away.</p>

id="google-is-reportedly-killing-chrome-os-in-favour-of-android">Google
is reportedly killing Chrome OS in favour of Android</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-18, from: OS News</p>
<p>Mishaal Rahman, who has a history of being right about Google and
Android-related matters, is reporting that Google is intending to
standardise its consumer operating system efforts onto a single
platform: Android. To better compete with the iPad as well as manage
engineering resources more effectively, Google wants to unify its
operating system efforts. Instead of merging Android and Chrome OS into
a new operating system like rumors suggested in the past, however, a
source told me that Google is instead working on fully migrating Chrome
OS over to Android. While we don’t know what this means for the Chrome
OS or Chromebook brands, we did hear that Google wants future
“Chromebooks” to ship with the Android OS in the future. That’s why I
believe that Google’s rumored new Pixel Laptop will run a new version of
desktop Android as opposed to the Chrome OS that you’re likely familiar
with. ↫ Mishaal Rahman at Android Authority The fact both Chrome OS and
Android exist, and are competing with each other in some segments – most
notably tablets – hasn’t done either operating system any favours. I
doubt many people even know Chrome OS tablets are a thing, and I doubt
many people would say Android tablets are an objectively better choice
than an iPad. I personally definitely prefer Android on tablets over iOS
on tablets, but I fully recognise that for 95% of tablet buyers, the
iPad is the better, and often also more affordable, choice. Google has
been struggling with Android on tablets for about as long as they’ve
existed, and now it seems that the company is going to focus all of its
efforts on just Android, leaving Chrome OS to slowly be consumed and
replaced by it. In June, Google already announced it was going to
replace both the kernel and several subsystems in Chrome OS with their
Android counterparts, and now they’re also building a new version of
Chrome for Android with extensions supports – to match Chrome on Chrome
OS – as well as a terminal application for Android that gives access to
a local Linux virtual machine, much like is available on Chrome OS. As
mentioned, laptops running Android will also be making an entrance,
including a Pixel laptop straight from Google. The next big update for
Android 15 contains a ton of new proper windowing features, and there’s
more coming: improved keyboard and mouse support, as well as external
monitors, virtual desktops, and a lot more. As anyone who has ever
attempted to run Android on a desktop or laptop knows, there’s
definitely a ton of work Google needs to do to make Android palatable to
consumers on that front. Of course, this being Google, any of these
rumours or plans could change at any time without any sense of logic
behind it, as managers fulfill their quotas, get promoted, or leave the
company.</p>

id="ios-18.1-will-reboot-iphones-to-a-locked-state-after-72-hours-of-inactivity">iOS
18.1 will reboot iPhones to a locked state after 72 hours of
inactivity</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-18, from: OS News</p>
<p>In recent weeks, law enforcement in the United States discovered, to
their dismay, that iPhones were automatically rebooting themselves after
a few days of inactivity, thereby denying them access to the contents of
these phones. After a lot of speculation online, Jiska Classen dove into
this story to find out what was going on, and through
reverse-engineering they discovered that this was a new security feature
built by Apple as part of iOS 18.1, to further make stolen iPhones
useless for both thieves as well as law enforcement officers. It’s a
rather clever feature. The Secure Enclave Processor inside the iPhone
keeps track of when the phone was last unlocked, and if that period
exceeds 72 hours, the SEP will inform a kernel module. This kernel
module will then, in turn, tell the phone to gracefully reboot, meaning
no data is lost in this process. If the phone for whatever reason does
not reboot and remains powered on, the module will assume the phone’s
been tampered with somehow and kernel-panic. Interestingly, if the
reboot takes place properly, an analytics report stating how long the
phone was not unlocked will be sent to Apple. The reason this is such a
powerful feature is that a locked iPhone is entirely useless to anyone
who doesn’t have the right code or biometrics to unlock it. Everything
on the device is encrypted, and only properly unlocking it will decrypt
the phone’s contents; in fact, a locked phone can’t even join a Wi-Fi
network, because the stored passwords are encrypted (and I’m assuming
that a locked phone does not provide access to any methods of joining an
open network either). When you have a SIM card without any pincode, the
iPhone will connect to the cellular network, but any notifications or
calls coming in will effectively be empty, since incoming phone numbers
can’t be linked to any of the still-encrypted contacts, and while the
phone can tell it’s received notifications, it can’t show you any of
their contents. A thief who’s now holding this phone can’t do much with
it if it locks itself like this after a few days, and law enforcement
won’t be able to access the phone either. This is a big deal in places
where arrests based purely on skin colour or ethnicity or whatever are
common, like in the United States (and in Europe too, just to a far
lesser degree), or in places where people have to fear the authorities
for other reasons, like in totalitarian dictatorships like Russia, China
or Iran, where any hint of dissent can end you in harsh prisons. Apple
is always at the forefront with features such as these, with Google and
Android drunkenly stumbling into the open door a year later with copies
that take ages to propagate through the Android user base. I’m
legitimately thankful for Apple raising awareness of the need of
features such as these – even if they’re too cowardly to enable them in
places like China – as it’s quite clear a lot more people need to start
caring about these things, with recent developments and all.</p>

id="migrating-windows-vms-from-proxmox-bioskvm-to-freebsd-uefibhyve">Migrating
Windows VMs from Proxmox BIOS/KVM to FreeBSD UEFI/Bhyve</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-18, from: OS News</p>
<p>Another excellent guide from friend of the website Stefano Marinelli.
A client of mine has several Windows Server VMs, which I had not
migrated to FreeBSD/bhyve until a few weeks ago. These VMs were
originally installed with the traditional BIOS boot mode, not UEFI, on
Proxmox. Fortunately, their virtual disks are on ZFS, which allowed me
to test and achieve the final result in just a few steps. This is
because Windows VMs (server or otherwise) often installed on KVM
(Proxmox, etc.), especially older ones, are non-UEFI, using the
traditional BIOS boot mode. bhyve doesn’t support this setup, but
Windows allows changing the boot mode, and I could perform the migration
directly on the target FreeBSD server. ↫ Stefano Marinelli I link to
guides like these because finding such detailed guides born out of
experience, written by actual humans with actual experience – instead of
bots on content farms – is remarkably hard. There’s more than enough
similar content like this out there covering Windows or popular Linux
distributions like Red Hat, but the BSDs tend to fall a bit short here.
As such, promoting people writing such content is something I’ll happily
do. Marinelli also happens to host the Matrix server (as part of his BSD
Cafe effort) that houses the OSNews Matrix room, accessible by becoming
an OSNews Patreon.</p>

<h2 id="linux-6.12-released">Linux 6.12 released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-18, from: OS News</p>
<p>Version 6.12 of the Linux kernel has been released. The main feature
consists of the merger of the real-time PREEMPT_RT scheduler, most
likely one of the longest-running merger sagas in Linux’ history. This
means that Linux now fully supports both soft and hard real-time
capabilities natively, which is a major step forward for the platform,
especially when looking at embedded development. It’s now no longer
needed to draw in real-time support from outside the kernel. Linux 6.12
also brings a huge number of improvements for graphics drivers, for both
Intel and AMD’s graphics cards. With 6.12, Linux now supports the Intel
Xe2 integrated GPU as well as Intel’s upcoming discrete “Battlemage”
GPUs by default, and it contains more AMD RDNA4 support for those
upcoming GPUs. DRM panics messages in 6.12 will show a QR code you can
scan for more information, a feature written in Rust, and initial
support for the Raspberry Pi 5 finally hit mainline too. Of course,
there’s a lot more in here, like the usual LoongArch and ARM
improvements, new drivers, and so on. and if you’re a regular Linux user
you’ll see 6.12 make it to your distribution within a few weeks or
months.</p>

A study in the US has found that readers can't tell the difference
between poems written by famous poets and those written by AI aping
their style. To make matters worse – for anyone fostering a love of
literature at least – research subjects tend to like AI poetry more than
they do verse from human poets.…

<h2 id="free-towns-os-an-open-source-recreation-of-fm-towns-os">Free
Towns OS: an open source recreation of FM Towns OS</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>A few weeks ago I linked to a story by Misty De Meo, in which they
explored what happened to the various eccentric Japanese PC platforms.
One of the platforms mentioned was FM Towns, made by Fujitsu, which came
with its own graphical operating system from the era of Windows 3.x. I
had never heard of this one before, but it looks incredibly interesting,
with some unique UI ideas I’d love to explore, if only I could read
Japanese. Since learning Japanese is a serious life-long commitment, I
can safely say that’s not going to happen. It seems I’m not the only one
interested in FM Towns, as a new project called Free Towns OS (or
Tsugaru OS in Japanese) aims to provide an open source replacement for
the Free Towns operating system. The goal of this project is to write a
copyright-free FM Towns OS to run free games and the re-released games,
or why not a brand-new game for FM Towns. without concerns of violating
copyrights of the files included in the original Towns OS. Let’s see how
far we can go! But, so far so good. Now Tsugaru OS is capable of running
the three probably the most popular free games, Panic Ball 2, VSGP, and
Sky Duel. All playable without single file from the original Towns OS. ↫
Free Towns OS GitHub page That’s a pretty good milestone already. The
project aims to eventually also be able to run on real hardware instead
of just emulators, but further than that, it’s difficult for me to
extract more information from the descriptions since not every paragraph
has been translated to English just yet. Finding English information on
FM Towns OS in general is hard, so I’m also not entirely sure just how
much the project has already been able to recreate. I definitely hope
this effort attracts more interest, hopefully also from outside of Japan
so we can get a translated version people outside of Japan can use.</p>

<h2 id="microsoft-finally-publishes-iso-for-windows-on-arm">Microsoft
finally publishes ISO for Windows on ARM</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>This option is for users that want to create a Windows 11 on Arm
virtual machine on supported hardware using an ISO file or to install
Windows 11 on Arm directly without a DVD or USB flash drive.  The ISO
file can also be used to manually create bootable installation media
(USB flash drive) to install Windows 11 on Arm, but it may be necessary
to include drivers from the device manufacturer for the installation
media to be successfully bootable. This download is a multi-edition ISO
which uses your product key to unlock the correct edition. ↫ Windows on
ARM ISO download Oddly enough, up until now, Microsoft hadn’t published
a Windows 11 on ARM ISO yet. With this new ISO, ARM users can do a fresh
install, and create Windows on ARM virtual machines. Not the biggest
news in the world, but it’s a little bit surprising it’s taken them this
long to publish this ISO file.</p>
