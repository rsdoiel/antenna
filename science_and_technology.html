<h2 id="iconography-of-the-putty-tools">Iconography of the PuTTY
tools</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-13, from: OS News</p>
<p>Ah, PuTTY. Good old reliable PuTTY. This little tool is one of those
cornerstone applications in the toolbox of most of us, without any fuss,
without any upsells or anti-user nonsense – it just does its job, and it
has been doing its job for 30 years. Have you ever wondered, though,
where PuTTY’s icons come from, how they were made, and how they evolved
over time? PuTTY’s icon designs date from the late 1990s and early
2000s. They’ve never had a major stylistic redesign, but over the years,
the icons have had to be re-rendered under various constraints, which
made for a technical challenge as well. ↫ Simon Tatham The icons have
basically not changed since the late ’90s, and I think that’s incredibly
fitting for the kind of tool PuTTY is. It turns out people actually
offer to redesign all the icons in a modern style, but that’s not going
to happen. People sometimes object to the entire 1990s styling, and
volunteer to design us a complete set of replacements in a different
style. We’ve never liked any of them enough to adopt them. I think
that’s probably because the 1990s styling is part of what makes PuTTY
what it is – “reassuringly old-fashioned”. I don’t know if there’s any
major redesign that we’d really be on board with. ↫ Simon Tatham
Amen.</p>

to replace classic coreutils and more with new Rust-based
alternatives</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-12, from: OS News</p>
<p>After so much terrible tech politics news, let’s focus on some nice,
easy-going Linux news that’s not going to be controversial at all:
Ubuntu intends to replace numerous core Linux utilities with newer Rust
replacements, starting with the ubiquitous GNU Coreutils. This package
provides utilities which have become synonymous with Linux to many – the
likes of ls, cp, and mv. In recent years, there has been an effort to
reimplement this suite of tools in Rust, with the goal of reaching 100%
compatibility with the existing tools. Similar projects, like sudo-rs,
aim to replace key security-critical utilities with more modern,
memory-safe alternatives. Starting with Ubuntu 25.10, my goal is to
adopt some of these modern implementations as the default. My immediate
goal is to make uutils’ coreutils implementation the default in Ubuntu
25.10, and subsequently in our next Long Term Support (LTS) release,
Ubuntu 26.04 LTS, if the conditions are right. ↫ Jon Seager Obviously,
this is a massive change for Ubuntu, and while performance is one of the
cited reasons for undertaking this effort, the biggest reason is, of
course, security. To aid in the testing effort, Seager created a tool
called oxidizr, with which you can swap between the classic versions and
the new Rust versions of various tools to try them out in a
non-destructive way. This is a massive vote of confidence in uutils, and
I’m curious to see if it works out for Ubuntu. I doubt it’s going to
take long before other prominent distributions follow suit.</p>

id="chimera-linux-drops-risc-v-support-because-capable-risc-v-hardware-doesnt-exist">Chimera
Linux drops RISC-V support because capable RISC-V hardware doesn’t
exist</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-12, from: OS News</p>
<p>We’ve talked about Chimera Linux a few times now on OSNews, so I
won’t be repeating what makes it unique once more. The project announced
today that it will be shuttering its RISC-V architecture support, and
considering RISC-V has been supported by Chimera Linux pretty much since
the beginning, this is a big step. The reason is as sad as it is
predictable: there’s simply no RISC-V hardware out there fit for the
purpose of building a Linux distribution and all of its packages. Up
until this point, Chimera Linux built its RISC-V variant “on an x86_64
machine with qemu-user binfmt emulation coupled with transparent cbuild
support”. There are various problems with this setup, like serious
reliability problems, not being able to test packages, and a lack of
performance. The setup was intended to be a temporary solution until
proper, performanct RISC-V hardware became available, but this simply
hasn’t happened, and it doesn’t seem like this is going to change soon.
Most of the existing RISC-V hardware options simply lack the performance
to be used as build machines (think Raspberry Pi 3/4 levels of
performance), making them even slower than the emulation setup they’re
currently using. The only machine that in theory would be performant
enough to serve as a build machine is the Milk-V Pioneer, but this
machine has serious other problems, as the project notes: Milk-V Pioneer
is a board with 64 out-of-order cores; it is the only of its kind, with
the cores being supposedly similar to something like ARM Cortex-A72.
This would be enough in theory, however these boards are hard to get
here (especially with Sophgon having some trouble, new US sanctions, and
Mouser pulling all the Milk-V products) and from the information that is
available to me, it is rather unstable, receives very little support,
and is ridden with various hardware problems. ↫ Chimera Linux website
So, not only is the Milk-V Pioneer difficult to get due to, among other
things, US sanctions, it’s also not very stable and receives very little
support. Aside from the Pioneer and the various slow and therefore
unsuitable options, there’s nothing else in the pipeline either for
performant RISC-V hardware, making it quite difficult to support the
architecture. Of course, this could always change in the future, but for
now, supporting RISC-V is clearly not an option for Chimera Linux. This
is clearly sad news, especially for those of us hoping RISC-V becomes an
open source hardware platform that we can use every day, and I wonder
how many other projects are dealing with the same problem.</p>

id="i-feel-utter-anger-from-canada-to-europe-a-movement-to-boycott-us-goods-is-spreading">‘I
feel utter anger’: from Canada to Europe, a movement to boycott US goods
is spreading</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-12, from: OS News</p>
<p>In Canada, where the American national anthem has been booed during
hockey matches with US teams, a slew of apps has emerged with names such
as “buy beaver”, “maple scan” and “is this Canadian” to allow shoppers
to scan QR barcodes and reject US produce from alcohol to pizza
toppings. In Sweden, more than 70,000 users have joined a Facebook group
calling for a boycott of US companies – ironically including Facebook
itself – which features alternatives to US consumer products. In
Denmark, where there has been widespread anger over Trump’s threat to
bring the autonomous territory of Greenland under US control, the
largest grocery company, the Salling group, has said it will tag
European-made goods with a black star to allow consumers to choose them
over products made in the US. ↫ Peter Beaumont at the Guardian These are
just a few of the examples of a growing interest in places like Canada
and Europe to boycott American products to the best of one’s ability.
It’s impossible to boycott everything coming from a certain country –
good luck finding a computer without American software and/or hardware,
for instance – but these small acts of disapproval and resistance allow
people to vent their anger. It’s clearly already having an effect on
Tesla, whose sales have completely collapsed in Europe, so much so that
the president of the United States has to do his best Billy Mays
impression in front of the White House to help his buddy sell cars. Very
classy. With the United States threatening war on Canada, Greenland and
Denmark, and Panama, it’s only natural for citizens of those countries,
as well as those of close friends of those countries, to want do
something, and being more mindful or what you spend your money on is a
tried and true way to do that. Technology can definitely help here, as
we’ve talked about before, and as shown in the linked article. While no
tool to determine place of origin of products will ever be perfect, it
can certainly help to avoid products you don’t want to buy. I can only
hope this doesn’t get even more out of hand than it already has. The
United States started a trade war with the European Union today as well,
and of course, the EU retaliated. I doubt the average person has any
clue just how intertwined the global economy and supply chains are, and
that the only people paying for this are people like you and I. The tech
billionaires and career politicians won’t be the ones screwed over by
surging prices of basic necessities because of tariffs, and it won’t be
the children of the rich and powerful being sent to war with Canada or
Panama or whatever. The very companies that OSNews has reported on for
almost 30 years are the ones pushing and enabling most of this vile
nonsense, so yes, you will be seeing items about this here, whether you
and I like it or not. Only cowards and the privileged have the luxury of
ignoring what the United States is doing right now.</p>

execs are pushing Trump to build ‘Freedom Cities’ run by
corporations</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-12, from: OS News</p>
<p>A new lobbying group, dubbed the Freedom Cities Coalition, wants to
convince President Trump and Congress to authorize the creation of new
special development zones within the U.S. These zones would allow
wealthy investors to write their own laws and set up their own
governance structures which would be corporately controlled and wouldn’t
involve a traditional bureaucracy. The new zones could also serve as a
testbed for weird new technologies without the need for government
oversight. ↫ Lucas Ropek I mean, just in case you weren’t convinced yet
these people are utterly insane. This is the kind of nonsensical
libertarian Ayn Rand-inspired wank material dystopian fiction draws a
lot of inspiration from, and it never ever ends well for anyone
involved, especially not for the poor and lower classes inhabiting such
places, because they’re supposed to be warnings, not instruction
manuals. The fact that this insipid brand of utter stupidity is even
considered by a president of the United States in this day and age
should be all the proof you need that he and those around him have the
moral compass of the rotting carcass of Margaret Thatcher. I can’t
believe we have to tell these Silicon Valley “geniuses” that lawless
corporate towns are bad. In 2025.</p>

takeover is here</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-11, from: OS News</p>
<p>The future of the United States is no longer decided in Washington.
That ship has sailed. It’s now dictated in the bunkers, private jets,
and compounds of an ideological Silicon Valley, by billionaires and
wealth extremists intent on treating democracy as a nuisance that must
be swatted away. These men – raised on a rabid press that mythologized
their existence in their lifetimes, called them Wunderkind and treated
them as something above and beyond mere mortality – have consumed a
steady diet of libertarian and authoritarian fan fiction and conceived a
new order, designed to elevate their lofty egos at any and all cost. The
Internet was supposed to be the great equalizer. It was meant to be a
force that shattered hierarchies and gave power to ordinary people.
Instead, it enabled the wealth extraction and avarice of a cartel of
overfed, over-pampered despots who enriched themselves in the name of
innovation, bled the world to the point of near-total collapse,
intellectualized their power fetish and now view public institutions as
the final obstacles to be dismantled in their megalomanic pursuit of
More. ↫ Joan Westenberg The US has only itself to blame. Let’s hope they

<h2 id="eu-us-rift-triggers-call-for-made-in-europe-tech">EU-US rift
triggers call for made-in-Europe tech</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-11, from: OS News</p>
<p>The utter chaos in the United States and the country’s antagonistic,
erratic, and often downright hostile approach to what used to be its
allies has not gone unnoticed, and it seems it’s finally creating some
urgency in an area in which people have been fruitlessly advocating for
urgency for years: digital independence from US tech giants. Efforts to
make Europe more technologically “sovereign” have gone mainstream. The
European Commission now has its first-ever “technology sovereignty”
chief, Henna Virkkunen. Germany’s incoming ruling party, the
center-right Christian Democratic Union, called for “sovereign” tech in
its program for the February election. “Mounting friction across the
Atlantic makes it clearer than ever that Europe must control its own
technological destiny,” said Francesca Bria, an innovation professor at
University College London and former president of Italy’s National
Innovation Fund. ↫ Pieter Haeck at Politico This should’ve been a
primary concern for decades, as many have been trying to make it. Those
calls usually fell on deaf ears, as relying on Google, Microsoft,
Amazon, and other US tech giants was simply the cheapest option for EU
governments and corporations alike. However, now that the US is
suffering under a deeply dysfunctional, anti-EU regime, the chickens are
coming home to roost, and it’s dawning on European politicians and
business leaders alike that relying on US corporations that openly and
brazenly cheer on the Trump/Elon regime might’ve been a bad idea. To the
surprise of nobody with more than two brain cells. It’s going to take a
long, long time for this situation to get any better. Europe simply
doesn’t have any equivalents to the services offered by companies like
Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, and even if does, certainly not at their
scale. Building up the resources these US companies offers is going to
take a long time, and it won’t be cheap, making it hard to sell such
moves to voters and shareholders alike, both of which are not exactly
known for their long-term views on such complex matters. Still, it seems
consumers in the EU might be more receptive to messages of digital
independence from the US than ever before. Just look at how hard Tesla
is tanking all over Europe, part of which can definitely be attributed
to Europeans not wanting to buy any products from a man openly insulting
and lying about European elected officials. If this groundswell of
sentiment spreads, I can definitely see European politicians tapping
into it to sell massive investments in digital independence. Personally,
banning Twitter and Facebook from operating in the EU should be step
one, as its owners have made it very clear that illegal election
interference and nazi propaganda is something they have no issues with,
followed by massive investments in alternatives to the services offered
by the US big tech companies. China has been doing this for a long time
now, and Europe should follow in its footsteps. There are enough bases
to work from – from open source non-Google Android smartphones to
EU-based Linux distributions for everything from desktops to server
farms, and countless other open source services – so it’s not like we
have to start from nothing. If we can spend €800 billion to finally get
EU defense up to snuff, we should be able to spare something for digital
independence, too.</p>

<p>date: 2025-03-11, from: OS News</p>
<p>To meet those goals, we’ve begun work on a native port of the
TypeScript compiler and tools. The native implementation will
drastically improve editor startup, reduce most build times by 10x, and
substantially reduce memory usage. By porting the current codebase, we
expect to be able to preview a native implementation of tsc capable of
command-line typechecking by mid-2025, with a feature-complete solution
for project builds and a language service by the end of the year. ↫
Anders Hejlsberg It seems Microsoft is porting TypeScript to Go, and
WILL eventually offer both “TypeScript (JS)” and “TypeScript (native)”
alongside one another during a transition period. TypeScript 6.x will be
the JavaScript-based one and will continue to be developed until
TypeScript 7.0, the Go-one, is mature enough. During the 6.x release
cycle, however, there will be breaking changes and deprecations in
preparation for 7.0. Those are some serious performance improvements,
but I’m sure quite a few projects are going to run into issues during
the transition period. I hope for them that the 6.x branch remains
maintained for long enough to reasonably get everyone on board the new
Go version.</p>

the (discontinued) hybrid Debian GNU/kFreeBSD distribution</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>For decades, Linux and BSD have stood as two dominant yet
fundamentally different branches of the Unix-like operating system
world. While Linux distributions, such as Debian, Ubuntu, and Fedora,
have grown to dominate the open-source ecosystem, BSD-based systems like
FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and NetBSD have remained the preferred choice for
those seeking security, performance, and licensing flexibility. But what
if you could combine the best of both worlds—Debian’s vast package
ecosystem with FreeBSD’s robust and efficient kernel? Enter Debian
GNU/kFreeBSD, a unique experiment that merges Debian’s familiar userland
with the FreeBSD kernel, offering a hybrid system that takes advantage
of FreeBSD’s technical prowess while maintaining the ease of use
associated with Debian. This article dives into the world of Debian
GNU/kFreeBSD, exploring its architecture, installation, benefits,
challenges, and real-world applications. ↫ George Whittaker More of a
list of upsides and downsides than an actual in-depth article, but that
doesn’t make it any less interesting. There’s a variety of attempts out
there to somehow marry the Linux and BSD worlds, and each of them takes
a unique approach. I’m not sure the Debian userland with a FreeBSD
kernel is the way to go, though, and it seems I’m not alone – Debian
GNU/kFreeBSD was officially dropped from Debian in 2015 or so, and after
a flurry of unofficial activity in 2019, it was discontinued completely
in 2023 due to a lack of activity and developer interest. Odd that the
source article doesn’t mention that. If you’re still interested in a
combination of Linux and BSD, I’d keep an eye on Chimera Linux instead.
It’s very actively developed, focuses on portable code by supporting
many architectures, and its developers are veterans in this space. I
have my eye on Chimera Linux as my future distribution of choice.</p>

denies using firmware updates to brick printers with third-party
ink</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>Brother laser printers are popular recommendations for people seeking
a printer with none of the nonsense. By nonsense, we mean printers
suddenly bricking features, like scanning or printing, if users install
third-party cartridges. Some printer firms outright block third-party
toner and ink, despite customer blowback and lawsuits. Brother’s laser
printers have historically worked fine with non-Brother accessories. A
YouTube video posted this week, though, as well as older social media
posts, claim that Brother has gone to the dark side and degraded laser
printer functionality with third-party cartridges. Brother tells Ars
that this isn’t true. ↫ Scharon Harding at Ars Technica I find this an
incredibly interesting story. We all know the printer space is a cursed
hellhole of the very worst worst types of enshittification, but Brother
seemed like an island of relative calm in a sea of bullshit. In turn,
people are so used to printers being shit, that any problem that comes
up is automatically explained by malice, which is not entirely
unreasonable. Borther insists, though, that it does not break printers
using third-party toner or ink through firmware. Brother does make it
very clear that it is standard procedure to only perform troubleshooting
on Brother printers using ‘genuine’ Brother ink and toner, which is not
entirely unreasonable in my book. There’s no telling what kind of
effects third part cartridges – which do contain electronics – have on
the rest of the printer, and I don’t think it’s fair to expect Brother
to be able to document all of those possible issues. As long as using
third-party toner and ink cartridges doesn’t invalidate any warranties,
and as long as Brother doesn’t intentionally break printers for using
third-party toner and ink, I think Brother meets its obligations to
consumers. If you choose to use third-party ink and toner cartridges in
Brother printers, I think it’s only reasonable you remove those during
the troubleshooting process to ensure they’re not the cause of any
problems you’re experiencing.</p>
