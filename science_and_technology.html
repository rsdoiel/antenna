II at Hot Chips 2024: mainframe with a unique caching strategy</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-19, from: OS News</p>
<p>Mainframes still play a vital role in today, providing extremely high
uptime and low latency for financial transactions. Telum II is IBM’s
latest mainframe processor, and is designed unlike any other server CPU.
It only has eight cores, but runs them at a very high 5.5 GHz and feeds
them with 360 MB of on-chip cache. IBM also includes a DPU for
accelerating IO, along with an on-board AI accelerator. Telum II is
implemented on Samsung’s leading edge 5 nm process node. IBM’s
presentation has already been covered by other outlets. Therefore I’ll
focus on what I feel like is Telum (II)’s most interesting features.
DRAM latency and bandwidth limitations often mean good caching is
critical to performance, and IBM has a often deployed interesting
caching solutions. Telum II is no exception, carrying forward a virtual
L3 and virtual L4 strategy from prior IBM chips. ↫ Chester Lam at Chips
and Cheese If you’ve been keeping track, you can possibly deduce that
I’m bit of a sucker for IBM’s mainframes and big POWER machines. These
Telum II processors are absolutely wild.</p>

<h2 id="two-weeks-with-ar-glasses-and-linux-on-android">Two weeks with
AR glasses and Linux on Android</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-19, from: OS News</p>
<p>I recently learned something that blew my mind; you can run a full
desktop Linux environment on your phone. That’s a graphical environment
via X11 with real window management and compositing, Firefox comfortably
playing YouTube (including working audio), and a status bar with system
stats. It launches in less than a second and feels snappy. ↫ Hold the
Robot In and of itself, this is a neat trick most of us are probably
aware of. Running a full Linux distribution on an Android phone using
chroot is an awesome party trick, but I doubt many people take this
concept to its logical conclusion by connecting it up to a display,
keyboard, and mouse, and use it as their mobile workstation. Well, the
author of this article did, and he took it even one step further by
replacing the display part of the logical conclusion with AR glasses.
The AR glasses in question were a pair of Xreal Air 2 Pro, which put a
120Hz 1080p display in front of your eyes using Sony micro-OLED panels.
This will create the illusion of a 130″ screen with a 46° field of view,
from a pair of glasses that honestly do not feel that much more massive
than regular sunglasses or some of the thicker glasses frames some
people like. I’m honestly kind of impressed this is possible these days.
Add in a keyboard and mouse, and you’ve got a mobile workstation that
takes up very little space, especially since you’re carrying your phone
with you at all times anyway. Of course, you have to be comfortable with
using Linux – no Windows or macOS here – and the software side of the
equation requires more setup and fiddling than I thought it would, but
the end result is exactly like using a regular Linux desktop, but on
your phone and a pair of AR glasses instead of on a laptop or desktop.
If I had the cash to throw around on fun side projects like this (you
can help with that, actually, through Ko-Fi donations), I would totally
order a pair of these Xreal glasses to try this out.</p>

releases WSL as open source, announces CLI text editor to replace the
MS-DOS Editor</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-19, from: OS News</p>
<p>Today we’re very excited to announce the open-source release of the
Windows Subsystem for Linux. This is the result of a multiyear effort to
prepare for this, and a great closure to the first ever issue raised on
the Microsoft/WSL repo: Will this be Open Source? · Issue #1 ·
microsoft/WSL. That means that the code that powers WSL is now available
on GitHub at Microsoft/WSL and open sourced to the community! You can
download WSL and build it from source, add new fixes and features and
participate in WSL’s active development. ↫ Pierre Boulay at the Windows
Blogs Windows Subsystem for Linux seems like a relatively popular choice
for people who want a modern, Linux-based development environment but
are stuck using Windows. I’m happy to see Microsoft releasing it as open
source, which is no longer something to be surprised by at this point in
time. It leaves one to wonder how long it’s going to be before more
parts of Windows will be released as open source, since it could allow
Microsoft’s leadership to justify some serious job cuts. I honestly have
no idea how close to the real thing Windows Subsystem for Linux is, and
if it can actually fully replace a proper Linux installation, with all
the functionality and performance that entails. I’m no developer, have
no interest in Windows, so I’ve never actually tried it. I’d love to
hear some experiences from all of you. Aside from releasing WSL as open
source, Microsoft also released a new command-line text editor – simply
called Edit. It’s also open source, in its early stages, and is
basically the equivalent of Nano. It turns out 32bit versions of Windows
up until Windows 10 still shipped with the MS-DOS Editor, but obviously
that one needed a replacement. It already has support for multiple
documents, mouse support, and a few more basic features.</p>

how user-hostile Windows and macOS are, is it any wonder people long for
computers from the ’80s and ’90s?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-19, from: OS News</p>
<p>Every so often people yearn for a lost (1980s or so) era of ‘single
user computers’, whether these are simple personal computers or high end
things like Lisp machines and Smalltalk workstations. It’s my view that
the whole idea of a 1980s style “single user computer” is not what we
actually want and has some significant flaws in practice. ↫ Chris
Siebenmann I think the premise of this entire article is flawed, and
borders on being a strawman argument. I honestly don’t think there’s
many people out there who genuinely and seriously want to use an ’80s
home computer for all their computing tasks, but this article seems to
think that there are. Virtually every single person expressing interest
in and a desire for classic computers does so from a point of nostalgia,
as a learning experience, or as a hobby. They’re definitely not
interested in using any of those ’80s machine to do their banking or to
collaborate with their colleagues. Additionally, the problems and issues
people have with modern computing platforms is not that they are too
complex, but that they are no longer designed with the user in mind.
Windows, macOS, iOS; they’re all first and foremost designed to extract
money from you through ads, upsells, nag screens, and similar anti-user
features, and it’s those things that people are sick of. Coincidentally,
they are all things we didn’t have to deal with back in the ’80s and
’90s. In other words, remove the user-hostility from modern operating
systems, and people wouldn’t complain about them so much. Which seems
rather obvious, doesn’t it? It’s why using a Linux desktop like Fedora
is such a breath of fresh air. There’s no upsells for cloud storage or
streaming services, no restrictions on what I can and cannot install to
protect some multitrillion euro company’s revenue streams, no ads and
nag screens infesting my operating system – it’s just an operating
system waiting for me to tell it what it do, and then it does it. It’s
wild how increasingly revolutionary that’s becoming. Whenever I am
forced to interact with Windows 11 or whatever the current version of
macOS is, I feel such a profound and deep sadness for what they’ve
become, and it seems only natural to me that this sadness is fueling a
longing for back when these systems weren’t so user-hostile.</p>

<p>Tuxguitar is a quite powerful application written in a mixture of
Java / C. It is able to render a score in real time either via
Fluidsynth or via pure MIDI. The development of Tuxguitar started in
2008 on Sourceforce and after a halt in 2022, the project restarted on
Github and is still actively developed. The goal of this article is to
try to render a score via Tuxguitar, and various other applications
connected to Tuxguitar, via Jack or Pipewire-Jack. The score used
throughout this article will be The Pursuit Of Vikings by the band Amon
Amarth. It has 2 guitars, a bass and a drum track. ↫ Yann Collette at

using Linux for your audio needs, this article is a good starting

that Windows used the icons for. As with the icons in progman.exe, these
icons are mapped from executables according to the information in the
APPS.INF file. ↫ Raymond Chen These icons age like a fine wine. They’re
clear, well-designed, easy to read, and make extraordinary good use of
the limited amount of available pixels. Icons from Mac OS, BeOS, OS/2,
and a few others from the same era also look timeless, and I wish modern
