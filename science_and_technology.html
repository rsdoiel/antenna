“AI” chatbots infected by Russian state propaganda, call Hitler’s Mein
Kampf “insightful and intelligent”</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>Two for the techbro “‘AI’ cannot be biased” crowd: A Moscow-based
disinformation network named “Pravda” — the Russian word for “truth” —
is pursuing an ambitious strategy by deliberately infiltrating the
retrieved data of artificial intelligence chatbots, publishing false
claims and propaganda for the purpose of affecting the responses of AI
models on topics in the news rather than by targeting human readers,
NewsGuard has confirmed. By flooding search results and web crawlers
with pro-Kremlin falsehoods, the network is distorting how large
language models process and present news and information. The result:
Massive amounts of Russian propaganda — 3,600,000 articles in 2024 — are
now incorporated in the outputs of Western AI systems, infecting their
responses with false claims and propaganda. ↫ Dina Contini and Eric
Effron at Newsguard It turns out pretty much all of the major “AI” text
generators – OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4o, You.com’s Smart Assistant, xAI’s Grok,
Inflection’s Pi, Mistral’s le Chat, Microsoft’s Copilot, Meta AI,
Anthropic’s Claude, Google’s Gemini, and Perplexity’s answer engine –
have been heavily infected by this campaign. Lovely. From one genocidal
regime to the next – how about a nice Amazon “AI” summary of the reviews
for Hitler’s Mein Kampf? The full AI summary on Amazon says: “Customers
find the book easy to read and interesting. They appreciate the
insightful and intelligent rants. The print looks nice and is plain.
Readers describe the book as a true work of art. However, some find the
content boring and grim. Opinions vary on the suspenseful content,
historical accuracy, and value for money.” ↫ Samantha Cole at 404 Media
This summary was then picked up by Google, and dumped verbatim as
Google’s first search result. Lovely.</p>

discovers massive malvertising campaign on GitHub</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>Like the other Chrome skins, Microsoft Edge is also moving to disable
Manifest v2 extensions, restricting the effectiveness of ad blockers
like uBlock Origin. As an advertising company, Microsoft was obviously
never going to do the work to keep Manifest v2 support around in Chrome,
so this was inevitable. Blocking ads might be a necessary security
practice, but why cry over spilled user data, am I right? Anyway, today:
In early December 2024, Microsoft Threat Intelligence detected a
large-scale malvertising campaign that impacted nearly one million
devices globally in an opportunistic attack to steal information. The
attack originated from illegal streaming websites embedded with
malvertising redirectors, leading to an intermediary website where the
user was then redirected to GitHub and two other platforms. The campaign
impacted a wide range of organizations and industries, including both
consumer and enterprise devices, highlighting the indiscriminate nature
of the attack. ↫ Microsoft Threat Intelligence If only there was a type
of browser extension that prevents such malvertising attacks from being
possible in the first place, and if only support for such browser
extensions wasn’t being gutted as we speak. If only.</p>

id="made-ometer-helps-you-easily-and-quickly-avoid-american-products">Made
O’Meter helps you easily and quickly avoid American products</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-06, from: OS News</p>
<p>With the United States having started an incredibly dumb and
destructive trade war with Canada, Mexico, and most likely soon the
European Union, there’s quite a few people who want to avoid American
products. With how interconnected the global production chain and
corporate ownership structures are, it’s often difficult to determine
where products actually come from. Luckily, technology can help. There’s
online directories like Buy European Made, which lists European
companies in all kinds of markets, or European Alternatives, which
focuses on listing European alternatives to online services. As nice as
these are, they are quite manual, and require people to actively search
around, which is kind of a hassle when you’re making a quick grocery
store run. What if we could use image recognition to just take a photo
of a product’s box, and have our phone tell us where a product’s made?
That’s exactly what Made O’Meter does: take a photo of a product, wait
for a few seconds, and it’ll tell you exactly where it’s made. It’s made
in Denmark, with the goal to “support Europe, Canada &amp; friends”.
I’ve been trying it out on various products around the house, from
groceries like cereals and cookies, to tech products and clothing we
just bought that still had the tags on them. Every result turned out to
be 100% accurate, and it takes only a few seconds to analyse each photo.
It also doesn’t seem to be too fussy with the quality of the photos
themselves – it doesn’t care about hands and fingers in the frame, or
weirdly-shaped boxes that don’t fit nicely in a view finder. It’s a
website, not an app – very platform-agnostic, which is great – and I was
using it in Firefox for Android without issue. If you want to avoid
American products, Made O’Meter is a great tool to have with you the
next time you order something or run to the store.</p>

<p>date: 2025-03-06, from: OS News</p>
<p>Fuchsia is a new (non-Linux) operating system from Google, and one of
the key pieces of Fuchsia’s design is the component framework.
Components on Fuchsia have many similarities with some of the container
solutions on Linux (such as Docker): they both fetch content addressed
blobs from the network, assemble those blobs into an isolated filesystem
structure that holds all the dependencies necessary to run some piece of
software, and launch namespaced processes with that created directory as
its root. The most interesting details are where these two projects
diverge. Both have different use cases and requirements, which leads to
different strengths between the systems. This talk will largely be
focusing on where and why these two similar technologies diverge. ↫

<h2 id="google-duckduckgo-massively-expand-ai-search-results">Google,

<p>date: 2025-03-06, from: OS News</p>
<p>Clearly, online search isn’t bad enough yet, so Google is
intensifying its efforts to continue speedrunning the downfall of Google
Search. They’ve announced they’re going to show even more “AI”-generated
answers in Search results, to more people. Today, we’re sharing that
we’ve launched Gemini 2.0 for AI Overviews in the U.S. to help with
harder questions, starting with coding, advanced math and multimodal
queries, with more on the way. With Gemini 2.0’s advanced capabilities,
we provide faster and higher quality responses and show AI Overviews
more often for these types of queries. Plus, we’re rolling out to more
people: teens can now use AI Overviews, and you’ll no longer need to
sign in to get access. ↫ Robby Stein On top of this, Google is also
testing a new search mode where “AI” takes over the entire search
experience. Instead of seeing the usual list of links, the entire page
of “results” will be generated by “AI”. This feature, called “AI Mode”
is opt-in for now. You can opt-in in Labs, but you do need to be a
paying Google One AI Premium subscriber. I guess it’s only a matter of
time before this “AI Mode” will be the default on Google Search, because
it allows Google to keep its users on Google.com, and this makes it
easier to show them ads and block out competitors. We all know where
this is going. But, I hear you say, I use DuckDuckGo! I don’t have to
deal with any of this! Well, I’ve got some bad news for you, because
DuckDuckGo, too, is greatly expanding its use of “AI” in search. DDG
will provide free, anonymous access to various “AI” chatbots, deliver
more “AI”-generated search results based on more sources (but still
English-only), and more – all without needing to have an account. A few
of these features were already available in beta, and are now becoming
generally available. Props to DuckDuckGo for providing a ton of options
to turn all of this stuff off, though. They give users quite a bit of
control over how often these “AI”-generated search results appear, and
you can even turn them off completely. All the “AI” chatbot stuff is
delegated to a separate website, and any link to it from the normal
search results can be disabled, too. It’s entirely possible to have
DuckDuckGo just show a list of regular search results, exactly as it
should be. Let’s hope DDG can keep these values going, because if they,
too, start pushing this “AI” nonsense without options to turn it off, I
honestly have no idea where else to go.</p>

<h2 id="netbsd-on-a-javastation">NetBSD on a JavaStation</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-06, from: OS News</p>
<p>Back when Java was still a new programming language, Sun had the idea
of building a computer specifically designed for Java, unique processor
running byte-code as its native machine code and all. This whole
endeavour proved to be more complicated than Sun had hoped, and as such,
they eventually abandoned the idea of a Java processor in favour of
plain SPARC. When the JavaStation shipped, it was a regular SPARC
workstation without a hard drive, running something called JavaOS from
flash memory. Since JavaOS is, of course, long gone, what can you do
with JavaStation today? Well, you apparently can run NetBSD on it, but
it’s quite an ordeal. The JavaStation needs to boot from the network
using a combination of RARP, NFS, and more, and surprisingly, this
entire setup, including the computer acting as the ‘server’ for the
JavaStation, is well-documented and supported by NetBSD. Once you’ve
gone through all the steps, you’ll end up with a JavaStation running the
latest release of NetBSD, which is pretty cool. Obviously there is still
a lot to do; as you can see postfix isn’t happy, and the swapfile
security needs tightening up for a start. But we do now have a
functional NetBSD system running on a vintage network computer! ↫ Old
Fart’s Almanac NetBSD’s continued support for the most arcane of
hardware will never cease to amaze me.</p>

tools combined into a single project we’re calling zentool. The
long-term goal is to provide a suite of capabilities similar to
binutils, but targeting AMD microcode instead of CPU machine code. You
can find the project source code here along with documentation on how to
use the tools. ↫ Google’s Bug Hunters website I just read a whole bunch
of words, but I barely understand what’s going on. The general, very

Publisher will no longer be supported after October 2026</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>In October 2026, Microsoft Publisher will reach its end of life.
After that time, it will no longer be included in Microsoft 365 and
existing on-premises suites will no longer be supported. Microsoft 365
subscribers will no longer be able to open or edit Publisher files in
Publisher. Until then, support for Publisher will continue and users can
expect the same experience as today. ↫ Microsoft’s Support website
Microsoft Publisher is an application with a long history, and it’s been
part of Microsoft Office for almost 35 years. The initial 1.0 version
was released all the way back in 1991, and it’s tried to compete with
tools like InDesign and QuarkXPress in the desktop publishing market,
but it never gained much of a share. Microsoft advises users of
Publisher to use a combination of Word, PowerPoint, or Designer instead,
which, of course, are all Microsoft products too. Due to Microsoft’s
stupidly complex naming schemes and branding changes over the years, you
might assume that the quoted paragraph means Publisher will just stop
working for everyone, but that’s not the case. People who have the
regular, non-subscription version of Publisher, probably as part of
Microsoft Office, will of course be able to keep using it perpetually,
just without support. If you use Office through Microsoft 365, however,
the application will just… Stop working. Welcome to the future, I guess.
I’m curious, though – do any of you use Microsoft Publisher, at home or
at your work? I assumed the entire desktop publishing market was locked
up by things like InDesign and QuarkXPress, and I had almost forgotten
Publisher was still a thing in the first place.</p>

<p>How much faster is fastDOOM than regular Doom on a decked-out 486
from 1993? 30% faster without cutting any features! On a demanding map
like doom2’s demo1, the gain is even higher, from 16.8 fps to 24.9 fps.
That is 48% faster! I did not suspect that DOOM had left that much on
the table. Obviously shipping within one year left little time to
optimize. I had to understand how this magic trick happened. ↫ Fabien
Sanglard What follows is an incredibly detailed exploration of why,
exactly, fastDOOM is so much faster, by building and benchmarking every
version, and even going git commit by git commit to really understand
how fastDOOM’s developer, Victor “Viti95” Nieto, achieved these
impressive results.</p>

<p>These months are coming and going way too fast, for a whole variety

operating system written in Rust. I February, January’s work on dynamic
linking continued, adding support for it to the recipes for Cargo, LLVM,
Rust, libssh2, OpenSSL, zlib, COSMIC Terminal, NetSurf, libpng, bzip2,
DevilutionX, and LuaJIT, as well as to the project’s Rust and OpenSSL
forks. Relibc also saw its usual slew of improvements, as did the build
system and documentation. The Intel HD Audio driver initialization has
been fixed, and PS/2 touchpad support has been fixed as well – you’d be
surprised to find out how many laptops use PS/2 internally, so this is
an important function to maintain. And as always, there’s a whole slew
of smaller changes and fixes, too.</p>

id="google-multibillionaire-brin-demands-employees-work-60-hours-a-week-on-autocomplete-tools">Google
multibillionaire Brin demands employees work 60 hours a week on
autocomplete tools</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-04, from: OS News</p>
<p>Over the past few years, the tech industry has gone from cushy
landing pad for STEM grads to a cesspit of corporate greed, where
grueling hours are commonplace, and layoffs could strike at any moment.
Unfortunately for employees of Alphabet, the parent company of Google,
the squeeze is just getting started. ↫ Joe Wilkins at Futurism Sergey
Brin, one of the original co-founders of Google who seems to spend most
of his time not working at Google, has sent out a company-wide memo
demanding everyone working at Google puts in at least 60 hours a week,
in the office, to work on “AI” that will eventually replace the very
employees he’s demanding work 60 hours a week in the office. Mind you,
this is the same Google that has just gone through several rounds of
layoffs and made $26.3 billion in profit in a single quarter. The goal,
according to Brin, is for Google to be the first to create an
“artificial general intelligence”, you know, that thing we used to call
just “AI” until the Silicon Valley scammers got a hold of the term.
There’s no indication anyone is even remotely close to anything even
remotely related to “AGI”, and it’s highly unlikely the glorified
autocomplete they are peddling today are anything more than a very
expensive dead end to nowhere, but that’s not stopping him from working
his employees to the bone. At this point in time I feel like the big
tech companies are racing towards a cliff, blinded by huge piles of
investment money, deafened by each other’s hyperbolic claims and
promises, while clueless politicians cheer them on. All of this is going
to come crashing down in a spectacular fashion, and of course, the
billionaires at the top won’t be the one suffering the consequences. As
is tradition.</p>

id="c-creator-calls-for-help-to-defend-programming-language-from-serious-attacks">C++
creator calls for help to defend programming language from ‘serious
attacks’</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>Bjarne Stroustrup, creator of C++, has issued a call for the C++
community to defend the programming language, which has been shunned by
cybersecurity agencies and technical experts in recent years for its
memory safety shortcomings. C and C++ are built around manual memory
management, which can result in memory safety errors, such as out of
bounds reads and writes, though both languages can be written and
combined with tools and libraries to help minimize that risk. These
sorts of bugs, when they do crop up, represent the majority of
vulnerabilities in large codebases. ↫ Thomas Claburn at The Register I
mean, it makes sense to me that those responsible for new code to use
programming languages that more or less remove the most common class of
vulnerabilities. With memory-safe languages like Rust having been around
for quite a while now, it’s almost wilful negligence to write new code
where security is a priority in anything but such memory-safe languages.
Of course, this doesn’t mean you delete any and all existing code – it
just means you really need to start writing any new code in safer
languages. After all, research shows that even when you only write new
code in memory-safe languages, the reduction in vulnerabilities is
massive. This reminds me a lot of those old videos of people responding
to then-new laws mandating the use of seat belts in cars. A lot of
people didn’t want to put them on, saying things to the tune of “I don’t
need one because I’m a good driver”. Even if you are a good driver –
which statistically you aren’t – everyone else on the road isn’t. When
we see those old videos now, they feel quaint, archaic, and dumb – of
course you wear a seat belt, you’d be an irresponsible idiot not to! –
but only a few decades ago, those arguments made perfect sense to
people. It won’t be long before the same will apply to people doggedly
refusing to use memory-safe languages or libraries/extensions that
introduce such safety to existing languages, and Bjarne Stroustrup seems
to understand that. Are you really smarter than Bjarne Stroustrup?</p>

is not ending Windows 11 support for Intel’s 8th, 9th, and 10th Gen
processors</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-02, from: OS News</p>
<p>About two weeks ago, there was a bit of confusion about the system
requirements for Windows 11 24H2, because Intel’s 8th Gen, 9th Gen, and
10th Gen processors had disappeared from the list of supported hardware.
This seemed rather drastic, even by Windows 11 standards. I skipped
posting about it on OSNews because I kind of assumed it must’ve been an
error instead of actual policy, and it turns out that’s indeed the case.
A page update made on February 13, 2025 did not reflect accurate
offerings. It has since been updated, including the addition of Intel
processor models 8th, 9th, and 10th generation Intel CPUs, and the
reclassification for select Intel processor models to support Windows
11. ↫ Windows 11 version 24H2 supported Intel processors Good news for
people still stuck on the Windows 11 train.</p>

long anticipated feature is the Chromium engine version 112 in
combination with Qt 6.6.2, which brings our port of the Falkon web
browser on par with the modern web (Section Qt, WebEngine, and Falkon
browser). On the account of exploratory activities, we are happy to
report that Qemu can now be used directly on Genode (Section Qemu on
Genode). ↫ Genode release notes Another incredibly impressive set of
improvements to Genode, which will benefit Sculpt OS, too of course.
Aside from the improvements mentioned above, there’s also new support
for Intel’s Meteor Lake and embedded F&amp;S MX8MP armStone boards,
improvements to USB and audio, and much more.</p>

<h2 id="netboot-windows-11-with-iscsi-and-ipxe">Netboot Windows 11 with
iSCSI and iPXE</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-01, from: OS News</p>
<p>For the past several years my desktop has also had a disk dedicated
to maintaining a Windows install. I’d prefer to use the space in my PC
case for disks for Linux. Since I already run a home NAS, and my Windows
usage is infrequent, I wondered if I could offload the Windows install
to my NAS instead. This lead me down the course of netbooting Windows 11
and writing up these notes on how to do a simplified “modern” version. ↫
Terin Stock The setup Terin Stock ended up with is rather ingenious, to
be honest. They had to create not just an environment in which
netbooting through iXPE using iSCSI, but also a customised Windows PE
ISO that included the necessary drivers to make installing Windows onto
a iSCSI-connected remote drive possible in the first place, because
they’re not included in the Windows installation ISO. This isn’t exactly
a standard setup, of course, so there were a few roadblocks to clear
before getting there. They now have Windows 11 booting from a drive in
their NAS, and it seems it doesn’t affect gaming – the reason why they
did this in the first place is an online game that hard-requires Windows
– at all. Installing the game through Steam took a bit longer, sure, but
regular gameplay seems unaffected, and there’s no saturation on the
network or disk. You’d think this would be wholly too slow to be
suitable for gaming, but I guess at least some games handle this just
fine. My uneducated guess is that more demanding games that rely on a
ton of disk activity to load textures and so on will have a much more
difficult time running. In any event, this intrigues me, and I’m kind of
curious to try and set this up myself, if only for the memes. It looks
like fun.</p>
