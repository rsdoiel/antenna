<h2 id="what-does-append-do-in-dos">What does APPEND do in DOS?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-20, from: OS News</p>
<p>The working principle of APPEND is not complicated. It primarily
serves as a bridge between old DOS applications which have no or poor
support for directories, and users who really, really want to organize
files and programs in multiple directories and possibly across multiple
drive letters. Of course the actual APPEND implementation is anything
but straightforward. ↫ Michal Necasek Another gem of an article by
Michal Necasek, detailing a command I’ve known about almost all my life
but never once knew what it was supposed to be for. The gist is that
APPEND allows for files to be opened not only in the current working
directory, but also up to two levels deeper. This gives you a
rudimentary way of working with directories, even when using programs or
commands that have no clue what directories even are. since DOS 1.x
doesn’t support directories, but DOS 2.x does, having a tool like this
to create a bridge between the pre and post-directory worlds can be
quite useful. I’ve basically learned more about DOS from Necasek’s work
in the past few years than I learned about DOS when I was actively using
it in the early ’90s.</p>

id="t2-linux-takes-weird-architectures-seriously-including-my-beloved-pa-risc">T2
Linux takes weird architectures seriously, including my beloved
PA-RISC</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-20, from: OS News</p>
<p>With more and more Linux distributions – as well as the kernel itself
– dropping support for more exotic, often dead architectures, it’s a
blessing T2 Linux exists. This unique, source-based Linux distribution
focuses on making it as easy as possible to build a Linux installation
tailored to your needs, and supports an absolutely insane amount of
architectures and platforms. In fact, calling T2 a “distribution” does
it a bit of a disservice, since it’s much more than that. You may have
noticed the banner at the top of OSNews, and if we somehow – unlikely!
-manage to reach that goal before the two remaining new-in-box HP c8000
PA-RISC workstations on eBay are sold, my plan is indeed to run HP-UX as
my only operating system for a week, because I like inflicting pain on
myself. However, I also intend to use that machine to see just how far
T2 Linux on PA-RISC can take me, and if it can make a machine like the
c8000, which is plenty powerful with its two dual-core 1.0Ghz PA-RISC
processors, properly useful in 2024. T2 Linux 24.12 has just been
released, and it brings with it the latest versions of the Linux kernel,
gcc, LLVM/Clang, and so on. With T2 Linux, which describes itself as a
System Development Environment, it’s very easy to spin up a heavily
customised Linux installation fit for your purpose, targeting anything
from absolutely resource-starved embedded systems to big hunks of, I
don’t know, SPARC or POWER metal. If you’ve got hardware with a
processor in it, you can most likely build T2 for it. The project also
provides a large number of pre-built ISOs for a whole slew of supported
architectures, sometimes further divided into glibc or musl, so you can
quickly get started even without having to build something yourself.
It’s an utterly unique project that deserves more attention than it’s
getting, especially since it seems to be one of the last Linux
“distributions” that takes supporting weird platforms out-of-the-box
seriously. Think of it as the NetBSD of the Linux world, and I know for
a fact that there’s a very particular type of person to whom that really
appeals.</p>

<h2 id="intel-admits-it-no-longer-controls-the-direction-of-x86">Intel
admits it no longer controls the direction of x86</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-20, from: OS News</p>
<p>Remember x86S, Intel’s initiative to create a 64bit-only x86
instruction set, with the goal of removing some of the bloat that the
venerable architecture accumulated over the decades? Well, this
initiative is now dead, and more or less replaced with the x86 Ecosystem
Advisory Group, a collection of companies with a stake in keeping x86
going. Most notably, this includes Intel and AMD, but also other tech
giants like Google. In the first sign of changes to come after the
formation of a new industry group, Intel has confirmed to Tom’s
Hardware that it is no longer working on the x86S specification. The
decision comes after Intel announced the formation of the x86 Ecosystem
Advisory Group, which brings together Intel, AMD, Google, and numerous
other industry stalwarts to define the future of the x86 instruction
set. Intel originally announced its intentions to de-bloat the x86
instruction set by developing a simplified 64-bit mode-only x86S
version, publishing a draft specification in May 2023, and then updating
it to a 1.2 revision in June of this year. Now, the company says it has
officially ended that initiative. ↫ Paul Alcorn This seems like an
acknowledgement of the reality that Intel is no longer in the position
it once was when it comes to steering the direction of x86. It’s AMD
that’s doing most of the heavy-lifting for the architecture at the
moment, and it’s been doing that for a while now, with little signs
that’s going to chance. I doubt Intel had enough clout left to push
something as relatively drastic as x86S, and now has to rely on building
concensus with other companies invested in x86. It may seem like a small
thing, and I doubt many larger tech outlets will care, but this story is
definitely the biggest sign yet that Intel is in a lot more trouble than
people already seem to think based on Intel’s products and market
performance. What we have here is a full admission by Intel that they no
longer control the direction of x86, and have to rely on the rest of the
industry to help them. That’s absolutely wild.</p>

id="the-european-commissions-proposed-interoperability-measures-place-apple-under-a-form-of-guardianship">The
European Commission’s proposed interoperability measures place Apple
under a form of guardianship</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-19, from: OS News</p>
<p>What’s the European Commission to do when one of the largest
corporations in the world has not only been breaking its laws
continually, but also absolutely refuses to comply, uses poison pills in
its malicious compliance, badmouths you in the press through both
official – and unofficial – employees? Well, you start telling that
corporation exactly what it needs to do to comply, down to the most
minute implementation details, and in the process take away any form of
wiggle room. Steven Troughton-Smith, an absolute wizard when it comes to
the inner workings of Apple’s various platforms and allround awesome
person, dove into the European Commission’s proposed next steps when it
comes to dealing with Apple’s refusal to comply with EU law – the
Digital Markets Act, in particular – and it’s crystal-clear that the EC
is taking absolutely no prisoners. They’re not only telling Apple
exactly what kind of interoperability measures it must take, down to the
API level, but they’re also explicitly prohibiting Apple from playing
games through complex contracts and nebulous terms to try and make
interoperability a massive burden. As an example of just how detailed
the EC is getting with Apple, here’s what the company needs to do to
make AirDrop interoperable: Apple shall provide a protocol specification
that gives third parties all information required to integrate, access,
and control the AirDrop protocol within an application or service
(including as part of the operating system) running on a third-party
connected physical device in order to allow these applications and
services to send files to, and receive files from, an iOS device. ↫
European Commission In addition, Apple must make any new features or
changes to AirDrop available to third parties at the same time as it
releases them: For future functionalities of or updates to the AirDrop
feature, Apple shall make them available to third parties no later than
at the time they are made available to any Apple connected physical
device. ↫ European Commission These specific quotes only cover AirDrop,
but similar demands are made about things like AirPlay, the easy pairing
process currently reserved for Apple’s own accessories, and so on. I
highly suggest reading the source document, or at the very least the
excellent summary thread by Steven, to get an even better idea of what
the EC is demanding here. The changes must be made in the next major
version of iOS, or at the very latest before the end of 2025. The EC
really goes into excruciating detail about how Apple is supposed to
implement these interoperability features, and leaves very little to no
wiggle room for Apple shenanigans. The EC is also clearly fed up with
Apple’s malicious compliance and other tactics to violate the spirit of
the DMA: Apple shall not impose any restrictions on the type or use case
of the software application and connected physical device that can
access or makeuse of the features listed in this Document. Apple shall
not undermine effective interoperability with the 11 features set out in
this Document by behaviour of a technical nature. In particular, Apple
shall actively take all the necessary actions to allow effective
interoperability with these features. Apple shall not impose any
contractual or commercial restrictions that would be opaque, unfair,
unreasonable, or discriminatory towards third parties or otherwise
defeat the purpose of enabling effective interoperability. In
particular, Apple shall not restrict business users, directly or
indirectly, to make use of any interoperability solution in their
existing apps via an automatic update. ↫ European Commission What I find
most interesting about all of this is that it could have been so easily
avoided by Apple. Had Apple approached the EU and the DMA with the same
kind of respect, grace, and love Apple and Tim Cook clearly reserve for
totalitarian dictatorships like China, Apple could’ve enabled
interoperability in such a way that it would still align with most of
Apple’s interests. They would’ve avoided the endless stream of negative
press this fruitless “fight” with the EU is generating, and it would’ve
barely impacted Apple’s bottom line. Put it on one of those Apple
microsites that capture your scrolling, boast about how amazing Apple is
and how much they love interoperability, and it most likely would’ve
been a massive PR win. Instead, under the mistaken impression that this
is a business negotiation, Apple tried to cry, whine, throw tamper
tantrums, and just generally act like horrible spoiled brats just
because someone far, far more powerful than they are told them “no” for
once. Now they’ve effectively been placed under guardianship, and have
to do exactly as the European Commission tells them to, down to the API
level, without any freedom to make their own choices. The good thing is
that the EC’s journey to make iOS a better and more capable operating
system continues. We all benefit. Well, us EU citizens, anyway.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-make-an-apple-watch-work-with-android">How to make an
Apple Watch work with Android</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-18, from: OS News</p>
<p>What if you have an Android phone, but consider the Apple Watch
superior to other smartwatches? Well, you could switch to iOS, or, you
know, you could hack your way into making an Apple Watch work with
Android, like Abishek Muthian did. So I decided to make Apple Watch work
with my Android phone using open-source applications, interoperable
protocols and 3rd party services. If you just want to use my code and
techniques and not read my commentary on it then feel free to checkout
my GitHub for sources. ↫ Abishek Muthian Getting notifications to work,
so that notifications from the Android phone would show up on the Apple
Watch, was the hardest part. Muthian had to write a Python script to
read the notifications on the Android device using Termux, and then use
Pushover to send them to the Apple Watch. For things like contacts and
calendar, he relied on *DAV, which isn’t exactly difficult to set up, so
pretty much anyone who’s reading this can do that. Sadly, initial setup
of the watch did require the use of an iPhone, using the same SIM as is
in the Android phone. This way, it’s possible to set up mobile data as
well as calling, and with the SIM back in the Android phone, a call will
show up on both the Apple Watch and the Android device. Of course, this
initial setup makes the process a bit more cumbersome than just buying a
used Apple Watch off eBay or whatever, but I’m honestly surprised
everything’s working as well as it does. This goes to show that the
Apple Watch is not nearly as “deeply integrated” with the iPhone as
Apple so loves to claim, and making the Apple Watch work with Android in
a more official manner certainly doesn’t look to be as impossible as
Apple makes it out to be when dealing with antitrust regulators. Of
course, any official support would be much more involved, especially in
the testing department, but it would be absolute peanuts, financially,
for a company with Apple’s disgusting level of wealth. Anyway, if you
want to setup an Apple Watch with Android, Muthian has put the code on
GitHub.</p>

<h2 id="a-quick-look-at-os2s-built-in-virtualisation">A quick look at
OS/2’s built-in virtualisation</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-18, from: OS News</p>
<p>Most of us are aware that IBM’s OS/2 has excellent compatibility with
DOS and Windows 3.x programs, to the point where OS/2 just ships with an
entire installation of Windows 3.x built-in that you can run multiple
instances of. In fact, to this day, ArcaOS, the current incarnation of
the maintained and slightly modernised OS/2 codebase, still comes with
an entire copy of Windows 3.x, making ArcaOS one of the very best ways
to run DOS and Windows 3.x programs on a modern machine, without
resorting to VMware or VirtualBox. Peter Hofmann took a look at one of
the earlier versions of OS/2 – version 2.1 from 1993 – to see how its
DOS compatibility actually works, or more specifically, the feature “DOS
from drive A:”. You can insert a bootable DOS floppy and then
run that DOS in a new window. Since this is called “DOS from drive A:”,
surely this is something DOS-specific, right? Maybe only supports MS-DOS
or even only PC DOS? Far from it, apparently. ↫ Peter Hofmann Hofmann
wrote a little test program using nothing but BIOS system calls, meaning
it doesn’t use any DOS system calls. This “real mode BIOS program” can
run from the bootsector, if you wanted to, so after combining his test
program with a floppy disk boot record, you end up with a bootable
floppy that runs the test program, for instance in QEMU. After a bit of
work, the test program on the bootable floppy will work just fine using
OS/2’s “DOS from drive A:” feature, even though it shouldn’t. What this
seems to imply is that this functionality in OS/2 2.1 looks a lot like a
hypervisor, or as Hofmann puts it, “basically a builtin QEMU that
anybody with a 386 could use”. That’s pretty advanced for the time, and
raises a whole bunch of questions about just how much you can do with
this.</p>

<h2 id="fedora-proposes-dropping-atomic-desktops-for-ppc64le">Fedora
proposes dropping Atomic desktops for PPC64LE</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-18, from: OS News</p>
<p>Fedora is proposing to stop building their Atomic desktop versions
for PPC64LE. PopwerPC 64 LE basically comes down to IBM’s POWER
architecture, and as far as desktop use goes, that exclusively means the
POWER9 machines from Raptor Computing Systems. I reviewed their small
single-socket Blackbird machine in 2021, and I also have their
dual-socket Talos II workstation. I can tell you from experience that
nobody who owns one of these is opting for an immutable Fedora variant,
and on top of that, these machines are getting long in the tooth. Raptor
passed on POWER10 because it required proprietary firmware, so we’ve
been without new machines for years now. As such, it makes sense for
Fedora to stop building Atomic desktops for this architecture. We will
stop building the Fedora Atomic Desktops for the PowerPC 64 LE
architecture. According to the count me statistics, we don’t have any
Atomic Desktops users on PPC64LE. Users of Atomic Desktops on PPC64LE
will have to either switch back to a Fedora package mode installation or
build their own images using Bootable Containers which are available for
PPC64LE. ↫ Timothée Ravier I’ve never written much about the Talos II,
surmising that most of my Blackbird review applies to the Talos II, as
well. If there’s interest, I can check to see what the current state of
Fedora and/or other distributions on POWER9 is, and write a short review
about the experience. I honestly don’t know if there’s much interest at
this point in POWER9, but if there is, here’s your chance to get your
questions answered.</p>

id="microsoft-recall-screenshots-credit-cards-and-social-security-numbers-even-with-the-sensitive-information-filter-enabled">Microsoft
Recall screenshots credit cards and Social Security numbers, even with
the “sensitive information” filter enabled</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-16, from: OS News</p>
<p>Microsoft’s Recall feature recently made its way back to Windows
Insiders after having been pulled from test builds back in June, due to
security and privacy concerns. The new version of Recall encrypts the
screens it captures and, by default, it has a “Filter sensitive
information,” setting enabled, which is supposed to prevent it from
recording any app or website that is showing credit card numbers, social
security numbers, or other important financial / personal info. In my
tests, however, this filter only worked in some situations (on two
e-commerce sites), leaving a gaping hole in the protection it promises.
↫ Avram Piltch at Tom’s Hardware Recall might be one of the biggest own
goals I have seen in recent technology history. In fact, it’s more of a
series of own goals that just keep on coming, and I honestly have no
idea why Microsoft keeps making them, other than the fact that they’re
so high on their own “AI” supply that they just lost all touch with
reality at this point. There’s some serious Longhorn-esque tunnel vision
here, a project during which the company also kind of forgot the outside
world existed beyond the walls of Microsoft’s Redmond headquarters. It’s
clear by now that just like many other tech companies, Microsoft is so
utterly convinced it needs to shove “AI” into every corner of its
products, that it no longer seems to be asking the most important
question during product development: do people actually want this? The
response to Windows Recall has been particularly negative, yet Microsoft
keep pushing and pushing it, making all the mistakes along the way
everybody has warned them about. It’s astonishing just how dedicated
they are to a feature nobody seem to want, and everybody seems to warn
them about. It’s like we’re all Kassandra. The issue in question here is
exactly as dumb as you expect it to be. The “Filter sensitive
information” setting is so absurdly basic and dumb it basically only
seems to work on shopping sites, not anywhere else where credit card or
other sensitive information might be shown. This shortcoming is obvious
to anyone who think about what Recall does for more than one nanosecond,
but Microsoft clearly didn’t take a few moments to think about this,
because their response is to let them know through the Feedback Hub any
time Recall fails to detect and sensitive information. They’re basically
asking you, the consumer, to be the filter. Unpaid, of course. After the
damage has already been done. Wild. If you can ditch Windows, you
should. Windows is not a place of honour.</p>

id="fedoras-new-btrfs-sig-should-focus-on-making-btrfs-features-more-accessible">Fedora’s
new Btrfs SIG should focus on making Btrfs’ features more
accessible</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-16, from: OS News</p>
<p>As Michel Lind mentioned back in August, we wanted to form a Special
Interest Group to further the development and adoption of Btrfs in
Fedora. As of yesterday, the SIG is now formed. ↫ Neal Gompa Since I’ve
been using Fedora on all my machines for a while now, I’ve also been
using Btrfs as my one and only file system for just as much time,
without ever experiencing any issues. In fact, I recently ordered four
used 4TB enterprise hard drives (used, yes, but zero SMART issues) to
set up a storage pool whereto I can download my favourite YouTube
playlists so I don’t have to rely on internet connectivity and YouTube
not being shit. I combined the four drives into a single 16TB Btrfs
volume, and it’s working flawlessly. Of course, not having any
redundancy is a terrible idea, but I didn’t care much since it’s just
downloaded YouTube videos. However, it’s all working so flawlessly, and
the four drives were so cheap, I’m going to order another four drives
and turn the whole thing into a 16TB Btrfs volume using one of the Btrfs
RAID profiles for proper redundancy, even if it “costs” me half of the
32TB of total storage. This way, I can also use it as an additional
backup for more sensitive data, which is never a bad thing. The one big
downside here is that all of this has to be set up and configured using
the command line. While that makes sense in a server environment and I
had no issues doing so, I think a product that calls itself Fedora
Workstation (or, in my case, Fedora KDE, but the point stands) should
have proper graphical tools for managing the file system it uses. Fedora
should come with a graphical utility to set up, manage, and maintain
Btrfs volumes, so you don’t have to memorise a bunch of arcane commands.
I know a lot of people get very upset when you even suggest someting
like this, but that’s just elitist nonsense. Btrfs has various
incredibly useful features that should be exposed to users of all kinds,
not just sysadmins and weird nerds – and graphical tools are a great way
to do this. I don’t know exactly what the long-term plans of the new
Btrrfs SIG are going to be, but I think making the useful features of
Btrfs more accessible should definitely be on the list. You shouldn’t
need to be a CLI expert to set up resilient, redundant local storage on
your machine, especially now that the interest in digital
self-sufficiency is increasing.</p>

id="theres-a-market-out-there-for-a-modern-x11motif-based-desktop-distribution">There’s
a market out there for a modern X11/Motif-based desktop
distribution</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>EMWM is a fork of the Motif Window Manager with fixes and
enhancements. The idea behind this is to provide compatibility with
current xorg extensions and applications, without changing the way the
window manager looks and behaves. This includes support for
multi-monitor setups through Xinerama/Xrandr, UFT-8 support with Xft
fonts, and overall better compatibility with software that
requires Extended Window Manager Hints. Additionally a couple of goodies
are available in the separate utilities package: XmToolbox,
a toolchest like application launcher, which reads it’s multi-level menu
structure from a simple plain-text file ~/.toolboxrc, and XmSm, a simple
session manager that provides session configuration, locking and
shutdown/suspend options. ↫ EMWM homepage I had never heard of EMWM, but
I immediately like it. This same developer, Alexander Pampuchin, also
develops XFile, a file manager for X11 which presents the file system as
it actually is, instead of using a bunch of “imaginary” locations to
hide the truth, if you will. On top of that, they also develop XImaging,
a comprehensive image viewer for X11. All of these use the Motif widget
toolkit, focus on plain X11, and run on most Linux distributions and
BSDs. They need to be compiled by the user, most likely. I am convinced
that there is a small but sustainable audience for a modern, up-to-date
Linux distribution (although a BSD would work just as well), that
instead of offering GNOME, KDE, Xfce, or whatever, focuses instead of
delivering a traditional, yet modernised and maintained, desktop
environment and applications using not much more than X11 and Motif,
eschewing more complex stuff like GTK, Qt, systemd, Wayland, and so on.
I would use the hell out of a system that gives me a version of the
Motif-based desktops like CDE from the ’90s, but with some modern
amenities, current hardware support, support for high-resolution
displays, and so on. You can certainly grab bits and bobs left and right
from the web and build something like this from scratch, but not
everyone has the skills and time to do so, yet I think there’s enough
people out there who are craving for something like this. There’s tons
of maintained X11/Motif software out there – it’s just all spread out,
disorganised, and difficult to assemble because it almost always means
compiling it all from scratch, and most people simply don’t have the
time and energy for that. Package this up on a solid Debian, Fedora, or
FreeBSD base, and I think you’ve got quite some users lining up.</p>

<h2 id="xfce-4.20-with-experimental-wayland-support-released">Xfce 4.20
with experimental Wayland support released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>After two years of intense development, the third major Linux desktop
environment has released a new version: Xfce 4.20 is here. The major
focus of this release cycle was getting Xfce ready for Wayland, and
they’ve achieved quite a bit of that goal, but support for it is still
experimental. Thanks to Brian and Gaël almost all Xfce components are
able to run on Wayland windowing, while still keeping support for X11
windowing. This major effort was achieved by abstracting away any
X11/Wayland windowing specific calls and making use of Wayland/Wlroots
protocols. A whole new Xfce library, “libxfce4windowing” was introduced
during that process. XWayland will not be required to run any of the
ported Xfce components. ↫ Xfce development team A major gap in Xfce’s
Wayland support is the fact that Xfwm4 has not been ported to Wayland
yet, so the team suggests using Labwc or Wayfire instead if you want to
dive into using Xfce on Wayland. While there are plans to port Xfwm4
over to Wayland, this requires a major restructuring and they’re not
going to set any timelines or expectations for when this will be
completed. Regardless, this is an excellent achievement and solid
progress for Xfce on Wayland, which is pretty much a requirement for
Xfce (and other desktop environments) te remain relevant going forward.
Of course, while Wayland is a major focus this release, there’s a lot
more here, too – and that’s not doing the Xfce developers justice. Xfce
4.20 comes packed with so many new features, enchancements, and bug
fixes across the board that I have no idea where to start. I like the
large number of changes to Thunar, like the ability to use symoblic
icons in the sidebar, optimising it for small window sizes,
automatically opening folders when dragging and dropping, and so much
more. They’ve also done another pass to update any remaining icons not
working well on HiDPI displays, removing any instances where you’d
encounter fuzzy icons. I can’t wait to give Xfce 4.20 a go once it lands
in Fedora Xfce.</p>
