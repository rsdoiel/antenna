OSNews extra special discount bonanza extravaganza Black Friday super
coverage</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-29, from: OS News</p>
<p>Today is “Black Friday”, which is the day where a lot of retailers,
both online and offline, pretend to have massive discounts on things
they either raised the prices for a few weeks ago, or for useless
garbage they bought in bulk that’ll end up in a landfill within a year.
Technology media happily partakes in this event, going full-mask off
posting an endless stream of “stories” promoting these discounts.
They’re writing ads for fake discounts, often for products from the very
companies they’re supposed to report on, and dress them up as normal
articles. It’s sad and revealing, highlighting just how much of the
technology media landscape is owned by giant media conglomerates. OSNews
does not partake. We’re independent, answer to nobody, and are mostly
funded directly by you, our readers. If you want to keep it this way,
and keep OSNews free from the tripe you see on every other technology
site around this time, consider supporting us through Patreon, making a
one-time donation through Ko-Fi, or buying some merch. That’s it. That’s
our extra special discount bonanza extravaganza Black Friday super
coverage.</p>

of GNOME’s book, especially when it comes to dialogs and the OSD, which
honestly makes sense considering Cinnamon is also GTK and most Cinnamon
users will be running a ton of GNOME/Libadwaita applications. There’s
also a new night light feature to reduce eyestrain, vastly improved
options for power profiles and management, and more. Cinnamon 6.4 will
be part of Linux Mint’s next major release, coming in late December, but
is most likely already making its way to various other distributions’
repositories.</p>

<h2 id="so-you-want-to-write-a-kmail-plugin">So you want to write a
KMail plugin?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-27, from: OS News</p>
<p>Recently, I’ve been moving away from macOS to Linux, and have settled
on using KDE Plasma as my desktop environment. For the most part I’ve
been comfortable with the change, but it’s always the small things that
get me. For example, the Mail app built into macOS provides an
“Unsubscribe” button for emails. Apparently this is also supported in
some webmail clients, but I’m not interested in accessing my email that
way. Unfortunately, I haven’t found an X11 or Wayland email client that
supports this sort of functionality, so I decided to implement it
myself. And anyway, I’m trying out Kontact for my mail at the moment,
which supports plugins. So why not use this as an opportunity to build
one? ↫ datagirl.xyz Writing a Kmail plugin like this feels a bit like an
arcane art, because the process is not documented as well as it could
be, and I doubt that other than KDE developers themselves, very few
people are interested in writing these kinds of plugins. In fact, I
can’t find a single one listed on the KDE Store, and searching around I
can’t find anything either, other than the ones that come with KDE. It
seems like this particular plugin interface is designed more to make it
easy for KDE developers to extend and alter Kmail than it is for third
parties to do so – and that’s fine. Still, this means that if some third
party does want to write such a plugin, there’s some sleuthing and
hacking to be done, and that’s exactly the process this article details.
In the end, we end up with a working unsubscribe plugin, with the code
on git so others can learn from it. While this may not interest a large
number of people, it’s vital to have information like this out on the
web for those precious few to find – so excellent work.</p>

Copyright Office strikes down proposed game preservation DMCA
exception</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-27, from: OS News</p>
<p>A three-year fight to help support game preservation has come to a
sad end today. The US copyright office has denied a request for a DMCA
exemption that would allow libraries to remotely share digital access to
preserved video games. ↫ Dustin Bailey at GamesRadar This was always
going to end in favour of the massive gaming industry with effectively
bottomless bank accounts and more lawyers than god. The gist is that
Section 1201 of the DMCA prevents libraries from circumventing the copy
protection to make games available remotely. Much like books, libraries
loan out books not just for research purposes, but also for
entertainment purposes, and that’s where the issue lies, according to
the Copyright Office, who wrote “there would be a significant risk that
preserved video games would be used for recreational purposes”. The
games industry doesn’t care about old titles nobody wants to buy anymore
and no consumer is interested in. There’s a long tail of games that have
no monetary value whatsoever, and there’s a relatively small number of
very popular older games that the industry wants to keep repackaging and
reselling forever – I mean, we can’t have a new Nintendo console without
the opportunity to buy Mario Bros. for the 67th time. That’d be
ludicrous. In order to protect the continued free profits from those few
popular retro titles, the endless list of other games only a few nerds
are interested in are sacrificed.</p>

id="the-capacitor-that-apple-soldered-incorrectly-at-the-factory">The
capacitor that Apple soldered incorrectly at the factory</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-27, from: OS News</p>
<p>There have been some past rumblings on the internet about a capacitor
being installed backwards in Apple’s Macintosh LC III. The LC III was a
“pizza box” Mac model produced from early 1993 to early 1994, mainly
targeted at the education market. It also manifested as various consumer
Performa models: the 450, 460, 466, and 467. Clearly, Apple never
initiated a huge recall of the LC III, so I think there is some
skepticism in the community about this whole issue. Let’s look at the
situation in more detail and understand the circuit. Did Apple actually
make a mistake? ↫ Doug Brown Even I had heard of these claims, and I’m
not particularly interested in Apple retrocomputing, other than whatever
comes by on Adrian Black or whatever. As such, it surprises me that
there hasn’t been any definitive answer to this question – with the
amount of interest in classic Macs you’d think this would simply be a
settled issue and everyone would know about it. This vintage of Macs
pretty much require recaps by now, so I assumed if Apple indeed soldered
on a capacitor backwards, it’d just be something listed in the various
recapping guides. It took some very minor digging with the multimeter,
but yes, one of the capacitors on this family of boards is soldered on
the wrong way, with the positive terminal where the negative terminal
should be. It seems the error does not lie with whomever soldered the
capacitors on the boards – or whomever set the machine that did so –
because the silkscreen is labeled incorrectly, too. The reason it
doesn’t seem to be noticeable problem during the expected lifespan of
the computer is because it was rated at 16V, but was only taking in -5V.
So, if you plan on recapping one of these classic Macs – you might as
well fix the error.</p>

browsers and browser engines,” a Mozilla spokesperson tells PCMag.
Mozilla points to a key but less eye-catching proposal from the DOJ to
regulate Google’s search business, which a judge ruled as a monopoly in
August. In their recommendations, federal prosecutors urged the court to
ban Google from offering “something of value” to third-party companies
to make Google the default search engine over their software or devices.
↫ Michael Kan at PC Mag Obviously Mozilla is urging the courts to
reconsider this remedy, because it would instantly cut more than 80% of
Mozilla’s revenue. As I’ve been saying for years now, the reason Firefox
seems to be getting worse is because of Mozilla is desperately trying to
find other sources of revenue, and they seem to think advertising is
their best bet – even going so far as working together with Facebook.
Imagine how much more invasive and user-hostile these attempts are going
to get if Mozilla suddenly loses 80% of its revenue? For so, so many
years now I’ve been warning everyone about just how fragile the future
of Firefox was, and every one of my worries and predictions have become
reality. If Mozilla now loses 80% of its funding, which platform Firefox
officially supports do you think will feel the sting of inevitable
budget cuts, scope reductions, and even more layoffs first? The future
of especially Firefox on Linux is hanging by a thread, and with everyone
lulled into a false sense of complacency by Chrome and its many shady
skins, nobody in the Linux community seems to have done anything to
prepare for this near inevitability. With no proper, fully-featured
replacements in the works, Linux distributions, especially ones with
strict open source requirements, will most likely be forced to ship with
de-Googled Chromium variants by default once Firefox becomes
incompatible with such requirements. And no matter how much you take
Google out of Chromium, it’s still effectively a Google product, leaving
most Linux users entirely at the whim of big tech for the most important
application they have. We’re about to enter a very, very messy time for
browsing on Linux.</p>

<h2 id="leaving-big-tech-behind-murenas-eos-on-the-fairphone-5">Leaving
big tech behind: Murena’s /e/OS on the Fairphone 5</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-25, from: OS News</p>
<p>There are so many ecological, environmental, and climate problems and
disasters taking place all over the world that it’s sometimes hard to
see the burning forests through the charred tree stumps. As at best
middle-income individuals living in this corporate line-must-go-up
hellscape, there’s only so much we can do turn the rising tides of
fascism and leave at least a semblance of a livable world for our
children and grandchildren. Of course, the most elementary thing we can
do is not vote for science-denying death cults who believe everything is
some non-existent entity’s grand plan, but other than that, what’s
really our impact if we drive a little less or use paper straws, when
some wealthy robber baron flying his private jet to Florida to kiss the
gaudy gold ring to signal his obedience does more damage to our world in
one flight than we do in a year of driving to our underpaid, expendable
job? Income, financial, health, and other circumstances allowing, all we
can do are the little things to make ourselves feel better, usually in
areas in which we are knowledgeable. In technology, it might seem like
there’s not a whole lot we can do, but actually there’s quite a few
steps we can take. One of the biggest things you, as an individual
knowledgeable about and interested in tech, can do to give the elite and
ruling class the finger is to move away from big tech, their products,
and their services – no more Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, or
Amazon. This is often a long, tedious, and difficult process, as most of
us will discover that we rely on a lot more big tech products than we
initially thought. It’s like an onion that looks shiny and tasty on the
outside, but is rotting from the inside – the more layers you peel away,
the dirtier and nastier it gets. Also you start crying. I’ve been in the
process of eradicating as much of big tech out of my life for a long
time now. Since four or five years ago, all my desktop and laptop PCs
run Linux, from my dual-Xeon workstation to my high-end gaming PC
(ignore that spare parts PC that runs Windows just for League of
Legends. That stupid game is my guilty pleasure and I will not give it
up), from my XPS 13 laptop to my little Home Assistant thin client. I’ve
never ordered a single thing from Amazon and have no Prime subscription
or whatever it is, so that one was a freebie. Apple I banished from my
life long ago, so that’s another freebie. Sadly, that other device most
of us carry with us remained solidly in the big tech camp, as I’ve been
using an Android phone for a long time, filled to the brim with Google
products, applications, and services. There really isn’t a viable
alternative to the Android and iOS duopoly. Or is there? Well, in a
roundabout way, there is an alternative to iOS and Google’s Android. You
can’t do much to take the Apple out of an iPhone, but there’s a lot you
can do to take the Google out of an Android phone. Unless or until an
independent third platform ever manages to take serious hold – godspeed,
our saviour – de-Googled Android, as it’s called, is your best bet at
having a fully functional, modern smartphone that’s as free from big
tech as you want it to be, without leaving you with a barely usable,
barebones experience. While you can install a de-Googled ROM yourself,
as there’s countless to choose from, this is not an option for everyone,
since not everyone has the skills, time, and/or supported devices to do
so. Murena, Fairphone, and sustainable mining This is where Murena comes
in. Murena is a French company – founded by Gaël Duval, of Mandrake
Linux fame – that develops /e/OS, a de-Googled Android using microG
(which Murena also supports financially), which it makes available for
anyone to install on supported devices, while also selling various
devices with /e/OS preinstalled. Murena goes one step further, however,
by also offering something called Murena Workspace – a branded Nextcloud
offering that works seamlessly with /e/OS. In other words, if you buy an
/e/OS smartphone from Murena, you get the complete package of
smartphone, mobile operating system, and cloud services that’s very
similar to buying a regular Android phone or an iPhone. To help me test
this complete package of smartphone, de-Googled Android, and cloud
services, Murena loaned me a Fairphone 5 with /e/OS preinstalled, and
while this article mostly focuses on the /e/OS experience, we should
first talk a little bit about the relationship between Murena and
Fairphone. Murena and Fairphone are partners, and Murena has been
selling /e/OS Fairphones for a while now. Most of us will be familiar
with Fairphone – it’s a Dutch company focused on designing and selling
smartphones and related accessories that are are user-repairable and
long-lasting, while also trying everything within their power to give
full insight into their supply chain. This is important, because every
smartphone contains quite a few materials that are unsustainably mined.
Many mines are destructive to the environment, have horrible working
conditions, or even sink as low as employing children. Even companies
priding themselves on being environmentally responsible and sustainable,
like Apple, are guilty of partaking in and propping up such mining
endeavours. As consumers, there isn’t much we can do – the network of
supply chains involved in making a smartphone is incredibly complex and
opaque, and there’s basically nothing normal people can do to really
fully know on whose underpaid or even underage shoulders their
smartphone is built. This holiday season, Murena and Fairphone are
collaborating on exactly this issue of the conditions in mines used to
acquire the metals and minerals in our phones. Instead of offering big
discounts (that barely eat into margins and often follow sharp price
increases right before the holidays), Murena and Fairphone will
donate</p>

<h2 id="managing-third-party-packages-in-9front">Managing third-party
packages in 9front</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-24, from: OS News</p>
<p>Every now and then, news from the club I’m too cool to join, the
plan9/9front community, pierces the veil of coolness and enters our
normal world. This time, someone accidentally made a package manager for
9front. I’ve been growing tired of manually handling random software, so
I decided to find a simple way to automate the process and ended up
making a sort of “package manager” for 9front¹. It’s really just a set
of shell scripts that act as a frontend for git and keep a simple
database of package names and URLs. Running the pkginit script will ask
for a location to store the source files for installed packages
(/sys/pkg by default) which will then be created if non-existent. And
that’s it! No, really. Now you can provide a URL for a git repository
to pkg/add. ↫ Kelly “bubstance” Glenn As I somehow expected from 9front,
it’s quite a simple and elegant system. I’m not sure how well it would
handle more complex package operations, but I doubt many 9front systems
are complex to begin with, so this may just be enough to take some of
the tedium out of managing software on 9front, as the author originally
intended. One day I will be cool enough to use 9front. I just have to
stay cool.</p>

<p>date: 2024-11-24, from: OS News</p>
<p>The author of this article, Dr. Casey Lawrence, mentions the opt-out
checkbox is hard to find, and they aren’t kidding. On Windows, here’s
the full snaking path you have to take through Word’s settings to get to
the checkbox: File &gt; Options &gt; Trust Center &gt; Trust Center
Settings &gt; Privacy Options &gt; Privacy Settings &gt; Optional
Connected Experiences &gt; Uncheck box: “Turn on optional connected
experiences”. That is absolutely bananas. No normal person is ever going
to find this checkbox. Anyway, remember how the “AI” believers kept
saying “hey, it’s on the internet so scraping your stuff and violating
your copyright is totally legal you guys!”? Well, what about when you’re
using Word, installed on your own PC, to write private documents,
containing, say, sensitive health information? Or detailed plans about
your company’s competitor to Azure or Microsoft Office? Or
correspondence with lawyers about an antirust lawsuit against Microsoft?
Or a report on Microsoft’s illegal activity you’re trying to report as a
whistleblower? Is that stuff fair game for the gobbledygook generators
too? This “AI” nonsense has to stop. How is any of this even remotely
legal?</p>

(only) a Linux terminal for my personal computing in 2024</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-24, from: OS News</p>
<p>A month and a bit ago, I wondered if I could cope with a
terminal-only computer. The only way to really find out was to give it a
go. My goal was to see what it was like to use a terminal-only computer
for my personal computing for two weeks, and more if I fancied it. ↫
Neil’s blog I tried to do this too, once. Once. Doing everything from
the terminal just isn’t viable for me, mostly because I didn’t grow up
with it. Our family’s first computer ran MS-DOS (with a Windows 3.1
installation we never used), and I’m pretty sure the experience of using
MS-DOS as my first CLI ruined me for life. My mental model for computing
didn’t start forming properly until Windows 95 came out, and as such,
computing is inherently graphical for me, and no matter how many amazing
CLI and TUI applications are out there – and there are many, many
amazing ones – my brain just isn’t compatible with it. There are a few
tasks I prefer doing with the command line, like updating my computers
or editing system files using Nano, but for everything else I’m just
faster and more comfortable with a graphical user interface. This comes
down to not knowing most commands by heart, and often not even knowing
the options and flags for the most basic of commands, meaning even very
basic operations that people comfortable using the command line do
without even thinking, take me ages. I’m glad any modern Linux
distribution – I use Fedora KDE on all my computers – offers both paths
for almost anything you could do on your computer, and unless I
specifically opt to do so, I literally – literally literally – never
have to touch the command line.</p>

Interactive Desktop springs back to life with new release and updated
roadmap</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-24, from: OS News</p>
<p>I had to dive into our archive all the way back to 2017 to find the
last reference to the MaXX Interactive Desktop, and it seems this wasn’t
exactly my fault – the project has been on hiatus since 2020, and is
only now coming back to life, as MaXXdesktop v2.2.0 (nickname Octane)
Alpha-1 has been released, alongside a promising and ambitious roadmap
for the future of the project. For the uninitiated – MaXX is a Linux
reimplementation of the IRIX Interactive Desktop with some
modernisations and other niceties to make it work properly on modern
Linux (and FreeBSD) machines. MaXX has a unique history in that its
creator and lead developer, Eric Masson, managed to secure a special
license agreement with SGI way back in 2005, under which he was allowed
to recreate, from scratch, the IRIX Interactive Desktop on Linux,
including the use of SGI’s trademarks and IRIX’ unique look and feel.
It’s important to note that he did not get access to any code – he was
only allowed to reverse-engineer and recreate it, and because some of
the code falls under this license agreement and some doesn’t, MaXX is
not entirely open source; parts of it are, but not all of it. Any new
code written that doesn’t fall under the license agreement is released
as open source though, and the goal is to, over time, make everything
open source. And as you can tell from this v2.2.0 screenshot, MaXX looks
stunning even at 4K. This new alpha version contains the first changes
to adopt the freedesktop.org application specifications, a new
Exposé-like window overview, tweaks to the modernised version of the
IRIX look and feel (the classic one is also included as an option),
desktop notifications, performance improvements, various modernisations
to the window manager, and so, so much more. For the final release of
2.2.0 and later releases, more changes are planned, like brand new
configuration and system management panels, a quick search tool, a new
file manager, and a ton more. MaXX runs on RHEL/Rocky and Ubuntu, and
probably more Linux distributions, and FreeBSD, and is entirely
free.</p>
