id="migrating-windows-vms-from-proxmox-bioskvm-to-freebsd-uefibhyve">Migrating
Windows VMs from Proxmox BIOS/KVM to FreeBSD UEFI/Bhyve</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-18, from: OS News</p>
<p>Another excellent guide from friend of the website Stefano Marinelli.
A client of mine has several Windows Server VMs, which I had not
migrated to FreeBSD/bhyve until a few weeks ago. These VMs were
originally installed with the traditional BIOS boot mode, not UEFI, on
Proxmox. Fortunately, their virtual disks are on ZFS, which allowed me
to test and achieve the final result in just a few steps. This is
because Windows VMs (server or otherwise) often installed on KVM
(Proxmox, etc.), especially older ones, are non-UEFI, using the
traditional BIOS boot mode. bhyve doesn’t support this setup, but
Windows allows changing the boot mode, and I could perform the migration
directly on the target FreeBSD server. ↫ Stefano Marinelli I link to
guides like these because finding such detailed guides born out of
experience, written by actual humans with actual experience – instead of
bots on content farms – is remarkably hard. There’s more than enough
similar content like this out there covering Windows or popular Linux
distributions like Red Hat, but the BSDs tend to fall a bit short here.
As such, promoting people writing such content is something I’ll happily
do. Marinelli also happens to host the Matrix server (as part of his BSD
Cafe effort) that houses the OSNews Matrix room, accessible by becoming
an OSNews Patreon.</p>

<h2 id="linux-6.12-released">Linux 6.12 released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-18, from: OS News</p>
<p>Version 6.12 of the Linux kernel has been released. The main feature
consists of the merger of the real-time PREEMPT_RT scheduler, most
likely one of the longest-running merger sagas in Linux’ history. This
means that Linux now fully supports both soft and hard real-time
capabilities natively, which is a major step forward for the platform,
especially when looking at embedded development. It’s now no longer
needed to draw in real-time support from outside the kernel. Linux 6.12
also brings a huge number of improvements for graphics drivers, for both
Intel and AMD’s graphics cards. With 6.12, Linux now supports the Intel
Xe2 integrated GPU as well as Intel’s upcoming discrete “Battlemage”
GPUs by default, and it contains more AMD RDNA4 support for those
upcoming GPUs. DRM panics messages in 6.12 will show a QR code you can
scan for more information, a feature written in Rust, and initial
support for the Raspberry Pi 5 finally hit mainline too. Of course,
there’s a lot more in here, like the usual LoongArch and ARM
improvements, new drivers, and so on. and if you’re a regular Linux user
you’ll see 6.12 make it to your distribution within a few weeks or
months.</p>

<h2 id="free-towns-os-an-open-source-recreation-of-fm-towns-os">Free
Towns OS: an open source recreation of FM Towns OS</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>A few weeks ago I linked to a story by Misty De Meo, in which they
explored what happened to the various eccentric Japanese PC platforms.
One of the platforms mentioned was FM Towns, made by Fujitsu, which came
with its own graphical operating system from the era of Windows 3.x. I
had never heard of this one before, but it looks incredibly interesting,
with some unique UI ideas I’d love to explore, if only I could read
Japanese. Since learning Japanese is a serious life-long commitment, I
can safely say that’s not going to happen. It seems I’m not the only one
interested in FM Towns, as a new project called Free Towns OS (or
Tsugaru OS in Japanese) aims to provide an open source replacement for
the Free Towns operating system. The goal of this project is to write a
copyright-free FM Towns OS to run free games and the re-released games,
or why not a brand-new game for FM Towns. without concerns of violating
copyrights of the files included in the original Towns OS. Let’s see how
far we can go! But, so far so good. Now Tsugaru OS is capable of running
the three probably the most popular free games, Panic Ball 2, VSGP, and
Sky Duel. All playable without single file from the original Towns OS. ↫
Free Towns OS GitHub page That’s a pretty good milestone already. The
project aims to eventually also be able to run on real hardware instead
of just emulators, but further than that, it’s difficult for me to
extract more information from the descriptions since not every paragraph
has been translated to English just yet. Finding English information on
FM Towns OS in general is hard, so I’m also not entirely sure just how
much the project has already been able to recreate. I definitely hope
this effort attracts more interest, hopefully also from outside of Japan
so we can get a translated version people outside of Japan can use.</p>
