      <h1>It turns out Nokia’s legendary font makes for a great general user interface font</h1>

(date: 2025-08-29, from: <a href="https://www.osnews.com/story/143222/it-turns-out-nokias-legendary-font-makes-for-a-great-general-user-interface-font/">https://www.osnews.com/story/143222/it-turns-out-nokias-legendary-font-makes-for-a-great-general-user-interface-font/</a>)
      <p>
      If you&#8217;re of a certain age (and not American), there&#8217;s a specific corporate font you&#8217;re most likely aware of. You may not know its exact name, and you may not actively remember it, but once you see it, you know exactly what you&#8217;re looking at. The font&#8217;s called Nokia Sans (and Nokia Serif), and it was used by pretty much every single Nokia device between roughly 2002 and 2013 or so, when it was replaced by a very bland font made by Bruno Maag (with help from the person who designed Comic Sans) that they used after that. I can&#8217;t remember why, exactly, but I got majorly nostalgic for Nokia&#8217;s characteristic, recognisable font, and decided to see if it would work as a user interface font. Now, the font is still owned by Nokia and I couldn&#8217;t find a proper place to download it, but I eventually stumbled upon a site that had each individual variant listed for download. I downloaded each of them, installed them using KDE&#8217;s font installation method, and tried it out as my user interface font. You&#8217;ll quickly discover you shouldn&#8217;t use the regular variant, but should instead opt for the Nokia Sans Wide variant. Back in 2011, when Nokia originally announced it was replacing Nokia Sans, the creator of the font, Erik Spiekermann, responded to the announcement on his blog. Apparently, one of the major reasons for Nokia to change fonts was that they claimed Nokia Sans wouldn&#8217;t work as a user interface font, but Spiekermann obviously disagrees, pointing specifically to the Wide variant. In fact, Spiekermann does not pull any punches. After 10 years it was high time to look at Nokia’s typefaces as the dominant visual voice of the brand but whoever decided on a completely new direction was either not aware of what was available or was persuaded by Bruno Maag to start over. Bruno may not create the most memorable typefaces, but he certainly knows how to sell them. And technically, their fonts are excellent. Too bad they didn’t have the confidence to work with me on an update. Instead they’re throwing out ten years of brand recognition in favour of blandness. ↫ Erik Spiekermann I was pleasently surprised by just how nice the font looks when used as a general user interface font. It&#8217;s extremely legible at a variety of sizes, and has a ton of character without becoming gimmicky or overbearing. What originally started as mere curiosity has now become my UI font of choice on all my machines, finally displacing Inter after many years of uncontested service. Of course, all of this is deeply personal and 95% an issue of taste, but I wanted to write about it to see if I&#8217;m just entirely crazy, or if there&#8217;s some method to my madness. Do note that I&#8217;m using high DPI displays, and KDE on Wayland, and that all of this may look different on Windows or macOS, or on displays with lower DPI. One of Inter&#8217;s strengths is that it renders great on both high and lower DPI displays, but since I don&#8217;t have any lower DPI displays anymore, I can&#8217;t test it in such an environment. I&#8217;m also not entirely sure about the legal status of downloading fonts like this, but I am fairly sure you&#8217;re at least allowed to use non-free fonts for personal, non-commercial use, but please don&#8217;t quote me on that. Since downloading each variant of these Nokia fonts is annoying, I&#8217;d love to create and upload a zip file containing all of them, but I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s illegal. I&#8217;m not a font connoisseur, so I may be committing a huge faux pas here? Not that I care, but reading about font nerds losing their minds over things I never even noticed is always highly entertaining.

      <h1>Blocky Planet: making Minecraft spherical</h1>

      <p>
      Blocky Planet is a tech demo I created in the&#160;Unity game engine&#160;that attempts to map Minecraft’s cubic voxels onto a spherical planet. The planet is procedurally generated and fully destructible, allowing players to place or remove more than 20 different block types. While much of the implementation relies on common techniques you’d expect from your average Kirkland brand Minecraft clone, the spherical structure introduces a number of unique design considerations. This post will focus on these more novel challenges. ↫ Bowerbyte What a great read. Turning a &#8216;flat earth&#8217; game like Minecraft into something taking place on a spherical world seems impossible at first, but it seems Bowerbyte managed to do it. If you&#8217;ve ever wondered what it would be like to play a Minecraft-like game on an actual sphere, this is it.

      <h1>Genode OS Framework 25.08 released</h1>

(date: 2025-08-28, from: <a href="https://www.osnews.com/story/143214/genode-os-framework-25-08-released/">https://www.osnews.com/story/143214/genode-os-framework-25-08-released/</a>)
      <p>
      Genode 25.08 is ripe with deeply technical topics that have been cooking since the beginning of the year or even longer. In particular our new kernel scheduler as the flagship feature of this release has been in the works since February 2024. Section&#160;Kernel scheduling for fairness and low latency&#160;tells its background story and explains the approach taken. Another culmination of a long-term endeavor is the introduction of an alternative to XML syntax, specifically designed for the usage patterns of Genode and Sculpt OS. Section&#160;Consideration of a lean alternative to XML&#160;kicks off the practical evaluation of an idea that gradually evolved over more than two years. Also the holistic storage optimizations presented in Section&#160;Block-storage stack renovations&#160;are the result of careful long-term analysis, planning, and execution. ↫ Genode 25.08 release notes While these are the three tentpole features for this release, there&#8217;s a whole lot more here, as well. Genode&#8217;s Linux-based PC device drivers have all been updated to Linux 6.12, there are a ton of fixes related to USB, optional EFI boot support in VirtualBox 6, and tons more.

      <h1>The EU needs a corporate “open source contribution tax” to fund open source maintainers</h1>

(date: 2025-08-28, from: <a href="https://www.osnews.com/story/143211/the-eu-needs-a-corporate-open-source-contribution-tax-to-fund-open-source-maintainers/">https://www.osnews.com/story/143211/the-eu-needs-a-corporate-open-source-contribution-tax-to-fund-open-source-maintainers/</a>)
      <p>
      Open source, the thing that drives the world, the thing Harvard says has an economic value of 8.8 trillion dollars (also a big number). Most of it is one person. And I can promise you not one of those single person projects have the proper amount of resources they need. If you want to talk about possible risks to your supply chain, a single maintainer that’s grossly underpaid and overworked. That’s the risk. The country they are from is irrelevant. ↫ Josh Bressers If the massive corporations that exploit the open source world for massive personal profit don&#8217;t want to contribute back, perhaps it&#8217;s time we start making them. I envision an European Economic Area-wide &#8220;open source contribution tax&#8221;, levied against any technology corporation operating within the European Economic Area, whether they actually make use of open source code or not, not entirely unlike how insurance works &#8211; you pay into it even if you don&#8217;t make any claims. Such tax could be based on revenue, number of users, or any combination thereof or other factors. The revenue from this open source contribution tax is put into an EEA-wide fund and redistributed to EEA-based open source maintainers in the form of a monetary subsidy. Such types of taxes and money redistribution frameworks already exist in virtually every country for a whole wide variety of purposes and in a wide variety of forms, both in non-commercial and commercial settings. While it may seem complicated at first, it really isn&#8217;t. The most difficult aspect is definitely figuring out who, exactly, would be eligible to receive the subsidy and how much, but that, too, is a question both governments and commercial entities answer every single day. No, it will never be perfect, and some people will receive a subsidy who shouldn&#8217;t, and some who should receive it will not, but if that&#8217;s a valid reason not to implement a tax like this, no tax or insurance should be implemented. The benefits are legion. Of course, there is the primary benefit of alleviating the thousands of open source maintainers who form the backbone of pretty much out entire digital infrastructure, which in and of itself should be reason enough. On top of that, it would also strengthen the open source world &#8211; on which, I wish to reiterate, our entire digital infrastructure is built &#8211; against the kind of infiltration we saw with XZ Utils. And to put another top on top of that, it would cement Europe, or the EEA more specifically, as the hub for open source development, innovation, and leadership, and would surely attract countless open source maintainers to relocate to Europe. In other words, it would serve the grander European ambition to become less dependent on the criminal behaviour US tech giants and the erratic behaviour of the US government. We can either wait indefinitely for those who exploit the free labour of open source maintainers to contribute, or we make them.

      <h1>In-application browsers: the worst erosion of user choice you haven’t heard of</h1>

      <p>
      A long, long time ago, Android treated browser tabs in a very unique way. Individual tabs were were seen as &#8216;applications&#8217;, and would appear interspersed with the recent applications list as if they were, indeed, applications. This used to be one of my favourite Android features, as it made websites feel very well integrated into the overall user experience, and gave them a sense of place within your workflows. Eventually, though, Google decided to remove this unique approach, as we can&#8217;t have nice things and everything must be bland, boring, and the same, and now finding a website you have open requires going to your browser and finding the correct tab. More approachable to most people, I&#8217;d wager, but a reduction in usability, for me. I still mourn this loss. Similarly, we&#8217;ve seen a huge increase in the use of in-application browsers, a feature designed to trap users inside applications, instead of letting them freely explore the web the moment they click on a link inside an application. Application developers don&#8217;t want you leaving their application, so almost all of them, by default, will now open a webview inside the application when you click on an outbound link. For advertising companies, like Google and Facebook, this has the additional benefit of circumventing any and all privacy protections you may have set up in your browser, since those won&#8217;t apply to the webview the application opens. This sucks. I hate in-application browsers with a passion. Decades of internet use have taught me that clicking on a link means I&#8217;m opening a website in my browser. That&#8217;s what I want, that&#8217;s what I expect, and that&#8217;s how it should be. In-application webviews entirely break this normal chain of events; not because it improves the user experience, but because it benefits the bottom line of others. It&#8217;s also a massive security risk. Worst of all, this switch grants these apps the ability to spy and manipulate third-party websites. Popular apps like Instagram, Facebook Messenger and Facebook have all been caught injecting JavaScript via their in-app browsers into third party websites. TikTok was running commands that were essentially a keylogger. While we have no proof that this data was used or exfiltrated from the device, the mere presence of JavaScript code collecting this data combined with no plausible explanation is extremely concerning. ↫ Open Web Advocacy Open Web Advocacy has submitted a detailed and expansive report to the European Commission detailing the various issues with these in-application browsers, and suggests a number of remedies to strengthen security, improve privacy, and preserve browser choice. I hope this gets picked up, because in-application browsers are just another way in which we&#8217;re losing control over our devices.

      <h1>Word to save new files on Microsoft’s servers by default</h1>

      You already need custom scripts and third-party applications that make custom Windows ISOs to make installing Windows somewhat bearable &#8211; unless you enjoy spending hours manually disabling all the anti-user settings in Windows &#8211; and now there&#8217;s another setting to add to the massive, growing list of stuff you have to fix after setting up a new Windows installation. Microsoft has announced that Word will start saving every new file to OneDrive (or another provider if you&#8217;ve installed one) by default. We are modernizing the way files are created and stored in Word for Windows! Now you don’t have to worry about saving your documents: Anything new you create will be saved automatically to OneDrive or your preferred cloud destination. ↫ Raul Munoz on the Microsoft 365 Insider Blog There&#8217;s the usual spiel of how this is safer and supposedly more convenient, but I suspect the real reason Microsoft is doing this is listed right there at the end of the list of supposed benefits: this enables the use of Copilot&#8217;s &#8220;AI&#8221; features right from the beginning. In other words, by automatically saving your new Word documents to OneDrive by default, you&#8217;re giving Microsoft access to whatever you write for &#8220;AI&#8221; training purposes. The setting can be changed, but defaults matter and few people change them. It&#8217;s also possible to set another provider than OneDrive as your online storage, but again &#8211; defaults matter. In fact, I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if few people will even realise their Word documents will be stored not on their local PC, but on Microsoft&#8217;s servers.

      <h1>Dick Pick’s unique database operating system</h1>

      <p>
      We usually at least recognize old computer hardware and software names. But Asianmoetry taught us a new one: Pick OS. This 1960s-era system was sort of a database and sort of an operating system for big iron used by the Army. The request was for an English-like query language, and TRW assigned two guys, Don Nelson and Dick Pick, to the job. The planned query language would allow for things like “list the title, author, and abstract of every transportation system reference with the principal city ‘Los Angeles’.” This was GIM or generalized information management, and, in a forward-looking choice, it ran in a virtual machine. ↫ Al Williams at Hackaday The linked article is a short summary of a YouTube video by the YouTube channel Asianometry, which goes into a lot more detail about Pick OS, where it came from, what it can do, who the people involved were, and where Pick OS eventually ended up. I had never heard of this system before, and it&#8217;s easy to see why &#8211; not only was it used almost exclusively in vertically integrated complete solutions, it was also whitelabeled, so it existed under countless different names. Regardless, it seems the people who actually had to use it were incredibly enthusiastic about it, and to this day you can read new comments from people fondly remembering how easy to use it was. It has always been proprietary, and still is to this day, apparently owned by a company called Rocket Software, who don&#8217;t seem to actually be doing anything with it.

      <h1>Guix gets a new Rust packaging model</h1>

(date: 2025-08-26, from: <a href="https://www.osnews.com/story/143182/guix-gets-a-new-rust-packaging-model/">https://www.osnews.com/story/143182/guix-gets-a-new-rust-packaging-model/</a>)
      <p>
      While Nix and NixOS get all the attention when it comes to declarative package management, there are other, competing implementations of the same general idea. Guix, developed as part of the GNU Project, was originally based on Nix, but grew into its own thing. The project recently announced a major change to how it packages Rust and its countless dependencies and optional &#8216;crates&#8217;. We have changed to a simplified Rust packaging model that is easier to automate and allows for modification, replacement and deletion of dependencies at the same time. The new model will significantly reduce our Rust packaging time and will help us to improve both package availability and quality. ↫ Hilton Chain at the Guix blog I hear people talk about Nix and NixOS all the time &#8211; I tried it myself, too, but I felt I was using an IBM z17 mainframe to watch a YouTube video &#8211; and in fact, Nix has kind of become a meme in and of itself, but you never hear people talk about Guix. With this being OSNews, I&#8217;m assuming there&#8217;s going to be people here using it, and I&#8217;m incredibly curious about your experiences. What are the features and benefits that make you use it? If you&#8217;re curious &#8211; the best way to try Guix is probably to install the GNU Guix System, the Linux distribution built around Guix and Shepard, GNU&#8217;s alternative init system. It&#8217;s available for i686, x86_64, ARMv7, and AArch64, and can be virtualised too, of course.

      I recently moved to an area with more internet provider options, all of which were not satellite-based. This change allowed me leave my current provider (Starlink) and also freed my network from being locked behind CGNAT. The jump from ~150Mbps to 1Gbps has been fantastic, but the real benefit in this switch has been the ability to overhaul my home network setup. ↫ Bradley Taunt OpenBSD is generally the way to go for custom router setups, it seems, and if it wasn&#8217;t for my own full Ubiquiti setup, I&#8217;d definitely consider this too.

Google is effectively recreating Apple&#8217;s Gatekeeper for macOS, but on Android. It won&#8217;t come as a surprise to you that Google is doing this in the name of security and protecting users. The company claims that its own analysis found &#8220;over 50 times more malware from internet-sideloaded sources than on apps available through Google Play&#8221;, and the main reason is that malware developers can hide behind anonymity. As such, Google&#8217;s solution is to simply deanonymise every single Android developer. Starting next year, Android will require all apps to be registered by verified developers in order to be installed by users on certified Android devices. This creates crucial accountability, making it much harder for malicious actors to quickly distribute another harmful app after we take the first one down. Think of it like an ID check at the airport, which confirms a traveler&#8217;s identity but is separate from the security screening of their bags; we will be confirming who the developer is, not reviewing the content of their app or where it came from. This change will start in a few select countries specifically impacted by these forms of fraudulent app scams, often from repeat perpetrators. ↫ Suzanne Frey at the Android Developer Blog This new policy will only apply to &#8220;certified Android devices&#8221;, which means Android devices that ship with Google Play Services and all related Google stuff preinstalled. How this policy will affect devices running de-Googled Android ROMs like GrapheneOS where the user has opted to install the Play Store and Google Play Services is unclear. Google does claim the personal information you hand over as part of your registration will remain entirely private and not be shown to anyone, but that&#8217;s not going to reassure anyone. To its small credit, Google intends to create an Android Developer Console explicitly for developers who only operate outside of the Play Store, and a special workflow for students and hobbyists that waives the $25 fee. First tests will start in October of this year, with an official rollout in a number of countries later in 2026, which will then expand to cover the whole world. The first countries seeing the official rollout will be countries hit especially hard by scams (according to Google&#8217;s research, at least): Brazil, Indonesia, Singapore, and Thailand. Google has been trying to claw back control over Android for years now, and it seems the pace is accelerating lately. None of these steps should surprise you, but they should highlight just how crucially important it is that we somehow managed to come to a viable third way, something not controlled by either Apple or Google.

      <h1>“I revived pkgsrc on AIX”</h1>

      <p>
      Earlier this year, I was trying to get actual daily work done on HP-UX 11.11 (11i v1) running on HP&#8217;s last and greatest PA-RISC workstation, the HP c8000. After weeks of frustration caused first by outdated software no longer working properly with the modern web, and then by modern software no longer compiling on HP-UX 11.11, I decided to play the ace up my sleeve: NetBSD&#8217;s pkgsrc has support for HP-UX. Sadly, HP-UX is obviously not a main platform or even a point of interest for pkgsrc developers &#8211; as it should be, nobody uses this combination &#8211; so various incompatibilities and more modern requirements had snuck into pkgsrc, and I couldn&#8217;t get it to bootstrap. I made some minor progress here and there with the help of people far smarter than I, but in the end I just lacked the skills to progress any further. This story will make it to OSNews in a more complete form, I promise. Anyway, in May of this year, it seems Brian Robert Callahan was working on a very similar problem: getting pkgsrc to work properly on IBM&#8217;s AIX. The state of packages on AIX genuinely surprises me. IBM hosts a&#160;repository&#160;of open source software for AIX. But it seems pretty sparse compared to what you&#160;could&#160;get with pkgsrc. Another&#160;website&#160;offering AIX packages seems quite old. I think pkgsrc would be a great way to bring modern packages to AIX. I am not the first to think this. There are AIX 7.2 pkgsrc packages available at&#160;this repository, however all the packages are compiled as 32-bit RISC System/6000 objects. I would greatly prefer to have everything be 64-bit XCOFF objects, as we could do more with 64-bit programs. There also aren&#8217;t too many packages in that repository, so I think starting fresh is in our best interest. As we shall see, this was not as straightforward as I would have hoped. ↫ Brian Robert Callahan Reading through his journey getting pkgsrc to work properly on AIX, I can&#8217;t help but feel a bit better about myself not being to get it to work on HP-UX 11.11. Callahan was working with AIX 7.2 TL4, which was released in November 2019 and still actively supported by IBM on a maintained architecture, while I was working with HP-UX 11.11 (or 11i v1), which last got some updates in and around 2005, running on an architecture that&#8217;s well dead and buried. Looking at what Callahan still had to figure out and do, it&#8217;s not surprising someone with my lack of skill in this area couldn&#8217;t get it working. I&#8217;m still hoping someone far smarter than I stumbles upon a HP c8000 and dives into getting pkgsrc to work on HP-UX, because I feel pkgsrc could turn an otherwise incredibly powerful HP c8000 from a strictly retro machine into something borderline usable in the modern world. HP-UX is much harder to virtualise &#8211; if it&#8217;s even possible at all &#8211; so real hardware is probably going to be required. The NetBSD people on Mastodon suggested I could possibly give remote access to my machine so someone could dive into this, which is something I&#8217;ll keep under consideration.

      <h1>Windows 11 to get ability to resume applications from Android which nobody will implement</h1>

(date: 2025-08-25, from: <a href="https://www.osnews.com/story/143165/windows-11-to-get-ability-to-resume-applications-from-android-which-nobody-will-implement/">https://www.osnews.com/story/143165/windows-11-to-get-ability-to-resume-applications-from-android-which-nobody-will-implement/</a>)
      <p>
      The history of Android applications on Windows is convoluted, with various failed and cancelled attempts by Microsoft to allow Windows users to run Android applications behind us. Now that these attempts are well dead and buried, Microsoft is going at it from a different perspective: what if you could continue where you left off on your Android phone, right on your Windows machine, but without having to run an Android applications on Windows? We are beginning to gradually roll out the ability to seamlessly resume using your favorite apps from your Android phone on your Windows 11 PC to Windows Insiders in the Dev and Beta Channels. To start with, you will be able to resume or continue listening to your favorite Spotify tracks and episodes right from where you left off on the Spotify app on your Android phone. First, start listening to one of your favorite songs or episodes in the Spotify app on your Android phone. On your PC (running the latest Insider Preview builds in the Dev or Beta Channels) a ‘Resume alert’&#160;will appear on&#160;your taskbar. When you click on that alert, Spotify’s desktop app will open and the same track will now continue playing on your PC. ↫ Amanda Langowski and Brandon LeBlanc So basically, the Spotify application on Windows will know where you left off on the Spotify application on Android, and resume playback. This is table-stakes for most services, and it doesn&#8217;t seem like it would warrant such a big announcement from Microsoft, and while I don&#8217;t use Spotify, I assume it was already built into the service anyway. It seems all Microsoft is doing is providing a nice little notification to expose that functionality a little bit more clearly, but it also explains that you need to manually link your device and the Spotify Android application to the Windows PC and Spotify Windows application, which seems like a lot of manual steps. Does this mean every application developer needs to opt into this and add this feature, thereby making it dead on arrival? Well, yes, you&#8217;ll need to add support on both sides of the equation, which I can guarantee you very few developers will do. Not only does this feature require you to already have a Windows version of your application &#8211; which, statistically, you don&#8217;t &#8211; it also requires you to do the work yourself, and manually apply to Microsoft to even gain access to the required APIs and SDKs. The odds of this feature making it beyond a few very big names Microsoft can give money to is slim.

      I have a slight problem wherein every time I start up a game of NetHack, I completely lose touch with my surroundings for hours on end. Thankfully&#160;The DevTeam Thinks Of Everything&#160;and there’s a solution that allows communication with the outside world without breaking immersion: the mail daemon! If compiled with&#160;-DMAIL&#160;and&#160;OPTIONS=mail&#160;is set in your runtime configuration (the default on Linux), NetHack will periodically check a user specified mbox file (MAIL) for new mail, and upon receiving an email a mail daemon will spawn in and deliver a scroll of mail to the player. Upon reading this scroll a mail program (MAILREADER) will be executed, which hopefully allows you to read your mail. ↫ George Huebner I love everything about this.

      <h1>Nitro: a tiny but flexible init system and process supervisor</h1>

(date: 2025-08-24, from: <a href="https://www.osnews.com/story/143156/nitro-a-tiny-but-flexible-init-system-and-process-supervisor/">https://www.osnews.com/story/143156/nitro-a-tiny-but-flexible-init-system-and-process-supervisor/</a>)
      <p>
      The most unlikely subsystem of contention is definitely the init system used by Linux, with most popular distributions opting for systemd, while a vocal minority prefers to use something else. Neither of these two groups are wrong or right, as we live in a free world and different people have different needs and desires. Personally, I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s a more utterly pointless and meaningless debate than this, and people who make the init system they use their entire personality more often than not come across as really, really sad. It&#8217;s a tool; use the one you like and move on with life. A brand new init system was recently released by Leah Neukirchen, who among a ton of other things, contributes to Void Linux. It&#8217;s called nitro, and it&#8217;s a &#8220;tiny process supervisor that also can be used as pid 1 on Linux&#8221;, and it also can be used on FreeBSD supervised by FreeBSD&#8217;s init. There&#8217;s some overlap with runit here, so Neukirchen published a blog post detailing the differences between the two, which should help in getting a better understanding of what makes nitro stand apart. While both use a directory of services managed by small scripts, nitro seems to opt for a more contained, monolithic approach, as it keeps everything in a single process. On top of that, Nitro contains some new features runit doesn&#8217;t have. The focus seems to be on integrating a few capabilities that on runit require hacks, but on nitro are just built-in, like &#8220;support for one-shot &#8216;services&#8217;, i.e. running scripts on up/down without a process to supervise (e.g. persist audio volume, keep RNG state)&#8221;, running service directories multiple times, and more. Nitro also maintains its runtime state in RAM and provides an IPC service to query it, meaning it can be run on read-only filesystems without special configuration. There&#8217;s a lot more information in Neukirchen&#8217;s blog post, including a look at some of the current limitations of Nitro. I highly suggest reading it, and perhaps we will see nitro as another valid alternative to the popular systemd.

      <h1>The “AI” bubble is showing cracks, and Microsoft ruins Excel</h1>

(date: 2025-08-21, from: <a href="https://www.osnews.com/story/143148/the-ai-bubble-is-showing-cracks-and-microsoft-ruins-excel/">https://www.osnews.com/story/143148/the-ai-bubble-is-showing-cracks-and-microsoft-ruins-excel/</a>)
      <p>
      It&#8217;s not AI winter just yet, though there is a distinct chill in the air. Meta is shaking up and downsizing its artificial intelligence division. A new report out of MIT finds that 95 percent of companies&#8217; generative AI programs have failed to earn any profit whatsoever. Tech stocks tanked Tuesday, regarding broader fears that this bubble may have swelled about as large as it can go. Surely, there will be no wider repercussions for normal people if and when Nvidia, currently propping up the market like a load-bearing matchstick, finally runs out of fake companies to sell chips to. But getting in under the wire, before we&#8217;re all bartering gas in the desert and people who can read become the priestly caste, is Microsoft, with the single most &#8220;Who asked for this?&#8221; application of AI I&#8217;ve seen yet: They&#8217;re jamming it into Excel. ↫ Barry Petchesky at Defector I&#8217;m going to skip over the mounting and palpable uneasiness that the cracks in the &#8220;AI&#8221; bubble are starting to form, and go right to that thing about Excel. Quite possible one of the most successful applications of all time, and the backbone of countless small, medium, and even large business, it started out as a Mac program to supplant Microsoft&#8217;s MultiPlan, which was being clobbered in the market by Lotus 1-2-3. It wasn&#8217;t until version 2.0 that it came to Intel, as an application that contained a Windows runtime. It was a port of Excel 2.0 for the Mac. Anyway, it took a few years, but Excel took over the market, and I don&#8217;t think any other spreadsheet program has ever even remotely threatened its market dominance ever since. Well, not until Google Sheets arrived on the scene &#8211; it&#8217;s hard to find any useful numbers, but it seems Google Sheets is insanely popular in all kinds of sectors, at least according to Statista. They claim Google&#8217;s online office suite has a 49% market share, with Microsoft Office sitting at 29%. I have no idea how that translates into the usage shares of Google Sheets versus Microsoft Excel, but it&#8217;s a sign of the times, regardless. One of the things you&#8217;d expect a spreadsheet to do is calculate numbers and tabulate data, and to do so accurately. The core competency of a computer is to compute, do stuff with numbers, and we&#8217;d flip out collective shit if our computers failed to do such basic arithmetic. So, what if I told you that Microsoft, in its infinite wisdom, has decided to add &#8220;AI&#8221; to Excel, and as such, has to add a disclaimer that this means Excel may not do basic arithmetic correctly? Look, we can all disagree on the use of &#8220;AI&#8221;, where it makes sense, where it doesn&#8217;t, if it even does anything useful, and so on, but I would assume &#8211; for the world&#8217;s sake &#8211; that we can at least agree that using &#8220;AI&#8221; in an application used to do very important calculations for a lot of business is a really, really dumb idea? Is the person doing the bookkeeping in Excel at Windmill Restaurant, in Spearville, Kansas, properly aware of the limitations of &#8220;AI&#8221;, or are they not following technology that closely, and as such only hear the marketing and hype? A spreadsheet should give accurate outcomes based on the input given by humans. The moment you let a confabulator loose on your spreadsheet, it ceases being a tool that can be used for anything even remotely serious. The fact that Microsoft is adding this nonsense to Excel and letting it loose on the unsuspecting public at large is absolutely wild to me, and I can assure you it&#8217;s going to have serious consequences for a lot of people. Microsoft, of course, will be able to point at the disclaimer buried in some random support document and absolve itself of any and all responsibility. I&#8217;d like to point out that Lotus 1-2-3 probably still runs on Windows 11, for no reason at all.

      <p>
      <p>Instagram’s latest update introduces a mapping feature that quietly turns your location into a public breadcrumb trail. While it may seem like a harmless way to tag your favorite coffee shop or scenic overlook, the reality is more insidious: this feature keeps your location sharing always-on by default. That means every time you post, you’re potentially broadcasting your whereabouts—not just to friends, but to advertisers, data brokers, and anyone else watching. It’s a textbook example of how convenience is weaponized against privacy.</p>
