<h2 id="lets-talk-about-bias">Let’s talk about bias</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-13, from: OS News</p>
<p>When someone says you’re biased against them because you object to
their stated goal of removing you from society, they’re not actually
asking for fairness — they’re demanding complicity. It’s the political
equivalent of asking why the gazelle seems to have such a negative view
of lions. Think about the underlying logic here: I’m biased because I
don’t give equal weight to both sides of a debate about my fundamental
rights. I’m biased because I notice patterns in political movements that
explicitly state their intentions regarding people like me. I’m biased
because I take them at their word when they tell me what they plan to
do. ↫ Joan Westenberg OSNews and I will always stand for the right of
transgender people to exist, and to enjoy the exact same rights and
privileges as any other member of society. This is non-negotiable.</p>

<p>Enlightenment 0.27.0 has been released, and we’ve got some highly

Haitzler That’s it. That’s the release notes. Digging into the commit
history between 0.26.0 and 0.27.0 gives some more information, and here
we can see that a lot of work has been done on the CPU frequency applet
(including hopefully making it work properly on FreeBSD), a lot of
updated translations, some RandR work, and a ton of other small changes.
Does any one of us use Enlightenment on a daily basis? I’m actually
intrigued by this release, as it’s the first one in two years, and aside
from historical usage decades ago – like many of us, I assume – I
haven’t really spent any time with the current incarnation.</p>

you complete the Oregon Trail if you wait at a river for 14272 years: a
study</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-13, from: OS News</p>
<p>Two years ago, Twitch streamer albrot discovered a bug in the code
for crossing rivers. One of the options is to “wait to see if conditions
improve”; waiting a day will consume food but not recalculate any health
conditions, granting your party immortality. From this conceit the
Oregon Trail Time Machine was born; a multiday livestream of the game as
the party waits for conditions to improve at the final Snake River
crossing until the year 10000, to see if the withered travellers can
make it to the ruins of ancient Oregon. The first attempt ended in
tragedy; no matter what albrot tried, the party would succumb to disease
and die almost immediately. A couple of days before New Years Eve 2025,
albrot reached out and asked if I knew anything about Apple II hacking.
↫ Scott Percival It may have required some reverse engineering and
hackery, but yes, you can reach the ruins of Oregon in the year
16120.</p>

<p>date: 2025-01-13, from: OS News</p>
<p>Mastodon, the only remaining social network that isn’t a fascist
hellhole like Twitter or Facebook, is changing its legal and operational
foundation to a proper European non-profit. Simply, we are going to
transfer ownership of key Mastodon ecosystem and platform components
(including name and copyrights, among other assets) to a new non-profit
organization, affirming the intent that Mastodon should not be owned or
controlled by a single individual. It also means a different role for
Eugen, Mastodon’s current CEO. Handing off the overall Mastodon
management will free him up to focus on product strategy where his
original passion lies and he gains the most satisfaction. ↫ Official
Mastodon blog Eugen Rochko has always been clear and steadfast about
Mastodon not being for sale and not accepting any outside investments
despite countless offers, and after eight years of both creating and
running Mastodon, it makes perfect sense to move the network and its
assets to a proper European non-profit. Mastodon’s actual control over
the entire federated ActivityPub network – the Fediverse – is actually
limited, so it’s not like the network is dependent on Mastodon, but
there’s no denying it’s the most well-known part of the Fediverse. The
Fediverse is the only social network on which OSNews is actively present
(and myself, too, for that matter). By “actively present” I only mean
I’m keeping an eye on any possible replies; the feed itself consists
exclusively of links to our stories as soon as they’re published, and
that’s it. Everything else you might encounter on social media is either
legacy cruft we haven’t deleted yet, or something a third-party set up
that we don’t control. RSS means it’s easy for people to set up
third-party, unaffiliated accounts on any social medium posting links to
our stories, and that’s entirely fine, of course. However, corporate
social media controlled by the irrational whims of delusional
billionaires with totalitarian tendencies is not something we want to be
a part of, so aside from visiting OSNews.com and using our RSS feeds,
the only other official way to follow OSNews is on Mastodon.</p>

<h2 id="wordpress-is-in-trouble">WordPress is in trouble</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-13, from: OS News</p>
<p>It’s hard to see how to move forward from here. I think the best bet
would be for people to rally around a new community-driven
infrastructure. This would likely require a fork of WordPress, though,
and that’s going to be a messy. The current open source version of
WordPress relies on the sites and services Mullenweg controls. Joost de
Valk, the original creator of an extremely popular SEO plugin, wrote a
blog post with some thoughts on the matter. I’m hoping that more
prominent people in the community step up like this, and that some way
forward can be found. Update: Moments after posting this, I was pointed
to a story on TechCrunch about Mullenweg deactivating the WordPress.org
accounts of users planning a “fork”. This after he previously promoted
(though in a slightly mocking way) the idea of forking open source
software. In both cases, the people he mentioned weren’t actually
planning forks, but musing about future ways forward for WordPress.
Mullenweg framed the account deactivations as giving people the push
they need to get started. Remember that WordPress.org accounts are
required to submit themes, plugins, or core code to the WordPress
project. These recent events really make it seem like you’re no longer
welcome to contribute to WordPress if you question Matt Mullenweg. ↫
Gavin Anderegg I haven’t wasted a single word on the ongoing WordPress
drama yet, but the longer Matt Mullenweg, Automattic’s CEO and thus
owner of WordPress, keeps losing his mind, I can’t really ignore the
matter any more. OSNews runs, after all, on WordPress – self-hosted, at
least, so not on Mullenweg’s WordPress.com – and if things keep going
the way they are, I simply don’t know if WordPress remains a viable,
safe, and future-proof CMS for OSNews. I haven’t discussed this
particular situation with OSNews owner, David Adams, yet, mostly since
he’s quite hands-off in the day-to-day operations and has more than
enough other matters to take care of, but I think the time has come to
start planning for a potential worst-case scenario in which Mullenweg
takes even more of whatever he’s taking and WordPress implodes entirely.
Remember – even if you self-host WordPress outside of Automattic,
several core infrastructure parts of WordPress still run through
Automattic, so we’re still dependent on what Mullenweg does or doesn’t
do. I have no answers, announcements, or even plans at this point, but
if you or your company depend on WordPress, you might want to start
thinking about where to go from here.</p>

<h2 id="the-history-and-use-of-etcglob-in-early-unixes">The history and
use of /etc/glob in early Unixes</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-13, from: OS News</p>
<p>One of the innovations that the V7 Bourne shell introduced was built
in shell wildcard globbing, which is to say expanding things like *, ?,
and so on. Of course Unix had shell wildcards well before V7, but in V6
and earlier, the shell didn’t implement globbing itself; instead this
was delegated to an external program, /etc/glob (this affects things
like looking into the history of Unix shell wildcards, because you have
to know to look at the glob source, not the shell). ↫ Chris Siebenmann I
never knew expanding wildcars in UNIX shells was once done by a separate
program, but if you stop and think about the original UNIX philosophy,
it kind of makes sense. On a slightly related note, I’m currently very
deep into setting up, playing with, and actively using HP-UX 11i v1 on
the HP c8000 I was able to buy thanks to countless donations from you
all, OSNews readers, and one of the things I want to get working is
email in dtmail, the CDE email program. However, dtmail is old, and
wants you to do email the UNIX way: instead of dtmail retrieving and
sending email itself, it expects other programs to those tasks for you.
In other words, to setup and use dtmail (instead of relying on a 2010
port of Thunderbird), I’ll have to learn how to set up things like
sendmail, fetchmail, or alternatives to those tools. Those programs will
in turn dump the emails in the maildir format for dtmail to work with.
Configuring these tools could very well be above my paygrade, but I’ll
do my best to try and get it working – I think it’s more authentic to
use something like dtmail than a random Thunderbird port. In any event,
this, too, feels very UNIX-y, much like delegating wildcard expansion to
a separate program. What this also shows is that the “UNIX philosophy”
was subject to erosion from the very beginning, and really isn’t a
modern phenomenon like many people seem to imply. I doubt many of the
people complaining about the demise of the UNIX philosophy today even
knew wildcard expansion used to be done by a separate program.</p>
