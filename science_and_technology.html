<h2 id="the-insanity-of-being-a-software-engineer">The insanity of being
a software engineer</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>Software gets more complicated. All of this complexity is there for a
reason. But what happened to specializing? When a house is being built,
tons of people are involved: architects, civil engineers, plumbers,
electricians, bricklayers, interior designers, roofers, surveyors,
pavers, you name it. You don’t expect a single person, or even a whole
single company, to be able to do all of those. ↫ Vitor M. de Sousa
Pereira I’ve always found that software development gets a ton of
special treatment and leeway in quality expectations, and this has
allowed the kind of stuff the linked article is writing about to become
the norm. Corporations can demand so much from developers and
programmers to the point where expecting quality is wholly unreasonable,
because there’s basically no consequences for delivering a shit product.
Bugs, crashes, security issues, lack of documentation, horrid
localisation – it’s all par for the course in software, yet we would not
tolerate any of that in almost any other type of product. While I’m sure
some of this can be attributed to developers themselves, most of it
seems to stem from incompetent managers imposing impossible deadlines
downwards and setting unrealistic expectations upwards – you know, kick
down, lick up – creating a perfect storm of incompetence. We all know
it, we all experience it every day, and we all hate it – but we’ve just
accepted it. As consumers, as developers, as regulatory bodies. It’s too
late to fix this now. Software development will forever exist as a sort
of no man’s land of quality expectations, free from regulations,
warranties, and consumer protections, and imposing them now after the
fact is never going to be accepted by the industry and won’t ever make
it through any lawmaking process of any country, and we all suffer from
it, both as users of software and as makers of it.</p>

<h2 id="apples-darwin-os-and-xnu-kernel-deep-dive">Apple’s Darwin OS and
XNU kernel deep dive</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>Apple’s Darwin operating system is the Unix-like core underpinning
macOS, iOS, and all of Apple’s modern OS platforms. At its heart lies
the XNU kernel – an acronym humorously standing for “X is Not Unix.” XNU
is a unique hybrid kernel that combines a Mach microkernel core with
components of BSD Unix. This design inherits the rich legacy of Mach
(originating from 1980s microkernel research) and the robust stability
and POSIX compliance of BSD. The result is a kernel architecture that
balances modularity and performance by blending microkernel
message-passing techniques with a monolithic Unix kernel structure.
We’ll go through a chronological exploration of Darwin and XNU’s
evolution – from Mach and BSD origins to the modern kernel features in
macOS on Apple Silicon and iOS on iPhones. We’ll follow this with a deep
dive into the architectural milestones, analyze XNU’s internal design
(Mach-BSD interaction, IPC, scheduling, memory management,
virtualization), and examine how the kernel and key user-space
components have adapted to new devices and requirements over time. ↫
Tanuj Ravi Rao Despite its popularity and open source kernel, it’s quite
rare to see detailed deep-dives into the underpinnings of macOS. It
always surprised me that nobody took whatever Apple threw across the
fence every macOS release and ran with it – much further than “run
existing open source desktops but worse” we never got when it comes to
Darwin distributions (although this might change) – so perhaps having
more approachable articles like these out and about get people
interested.</p>

<p>date: 2025-04-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>This is a very small blog post about my first reverse engineering
project, in which I don’t really reverse engineer anything yet, but I am
just getting started! A family member asked me to add additional book
data to the LeapStart he bought for his son, this is the starting point
here. ↫ leloubil’s blog We’ve all seen toy, child-focused computers like
these, and I always find them deeply fascinating. I’m not buying them
for my own kids – they’ll get their start on a “real” computer I’ll set
up for them to explore and break – but I see their value, and they’re
probably a better choice than giving a kid a tablet or whatever (which
my wife and I are opposed to for our kids). What fascinates me about
them is, of course, what software, and more specifically, what operating
system they run. It turns out this one most likely runs on something
called µC/OS-II, one of the many relatively obscure embedded operating
systems you never hear about. µC/OS is a full-featured embedded
operating system originally developed by Micriµm. In addition to the two
highly popular kernels, µC/OS features support for TCP/IP, USB-Device,
USB-Host, and Modbus, as well as a robust File System. ↫ µC/OS GitHub

capabilities, so if you’re interested in learning more, that’s your
