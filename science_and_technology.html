The developer of MartyPC, an emulator for vintage Intel-compatible
hardware that targets cycle accuracy, has released a test suite for
Intel's classic 80286 processor and compatibles – created, in a fit of
raw enthusiasm and hyperfocus, by single-stepping a physical chip from
the mid-1980s through the execution of almost 1.5 million instructions.…

<p>Microsoft wants to know why, exactly, Windows 11 is slow, so it’s
adding a feature in the latest Insider Preview to collect data when a
Windows 11 machine is experiencing slowness or sluggishness. As part of
our commitment to improving Windows performance, logs are now collected
when your PC has experienced any slow or sluggish performance. Windows
Insiders are encouraged to provide feedback when experiencing PC issues
related to slow or sluggish performance, allowing Feedback Hub to
automatically collect these logs, which will help us root cause issues
faster. Use the Desktop &gt; System Sluggishness category when filing
feedback to allow Feedback Hub to automatically pick up these logs.
These logs are stored locally (%systemRoot%folder) and only sent to
Microsoft via Feedback Hub when feedback is submitted. ↫ Amanda
Langowski and Brandon LeBlanc In case you want to solve performance
problems with Windows 11, just go here and follow the steps, and your
computer will be spry as a Spring chicken in a few minutes. I am very

about a mere 20 lines of code which provide the absolute barest possible

smallest, actually usable window manager I know about. Even TinyWM is
twice as large. However, it doesn’t let you launch programs, or assign
key bindings. mwm does. ↫ Mwm’s GitHub page It will open a window, and
let you switch between windows, that are always fullscreen. No
titlebars, no virtual desktops, no menus, no nothing. This is the true
minimalist’s experience.</p>

<h2 id="an-artificially-complex-xml-schema-as-a-lock-in-tool">An
artificially complex XML schema as a lock-in tool</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-21, from: OS News</p>
<p>The Document Foundation, which developers LibreOffice, is mad at
Microsoft for the levels of complexity in the Microsoft 365 document
format. They claim Microsoft intentionally makes this format’s XML
schema as complex and obtuse as possible to lock users into the
Microsoft Office ecosystem. This artificial complexity is characterised
by a deeply nested tag structure with excessive abstraction, dozens or
even hundreds of optional or overloaded elements, non-intuitive naming
conventions, the widespread use of extension points and wildcards, the
multiple import of namespaces and type hierarchies, and sparse or
cryptic documentation. In the case of the Microsoft 365 document format,
the only characteristic not present is sparse or cryptic documentation,
given that we are talking about a set of documents totalling over 8,000
pages. All the other characteristics are present to a greater or lesser
extent, making life almost impossible for a developer trying to
implement the schema. ↫ Italo Vignoli I feel like this was widely known
already, since I distinctly remember the discussions around the
standardisation process for the Office Open XML file formats. Then, too,
it was claimed that Microsoft’s then-new XML file formats were far more
complex and obtuse than the existing, already standardised OpenDocument
file formats, and that there was no need to push Microsoft’s new file
formats through the process. These days, you might wonder how relevant
all of this still is, but considering vast swaths of the private,
corporate, government, and academic world still run on Microsoft Office
and its default file formats, it’s definitely still a hugely relevant
matter. As an office suite, you are basically required to support Office
Open XML, and if Microsoft is making that more complex and obtuse on
purpose, that’s a form of monopoly abuse that should be addressed.</p>
