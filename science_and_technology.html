id="google-is-a-monopolist-in-online-advertising-tech-judge-says">Google
is a monopolist in online advertising tech, judge says</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>Google acted illegally to maintain a monopoly in some online
advertising technology, a federal judge ruled on Thursday, adding to
legal troubles that could reshape the $1.86 trillion company and alter
its power over the internet. Judge Leonie Brinkema of the U.S. District
Court for the Eastern District of Virginia said in a 115-page ruling
that Google had broken the law to build its dominance over the largely
invisible system of technology that places advertisements on pages
across the web. The Justice Department and a group of states had sued
Google, arguing that its monopoly in ad technology allowed the company
to charge higher prices and take a bigger portion of each sale. ↫ David
McCabe at The New York Times Google has come under fire from all sides
in the United States, being declared an abusive monopoly in two
different court cases covering search and now online advertising. In
this case, Google controls 87% of the online advertising market in the
US, which clearly confers monopoly power onto the company. No actual
remedies have been proposed yet in this case, though, but breaking up
the company is on the table. Google isn’t the only company facing
antitrust court cases in the US, as Amazon and Apple, too, have the US
government breathing down their necks. All three of these companies have
overtly been trying to buy the favour of the new regime in Washington,
but so far, without any success. I doubt we’ll get as far as a breakup,
but I definitely think that’s the only real way we’ll ever get proper
market forces at work again in the technology market. Not that any of us
are really “consumers” in this online ad business, but of course,
monopoly pricing still affects us through higher prices for the goods
being advertised. If companies are forced to accept Google’s higher
pricing for online ads, those costs will definitely be offloaded to
consumers. As such, even breaking up a monopoly that doesn’t seem to
affect us personally can still improve our lives by lowering prices.</p>

<p>date: 2025-04-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>ActiveX is a powerful technology that enables rich interactions
within Microsoft 365 applications, but its deep access to system
resources also increases security risks. Starting this month, the
Windows versions of Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft
PowerPoint, and Microsoft Visio will have a new default configuration
for ActiveX controls: Disable all controls without notification. ↫ Zaeem
Patel at the Microsoft 365 Insider Blog Be honest: did any of you know
ActiveX was still a thing? Heck, when was the last time you even thought
of ActiveX? This technology acted a replacement for Windows’ COM and OLE
2.0, and was used to make controls in a whole slew of Microsoft
applications. ActiveX controls from one application could also be
embedded into another, like showing a toolbar from Word inside an image
editor. ActiveX has several major downsides, the two biggest of which
are its relative lack of portability, and most of all, its atrocious
security record. I’m genuinely surprised it’s taken them this long to
actively, fully disable the technology by default.</p>

<h2 id="a-threat-model-for-opposing-authoritarianism">A threat model for
opposing authoritarianism</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>A decade ago, I published a book on privacy “Dragnet Nation: A Quest
for Privacy, Security, and Freedom in a World of Relentless
Surveillance.” In the book, and since then, in articles and speeches, I
have been dispensing advice to people on how to protect their privacy.
But my advice did not envision the moment we are in – where the
government would collaborate with a tech CEO to strip-mine all of our
data from government databases and use it to pursue political enemies.
In the parlance of cybersecurity, I had the wrong “threat model,” which
is a fancy way of describing the risks I was seeking to mitigate. I had
not considered that the United States might be swept into the rising
tide of what scholars call “competitive authoritarianism” –
authoritarian regimes that retain some of the trappings of democracy,
such as elections, but use the power of the state to crush any
meaningful dissent. ↫ Julia Angwin Democracy is not nearly as much of a
given as many people think, and in this day and age, where massive
amounts of Americans’ data and personal information are collected and
stored by the very corporations supporting the Trump regime, Americans
have to think very differently about where digital threats actually come
from. Nothing protects any American – or anyone visiting America – from
ending up in an El Salvadorian concentration camp. Plan accordingly.</p>

In 2022, the UK's tax collector put £4.5 billion ($5.9 billion) on the
table to help its applications become "less dependent upon legacy
technologies." The extent to which His Majesty's Revenue &amp; Customs
(HMRC) achieved that goal is debatable, but there is no doubt it intends
to spend up to £5.2 billion ($6.9 billion) more to continue the job.…

<h2 id="fedora-42-released">Fedora 42 released</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>Fedora 42 has been released, bringing with it a major policy change:
the Fedora KDE version now has the same status as the GNOME version.
This means that Fedora KDE will be getting the same promotion, website
space, and potential blocker status as the GNOME version. For now, the
naming is a bit weird – Fedora Workstation for GNOME, Fedora KDE Plasma
Desktop for KDE – but they intend to fix this down the line. Feodra 42
also brings with it a brand new installation interface, which replaces
the old one with a newer, step-by-step wizard-style interface. Anaconda
is now also a native Wayland application, instead of running in Xorg.
This release also marks the official availability of the Fedora COSMIC
spin, bringing System76’s Rust-based COSMIC desktop on the same footing
as Xfce, LXQt, and others. Another cool addition is FEX for those of us
running Fedora on ARM. Fedora now provides FEX, a fast emulator that
allows one to run x86 and x86-64 binaries on an AArch64 Linux host. FEX
requires a number of supporting components, including a RootFS image,
and integration with muvm to support 16k page-size hosts. The purpose of
this Change is to integrate FEX itself and its supporting components
into Fedora Linux, to provide a delightful out-of-box experience for
users that want to run x86 and x86-64 binaries on their aarch64 systems.
This also includes integration into the AArch64 Fedora KDE spin as a
non-blocking component of the spin. ↫ Fedora 42 release notes You can
download and install Fedora 42, or if you’re already a Fedora user, you
can upgrade through your graphical update utility or the command line
using DNF.</p>

id="whiskey-developer-throws-in-the-towel-suggests-to-just-buy-crossover-instead">Whiskey
developer throws in the towel, suggests to just buy CrossOver
instead</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>Isaac Marovitz, the developer of Whiskey, a frontend for Apple’s Game
Porting Toolkit and Wine, has decided to throw in the towel. The
developer is advising users to buy CrossOver instead, which provides the
same service. The reasoning behind their decision seems sound, and are
actually quite noble and considerate. First and foremost, it’s the usual
problem lone developers run into: they lost interest in the project, and
to make matters worse, they’re only a student and simply lack the time
to keep working on a project they’re simply not really into anymore.
Running a complicated project like this on your own, unpaid, while also
having to study is hard at the best of times, and if you’re also not
interested in it anymore it quickly becomes a massive burden. The second
reason is that originally, Whiskey was just supposed to be a frontend
for Wine on the Mac, without actually making any changes to Wine itself.
The release of Apple’s Game Porting Toolkit changed the game, though,
and all of a sudden Whiskey ended up shipping not just a nice frontend,
but also custom versions of Wine. Marovitz states he doesn’t have the
required knowledge and expertise to work on Wine, and as such, can’t
contribute back to Wine and CrossOver, which feels bad. By contrast,
Whisky is based on CrossOver, but we don’t produce any bespoke fixes. I,
quite frankly, do not have the requisite skills or time to do so. As a
result, the amount that Whisky as a whole contributes to Wine is
practically zero. This is not a fair trade, and continuing this
parasitic relationship could easily harm CrossOver’s continued
profitability and the existence of Wine on Mac as a whole. ↫ Isaac
Marovitz Wine, of course, has a ton of funding behind it these days,
especially from Valve, but Valve’s interest lies solely and exclusively
on Linux. While all of Valve’s funds and the work of Wine developers
does benefit the Mac, much of the Wine on Mac work is done by CrossOver.
I find it incredibly honest and respectful of Marovitz to make it clear
he doesn’t want to leech off other people’s work without providing
anything in return. So, Whiskey is no more, but for the few Mac users
who want to play Windows games on their Mac, CrossOver exists as a
refuge that should work just fine.</p>

<h2 id="fedora-change-aims-for-99-package-reproducibility">Fedora change
aims for 99% package reproducibility</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-14, from: OS News</p>
<p>The effort to ensure that open-source software is reproducible has
been gathering steam over the years, and gaining traction with major
Linux distributions. Debian, for example, has been working toward
reproducible builds for more than a decade; it can now produce official
live CDs of the current stable release that are reproducible. Fedora
started on the path much later, but it has progressed far enough that
the project is now considering a change proposal for the Fedora 43
development cycle, expected to be released in October, with a goal of
making 99% of Fedora’s package builds reproducible. So far, reaction to
the proposal seems favorable and focused primarily on how to achieve the
goal—with minimal pain for packagers—rather than whether to attempt it.
↫ Joe Brockmeier at LWN.net In the case of individual packages,
reproducibility means that if you set up a build environment at home
according to Fedora’s specifications, you can create an exact,
bit-by-bit identical copy of a package. This is important because it can
help detect and guard against supply chain attacks like the infamous xz
backdoor attempt that was thwarted only by mere luck. As the LWN article
notes, however, it’s impossible for Fedora to achieve the original
“bit-by-bit” part of the definition because of how RPMs are built. RPMs
include the signature inside the RPM, and a few other metadata bits are
problematic as well. The actual contents of an RPM – the thing you
actually install, run, and use – meet the definition of “bit-by-bit”,
though. By this point, Fedora has pretty much done all it can through
its own infrastructure when it comes to reproducibility, which has
brought the project to 90% of packages being reproducible. It’s going to
be up to the individual package maintainers and software developers to
get to the desired goal of 99% by Fedora 43, though. To ensure package
maintainers take this issue seriously, a change proposal has been
proposed to treat reproducibility issues as bugs, with a degree of
wiggle room for now (think should instead of must). It’s only a proposal
for now, but it’s looking like it will make it. The excellent – as
always – LWN article has a lot more detail about both the proposes
changes as well as the various points of view.</p>

<h2 id="i-bought-a-mac">“I bought a Mac”</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-14, from: OS News</p>
<p>Yep. I regret to inform you all that, as of January 2025, I am a Mac
user: I bought a Mac. I have betrayed the penguin. So, how did such an
icon of early 2000s Apple fall into my grubby hands? Well, it all
started with the Wii U. I’m not joking. ↫ Loganius That’s one heck of an
excuse to get a PowerPC G4 – needing to do Linux kvm hacking to fix a
bug. While getting the PowerMac G4 they bought all set up and working
properly for development purposes, someone else fixed the bug in
question in the meantime. Such is the way of open source development.
Regardless, as far as classic computers go, PowerPC Macs are a great way
to enter the wider hobby of retrocomputing. They’re widely available,
incredibly cheap, and offer a ton of variety when it comes to supported
operating systems, working with everything from classic Mac OS to Mac OS
X, from Linux to the BSDs, down to more exotic awesome stuff like
MorphOS. Their popularity also ensures a steady stream of replacement
parts, expertise, and community support. I have a 1.25Ghz 17″ PowerBook
G4 for MorphOS, and a snow white iBook G3 for Mac OS 9.2.2, and I’ll
never get rid of them.</p>

Objective-C</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-14, from: OS News</p>
<p>To argue that Objective-C resembles a metaphysically divine language,
or even a good language, is like saying Shakespeare is best appreciated
in pig latin. Objective-C is, at best, polarizing. Ridiculed for its
unrelenting verbosity and peculiar square brackets, it is used only for
building Mac and iPhone apps and would have faded into obscurity in the
early 1990s had it not been for an unlikely quirk of history.
Nevertheless, in my time working as a software engineer in San Francisco
in the early 2010s, I repeatedly found myself at dive bars in SoMa or in
the comments of HackerNews defending its most cumbersome design choices.

<h2 id="pinta-3.0-brings-major-gtk4-overhaul">Pinta 3.0 brings major
GTK4 overhaul</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-12, from: OS News</p>
<p>Over 15 years ago, I wrote about the launch of a Paint.NET clone for
Linux, called Pinta, written in GTK. That was merely version 0.1, and
over time, it’s become somewhat of a staple for many Linux users. The
project just released version 3, which is a major revision, moving the
application over to GTK4 and Libadwaita. Built on the robust GTK 4
toolkit and the sleek Libadwaita, Pinta 3.0 brings a redesigned user
interface that’s faster, more responsive, and more efficient than ever.
Linux users will also benefit from improved system utility integration.
On top of all this, new effects and the return of add-ins—previously
disabled due to technical constraints—promise to bring even more
creative possibilities. ↫ Pinta 3.0 release announcement Aside from the
new user interface and return of add-ins, virtually every aspect of the
application seems to have been touched in one way or another. We’ve got
improved performance for both the UI and the application’s
functionality, better gesture and touch support, redesigned and adaptive
toolboxes, improved keyboard support, new effects, and much, much more.
Like its original inspiration Paint.NET, Pinta sits between a basic
image editor like Microsoft Paint and much more advanced tools like
Photoshop and GIMP, and it seems this new release sticks to that
position in the market. You can download Pinta 3.0 for Linux, Windows,
and macOS, and it will surely find its way to your distribution’s
repository soon enough.</p>

<p>One thing I love about Python is how it comes with its very own
built-in zen. In moments of tribulations, when I am wrestling with
crooked code and tangled thoughts, I often find solace in its timeless
wisdom. ↫ Susam Pal I can’t program and know nothing about Python, but
this still made me laugh.</p>
