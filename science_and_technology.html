id="microsoft-cancels-a-windows-11-variant-youve-most-likely-forgotten-exists">Microsoft
cancels a Windows 11 variant you’ve most likely forgotten exists</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-01, from: OS News</p>
<p>If there’s one thing Microsoft is good at, it’s creating weird
variants of Windows with odd names that tech media talk about for like a
day, after which everyone, especially Microsoft, forgets they even
exist. Usually, these weird Windows variants are the result of either
legal requirements, or, more commonly, of perceived threats to Windows’
dominance on the desktop. An example of the former are the various “N”
editions of Windows, while an example of the latter is the one we’re
talking about today: Windows 11 SE. I honestly had completely forgotten
Windows 11 SE existed, and most likely you did, too. Windows 11 SE was
(one of) Microsoft’s response(s) to the growing popularity of
Chromebooks in schools, and as such, this Windows variant omitted a
bunch of features for performance and distraction reasons, stored files
in OneDrive instead of locally, was locked down so only administrators
could control which applications could be used, and so on. In fact,
unless specifically whitelisted, Windows 11 SE would not run any Win32
or UWP applications – everything had to be either a PWA or a website.
Notably, it was only available in combination with a few specific
devices. The past tense in the preceding paragraph should be a dead
giveaway of what’s happening. Yes, Microsoft just cancelled the whole
thing, after being on the market for only a few years. Microsoft will
not release a feature update after Windows 11 SE, version 24H2. Support
for Windows 11 SE—including software updates, technical assistance, and
security fixes—will end in October 2026. While your device will continue
to work, we recommend transitioning to a device that supports another
edition of Windows 11 to ensure continued support and security. ↫
Windows 11 SE support document In other words, if your school fell for
Microsoft’s sales pitch for Windows 11 SE, you’re kind of screwed after
October 2026, because Windows 11 SE only shipped on specific, low-cost,
low-powered devices. You’d think other variants of Windows 11 will more
or less run on those, too, but if not – or far too slowly – your school
is now sitting on a pile of e-waste. Anybody want to run a betting pool
for the Windows variant Microsoft will cancel next?</p>

<h2 id="hello-world-in-bismuth">“Hello world” in Bismuth</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-01, from: OS News</p>
<p>Late last year, we talked about Bismuth, a virtual machine being
developed by Eniko Fox, one of the developers of the awesome game
Kitsune Tails. Part of a operating systems development side project,
Bismuth is a VM (think Java Virtual Machine, not VMware) on top of Fox’
custom kernel, designed specifically to run programs in a sandbox. The
first article detailed the origins of Bismuth, and the second article
delved into memory safety, sandboxing, and more. We’re a few months down
the line now, and Fox recently published another article in the series,
this time explaining how a hello world-program works in Bismuth. This is
the third in a series of posts about a virtual machine I’m developing as
a hobby project called Bismuth. I’ve talked a lot about Bismuth, mostly
on social media, but I don’t think I’ve done a good job at communicating
how you go from some code to a program in this VM. In this post I aim to
rectify that by walking you through the entire life cycle of a hello
world Bismuth program, from the highest level to the lowest. ↫ Eniko Fox
There’s a ton of detail here, and at the end you’ll have a pretty solid
grip on how Bismuth works.</p>

tried Servo, the undercover web browser engine made with Rust”</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-01, from: OS News</p>
<p>Servo is unique for a few other reasons, too. It’s managed by
the Linux Foundation Europe with decisions made by a technical steering
committee, not a big tech company. One of the main goals is to be an
“embeddable web rendering engine,” meaning it’s not just for browsers—it
could be a replacement for Electron or the Android WebView. Servo is
also the first completely new browser engine in decades, so it’s taking
lessons learned from mainstream browsers while building a new
foundation. ↫ Corbin Davenport At the moment, as Davenport notes, Servo
is far from ready to be a daily driver browser engine. Tons of websites’
rendering is broken and some crash the browser altogether, and
performance is nowhere near that of the other browser engines. This
makes perfect sense, as Servo is still in heavy development, and there’s
no massive corporation with endless money (and ulterior motives) backing
it. Still, out of all the various attempts at wrestling control away
from Blink and WebKit, I feel like Servo’s the one with the most promise
in the long term.</p>

id="kyvos-gui-frontend-for-easy-amigaos-4-and-morphos-emulation-using-qemu">Kyvos:
GUI frontend for easy AmigaOS 4 and MorphOS emulation using Qemu</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-31, from: OS News</p>
<p>Getting hardware to run AmigaOS 4.1 or MorphOS on isn’t always easy,
cheap, or even possible in the first place. Luckily, there’s now an
incredibly easy and straightforward way to emulate these two operating
systems: Kyvos, developed by George Sokianos. Kyvos is a user-friendly
frontend for Qemu, designed to streamline the creation of AmigaOS 4 and
MorphOS emulated environments on Linux, macOS, and Windows. Pronounced
“kee-vos,” this name is inspired by the Greek word “κύβος,” meaning
cube, symbolizing these virtual systems running within the host OS.
Setting up an AmigaOS 4 or MorphOS system is effortless with Kyvos—just
a few clicks, and you’re ready to go. A helpful wizard guides users in
locating or downloading necessary dependencies, including Qemu and 7zip
binaries. ↫ George Sokianos Of course, nothing is stopping you from
following guides online to build your own Qemu virtual machine and
associated complex command to start it, but Kyvos takes all that work
out of your hands and makes it incredibly easy, all wrapped in a nice
graphical user interface. It’s available for Linux, Windows, and macOS.
All you need is Kyvos – which is free, but Ko-Fi donations are
appreciated – and a copy of either AmigaOS 4.1 Final Edition or MorphOS.
Based on a toot by Hyperion, the developers of AmigaOS 4.1, you need the
version for the AmigaOne board specifically, which will set you back
about €30 for a boxed copy (I’ve asked if there are any download
versions for sale as well). A copy of MorphOS costs about €79, and can
be bought from inside MorphOS after installation. Note that you can also
use MorphOS without a license, but it will slow down its performance
after about 30 minutes until you reboot. I’m stoked to try this out, as
I’ve been wanting to review both of these operating systems again, since
my previous reviews of Amiga OS 4 (from 2009) and MorphOS (also from
2009) are horribly outdated at this point. MorphOS on old Apple PowerPC
hardware just doesn’t cut it – believe me, I’ve tried – and AmigaOS 4
hardware is quite expensive and outdated at this point. Until – and
let’s face it, if – the Mirari comes out, easy emulation through Qemu
might be an option.</p>

extends Windows 10 support for RTX GPUs by one year</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-31, from: OS News</p>
<p>Stuck at the bottom of NVIDIA’s announcement of its latest graphics
driver update is a section about the company’s plan for Windows 10
support. As we all know, Windows 10 will become end-of-life in October
of this year, and like so many others, NVIDIA needs to deal with this.
Before we get to Windows 10, though, NVIDIA also reminds users that a
few very popular GPU generations will no longer receive driver updates
after October of this year. The company notes that GPUs based on the
Maxwell, Pascal, and Volta architectures will Game Ready Driver in
October 2025, after which they’ll only get quarterly security updates
for another three years. These three architectures roughly correspond to
the GeForce GTX 7xx, 9xx, and 10xx series and their mobile counterparts,
as well as a few other higher-end cards from the same generations. The
full list is available to see if your GPU will receive its last driver
update in a few months. As for Windows 10 support, the company notes:
Also, we’re extending Windows 10 Game Ready Driver support for all
GeForce RTX GPUs to October 2026, a year beyond the operating system’s
end-of-life, to ensure users continue to receive the latest day-0
optimizations for new games and apps. ↫ Andrew Burnes at nvidia.com
Considering half of Windows users are still using Windows 10, this is
probably the correct policy by NVIDIA. Ideally this support would last
even longer than just that one year, but with a company like NVIDIA you
kind of have to take what you can get, because generous they are
not.</p>

<p>BlueOS kernel is written in Rust, featuring security, lightweight,

Rust’s standard library. ↫ BlueOS kernel GitHub page This is the kernel
for the BlueOS operating system, developed by Vivo, a Chinese consumer
electronics company. Sadly, all of the websites and documentation for
BlueOS are written in Mandarin, making it virtually impossible to really
get a grip on what they’re developing, and I certainly don’t trust
Google Translate or whatever enough to give me a proper, trustworthy,
and accurate translation. I hope the company either hires some
translators, or perhaps enthusiasts with the right skillset can provide
some more insight over the coming years. It seems similar to Huawei’s
HarmonyOS Next, and it’s apparently shipping on one of Vivo’s
smartwatches.</p>

<p>Last week-end, I was invited to the UNIX Social Camp in Dijon,
France to talk about the reasons I still use OpenBSD these days and why
should others do so; or at least, have a look at OpenBSD. ↫ Joel Carnat
Here’s my short pitch as to why you should use OpenBSD: it’s the closest
you’ll get to a traditional, classic UNIX, while still using a modern
and maintained operating system. OpenBSD just makes sense, and every
time I run into some issue or I want to know how something in OpenBSD
works, the answers always make me go “well that makes sense”. That’s
rare in modern computing, and we need to cherish it.</p>

clicks their heels once more, allows hate-speech on LinkedIn</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-30, from: OS News</p>
<p>Are you still using LinkedIn, the website where failed tech startup
entrepreneurs go to die and “AI” influencers try to sell you on the
latest version of the chatbot Florpium like a Utah mom trying to sell
leggings that are totally not an MLM? If you are, and the other ten
thousand reasons not to use the website incarnation of an ad for a
personal injury lawyer along I-11 in Henderson, Nevada, weren’t enough,
Microsoft just handed you another one.
LinkedIn removed transgender-related protections from its policy on
hateful and derogatory content. The platform no longer lists
“misgendering or deadnaming of transgender individuals” as examples of
prohibited conduct. While “content that attacks, denigrates,
intimidates, dehumanizes, incites or threatens hatred, violence,
prejudicial or discriminatory action” is still considered hateful,
addressing a person by a gender and name they ask not be designated by
is not anymore. Similarly, the platform removed “race or gender
identity” from its examples of inherent traits for which negative
comments are considered harassment. That qualification of harassment is
now kept only for behaviour that is actively “disparaging another
member’s perceived gender”, not mentioning race or gender identity
anymore. ↫ Matti Schneider at the Open Terms Archive Microsoft joined
the chorus of pathetic, spineless US tech companies bowing to far-right
extremism long ago, and this is just another sign that Microsoft, like
so many other US tech companies, is pulling an IBM. They did learn from
the best, after all, and it doesn’t surprise me one bit that all of
these CEOs click their heels like the good little brownshirts that they
are. Anyway, LinkedIn has no value to anyone with even a gram of
self-respect, and Microsoft’s other products are such utter trash they
basically have to make you upgrade at the barrel of a gun. For those
using their products – do you hate yourself that much? You deserve so
much more.</p>

<p>Adjusted for the inevitable progress of time, the Common Desktop
Environment or CDE is the best desktop environment of all time, and no,
I will not be taking question at this time. OpenBSD wasn’t yet graced by
CDE’s presence, but this is currently changing as the first commit for
porting CDE to OpenBSD has appeared. It’s still rough around the edges
and very slightly tested. I wouldn’t use is as a daily driver, it’s old
unsecure code but it’s fun if you want to bring back memories. ↫ Antoine
at the openbsd-ports mailing list On top of that, this being the initial
commit also means there’s probably bugs and other issues lurking in the
code, so caution is definitely advised.</p>

id="microsoft-finally-standardises-cpu-usage-reporting-in-task-manager">Microsoft
finally standardises CPU usage reporting in Task Manager</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-30, from: OS News</p>
<p>Microsoft is finally changing the way Task Manager reports CPU
utilisation to make it consistent across the different tabs. So
apparently this has been gradually rolling out to the 34 different
Windows 11 beta dev preview testing alpha release candidate service pack
4 channels since early this year, but then stopped the roll-out to fix
some issues. These issues seem fixed now, as the roll-out restarted this
week. It”s an important change that I think y’all will care about. From
the original announcement of the change back in February: We are
beginning to roll out a change to the way Task Manager calculates CPU
utilization for the Processes, Performance, and Users pages. Task
Manager will now use the standard metrics to display CPU workload
consistently across all pages and aligning with industry standards and
third-party tools. For backward compatibility, a new optional column
called CPU Utility is available (hidden by default) on the Details tab
showing the previous CPU value used on the Processes page. ↫ Amanda
Langowski and Brandon LeBlanc at the Windows Blogs Before this change,
Task Manager’s Processes tab didn’t take the number of processor cores
into account when calculating PCU usage, so you could see a process at
100% CPU usage even if it was only using one core. These new changes
standardise CPU usage reporting across all tabs, taking the number of
CPU cores into account properly. Rejoice.</p>

<h2 id="why-risc-v-linux-needs-everyone-upstream">Why RISC-V Linux needs
everyone upstream</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-30, from: OS News</p>
<p>RISC-V has been supported in the upstream Linux kernel since 2017.
But without a common hardware baseline, ensuring compatibility across
builds and distros hasn’t been easy. The ecosystem was in need of a
compelling, clearly defined hardware target – something both software
and hardware teams could rally around to produce silicon capable of
running stable, enterprise-grade software. This target arrived in
October 2024 with the ratification of the application-class RVA23
Profile – RISC-V-speak for a baseline configuration, similar to
microarchitecture feature levels in x86. The culmination of years of
progress, RVA23 brings together the work done to shape the ISA and
standardize key extensions such as vector, bit manipulation and
hypervisor. ↫ James De Vile at RISC-V International’s blog Such a
standard, stable baseline is incredibly welcome, and RISC-V working to
have everything part of the upstream Linux kernel is crucial. Having to
deal with out-of-tree patches and drivers and specific builds for
specific boards is a nightmare – look at Linux on ARM – and hinders
adoption of RISC-V.</p>

id="the-eus-age-verification-application-requires-a-google-or-apple-account-and-google-approved-android-device-or-iphone">The
EU’s age-verification application requires a Google or Apple account and
Google-approved Android device or iPhone</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>The European Union is in the process of testing an age-verification
application, which people can use to verify their age in a
privacy-preserving manner (in theory, of course). There’s countless
important discussions to be had about whether or not age verification,
privacy-preserving or not, is even something we should want, but that’s
a topic for another time and for people smarter than I. For now, several
member states are currently testing the application on a voluntary
basis, and the application itself is open source, with the code hosted
on GitHub. Aside from the obvious concerns about just how private such
an application can even be, and concerns about whether or not we should
even want something like this, there’s another major problem: the
application intends to make use of and require application and device
verification by using the proprietary tools for such functionality from
Google and Apple, built into Android and iOS, respectively. Listed as
future “features”: App and device verification based on Google Play
Integrity API and Apple App Attestation ↫ The application’s GitHub page
This is a massive problem. For reasons that should be obvious to anyone
with at least six functioning neurons, the European Union, as well as
countless other countries, are trying to reduce their dependency on US
technology companies. As such, it’s indefensible to then require anyone
who needs to use age verification in the European Union to use an
application that will only work on Google-approved Android devices and
even then, only when installed from the Google Play Store, with the only
alternative being, of all things, Apple’s iOS. This means that the EU
will require anyone who needs age verification to have either a Google
or an Apple account, and can only use Google-approved Android or iOS.
This application would not work on, say, GrapheneOS or any other
non-Google-approved Android ROM – in fact, even if you were to compile
the application yourself, you wouldn’t be able to actually use it
because it wouldn’t be installed from the Google Play Store. Of course,
any mobile operating other than Android or iOS need not apply either.
The danger of tying age verification to Google and Apple did not go by
unnoticed, and a GitHub issue raised the issue a few weeks ago. I would
like to strongly urge to abandon this plan. Requiring a dependency on
American tech giants for age verification further deepens the EU’s
dependency on America and the USA’s control over the internet.
Especially in the current political climate I hope I do not have to
explain how undesirable and dangerous that is. ↫ TheLastProject in the
GitHub issue The comment thread attached to the issue is long, but
during the two weeks since the issue was raised, nobody from the
application’s team has answered or even acknowledged people’s concerns,
which doesn’t exactly inspire confidence in this being taken seriously.
I just hope that with this entire project being in the early testing
phases, at least someone manages to realise tying this to Google and
Apple is one of the dumbest ideas in a long, long time.</p>

<h2 id="samsung-removes-bootloader-unlocking-with-one-ui-8">Samsung
removes bootloader unlocking with One UI 8</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>Have a Samsung phone (outside of the United States), and want to
unlock the bootloader? Well, soon you won’t be able to do so anymore, as
Samsung seems to be removing this option from their phones – including
already sold models being upgraded to One UI 8. Bootloader unlocking is
a popular way to breathe new life into older devices, by loading
unofficial software onto a device, like custom ROMs, gaining root
access, custom kernels, etc. This option will be taken away from users
with One UI 8. This means not only is the OEM Unlock not visible in
Settings anymore, but the bootloader doesn’t even contain any of the
code required to unlock itself. This means a workaround to brute force
it open is not possible at all, unless Samsung updates the bootloader to
add this logic back in. ↫ Josh Skinner at SammyGuru And so, the ongoing
process of locking down Android to a point where it becomes nigh-on
indistinguishable from iOS’ locked-down, anti-user nature continues
unabated. Samsung is the default choice for Android users in a lot of
places around the world, and seeing them, too move ever closer to fully
locking down their phones is terrible news for consumers. We should be
striving for less restrictive computing, not more. Combined with
persistent rumours that Google is looking into effectively taking
Android closed source, leaving only a stub AOSP behind, the future of
Android as an least somewhat “open” platform looks quite grim
indeed.</p>
