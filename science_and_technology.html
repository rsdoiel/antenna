<h2 id="the-wonderful-world-of-linux-package-managers">The wonderful
world of Linux package managers</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-23, from: OS News</p>
<p>One of the strong points of Linux has always been how solid the
experience of installing and managing software is. Contrarily to what
happens in the Windows and macOS world, software on Linux is obtained
through something called a package manager, a piece of software that
manages any piece of software the user installs, as well as its
dependencies, automatically. ↫ Luca Bramè at Libre.News It truly is. I
can’t imagine using any operating system that relies (almost)
exclusively on me going out to individual websites to download random
installers or disk images, all with their own unique update mechanisms I
need to keep track of, that eat up resources and interrupt my workflow.
The combination of Fedora’s repository’s with the odd Copr or Flatpak
package – all managed transparently through KDE’s Discover – is
effectively perfect. I never have to manually install anything, nor do I
ever have to rely on tarballs like back in the dark ages. Dealing with a
Windows or macOS machine is a nightmare compared to this. Managing
applications on those operating systems feels hopelessly archaic and
outdated, and I have no idea how users tolerate that kind of nonsense.
They’ve got a dozen or more updaters running in the background,
cluttering up the system tray and eating resources, or whenever they
open an application they get an annoying popup interrupting their work
to ask them to update. It’s barbaric and user-hostile, and nobody should
be dealing with that in 2025. It’s also highly unlikely things will ever
improve for Windows or macOS users, since any attempt to bolt a package
manager into them invariably fails. The official Windows and macOS
application stores have been abject failures in more ways than one, and
tools like winget are just glorified download managers that run regular
installers in silent mode – incredibly crude and only really good for
batch-downloading some installers. The Linux world is far from perfect,
but they nailed application management early on, and the competition has
basically sat still ever since.</p>

id="european-commission-apples-core-technology-fee-and-other-hurdles-are-illegal-under-the-dma">European
Commission: Apple’s ‘Core Technology Fee’ and other hurdles are illegal
under the DMA</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-23, from: OS News</p>
<p>The fines weren’t the only Digital Markets Act news coming from this
fine continent today. The European Commission also closed its
investigation into Apple’s user choice obligations under the DMA, and
while Apple has made good progress in a few areas, the EC states Apple
is still acting illegally in a variety of others. First, the good news
for Apple: the European Commission is happy with Apple’s changes
regarding browser choice, the ability to remove preinstalled iOS
applications, and the ability to change a whole bunch of default
settings that are all locked outside of the EU. These are valuable and
welcome changes, and I’m glad the European Union, the European
Parliament, and the Commission have forced Apple to become less hostile
to European consumers. Second, there’s the bad news for Apple. Under the
DMA, Apple is obligated to allow for third-party application stores, and
the ability for users to download and install applications directly from
the internet. In this area, Apple is still breaking European Union law.
The Commission takes the preliminary view that Apple failed to comply
with this obligation in view of the conditions it imposes on app (and
app store) developers. Developers wanting to use alternative app
distribution channels on iOS are disincentivised from doing so as this
requires them to opt for business terms which include a new fee (Apple’s
Core Technology Fee). Apple also introduced overly strict eligibility
requirements, hampering developers’ ability to distribute their apps
through alternative channels. Finally, Apple makes it overly burdensome
and confusing for end users to install apps when using such alternative
app distribution channels. ↫ European Commission press release This
outcome was entirely expected, and pretty much everyone – except Apple’s
PR attack dogs – knew Apple’s malicious compliance, fees, and onerous
hurdles were going to be a hard sell. I’m glad the European Commission
seems unimpressed with Trump’s sabre-rattling about the EU’s consumer
protection laws, and is continuing to whip US tech companies in line,
making sure they stop violating our consumer protection laws. Since
these are the outcomes of a preliminary investigation, Apple now has the
chance to argue its case.</p>

id="apple-fined-for-500-million-by-ec-facebook-for-200-million">Apple
fined for €500 million by EC, Facebook for €200 million</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-23, from: OS News</p>
<p>The European Commission has levied fines against both Apple and
Facebook for violating the Digital Markets Act. Apple has to pay a €500
million fine, and Facebook a €200 million fine. Apple is breaking EU law
by not allowing application developers to inform users of other offers
outside the App Store. The Commission found that Apple fails to comply
with this obligation. Due to a number of restrictions imposed by Apple,
app developers cannot fully benefit from the advantages of alternative
distribution channels outside the App Store. Similarly, consumers cannot
fully benefit from alternative and cheaper offers as Apple prevents app
developers from directly informing consumers of such offers. The company
has failed to demonstrate that these restrictions are objectively
necessary and proportionate. ↫ European Commission press release Not
only is Apple ordered to pay the €500 million fine, they also have to
remove any and all of the illegal restrictions they put in place.
Facebook, meanwhile, was fined for not offering an equally functional
services but without combining user data from different services. The
company did offer a choice between paying and not paying – whereby the
latter involved data collection and combination – but this model
violated the DMA. The Commission found that this model is not compliant
with the DMA, as it did not give users the required specific choice to
opt for a service that uses less of their personal data but is otherwise
equivalent to the ‘personalised ads’ service. Meta’s model also did not
allow users to exercise their right to freely consent to the combination
of their personal data. ↫ European Commission press release Facebook did
later amend their model to make it compliant with the DMA, and so the
fine only covers the few months Facebook was violating EU law. Fun
additional note: the EC also mentions that the Facebook Marketplace is
no longer a gatekeeper service under the DMA, since its user numbers has
dropped below the threshold. Facebook seems to be having some engagement
issues in Europe, and you love to hear it. Both companies are required
to pay and comply within 60 days, or further periodic penalty payments
will be levied.</p>

thousands of software packages are tested and distributed through these
projects, and various community distributions. ↫ Elizabeth K. Joseph at
the IBM community website Various Linux distributions are available for
the s390x architecture, but physical access to such hardware from IBM
is, of course, relatively limited. As such, it’s great that IBM tests a
variety of open source packages for Linux on s390x, and details the
results. If you go to this table, you’ll find the detailed list of
tested packages, which mostly focuses on development and enterprise
software. IBM also offers virtual machine access to s390x hardware, and
you can get such access for free for 120 days, allowing you to test Red
Hat, SUSE, and Ubuntu on IBM Z and IBM LinuxONE. This could definitely
make for a fun weekend project to mess around with.</p>

id="the-mysterious-inetpub-folder-is-actually-a-crucial-part-of-a-windows-security-fix">The
mysterious inetpub folder is actually a crucial part of a Windows
security fix</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-22, from: OS News</p>
<p>Remember the odd inetpub folder that seemingly randomly appeared on
people’s root drives after installing a Windows 11 update? Everybody
assumed it was something left over from an update script, and that the
folder was safe to remove. Well, it turns out that’s not the case, as
the empty folder is actually a crucial part of a security fix for a
serious vulnerability. Initially undocumented in the official release
notes, the empty and seemingly inactive inetpub folder led to user
speculation about whether it was a leftover artifact from development or
a bug. Microsoft has since clarified that the folder is intentional and
part of a critical security improvement. The change addresses
CVE-2025-21204, a vulnerability that allowed local attackers to exploit
symbolic link (symlink) attacks via Windows Update, potentially granting
unauthorized access to protected system files or directories. As part of
the fix, the system pre-creates certain directories — including C:— to
harden the update process and mitigate such attacks. ↫ Cyberdom If
you’ve already removed the folder, you can reinstall the April 2025
cumulative update to restore the folder, or you can wait for next
month’s update roll-up, which will also restore the folder. This lone,
empty folder at your Windows PC’s root is apparently a crucial part of
the security of your computer, but since it took Microsoft a while to
publish release notes, nobody knew where it was coming from. The idea
that a random, empty folder usually associated with IIS could be part of
a vulnerability mitigation didn’t cross anybody’s mind at the time,
especially since random folders appearing at a Windows PC’s root aren’t
exactly uncommon or out of the ordinary. The consensus seems to be that
creating this folder is a pretty clever form of mitigation, despite
feeling so hacky. I’m assuming Microsoft’s engineers are capable, and
that making the folder in question impossible to delete or somehow
hidden is simply not an option and would break the vulnerability
mitigation, but that doesn’t change the fact that this looks like a
really crude hack that should be solved in a more elegant way.</p>

Recall failed the moose test, and nobody will ever forget it</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-22, from: OS News</p>
<p>Ars Technica took a look at how the current version of Windows Recall
works, including the improvements Microsoft made since the initial
security nightmare of a rollout, and concludes: Recall continues to
demand an extraordinary level of trust that Microsoft hasn’t earned.
However secure and private it is—and, again, the version people will
actually get is much better than the version that caused the original
controversy—it just feels creepy to open up the app and see confidential
work materials and pictures of your kid. You’re already trusting
Microsoft with those things any time you use your PC, but there’s
something viscerally unsettling about actually seeing evidence that your
computer is tracking you, even if you’re not doing anything you’re
worried about hiding, even if you’ve excluded certain apps or sites, and
even if you “know” that part of the reason why Recall requires a
Copilot+ PC is because it’s processing everything locally rather than on
a server somewhere. ↫ Andrew Cunningham at Ars Technica Way back in
1996, Mercedes-Benz unveiled the A-Class, a small, practical car that
purported to be more premium than cheaper, similarly-sized cars from
other brands. The car had a big problem, though – it was unusually
narrow and tall, and because of it, it famously failed spectacularly at
the “moose test”, in which a car has to suddenly swerve around a “moose”
on the road. The car simply toppled over, and after initially denying
the problem, Mercedes recalled every single A-Class sold and added a
variety of mitigations like electronic stability control and suspension
changes. As far as I can recall, it fixed the issue. To this day,
however, I cannot look at an A-Class, even the modern ones which look
like normal hatchbacks and bear effectively zero resemblance to the
original, quirky A-Class from 1996, and not think of the failed moose
test and the recall. I know the modern A-Class won’t fail that test, and
I know it’s an infinitely safer car than the original one, but my brain
still makes that connection every time I see one. A lot of people my
age, whether they’re into cars or not, seem to remember this recall,
because the original A-Class was such a unique and recognisable vehicle
at the time, especially coming from Mercedes. My point is – Recall will
face this same issue. No matter how secure Microsoft makes it, no matter
how much they claim and prove it only runs locally, no matter how hard
they try and hammer on the fact data never leaves your PC, people will
always think of that initial botched rollout, and all the accurate
reporting that Recall was a nightmare. And it just so happens that the
skepticism is warranted, and hopefully keeps people from using this
corporate Trojan horse.</p>

<p>date: 2025-04-21, from: OS News</p>
<p>We’d like to thank our outgoing sponsor, Nova Custom, for sponsoring
OSNews! Nova Custom, based in The Netherlands, makes laptops focused on
privacy, customisation, and freedom. Nova Custom laptops ship with
either Linux, Windows, or no operating system, and they’re uniquely
certified for Qubes OS (the V54 model will be certified soon), the
ultra-secure and private operating system. On top of that, Nova Custom
laptops come with Dasharo coreboot firmware preinstalled, which is
completely open source, instead of a proprietary BIOS. Nova Custom can
also disable the Intel Management Engine for you, and you can opt for
Dasharo coreboot+Heads for the ultimate in boot security. Nova Custom
offers visual customisations, too, including engraving a logo or text of
your choice on the metal screen lid and/or palmrest and adding your own
boot logo. They also offer privacy customisations like removing the
microphone and webcam, installing a privacy screen, and more. A small
touch I personally appreciate: Nova Custom offers a long, long list of
keyboard layouts, as well as the option to customise the super key. Nova
Custom products enjoy 3 years of warranty, as well as updates and spare
parts for at least seven years after the launch of a product, which
includes everything from motherboard replacements down to sets of
screws. Nova Custom laptops can be configured with a wide variety of
Intel processor options, as well as a choice between integrated Intel
GPUs or Nvidia laptop GPUs. Thanks once again to Nova Custom for
sponsoring OSNews – for a little longer than anticipated due to our
weird RSS/captcha issues.</p>

<h2 id="how-i-use-kate-editor">“How I use Kate Editor”</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-21, from: OS News</p>
<p>I love the Kate Text editor. I use it for pretty much all the
programming projects I do. Kate has been around for long time now, about
20 years! At least earliest blog post for it I could find was written in
2004. I wanted to go over my workflow with it, why I like it so much and
hopefully get more people to try it out. ↫ Akseli Lahtinen Programmers
and developers tend to be very set in their ways and have their
preferred workflows – which profession doesn’t, honestly – and since
there’s such a wide variety of developer and programming tools out
there, it feels like every single developer’s workflow and setup is
entirely unique. Akseli Lahtinen, KDE developer and allround awesome
person, details his setup using Kate, the venerable and feature-rich
text editor from the KDE project. As someone who can’t program, I can’t
really compare his workflow to my own, but what I found interesting
while reading his post is that there’s quite a bit of overlap between my
previous work as a translator and his work as a developer. While the
contents of each individual view inside his Kate window are obviously
different, the setup of windows and tools I had when translating looked
very similar. This shouldn’t be surprising to me – after all, both
translating and developing requires multiple work surfaces, language
plugins, formatting tools, tons of keyboard shortcuts, and a whole load
of browser tabs, PDF files, and other documents to find just the right
translation or the perfect term, as well as a ton of background to make
sure you understand the topic you’re translating about. Y’all have no
idea how much I know about the deepest complex inner-workings and
processes of some of the largest organisations in the world, just
because I needed to study them and had access to their internal
documentation and software. I also read and studied way too many complex
contracts, European law, and technical studies into medicine and
healthcare treatments, and I guess developers and programmers do the
same thing – just focusing on different subjects. What’s the best way to
do this thing in the programming language I’m using? How does this
library I want to integrate work? What are the API endpoints for this
service I want to use? It’s really not that different from translating,
and that never really dawned on me until now.</p>

confirms that higher-end NAS products will require its branded
drives</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-21, from: OS News</p>
<p>“Synology-branded drives will be needed for use in the newly
announced Plus series, with plans to update the Product Compatibility
List as additional drives can be thoroughly vetted in Synology systems,”
a Synology representative told Ars by email. “Extensive internal testing
has shown that drives that follow a rigorous validation process when
paired with Synology systems are at less risk of drive failure and
ongoing compatibility issues.” Without a Synology-branded or approved
drive in a device that requires it, NAS devices could fail to create
storage pools and lose volume-wide deduplication and lifespan analysis,
Synology’s German press release stated. Similar drive restrictions are
already in place for XS Plus and rack-mounted Synology models, though
work-arounds exist. ↫ Kevin Purdy at Ars Technica I’m honestly surprised
it’s taken Synology this long to start nickle-and-diming its users. I’m
sure the “Synology-branded” drives will carry substantial markups over
regular drives, despite the drives being otherwise identical. Charging
insane markups for expansion options is a tried-and-true way to increase
your margins, with Apple being the classic example of charging insane
prices for basic RAM or SSD upgrades. I think most of us here on OSNews
could easily build our own NAS, as it’s not a particularly complex
project. The various software options could be a bit more complicated to
navigate, but I don’t think it’s insurmountable for most of us. Normal,
average people, though, would most likely do best to just buy an
off-the-shelf NAS for their storage and local back-up needs, and it’s
those kind of people who Synology is aiming this policy at. They’ll be
easily fooled into thinking Synology-branded drives are somehow special,
and not just a generic drive with a fancy sticker. This is how the world
works, but that doesn’t make it any less unpleasant.</p>
