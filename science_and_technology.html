<h2 id="after-47-years-openvms-gets-a-package-manager">After 47 years,
OpenVMS gets a package manager</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-18, from: OS News</p>
<p>As of the 18th of February, OpenVMS, known for its stability and
high-availability, 47 years old and ported to 4 different CPU
architecture, has a package manager! This article shows you how to use
the package manager and talks about a few of its quirks. It’s an early
beta version, and you do notice that when using it. A small list of
things I noticed, coming from a Linux (apt/yum/dnf) background: There
seems to be no automatic dependency resolution and the dependencies it
does list are incomplete. No update management yet, no removal of
packages and no support for your own package repository, only the VSI
official one. Service startup or login script changes are not done
automatically. Packages with multiple installer files fail and require
manual intervention. It does correctly identify the architectures, has
search support and makes it way easier to install software. The time
saved by downloading, manually copying and starting installation is
huge, so even this early beta is a very welcome addition to OpenVMS. ↫
Remy van Elst Obviously, a way to install software packages without
having to manually download them is a huge step forward for OpenVMS. The
listed shortcomings might raise some eyebrows considering most of us are
used to package management on Linux/BSD, which is far more advanced.
Bear in mind, however, that this is a beta product, and it’s quite
obvious these missing essential features will be added over time.
Luckily it at least lists dependencies, so let’s hope actually
automating installing them is in the works and will be available soon. I
actually have an OpenVMS virtual machine set up and running, but I find
using it incredibly difficult – but only because of my own lack of
experience with and knowledge about OpenVMS, of course. Any experience
of knowledge rooted in UNIX-based and Windows operating systems is
useless here, even for the most basic of CLI tasks. If I find the time,
I’d love to spend more time with it and get more acquainted with the way
it works, including this new package manager.</p>

id="pebble-unveils-new-devices-and-strongly-suggests-you-dump-ios-for-android">Pebble
unveils new devices, and strongly suggests you dump iOS for Android</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-18, from: OS News</p>
<p>It’s barely been two months after the announcement that Pebble would
return with new watches, and they’re already here – well, sort of.
Pebble has announced two new watches for preorder, the Core 2 Duo and
the Core Time 2. The former is effectively a Pebble 2, upgraded with new
internals, while the Core Time 2 is very similar, but comes with a
colour e-ink display and a metal case. They’re up for preorder now at
$149 and $225, respectively, with the Core 2 Duo shipping in July, and
the Core Time 2 shipping in December. Alongside this unveil, Eric
Migicovsky, the creator of Pebble, also published a blog post detailing
the trouble Pebble is and will have with making smartwatches for iOS
users. Apple effectively makes it impossible for third parties to make a
proper smartwatch for iOS, since access to basic functionality you’d
come to expect from such a device are locked by Apple, reserved only for
its own Apple Watch. As such, Migicovsky makes it explicitly clear that
iOS users who want to buy one of these new Pebbles will are going to
have a very degraded experience compared to Android users. Not only will
Android users with Pebble have access to a ton more functionality, any
Pebble features that could exist for both Android and iOS users will
always come to Android first, and possibly iOS later. In fact,
Migicovksy goes as far as suggesting that if you want a Pebble, you
should buy an Android phone. I don’t want to see any tweets or blog
posts or complaints or whatever later on about this. I’m publishing this
now so you can make an informed decision about whether to buy a new
watch or not. If you’re worried about this, the easiest solution is to
buy an Android phone. ↫ Eric Migicovsky I have to hand it to Migicovksy
– I love the openness about this, and the fact he’s making this
explicitly clear to any prospective buyers. There’s no sugarcoating or
PR speak to try and please Tim Cook – he’s putting the blame squarely
where it belongs: on Apple. It’s kind of unreal to see such directness
about a new product, but as a Dutch person, it feels quite natural. We
need more of this style of communication in the technology world, as it
makes it much clearer that you’re getting – and not getting. I do hope
that Pebble’s Android support functions without the need for Google Play
Services or other proprietary Google code, since it would be great to
have a proper, open source smartwatch fully supported by de-Googled
Android.</p>

<h2 id="gimp-3.0-released">GIMP 3.0 released</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>It’s taken a Herculean seven-year effort, but GIMP 3.0 has finally
been released. There are so many new features, changes, and improvements
in this release that it’s impossible to highlight all of them. First and
foremost, GIMP 3.0 marks the shift to GTK3 – this may be surprising
considering GTK4 has been out for a while, but major applications such
as GIMP tend to stick to more tried and true toolkit versions. GTK4 also
brings with it the prickly discussion concerning a possible adoption of
libadwaita, the GNOME-specific augmentations on top of GTK4. The other
major change is full support for Wayland, but users of the legacy X11
windowing system don’t have to worry just yet, since GIMP 3.0 supports
that, too. As far as actual features go, there’s a ton here.
Non-destructive layer effects is one of the biggest improvements.
Another big change introduced in GIMP 3.0 is non-destructive (NDE)
filters. In GIMP 2.10, filters were automatically merged onto the layer,
which prevented you from making further edits without repeatedly undoing
your changes. Now by default, filters stay active once committed. This
means you can re-edit most GEGL filters in the menu on the layer
dockable without having to revert your work. You can also toggle them on
or off, selectively delete them, or even merge them all down
destructively. If you prefer the original GIMP 2.10 workflow, you can
select the “Merge Filters” option when applying a filter instead. ↫ GIMP
3.0 release notes There’s also much better color space management,
better layer management and control, the user interface has been
improved across the board, and support for a ton of file formats have
been added, from macOS icons to Amiga ILBM/IFF formats, and much more.
GIMP 3.0 also improves compatibility with Photoshop files, and it can
import more palette formats, including proprietary ones like Adobe Color
Book (ACB) and Adobe Swatch Exchange (ASE). This is just a small
selection, as GIMP 3.0 truly is a massive update. It’s available for
Linux, Windows, and macOS, and if you wait for a few days it’ll probably
show up in your distribution’s package repositories.</p>

<h2 id="more-pro-for-the-dec-professional-380-featuring-provenix">More
pro for the DEC Professional 380 (featuring PRO/VENIX)</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>Settle down children, it’s time for another great article by Cameron
Kaiser. This time, they’re going to tell us about the DEC Professional
380 running PRO/VENIX. The Pro 380 upgraded to the beefier J-11 (“Jaws”)
CPU from the PDP-11/73, running two to three times faster than the 325
and 350. It had faster RAM and came with more of it, and boasted quicker
graphics with double the vertical resolution built right into the logic
board. The 380 still has its faults, notably being two-thirds the speed
of the 11/73 and having no cache, plus all of the 325/350’s
incompatibilities. Taken on its merits, though, it’s a tank of a
machine, a reasonably powerful workstation, and the most practical
PDP-adjacent thing you can actually slap on a (large) desk. This
particular unit is one of the few artifacts I have left from a massive
DEC haul almost twelve years ago. It runs PRO/VENIX, the only official
DEC Unix option for the Pros, but in its less common final release
(we’ll talk about versions of Venix). I don’t trust the clanky ST-506
hard drive anymore, so today we’ll convert it to solid state and double
its base RAM to make it even more professional, and then play around in
VENIX some for a taste of old-school classic Unix — after, of course,
some history. ↫ Cameron Kaiser Detailed, interesting, fascinating, and
full of photos as always.</p>

id="apples-long-lost-hidden-recovery-partition-from-1994-has-been-found">Apple’s
long-lost hidden recovery partition from 1994 has been found</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>In 1994, a single Macintosh Performa model, the 550, came from the
factory with a dedicated, hidden recovery partition that contained a
System 7 system folder and a small application that would be set as
bootable if the main operating system failed to boot. This application
would then run, allowing you to recover your Mac using the system folder
inside the recovery partition. This feature was apparently so obscure,
few people knew it existed, and nobody had access to the original
contents of the recovery partition anymore. It took Doug Brown a lot of
searching to find a copy of this recovery partition. The issue is that
nobody really knows how this partition is populated with the recovery
data, so the only way to explore its contents was to somehow find a
Performa 550 hard drive with a specific version of Mac OS that had never
been reformatted after leaving the factory. The thing is, this whole
functionality was super obscure. It’s understandable that people weren’t
familiar with it. Apple publicly stated it was only included with this
one specific Performa model. Their own documentation also said that it
would be lost if you reformatted the hard drive. It was hiding in the
background, so nobody really knew it was there, let alone thought about
saving it. Also, I can say that the first thing a lot of people do when
they obtain a classic computer is erase it in order to restore it to the
factory state. Little did anyone know, if they reformatted the hard
drive on a Performa 550, they could have been wiping out rare data that
hadn’t been preserved! ↫ Doug Brown Brown found a copy, and managed to
get the whole original functionality working again. It’s a fairly basic
way of doing this, but we shouldn’t forget we’re talking 1994 here, and
I don’t think any other operating system at the time had the ability to
recover from an unbootable state like this. Like Brown, I wonder why it
was abandoned so quickly. Perhaps Apple was unwilling to sacrifice the
hard drive space? Groundbreaking or not, it’s still great to have this
recovered and preserved for the ages.</p>

accidentally cares about its users, releases update that unintentionally
deletes Copilot from Windows</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>It’s rare in this day and age that proprietary operating system
vendors like Microsoft and Apple release updates you’re more than happy
to install, but considering even a broken clock is right twice a day,
we’ve got one for you today. Microsoft released KB5053598 (OS Build
26100.3476) which “addresses security issues for your Windows operating
system”. One of the “security issues” this update addresses, is
Microsoft’s “AI” text generator, Copilot. To address this glaring
security issue, this update removes Copilot from your Windows
installation altogether. Sadly, it’s only by mistake, and not by design.
We’re aware of an issue with the Microsoft Copilot app affecting some
devices. The app is unintentionally uninstalled and unpinned from the
taskbar. Microsoft is working on a resolution to address this issue. In
the meantime, affected users can reinstall the app from the Microsoft
Store and manually pin it to the taskbar. ↫ Microsoft Support Well, at
least until Microsoft “fixes” this “issue” with KB5053598, consider this
update a simple way to get rid of Copilot. Microsoft accidentally cared
about its users for once, so cherish this moment – it won’t happen
again.</p>
