id="google-drastically-improves-quality-of-the-android-emulator">Google
drastically improves quality of the Android Emulator</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-14, from: OS News</p>
<p>One of the things I’ve consistently heard from just about anyone
involved in Android development are laments about the sorry state of the
Android Emulator included in Google’s Android Studio. It seems that
particularly its performance is not great, with people often resorting
to third-party options or real devices. Well, it seems the Android
development team at Google has taken this to heart, and has spent six
months focusing almost solely on fixing up the Android Emulator. We know
how critical the stability, reliability, and performance of the Android
Emulator is to your everyday work as an Android developer. After
listening to valuable feedback about stability, reliability, and
performance, the Android Studio team took a step back from large feature
work on the Android Emulator for six months and started an initiative
called Project Quartz. This initiative was made up of several
workstreams aimed at reducing crashes, speeding up startup time, closing
out bugs, and setting up better ways to detect and prevent issues in the
future. ↫ Neville Sicard-Gregory at the Android Developers Blog Steps
taken include moving to a newer version of Qt for the user interface of
the emulator, improving the graphics rendering system used in the
Android Emulator, and adding a whole bunch of tests to their existing
test suite. The end result is that the number of crashes in the Android
Emulator dropped by 30%, which, if bourne out out in the real world,
will have a material impact for Android developers. During the Project
Quartz effort, Google also cut the number of open issues by 44%, but
they do note only 17% of those were fixed during Project Quartz, with
the remainder being obsoleted or previously fixed issues. If you
download or update to the latest version of Android Studio, you’ll get
the new and improved Android Emulator as well.</p>

<h2 id="net-9-released">.NET 9 released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-13, from: OS News</p>
<p>Today, we are excited to announce the launch of .NET 9, the most
productive, modern, secure, intelligent, and performant release of .NET
yet. It’s the result of another year of effort on the part of thousands
of developers from around the world. This new release includes thousands
of performance, security, and functional improvements. You will find
sweeping enhancements across the entire .NET stack from the programming
languages, developer tools, and workloads enabling you to build with a
unified platform and easily infuse your apps with AI. ↫ .NET Team at the
.Net Blog All I know is that these are very important words, and a very
important release, for thousands and thousands of unknown developers
slaving away in obscurity, creating, maintaining, and fixing endless
amounts of corporate software very few of us ever actually get to see
very often. They toil away for meager pay in the 21st century version of
the coal mines of the 19th century, without any recognition,
appreciation, or applause. They work long hours, make their way through
the urban planning hell that is modern America, and come home to make
some gruel and drink water from lead pipes, waiting for the sweet relief
of what little sleep they manage to get, only to do it all over again
the next day. …I may have a bit of a skewed perception of reality for
most IT people. In all seriousness, .NET is a hugely popular set of
tools and frameworks, and while it’s probably not the most sexy topic in
the tech world, any new release matters to a ton of people. .NET 9.0.
This new version’s main focus seems to be performance, with over 1000
performance-related changes tot he various components that make up .NET.
In a blog post about these performance improvements, Stephen Toub
explains in great detail what some of the improvements are, and where
the benefits lie. Of course, there’s an insane amount of talk about “AI”
features in .NET 9, and apparently .NET MAUI is seeing a surge in
popularity on Android, if you believe Microsoft (“30$” increase in
“developer usage” means little when you don’t provide a baseline). .NET
MAUI is Microsoft’s cross-platform framework for building applications
for Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows. Among other things, .NET MAUI 9
provides more access to platform-native features, as well as benefiting
from some of the performance improvements. There’s also a paragraph
about .NET 9 development on Windows, just in case you thought the .NET
team forgot Windows existed. With .NET 9, your Windows apps will have
access to the latest OS features and capabilities while ensuring they
are more performant and accessible than ever before. Whether you are
starting a new modern app with WinUI 3 and the Windows App SDK or
modernizing your existing WPF and WinForms applications, your Windows
apps run best on .NET 9. We have been collaborating closely with the
Windows developer community to bring features that you have been
requesting. This includes Native AOT support for WinUI 3 for smaller and
more performant apps, modern theming enhancements with Fluent UI for
WPF, and WinForms gets a boost with a new Dark Mode, modern icon APIs,
and improved asynchronous API access with Control.InvokeAsync. ↫ .NET
Team at the .Net Blog There’s way more on top of all of this, from
changes to the languages .NET uses to new releases of the various
developer tools, like Visual Studio.</p>

Steam Client stability on Linux: setenv and multithreaded
environments</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-12, from: OS News</p>
<p>Speaking of Steam, the Linux version of Valve’s gaming platform has
just received a pretty substantial set of fixes for crashes, and
Timothee “TTimo” Besset, who works for Valve on Linux support, has
published a blog post with more details about what kind of crashes
they’ve been fixing. The Steam client update on November 5th mentions
“Fixed some miscellaneous common crashes.” in the Linux notes, which I
wanted to give a bit of background on. There’s more than one fix that
made it in under the somewhat generic header, but the one change that
made the most significant impact to Steam client stability on Linux has
been a revamping of how we are approaching
the setenv and getenv functions. One of my colleagues rightly
dubbed setenv “the worst Linux API”. It’s such a simple, common API,
available on all platforms that it was a little difficult to convince
ourselves just how bad it is. I highly encourage anyone who writes
software that will run on Linux at some point to read through
“RachelByTheBay”‘s very engaging post on the subject. ↫ Timothee “TTimo”
Besset This indeed seems to be a specific Linux problem, and due to the
variability in Linux systems – different distributions, extensive user
customisation, and so on – debugging information was more difficult to
parse than on Windows and macOS. After a lot of work grouping the debug
information to try and make sense of it all, it turned out that the two
functions in question were causing issues in threads other than those
that used them. They had to resort to several solutions, from reducing
the reliance on setenv and refactoring it with exevpe, to reducing the
reliance on getenv through caching, to introducing “an ‘environment
manager’ that pre-allocates large enough value buffers at startup for
fixed environment variable names, before any threading has started”. It
was especially this last one that had a major impact on reducing the
number of crashes with Steam on Linux. Besset does note that these
functions are still used far too often, but that at this point it’s out
of their control because that usage comes from the libraries of the
operating system, like x11, xcb, dbus, and so on. Besset also mentions
that it would be much better if this issue can be addressed in glibc,
and in the comments, a user by the name of Adhemerval reports that this
is indeed something the glibc team is working on.</p>

<h2 id="valve-ends-steams-support-for-windows-7-and-8">Valve ends
Steam’s support for Windows 7 and 8</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-12, from: OS News</p>
<p>Steam has finally stopped working on several older Windows operating
systems, following a warning from Valve that it planned to drop support
earlier this year. With little fanfare, Windows 7 and Windows 8 gaming
on Steam is no longer possible following the most recent Steam client
update on November 5. ↫ Ben Stockton at PCGamesN It’s honestly wild that
Valve supported Windows 7 and 8 for this long for Steam in the first
place. They’ve been out of support for a long time, and at this point in
time, less than 0.3% of Steam users were using Windows 7 or 8. Investing
any resources in continuing to support them would be financially
irresponsible, while also aiding a tiny bit in allowing people to use
such unsupported, insecure systems to this day. I’m sure at least one of
you is still rocking Windows 7 or 8 as your daily driver operating
system, so I’m sorry if you don’t want to hear this, but it’s really,
really time to move on. Buying a Windows 10 or 11 license on eBay or
whatever costs a few euros at most – if you’re not eligible for one the
free upgrade programs Microsoft ran – and especially Windows 10 should
run just fine on pretty much anything Windows 7 or 8 runs on. Do note
that with Windows 10, though, you’ll be back in the same boat next
year.</p>
