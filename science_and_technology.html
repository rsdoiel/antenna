id="why-did-windows-7-for-a-few-months-log-on-slower-if-you-have-a-solid-color-background">Why
did Windows 7, for a few months, log on slower if you have a solid color
background?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-30, from: OS News</p>
<p>Time for another story from Raymond Chen, about why, in Windows 7,
logging in took 30 seconds if you had set a solid colour as your
background. Windows 7’s logon system needs to wait for a number of tasks
to be completed, like creating the taskbar, populating the desktop with
icons, and setting the background. If all of those tasks are completed
or 30 seconds have passed, the welcome screen goes away. As you can
guess by the initial report mentioning having to wait for 30 seconds,
one of the tasks that need to be completed isn’t reporting in, so the
welcome screen is displayed for the full 30 seconds. In the case of this
bug, that task is obviously setting the background. The code to report
that the wallpaper is ready was inside the wallpaper bitmap code, which
means that if you don’t have a wallpaper bitmap, the report is never
made, and the logon system waits in vain for a report that will never
arrive. ↫ Raymond Chen It turns out that people who enabled the setting
the hide desktop icons were experiencing the same delay, and that, too,
was caused by the lack of a report from, in this case, the desktop
icons. Interestingly, it seems especially settings changed through group
policies can cause issues like this. Group policies are susceptible to
this problem because they tend to be bolted on after the main code is
written. When you have to add a group policy, you find the code that
does the thing, and you put a giant “if policy allows” around it. Oops,
the scope of the “if” block extended past the report call, so if the
policy is enabled, the icons are never reported as ready, and the logon
system stays on the Welcome screen for the full 30 seconds. ↫ Raymond
Chen These issues were fixed very quickly after the release of Windows
7, and they disappear from the radar within a few months after the
release of everyone’s favourite Windows version.</p>

<h2 id="google-is-working-on-a-big-ui-overhaul-for-android">Google is
working on a big UI overhaul for Android</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-30, from: OS News</p>
<p>When Google released the fourth beta of Android 16 this month, many
users were disappointed by the lack of major UI changes. As Beta 4 is
the final beta, it’s likely the stable Android 16 release won’t look
much different than last year’s release. However, that might not hold
true for subsequent updates. Google recently confirmed it will unveil a
new version of its Material Design theme at its upcoming developer
conference, and we’ve already caught glimpses of these design changes in
Android—including a notable increase in background blur effects. Ahead
of I/O next month, here’s an early look at Google’s upcoming Android
redesign. ↫ Mishaal Rahman at Android Authority With Android, it’s hard
to really care about changes like these because it will take forever and
a day for the Android ecosystem to catch up, and in general in mobile
computing, most people use applications that have zero respect for
platform integration anyway, preferring their own shit branding and UI
“design” over that of the platform they’re running on. In other words,
most people will never really encounter many of these changes, unless
they’re Pixel users. That being said, these changes seem to basically
replace a lot of “window” backgrounds with a blur, which makes
everything feel more airy and brighter – so much so that in screenshots
purporting to show dark mode, it looks like light mode. This doesn’t
really seem like the “big UI overhaul” the linked article claims it to
be, but there might be more changes on the way we haven’t seen yet.
Instead of UI changes, I’m much more concerned about how much worse
Google will be making Android by shoving Clippy into every corner of the
operating system.</p>

<h2 id="path-isnt-real-on-linux">PATH isn’t real on Linux</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-30, from: OS News</p>
<p>I have no idea how much relevance this short but informative rundown
of how PATH works in Linux has in the real world, but I found it
incredibly interesting and enlightening. The basic gist – and I might be
wrong, there’s code involved and I’m not very smart – is that Linux
itself needs absolute paths to binaries, while shells and programming
languages do not. In other words, the Linux kernel does not know about
PATH, and any lookup you’re doing comes from either the shell or the
programming language you’re using. In practice this doesn’t matter, but
it’s still interesting to know.</p>

<p>date: 2025-04-30, from: OS News</p>
<p>The majority of the traffic on the web is from bots. For the most
part, these bots are used to discover new content. These are RSS Feed
readers, search engines crawling your content, or nowadays AI bots
crawling content to power LLMs. But then there are the malicious bots.
These are from spammers, content scrapers or hackers. At my old
employer, a bot discovered a wordpress vulnerability and inserted a
malicious script into our server. It then turned the machine into a
botnet used for DDOS. One of my first websites was yanked off of Google
search entirely due to bots generating spam. At some point, I had to
find a way to protect myself from these bots. That’s when I started
using zip bombs. ↫ Ibrahim Diallo I mean, when malicious bots harm your
website, isn’t combating them with something like zip bombs simply just
self-defense?</p>

id="garmin-pay-yes-you-can-do-nfc-tap-to-pay-in-stores-without-big-tech">Garmin
Pay: yes, you can do NFC tap-to-pay in stores without big tech</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>Late last year, I went on a long journey to rid myself of as much of
my remaining ties to the big technology giants as I could. This journey
is still ongoing, with only a few thin ties remaining, but there’s one
big one I can scratch off the list: mobile in-store payments with NFC
tap-to-pay. I used Google Pay and a WearOS smartwatch for this, but
neither of those work on de-Googled Android – I opted for GrapheneOS –
and it seemed like I was just going to have to accept the loss of this
functionality. That is, until I stumbled upon a few forum posts here and
there suggesting a solution: Garmin, maker of fitness trackers and
smartwatches with a strong focus on sports, health, and the outdoor
lifestyle, has its own mobile NFC tap-to-pay service that supposedly
worked just fine on any Android device, de-Googled or not. In fact,
people claimed you could even remove the companion Garmin application
from your phone entirely after setting up the payment functionality, and
it would still keep working. This seemed like something I should look
into, because the lack of NFC tap-to-pay is a recurring concern for many
people intending to switch to de-Googled Android. So, late last year,
many of you chipped in, allowing me to buy a Garmin smartwatch to try
this functionality out, for which I’m incredibly grateful, of course.
Here’s how all of this works, and if it’s a good alternative for Google
Pay. The Garmin Instinct 2S Solar First, let’s dive into which watch I
chose to buy. Garmin has a wide variety of fitness trackers and
smartwatches in its line-up, from basic trackers, to Apple
Watch/WearOS-like devices, to outdoor-focused rugged devices. I opted
for one of the outdoor-focused rugged devices, because not only would it
give me the Garmin Pay functionality, but also a few other advantages
and unique features I figured OSNews readers would be interested in: a
simple black-and-white transflective memory-in-pixel display, a battery
life measured in weeks (!), a solar panel built into the display glass,
and a case constructed out of lightweight but durable plastics instead
of heavy, scratch-prone metal. The specific model I opted for was the
Instinct 2S Solar in Mist Grey. I wasn’t intending for this to become a
review of the watch as a whole, but I figured I might as well share some
notes about my experiences with this particular watch model. It’s
important to note though that Garmin offers a wide variety of
smartwatches, from models that look and feel mostly like an Apple Watch
or wearOS device, to mechanical models with ‘invisible’ OLED displays on
the dial, to ruggedised, button-only watches for hardcore outdoor
people. If you’re interested in a Garmin device, there’s most likely a
type that fits your wishes. The Instinct 2S is definitely not the most
beautiful or attractive watch I’ve ever had on my wrist. It has that
“rugged” look some people are really into, but for me, I definitely had
to get used to it. I do really like the colour combination I opted for,
though, as it complements the black/white transflective memory-in-pixel
display really well. I’ve grown to… Appreciate the look over time. The
case and bezel of the watch are made out of what Garmin calls
“fiber-reinforced polymer”, which is probably just a form of
fiber-reinforced plastic. Regardless of the buzzwords, it feels nice and
sturdy, with a great texture, and not at all plasticy or cheap. Using a
material like this over the metals the Apple Watch and most WearOS
devices are made of has several advantages; first, it makes the device
much lighter and thus more pleasant to wear, and it’s a lot sturdier and
resilient than metals. I’ve banged this watch into door sills and
countertops a few times now, and there’s not a scratch, dent, or
discoloration on it – a far cry from the various metal Apple Watches and
WearOS devices I own, which accumulated dings and scratches within weeks
of buying them. The case material is one of the many ways in which this
watch chooses function over form. Sure, metals might feel premium, but a
high-quality plastic is cheaper to make, lasts longer, is more
resilient, and also happens to be lighter – it’s simply the objectively
better choice for something you wear on wrist every day, exposed to the
elements. I understand why people want their smartwatch to be made out
of metal, but much like how the orange-red plastic of the Nexus 5 is
still the best smartphone material I’ve ever experienced (the white and
black models uses inferior plastics), this Garmin tops all of the metal
watches I own. The strap is made of silicone, and has an absurd amount
of tightly-spaced adjustment holes, which makes it very easy to adjust
to changing circumstances, like a bit of extra slack for when you’re
working out. It also has a nice touch in that the second loop has a
little peg that slots into an adjustment hole, keeping it in place.
Ingenious. Other than that, it’s just a silicone band with the clasp
made out of the same sturdy, pleasant “fiber-reinforced polymer” as the
case. The lens over the display is made out of something Garmin calls
“Power Glass™”, and I have no idea what that means. It just feels like a
watch lens to me – solid, glassy, and… I don’t know, round? The unique
aspect of the display glass is, of course, the built-in solar panel.
It’s hard for me to tell what kind of impact – if any – the solar panel
has on the battery life of the device. What quite obviously does not
help is that I live in the Arctic where sun hours come at a bit of a
premium, so it’s been impossible for me to stand outside and hold out my
arm for a while to see if it had an effect on the charge level. There’s
a software</p>

release: OpenBSD 7.7 to be exact. Browsing through the long, detailed
list of changes, a few important bits jump out. First, OpenBSD 7.7 adds
support for Ryzen AI 300 (Strix Point, Strix Halo, Krackan Point),
Radeon RX 9070 (Navi 48), and Intel’s Arrow Lake, adding support for the
latest x86 processors to OpenBSD. There seems to be quite a few entries
in the list related to power management, from work on hibernation and
suspend, to more fine-grained control over performance profiles when on
battery or plugged in. There’s also the usual long list of driver
improvements, new drivers, and tons and tons of other fixes and changes.
OpenBSD 7.7 also ships with the latest GNOME and KDE releases, and
contains fixes and improvements for a whole slew of obscure and outdated
architectures.</p>

Wii homebrew library contains code stolen from Nintendo, RTEMS</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-27, from: OS News</p>
<p>The Wii homebrew community has been dealt a pretty serious blow, as
developers of The Homebrew Channel for the Wii have discovered that not
only does an important library most Wii homebrew software rely on use
code stolen straight from Nintendo, that same library also uses code
taken from an open source real-time operating system without giving
proper attribution. Most Wii homebrew software is built atop a library
called libogc. This library apparently contains code stolen from
Nintendo’s SDK as well as from games using this SDK, decompiled and
cleaned. This has been known for a while, but it was believed that
large, important parts of libogc were at least original, but that, too,
turns out to be untrue. Recently it has been discovered that libogc’s
threading/OS implementation has been stolen from RTEMS, an open source
real-time operating system. The developers of libogc have indicated that
they do not care, intend to do nothing about it, and deleted any issues
reporting the stolen code. What’s wild about the code stolen from RTEMS
is that it’s an open source operating system with a nice, permissive
license; there was no need to steal the code at all, and all it would
take to address it is proper attribution. As such, the fail0verflow
group, which develops The Homebrew Channel for the Wii, has ceased all
development on The Homebrew Channel, and archived the code repository.
The Wii homebrew community was all built on top of a pile of lies and
copyright infringement, and it’s all thanks to shagkur (who did the
stealing) and the rest of the team (who enabled it and did nothing when
it was discovered). Together, the developers deceived everyone into
believing their work was original. Please demand that the leaders and
major contributors to console or other proprietary device SDKs and
toolkits that you use and work with do things legally, and do not
tolerate this kind of behavior. ↫ The Homebrew Channel GitHub page
Considering Nintendo is on a crusade to shutdown emulators, stuff like
this is really not helping anyone trying to argue that consoles should
be open devices, that emulators play an important role in preservation,
and that people have a right to play the games they own on a device
other than the console it’s intended for. I’m sure this isn’t the last
we’ll hear about this development.</p>

a 32bit hobby operating system with graphics, multitasking, and
more</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-27, from: OS News</p>
<p>RetrOS-32 is a 32bit operating system written from scratch, with
graphics, multitasking and networking capabilities. The kernel is
written in C and assembly, while the userspace applications are written
in C++, using Make for compilation, all licensed under the MIT license.
It runs on Qemu, of course, but a variety of real hardware is also
supported, which is pretty cool and relatively unique for a small hobby
project like this. The UI is delightfully retro – as the name obviously
implies – and it comes with a set of basic applications, as well as
games like Wolfenstein 3D.</p>
