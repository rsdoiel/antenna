<h2 id="windows-hotpatch-comes-to-client-version-of-windows">Windows
Hotpatch comes to client version of Windows</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-04, from: OS News</p>
<p>Good news for Windows users, and for once there’s not a hint of
sarcasm here: Microsoft has started rolling out Windows Hotpatch to the
client versions of Windows. This feature, which comes from the server
versions of Windows, allows the operating system to install patches to
in-memory processes, removing the need for a number of restarts.
Obviously, this is hugely beneficial for users, as they won’t have to
deal with constant reboots whenever a new bunch of Windows updates are
pushed. There are some limitations and other things you should know.
First, the way the system works is that every quarter, installations
with Hotpatch enabled will receive a quarterly baseline update that
requires a reboot, followed by two months of hotpatches which do not
require a reboot. Hotpatches can only be security updates; new features
and enhancements are rolled up into the quarterly baseline updates. In
other words, while this will not completely eliminate reboots, it will
cut the number of reboots per year down from twelve to just four, which
is substantial, and very welcome in especially corporate environments.
The biggest limitation, however, is that Windows Hotpatch will only make
it to one client version of Windows, Enterprise version 24H2, so users
of the Home or Professional version are out of luck for now. On top of
that, you’re going to need a Microsoft subscription, use Microsoft
Intune, and an Intel/AMD-based system (Hotpatch will come to ARM later).
I hope it’ll make its way to Windows 11 Home and Professional, too,
because I’m fairly sure quite a few of you using Windows would love to
set this up on your own machines.</p>

<h2 id="how-big-is-vms">How big is VMS?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-04, from: OS News</p>
<p>This question was asked during my Boot Camp presentation last fall in
Boston, and over the past 35 years dozens of times people have asked,
how big is VMS? That translates into “how many lines of code are in
VMS”? I thought it was time to at least make a stab at pursuing some
insight into the answer. I wrote some command procedures to count the
number of source lines in .B32, .B64, .C, .MAR, .M64, and .S files. Not
counted are blank lines and lines beginning with the standard comment
characters and miscellaneous directives for the particular language. ↫
Clair Grant As always with the ‘lines of code’ metric, there’s some real
arbitrariness going on, and in this case that means things like
excluding networking, which to me seems like a core part of an operating
system, but alas, choices need to be made. The final tally for lines of
code, as per the definition used in the article, in the most recent
version of OpenVMS, version 9.2-3, is almost 1.9 million. Do with that
information as you please. What’s really fascinating, though, are the
deltas between the versions investigated in this article: V6.2 (May
1995, port to Alpha), V7.2 (February 1999, kernel threads, 64-bit APIs,
Galaxy, and more), V8.2 (February 2005, port to Itanium), V9.2-3
(december 2024, port to x86). Going from one version to the next,
roughly 400000 lines of code were added each time – the article doesn’t
theorise about the consistency of this number, and I suspect it’s mostly
just a fun coincidence, but it does jump out.</p>

id="microsofts-50th-anniversary-celebrations-tainted-by-the-companys-role-in-the-genocide-in-gaza">Microsoft’s
50th anniversary celebrations tainted by the company’s role in the
genocide in Gaza</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-04, from: OS News</p>
<p>Microsoft is celebrating its 50th anniversary, and in honour of this
milestone, Bill Gates has published a blog post about the first code the
company ever wrote. In 1975, Paul Allen and I created Microsoft because
we believed in our vision of a computer on every desk and in every home.
Five decades later, Microsoft continues to innovate new ways to make
life easier and work more productive. Making it 50 years is a huge
accomplishment, and we couldn’t have done it without incredible leaders
like Steve Ballmer and Satya Nadella—along with the many people who have
worked at Microsoft over the years. ↫ Bill Gates There’s obviously no
denying the impact Microsoft has had on the computer industry and the
world as a whole, and a lot of that impact is not exactly what you would
call positive. I find the fact that the blog post by Gates is nothing
but JavaScript that slows down some browsers and devices, breaks page
up/page down navigation for some people, does not allow for text
selection, and whose source code is just a bunch of scripts without any
of the actual text is a biting metaphor for the role Microsoft has
played in the industry. Making today’s celebrations even more biting is
the fact that Microsoft’s role in the ongoing genocide in Gaza is
causing a lot of unrest within the company. Twice now today,
presentations and talks by Microsoft’s current and former CEOs have been
interrupted by Microsoft employees protesting Microsoft’s contributions
to the genocide in Gaza, and before the day’s over there will probably
be more incidents like these. One of the Microsoft employees who
protested, Ibtihal Aboussad, also sent an email to thousands of
Microsoft employees, detailing why Microsoft employees are protesting
today. My name is Ibtihal, and for the past 3.5 years, I’ve been a
software engineer on Microsoft’s AI Platform org. I spoke up today
because after learning that my org was powering the genocide of my
people in Palestine, I saw no other moral choice. This is especially
true when I’ve witnessed how Microsoft has tried to quell and suppress
any dissent from my coworkers who tried to raise this issue. For the
past year and a half, our Arab, Palestinian, and Muslim community at
Microsoft has been silenced, intimidated, harassed, and doxxed, with
impunity from Microsoft. Attempts at speaking up at best fell on deaf
ears, and at worst, led to the firing of two employees for simply
holding a vigil. There was simply no other way to make our voices heard.
↫ Ibtihal Aboussad It goes without saying that Ibtihal Aboussad can
probably go and clean out her desk after this, but giving up what must
be a high-paying job – and possibly risking worse under the current
Trump regime – for standing up and protesting an ongoing genocide is
nothing but praise-worthy and noble. It obviously won’t stop the
genocide or make Microsoft even blink, but it’s better than doing
nothing, and it does painfully highlight how many other Microsoft
employees remain silent while the company they work for does an IBM. I
don’t really care about Microsoft’s 50th anniversary. Look at any of the
company’s current products – Office, Windows, the “AI” stuff – and
there’s clearly nothing left. They’re empty shells of what they used to
be, hollowed out, their contents replaced with upsells, dark patterns,
cruft, and “AI” nonsense nobody wants. But hey, at least Microsoft is
creating synergies to make eradicating Gazans easier. Here’s your party
popper.</p>

<h2 id="an-alphastations-srom">An AlphaStation’s SROM</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-04, from: OS News</p>
<p>The AlphaStation 500 is a workstation from Digital, circa 1996. Mine
is a 500 MHz model and has an Alpha 21164A processor (aka EV56). And the
way it boots is weird. On your common-or-garden PC, there has always
been some kind of ROM chip. It holds a piece of firmware known as the
BIOS. This ROM chip is available at a well-known location in the
processor’s address space (remembering that any PC processor boots up in
16-bit, 8088 compatible mode, with a 1 MiB address space, just like an
IBM PC 5150) and the processor just starts executing code in it after
reset. The Alpha (or at least this AlphaStation 500 – although I think
they mostly worked like this) is different. ↫ Jonathan ‘theJPster’
Pallant A great read, but a little bit over my head considering I’m
anything but a programmer or developer. Still, even I managed to get the
basic gist and learn quite a bit from this article, and especially the
part about how the AlphaStation uses a little jumper to tell the SROM
exactly which stream of boot code to send to the processor is
fascinating. I’m not sure just how unusual the Alpha’s way of booting
is, but I’d at least never heard of it.</p>

QuickInstall simplifies installing Windows 98</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>If you’re elbow-deep in ’90s retrocomputing and maintain a fleet of
your own personal seemingly identical but definitely completely
different Windows 98 machines, Windows 9x QuickInstall is tailor-made
just for you. It takes the root file system of an already installed
Windows 98 system and packages it, whilst allowing drivers and tools to
be slipstreamed at will. For the installer, it uses Linux as a base,
paired with some tools to allow hard disk partitioning and formatting,
as well as a custom installer with a custom data packing method that is
optimized for streaming directly from CD to the hard disk without any
seeking. ↫ Windows 9x QuickInstall gitHub page What you end up with is
an easily customisable packaged Windows 98 installation that can be
installed onto computers (or in virtual machines, I guess) at blazing
speeds. It’s a relatively simple concept, but its implementation is
genius and definitely not simple at all. This is a great tool for the
retrocomputing community.</p>

Windows on arm: here is Windows running on the Pixel Watch 3</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-02, from: OS News</p>
<p>Right off the bat, there is not that much use for a Pixel Watch with
Windows on it. The project, as the maker says, is for “shits and
giggles” and more like an April Fool’s joke. However, it shows how
capable modern smartwatches are, with the Pixel Watch 3 being powered by
a processor with four ARM Cortex A53 cores, 2GB of DDR4X memory, and
32GB of storage. Getting Windows to run on Gustave’s arm, as you can
imagine, took some time and effort of inspecting a rooted boot image,
modifying the stock UEFI to run custom UEFI, editing the ACPI table, and
patching plenty of other files. The result of all that is a Pixel Watch
3 with Windows PE. ↫ Taras Buria at Neowin More of this sort of
nonsense, please. This is such a great idea, especially because it’s so
utterly useless and pointless. However pointless it may be, though, it
does show that Windows on ARM is remarkably flexible, as it’s been
ported to a variety of ARM devices it should never be supposed to run
on. With Microsoft’s renewed entry into the ARM world with Windows on
ARM and Qualcomm, I would’ve hoped for more standardisation in the ARM
space to bring it closer to the widely compatible world of x86. That,
sadly, has not yet happened, and I doubt it ever will – it seems like
ARM is already too big of a fragmented mess to be consolidated for easy
portability for operating systems. Instead, individual crazy awesome
people have to manually port Windows to other ARM variants, and that,
while cool projects, is kind of sad.</p>

history, legacy, and a valuable resource for old machines</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-02, from: OS News</p>
<p>FreeDOS is a free and open‐source operating system designed to be
compatible with MS‑DOS. Developed to keep the DOS experience alive even
after Microsoft ended support for MS‑DOS, FreeDOS has grown into a
complete environment that not only preserves classic DOS functionality
but also introduces modern enhancements. Its simplicity and low resource
requirements have made it a cherished resource for retro computing
enthusiasts and a practical tool for embedded systems and legacy
hardware. ↫ André Machado A short but useful overview of what FreeDOS
is. One of my favourite stories about FreeDOS will always be not just
that HP offered it as an option on some of its laptops – supposedly
because it couldn’t sell laptops without an operating system
preinstalled – but also just how convoluted this preinstalled copy of
FreeDOS was set up. They shipped several FreeDOS virtual machines on top
of a minimal installation of Debian, in a complex web of operating
systems and VMs.</p>

either Linux, Windows, or no operating system, and they’re uniquely
certified for Qubes OS (the V54 model will be certified soon), the
ultra-secure and private operating system. On top of that, Nova Custom
laptops come with Dasharo coreboot firmware preinstalled, which is
completely open source, instead of a proprietary BIOS. Nova Custom can
also disable the Intel Management Engine for you, and you can opt for

id="the-32bit-risc-os-needs-to-be-ported-to-64bit-to-survive-seeks-help">The
32bit RISC OS needs to be ported to 64bit to survive, seeks help</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-30, from: OS News</p>
<p>RISC OS, the operating system from the United Kingdom originally
designed to run on Acorn Computer’s Archimedes computers – the first ARM
computers – is still actively developed today. Especially since the
introduction of the Raspberry Pi, new life was breathed into this ageing
operating system, and it has gained quite a bit of steady momentum ever
since, with tons of small updates, applications, and new hardware
support, including things like support for wireless networking. This
development has always been a bit piecemeal, though, and the pace has
never been exceptionally fast. Now, though, time really is ticking for
RISC OS: popular RISC OS platforms like the Raspberry Pi are moving to
64bit ARM only, and this poses a big problem for RISC OS: most of it is
written in pure 32bit ARM assembly. As you can imagine, the supply of
capable 32bit ARM boards is going to dwindle over the coming years,
which would put RISC OS right back where it was before the launch of the
Raspberry Pi: floundering, relying on old hardware. This is obviously
not ideal, and as such, RISC OS Open Limited wants to take a big leap to
address this. Since 2011, ROOL has successfully delivered dozens of
community-funded improvements through its bounty scheme. While this
model has enabled steady progress, it is not suited to the scale of work
now required to modernise RISC OS. The Moonshots initiative represents a
fundamental shift: focused, multi-year development projects undertaken
by full-time engineers. The first Moonshot aims to make the RISC OS
source code portable and compatible with 64-bit Arm platforms, a
prerequisite for future hardware support. ROOL has already scoped the
work, identified key milestones, and built cost models based on
realistic employment and project management needs. ↫ Steve Revill in a
ROOL press release They’re going to need a dedicated team of several
developers working over the course of several years to port RISC OS to
64bit ARM. That’s going to require quite a bit of money, manpower, and
expertise, and considering ROOL has only collected about £100000 worth
of donations over the past 14 years, I can see why they’re aiming to go
big for this effort. All these giant technology corporations with
trillion dollar stock valuations are currently relying on ARM
technology, so you’d think they could empty a few socks and cough up a
few million to get this effort funded properly, but alas, we all know
that’s not going to happen. I hope ROOL can make this work. RISC OS is a
ton of fun to use, and occupies a unique place in computing history. I
would be incredibly sad to see technological progress leave it behind,
when what amount to chump change for so many wealthy companies and
individuals could save it.</p>

makes it even harder to use a local account on Windows 11</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-30, from: OS News</p>
<p>Do you want to install Windows 11 without internet access or without
an online Microsoft Account? It seems Microsoft really doesn’t want you
to, as it has removed a very common and popular way of bypassing this
requirement. In the release notes for the latest builds from the Dev and
Beta channels, the company notes: We’re removing the bypassnro.cmd
script from the build to enhance security and user experience of Windows
11. This change ensures that all users exit setup with internet
connectivity and a Microsoft Account. Let me blow your minds and state
that I don’t think online accounts for an operating system are
inherently a bad idea. I would love it if I could install Fedora KDE on
a new machine, optionally log into some online “Fedora Account”, and
have my customisations and applications synchronise automatically. It
would save me some time and effort, and assuming it’s all properly
encrypted and secured, I don’t think the risk factors are particularly
high. The keyword here is, of course, optionally. Microsoft wants every
Windows 11 user to have a Microsoft Account instead of a local account,
and would rather not make it optional at all. Of course, this is still
Microsoft, a company wholly incapable of doing anything right when it
comes to operating systems, so even making this script available again
during installation is stupidly easy. It took a few nerds mere moments
to discover you could just make some registry changes during
installation, reboot, and have the script return to its rightful place.
Oh Microsoft. Never change.</p>

releases Windows 11 roadmap tool to help make sense of Windows 11’s
development</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-30, from: OS News</p>
<p>I’ve complained about the utter inscrutability of the Windows release
process for a long time, with Microsoft seemingly using channels, build
numbers, code names, date-based version numbers, and so on
interchangeably, making it incredibly hard to keep track of what is
being released when. It turns out even Microsoft itself started losing
track, because it’s now released a roadmap for Windows 11 development.
In the roadmap tool – of course it’s a tool – you can select a platform,
which isn’t x86 or ARM, but Windows PC or Copilot+ PC, a version (23H2
or 24H2 for now), a status (In preview, Gradually rolling out, or
Generally available), and a channel (Canary, Dev, Beta, or Retail),
after which the roadmap tool will list whatever features match those
criteria. Do you now see why people might want such a tool to keep track
of what the hell is going on with Windows? Anyway, as the date-based
version numbers – 23H2 and 24H2 – may already make clear, this seems
more like a roadmap about where development’s been than where
development’s going. The problem for Microsoft, of course, is that it
maintains several different Windows variants with different feature sets
and update schedules, and users, too, can of course opt to stick to
certain versions before moving on. The end result is this spaghetti,
which makes it hard to untangle when you’re getting which feature.
Anyway, if you’re elbow-deep in the Windows spaghetti, this tool may be
of use to you.</p>
