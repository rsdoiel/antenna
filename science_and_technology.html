id="that-time-ai-translation-almost-caused-a-fight-between-a-doctor-and-my-parents">That
time “AI” translation almost caused a fight between a doctor and my
parents</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-02, from: OS News</p>
<p>What if you want to find out more about the PS/2 Model 280? You head
out to Google, type it in as a query, and realise the little “AI”
summary that’s above the fold is clearly wrong. Then you run the same
query again, multiple times, and notice that each time, the “AI”
overview gives a different wrong answer, with made-up details it’s
pulling out of its metaphorical ass. Eventually, after endless tries,
Google does stumble upon the right answer: there never was a PS/2 Model
280, and every time the “AI” pretended that there was, it made up the
whole thing. Google’s “AI” is making up a different type of computer out
of thin air every time you ask it about the PS/2 Model 280, including
entirely bonkers claims that it had a 286 with memory expandable up to
128MB of RAM (the 286 can’t have more than 16). Only about 1 in 10 times
does the query yield the correct answer that there is no Model 280 at
all. An expert will immediately notice discrepancies in the hallucinated
answers, and will follow for example the List of IBM PS/2 Models article
on Wikipedia. Which will very quickly establish that there is no Model
280. The (non-expert) users who would most benefit from an AI search
summary will be the ones most likely misled by it. How much would you
value a research assistant who gives you a different answer every time
you ask, and although sometimes the answer may be correct, the incorrect
answers look, if anything, more “real” than the correct ones? ↫ Michal
Necasek at the OS/2 Museum This is only about a non-existent model of
PS/2, which doesn’t matter much in the grand scheme of things. However,
what if someone is trying to find information about how to use a
dangerous power tool? What if someone asks the Google “AI” about how to
perform a certain home improvement procedure involving electricity? What
if you try to repair your car following the instructions provided by
“AI”? What if your mother follows the instructions listed in the leaflet
that came with her new medication, which was “translated” using “AI”,
and contains dangerous errors? My father is currently undertaking a long
diagnostic process to figure out what kind of age-related condition he
has, which happens to involve a ton of tests and interviews by
specialists. Since my parents are Dutch and moved to Sweden a few years
ago, language is an issue, and as such, they rely on interpreters and my
Swedish wife’s presence to overcome that barrier. A few months ago,
though, they received the Swedish readout of an interview with a
specialist, and pasted it into Google Translate to translate it to
Dutch, since my wife and I were not available to translate it properly.
Reading through the translation, it all seemed perfectly fine; exactly
the kind of fact-based, point-by-point readout doctors and medical
specialists make to be shared with the patient, other involved
specialists, and for future reference. However, somewhere halfway
through, the translation suddenly said, completely out of nowhere: “The
patient was combative and non-cooperative” (translated into English). My
parents, who can’t read Swedish and couldn’t double-check this, were
obviously taken aback and very upset, since this weird interjection had
absolutely no basis in reality. This readout covered a basic
question-and-answer interview about symptoms, and at no point during the
conversation with the friendly and kind doctor was there any strife or
modicum of disagreement. Still, being into their ’70s and going through
a complex and stressful diagnostic process in a foreign healthcare
system, it’s not unsurprising my parents got upset. When they shared
this with the rest of our family, I immediately thought there must’ve
been some sort of translation error introduced by Google Translate,
because not only does the sentence in question not match my parents and
the doctor in question at all, it would also be incredibly
unprofessional. Even if the sentence were an accurate description of the
patient-doctor interaction, it would never be shared with the patient in
such a manner. So, trying to calm everyone down by suggesting it was
most likely a Google Translate error, I asked my parents to send me the
source text so my wife and I could pour over it to discover where Google
Translate went wrong, and if, perhaps, there was a spelling error in the
source, or maybe some Swedish turn of phrase that could easily be
misinterpreted even by a human translator. After pouring over the
documents for a while, we came to a startling conclusion that was so, so
much worse. Google Translate made up the sentence out of thin air. This
wasn’t Google Translate taking a sentence and mangling it into something
that didn’t make any sense. This wasn’t a spelling error that tripped up
the numbskull “AI”. This wasn’t a case of a weird Swedish expression
that requires a human translator to properly interpret and localise into
Dutch. None of the usual Google Translate limitations were at play here.
It just made up a very confrontational sentence out of thin air, and
dumped it in between two other sentence that were properly present in
the source text. Now, I can only guess at what happened here, but my
guess is that the preceding sentence in the source readout was very
similar to a ton of other sentences in medical texts ingested by
Google’s “AI”, and in some of the training material, that sentence was
followed by some variation of “patient was combative and
non-cooperative”. Since “AI” here is really just glorified autocomplete,
it did exactly what autocomplete does: it made shit up that wasn’t
there, thereby almost causing a major disagreement between a licensed
medical professional and a patient. Luckily for the medical professional
and the patient in question, we caught it in time, and my family had a
good laugh about it, but the next person this happens to might not be so
lucky. Someone visiting a</p>

<h2 id="gnome-os-ready-for-more-extensive-testing">GNOME OS ready for
more extensive testing</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-02, from: OS News</p>
<p>While it’s still early days and it’s not recommended for
non-technical audiences, GNOME OS is now ready for developers and early
adopters who know how to deal with occasional bugs (and importantly,
file those bugs when they occur). ↫ Tobias Bernard This is great news,
and means GNOME OS is progressing nicely. I’m a proponent of this and
KDE’s equivalent project, because it allows the people working on GNOME
and KDE to really showcase their work in optimal, controlled conditions.
While I don’t see myself switching to a Flatpak-based, immutable
distribution because they tend to not align with what I want out of an
operating system, they’ll serve as great showcases. There is a risk
associated with these projects, though, as I highlighted the last time
we talked about them. Once such “official” GNOME and KDE Linux
distributions exist, the projects run a real risk of only really caring
about how well GNOME and KDE work there, while not caring as much, or
even at all, how well they run everywhere else. I’m not sure how they
intend to prevent this from happening, but from here, I can already see
the drama erupting. I hope this is something they take into
consideration. We’ll have to wait and see if my worries are founded or
not.</p>

of course the Apple Network Server can be hacked into running Doom</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-02, from: OS News</p>
<p>Of course you can run Doom on a $10,000+ Apple server running IBM
AIX. Of course you can. Well, you can now. Now, let’s go ahead and get
the grumbling out of the way. No, the ANS is not running Linux or
NetBSD. No, this is not a backport of NCommander’s AIX Doom, because
that runs on AIX 4.3. The Apple Network Server could run no version of
AIX later than 4.1.5 and there are substantial technical differences.
(As it happens, the very fact it won’t run on an ANS was what prompted
me to embark on this port in the first place.) And no, this is not
merely an exercise in flogging a geriatric compiler into building Doom
Generic, though we’ll necessarily do that as part of the conversion.
There’s no AIX sound driver for ANS audio, so this port is mute, but at
the end we’ll have a Doom executable that runs well on the ANS console
under CDE and has no other system prerequisites. We’ll even test it on
one of IBM’s PowerPC AIX laptops as well. Because we should. ↫ Cameron

<h2 id="my-experience-with-canonicals-interview-process">“My experience
with Canonical’s interview process”</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-02, from: OS News</p>
<p>A short while ago, we talked about the hellish hiring process at a
Silicon Valley startup, and today we’ve got another one. Apparently,
it’s an open secret that the hiring process at Canonical is a complete
dumpster fire. I left Google in April 2024, and have thus been casually
looking for a new job during 2024. A good friend of mine is currently
working at Canonical, and he told me that it’s quite a nice company with
a great working environment. Unfortunately, the internet is full of
people who had a poor experience: Glassdoor shows that only 15% had a
positive interview experience, famous internet denizens like sara
rambled on the topic, reddit, hackernews, indeed and blind all say it’s
terrible, … but the idea of being decently paid to do security work on a
popular Linux distribution was really appealing to me. ↫ Julien Voisin
What follows is Byzantine and ridiculous, and all ultimately unnecessary
since it turns out Mark Shuttleworth interviews applicants at the end of
this horrid process and yays or nays people on vibes alone. You have to
read it to believe it. One interesting note that I do appreciate is that
Voisin used their rights under the GDPR to force Canonical to hand over
the feedback about his application since the GDPR considers it personal
information. Delicious.</p>
