<h2 id="oasis-a-small-statically-linked-linux-system">Oasis: a small,
statically-linked Linux system</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>You might think the world of Linux distributions is a rather boring,
settled affair, but there’s actually a ton of interesting
experimentation going on in the Linux world. From things like NixOS with
its unique packaging framework, to the various immutable distributions
out there like the Fedora Atomic editions, there’s enough uniqueness to
go around to find a lid for every pot. Oasis Linux surely falls into
this category. One of its main unique characteristics is that it’s
entirely statically linked. All software in the base system is linked
statically, including the display server (velox) and web browser
(netsurf). Compared to dynamic linking, this is a simpler mechanism
which eliminates problems with upgrading libraries, and results in
completely self-contained binaries that can easily be copied to other
systems. ↫ Oasis GitHub page That’s not all it has to offer, though. It
also offers fast and 100% reproducible builds, it’s mostly ISO C
conformant, and it has minimal bootstrap dependencies – all you need is
a “POSIX system with git, lua, curl, a sha256 utility, standard
compression utilities, and an x86_64-linux-musl cross compiler”. The ISO
C-comformance is a crucial part of one of Oasis’ goals: to be buildable
with cproc, a small, very strict C11 compiler. It has no package
manager, but any software outside of Oasis itself can be installed and
managed with pkgsrc or Nix. Another important goal of the project is to
be extremely easy to understand, and its /etc directory is honestly a
sight to behold, and as the project proudly claims, the most complex
file in there is rc.init at a mere 16 lines. The configuration files are
indeed incredibly easy to understand, which is a breath of fresh air
compared to the archaic stuff in commercial UNIX or the complex stuff in
modern Linux distributions that I normally deal with. I’m not sure is
Oasis would make for a good, usable day-to-day operating system, but I
definitely like what they’re putting down.</p>

<h2 id="redox-relibc-becomes-a-stable-abi">Redox’ relibc becomes a
stable ABI</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>The Redox project has posted its usual monthly update, and this time,
we’ve got a major milestone creeping within reach. Thanks to Anhad Singh
for his amazing work on Dynamic Linking! In this
southern-hemisphere-Redox-Summer-of-Code project, Anhad has implemented
dynamic linking as the default build method for many recipes, and all
new porting can use dynamic linking with relatively little effort. This
is a huge step forward for Redox, because relibc can now become a stable
ABI. And having a stable ABI is one of the prerequisites for Redox to
reach “Release 1.0”. ↫ Ribbon and Ron Williams A major step forward for
Redox, and one of those things not everyone might think about when they
consider the state of an operating system. This wasn’t all of the news
this month, though, as Redox also received a port of the LOVE game
engine, which powers quite a few successful indie games, like the recent
hit Balatro. Thanks to this port, you can now play Balatro on Redox,
which is pretty cool – and highlights just how far Redox has already
come. On top of these major two headlines, there’s a ton of improvements
all over the operating system, mostly at the lower levels.</p>

<h2 id="rediscovering-plan-9-from-bell-labs">Rediscovering Plan 9 from
Bell Labs</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>During a weekend of tidying up – you know, the kind of chore where
you’re knee-deep in old boxes before you realize it. Digging through the
dusty cables and old, outdated user manuals, I found something that I
had long forgotten: an old Plan 9 distribution. Judging by the faded ink
and slight warping of the disk sleeve, it had to be from around 1994 or
1995. I couldn’t help but wonder: why had I kept this? Back then, I was
curious about Plan 9. It was a forward-thinking OS that never quite
reached full potential. Holding that disk, however, it felt more like a
time capsule, a real reminder of computing’s advancements and
adventurous spirit in the 1990s. ↫ Bill Dyer at It’s FOSS As the article
notes, 9front is the way to go if you want to try Plan 9 today. Plan
9/9front appeals to a very specific type of person, but when you dive
into the excellent – and incredibly entertaining – documentation, it
really seems quite easy to grasp and get started with. There’s
definitely things you’ll need to unlearn and some compromises you’ll
need to make, but I think you’ll be able to get a lot more work done
than you might think. Also, if you start adding software to 9front, you
get to use the best GitHub alternative of all time: shithub. That alone
makes it worth it to try 9front.</p>

and hi-fi audio setup: bit-perfect, equalizer, real-time</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>A complete guide to configuring FreeBSD as an audiophile audio
server: setting up system and audio subsystem parameters, real-time
operation, bit-perfect signal processing, and the best methods for
enabling and parameterising the system graphic equalizer (equalizer) and
high-quality audio equalization with FFmpeg filters. Linux users will
also find useful information, especially in the context of configuring
and personalising the MPD player and filters. ↫ Marcin Szewczyk-Wilgan
FreeBSD is a much more capable desktop and workstation operating system
than it gets credit for, especially with the Linux world sucking all the
air out of the room, but you do often need to do a little more and dive
a little deeper into the operating system to get it to do what you want.
In the case of audio, Szewczyk-Wilgan explains that he thinks it’s even
ahead of Linux, due to being able to “precisely track the parameters of
the audio device along with the system kernel parameters and modify
them”, as well as FreeBSD having better support for real-time operation.
This guide is an incredibly detailed explanation of which options and
configurations you should use in FreeBSD to turn it into an audio
server. This clearly isn’t for everyone, and I assume most audio experts
won’t be considering FreeBSD, but what this article demonstrates is that
it’s very, very much possible to do so.</p>

id="three-years-of-ephemeral-nixos-my-experience-resetting-root-on-every-boot">Three
years of ephemeral NixOS: my experience resetting root on every
boot</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>We had a bit of a bug caused by changes we made to make quotes look
better, but we’ve fixed it now, so we’re back on track (you may need to
do a force-reload in your browser). Sorry for the disruption – and if
you want to stay up-to-date on such issues next time it (inevitably)
happens, you should follow the OSNews Fedi account (or just bookmark it
without following it, if you’re not interested in social media). Anyway,
back to the news! Fresh OS installs are bliss. But the joy fades quickly
as installing and uninstalling programs leave behind a trail of digital
debris. Even configuration management and declarative systems like NixOS
miss crucial bits, like the contents of /var/lib or stray dotfiles. This
debris isn’t just unsightly. It can be load-bearing, crucial to the
functioning of your system, but outside of your control, and not
preserved on rebuilds. Full system backups merely preserve this chaos. I
wanted a clean slate, automatically, every boot. “Erase your darlings”
inspired an idea in the NixOS community: allowlisting files and
directories that persist across reboots. Anything not on the list gets
wiped. The simplest implementation involves mounting / as a tmpfs
(i.e. in RAM), and then bind-mounting or symlinking the allowlisted
items to a disk-backed filesystem. ↫ Tuxes.uk I dabbled in NixOS over
the past week or so, and while I find it intriguing and can definitely
see a use for it, I also found it rather needlessly cumbersome and
over-engineered for something as simple as a desktop system. I felt like
I was taking a whole bunch of additional steps to do basic things,
without needing any of the benefits Nix and NixOS bring. This doesn’t
mean Nix and NixOS are bad – just that for me, personally, it doesn’t
fill any need I have. Taking the Nix concept as far as starting with a
completely fresh installation on every boot sounds absolutely insane to
me. Of course, it’s not entirely fresh on every reboot, as several
applications and important configuration elements do survive the reboot,
but it’s still quite drastic compared to what everyone else is doing.
Unsurprisingly, there are a few issues; it’s hard to know what really
needs and doesn’t need saving, there might be some unexpected issues
because software doesn’t expect to be wiped, and so on. Overall though,
it seems to work susprisingly well, and for a specific type of person,
this is definitely bliss.</p>
