<h2 id="windows-server-2025-released">Windows Server 2025 released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-04, from: OS News</p>
<p>Microsoft has confirmed the general availability of Windows Server
2025, which, as a long-term servicing channel (LTSC) release, will be
supported for almost ten years. This article describes some of the
newest developments in Windows Server 2025, which boasts advanced
features that improve security, performance, and flexibility. With
faster storage options and the ability to integrate with hybrid cloud
environments, managing your infrastructure is now more streamlined.
Windows Server 2025 builds on the strong foundation of its predecessor
while introducing a range of innovative enhancements to adapt to your
needs. ↫ What’s new in Windows Server 2025 article It should come as no
surprise that Windows Server 2025 comes loaded with a ton of new
features and improvements. I already covered some of those, such as
DTrace by default, NVMe and storage improvements, hotpatching, and more.
Other new features we haven’t discussed yet are a massive list of
changes and improvements to Active Directory, a feature-on-demand
feature for Azure Arc, support for Bluetooth keyboards, mice, and other
peripherals, and tons of Hyper-V improvements. SMB is also seeing so
many improvements it’s hard to pick just a few to highlight, and
software-defined networking is also touted as a major aspect of Server
2025. With SDN you can separate the network control plane from the data
plane, giving administrators more flexibility in managing their network.
I can just keep going listing all of the changes, but you get the idea –
there’s a lot here. You can try Windows Server 2025 for free for 180
days, as a VM in Azure, a local virtual machine image, or installed
locally through an ISO image.</p>

<h2 id="moving-a-game-project-from-c-to-the-odin-language">Moving a game
project from C to the Odin language</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-04, from: OS News</p>
<p>Some months ago, I got really fed up with C. Like, I don’t hate C.
Hating programming languages is silly. But it was way too much effort to
do simple things like lists/hashmaps and other simple data structures
and such. I decided to try this language called Odin, which is one of
these “Better C” languages. And I ended up liking it so much that I
moved my game Artificial Rage from C to Odin. Since Odin has support for
Raylib too (like everything really), it was very easy to move things
around. Here’s how it all went.. Well, what I remember the very least. ↫
Akseli Lahtinen You programmers might’ve thought you escaped the wrath
of Monday on OSNews, but after putting the IT administrators to work in
my previous post, it’s now time for you to get to work. If you have a C
codebase and want to move it to something else, in this case Odin,
Lahtinen’s article will send you on your way. As someone who barely
knows how to write HTML, it’s difficult for me to say anything
meaningful about the technical details, but I feel like there’s a lot of
useful, first-hand info here.</p>

<h2 id="from-proxmox-to-freebsd-story-of-a-migration">From Proxmox to
FreeBSD: story of a migration</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-04, from: OS News</p>
<p>It’s the start of the work week, so for the IT administrators among
us, I have another great article by friend of the website, Stefano
Marinelli. This article covers migrating a Proxmox-based setup to
FreeBSD with bhyve. The load is not particularly high, and the machines
have good performance. Suddenly, however, I received a notification: one
of the NVMe drives died abruptly, and the server rebooted. ZFS did its
job, and everything remained sufficiently secure, but since it’s a
leased server and already several years old, I spoke with the client and
proposed getting more recent hardware and redoing the setup based on
a FreeBSD host. ↫ Stefano Marinelli If you’re interested in moving one
of your own setups, or one of your clients’ setups, from Linux to
FreeBSD, this is a great place to start and get some ideas, tips, and
tricks. Like I said, it’s Monday, and you need to get to work.</p>

<strong>Opinion</strong>  At the start of September, Transport for
London was hit by a major cyber attack. TfL is the public body that
moves many of London's human bodies to and from work and play in the
capital, and as the attack didn't hit power, signaling, or
communications systems, most of the effects went unnoticed by commuters.
The organization downplayed the damage done to back office ticketing,
billing, and other systems. Everything was in hand.…

fundraising goal reached in less than a week</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>It’s been less than a week, and late Friday night we reached the
fundraiser goal of €2500 (it sat at 102% when I closed it) on Ko-Fi! I’m
incredibly grateful for each and every donation, big or small, and every
new Patreon that joined our ranks. It’s incredible how many of you are
willing to support OSNews to keep it going, and it means the absolute
world to me. Hopefully we’ll eventually reach a point where monthly
Patreon income is high enough so we can turn off ads for everyone, and
be fully free from any outside dependencies. Of course, it’s not just
those that choose to support us financially – every reader matters, and
I’m very thankful for each and every one of you, donor/Patreon or not.
The weekend’s almost over, so back to regular posting business tomorrow.
I wish y’all an awesome Sunday evening.</p>
