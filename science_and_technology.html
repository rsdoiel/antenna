Steam Client stability on Linux: setenv and multithreaded
environments</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-12, from: OS News</p>
<p>Speaking of Steam, the Linux version of Valve’s gaming platform has
just received a pretty substantial set of fixes for crashes, and
Timothee “TTimo” Besset, who works for Valve on Linux support, has
published a blog post with more details about what kind of crashes
they’ve been fixing. The Steam client update on November 5th mentions
“Fixed some miscellaneous common crashes.” in the Linux notes, which I
wanted to give a bit of background on. There’s more than one fix that
made it in under the somewhat generic header, but the one change that
made the most significant impact to Steam client stability on Linux has
been a revamping of how we are approaching
the setenv and getenv functions. One of my colleagues rightly
dubbed setenv “the worst Linux API”. It’s such a simple, common API,
available on all platforms that it was a little difficult to convince
ourselves just how bad it is. I highly encourage anyone who writes
software that will run on Linux at some point to read through
“RachelByTheBay”‘s very engaging post on the subject. ↫ Timothee “TTimo”
Besset This indeed seems to be a specific Linux problem, and due to the
variability in Linux systems – different distributions, extensive user
customisation, and so on – debugging information was more difficult to
parse than on Windows and macOS. After a lot of work grouping the debug
information to try and make sense of it all, it turned out that the two
functions in question were causing issues in threads other than those
that used them. They had to resort to several solutions, from reducing
the reliance setenv and refactoring it with exevpe, to reducing the
reliance on getenv through caching, to introducing “an ‘environment
manager’ that pre-allocates large enough value buffers at startup for
fixed environment variable names, before any threading has started”. It
was especially this last one that had a major impact on reducing the
number of crashes with Steam on Linux. Besset does note that these
functions are still used far too often, but that at this point it’s out
of their control because that usage comes from the libraries of the
operating system, like x11, xcb, dbus, and so on. Besset also mentions
that it would be much better if this issue can be addressed in glibc,
and in the comments, a user by the name of Adhemerval reports that this
is indeed something the glibc team is working on.</p>

<h2 id="valve-ends-steams-support-for-windows-7-and-8">Valve ends
Steam’s support for Windows 7 and 8</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-12, from: OS News</p>
<p>Steam has finally stopped working on several older Windows operating
systems, following a warning from Valve that it planned to drop support
earlier this year. With little fanfare, Windows 7 and Windows 8 gaming
on Steam is no longer possible following the most recent Steam client
update on November 5. ↫ Ben Stockton at PCGamesN It’s honestly wild that
Valve supported Windows 7 and 8 for this long for Steam in the first
place. They’ve been out of support for a long time, and at this point in
time, less than 0.3% of Steam users were using Windows 7 or 8. Investing
any resources in continuing to support them would be financially
irresponsible, while also aiding a tiny bit in allowing people to use
such unsupported, insecure systems to this day. I’m sure at least one of
you is still rocking Windows 7 or 8 as your daily driver operating
system, so I’m sorry if you don’t want to hear this, but it’s really,
really time to move on. Buying a Windows 10 or 11 license on eBay or
whatever costs a few euros at most – if you’re not eligible for one the
free upgrade programs Microsoft ran – and especially Windows 10 should
run just fine on pretty much anything Windows 7 or 8 runs on. Do note
that with Windows 10, though, you’ll be back in the same boat next
year.</p>
