<h2 id="right-to-root-access">Right to root access</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-21, from: OS News</p>
<p>I believe consumers, as a right, should be able to install software
of their choosing to any computing device that is owned outright. This
should apply regardless of the computer’s form factor. In addition to
traditional computing devices like PCs and laptops, this right should
apply to devices like mobile phones, “smart home” appliances, and even
industrial equipment like tractors. In 2025, we’re ultra-connected via a
network of devices we do not have full control over. Much of this has to
do with how companies lock their devices’ bootloaders, prevent root
access, and prohibit installation of software that is not explicitly
sanctioned through approval in their own distribution channels. We
should really work on changing that. ↫ Medhir Bhargava Obviously, this
is preaching to the choir here on OSNews. I agree with Bhargava 100%. It
should be illegal for any manufacturer of computing devices – with a
possible exception for, say, things like medical implants, certain
aspects of car control units, and so on – to lock down and/or restrict
owners’ ability to install whatever software they want, run whatever
code they want, and install whatever operating system they want on the
devices that they own. Computers are interwoven into the very fabric of
every aspect of our society, and having them under the sole control of
the biggest megacorporations in the world is utterly dystopian, and
wildly dangerous. Personally, I would take it a step further: any and
all code that runs on products sold must be open. Not necessarily open
source, but at the very least open, so that it can be inspected when
malice is suspected. This way, society can make sure that the tech
billionaire oligarchs giving nazi salutes aren’t in full, black-box
control over our devices. Secrecy as a means of corporate control is
incredibly dangerous, and forcing all code to be open is the perfect way
to combat this. Copyright is more than enough intellectual property
protection for code. The odds of this happening are, of course, slim,
especially with the aforementioned tech billionaire oligarchs giving
nazi salutes effectively running the most powerful military in human
history. Reason is in short supply these days, and I doubt that’s going
to change any time soon.</p>

RAM</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-20, from: OS News</p>
<p>How do you fit a 250kB dictionary in 64kB of RAM and still perform
fast lookups? For reference, even with modern compression techniques
like gzip -9, you can’t compress this file below 85kB. In the 1970s,
Douglas McIlroy faced this exact challenge while implementing the spell
checker for Unix at AT&amp;T. The constraints of the PDP-11 computer
meant the entire dictionary needed to fit in just 64kB of RAM. A
seemingly impossible task. ↫ Abhinav Upadhyay They still managed to do
it, but had to employ some incredibly clever tricks to make it work, and
make it work fast. Such skillful engineers interested in optimising and
eeking the most possible performance out of underpowered hardware still
exist today, but they’re not in any position to make lasting changes at
any of the companies defining our technology today. Why spend money on
skilled engineers, when you can just throw cheap hardware at the
problem? I wonder just how many resources the spellchecking feature in
Word or LibreOffice Writer takes up.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-to-grapheneos">Introduction to GrapheneOS</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-20, from: OS News</p>
<p>GrapheneOS (written GOS from now on) is an Android based operating
system that focuses security. It is only compatible with Google Pixel
devices for multiple reasons: availability of hardware security
components, long term support (series 8 and 9 are supported at least 7
years after release) and the hardware has a good quality / price ratio.
The goal of GOS is to provide users a lot more control about what their
smartphone is doing. A main profile is used by default (the owner
profile), but users are encouraged to do all their activities in a
separate profile (or multiples profiles). This may remind you about
Qubes OS workflow, although it does not translate entirely here.
Profiles can not communicate between each others, encryption is done per
profile, and some permissions can be assigned per profile (installing
apps, running applications in background when a profile is not used,
using the SIM…). This is really effective for privacy or security
reasons (or both), you can have a different VPN per profile if you want,
or use a different Google Play login, different applications sets,
whatever! The best feature here in my opinion is the ability to
completely stop a profile so you are sure it does not run anything in
the background once you exit it. ↫ Solène Rapenne I switched to
GrapheneOS on my Pixel 8 Pro as part of my process to cleanse myself of
as much Big Tech as possible, and I’ve been incredibly happy with it.
The additional security and privacy control GrapheneOS brings is
amazing, and the fact it opted for a sandboxed Google Play Services
basically means there’s no compatibility issues, unlike when using
microG, where compatibility problems are a fact of life. GrapheneOS’
security and other updates are on par or even faster than the stock
Google Pixel’s Android, and the overall user experience is virtually
identical to stock Android. The only downside is the reliance on Pixel
devices – it’s an understandable choice, but does mean giving money to
Google if you don’t already own a Pixel. A workaround, if you will, is
to buy a used or refurbished Pixel, but that may not always be an option
either. For me personally, I’ll be sticking with my Pixel 8 Pro for a
long time, but if it were to break, I’d most likely go the used Pixel
route to avoid enriching Google. For pretty much anyone reading OSNews,
GrapheneOS would be a great choice, and if you already have a Pixel, I
strongly urge you consider switching.</p>
