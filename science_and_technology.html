<h2 id="maxx-interactive-desktop-2.2.0-released">MaXX Interactive
Desktop 2.2.0 released</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>Late last year, the MaXX Interactive Desktop, the Linux (and BSD)
version of the IRIX desktop, sprung back to life with a new release and
a detailed roadmap. Thanks to a unique licensing agreement with SGI,
MaXX’ developer, Eric Masson, has been able to bring a lot of the SGI
user experience over to Linux and BSD, and as promised, we have a new
release: the final version of MaXX Interactive Desktop 2.2.0. It’s
codenamed Octane, and anyone who knows their SGI history will chuckle at
this and other codenames MaXX uses. Like last year’s alpha release,
2.2.0 brings an Exposé-like overview features, initial freedesktop.org
integration, tons of performance improvements and bug fixes, desktop
notifications, and much more. For the next release, 2.3.0 they’re
planning a new file manager, support for .desktop files, a ton of new
preference panes, a quick search feature, and a whole bunch of
lower-level stuff. With how serious the renewed development effort
seems, I hope that some day, the project will consider building MaXX out
to a full Linux distribution, to gain more control over the experience
and ensure normal users don’t have to perform a manual installation.</p>

<h2 id="why-upstart-from-ubuntu-failed">Why Upstart from Ubuntu
failed</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-04, from: OS News</p>
<p>Upstart was an event-based replacement for the traditional System V
init (sysvinit) system on Ubuntu, introduced to bring a modern and more
flexible way of handling system startup and service management. It
emerged in the mid-2000s, during a period when sysvinit’s age and
limitations were becoming more apparent, especially with regard to
concurrency and dependency handling. Upstart was developed by Canonical,
the company behind Ubuntu, with the aim of reducing boot times,
improving reliability, and making the system initialization process more
dynamic. Though at first it seemed likely to become a standard across
many distributions, Upstart eventually lost mindshare to systemd and
ceased to be Ubuntu’s default init system. ↫ André Machado I think it’s
safe to say systemd won the competition to become the definitive
successor to sysvinit on Linux, but Canonical’s Upstart made a valiant
effort, too. However, with a troublesome license, it was doomed from the
start, and it didn’t help that virtually every other major distribution
eventually adopted systemd. These days, systemd is the Linux init
system, and I personally quite like it (and the crowd turns violent). I
find it easy to use and it’s never given me any issues, but I’m not a
system administrator dealing with complex setups, so my experience with
systemd is probably rather limited. It just does its thing in the
background on my machines. None of this means there aren’t any other
init systems still being actively developed. There’s GNU Shepard we
talked about recently, runit, OpenRC, and many more. If you don’t like
systemd, there’s enough alternatives out there.</p>

id="the-dumb-reason-why-flag-emojis-arent-working-on-your-site-in-chrome-on-windows">The
dumb reason why flag emojis aren’t working on your site in Chrome on
Windows</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-04, from: OS News</p>
<p>After doing more digging than I feel like I should have needed to, I
found my answer: it appears that due to concerns about the fact that
acknowledging the existence of certain countries can be perceived as a
nominally political stance, Microsoft has opted to just avoid the issue
altogether by not including country flag emojis in Windows’ system font.
Problem solved! Can you imagine if, <em>gasp</em>, your computer could
render a Taiwanese or Palestinian flag? The horror! ↫ Ryan Geyer Silicon
Valley corporations are nothing if not massive cowards, and this is just
another one of the many, many examples that underline this. Firefox
solves this by including the flags on its own, but Google refuses to do
the same with Chrome, because, you guessed it, Google is also a cowardly
organisation. There are some ways around it, as the linked article
details, but they’re all clumsy and cumbersome compared to Microsoft
just not being a coward and including proper flag emoji, even if it
offends some sensibilities in pro-China or western far-right circles.
Your best bet to avoid such corporate cowardice is to switch to better
operating systems, like any desktop Linux distribution. Fedora KDE
includes both the Taiwanese and Palestinian flags, because the KDE
project isn’t made up of cowards, and I’m sure the same applies to any
GNOME distribution. If your delicate snowflake sensibilities can’t
handle a Palestinian or Taiwanese flag emoji, just don’t type them.
Bitter sidenote: it turns out WordPress, what OSNews uses, doesn’t like
emoji, either. Adding any emoji in this story, from basic ones to the
Taiwanese or Palestinian flag, makes it impossible to save or publish
the story. I have no idea if this is a WordPress issue, or an issue on
our end, since WordPress does mention they have emoji support.</p>

<h2 id="tuxtape-a-kernel-livepatching-solution">TuxTape: a kernel
livepatching solution</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-04, from: OS News</p>
<p>Geico, an American insurance company, is building a live-patching
solution for the Linux kernel, called TuxTape. TuxTape is an
in-development kernel livepatching ecosystem that aims to aid in the
production and distribution of kpatch patches to vendor-independent
kernels. This is done by scraping the Linux CNA mailing list,
prioritizing CVEs by severity, and determining applicability of the
patches to the configured kernel(s). Applicability of patches is
determined by profiling kernel builds to record which files are included
in the build process and ignoring CVEs that do not affect files included
in kernel builds deployed on the managed fleet. ↫ Presentation by
Grayson Guarino and Chris Townsend It seems to me something like
live-patching the Linux kernel should be a standardised framework that’s
part of the Linux kernel, and not several random implementations by
third parties, one of which is an insurance company. There’s a base core
of functionality for live-patching in the Linux kernel since 4.0,
released in 2015, but it’s extremely limited and requires most of the
functionality to be implemented separately, through things like Red
Hat’s kpatch and Oracle’s Ksplice. Geico is going to release TuxTape as
open source, and is encouraging others to adopt and use it. There are
various other solutions out there offering similar functionality, so
you’re not spoiled for choice, and I’m sure there’s advantages and
disadvantages to each. I would still prefer if functionality like this
is a standard feature of the kernel, not something tied to a specific
vendor or implementation.</p>

By harnessing “squeezed light,” INSPIRED seeks to develop compact, cost-effective optical detectors that can operate at unprecedented sensitivities – allowing signals previously buried in quantum noise to be clearly detected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The promise of squeezed light&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A fundamental concept of quantum mechanics is the Heisenberg principle, which states that due to the inherent nature of quantum systems, it is impossible to simultaneously know both the exact position and momentum of a particle with perfect accuracy – the more precisely one property is known, the greater the uncertainty in the other. With light, the principle also applies to other pairs of properties, such as the amplitude and phase of an electromagnetic wave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Squeezed light is a unique quantum state in which the uncertainty of one of these two properties is reduced below the standard quantum noise limit, while the uncertainty in the other is increased to preserve the Heisenberg principle. This “squeezing” minimizes random noise in measurements, enabling the detection of extremely faint signals that would otherwise be imperceptible. Squeezed light systems were first applied to some of the most precise measurements ever performed to boost the sensitivity of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) – resulting in the first observation of gravitational waves and the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics. These detection systems continue to allow LIGO to capture faint signals from distant cosmic events, such as black holes and neutron star collisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on this success, INSPIRED aims to translate laboratory-based squeezed light techniques into deployable technology. The program is leveraging advancements in chip-scale photonics to develop compact, integrated squeezed-light sources 40 times quieter than the quantum noise limit. These breakthroughs will then enable the creation of highly sensitive detectors that overcome traditional noise barriers, unlocking new possibilities in fields such as sensing, communication, and quantum computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;INSPIRED’s roadmap&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;INSPIRED is organized into two phases over three years. Phase 1 is focused on developing core squeezed-light components, with participation from eight research teams led by Hewlett Packard Enterprise, RTX BBN Technologies, Inc., Stanford University, University of Massachusetts at Amherst, University of California, Santa Barbara, University of Southern California, University of Virginia, and Yale University. To kick off the program, DARPA gathered the INSPIRED teams at the LIGO Hanford Observatory in the southeast of Washington state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By taking squeezed light capabilities out of the lab, we aim to drive breakthroughs across defense, scientific, and commercial applications,” said Dr. Justin Cohen, program manager in DARPA’s Microsystems Technologies Office. “Commencing the INSPIRED program at the LIGO Observatory reflects our commitment to uncovering what’s possible when we push the limits of technology through collaboration and vision.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The anticipated culmination of INSPIRED’s efforts in Phase 2 is a complete squeezed-light detector, housed within a module the size of a deck of cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visit the &lt;a href=&quot;https://drupal.darpa.mil/research/programs/intensity-squeezed-photonic&quot;&gt;INSPIRED program page&lt;/a&gt; for further information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-center&quot;&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-center&quot;&gt;Media with inquiries should contact DARPA Public Affairs at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:outreach@darpa.mil&quot;&gt;outreach@darpa.mil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

id="gtk-announces-x11-deprecation-new-android-backend-and-much-more">GTK
announces X11 deprecation, new Android backend, and much more</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>Since a number of GTK developer came together at FOSDEM, the project
figured now was as good a time as any to give an update on what’s coming
in GTK. First, GTK is implementing some hard cut-offs for old platforms
– Windows 10 and macOS 10.15 are now the oldest supported versions,
which will make development quite a bit easier and will simplify several
parts of the codebase. Windows 10 was released in 2015 and macOS 10.15
in 2019, which are fair cut-off points, in my book. GTK 4.18 will also
bring major accessibility improvements with the AccessKit backend,
giving GTK accessibility features on Windows and macOS for the first
time, which is great news. Another major new feature is the new Android
backend, which, while not yet complete, will allow you to run GTK
applications on Android. Do note that this is experimental, so don’t
expect everything to work without any issues quite yet. Lastly, the news
that everyone was freaking out about over the weekend: the X11 backend
has been deprecated, and will be removed in GTK 5. This freaked a lot of
people out, but note that this doesn’t mean you magically can’t use GTK
4 applications on X11 anymore – it merely means that X11 support will be
removed in GTK 5, which doesn’t even exist yet, and with GTK 4 being
supported until GTK 6 is released, people using legacy windowing systems
like Xorg will be fine for a long time to come. As the GTK project notes
on Fedi: The X11 backend being deprecated mainly means that we’re not
going to spend time implementing new features, like dmabuf, graphics
offloading, or Vulkan support. X11 support will still exist until GTK4
is EOL, which will happen once GTK <em>6</em> is released. We’re talking
about a 20 years horizon, at this point… Of course, somebody could show
up tomorrow, and implement everything that the Wayland backend does, but
for X11. We can always undeprecate things. We are not holding our
breath, though… ↫ The GTK project on Fedi This is the right move, and
I’m glad the GTK project is doing this, and is giving everyone ample
time to prepare. A lot of people will still freak out, get mad, and
scream bloody murder at certain individuals in the wider Linux
community, and those people are, of course, free to start working on
Xorg. Like the GTK developers, though, I’m not holding my breath,
because despite years of excessive Wayland hate, not a single person has
stood up to do the work required to keep Xorg going.</p>

<p>date: 2025-02-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>You might expect PDF files to only be comprised of static documents,
but surprisingly, the PDF file format supports Javascript with its own
separate standard library. Modern browsers (Chromium, Firefox) implement
this as part of their PDF engines. However, the APIs that are available
in the browser are much more limited. The full specfication for the JS
in PDFs was only ever implemented by Adobe Acrobat, and it contains some
ridiculous things like the ability to do 3D rendering, make HTTP
requests, and detect every monitor connected to the user’s system.
However, on Chromium and other browsers, only a tiny subset of this API
was ever implemented, due to obvious security concerns. With this, we
can do whatever computation we want, just with some very limited IO. ↫

<h2 id="the-gnu-guix-system">The GNU Guix System</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>GNU Guix is a package manager for GNU/Linux systems. It is designed
to give users more control over their general-purpose and specialized
computing environments, and make these easier to reproduce over time and
deploy to one or many devices. ↫ GNU Guix website Guix is basically
GNU’s approach to a reproducible, functional package manager, very
similar to Nix because, well, it’s based on Nix. GNU also has a Linux
distribution built around Nix, the GNU Guix System, which is fully
‘libre’ as all things GNU are, and also makes use of the GNU Shepard
init system. Both Shepard and Guix make use of Guile. The last release
of the GNU Guix System is a few years old already, but it’s a rolling
release, so that’s not much of an issue. It uses the Linux kernel, but
support for GNU Hurd is also being worked on, for whatever that’s worth.
There’s also a third-party distribution that is built around the same
projects, called rde. It focuses on being lightweight, ready for offline
use, and minimal distractions. It’s probably not suitable for most
normal users, but if you’re a power user and you’re looking for
something a little bit different, this could be for you. While it’s in
active development, it’s considered usable and stable by its creators. I
haven’t tried it yet, but I’m definitely intrigued by what it has to
offer. Nix sucks up a lot of the attention in this space, so it’s
interesting to see some of the alternatives that aim for similar
goals.</p>
