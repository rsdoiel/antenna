changes which can cause side-effects. Bugs are very possible, especially
in very rarely used features. ↫ WinUAE website Going through the
changelog is dizzying, ranging from an almost complete rewrite of the
main chipset emulation for internal cycle accuracy, to running the
emulation of the Denise/Lisa chips in a separate thread for better
performance, to a ton of fixes and smaller updates.</p>

id="macos-icons-keep-getting-worse-every-time-apple-touches-them">MacOS’
icons keep getting worse every time Apple touches them</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-06, from: OS News</p>
<p>With macOS 26, Apple has announced a dramatically new look to their
UI: Liquid Glass. Solid material icon elements give way to softer,
shinier, glassier icons. The rounded rectangle became slightly more
rounded, and Apple eliminated the ability for icon elements to extend
beyond the icon rectangle (as seen in the current icons for GarageBand,
Photo Booth, Dictionary, etc.). With this release being one of the most
dramatic visual overhauls of macOS’s design, I wanted to begin a
collection chronicling the evolution of the system icons over the years.
I’ve been rolling these out on social media over the past week and will
continue to add to and update this collection slowly over the summer.
Enjoy! ↫ BasicAppleGuy Every single one of these icons is getting
progressively worse with almost every design change. They go from
beautifully crafted, easily readable and supremely distinguishable icons
to generic, repetitive blobs of colour, void of any personality,
artistry, or usability considerations. Also, Apple’s new icon design
language makes the icons look fuzzy, like they’re not being rendered
properly. It’s very unnerving. The one exception is probably the generic
folder icon, which looks fine in all of its incarnations. Then there’s
the classic Platinum, pixelated version from Mac OS 9 and earlier,
which, together with icons from Windows and BeOS from the same time
period, are a whole different style that I don’t think most people would
accept anymore these days, but that I absolutely adore. Mostly I’m just
sad that the craft of making exquisite icons for operating systems is
dying, replaced by what almost look like “AI” generated blobs of
indeterminate meaning, that rely more on preexisting knowledge of the
operating system and its applications in question than on being
recognisable and decipherable by anyone. I truly hope Windows and the
various open source desktops don’t follow in Apple’s footsteps here.</p>

of people, and then to give that final kick when you’re already down,
some asshat manager tells you to “talk to” sparkly autocomplete for
