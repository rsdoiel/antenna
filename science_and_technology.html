id="microsoft-recall-screenshots-credit-cards-and-social-security-numbers-even-with-the-sensitive-information-filter-enabled">Microsoft
Recall screenshots credit cards and Social Security numbers, even with
the “sensitive information” filter enabled</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-16, from: OS News</p>
<p>Microsoft’s Recall feature recently made its way back to Windows
Insiders after having been pulled from test builds back in June, due to
security and privacy concerns. The new version of Recall encrypts the
screens it captures and, by default, it has a “Filter sensitive
information,” setting enabled, which is supposed to prevent it from
recording any app or website that is showing credit card numbers, social
security numbers, or other important financial / personal info. In my
tests, however, this filter only worked in some situations (on two
e-commerce sites), leaving a gaping hole in the protection it promises.
↫ Avram Piltch at Tom’s Hardware Recall might be one of the biggest own
goals I have seen in recent technology history. In fact, it’s more of a
series of own goals that just keep on coming, and I honestly have no
idea why Microsoft keeps making them, other than the fact that they’re
so high on their own “AI” supply that they just lost all touch with
reality at this point. There’s some serious Longhorn-esque tunnel vision
here, a project during which the company also kind of forgot the outside
world existed beyond the walls of Microsoft’s Redmond headquarters. It’s
clear by now that just like many other tech companies, Microsoft is so
utterly convinced it needs to shove “AI” into every corner of its
products, that it no longer seems to be asking the most important
question during product development: do people actually want this? The
response to Windows Recall has been particularly negative, yet Microsoft
keep pushing and pushing it, making all the mistakes along the way
everybody has warned them about. It’s astonishing just how dedicated
they are to a feature nobody seem to want, and everybody seems to warn
them about. It’s like we’re all Kassandra. The issue in question here is
exactly as dumb as you expect it to be. The “Filter sensitive
information” setting is so absurdly basic and dumb it basically only
seems to work on shopping sites, not anywhere else where credit card or
other sensitive information might be shown. This shortcoming is obvious
to anyone who think about what Recall does for more than one nanosecond,
but Microsoft clearly didn’t take a few moments to think about this,
because their response is to let them know through the Feedback Hub any
time Recall fails to detect and sensitive information. They’re basically
asking you, the consumer, to be the filter. Unpaid, of course. After the
damage has already been done. Wild. If you can ditch Windows, you
should. Windows is not a place of honour.</p>

id="fedoras-new-btrfs-sig-should-focus-on-making-btrfs-features-more-accessible">Fedora’s
new Btrfs SIG should focus on making Btrfs’ features more
accessible</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-16, from: OS News</p>
<p>As Michel Lind mentioned back in August, we wanted to form a Special
Interest Group to further the development and adoption of Btrfs in
Fedora. As of yesterday, the SIG is now formed. ↫ Neal Gompa Since I’ve
been using Fedora on all my machines for a while now, I’ve also been
using Btrfs as my one and only file system for just as much time,
without ever experiencing any issues. In fact, I recently ordered four
used 4TB enterprise hard drives (used, yes, but zero SMART issues) to
set up a storage pool whereto I can download my favourite YouTube
playlists so I don’t have to rely on internet connectivity and YouTube
not being shit. I combined the four drives into a single 16TB Btrfs
volume, and it’s working flawlessly. Of course, not having any
redundancy is a terrible idea, but I didn’t care much since it’s just
downloaded YouTube videos. However, it’s all working so flawlessly, and
the four drives were so cheap, I’m going to order another four drives
and turn the whole thing into a 16TB Btrfs volume using one of the Btrfs
RAID profiles for proper redundancy, even if it “costs” me half of the
32TB of total storage. This way, I can also use it as an additional
backup for more sensitive data, which is never a bad thing. The one big
downside here is that all of this has to be set up and configured using
the command line. While that makes sense in a server environment and I
had no issues doing so, I think a product that calls itself Fedora
Workstation (or, in my case, Fedora KDE, but the point stands) should
have proper graphical tools for managing the file system it uses. Fedora
should come with a graphical utility to set up, manage, and maintain
Btrfs volumes, so you don’t have to memorise a bunch of arcane commands.
I know a lot of people get very upset when you even suggest someting
like this, but that’s just elitist nonsense. Btrfs has various
incredibly useful features that should be exposed to users of all kinds,
not just sysadmins and weird nerds – and graphical tools are a great way
to do this. I don’t know exactly what the long-term plans of the new
Btrrfs SIG are going to be, but I think making the useful features of
Btrfs more accessible should definitely be on the list. You shouldn’t
need to be a CLI expert to set up resilient, redundant local storage on
your machine, especially now that the interest in digital
self-sufficiency is increasing.</p>

id="theres-a-market-out-there-for-a-modern-x11motif-based-desktop-distribution">There’s
a market out there for a modern X11/Motif-based desktop
distribution</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>EMWM is a fork of the Motif Window Manager with fixes and
enhancements. The idea behind this is to provide compatibility with
current xorg extensions and applications, without changing the way the
window manager looks and behaves. This includes support for
multi-monitor setups through Xinerama/Xrandr, UFT-8 support with Xft
fonts, and overall better compatibility with software that
requires Extended Window Manager Hints. Additionally a couple of goodies
are available in the separate utilities package: XmToolbox,
a toolchest like application launcher, which reads it’s multi-level menu
structure from a simple plain-text file ~/.toolboxrc, and XmSm, a simple
session manager that provides session configuration, locking and
shutdown/suspend options. ↫ EMWM homepage I had never heard of EMWM, but
I immediately like it. This same developer, Alexander Pampuchin, also
develops XFile, a file manager for X11 which presents the file system as
it actually is, instead of using a bunch of “imaginary” locations to
hide the truth, if you will. On top of that, they also develop XImaging,
a comprehensive image viewer for X11. All of these use the Motif widget
toolkit, focus on plain X11, and run on most Linux distributions and
BSDs. They need to be compiled by the user, most likely. I am convinced
that there is a small but sustainable audience for a modern, up-to-date
Linux distribution (although a BSD would work just as well), that
instead of offering GNOME, KDE, Xfce, or whatever, focuses instead of
delivering a traditional, yet modernised and maintained, desktop
environment and applications using not much more than X11 and Motif,
eschewing more complex stuff like GTK, Qt, systemd, Wayland, and so on.
I would use the hell out of a system that gives me a version of the
Motif-based desktops like CDE from the ’90s, but with some modern
amenities, current hardware support, support for high-resolution
displays, and so on. You can certainly grab bits and bobs left and right
from the web and build something like this from scratch, but not
everyone has the skills and time to do so, yet I think there’s enough
people out there who are craving for something like this. There’s tons
of maintained X11/Motif software out there – it’s just all spread out,
disorganised, and difficult to assemble because it almost always means
compiling it all from scratch, and most people simply don’t have the
time and energy for that. Package this up on a solid Debian, Fedora, or
FreeBSD base, and I think you’ve got quite some users lining up.</p>

with experimental Wayland support released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>After two years of intense development, the third major Linux desktop
environment has released a new version: Xfce 4.20 is here. The major
focus of this release cycle was getting Xfce ready for Wayland, and
they’ve achieved quite a bit of that goal, but support for it is still
experimental. Thanks to Brian and Gaël almost all Xfce components are
able to run on Wayland windowing, while still keeping support for X11
windowing. This major effort was achieved by abstracting away any
X11/Wayland windowing specific calls and making use of Wayland/Wlroots
protocols. A whole new Xfce library, “libxfce4windowing” was introduced
during that process. XWayland will not be required to run any of the
ported Xfce components. ↫ Xfce development team A major gap in Xfce’s
Wayland support is the fact that Xfwm4 has not been ported to Wayland
yet, so the team suggests using Labwc or Wayfire instead if you want to
dive into using Xfce on Wayland. While there are plans to port Xfwm4
over to Wayland, this requires a major restructuring and they’re not
going to set any timelines or expectations for when this will be
completed. Regardless, this is an excellent achievement and solid
progress for Xfce on Wayland, which is pretty much a requirement for
Xfce (and other desktop environments) te remain relevant going forward.
Of course, while Wayland is a major focus this release, there’s a lot
more here, too – and that’s not doing the Xfce developers justice. Xfce
4.20 comes packed with so many new features, enchancements, and bug
fixes across the board that I have no idea where to start. I like the
large number of changes to Thunar, like the ability to use symoblic
icons in the sidebar, optimising it for small window sizes,
automatically opening folders when dragging and dropping, and so much
more. They’ve also done another pass to update any remaining icons not
working well on HiDPI displays, removing any instances where you’d
encounter fuzzy icons. I can’t wait to give Xfce 4.20 a go once it lands
in Fedora Xfce.</p>
