<h2 id="microsoft-just-delayed-recall-again">Microsoft just delayed
Recall again</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-01, from: OS News</p>
<p>Another day, another Windows Recall problem. Microsoft is delaying
the feature yet again, this time from October to December. “We are
committed to delivering a secure and trusted experience with Recall. To
ensure we deliver on these important updates, we’re taking additional
time to refine the experience before previewing it with Windows
Insiders,” says Brandon LeBlanc, senior product manager of Windows, in a
statement to The Verge. “Originally planned for October, Recall will now
be available for preview with Windows Insiders on Copilot Plus PCs by
December.” ↫ Tom Warren at The Verge Making Recall secure, opt-in, and
uninstallable is apparently taking more time than the company originally
planned. When security, opt-in, and uninstallable are not keywords
during your design and implementation process for new features, this is
the ungodly mess that you end up with. This could’ve all been prevented
if Microsoft wasn’t high on its own “AI” supply.</p>

thinks “AI” is 90% marketing, and Google claims 25% of its code is
“AI”-generated</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-01, from: OS News</p>
<p>Torvalds said that the current state of AI technology is 90 percent
marketing and 10 percent factual reality. The developer, who won
Finland’s Millennium Technology Prize for the creation of the Linux
kernel, was interviewed during the Open Source Summit held in Vienna,
where he had the chance to talk about both the open-source world and the
latest technology trends. ↫ Alfonso Maruccia at Techspot Well, he’s not
wrong. “AI” definitely feels like a bubble at the moment, and while
there’s probably eventually going to be useful implementations people
might actually want to actively use to produce quality content, most
“AI” features today produce a stream of obviously fake diarrhea full of
malformed hands, lies, and misinformation. Maybe we’ll eventually work
out these serious kinks, but for now, it’s mostly just a gimmick
providing us with an endless source of memes. Which is fun, but not
exactly what we’re being sold, and not something worth destroying the
planet for even faster. Meanwhile, Google is going utterly bananas with
its use of “AI” inside the company, with Sundar Pichai claiming 25% of
code inside Google is now “AI”-generated. ↫ Sundar Pichai We’re also
using AI internally to improve our coding processes, which is boosting
productivity and efficiency. Today, more than a quarter of all new code
at Google is generated by AI, then reviewed and accepted by engineers.
This helps our engineers do more and move faster. So much here feels
wrong. First, who wants to bet those engineers care a whole lot less
about the generated code than they do about code they write themselves?
Second, who wants to bet that generated code is entirely undocumented?
Third, who wants to bet what the additional costs will be a few years
from now when the next batch of engineers tries to make sense of that
undocumented generated code? Sure, Google might save a bit on engineers’
salaries now, but how much extra will they have to spend to
unspaghettify that diarrhea code in the future? It will be very
interesting to keep an eye on this, and check back in, say, five years,
and hear from the Google engineers of the future how much of their time
is spent fixing undocumented “AI”-generated code. I can’t wait.</p>

id="gnome-and-kde-working-on-end-user-focused-official-linux-distributions-not-entirely-without-risks">GNOME
and KDE working on end user-focused “official” Linux distributions, not
entirely without risks</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-31, from: OS News</p>
<p>It seems the GNOME team is getting quite serious about turning GNOME
OS into an end-user focused Linux distribution, similar to a project KDE
is working on. GNOME OS is GNOME’s development, testing, and QA
distribution. It’s not designed to be useful as a general-purpose
system, and so it hasn’t been the center of attention. However, that
makes it a convenient place to experiment, and ultimately through sheer
coincidence the GNOME OS team ended up developing something that follows
my vision using the same technology that I was. The only real difference
was intent: carbonOS was intended for mass adoption, and GNOME OS was
not. In essentially every other aspect, the projects had the same
roadmap: following Lennart Poettering’s “Fitting Everything
Together” proposal, providing a stock GNOME experience, and even using
the same build system (BuildStream). ↫ Adrian Vovk The goal with GNOME
OS is to showcase the best GNOME has to offer, built on top of an
immutable base system, using Flatpak as the means to install
applications. Basically, we’re looking at something very similar to the
immutable Fedora GNOME variant, but probably with even less
modifications to stock GNOME, and perhaps with few more newer things as
default, like perhaps systemd-boot over GRUB. KDE also happens to be
working on a very similar project, with many of the same design choices
and constraints. I think this is an excellent idea, for both GNOME and
KDE. This allows them to offer users a very focused, simple, and
resilient way of showcasing the latest and greatest the two desktop
environments have to offer, without having to rely on third-party
distributions to not make silly choices or mess things up – for which
GNOME and KDE developers then tend to take the heat. Systems like these
will, of course, also be a great way for developers to quickly spin up
the latest stock versions of GNOME and KDE to test their applications.
Still, there’s also a downside to having official GNOME and KDE
distributions. If users find bugs or issues in these desktop environment
when running other distributions, like Fedora or Ubuntu, GNOME and KDE
developers may be tempted to just shrug them off and point them to the
official GNOME and KDE distributions. It works there, so obviously the
cause of the bug lies with the unofficial distribution, right? This may
be a tempting conclusion, but may not be accurate at all, as the real
cause could still lie with GNOME and KDE. Once such “official” GNOME and
KDE Linux distributions exist, the projects run a real risk of only
really caring about how well GNOME and KDE work there, while not caring
as much, or even at all, how well they run everywhere else. I’m not sure
how they intend to prevent this from happening, but from here, I can
already see the drama erupting. I hope this is something they take into
consideration. Immutable distributions are not for me, since I prefer
the control regular Fedora and RPM gives me, and I don’t want to give
that up. It also doesn’t help I really, really don’t like Flatpak as it
exists today, which is another major barrier to entry for someone like
me, and I assume most OSNews readers. However, there are countless Linux
users out there who just want to get stuff done with whatever defaults
come with their operating system, and for them, this newly proposed
GNOME OS and its KDE counterpart are a great choice. There’s a reason
Valve opted for an Arch-based immutable KDE distribution for the Steam
Deck, after all.</p>

id="microsoft-isnt-secretly-installing-recall-on-your-windows-pc">Microsoft
isn’t secretly installing Recall on your Windows PC</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-31, from: OS News</p>
<p>There’s been more controversy regarding Microsoft’s Recall feature
for Windows, with people supposedly discovering Recall was being
secretly installed on Windows 11 24H2. Furthermore, trying to remove
this secretly installed Recall would break Explorer, as it seemed
Explorer had a dependency on Recall. Unsurprisingly, this spread like
wildfire all across the web, but I didn’t report on it because something
about it felt off – reports were sporadic and vague, and there didn’t
seem to be any consistency in the various stories. Well, it turns out
that it is a big misunderstanding arising from Microsoft’s usual
incompetence. “Ever since the Recall security fiasco in summer, all
insider and production builds lack Recall completely,” explains Windows
watcher Albacore, in messages to The Verge. Albacore created
the Amperage tool that allowed Recall to run on older Snapdragon chips.
The references we’re seeing in current installs of 24H2 are related to
Microsoft making it easier for system admins to remove Recall or disable
it. “Ironically, Microsoft going out of its way to make removal easier
is being flipped into AI / spying / whatever hoaxes,” says Albacore.
“Microsoft has an ungodly complex and long winded system for integrating
development changes into a mainline build, parts of the optional-izing
work were most likely not merged at once, and thus produce crash loops
in very specific scenarios that slipped testing,” explains Albacore. ↫
Tom Warren at The Verge What this story really highlights is just how
little trust Microsoft has left with its very own users. Microsoft has a
history of silently and secretely re-enabling features users turned off,
re-installing Edge without any user interaction or consent, lots of
disabled telemetry features suddenly being turned on again after an
update, and so on. Over the years, this has clearly eroded any form of
trust users have in Microsoft, so when a story like this hits, users
just assume it’s Microsoft doing shady stuff again. Can you blame them?
All of this is made worse by the absolutely dreadfully bad messaging and
handling of the Recall feature. The shoddy implementation, the complete
lack of security, the severe inability to read the room about the
privacy implications of a feature like Recall, combined with the lack of
trust mentioned above, and you have a very potent cocktail of
misinformation entirely of Microsoft’s own making. I’m not trying to
excuse Microsoft here – they themselves are the only ones to blame for
stories like these. I have a feeling we’re going to see a lot more
Recall problems.</p>

is the weirdest timezone</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-30, from: OS News</p>
<p>The standard trope when talking about timezones is to rattle off
falsehoods programmers believe about them. These lists are only somewhat
enlightening – it’s really hard to figure out what truth is just from
the contours of falsehood. So here’s an alternative approach. I’m gonna
show you some weird timezones. In fact, the weirdest timezones. They’re
each about as weird as timezones are allowed to get in some way. ↫
Ulysse Carion The reason why timezones are often weird is not only
things like the shape of countries dictating where the actual timezones
begin and end, but also because of politics. A lot of politics. The
entirety of China runs on Beijing time, even though it covers five
geographical timezones. Several islands in the Pacific were forced by
their colonisers to run on insanely offset timezones because it made
exploiting them easier. Time in Europe is political, too – countries
like The Netherlands, Belgium, France, and Spain should really be in the
same time zone as the UK, but adopted UTC+1 because it aligns better
with the rest of mainland Europe. Although anything is better than
whatever the hell Dutch Time was. Then there is, of course, daylight
savings, which is a whole pointless nightmare in and of itself that
should be abolished. Daylight savings rules and exceptions alone cover a
ton of the oddities and difficulties with timezones, which is reason
enough to get rid of it, aside from all the other possible issues, but a
proposal to abolish it in the EU has sadly stalled.</p>

<h2 id="improving-xwayland-window-resizing">Improving Xwayland window
resizing</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-30, from: OS News</p>
<p>Speaking of Wayland, one of the most important parts of the
transition is Xwayland, which makes sure legacy X applications not yet
capable of running under a modern graphics stack can continue to
function. Xwayland applications have had this weird visual glitch during
resize operations, however, where the opposite side of the window would
expand and contract while resizing. KDE developer Vlad Zahorodnii wanted
to fix this, and he wrote a very detailed article explaining why,
exactly, this bug happens, which takes you deep into the weeds of X and
Wayland. Window resizing in X would be a glitchy mess, if it wasn’t for
the X11 protocol to synchronize window repaints during interactive
resize, which ensures that the window resize and the application
repainting its window contents remain synchronised. This protocol is
supported by Kwin and GNOME’s Mutter, so what’s the problem here?
Shouldn’t everything just work? KWin supports the basic frame
synchronization protocol, so there should be no visual glitches when
resizing X11 windows in the Plasma Wayland session, right? At quick
glance, yes, but we forget about the most important detail: Wayland
compositors don’t
use XCompositeNameWindowPixmap() or xcb_composite_name_window_pixmap() to
grab the contents of X11 windows, instead they rely on Xwayland
attaching graphics buffers to wl_surface objects, so there is no strict
order between the Wayland compositor receiving an XSync request
acknowledgement and graphics buffers for the new window size. ↫ Vlad
Zahorodnii Basically, the goal of the fix is to make sure these steps
are also synchronised when using Xwayland, and that’s exactly what
Zahorodnii has achieved. This makes the resizing X windows under
Xwayland look normal and without weird visual glitches, which is a
massive improvement to the overall experience of using a Wayland desktop
with a few stray X applications. Thanks to this fix, which was made
possible with help from Wayland developers, Kwin is now one of the few
compositors that correctly synchronises X windows running under Wayland.
KDE has been doing an amazing job moving from X to Wayland, and I don’t
think there’s anyone else who has managed to make the transition quite
as painless. Not only do KDE developers focus on difficult bugs like
this one that many others would just shrug off as acceptable jank, they
also made things like the Wayland to X11 Video Bridge, a
desktop-agnostic tool to allow things like screen sharing in Teams,
Discord, Slack, etc. to work properly on Wayland.</p>

<h2 id="new-raspberry-pi-os-switches-everyone-over-to-wayland">New
Raspberry Pi OS switches everyone over to Wayland</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-30, from: OS News</p>
<p>The slow rise of Wayland hasn’t really been slow anymore for years
now, and today another major part of the Linux ecosystem is making the
jump from X to Wayland. So we made the decision to switch. For most of
this year, we have been working on porting labwc to the Raspberry Pi
Desktop. This has very much been a collaborative process with the
developers of both labwc and wlroots: both have helped us immensely with
their support as we contribute features and optimisations needed for our
desktop. After much optimisation for our hardware, we have reached the
point where labwc desktops run just as fast as X on older Raspberry Pi
models. Today, we make the switch with our latest desktop
image: Raspberry Pi Desktop now runs Wayland by default across all
models. ↫ Simon Long Raspberry Pi Desktop already used Wayland on some
of the newer models, through the use of Wayfire. However, it turned out
Wayfire wasn’t a good fit for the older Pi models, and Wayfire’x
development direction would move it even further away from that goal,
which is obviously important to the Raspberry Pi Foundation. They
eventually settled on using labwc instead, which can also be used on
older Pi models. As such, all Pi models will now switch to using Wayland
with the latest update to the operating system. This new update also
brings vastly improved touchscreen support, a rewritten panel
application that won’t keep removed plugins in memory, a new display
configuration utility, and more.</p>

<h2 id="the-osnews-2024-fundraiser-support-osnews-to-keep-it-alive">The
OSNews 2024 fundraiser: support OSNews to keep it alive</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>Do you want OSNews to continue to exist? Do you like the selection of
news items I manage to scrounge up almost every day? Do you want OSNews
free from corporate influence, “AI”-generated nonsense, and the kind of
SEO-optimised blogspam we all despise? Consider supporting OSNews
financially, so I can keep running the site as an independent entity,
free from the forces that make the web shittier every day. There are
several ways you can support OSNews. First, you can become a Patreon.
Being an OSNews Patreon means no more ads on OSNews, access to the
OSNews Matrix room, and some fancy flair on your comments. The goal is
to eventually have enough Patreons supporting us to make us independent
even from regular ads, which means we’ll need to hit at least
€1500-€2000 a month. Once we achieve that, we will turn off ads for
everyone. OSNews is my job, and thus my only source of income, so we can
only turn off ads once community support is high enough to do so. This
is obviously a long-term goal. To help us all get there, I’ve added a
brand new, even higher Patreon tier. If being a Platinum Patreon isn’t
enough for you, you can now move on up and become an Antimatter Patreon
for €50/month. You’ll get all the same benefits as the Platinum tier,
but on top of that, you can opt to have your name permanently displayed
on the frontpage in our sidebar. This tier is really specifically
designed for the most hardcore supporters of OSNews, and can even be
used as a bit of a marketing tool for yourself. By the way, I do not
know where to go after antimatter. What’s rarer and more expensive than
antimatter? Second, you can make an individual donation to OSNews
through Ko-Fi. Recently, my wife, two kids, and I were all hit with, in
order, bronchitis, flu, and then a minor cold. With all of us down and
out, unable to work, our finances obviously took a bit of a hit. My wife
works in home care for the elderly, which isn’t exactly a job with a
fair wage, so any time we can’t work it hits us hard. Individual Ko-Fi
donations have proven to be lifesavers. As such, I’ve set up a Ko-Fo
donation target of €2500, so my wife, kids, and I can build up a bit of
a buffer for emergencies. Creating such a buffer will be a huge load off
our backs. Third, we have official OSNews merch! Our merch store is
filled with a ton of fun products for the operating system connoisseurs
among us, from the basic OSNews T-shirt and mug, to the old-school
ASCII-art OSNews T-shirt and sweatshirt, and finally three unique
terminal T-shirts showing the terminal of MS-DOS, BeOS, and Mac OS X.
Each of the terminal shirts sport the correct colour schemes, text, and
fonts. The pricing has been set up in such a way that for each product
sold, we receive about $8. OSNews has always been a passion project for
everyone involved, and I’d like to continue that. By making sure we’re
independent, free from the forces that are destroying websites left,
right, and centre, OSNews can keep doing what it’s always done: report
on things nobody else covers, without the pressure to post 45 items
about every new iPhone, stupid SEO blogspam nonsense about how to plug
in a USB cable or whatever, or “AI”-generated drudgery. The people
making that possible are all of our Patreons, Ko-Fi donors, and merch
customers. You have no idea how thankful I am for each and every one of
you.</p>

R14.1.3 released, and KDE developers hold impromptu TDE installfest at
Akademy 2024</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>The Trinity Desktop Environment, a fork of the last release in the
KDE 3.x series, has just released their latest version, R14.1.3. Despite
its rather small version number change, it contains some very welcome
new features. TDE started the process of integrating the XDG Desktop
Portal API, which will bring a lot of welcome integration with
applications from the wider ecosystem. There’s also a brand new touchpad
settings module, which was something I was sorely missing when I tried
out TDE a few months ago. Furthermore, there’s of course a ton of
bugfixes and improvements, but also things like support for tiling
windows, some new theme and colour scheme options, and a lot more. Not
too long ago, when KDE’s Akademy 2024 took place, a really fun impromptu
event happened. A number of KDE developers got together – I think in a
restaurant or coffee place – and ended up organising an unplanned TDE
installation party. Several photos floated around Mastodon of KDE
developers using TDE, and after a few fun interactions between KDE and
TDE developers on Mastodon, TDE developers ended up being invited to
next year’s Akademy. We’ll have to wait and see if the schedules line
up, but if any of this can lead to both projects benefiting from some
jolly cooperation, it can only be seen as a good thing. Regardless, TDE
is an excellent project with a very clear goal, and they’re making
steady progress all the time. It’s not a fast-paced environment chasing
the latest and greatest technologies, but instead builds upon a solid
foundation, bringing it into modern world where it makes sense. If you
like KDE 3.x, TDE is going to be perfect for you.</p>

<h2 id="worlds-first-haiku-ransomwaremalware">World’s first Haiku
ransomware/malware</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>There’s many ways to judge if an operating system has made it to the
big leagues, and one of the more unpleasant ones is the availability of
malware. Haiku, the increasingly capable and daily-driveable successor
to BeOS, is now officially a mainstream operating system, as it just had
its first piece of malware. HaikuRansomware is an experimental
ransomware project designed for educational and investigative purposes.
Inspired by the art of poetry and the challenge of cryptography, this
malware encrypts files with a custom extension and provides a ransom
note with a poetic touch. This is a proof of concept aimed to push the
boundaries of how creative ransomware can be designed. ↫
HaikuRansomware’s GitHub page Now this is obviously a bit of a
tongue-in-cheek, experimental kind of thing, but it’s still something
quite unique to happen to Haiku. I’m not entirely sure how the
ransomware is supposed to spread, but my guess would be through social
engineering. With Haiku being a relatively small project, and one
wherein every user runs as root – baron, in BeOS parlance – I’m sure
anything run through social engineering can do some serious damage
without many guardrails in place. Don’t quote me on that, though, as
Haiku may have more advanced guardrails and mitigations in place than
classic BeOS did. This proof-of-concept has no ill intent, and is more
intended as an art project to highlight what you can do with encryption
and ransomware on Haiku today, and I definitely like the art-focused
approach of the author.</p>

<h2 id="whats-new-in-posix-2024-xcu">What’s new in POSIX 2024 – XCU</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-27, from: OS News</p>
<p>As of the previous release of POSIX, the Austin Group gained more
control over the specification, having it be more working group
oriented, and they got to work making the POSIX specification more
modern. POSIX 2024 is the first release that bears the fruits of this
labor, and as such, the changes made to it are particularly interesting,
as they will define the direction of the specification going forwards.
This is what this article is about! Well, mostly. POSIX is composed of a
couple of sections. Notably XBD (Base Definitions, which talk about
things like what a file is, how regular expressions work, etc), XSH
(System Interfaces, the C API that defines POSIX’s internals), and XCU
(which defines the shell command language, and the standard utilities
available for the system). There’s also XRAT, which explains the
rationale of the authors, but it’s less relevant for our purposes today.
XBD and XRAT are both interesting as context for XSH and XCU, but those
are the real meat of the specification. This article will focus on the
XCU section, in particular the utilities part of that section. If you’re
more interested in the XSH section, there’s an excellent summary page
by sortix’s Jonas Termansen that you can read here. ↫ im tosti The
weekend isn’t over yet, so here’s some more light reading.</p>

<h2 id="the-mips-thinkpad-and-the-unreleased-commodore-hhc-4">The MIPS
‘ThinkPad’ and the unreleased Commodore HHC-4</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-27, from: OS News</p>
<p>Old Vintage Computing Research, by the incredibly knowledgeable
Cameron Kaiser, is one of the best resources on the web about genuinely
obscure retrocomputing, often diving quite deep in topics nobody else
covers – or even can cover, considering how rare some of the hardware
Kaiser covers is. I link to Old VCR all the time, and today I’ve got two
more great articles by Kaiser for you. First, we’ve got the more
well-known – relatively speaking – of the two devices covered today, and
that’s the MIPS ThinkPad, officially known as the IBM WorkPad z50. This
was a Windows CE 2.11 device powered by a NEC VR4120 MIPS processor,
running at 131 Mhz, released in 1999. Astute readers might note the
WorkPad branding, which IBM also used for several rebranded Palm Pilots.
Kaiser goes into his usual great detail covering this device, with tons
of photos, and I couldn’t stop reading for a second. There’s so much
good information in here I have no clue what to highlight, but since
OSNews has OS in the name, this section makes sense to focus on: The
desktop shortcuts are pre-populated in ROM along with a whole bunch of
applications. The marquee set that came on H/PC Pro machines was
Microsoft Pocket Office (Pocket Word, Pocket Excel, Pocket Access and
Pocket PowerPoint), Pocket Outlook (Calendar, Contacts, Inbox and Tasks)
and Pocket Internet Explorer, but Microsoft also included Calculator,
InkWriter (not too useful on the z50 without a touch screen), Microsoft
Voice Recorder, World Clock, ActiveSync (a la Palm HotSync), PC Link
(direct connect, not networked), Remote Networking, Terminal (serial
port and modem), Windows Explorer and, of course, Solitaire. IBM
additionally licensed and included some of bSquare’s software suite,
including bFAX Pro for sending and receiving faxes with the softmodem,
bPRINT for printing and bUSEFUL Backup Plus for system backups, along
with a battery calibrator and a Rapid Access quick configuration tool.
There is also a CMD.EXE command shell, though it too is smaller and less
functional than its desktop counterpart. ↫ Old Vintage Computing
Research Using especially these older versions of Windows CE is a wild
experience, because you can clearly tell Microsoft was trying really
hard to make it look and feel like ‘normal’ Windows, but as anyone who
used Windows CE back then can attest, it was a rather poor imitation
with a ton of weird limitations and design decisions borne from the
limited hardware it was designed to run on. I absolutely adore the
various incarnations of Windows CE and associated graphical shells it
ran – especially the PocketPC days – but there’s no denying it always
felt quite clunky. Moving on, the second Old VCR article I’m covering
today is more difficult for me to write about, since I am too young to
have any experience with the 8 bit era – save for some experience with
the MSX platform as a wee child – so I have no affinity for machines
like the Commodore 64 and similar machines from that era. And, well,
this article just so happens to be covering something called the
Commodore HHC-4. Once upon a time (and that time was Winter CES 1983),
Commodore announced what was to be their one and only handheld computer,
the Commodore HHC-4. It was never released and never seen again, at
least not in that form. But it turns out that not only did the HHC-4
actually exist, it also wasn’t manufactured by Commodore — it was a
Toshiba. Like Superman had Clark Kent, the Commodore HHC-4 had a secret
identity too: the Toshiba Pasopia Mini IHC-8000, the very first portable
computer Toshiba ever made. And like Clark Kent was Superman with
glasses, compare the real device to the Commodore marketing photo and
you can see that it’s the very same machine modulo a plastic palette
swap. Of course there’s more to the story than that. ↫ Old Vintage
Computing Research Of course, Kaiser hunted down an IHC-8000, and
details his experiences with the little handheld, calculator-like
machine. It turns out it’s most likely using some unspecified in-house
Toshiba architecture, running at a few hundred kHz, and it’s apparently
quite sluggish. It never made it to market in Commodore livery, most
likely because of its abysmal performance. The amount of work required
to make this little machine more capable and competitive probably
couldn’t be recouped by its intended list price, Kaiser argues.</p>
