<h2 id="samsung-removes-bootloader-unlocking-with-one-ui-8">Samsung
removes bootloader unlocking with One UI 8</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>Have a Samsung phone (outside of the United States), and want to
unlock the bootloader? Well, soon you won’t be able to do so anymore, as
Samsung seems to be removing this option from their phones – including
already sold models being upgraded to One UI 8. Bootloader unlocking is
a popular way to breathe new life into older devices, by loading
unofficial software onto a device, like custom ROMs, gaining root
access, custom kernels, etc. This option will be taken away from users
with One UI 8. This means not only is the OEM Unlock not visible in
Settings anymore, but the bootloader doesn’t even contain any of the
code required to unlock itself. This means a workaround to brute force
it open is not possible at all, unless Samsung updates the bootloader to
add this logic back in. ↫ Josh Skinner at SammyGuru And so, the ongoing
process of locking down Android to a point where it becomes nigh-on
indistinguishable from iOS’ locked-down, anti-user nature continues
unabated. Samsung is the default choice for Android users in a lot of
places around the world, and seeing them, too move ever closer to fully
locking down their phones is terrible news for consumers. We should be
striving for less restrictive computing, not more. Combined with
persistent rumours that Google is looking into effectively taking
Android closed source, leaving only a stub AOSP behind, the future of
Android as an least somewhat “open” platform looks quite grim
indeed.</p>
