id="google-requires-android-applications-on-google-play-to-support-16-kb-page-sizes">Google
requires Android applications on Google Play to support 16 KB page
sizes</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-08, from: OS News</p>
<p>About a year ago, we talked about the fact that Android 15 became
page size-agnostic, supporting both 4 KB and 16 KB page sizes. Google
was already pushing developers to get their applications ready for 16 KB
page sizes, which means recompiling for 16 KB alignment and testing on a
16 KB version of an Android device or simulator. Google is taking the
next step now, requiring that every application targeting Android 15 or
higher submitted to Google Play after 1 November 2025 must support a
page size of 16 KB. This is a key technical requirement to ensure your
users can benefit from the performance enhancements on newer devices and
prepares your apps for the platform’s future direction of improved
performance on newer hardware. Without recompiling to support 16 KB
pages, your app might not function correctly on these devices when they
become more widely available in future Android releases. ↫ Dan Brown on
the Android Developers Blog This is mostly only relevant for developers
instead of users, but in the extremely unlikely scenario that one of
your favourite applications cannot be made to work with 16 KB page sizes
for some weird reason, or the developer refuses to support it or some
even weirder reason, you might have to say goodbye to that applications
if you use Android 15 or higher. This is absurdly unlikely, but I
wouldn’t be surprised if it happens to at least one application. If that
happens, I want to know which application that is, and ask the developer
for their story.</p>

Garden</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-08, from: OS News</p>
<p>I’ve “launched” the Mac Themes Garden! It is a website showcasing
more than 3,000 (and counting) Kaleidoscope from the Classic Mac era,
ready to be seen, downloaded and explored! Check it out! Oh, and there
also is an RSS feed you can subscribe to see themes as they are
added/updated! ↫ Damien Erambert If you’ve spent any time on
retrocomputing-related social media channels, you’ve definitely seen the
old classic Mac OS themes in your timeline. They are exquisitely
beautiful artifacts of a bygone era, and the work Damien Erambert has
been doing to make these easily available and shareable, entirely in his
free time, is awesome and a massive service to the retrocomputing
community. The process to get these themes loaded up onto the website is
actually a lot more involved than you might imagine. It involves a
classic Mac OS virtual machine, applying themes, taking screenshots,
collecting creator information, and adding everything to a database.
This process is mostly manual, and Erambart estimates he’s about halfway
done. If you have classic Mac OS running somewhere, on real hardware or
in a virtual machine, you can now easily theme it at your heart’s
content.</p>

changes pre-production driver signing, ends the device metadata
service</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>As the headline suggests, we’re going to be talking about some very
dry Windows stuff that only affects a relatively small number of people,
but for those people this is a big deal they need to address. If you’re
working on pre-production drivers that need to be signed, this is
important to you. The Windows Hardware Program supports partners signing
drivers for use in pre-production environments. The CA that is used to
sign the binaries for use in pre-production environments on the Windows
Hardware Program is set to expire in July 2025, following which a new CA
will be used to sign the preproduction content starting June 9, 2025. ↫
Hardware Dev Center Alongside the new CA come a bunch of changes to the
rules. First and foremost, expiry of signed drivers will no longer be
tied to the expiry of the underlying CA, so any driver signed with the
new CA will not expire, regardless of what happens to the CA. In
addition, on April 22, May 13, and June 10, 2025, Windows servicing
releases (4D/5B/6B) will be shipped to Windows versions (down to Windows
Server 2008) to replace the old CAs with the new ones. As such, if
you’re working on pre-production drivers, you need to install those
Latest Cumulative updates. On a very much related note, Microsoft has
announced it’s retiring device metadata and the Windows Metadata and
Internet Services (WMIS). This is what allowed OEMs and device makers to
include things like device names, custom device icons, and other
information in the form of an XML file. While OEMs can no longer create
new device metadata this way, existing metadata already installed on
Windows clients will remain functional. As a replacement for this
functionality, Microsoft points to the driver’s INF files, where such
information and icons can also be included. Riveting stuff.</p>

Environment from openSUSE, after the project’s packager for openSUSE was
found to have added workaround specifically to bypass various security
requirements openSUSE has in place for RPM packages. Recently we noticed
a policy violation in the packaging of the Deepin desktop environment in
openSUSE. To get around security review requirements, our Deepin
community packager implemented a workaround which bypasses the regular
RPM packaging mechanisms to install restricted assets. As a result of
this violation, and in the light of the difficult history we have with
Deepin code reviews, we will be removing the Deepin Desktop packages
from openSUSE distributions for the time being. ↫ Matthias Gerstner
Matthias Gerstner goes into great detail to lay out every single time
the openSUSE team found massive, glaring security issues in Deepin, and
the complete lack of adequate responses from the Deepin upstream team
over the past 8 or so years. It’s absolutely shocking to see how utterly
lax the Deepin developers have been regarding the security of their
desktop environment and its dependencies, and the openSUSE team could
really only come to one harsh conclusion: Deepin has no security culture
whatsoever, and it’s extremely likely that every corner of the Deepin
code is riddled with very serious security issues. As such, despite the
relatively large number of Deepin users on openSUSE, the team has
decided to remove Deepin from openSUSE entirely, instead pointing users
to a third-party repository if they desire to keep using Deepin. I think
this is the best possible option in this situation, but it’s not exactly
ideal. After reading this entire saga, however, I don’t think anyone who
cares about security should be using Deepin. Of course, I doubt this
will be the end of the story. What about all the other Linux
distributions out there? The security issues in Deepin itself are most
likely also present in Debian, Fedora, and other distributions who have
the Deepin Desktop Environment in their repositories, but what about the
workaround to bypass packaging security practices? Does that exist
elsewhere as well? I think we’re about to find out.</p>

bans “AI” security reports as Zuckerberg claims we’ll all have more “AI”
friends than real ones</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>Daniel Stenberg, creator and maintainer of curl, has had enough of
the neverending torrent of “AI”-generated security reports the curl
project has to deal with. That’s it. I’ve had it. I’m putting my foot
down on this craziness. 1. Every reporter submitting security reports on
Hackerone for curl now needs to answer this question: “Did you use an AI
to find the problem or generate this submission?” (and if they do select
it, they can expect a stream of proof of actual intelligence follow-up
questions) 2. We now ban every reporter INSTANTLY who submits reports we
deem AI slop. A threshold has been reached. We are effectively being
DDoSed. If we could, we would charge them for this waste of our time. We
still have not seen a single valid security report done with AI help. ↫
Daniel Stenberg This is the real impact of “AI”: streams of digital
trash real humans have to clean up. While proponents of “AI” keep
claiming it will increase productivity, actual studies show this not to
be the case. Instead, what “AI” is really doing is create more work for
others to deal with by barfing useless garbage into other people’s
backyards. It’s like the digital version of the western world sending
its trash to third-world countries to deal with. The best possible sign
that “AI” is a toxic trash heap you wouldn’t want to have anything to do
with are the people fighting for team “AI”. In Zuckerberg’s vision for a
new digital future, artificial-intelligence friends outnumber human
companions and chatbot experiences supplant therapists, ad agencies and
coders. AI will play a central role in the human experience, the
Facebook co-founder and CEO of Meta Platforms has said in a series of
recent podcasts, interviews and public appearances. ↫ Meghan Bobrowsky
at the WSJ Mark Zuckerberg, who built his empire by using people’s
photos without permission so he could rank who was hotter, who used
Facebook logins to break into journalists’ email accounts because they
were about to publish a negative story about him, who called Facebook
users “dumb fucks” for entrusting their personal information to him, is
on the forefront fighting for “AI”. If that isn’t the ultimate proof
there’s something deeply wrong and ethically unsound about “AI”, I don’t
know what is.</p>

<h2 id="tdes-qt-3-fork-drops-the-3">TDE’s Qt 3 fork drops the 3</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>The Trinity Desktop Environment, the continuation of the final KDE
3.x release updated and maintained for modern times, consists of more
than just the KDE bits you may think of. The project also maintains a
fork of Qt 3 called TQt3, which it obviously needs to be able to work on
and improve TDE itself, which is based on it. In the beginning, this
fork consisted mainly of renaming things, but in recent years, more
substantial changes meant that the code diverged considerably from the
original Qt 3. As such, a small name change is in order. TQt3 was born
as a fork of Qt3 and for many years it was little more than a mere
renaming effort. Over the past few years, many changes were made and the
code has significantly diverged from the original Qt3, although still
sharing the same roots. With more changes planned ahead and with the
intention of better highlighting such difference, the TDE team has
decided to drop the ‘3’ from the repository name, which is now simply
called ‘TQt‘. ↫ TDE on Mastodon The effect this has on users is rather
minimal – users of the current 14.1.x release branch will still see 3s
around in file paths and package names, but in future 14.2.x releases,
all of these will have been removed, completing the transition. This
seems like a small change, and that’s because it is, but it’s
interesting simply because it highlights that a project that seems
relatively straightforward on the outside – maintain and carefully
modernise the final KDE 3.x release – encompasses a lot more than that.
Maintaining an entire Qt 3 fork certainly isn’t a small feat, but it’s
kind of required to keep a project like TDE going.</p>

<h2 id="vectorvfs-your-filesystem-as-a-vector-database">VectorVFS: your
filesystem as a vector database</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-06, from: OS News</p>
<p>VectorVFS is a lightweight Python package that transforms your Linux
filesystem into a vector database by leveraging the native VFS (Virtual
File System) extended attributes. Rather than maintaining a separate
index or external database, VectorVFS stores vector embeddings directly
alongside each file—turning your existing directory structure into an
efficient and semantically searchable embedding store. VectorVFS
supports Meta’s Perception Encoders (PE) which includes image/video
encoders for vision language understanding, it outperforms InternVL3,
Qwen2.5VL and SigLIP2 for zero-shot image tasks. We support both CPU and
GPU but if you have a large collection of images it might take a while
in the first time to embed all items if you are not using a GPU. ↫
Christian S. Perone It won’t surprise many of you that this goes a bit
above my paygrade, but according to my limited understanding, VectorVFS
stores information about files inside the xattr part of inodes. The
information being stored is converted into vectors first, and this is
the part that breaks my brain a bit, because vectors in this context are
far too complex for me to understand. I vaguely understand the end
result here – making files searchable using vector magic without using a
dedicated database or separate files by using extended attributes in
inodes – but the process is far more complicated to understand. It still
seems like a very interesting approach, though, and I’d love for people
smarter than me to take VectorVFS apart and explain it in easier terms
for those of us who don’t fully grasp it.</p>

<p>date: 2025-05-06, from: OS News</p>
<p>Can someone please stop these months from coming and going, because
I’m getting dizzy with yet another monthly report of all the progress
made by Redox. Aside from the usual swath of improvements to the kernel,
relibc, drivers, and so on, this month saw the completion of the
userspace process manager. In monolithic kernels this management is done
in the kernel, resulting in necessary ambient authority, and possibly
constrained interfaces if a stable ABI is to be guaranteed. With this
userspace implementation, it will be easier to manage access rights
using capabilities, reduce kernel bugs by keeping it simpler, and make
changes where both sides of the interface can be updated simultaneously.
↫ Ribbon and Ron Williams Students at Georgia Tech have been hard at
work this winter on Redox as well, building a system health monitoring
and recovery daemon and user interface. The Redox team has also done a
lot of work to improve the build infrastructure, fixing a number of
related issues along the way. The sudo daemon has now replaced the
setuid bit for improved user authentication security, and a ton of
existing ports have been fixed and updated where needed. Redox’ monthly
progress is kind of stunning, and it’s clear there’s a lot of
interesting in the Rust-based operating system from outside the project
itself as well. I wonder at what point Redox becomes usable for at least
some daily, end-user tasks. I think it’s not quite there yet, especially
when it comes to hardware support, but I feel like it’s getting there
faster than anyone anticipated.</p>

accidentally reveals Android’s Material 3 Expressive interface ahead of
I/O</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-06, from: OS News</p>
<p>Google’s accelerated Android release cycle will soon deliver a new
version of the software, and it might look quite different from what
you’d expect. Amid rumors of a major UI overhaul, Google seems to have
accidentally published a blog post detailing “Material 3 Expressive,”
which we expect to see revealed at I/O later this month. Google quickly
removed the post from its design site, but not before the Internet
Archive saved it. ↫ Ryan Whitwam at Ars Technica Google seems to be very
keen on letting us know this new redesign is based on a lot of user
research and metrics, which always sets off alarm bells in my mind when
it comes to user interfaces. Every single person uses their smartphone
and its applications a little differently, and using tons of metrics and
data to average all of this out can make it so that anyone who strays to
far from that average is going to have a bad time. This is compounded by
the fact that each and every one of us is going to stray form the
average in at least a few places. Google also seems to be throwing
consistency entirely out of the window with this redesign, which chills
me to the bone. One of the reasons I like the current iteration of
Material Design so much is that it does a great job of visually (and to
a less extent, behaviourally) unifying the operating system and the
applications you use, which I personally find incredibly valuable. I
very much prefer consistency over disparate branding, and the
screenshots and wording I’m seeing here seem to indicate Google
considers that a problem that needs fixing. As with everything UI,
screenshots don’t tell the whole story, so maybe it won’t be so bad. I
mean, it’s not like I’ve got anywhere else to go in case Google messes
this up. Monopolies (or duopolies) are fun.</p>

<p>date: 2025-05-06, from: OS News</p>
<p>Following the recent release of the IBM z17 mainframe, IBM today
unveiled the LinuxONE Emperor 5, which packs much of the same hardware
as the z17, but focused on Linux use. Today we’re announcing IBM
LinuxONE 5, performant Linux computing platform for data, applications
and your trusted AI, powered by the IBM Telum II processor with built-in
AI acceleration. This launch comes at a pivotal time, as technology
leaders focus on three critical imperatives: enabling security,
improving cost-efficiency, and integrating AI into enterprise systems. ↫
Marcel Mitran and Tina Tarquinio Yes, much like the z17, the LinuxONE 5
is a huge “AI” buzzword bonanza, but that’s to be expected in this day
and age. The LinuxONE 5, which, again, few of us will ever get to work
with, officially supports Red Hat, OpenSUSE, and Ubuntu, but a variety
of other Linux distributions offers support for IBM’s Z hardware, as
well.</p>

<h2 id="building-your-own-atomic-bootc-desktop">Building your own Atomic
(bootc) Desktop</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>Bootc and associated tools provide the basis for building a
personalised desktop. This article will describe the process to build
your own custom installation. ↫ Daniel Mendizabal at Fedora Magazine The
fact that atomic distributions make it relatively easy to create custom
“distributions” is s really interesting bonus quality of these types of
Linux distributions. The developers behind Blue95, which we talked about
a few weeks ago, based their entire distribution on this bootc
personalised desktop approach using Fedora, and they argue that the term
“distribution” probably isn’t the correct term here: Blue95 is a
collection of scripts and YAML files cobbled together to produce a
Containerfile, which is built via GitHub Actions and published to the
GitHub Container Registry. Which part of this process elevates the
project to the status of a Linux distribution? What set of RUN commands
in the Containerfile take the project from being merely a Fedora-based
OCI image to a full-blown Linux distribution? ↫ Adam Fidel While this
discussion is mostly academic, I still find it interesting how with the
march of technology, and with the aid of new ideas, it’s becoming easier
and easier to spin up a customised version of you favourite Linux
distribution, making it incredibly easy to have your own personal ISO,
with all your settings, themes, and customisations applied. This has
always been possible, but it seems to be getting easier. Atomic,
immutable distributions are not for me, personally, but I firmly believe
most distributions focusing on average, normal users – Ubuntu, Fedora,
SUSE – will eventually move their immutable variants to the prime spot
on their web sites. This will make a whole lot of people big mad, but I
think it’s inevitable. Of course, traditional Linux distributions won’t
be going away, but much like how people keep complaining about systemd
despite the tons alternatives, I’m guessing the same will happen with
immutable distributions.</p>

language Blueprint becomes part of GNOME</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>This week’s This Week in GNOME mentions that Blueprint will become
part of GNOME. Blueprint is now part of the GNOME Nightly SDK and is
expected to be part of the GNOME 49 SDK. This means, apps relying on
Blueprint won’t have to install it manually anymore. Blueprint is an
alternative to defining GTK/Libadwaita user interface via .ui XML-files
(GTK Builder files). The goal of blueprint is to provide UI definitions
that require less boilerplate than XML and are easier to learn.
Blueprint also provides a language server for IDE integration. ↫ Sophie
Herold Quite a few applications already make use of Blueprint, and even
some Core GNOME applications use it, so it seems logical to make it part
of the default GNOME installation.</p>
