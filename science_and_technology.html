<h2 id="the-flip-phone-web-browsing-with-the-original-opera-mini">The
flip phone web: browsing with the original Opera Mini</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-30, from: OS News</p>
<p>Opera Mini was first released in 2005 as a web browser for mobile
phones, with the ability to load full websites by sending most of the
work to an external server. It was a massive hit, but it started to fade
out of relevance once smartphones entered mainstream use. Opera Mini
still exists today as a web browser for iPhone and Android—it’s now just
a tweaked version of the regular Opera mobile browser, and you shouldn’t
use Opera browsers. However, the original Java ME-based version is still
functional, and you can even use it on modern computers. ↫ Corbin
Davenport I remember using Opera Mini back in the day on my PocketPC and
Palm devices. It wasn’t my main browser on those devices, but if some
site I really needed was acting up, Opera Mini could be a lifesaver, but
as we all remember, the mobile web before the arrival of the iPhone was
a trashfire. Interestingly enough, we circled back to the mobile web
being a trashfire, but at least we can block ads now to make it
bearable. Since Opera Mini is just a Java application, the client part
of the equation will probably remain executable for a long time, but
once Opera decides to close the server side of things, it will stop
being useful. Perhaps one day someone will reverse-engineer the protocol
and APIs, paving the way for a custom server we can all run as part of
the retrocomputing hobby. There’s always someone crazy and dedicated
enough.</p>

<p>The next Apple operating systems will be identified by year, rather
than with a version number, according to people with knowledge of the
matter. That means the current iOS 18 will give way to “iOS 26,” said
the people, who asked not to be identified because the plan is still
private. Other updates will be known as iPadOS 26, macOS 26, watchOS 26,
tvOS 26 and visionOS 26. Apple is making the change to bring consistency
to its branding and move away from an approach that can be confusing to
customers and developers. Today’s operating systems — including iOS 18,
watchOS 12, macOS 15 and visionOS 2 — use different numbers because
their initial versions didn’t debut at the same time. ↫ Mark Gurman at

in early Unix</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>If you use Unix today, you can enjoy relatively long file names on
more or less any filesystem that you care to name. But it wasn’t always
this way. Research V7 had 14-byte filenames, and the System III/System V
lineage continued this restriction until it merged with BSD Unix, which
had significantly increased this limit as part of moving to a new
filesystem (initially called the ‘Fast File System’, for good reasons).
You might wonder where this unusual number came from, and for that
matter, what the file name limit was on very early Unixes (it was 8
bytes, which surprised me; I vaguely assumed that it had been 14 from
the start). ↫ Chris Siebenmann I love these historical explanations for
seemingly arbitrary limitations.</p>

<h2
id="microsoft-unveils-microsofts-competitor-to-microsofts-winget">Microsoft
unveils Microsoft’s competitor to Microsoft’s winget</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>One of the ways in which Windows (and macOS) trails behind the Linux
and BSD world is the complete lack of centralised, standardised
application management. Windows users still have to scour the web to
download sketchy installers straight from the Windows 95 days, amassing
a veritable collection updaters in the process, which either
continuously run in the background, or annoy you with update pop-ups
when you launch an application. It’s an archaic nightmare users of
supposedly modern computers should not have to be dealing with.
Microsoft has tried to remedy this, but in true Microsoft fashion, it
did so halfheartedly, for instance with the Windows Package Manager,
better known as winget. Instead of building an actual package manager,
Microsoft basically just created a glorified script that downloads the
same installers you download manually, and runs them in unattended mode
in the background – it’s a download manager masquerading as a proper
application management framework. To complicate matters, winget is only
available as a command-line tool, meaning 99% of Windows users won’t be
using it. There’s no graphical frontend in Windows, and it’s not
integrated into Windows Update, so even if you strictly use winget to
install your applications – which will be hard, as there’s only about
1400 applications that use it – you still don’t have a centralised place
to upgrade your entire operating system and all of its applications.
It’s a mess, and Microsoft intends to address it. Again. This time,
they’re finally doing what should have been the goal from the start:
allowing applications to be updated through Windows Update. Built on the
Windows Update stack, the orchestration platform aims to provide
developers and product teams building apps and management tools with an
API for onboarding their update(s) that supports the needs of their
installers. The orchestrator will coordinate across all onboarded
products that are updated on Windows 11, in addition to Windows Update,
to provide IT admins and users with a consistent management plane and
experience, respectively. ↫ Angie Chen on the Windows IT Pro Blog Sounds
good, but hold on a minute – “orchestration platform”? So this isn’t the
existing winget, but integrated into Windows Update, where it should’ve
been all along? No, what we’re looking at here is Microsoft’s competitor
to Microsoft’s winget inside Microsoft’s Windows Update, oh and there’s
also the Windows Store. In other words, once this rolls out, it’ll be
yet another way to manage applications, existing inside Windows Update,
and alongside winget (and the Windows Store). They way it works is
surprisingly similar to winget: application developers can register an
update executable with the orchestrator, and the orchestrator will
periodically run this update executable to check for updates. In other
words, this looks a hell of a lot like a mere download manager for
existing updaters. What it’s definitively not, however, is winget – so
if you’re a Windows application developer, you now not only have to
register your application to work with winget, but also register it with
this new orchestrator to work with Windows Update. This thing is so
incredibly Microsoft.</p>

<h2 id="genode-os-framework-25.05-released">Genode OS Framework 25.05
released</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>It’s been 9 years since we disrupted Genode’s API. Back then, we
changed the execution model of components, consistently applied the
dependency-injection pattern to shun global side effects, and largely
removed C-isms like format strings and pointers. These changes
ultimately paved the ground for sophisticated systems like Sculpt OS.
Since then, we identified several potential areas for further safety
improvements, unlocked by the evolution of the C++ core language and
inspired by the popularization of sum types for error propagation by the
Rust community. With the current release, we uplift the framework API to
foster a programming style that leaves no possible error condition
unconsidered, reaching for a new level of rock-solidness of the
framework. Section The Great API hardening explains how we achieved
that. The revisited framework API comes in tandem with a new tool chain
based on GCC 14 and binutils 2.44. ↫ Genode OS Framework 25.05 release
notes This new release also brings a lot of progress on the integration
of the TCP/IP stacks ported from Linux and lwIP, improvements to the
Intel and VESA drivers, better power management of their Intel GPU
multiplexer, and more. They’ve also added support for touchscreen
gestures, file modification times support milliseconds now, and support
for the seL4 kernel has been improved. Many of these changes will find
their way into the next SculptOS release, or, in some cases, were
already added.</p>

OS in 46 bytes</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-27, from: OS News</p>
<p>An incredibly primitive operating system, with just two instructions:
compile (1) and execute (0). It is heavily inspired by Frank Sergeant
3-Instruction Forth and is a strip down exercise following up
SectorForth, SectorLisp, SectorC (the C compiler used here) and
milliForth. Here is the full OS code in 46 bytes of 8086 assembly
opcodes. ↫ 10biForthOS sourcehut page Yes, the entire operating system
easily fits right here, inside an OSNews quote block: 50b8 8e00 31d8
e8ff 0017 003c 0575 00ea5000 3c00 7401 eb02 e8ee 0005 0588 eb47b8e6 0200
d231 14cd e480 7580 c3f4 ↫ 10biForthOS sourcehut page How do you
actually use this operating system? Once the operating system is loaded
at boot, it listens on the serial port for instructions. You can then
send the instruction 1 followed by a byte of an assembly opcode which
will be compiled into a fixed location in memory. The instruction 0 will
then execute the program. There’s also a version with keyboard support,
as well as a much bigger version compiled for x86-64. Something like
this inevitably raises the question what an operating system really is,
and if this extremely limited and minimalist thing can be considered as
one. I’m not going to deep into this existential discussion, mostly
because I land firmly on the side that this is indeed just as much an
operating system as, say, Windows or MorphOS. This bit of code, when
booted, allows you to operate the system. It’s an operating system.</p>

<h2 id="signal-uses-windows-drm-to-counter-recall-snooping">Signal uses
Windows’ DRM to counter Recall snooping</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-27, from: OS News</p>
<p>Microsoft’s Recall feature, which takes screenshots of the contents
of your screen every few seconds, saves them, and then runs text and
image recognition to extract information from them, has had a rocky
start. Even now that it’s out there and Microsoft deems it ready for
everyone to use, it has huge security and privacy gaps, and one of them
is that applications that contain sensitive information, such as the
Windows Signal application, cannot ‘opt out’ of having their contents
scraped. Signal was rather unhappy with this massive privacy risk, and
decided to do something about it. It’s called screen security, and is
Windows-only because it’s specifically designed to counter Windows
Recall. If you attempt to take a screenshot of Signal Desktop when
screen security is enabled, nothing will appear. This limitation can be
frustrating, but it might look familiar to you if you’ve ever had the
audacity to try and take a screenshot of a movie or TV show on Windows.
According to Microsoft’s official developer documentation, setting the
correct Digital Rights Management (DRM) flag on the application window
will ensure that “content won’t show up in Recall or any other
screenshot application.” So that’s exactly what Signal Desktop is now
doing on Windows 11 by default. ↫ Joshua Lund on the Signal blog
Microsoft cares more about enforcing the rights of massive corporations
than it does about respecting the privacy of its users. As such,
everything is in place in Windows to ensure neither you nor Recall can
take screenshots of, I don’t know, the Bee Movie, but nothing has been
put in place to protect your private and sensitive messages in a service
like Signal. This really tells you all you need to know about who
Microsoft truly cares about, and it sure as hell isn’t you, the user.
What Signal is doing is absolutely brilliant. By turning Windows’
digital rights management features against Recall to protect the privacy
of Signal users, Signal has made it impossible – or at least very hard –
for Microsoft to address this. Of course, this also means that taking
screenshots of the Signal application on Windows for legitimate purposes
is more cumbersome now, but since you can temporarily turn screen
security off to take a screenshot means it’s not impossible. I almost
want other Windows developers to employ this same trick, just to make
Recall less valuable, but that’s probably not a great idea considering
how much it would annoy users just trying to take legitimate
screenshots. My uneducated guess is that this is exactly why Microsoft
isn’t providing developers with the kind of fine-grained controls to let
Recall know what it can and cannot take screenshots of: Microsoft must
know Recall is a feature for shareholders, not for users, and that users
will ask developers to opt-out of any Recall snooping if such APIs were
officially available. Microsoft wants to make it has hard as possible
for applications to opt out of being sucked into the privacy black hole
that is Recall, but in doing so, might be pushing developers to use DRM
to achieve the same goal. Just delicious. Signal also signed off with a
scathing indictment of “AI” as a whole. “Take a screenshot every few
seconds” legitimately sounds like a suggestion from a low-parameter LLM
that was given a prompt like “How do I add an arbitrary AI feature to my
operating system as quickly as possible in order to make investors
happy?” — but more sophisticated threats are on the horizon. The
integration of AI agents with pervasive permissions, questionable
security hygiene, and an insatiable hunger for data has the potential to
break the blood-brain barrier between applications and operating
systems. This poses a significant threat to Signal, and to every
privacy-preserving application in general. ↫ Joshua Lund on the Signal
blog Heed this warning.</p>
