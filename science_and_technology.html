<h2 id="valve-ends-steams-support-for-windows-7-and-8">Valve ends
Steam’s support for Windows 7 and 8</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-12, from: OS News</p>
<p>Steam has finally stopped working on several older Windows operating
systems, following a warning from Valve that it planned to drop support
earlier this year. With little fanfare, Windows 7 and Windows 8 gaming
on Steam is no longer possible following the most recent Steam client
update on November 5. ↫ Ben Stockton at PCGamesN It’s honestly wild that
Valve supported Windows 7 and 8 for this long for Steam in the first
place. They’ve been out of support for a long time, and at this point in
time, less than 0.3% of Steam users were using Windows 7 or 8. Investing
any resources in continuing to support them would be financially
irresponsible, while also aiding a tiny bit in allowing people to use
such unsupported, insecure systems to this day. I’m sure at least one of
you is still rocking Windows 7 or 8 as your daily driver operating
system, so I’m sorry if you don’t want to hear this, but it’s really,
really time to move on. Buying a Windows 10 or 11 license on eBay or
whatever costs a few euros at most – if you’re not eligible for one the
free upgrade programs Microsoft ran – and especially Windows 10 should
run just fine on pretty much anything Windows 7 or 8 runs on. Do note
that with Windows 10, though, you’ll be back in the same boat next
year.</p>
