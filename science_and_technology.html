      <h1>macOS made to run on iPhone</h1>

(date: 2025-08-15, from: OS News)
      <p>
      We removed ads from OSNews. Donate to our fundraiser to ensure our future! What if you could run the full macOS on your iPhone or iPad? Quite a few people have made the case to run macOS especially on the latter, and it seems this isn&#8217;t as much of an unobtainable pipe dream as you might think. Duy Tran has been working on getting macOS to run on jailbroken iPhones and iPads, and it seems he&#8217;s making some headway. Eventually, I managed to boot somewhat macOS 13.4 natively on my iPhone XS Max on iOS 16.5; keyboard &#38; mouse input is currently done via VNC. After some manual patching, many apps and daemons running (WindowServer, ControlCenter, Dock, and even Xcode 15b8). ↫ Duy Tran on Reddit It should go without saying this is incredibly limited so far, and there&#8217;s immense amounts of work required to bring this to a point where anyone could use this in any serious manner. Still, it&#8217;s very impressive so far, and it shows beyond the shadow of a doubt that macOS can, indeed, run on iPads if Apple wanted it to. This initial code is on GitHub, but it&#8217;s definitely not for the faint of heart.

      <h1>“AI” is the endgame for totalitarians</h1>

(date: 2025-08-15, from: OS News)
      <p>
      We removed ads from OSNews. Donate to our fundraiser to ensure our future! An internal Meta Platforms document detailing policies on chatbot behavior has permitted&#160;the company’s artificial intelligence&#160;creations to “engage a child in conversations that are romantic or sensual,” generate false medical information and help users argue that Black people are “dumber than white people.” These and other findings emerge from a Reuters review of the Meta document, which discusses the standards that guide its generative AI assistant,&#160;Meta AI, and chatbots available on Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, the company’s social-media platforms. ↫ Jeff Horwitz at Reuters The only way one can describe the examples of allowed behaviour towards minors is absolutely fucked up. If I&#8217;d find any person talking to my kids like Facebook and Zuckerberg apparently think it&#8217;s okay to talk to children, I&#8217;d be calling the police to file a report. I know I shouldn&#8217;t be surprised considering it&#8217;s Facebook and Zuckerberg, a company with a history of knowingly inciting violence and genocide and a founder who created his website to creep on women, but the lows to which this company and its founder are willing to go are just so unimaginable to even people with just a modicum of morality, I just can&#8217;t wrap my brain around it. The treatment of people of colour isn&#8217;t any better. Facebook will happily argue for you that black people are dumber than white people without so much as batting an eye. Again, none of this should be surprising considering it&#8217;s Facebook, but add to it the fact that &#8220;AI&#8221; is the endgame for totalitarians, and it all makes even more sense. These tools are explicitly designed to generate totalitarian propaganda, because they&#8217;re trained on totalitarian propaganda, i.e., most of the internet. The examples of &#8220;AI&#8221; being fascist and racist are legion, and considering the people creating them &#8211; Zuckerberg, Altman, Musk, and so on &#8211; all have clear fascist and totalitarian tendencies or simply are overtly fascist, we, again, shouldn&#8217;t be surprised. Totalitarians hate artists and intellectuals, because artists and intellectuals are the ones who tend to not fall for their bullshit. That&#8217;s why one of the first steps taken by any totalitarian regime is curtailing the arts and sciences, from Pol Pot to Mao, from Trump to Orban. Promoting &#8220;AI&#8221; as a replacement for exactly these groups in society &#8211; &#8220;AI&#8221; generating &#8220;art&#8221; to replace artists, &#8220;AI&#8221; doing &#8220;research&#8221; to replace actual scientists &#8211; fits within the totalitarian playbook like a perfectly fitted glove. When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time. This apparently also applies to &#8220;AI&#8221;.

      <h1>NASA Seeks Proposals for 2026 Human Exploration Rover Challenge</h1>

(date: 2025-08-15, from: NASA breaking news)
      <p>
      NASA now is accepting proposals from student teams for a contest to design, build, and test rovers for Moon and Mars exploration through Sept. 15. Known as the Human Exploration Rover Challenge, student rovers should be capable of traversing a course while completing mission tasks.&#160;The&#160;challenge handbook&#160;has guidelines for remote-controlled&#160;and human-powered divisions. “Last year, we saw [&#8230;]

      <h1>Open hardware desktop 3D printing is dead – you just don’t know it yet</h1>

(date: 2025-08-15, from: OS News)
      <p>
      We removed ads from OSNews. Donate to our fundraiser to ensure our future! Hi, FAB 2025 is still happening in Prague and it has been a wonderful event. It’s been great to meet so many people from our community at home, in Czechia! But during my chats with the attendee’s, there was one topic which was emerging time and time again, and that is the state of open hardware. I cannot talk about all of the open hardware, but I can share experience from 3D printing. And it is not good! Open hardware in 3D printing is dead &#8211; you just don’t know it yet. This is an opinion piece, imagine we are talking about this topic over a cold Pilsner&#8230; ↫ Josef Prusa What happens when the Chinese government lists 3D printing as an industry it wants to dominate? Well, an explosion in bogus patents and the death of tons of smaller, local brands, leaving only major players from China and perhaps one or two bigger non-Chinese brands. That&#8217;s the conclusion by Josef Prusa, founder of Prusa Research, a major 3D printer maker from Prague, Czechia. Prusa&#8217;s printers used to be entirely open source, but starting in 2023, this is no longer the case &#8211; ostensibly because being open source hardware meant that competitors were copying their work wholesale without contributing anything back, or worse, stealing their work entirely and keeping it all closed, despite the copyleft license in use. Looking at the numbers, it seems clear that smaller companies will not be able to deal with the onslaught of bogus patents, as fighting patent infringement claims in court and getting patents invalidated, even if prior art exists in abundance, is prohibitively expensive and incredibly time-consuming. It&#8217;s a game of really expensive whack-a-mole against people with far deeper pockets than you. Still, this whole thing does taste a bit sour considering Prusa&#8217;s abandonment of its open source roots and ideals. There&#8217;s a business to be run here, I understand that, but principles do matter, and if not even a company priding itself on producing open source hardware stands by its ideals, why should anyone else?

      We removed ads from OSNews. Donate to our fundraiser to ensure our future! We all managed to survive another month, so here we are, with another monthly update from Haiku, covering the month of July. It&#8217;s been a rather short month, it being the middle of Summer and all, but there&#8217;s still some significant stuff in here. For instance, a whole slew of fixes arrived for su and other multiuser commands, mostly for the benefit of SSH sessions. A central theme in July seems to have been filesystems, as FAT16 was added to the known filesystem types in the Storage Kit, quite a few fixes were implemented for NFSv4, and a number of filesystems saw bugfixes to fix issues in rsync, and much more. Another central theme is apparently a port of DOSEMU, for which a number of bugfixes, changes, and improvements were implemented that could, in turn, also benefit other possible ports. And of course, there&#8217;s much, much more that happened, for which you&#8217;ll have to dive into the full progress report.

      <p>
      We removed ads from OSNews. Donate to our fundraiser to ensure our future! We&#8217;re not done with the AROS news quite yet, as Andrzej Subocz published another update with the latest news from the AROS community. Some of it we already covered, but a lot it we haven&#8217;t. For instance, there&#8217;s the initial version of a partitioning tool for AROS, called QuickPart. For now, it&#8217;s in read-only mode, but once it&#8217;s complete, it will allow users to do, well, partitioning. Work has also begun on porting SDL2 to AROS, replacing the aging SDL 1.2 version currently available. On top of all that, there&#8217;s a lot of work on new and improved network drivers for the 64bit version, an extensive amount of changes and improvements to the build system, C library, datatypes, and much more. Subocz&#8217; full report has many more details, so head on over and read up.

      <h1>AmiBrowser: the Chromium engine running on a Linux host talking to a 68K Amiga application running inside a 68K emulator</h1>

(date: 2025-08-14, from: OS News)
      <p>
      We removed ads from OSNews. Donate to our fundraiser to ensure our future! Covering the Amiga world is always a bit of a crapshoot, since for what is surely an incredibly small segment of the computing world, it happens to be incredibly complex, with multiple competing Amiga-ish operating systems and hardware platforms, all worsened by many empty promises and bitter animosity flying every which way. This makes it hard for an outsider to get a firm grasp on what&#8217;s going on, but as always, I&#8217;ll try my best. The news here is that AmiKit has released a new browser for the classic 68k Amiga that can load modern websites. The browser is called AmiBrowser. AmiBrowser is an HTML 5 capable web browser built for 68K with Zune/MUI. Ituses ARM libraries to power the native rendering of the web pages. ↫ AmiKit press release AmiBrowser is exclusive to AmiKit&#8217;s own Amiga-like hardware, the A600 GS and A1200 NG, both of which are replacement boards for the original Amiga 600 and 1200, respectively. How do these machines work? Well, they come in the shape of their original counterparts, but with far fewer chips, and one crucial addition: a little Orange Pi Zero 3 (in the case of the A1200 NG, at least) daughterboard that contains the actual ARM SoC that powers the machine. The way this setup works is that the Orange Pi Zero 3 boots into a minimal Linux environment with a launcher-like interface, which can in turn load up the Amiberry classic 68K Amiga emulator that can communicate with its ARM Linux host. It&#8217;s inside this 68K emulator where the actual operating system runs. This Amiga-like operating system is called AmiBench, which is, very simply put, a modified variant of the 68K version of AROS, combined with libraries and components that can make use of the ARM processor. And so we finally arrive at this new browser. This new browser runs the Chromium Embedded Framework in the host Linux environment on the ARM processor, forwarding its rendering towards a native 68K Amiga/AROS application that&#8217;s running inside the 68K emulator. In between the CEF running on the Linux host and the native Amiga 68K application running inside the emulator sits a glue layer that takes care of the communication between the two sides. It&#8217;s an interesting approach to a very difficult problem: how do you run a modern browser on a hardware platform &#8211; 68K, in this case &#8211; that is horribly outdated and far too slow to deal with modern websites? It&#8217;s an interesting approach, but it also feels a little bit like a house of cards. That being said, if the choice is between no access to the modern web and shaky access to the modern web, I&#8217;d still choose the latter.

      <h1>Debian GNU/Hurd 2025 released with Rust, 64bit support, and more</h1>

(date: 2025-08-13, from: OS News)
      <p>
      We removed ads from OSNews. Donate to our fundraiser to ensure our future! The Hurd, the collection of services that run atop the GNU Mach microkernel, has been in development for a very, very long time. The Hurd is intended to serve as the kernel for the GNU Project, but with the advent of Linux and its rapid rise in popularity, it&#8217;s the Linux kernel that became the defacto kernel for the GNU Project, a combination we&#8217;re supposed to refer to as GNU/Linux. Unless you run Alpine, of course. Or you run any other modern Linux distribution, which probably contains more non-GNU code than it does GNU code, but I digress. The Hurd is still in development, however, and one of the more common ways to use The Hurd is by installing Debian GNU/Hurd, which combines the Debian package repositories with The Hurd. Debian GNU/Hurd 2025 was released yesterday, and brings quite a few large improvements and additions. This is a snapshot of Debian &#8220;sid&#8221; at the time of the stable Debian &#8220;Trixie&#8221; release (August 2025), so it is mostly based on the same sources. It is not an official Debian release, but it is an official Debian GNU/Hurd port release. ↫ Samuel Thibault About 72% of the Debian archive is available for Debian GNU/Hurd, for both i386 and amd64. This indeed means 64bit support is now available, which makes use of the userland disk drivers from NetBSD. Support for USB disks and CD-ROM was added, and the console now uses xkb for keyboard layout support. Bigger-ticket items are working SMP support and a port of the Rust programming language. Of course, there&#8217;s a ton more changes, fixes, improvements, and additions as well. You can either install Debian GNU/Hurd using the Debian installer, or download a pre-installed disk image for use with, say, qemu.

      <h1>OSNews goes ad-free, for everyone, and we need your support</h1>

(date: 2025-08-12, from: OS News)
      <p>
      Earlier today, I made the decision to remove all advertising from OSNews. From here on out, you will no longer see any ads, cookie banners, and other ad-related privacy-invasive technologies on this website. While this means a hit to my income, making OSNews even more reliant on our Patreon supporters and Ko-Fi donors, it genuinely feels liberating. I should&#8217;ve made this decision years ago. Read on for how you can support us, and our big fundraiser. I have always been open and honest about my dislike for the modern online advertising industry. It&#8217;s incredibly privacy-invasive, a massive security risk, generally lacking in taste, and genuinely intrusive. As such, despite running ads on OSNews, I have always advocated for the concept of &#8220;your computer, your rules&#8221;, meaning only you, the user, gets to decide what gets run on your computer and displayed on your screen. This includes the use of ad-blockers. I have a Pi-Hole, and you can pry it from my cold, dead hands. Because of this, maintaining ads on OSNews became untenable. Everything about the ads on our site, from the actual ads themselves to the annoying cookie banners talking about &#8220;our 1500 partners&#8221;, gave me the ick, as the young, hip people say, and I&#8217;ve been considering turning them off for a long time. Today, after yet another reader rightfully pointing out how absurd our cookie banner was, I finally made the call. One email to our owner, David Adams, later, and we&#8217;re now entirely ad-free, for everyone. This is a hit to my income, and as such, I kindly ask anyone capable of doing so to support the continued existence of OSNews. How can you support OSNews? We&#8217;ve been online since 1997, meaning soon we&#8217;ll be hitting our 30-year anniversary. Very few websites can boast about such a long, uninterrupted existence, and despite all the changes both the industry and the world at large have gone through, OSNews is still here, doing what it has always done. The removal of ads means we&#8217;re even more dependent on you, dear readers, but I&#8217;m confident in saying that we&#8217;ll make it another 30 years. Thank you for all your continued support over the decades, and let&#8217;s keep going. Without icky ads.

      Astronaut Captures Rare Gigantic Jet from Space On July 3, 2025, NASA astronaut Nichole Ayers photographed an extraordinary sight from the International Space Station — a rare gigantic jet, a powerful electrical discharge shooting from the top of a thunderstorm into the upper atmosphere. Often mistaken for sprites, these towering lightning events bridge clouds and space, depositing massive electrical charges. Learn how gigantic jets differ from other Transient Luminous Events and how you can submit your own sightings to Spritacular.org.

      <h1>KWin gets Liquid Glass effects “Only Apple” can make</h1>

(date: 2025-08-12, from: OS News)
      <p>
      Apple, back in June of this year: This is our broadest software design update ever. Meticulously crafted by rethinking the fundamental elements that make up our software, the new design features an entirely new material called Liquid Glass. It combines the optical qualities of glass with a fluidity only Apple can achieve, as it transforms depending on your content or context. ↫ Apple&#8217;s WWDC press release Today, iGerman00, detailing their merge request for adding Liquid Glass effects to a KWin plugin: Added a Concave (lens) refraction mode for a more “Liquid Glass” look, it&#8217;s a lot closer than the current implementation. Also added a Refraction Corner Radius slider (0–200px, 30 steps) to shape the SDF independently of edge size. Because the concave implementation is a bit &#8220;weaker&#8221;, I&#8217;ve raised the maxima to 30 for the relevant sliders. Added some UI logic for irrelevant options between modes. ↫ iGerman00&#8217;s merge request One of the world&#8217;s wealthiest companies, outdone by a random &#8220;amateur hobbyist developer&#8220;. Not only does this merge request recreate Apple&#8217;s Liquid Glass effects, it does so with a detailed settings panel to control every aspect of the effect, something Apple obviously won&#8217;t allow you to do. &#8220;Only Apple&#8221; my ass.

      <h1>Firefox’ new “AI” features cause  CPU spikes and battery drain</h1>

(date: 2025-08-12, from: OS News)
      <p>
      Almost three weeks ago, Mozilla released Firefox 141 that, among other features like memory optimizations for Linux and a built-in unit converter, brought controversial AI-enhanced tab groups. Powered by a local AI model, these groups identify related tabs and suggest names for them. There is even a &#8220;Suggest more tabs for group&#8221; button that users can click to get recommendations. Now, several users have taken to the Firefox subreddit to complain about high CPU usage when using the feature, as well as express their disappointment in Mozilla for adding AI to the browser. ↫ David Uzondu at NeoWin Is anybody even asking for &#8220;AI&#8221; features in Firefox? Of the six people still left using Firefox, does even one of them want a chatbot in Firefox? Is any Firefox user the type of user to use some nebulous &#8220;AI&#8221; tool to organize their open tabs? Seeing these kinds of frivolities in Chrome or Edge or whatever makes sense, but in Firefox? At least they&#8217;re easy to disable through about:config &#8211; just set both browser.ml.chat.enabled and browser.tabs.groups.smart.enabled to false. I mean, I guess I can understand Mozilla trying to ride the hype bubble, but at least make this nonsense opt-in, instead of asking users to dig around in obtuse config flags.

      <h1>KDE improves focus stealing prevention on Wayland</h1>

(date: 2025-08-11, from: OS News)
      <p>
      You click a link in your chat app, your browser with a hundred tabs comes to the front and opens that page. How hard can it be? Well, you probably know by now that Wayland, unlike X, doesn’t let one application force its idiot wishes on everyone else. In order for an application to bring its window to the front, it needs to make use of the XDG Activation protocol. In essence, an application cannot take focus, it can only receive focus. In the example above, your chat app would request an XDG Activation token from the compositor. It then asks the system to open the given URL (typically launching the web browser) and sends along the token. The browser can then use this token to activate its window. ↫ Kai Uwe After explaining exactly how this mechanism works, KDE developer Kai Uwe details the issue that not every application yet properly supports the XDG Activation protocol, and some that do have bugs that, say, might make an application discard its token too early. In other words, it&#8217;s time to start testing. You&#8217;ll need to use the latest git master brach of KWin, and enable set the &#8220;Focus Stealing Prevention&#8221; option in Window Management to &#8220;Extreme&#8221;. When set to &#8220;Extreme&#8221;, KWin will exclusively activate windows that request activation with a valid token. They&#8217;ve already found and fixed a number of issues in KDE using this method, but more are bound to found, particularly in third-party applications. They&#8217;re planning on turning on KWin&#8217;s focus stealing prevention on Wayland with forgiving settings at first, but increase the strictness of the feature as time progresses and issues are fixed.

      <h1>GitHub becomes part of Microsoft’s “AI” organisation</h1>

(date: 2025-08-11, from: OS News)
      <p>
      It seems Microsoft is absorbing GitHub deeper into Microsoft. GitHub’s CEO Thomas Dohmke is stepping down, and GitHub will be integrated into a new department within Microsoft. Which department will become the new stewards of GitHub, and the massive pile of open source code it’s hosting? You already know. Still, after all this time, my startup roots have begun tugging on me and I’ve decided to leave GitHub to become a founder again. GitHub and its leadership team will continue its mission as part of Microsoft’s CoreAI organization, with more details shared soon. I’ll be staying through the end of 2025 to help guide the transition and am leaving with a deep sense of pride in everything we’ve built as a remote-first organization spread around the world. ↫ Thomas Dohmke GitHub will become part of a new “AI” engineering group inside Microsoft, led by a former Facebook executive, Jay Parikh. As The Verge notes, this new group includes platform and development tools and Dev Div teams, “with a focus on building an AI platform and tools for both Microsoft and its customers”. In other words, Microsoft is going to streamline taking your code and sucking it up into its “AI” slop machines. If you’re hosting code on GitHub, the best time to move it somewhere else was yesterday, but if you haven’t yet, the second best time is today. Unless you want your code to be sucked up into Microsoft and regurgitated to sloppify Windows and Office, you should be moving your code to GitHub alternatives.

      <h1>DisplayPort is better than HDMI, and I will die on this hill</h1>

(date: 2025-08-11, from: OS News)
      <p>
      Over the years, we’ve seen a good number of interfaces used for computer monitors, TVs, LCD panels and other all-things-display purposes. We’ve lived through VGA and the large variety of analog interfaces that preceded it, then DVI, HDMI, and at some point, we’ve started getting devices with DisplayPort support. So you might think it’s more of the same. However, I’d like to tell you that you probably should pay more attention to DisplayPort – it’s an interface powerful in a way that we haven’t seen before. ↫ Arya Voronova at HackADay DisplayPort is a better user experience in every way compared to HDMI. I am so, so sad that HDMI has won out in the consumer electronics space, with all of its countless anti-user features as detailed in the linked article. I refuse to use HDMI when DisplayPort is available, so all of my computers&#8217; displays are hooked up over DP. Whenever I did try to use HDMI, I always ran into issues with resolution, refresh rates, improper monitor detection, and go knows what else. Plug in a DP cable, and everything always just works. Sadly, in consumer electronics, DisplayPort isn&#8217;t all that common. Game consoles, Hi-Fi audio, televisions, and so on, all push HDMI hard and often don&#8217;t offer a DisplayPort option at all. It takes me back to the early-to-late 2000s, when my entire audio setup was hooked up using optical cables, simply because I was a MiniDisc user and had accepted the gospel of optical cables. Back then, too, I refused to buy or use anything that used unwieldy analog cables. Mind you, this had nothing to do with audio quality &#8211; it was a usability thing. If anyone is aware of home audio devices and televisions that do offer DisplayPort, feel free to jump into the comments.

      <h1>Zig’s lovely syntax</h1>

(date: 2025-08-11, from: OS News)
      <p>
      It’s a bit of a silly post, because syntax is the least interesting d detail about the language, but, still, I can’t stop thinking how Zig gets this detail just right for the class of curly-braced languages, and, well, now you’ll have to think about that too. On the first glance, Zig looks almost exactly like Rust, because Zig borrows from Rust liberally. And I think that Rust has great syntax, considering all the semantics it needs to express (see “Rust’s Ugly Syntax”). But Zig improves on that, mostly by leveraging simpler language semantics, but also through some purely syntactical tasteful decisions. ↫ Alex Kladov Y&#8217;all know full well I know very little about programming, so there&#8217;s much interesting stuff I can add here. The only slightly related frame of reference I have is how some languages &#8211; as in, the ones we speak &#8211; have a pleasing grammar or spelling, and how even when you can&#8217;t actually speak a language, some of them intrinsically look attractive and pleasing when you see them in written form. I mean, you can&#8217;t look at Scottisch Gaelic and not notice it just looks pleasing: Dh’ éirich mi moch air mhaduinn an-dé‘S gun ghearr mi’n ear-thalmhainn do bhrìgh mo sgéilAn dùil gu ‘m faicinn fhéin rùn mo chléibhOch òin gu ‘m faca ‘s a cùl rium féin. ↫ Mo Shùil Ad Dhèidh by Donald MacNicol I have no idea if programmers can look at programming languages the same way, but I&#8217;ve often been told there&#8217;s more overlap between programming languages and regular language than many people think. As such, it wouldn&#8217;t surprise me if some programming languages look really pleasing to programmers, even if they can&#8217;t use them because they haven&#8217;t really learned them yet.
