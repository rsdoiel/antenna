UEFI force-installs and reinstalls shovelware on Windows and it’s
spamming users with Christmas wishes</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-26, from: OS News</p>
<p>I didn’t have the time to post this one before Christmas, but it’s so
funny and sad at the same time I don’t want to keep this from you. It
turns out that in the days leading up to Christmas this year, users of
ASUS computers – or with ASUS motherboards, I guess – were greeted with
a black bar covering about a third of their screen, decorated with a
Christmas wreath. I am making this post for the sake of people like me
who will have a black box show up at the bottom of their screen with a
Christmas wreath labeled “christmas.exe” in task manager and think it’s
Windows 10/11 malware. It is not. It is from the ASUS Armoury Crate
program and can be safely closed and ignored. It looks super sketchy and
will hopefully save you some time diagnosing the problem. ↫
Slow-Macaroon9630 on reddit So yes, if you’re using an ASUS computer and
have their shovelware installed, you may have been greeted by a giant
black banner caused by an executable called “christmas.exe”, which
sounds exactly like something shitty malware would do. The banner would
disappear after a while, and the executable would vanish from the list
of running processes as well. It turns out there’s a similar seasonal
greeting called “HappyNewYear.exe”, so if you haven’t done anything to
address the first black bar, you might be getting a second one soon. The
fact that shitty OEM shovelware does this kind of garbage on Windows is
nothing new – class is not something you can accuse Windows of having –
but I was surprised to find out just how deeply embedded this ASUS
shovelware program called Armoury Crate really is. It doesn’t just come
preinstalled on ASUS computers – no, this garbage program actually has
roots in your motherboard’s firmware. If you merely uninstall Amoury
Crate from Windows, it will automatically reinstall itself because your
motherboard’s firmware tells it to. I’m not joking. To prevent Armory
Crate from reinstalling itself, you have to reboot your PC into its
UEFI, go to the Advanced Mode, go to Tool &gt; ASUS Armoury Crate, and
disable the option Download &amp; Install ARMOURY CRATE app. I had no
idea Windows hardware makers had sunk to this kind of low, but I’m also
not surprised. If Microsoft shoves endless amounts of ads and shovelware
on people’s computers, why can’t OEMs?</p>

<h2 id="cobolcraft-a-minecraft-server-written-in-cobol">CobolCraft: a
Minecraft server written in COBOL</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-26, from: OS News</p>
<p>COBOL, your mother’s and grandmother’s programming language, is still
in relatively wide use today, and with the initial batches of COBOL
programmers retiring and, well, going away, there’s a market out there
for younger people to learn COBOL and gain some serious job security in
stable, but perhaps boring market segments. One of the things you would
not associate with COBOL, however, is gaming – but it turns out it can
be used for that, too. CobolCraft is a Minecraft server written in, you
guessed it, COBOL. It was developed using GnuCOBOL, and only works on
Linux – Windows and macOS are not supported, but it can be run using
Electron for developers, otherwise known as Docker. It’s only compatible
with the latest release of Minecraft at the time of CobolCraft’s
development, version 1.21.4, and a few more complex blocks with states
are not yet supported because of how difficult it is to program those
using COBOL. CobolCraft’s creator, Fabian Meyer, explains why he started
this project: Well, there are quite a lot of rumors and stigma
surrounding COBOL. This intrigued me to find out more about this
language, which is best done with some sort of project, in my opinion.
You heard right – I had no prior COBOL experience going into this.
Writing a Minecraft server was perhaps not the best idea for a first
COBOL project, since COBOL is intended for business applications, not
low-level data manipulation (bits and bytes) which the Minecraft
protocol needs lots of. However, quitting before having a working
prototype was not on the table! A lot of this functionality had to be
implemented completely from scratch, but with some clever programming,
data encoding and decoding is not just fully working, but also quite
performant. ↫ Fabian Meyer I don’t know much about programming, but I do
grasp that this is a pretty crazy thing to do, and quite the achievement
to get working this well, too. Do note that this isn’t a complete
implementation of the Minecraft server, with certain more complex blocks
not working, and things like a lighting engine not being made yet
either. This doesn’t detract from the achievement, but it does mean you
won’t be playing regular Minecraft with this for a while yet – if ever,
if this remains a fun hobby project for its creator.</p>

Moxie child support robot gets new lease on life through open
source</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-24, from: OS News</p>
<p>It’s a Christmas miracle! The Moxie, that support robot thing for
kids we talked about two weeks ago, seems to be getting a new lease on
life. The start-up that makes the Moxie has announced it’s going to not
only release a version of the server software for self-hosting, but will
also publish all of the source code as open source. We understand how
unsettling and disappointing it has been to face the possibility of
losing the daily comfort and support Moxie provides. Since the onset of
these recent challenges, many of you have voiced heartfelt concerns and
offered suggestions, and we have taken that feedback seriously. While
our cloud services may become unavailable, a group of former technical
team members from Embodied is working on a potential solution to allow
Moxie to operate locally—without the need for ongoing cloud
connectivity. This initiative involves developing a local server
application (“OpenMoxie”) that you can run on your own computer. Once
available, this community-driven option will enable you (or technically
inclined individuals) to maintain Moxie’s basic functionality, develop
new features, and modify her capabilities to better suit your
needs—without reliance on Embodied’s cloud servers. ↫ Paolo Pirjanian
Having products like this be dependent on internet connectivity is not
great, but as long as Silicon Valley is the way it is, that’s not going
to change. You can tell from their efforts that the people at Embodied
do genuinely care about their product and the people that use it,
because they have zero – absolutely zero – financial incentive or legal
obligation to do any of this. They could’ve just walked away like their
original communication said they were going to, but instead they
listened to their customers and changed their minds. Regardless of my
thoughts on requiring internet connectivity for something like this,
they at least did the right thing today – and I commend them for
that.</p>
