id="this-sculpt-os-video-walkthrough-explains-how-to-use-sculpt-os">This
Sculpt OS video walkthrough explains how to use Sculpt OS</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-31, from: OS News</p>
<p>We talk about the Genode project and Sculpt OS quite regularly on
OSNews, but every time I’ve tried using Sculpt OS, I’ve always found it
so different and so unique compared to everything else that I just
couldn’t wrap my head around it. I assume this stems from nothing but my
own shortcomings, because the Genode project often hammers on the fact
that Sculpt OS is in daily-driver use by a lot of people within and
without the project, so there must be something here just not clicking
for me. Well, it seems I’m actually not the only one with difficulties
getting started with Sculpt OS’ unique structure and interface, because
Norman Feske, co-founder of Genode Labs, has published a lengthy,
detailed, but very interesting and easy to follow screencast explaining
exactly how to use Sculpt OS and its unique features and
characteristics. Even though Sculpt OS has been in routine daily use for
years now, many outside observers still tend to perceive it as fairly
obscure because it does not follow the usual preconceptions of a
consumer-oriented operating system. Extensive documentation exists, but
it leaves a fairly technical impression at a cursory glance, which may
scare some people away. The screencast below aims at making the system a
little bit more approachable. It walks you through the steps of
downloading, installing, booting the system image, navigating the
administrative user interface, and interactively extending and
customizing the system. The tour is wrapped up with the steps for
creating your personal sculpted OS on a bootable USB stick. ↫ Norman
Feske After watching this, I genuinely feel I have much better grasp of
how to use Sculpt OS and just how powerful it really is, and that it’s
really not as difficult to use as it may look at first glance. The next
time I set some time aside for Sculpt OS, I feel I’ll have a much better
grasp of what to do and how to use it properly.</p>

<h2 id="building-a-t1d-smartwatch-from-scratch">Building a (T1D)
smartwatch from scratch</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-31, from: OS News</p>
<p>If you have type 1 diabetes, you need to keep track of and manage
your blood glucose levels closely, as if these levels dip too low, it
can quickly spiral into a medical emergency. Andrew Childs’ 9 year old
son has type 1 diabetes, and Childs was unhappy with any of the current
offerings on the market for children to keep track of their blood
glucose levels. Most people suggested an Apple Watch, but he found the
Apple Watch “too much device” for a kid, something I personally agree
with. It ships with so many shiny features and apps and notifications.
It’s beautifully crafted. It’s also way too distracting for a kid while
they’re at school. Secondly, it doesn’t provide a good, reliable view of
his CGM data. The Dexcom integration is often backgrounded, doesn’t show
the chart, only the number and an arrow. People use hacks like creating
calendar events just to see up-to-date data. And the iOS settings,
Screen Time, and notification systems have ballooned into a giant ball
of complexity. What we need is something simple. ↫ Andrew Childs And so
Childs set out to design and prototype a smartwatch just for his son to
wear, trying to address the shortcomings of other offerings on the
market along the way, and possibly even bring it to market for other
people in similar situations. After six months, he managed to create
several prototypes, with both the software and hardware designed from
the ground up, that he and his son still wear to this day, to great
satisfaction. Since Childs didn’t really know where to go from there and
how to turn what he had into an actual product people could be, he
decided to document his effort online. In the process, he had to
overcome a ton of hurdles, from iOS’ strict BLE limitations,
difficult-to-reach soldering points that can’t be moved due to the small
size of the PCB, optimising the battery life, dealing with glass
manufacturing, and many other issues, big and small. Oh and also, he was
a software engineer, not a hardware one, so he had to learn a lot of new
skills, from working with 3D modeling to PCB design. In the end, though,
he’s now got a few devices that look quite professionally made, that are
incredibly easy to repair, and that are focused solely on those things
he and his son need. This project has increased the quality of life for
his son, and that’s genuinely all that really matters here.</p>

Together they could enable even more significant advances; however, combining these disciplines to enable precise and scalable interactions between molecules and microsystems has remained a significant challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this challenge, DARPA announced the &lt;a href=&quot;https://drupal.darpa.mil/research/programs/microsystem-induced&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microsystem Induced CAtalysis (MICA) program&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. MICA seeks to develop new approaches for integrating molecular catalysts with microsystems, using physical forces generated by the microsystem to influence catalytic activity. A key technical focus of MICA is enabling reaction cascades: sequences of molecular reactions that rely on multiple catalysts working together, much like a relay race where each runner (catalyst) hands off the baton (reactants) smoothly to the next. To succeed, each runner must be precisely positioned, securely anchored in their lane, and adaptable to changing track conditions—just as MICA requires precise placement and robust attachment of catalysts to microsystems, along with adaptive interfaces that can maintain performance under varying conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MICA researchers will also create advanced modeling and simulation tools to predict how these integrated systems perform under dynamic conditions, enabling unprecedented design accuracy. Proposals from interested organizations are due March 20, 2025, at 1 p.m. ET. A target start date of Aug. 1, 2025, may be assumed for planning purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The potential to harness microsystems to enhance the precision and efficiency of molecular catalysts represents a paradigm shift in how we approach biological function and chemical synthesis,” said Dr. Todd Bauer, MICA program manager in DARPA’s Microsystems Technology Office. “MICA is designed to bring together molecular and microsystem engineering in ways that were previously unfeasible, paving the way for new advances in material synthesis, medical therapies, biothreat detection, and beyond.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MICA is planned as a two-phase, 39-month program, and will include an ethical, legal, and societal implications plan that includes ongoing discussions regarding potential impacts of the technology following its development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information, visit the &lt;a href=&quot;https://drupal.darpa.mil/research/programs/microsystem-induced&quot;&gt;MICA program page&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://sam.gov/opp/42da1182aca24582863d91afacd9d8f9/view&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Broad Agency Announcement&lt;/a&gt; on SAM.gov.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-center&quot;&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-center&quot;&gt;Media with inquiries should contact DARPA Public Affairs at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:outreach@darpa.mil&quot;&gt;outreach@darpa.mil&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;text-align-center&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<h2 id="the-heirloom-project">The Heirloom Project</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-31, from: OS News</p>
<p>Update: there’s a fork called heirloom-ng that is actually still
somewhat maintained and contains some more changes and modernisations
compared to the old version. The Heirloom Project provides traditional
implementations of standard Unix utilities. In many cases, they have
been derived from original Unix material released as Open Source by
Caldera and Sun. Interfaces follow traditional practice; they remain
generally compatible with System V, although extensions that have become
common use over the course of time are sometimes provided. Most
utilities are also included in a variant that aims at POSIX conformance.
On the interior, technologies for the twenty-first century such as the
UTF-8 character encoding or OpenType fonts are supported. ↫ The Heirloom
Project website I had never heard of this before, but I like the
approach they’re taking. This isn’t just taking System V tools and
making them work on a modern UNIX-like system as-is; they’re also
improving by them adding support for modern technologies, without
actually changing their classic nature and the way old-fashioned users
expect them to work. Sadly, the project seems to be dead, as the code
hasn’t been altered since 2008. Perhaps someone new is willing to take
up this project? As it currently stands, the tools are available for
Linux, Solaris, Open UNIX, HP-UX, AIX, FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD, but
considering how long the code hasn’t been touched, I wonder if they
still run and work on any of those systems today. They also come in
various different versions which comply with different variants of the
POSIX standard.</p>

16’s Linux Terminal will soon let you run graphical apps, so of course
we ran Doom</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-31, from: OS News</p>
<p>Regardless, the fact that Android’s Linux Terminal can run graphical
apps like Doom now is good news. Hopefully we’ll be able to run more
complex desktop-class Linux programs in the future. I tried running
GIMP, for example, but it didn’t work. Eventually, Android should be
able to run Linux apps as well as Chromebooks can, as I believe one of
the goals of this project is to help the transition of Chrome OS to an
Android base. ↫ Mishaal Rahman at Android Authority It was of course
inevitable that someone would run Doom on Android’s new Debian
container, and it’s pretty cool to see it work without much issue
already, even if the new terminal and container setup are still in such
heavy development. Like many other people, I love the idea of my
smartphone being both my, well, smartphone, as well as a full desktop PC
once you connect it to a display and some input devices. As wireless
technology keeps advancing, we soon might not even need to plug anything
into the phone at all, and just having it in our pocket is good enough,
which would be amazing. That being said, I would want such functionality
to come from a traditional Linux setup, not Android’s idea of a Linux
setup. Running a Debian virtual machine on top of Android is probably
preferable for a lot of people for a variety of reasons, but I’m a Linux
user and want plain, regular Linux running directly on my smartphone,
not some virtual machine on Android, which, while being a Linux
distribution, is not the most pleasant variant of Linux to run and
use.</p>

Due to the statistical nature of machine learning, prior work has focused primarily on ensuring the robustness of AI-enabled systems at inference time due to natural degradations in performance caused by data distribution shifts, for example, from a highly dynamic deployment environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, as early as 2014, AI was demonstrated as being manipulable by adversary control of the input. Initial work has further confirmed the theoretical risks of data poisoning, physically constrained adversarial patches for evasion, and model stealing attacks. These attacks are typically tested in simulated or physical environments with relatively pristine control compared to what might be expected on a battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, there is no known reported capability that operationally assesses deployed military AI-enabled systems for adversarial vulnerabilities, so the “theoretical” adversarial AI attacks have not been practically demonstrated in operational settings. As a result, the operational security risks of AI-enabled battlefield systems, such as autonomous ground and aerial systems, remain unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Securing Artificial Intelligence for Battlefield Effective Robustness (SABER) aims to build an exemplar AI red team equipped with the necessary counter-AI techniques, tools, and technical competency to operationally assess AI-enabled battlefield systems while establishing a sustainable model for an operational AI red teaming process for the DoD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<h2 id="apples-macos-unix-certification-is-a-lie">Apple’s macOS UNIX
certification is a lie</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-29, from: OS News</p>
<p>As an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a someone
mentioning macOS is a UNIX approaches 1. In fact, it was only late last
year that The Open Group announced that macOS 15.0 was, once again,
certified as UNIX, continuing Apple’s long-standing tradition of
certifying macOS releases as “real” UNIX®. What does any of this
actually, mean, though? Well, it turns out that if you actually dive
into Apple’s conformance statements for macOS’ UNIX certification, it
doesn’t really mean anything at all. First and foremost, we have to
understand what UNIX certification really means. In order to be allowed
to use the UNIX trademark, your operating system needs to comply with
the Single UNIX Specification (SUS), which specifies programming
interfaces for C, a command-line shell, and user commands, more or less
identical to POSIX, as well as the X/Open Curses specification. The
latest version is SUS version 4, originally published in 2008, with
amendments published in 2013 and 2016, which were rolled up into version
4 in 2018. The various versions of the SUS that exist, in turn,
correspond to a specific UNIX trademark. In table form: Trademark SUS
version SUS published in: SUS last amended in: UNIX® 93 n.a. n.a. n.a.
UNIX® 95 Version 1 1994 n.a. UNIX® 98 Version 2 1997 n.a. UNIX® 03
Version 3 2002 2004 UNIX® V7 Version 4 2008 2016 (2018 for roll-up) When
you read that macOS is a certified UNIX, which of these versions and
trademarks do you assume macOS complies with? You’d assume they would
just target the latest trademark and SUS version, right? This would
allow macOS to carry the UNIX® V7 trademark, because they would conform
to version 4 of the SUS, which dates to 2016. The real answer is that
macOS 15.0 only conforms to version 3 of the SUS, which dates all the
way back to the ancient times of 2004, and as such, macOS is only UNIX®
03 (on both Intel and ARM). However, you can argue this is just
semantics, since it’s not like UNIX and POSIX are very inclined to
change. So now, like the UNIX nerd that you are, you want to see all
this for yourself. You use macOS, safe in the knowledge that unlike
those peasants using Linux or one of the BSDs, you’re using a real
UNIX®. So you can just download all the tests suites (if you can afford
them, but that’s a whole different can of worms) and run them,
replicating Apple’s compliance testing, seeing for yourself, on your own
macOS 15 installation, that macOS 15 is a real UNIX®, right? Well, no,
you can’t, because the version of macOS 15 Apple certifies is not the
version that’s running on everyone’s supported Macs. To gain its
much-vaunted UNIX certification for macOS, Apple cheats. A lot. The
various documents Apple needs to submit to The Open Group as part of the
UNIX certification process are freely available, and mostly it’s a lot
of very technical questions about various very specific aspects of
macOS’ UNIX and POSIX compliance few of us would be able to corroborate
without extensive research and in-depth knowledge of macOS, UNIX, and
POSIX. However, at the end of every one of these Conformance Statements,
there’s a text field where the applicant can write down “additional,
explanatory material that was provided by the vendor”, and it’s in these
appendices where we can see just how much Apple has to cheat to ensure
macOS passes the various UNIX® 03 certification tests. In the first of
these four documents, Internationalised System Calls and Libraries
Extended V3, Apple’s “additional, explanatory material” reads as
follows: Question 27: By default, core file generation is not enabled.
To enable core file generation, you can issue this command: sudo
launchctl limit core unlimited Testing Environment Addendum: macOS
version 15.0 Sequoia, like previous versions, includes an additional
security mechanism known as System Integrity Protection (SIP). This
security policy applies to every running process, including privileged
code and code that runs out of the sandbox. The policy extends
additional protections to components on disk and at run-time, only
allowing system binaries to be modified by the system installer and
software updates. Code injection and runtime attachments to system
binaries are no longer permitted. To run the VSX conformance test suite
we first disable SIP as follows: – Shut down the system.– Press and hold
the power button. Keep holding it while you see the Apple logo and the
message “Continue holding for startup options”– Release the power button
when you see “Loading startup options”– Choose “Options” and click
“Continue”– Select an administrator account and enter its password.–
From the Utilities menu in the Menu Bar, select Terminal.– At the
prompt, issue the following command: “csrutil disable”– You should see a
message that SIP is disabled. From the Apple menu, select “Restart”. By
default, macOS coalesces timeouts that are scheduled to occur within 5
seconds of each other. This can randomly cause some sleep calls to sleep
for different times than requested (which affects tests of file access
times) so we disable this coalescing when testing. To disable timeout
coalescing issue this command: sudo sysctl -w
kern.timer.coalescing_enabled=0 By default there is no root user. We
enable the root user for testing using the following series of steps:–
Launch the Directory Utility by pressing Command and Space, and then
typing “Directory Utility”– Click the Lock icon in Directory Utility and
authenticate by entering an Administrator username and password.– From
the Menu Bar in Directory Utility:– Choose Edit -&gt; Enable Root User.
Then enter a password for the root user, and confirm it.– Note: If you
choose, you can later Disable Root User via the same menu. ↫ Apple’s

6.14 with Rust: “We are almost at the ‘write a real driver in Rust’
stage now”</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-29, from: OS News</p>
<p>With the Linux 6.13 kernel, Greg Kroah-Hartman described the level of
Rust support as a “tipping point” for Rust drivers with more of the Rust
infrastructure having been merged. Now for the Linux 6.14 kernel, Greg
describes the state of the Rust driver possibilities as “almost at the
“write a real driver in rust” stage now, depending on what you want to
do.“ ↫ Michael Larabel Excellent news, as there’s a lot of interest in
Rust, and it seems that allowing developers to write drivers for Linux
in Rust will make at least some new and upcoming drivers comes with less
memory safety issues than non-Rust drivers. I’m also quite sure this
will anger absolutely nobody.</p>

it’s free to suck up whatever content and data it can find on the web

<p>Google, on its Google Maps naming policy, back in 2008: By saying
“common”, we mean to include names which are in widespread daily use,
rather than giving immediate recognition to any arbitrary governmental
re-naming. In other words, if a ruler announced that henceforth the
Pacific Ocean would be named after her mother, we would not add that
placemark unless and until the name came into common usage. Google,
today, in 2025: Google has confirmed that Google Maps will soon rename
the Gulf of Mexico and Denali mountain in Alaska as the “Gulf of
America” and “Mount McKinley” in line with changes implemented by the
Trump Administration, but users in the rest of the world may see two
names for these locations. Nothing is worth less than the word of a
corporation.</p>

audio format: the return of ZZM</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>Long-time readers will know that my first video game love was the
text-mode video game slash creation studio ZZT. One feature of this game
is the ability to play simple music through the PC speaker, and back in
the day, I remember that the format “ZZM” existed, so you could enjoy
the square wave tunes outside of the games. But imagine my surprise in
2025 to find that, while the Museum of ZZT does have a ZZM Audio
section, it recommends that nobody use the format anymore; because
nobody’s made a player that doesn’t require MS-DOS. Let’s fix that by
making a player with way higher system requirements, using everyone’s
favorite coding environment: Javascript. ↫ Nicole Branagan ZZM’s history
and Branagan’s journey to make this work without having to rely on DOS
took a lot more work than I expected, and is quite interesting, too.
Very niche, for sure, but that’s kind of what we’re here for.</p>

invalid 68030 instruction that accidentally allowed the Mac Classic II

<p>date: 2025-01-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>A bug in the ROM for the Macintosh II was recently discovered that
causes a crash when booting in 32-bit mode. Doug Brown discovered and
documented the bug while playing with the MAME debugger. Why did it
never show up before? It seems a quirk in Motorola’s 68030 CPU
inadvertently fixes it when executing an illegal instruction that
shouldn’t have been executed in the first place. What follows is his
process for investigating the room on emulated hardware, and then
testing it on actual hardware.</p>

Those are all valuable areas of effort that can contribute to achieving extended flight, but Albatross approaches the problem from a new angle and seeks to develop weather forecast-informed mission planning and real-time onboard sensing of dynamic wind conditions across multiple environments to harness energy from winds to offset the total power of the system required for flight.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This additional energy harvested from the wind reduces average power and allows the system to fly farther and longer. Aircraft soaring capabilities can be summarized as the active harnessing of energy from the natural environment’s atmospheric flow field to reduce the onboard power demand to enable increased range and endurance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Albatross is &lt;strong&gt;not &lt;/strong&gt;a dedicated airframe or aircraft design effort.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program is not focused on lowering the drag of the airframe or providing the highest energy density source. Rather, the focus is on developing and integrating planning tools, additional aircraft sensors, and unique control solutions applied to existing or otherwise quickly assembled small uncrewed aircraft to autonomously plan for, identify and respond to soaring conditions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Success is defined as capitalizing on soaring conditions to extend range and endurance in an operationally relevant manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

id="pebbleos-becomes-open-source-new-pebble-device-announced">PebbleOS
becomes open source, new Pebble device announced</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-27, from: OS News</p>
<p>Eric Migicovsky, founder of Pebble, the original smartwatch maker,
made a major announcement today together with Google. Pebble was
originally bought by Fitbit and in turn Fitbit was then bought by
Google, but Migicovsky always wanted to to go back to his original idea
and create a brand new smartwatch. PebbleOS took dozens of engineers
working over 4 years to build, alongside our fantastic product and QA
teams. Reproducing that for new hardware would take a long time.
Instead, we took a more direct route – I asked friends at Google (which
bought Fitbit, which had bought Pebble’s IP) if they could open source
PebbleOS. They said yes! Over the last year, a team inside Google
(including some amazing ex-Pebblers turned Googlers) has been working on
this. And today is the day – the source code for PebbleOS is now
available at github.com/google/pebble (see their blog post). ↫ Eric
Migicovsky Of course, this is amazing news for the still-thriving
community of Pebble users who have kept the platform and their devices
going through sheer force of will, but it also means Pebble is going to
making a comeback in a more official capacity: alongside the
announcement of PebbleOS becoming open source, there’s also the
unveiling of rePebble, a brand new Pebble watch that retains all of the
popular features and specifications of the original devices. It’ll run
the open source PebbleOS, of course, and will be compatible with the
existing ecosystem of applications. I’ve never had a Pebble, but there’s
no denying the company hit on something valuable, and I know people who
still rock their original Pebble devices to this day. The excitement
about this announcement is palpable, and I’m pleasantly surprised Google
cared enough to work on making an open source PebbleOS a reality (I know
of quite a few other companies sitting on deeply loved code and IP
rotting away in obscurity). I can’t wait to see what the new device will
look like!</p>

id="chinese-researchers-just-built-an-open-source-rival-to-chatgpt-in-2-months-and-silicon-valley-is-freaked-out">Chinese
researchers just built an open-source rival to ChatGPT in 2 months, and
Silicon Valley is freaked out</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-27, from: OS News</p>
<p>Speaking of “AI”, the Chinese company DeepSeek has lobbed a grenade
dead-centre into the middle of the “AI” bubble, and it’s been incredibly
entertaining to watch. DeepSeek has released several new “AI” models,
which seem to rival or even surpass OpenAI’s latest ChatGPT models – but
with a massive twist: DeepSeek, being Chinese, can’t use NVIDIA’s latest
GPUs, and as such, was forced to work within very tight constraints.
They’ve managed to surpass ChatGPT’s best models with a fraction of the
GPU horsepower, and thus a fraction of the cost, and a fraction of the
energy requirements. But unlike ChatGPT’s o1, DeepSeek is an
“open-weight” model that (although its training data remains
proprietary) enables users to peer inside and modify its algorithm. Just
as important is its reduced price for users — 27 times less than o1.
Besides its performance, the hype around DeepSeek comes from its cost
efficiency; the model’s shoestring budget is minuscule compared with the
tens of millions to hundreds of millions that rival companies spent to
train its competitors. ↫ Ben Turner at LiveScience The fallout has been
disastrous for NVIDIA, in particular. The company’s stock price tumbled
17% today, and more entertaining yet, the various massive investments of
hundreds of billions of dollars into western “AI” seem like a huge waste
of money. The DeepSeek models are also nominally open source, and are
clearly showing that most likely, there simply isn’t a huge “AI” market
worth hundreds of billions of dollars dollars at all. On top of that,
the US is clearly not ahead in “AI” at all, as was the common wisdom
pretty much until yesterday. Of course, DeepSeek is Chinese, and that
means censorship – the real kind – is a thing. Asking the latest
DeepSeek model about the massacre at Tiananmen Square returns nothing,
suggesting the user ask about other topics instead. I’m sure over the
coming weeks more and more or these kinds of censorship will be
discovered, but hopefully its open source nature will allow the models
to be adapted and changed to remove such censorship. Do note that all of
these “AI” models are all deeply biased because they’re trained on
content that is itself deeply biased, thereby perpetuating and
amplifying damaging stereotypes and inaccuracies, especially since
people have a tendency to assume computers can’t be biased. Whatever may
happen, at least OpenAI losing its job to “AI” is hilarious.</p>

Linux news site and others</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-27, from: OS News</p>
<p>Apparently, since the beginning of the year, AI bots have been
ensuring that websites can only respond to regular inquiries with a
delay. The founder of Linux Weekly News (LWN-net), Jonathan Corbet,
reports that the news site is therefore often slow to respond. The AI
scraper bots cause a DDoS, a distributed denial-of-service attack. At
times, the AI bots would clog the lines with hundreds of IP addresses
simultaneously as soon as they decided to access the site’s content.
Corbet explains on Mastodon that only a small proportion of the traffic
currently serves real human readers. ↫ Dirk Knop at Heise.de I’m sure
someone will tell me we just have to accept that a large percentage of
our bandwidth is going to overpriced bullshit generators, and that we
should just suck it up and pay for Sam Altman’s new house. I hope these
same people realise “AI” is destroying the last vestiges of the internet
that haven’t fallen victim to all the other techbro fads so far, and
that sooner rather than later there won’t be anything left to browse to.
The coming few years are going to be fun.</p>

a sole maintainer steps down, Linux drivers become orphans</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-25, from: OS News</p>
<p>The Linux kernel has become such an integral, core part of pretty
much all aspects of the technology world, and corporate contributions to
the kernel make up such a huge chunk of the kernel’s ongoing
development, it’s easy to forget that some parts of the kernel are still
maintained by some lone person in Jacksonville, Nebraska, or whatever.
Sadly, we were reminded of this today when the sole maintainer of a few
DRM (no, not the bad kind) announced he can no longer maintain the gud,
mi0283qt, panel-mipi-dbi, and repaper drivers. Remove myself as
maintainer for gud, mi0283qt, panel-mipi-dbi and repaper. My fatigue
illness has finally closed the door on doing development of even
moderate complexity so it’s sad to let this go. ↫ Noralf Trønnes There
must be quite a few obscure parts of the Linux kernel that are of no
interest to the corporate world, and thus remain maintained by
individuals in their free time, out of some personal need or perhaps a
sense of duty. If one such person gives up their role as maintainer, for
whatever reason, you better hope it’s not something your workflow
relies, because if no new maintainer is found, you will eventually run
into trouble. I hope Trønnes gets better soon, and if not, that someone
else can take over from him to maintain these drivers. The gud driver
seems like a really neat tool for homebrew projects, and it’d be sad to
see it languish as the years go by.</p>

16 Beta 1 has started rolling out for Pixel devices</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-25, from: OS News</p>
<p>Basically, this seems to mean applications will no longer be allowed
to limit themselves to phone size when running on devices with larger
screens, like tablets. Other tidbits in this first beta include
predictive back support for 3-button navigation, support for the
Advanced Professional Video codec from Samsung, among other things. It’s
still quite early in the release process, so more is sure to come, and
some things might not make it to the final release at all.</p>
