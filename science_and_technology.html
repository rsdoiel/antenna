      <h1>Microsoft publishes source code to Microsoft BASIC Version 1.1</h1>

(date: 2025-09-04, from: <a href="https://www.osnews.com/story/143274/microsoft-publishes-source-code-to-microsoft-basic-version-1-1/">OS News</a>)
      <p>
      This assembly language source code represents one of the most historically significant pieces of software from the early personal computer era. It is the complete source code for Microsoft BASIC Version 1.1 for the 6502 microprocessor, originally developed and copyrighted by Microsoft in 1976-1978. ↫ Microsoft BASIC Version 1.1 GitHub page An amazing historical artifact to have, and I&#8217;m glad we now have the source code available for posterity. I hope Microsoft gets on with it, though, as I think it&#8217;s high-time we get official open source releases of things like Windows 3.x, 95, earlier Office releases, and so on.

      <h1>Towards Rust in Windows drivers</h1>

(date: 2025-09-03, from: <a href="https://www.osnews.com/story/143263/towards-rust-in-windows-drivers/">OS News</a>)
      <p>
      Microsoft has been working on allowing driver developers to write Windows drivers in Rust, and the company has published a progress report detailing this effort. In the windows-drivers-rs GitHub repository you&#8217;ll find a bunch of Rust crates for writing Windows drivers in Rust. Using these crates, driver developers can create valid WDM, KMDF, and UMDF driver binaries that load and run on a Windows 11 machine.  Drivers written in this manner still need to make use of unsafe blocks for interacting with the Windows operating system, but can take advantage of Rust’s rich type system as well as its safety guarantees for business logic implemented in safe Rust.  Though there is still significant work to be done on abstracting away these unsafe blocks (more on this below), these Rust drivers can load and run on Windows systems just like their C counterparts. ↫ Nate Deisinger at the Windows Driver Developer Blog As mentioned above, there&#8217;s still work to be done with reducing the amount of unsafe Rust code in these drivers, and Microsoft is working on just that. The company is developing safe Rust bindings and abstractions, as well as additional safe structs and APIs beyond the Windows Driver Framework, but due to the complexity of Windows drivers, this will take a while. Microsoft states that it believes memory-safe languages like Rust are the future of secure software development, but of course, in true Microsoft fashion, the company doesn&#8217;t want to alienate developers writing traditional drivers in C either.

(date: 2025-09-03, from: <a href="https://www.osnews.com/story/143261/why-self-host-9front/">OS News</a>)
      <p>
      In 9front, we host almost all parts of our development process on 9front &#8212; the git repositories, the mailing list, the ci/cd, the web site, and everything else. (The exception is #cat-v IRC) We use the system regularly, both when hacking on the system and in our personal use. Personally, I write most of my code on Plan 9, read my emails there, and often drive Linux from there. I run my home network off of a 9front CPU server, and host my websites off it. I know other people around 9front do similar. ↫ Ori Bernstein It clearly shows, too. If you dive into the 9front community, you&#8217;ll quickly realise everything runs on 9front, and that does create a sense that the operating system is capable, and that its developers have confidence and pride in their work. Exploring 9front myself, it feels awesome to see that all the documentation I&#8217;m reading is being hosted on 9front machines. I&#8217;m going to relaunch the OSNews Gemini capsule, this time hosted on 9front, and since countless 9front users host their own Gemini capsules on 9front, I feel confident that I&#8217;ve got people to talk to when I need help. I just need the time to actually sit down and figure out the minutiae of 9front, because it truly is unique.

      <h1>Class justice: Google gets away with a gentle pat on the wrist for its illegal monopoly abuse</h1>

(date: 2025-09-02, from: <a href="https://www.osnews.com/story/143257/class-justice-google-gets-away-with-a-gentle-pat-on-the-wrist-for-its-illegal-monopoly-abuse/">OS News</a>)
      <p>
      A little over a year ago, DC District Court Judge Amit Mehta ruled that Google is a monopolist and violated US antitrust law. Today, Mehta ruled that while Google violated the law, there won&#8217;t be any punishment for the search giant. They don&#8217;t have to divest Chrome or Android, they can keep paying third parties to preload their services and products, and they can keep paying Apple €20 billion a year to be the default search engine on iOS. Mehta declined to grant some of the more ambitious proposals from the Justice Department to remedy Google’s behavior and restore competition to the market. Besides letting Google keep Chrome, he’ll also let the company continue to pay distribution partners for preloading or placement of its search or AI products. But he did order Google to share some valuable search information with rivals that could help jumpstart their ability to compete, and bar the search giant from making exclusive deals to distribute its search or AI assistant products in ways that might cut off distribution for rivals. ↫ Lauren Feiner at The Verge Mehta granted Google a massive win here, further underlining that as long as you&#8217;re wealthy, a corporation, or better yet, both, you are free to break the law and engage in criminal behaviour. The only thing you&#8217;ll get is some mild negative press and a gentle pat on the wrist, and you can be on your merry way to continue your illegal behaviour. None of it is surprising, except perhaps for the brazenness of the class justice on display here. The events during and course of this antitrust case mirrors those of the antitrust case involving Microsoft, over 25 years ago. Microsoft, too, had a long, documented, and proven history of illegal behaviour, but like Google today, also got away with a similar gentle pat on the wrist. It&#8217;s likely that the antitrust cases currently running against Apple and Amazon will end in similar gentle pats on the wrist, further solidifying that you can break the law all you want, as long as you&#8217;re rich. Thank god the real criminal scum is behind bars.

      <h1>A gentle introduction to CP/M</h1>

      <p>
      For an operating system that was once incredibly popular and expected to become a standard for a long time to come, it&#8217;s remarkable how little experience most people have with CP/M. In fact, many conventions and historical limitations you might be aware of &#8211; like the 8.3 filename convention of DOS &#8211; come straight from CP/M, as it influenced DOS considerably. It&#8217;s quite easy to emulate CP/M today, but it&#8217;s just old and different enough that getting into it might be a but confusing, but that&#8217;s where Eerie Linux&#8217;s introduction to CP/M comes into play. This article is just what the headline promises: an introduction to the CP/M operating system. No previous knowledge of 1970s and early ’80s operating systems is required. However, some familiarity with Linux or a BSD-style operating system is assumed, as the setup process suggested here involves using a package manager and command-line tools. But why explore CP/M in the 2020s? There are (at least) two good reasons: 1) historical education 2) gaining a better understanding of how computers actually work. ↫ Eerie Linux This article is a great way to get up and running with CP/M fairly quickly, and I intend to do just that when I find some time to mess around with it. What are some of the core, crucial applications that one should try on CP/M? Things people would be using back when CP/M was properly in use?

      My goal with this article is to share my perspectives on the web, as well as introduce many aspects of modern HTML/CSS you may not be familiar with. I’m not trying to make you give up JavaScript, I’m just trying to show you everything that’s possible, leaving it up to you to pick what works best for whatever you’re working on. I think there’s a lot most web developers don’t know about CSS. And I think JS is often used where better alternatives exist. So, let me show you what’s out there.  ↫ Lyra Rebane As someone who famously can&#8217;t program, the one thing I like about CSS is that I find it quite readable and generally easy to figure out how I can change things like colours, fonts, and so on. Of course, anything more complex will still break my brain, but even the more complex elements are still at least nominally readable, and it&#8217;s often quite easy to determine what a piece of CSS does, even if I don&#8217;t know how to manipulate it or how to get even close to any desired result. It&#8217;s like how the fact I learned Latin and French in high school makes it possible for me to nominally understand a text in Spanish, even if I have never spent a single second studying it. JavaScript, on the other hand, is just a black box, incomprehensible gibberish I can&#8217;t make heads or tails of, which in my mind goes against what the web is supposed to be about. The web is supposed to be an open platform in more ways than one, and the ability to make a website should not be hidden behind complex programming languages or website builder gatekeepers. The fact JavaScript is a resource hog and misused all over the place sure doesn&#8217;t help, either. If you want to know more about the current state of CSS, the linked article by Lyra Rebane is a great place to start. I wish I had the skills to finally give OSNews a full makeover, but alas, I don&#8217;t.

      <p>
      Jussi Pakkanen, creator of the Meson build system, has some words about modules in C++. If C++ modules can not show a 5× compilation time speedup (preferably 10×) on multiple existing open source code base, modules should be killed and taken out of the standard. Without this speedup pouring any more resources into modules is just feeding the sunk cost fallacy. That seems like a harsh thing to say for such a massive undertaking that promises to make things so much better. It is not something that you can just belt out and then mic drop yourself out. So let&#8217;s examine the whole thing in unnecessarily deep detail. You might want to grab a cup of $beverage before continuing, this is going to take a while. ↫ Jussi Pakkanen I&#8217;m not a programmer so I&#8217;m leaving this for the smarter people among us to debate.

      <p>
      The months keep slipping through our fingers, during this, our slow but relentless march towards the inevitability of certain death, so it&#8217;s time for another month of improvements to Redox, the general-purpose microkernel operating system written in Rust. This past month the work to bring various components of system76&#8217;s COSMIC desktop environment to Redox continues, with COSMIC Reader making its way to Redox. Jeremy Soller, creator of the Redox project and one of its primary engineers, will be using COSMIC Reader running on Redox to hold a presentation about Redox at RustConf. Aside from that important port, this month &#8211; in the middle of Summer on in this hemisphere &#8211; seems to mostly consist of a ton of smaller bugfixes and improvements. Relibc, Redox&#8217; C standard library, has seen a ton of work, as usual, a few ports were fixed and updated, like vim and OpenSSH, Orbital now has fullscreen support, and so, so much more.

      <h1>Apparently, Windows antivirus marking Linux ISOs as malware is a common issue</h1>

(date: 2025-09-01, from: <a href="https://www.osnews.com/story/143238/apparently-windows-antivirus-marking-linux-isos-as-malware-is-a-common-issue/">OS News</a>)
      <p>
      DistroWatch&#8217;s Jesse Smith is bringing some attention to an issue I have never encountered and had never heard of, and it has to do with antivirus software on Windows. It seems it&#8217;s not uncommon for antivirus software on Windows to mark Linux ISOs as malware or otherwise dangerous, and it seems people are reporting these findings to DistroWatch, for some reason. DistroWatch makes it clear they don&#8217;t host any of the ISOs, and that close to all of these warnings from antivirus software are false positives. So why do multiple Windows virus scanners report that they find malware in Linux downloads? Putting aside the obvious conspiracy theories about anti-virus vendors not wanting to lose customers, what is probably happening is the scanners are detecting an archive file (the ISO) which contains executable code, and flagging it as suspicious. Some of the code is even able to change the disk layout, which is something that looks nasty from a security point of view. It&#8217;s entirely understandable that a malware scanner which sees an archive full of executable code that could change the way the system boots would flag it as dangerous. ↫ Jesse Smith at DistroWatch I wonder how many people curious about Linux downloaded an ISO, only to delete is after their Windows antivirus marked it as dangerous. I can&#8217;t imagine the number to be particularly high &#8211; if you&#8217;re downloading a Linux ISO, you&#8217;re probably knowledgeable enough to figure out it&#8217;s a false positive &#8211; but apparently it&#8217;s a big enough issue that DistroWatch needs to inform its readers about it, which is absolutely wild to me.

      Another small release for the IceWM window manager &#8211; one of the staples of the open source world. IceWM 3.9.0 seems focused mostly on cursor-related changes, as it adds libXcursor as an alternative to XPM cursors. This means IceWM is no longer dependent on libXpm, and gains the benefits that come with Xcursor. There&#8217;s the usual few bugfixes and translation updates as well.

(date: 2025-08-31, from: <a href="https://www.osnews.com/story/143231/the-first-computer-linux-was-ever-installed-on/">OS News</a>)
      <p>
      I stumbled upon an LWN.net article from 2023, in which Lars Wirzenius, a long-time Debian developer and friend of Linus Torvalds, recalls the very early days of Linux &#8211; in fact, before it was even called Linux. There&#8217;s so many fun little stories in here, like how the Linux kernel started out as a multitasking demo written in x86 assembly, which did nothing more than write As and Bs on the screen, or the fact Linux was originally called Freax before Ari Lemmke, one of the administrators of ftp.funet.fi, opted for the name &#8220;Linux&#8221; when uploading the first release. However, my favourite story is about what installing Linux was like during those early days. During this time, people were interested in trying out this new thing, so Linus needed to provide an installation method and instructions. Since he only had one PC, he came to visit to install it on mine. Since his computer had been used to develop Linux, which had simply grown on top of his Minix installation, it had never actually been installed before. Thus, mine was the first PC where Linux was ever installed. While this was happening, I was taking a nap, and I recommend this method of installing Linux: napping, while Linus does the hard work. ↫ Lars Wirzenius at LWN.net The entire article is a joy to read, and since it&#8217;s from 2023, I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m late to the party and none of it is news to many of you. On a more topical note, Wirzenius published a short article today detailing why he still uses Debian, after all these decades.

      <h1>EDK2: UEFI for the ROCK 5 ITX+ ARM board</h1>

(date: 2025-08-31, from: <a href="https://www.osnews.com/story/143229/edk2-uefi-for-the-rock-5-itx-arm-board/">OS News</a>)
      <p>
      I am a huge fan of my&#160;Rock 5 ITX+. It wraps an ATX power connector, a 4-pin Molex, PoE support, 32 GB of eMMC, front-panel USB 2.0, and two Gen 3×2 M.2 slots around a Rockchip 3588 SoC that can slot into any Mini-ITX case. Thing is, I never put it in a case because the microSD slot lives on the side of the board, and pulling the case out and removing the side panel to install a new OS got old with a quickness. I originally wanted to rackmount the critter, but adding a deracking difficulty multiplier to the microSD slot minigame seemed a bit souls-like for my taste. So what am I going to do? Grab a microSD extender and hang that out the back? Nay! I’m going to neuralyze the SPI flash and install some Kelvin Timeline firmware that will allow me to boot and install generic ARM Linux images from USB. ↫ Interfacing Linux Using EDK2 to add UEFI to an ARM board is awesome, as it solves some of the most annoying problems of these ARM boards: they require custom images specifically prepared for the board in question. After flashing EDK2 to this board, you can just boot any ARM Linux distribution &#8211; or Windows, NetBSD, and so on &#8211; from USB and install it from there. There&#8217;s still a ton of catches, but it&#8217;s a clear improvement. The funniest detail for sure, at least for this very specific board, is that the SPI flash is exposed as a block device, so you can just use, say the GNOME Disk Utility to flash any new firmware into it. The board in question is a Radxa ROCK 5 ITX+, and they&#8217;re not all that expensive, so I&#8217;m kind of tempted here. I&#8217;m not entirely sure what I&#8217;d need yet another computer for, honestly, but it&#8217;s not like that&#8217;s ever stopped any of us before.

      <h1>It turns out Nokia’s legendary font makes for a great general user interface font</h1>

(date: 2025-08-29, from: <a href="https://www.osnews.com/story/143222/it-turns-out-nokias-legendary-font-makes-for-a-great-general-user-interface-font/">OS News</a>)
      <p>
      If you&#8217;re of a certain age (and not American), there&#8217;s a specific corporate font you&#8217;re most likely aware of. You may not know its exact name, and you may not actively remember it, but once you see it, you know exactly what you&#8217;re looking at. The font&#8217;s called Nokia Sans (and Nokia Serif), and it was used by pretty much every single Nokia device between roughly 2002 and 2013 or so, when it was replaced by a very bland font made by Bruno Maag (with help from the person who designed Comic Sans) that they used after that. I can&#8217;t remember why, exactly, but I got majorly nostalgic for Nokia&#8217;s characteristic, recognisable font, and decided to see if it would work as a user interface font. Now, the font is still owned by Nokia and I couldn&#8217;t find a proper place to download it, but I eventually stumbled upon a site that had each individual variant listed for download. I downloaded each of them, installed them using KDE&#8217;s font installation method, and tried it out as my user interface font. You&#8217;ll quickly discover you shouldn&#8217;t use the regular variant, but should instead opt for the Nokia Sans Wide variant. Back in 2011, when Nokia originally announced it was replacing Nokia Sans, the creator of the font, Erik Spiekermann, responded to the announcement on his blog. Apparently, one of the major reasons for Nokia to change fonts was that they claimed Nokia Sans wouldn&#8217;t work as a user interface font, but Spiekermann obviously disagrees, pointing specifically to the Wide variant. In fact, Spiekermann does not pull any punches. After 10 years it was high time to look at Nokia’s typefaces as the dominant visual voice of the brand but whoever decided on a completely new direction was either not aware of what was available or was persuaded by Bruno Maag to start over. Bruno may not create the most memorable typefaces, but he certainly knows how to sell them. And technically, their fonts are excellent. Too bad they didn’t have the confidence to work with me on an update. Instead they’re throwing out ten years of brand recognition in favour of blandness. ↫ Erik Spiekermann I was pleasently surprised by just how nice the font looks when used as a general user interface font. It&#8217;s extremely legible at a variety of sizes, and has a ton of character without becoming gimmicky or overbearing. What originally started as mere curiosity has now become my UI font of choice on all my machines, finally displacing Inter after many years of uncontested service. Of course, all of this is deeply personal and 95% an issue of taste, but I wanted to write about it to see if I&#8217;m just entirely crazy, or if there&#8217;s some method to my madness. Do note that I&#8217;m using high DPI displays, and KDE on Wayland, and that all of this may look different on Windows or macOS, or on displays with lower DPI. One of Inter&#8217;s strengths is that it renders great on both high and lower DPI displays, but since I don&#8217;t have any lower DPI displays anymore, I can&#8217;t test it in such an environment. I&#8217;m also not entirely sure about the legal status of downloading fonts like this, but I am fairly sure you&#8217;re at least allowed to use non-free fonts for personal, non-commercial use, but please don&#8217;t quote me on that. Since downloading each variant of these Nokia fonts is annoying, I&#8217;d love to create and upload a zip file containing all of them, but I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s illegal. I&#8217;m not a font connoisseur, so I may be committing a huge faux pas here? Not that I care, but reading about font nerds losing their minds over things I never even noticed is always highly entertaining.

      <p>
      Blocky Planet is a tech demo I created in the&#160;Unity game engine&#160;that attempts to map Minecraft’s cubic voxels onto a spherical planet. The planet is procedurally generated and fully destructible, allowing players to place or remove more than 20 different block types. While much of the implementation relies on common techniques you’d expect from your average Kirkland brand Minecraft clone, the spherical structure introduces a number of unique design considerations. This post will focus on these more novel challenges. ↫ Bowerbyte What a great read. Turning a &#8216;flat earth&#8217; game like Minecraft into something taking place on a spherical world seems impossible at first, but it seems Bowerbyte managed to do it. If you&#8217;ve ever wondered what it would be like to play a Minecraft-like game on an actual sphere, this is it.

(date: 2025-08-28, from: <a href="https://www.osnews.com/story/143214/genode-os-framework-25-08-released/">OS News</a>)
      <p>
      Genode 25.08 is ripe with deeply technical topics that have been cooking since the beginning of the year or even longer. In particular our new kernel scheduler as the flagship feature of this release has been in the works since February 2024. Section&#160;Kernel scheduling for fairness and low latency&#160;tells its background story and explains the approach taken. Another culmination of a long-term endeavor is the introduction of an alternative to XML syntax, specifically designed for the usage patterns of Genode and Sculpt OS. Section&#160;Consideration of a lean alternative to XML&#160;kicks off the practical evaluation of an idea that gradually evolved over more than two years. Also the holistic storage optimizations presented in Section&#160;Block-storage stack renovations&#160;are the result of careful long-term analysis, planning, and execution. ↫ Genode 25.08 release notes While these are the three tentpole features for this release, there&#8217;s a whole lot more here, as well. Genode&#8217;s Linux-based PC device drivers have all been updated to Linux 6.12, there are a ton of fixes related to USB, optional EFI boot support in VirtualBox 6, and tons more.

      <h1>The EU needs a corporate “open source contribution tax” to fund open source maintainers</h1>

(date: 2025-08-28, from: <a href="https://www.osnews.com/story/143211/the-eu-needs-a-corporate-open-source-contribution-tax-to-fund-open-source-maintainers/">OS News</a>)
      <p>
      Open source, the thing that drives the world, the thing Harvard says has an economic value of 8.8 trillion dollars (also a big number). Most of it is one person. And I can promise you not one of those single person projects have the proper amount of resources they need. If you want to talk about possible risks to your supply chain, a single maintainer that’s grossly underpaid and overworked. That’s the risk. The country they are from is irrelevant. ↫ Josh Bressers If the massive corporations that exploit the open source world for massive personal profit don&#8217;t want to contribute back, perhaps it&#8217;s time we start making them. I envision an European Economic Area-wide &#8220;open source contribution tax&#8221;, levied against any technology corporation operating within the European Economic Area, whether they actually make use of open source code or not, not entirely unlike how insurance works &#8211; you pay into it even if you don&#8217;t make any claims. Such tax could be based on revenue, number of users, or any combination thereof or other factors. The revenue from this open source contribution tax is put into an EEA-wide fund and redistributed to EEA-based open source maintainers in the form of a monetary subsidy. Such types of taxes and money redistribution frameworks already exist in virtually every country for a whole wide variety of purposes and in a wide variety of forms, both in non-commercial and commercial settings. While it may seem complicated at first, it really isn&#8217;t. The most difficult aspect is definitely figuring out who, exactly, would be eligible to receive the subsidy and how much, but that, too, is a question both governments and commercial entities answer every single day. No, it will never be perfect, and some people will receive a subsidy who shouldn&#8217;t, and some who should receive it will not, but if that&#8217;s a valid reason not to implement a tax like this, no tax or insurance should be implemented. The benefits are legion. Of course, there is the primary benefit of alleviating the thousands of open source maintainers who form the backbone of pretty much out entire digital infrastructure, which in and of itself should be reason enough. On top of that, it would also strengthen the open source world &#8211; on which, I wish to reiterate, our entire digital infrastructure is built &#8211; against the kind of infiltration we saw with XZ Utils. And to put another top on top of that, it would cement Europe, or the EEA more specifically, as the hub for open source development, innovation, and leadership, and would surely attract countless open source maintainers to relocate to Europe. In other words, it would serve the grander European ambition to become less dependent on the criminal behaviour US tech giants and the erratic behaviour of the US government. We can either wait indefinitely for those who exploit the free labour of open source maintainers to contribute, or we make them.

<p>This seemed trivial at the time - just add the missing components.  However, when the fix went into review and we looked deeper, it turned out to be anything but trivial.</p>

      <h1>In-application browsers: the worst erosion of user choice you haven’t heard of</h1>

(date: 2025-08-28, from: <a href="https://www.osnews.com/story/143207/in-application-browsers-the-worst-erosion-of-user-choice-you-havent-heard-of/">OS News</a>)
      <p>
      A long, long time ago, Android treated browser tabs in a very unique way. Individual tabs were were seen as &#8216;applications&#8217;, and would appear interspersed with the recent applications list as if they were, indeed, applications. This used to be one of my favourite Android features, as it made websites feel very well integrated into the overall user experience, and gave them a sense of place within your workflows. Eventually, though, Google decided to remove this unique approach, as we can&#8217;t have nice things and everything must be bland, boring, and the same, and now finding a website you have open requires going to your browser and finding the correct tab. More approachable to most people, I&#8217;d wager, but a reduction in usability, for me. I still mourn this loss. Similarly, we&#8217;ve seen a huge increase in the use of in-application browsers, a feature designed to trap users inside applications, instead of letting them freely explore the web the moment they click on a link inside an application. Application developers don&#8217;t want you leaving their application, so almost all of them, by default, will now open a webview inside the application when you click on an outbound link. For advertising companies, like Google and Facebook, this has the additional benefit of circumventing any and all privacy protections you may have set up in your browser, since those won&#8217;t apply to the webview the application opens. This sucks. I hate in-application browsers with a passion. Decades of internet use have taught me that clicking on a link means I&#8217;m opening a website in my browser. That&#8217;s what I want, that&#8217;s what I expect, and that&#8217;s how it should be. In-application webviews entirely break this normal chain of events; not because it improves the user experience, but because it benefits the bottom line of others. It&#8217;s also a massive security risk. Worst of all, this switch grants these apps the ability to spy and manipulate third-party websites. Popular apps like Instagram, Facebook Messenger and Facebook have all been caught injecting JavaScript via their in-app browsers into third party websites. TikTok was running commands that were essentially a keylogger. While we have no proof that this data was used or exfiltrated from the device, the mere presence of JavaScript code collecting this data combined with no plausible explanation is extremely concerning. ↫ Open Web Advocacy Open Web Advocacy has submitted a detailed and expansive report to the European Commission detailing the various issues with these in-application browsers, and suggests a number of remedies to strengthen security, improve privacy, and preserve browser choice. I hope this gets picked up, because in-application browsers are just another way in which we&#8217;re losing control over our devices.

      <h1>Word to save new files on Microsoft’s servers by default</h1>

(date: 2025-08-28, from: <a href="https://www.osnews.com/story/143202/word-to-save-new-files-on-microsofts-servers-by-default/">OS News</a>)

      You already need custom scripts and third-party applications that make custom Windows ISOs to make installing Windows somewhat bearable &#8211; unless you enjoy spending hours manually disabling all the anti-user settings in Windows &#8211; and now there&#8217;s another setting to add to the massive, growing list of stuff you have to fix after setting up a new Windows installation. Microsoft has announced that Word will start saving every new file to OneDrive (or another provider if you&#8217;ve installed one) by default. We are modernizing the way files are created and stored in Word for Windows! Now you don’t have to worry about saving your documents: Anything new you create will be saved automatically to OneDrive or your preferred cloud destination. ↫ Raul Munoz on the Microsoft 365 Insider Blog There&#8217;s the usual spiel of how this is safer and supposedly more convenient, but I suspect the real reason Microsoft is doing this is listed right there at the end of the list of supposed benefits: this enables the use of Copilot&#8217;s &#8220;AI&#8221; features right from the beginning. In other words, by automatically saving your new Word documents to OneDrive by default, you&#8217;re giving Microsoft access to whatever you write for &#8220;AI&#8221; training purposes. The setting can be changed, but defaults matter and few people change them. It&#8217;s also possible to set another provider than OneDrive as your online storage, but again &#8211; defaults matter. In fact, I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if few people will even realise their Word documents will be stored not on their local PC, but on Microsoft&#8217;s servers.

      <p>
      Patagonia, Chile. Left: September 18, 1986. Right: August 5, 2002. The 1986 image shows the region prior to a major retreat of the glaciers. The 2002 image shows a retreat of nearly 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) of the glacier on the left side. The smaller glacier on the right has receded more than 2 kilometers (1.2 miles). In front of the smaller glacier, two ribbon lakes have formed behind the debris left by the glacier’s advance. Scientists and government managers are using satellite imagery like this to monitor the retreat of the glaciers and the impact on water bodies caused by the changes in the glaciers’ size and direction.

      <h1>Dick Pick’s unique database operating system</h1>

(date: 2025-08-26, from: <a href="https://www.osnews.com/story/143184/dick-picks-unique-database-operating-system/">OS News</a>)
      <p>
      We usually at least recognize old computer hardware and software names. But Asianmoetry taught us a new one: Pick OS. This 1960s-era system was sort of a database and sort of an operating system for big iron used by the Army. The request was for an English-like query language, and TRW assigned two guys, Don Nelson and Dick Pick, to the job. The planned query language would allow for things like “list the title, author, and abstract of every transportation system reference with the principal city ‘Los Angeles’.” This was GIM or generalized information management, and, in a forward-looking choice, it ran in a virtual machine. ↫ Al Williams at Hackaday The linked article is a short summary of a YouTube video by the YouTube channel Asianometry, which goes into a lot more detail about Pick OS, where it came from, what it can do, who the people involved were, and where Pick OS eventually ended up. I had never heard of this system before, and it&#8217;s easy to see why &#8211; not only was it used almost exclusively in vertically integrated complete solutions, it was also whitelabeled, so it existed under countless different names. Regardless, it seems the people who actually had to use it were incredibly enthusiastic about it, and to this day you can read new comments from people fondly remembering how easy to use it was. It has always been proprietary, and still is to this day, apparently owned by a company called Rocket Software, who don&#8217;t seem to actually be doing anything with it.

      <h1>Guix gets a new Rust packaging model</h1>

(date: 2025-08-26, from: <a href="https://www.osnews.com/story/143182/guix-gets-a-new-rust-packaging-model/">OS News</a>)
      <p>
      While Nix and NixOS get all the attention when it comes to declarative package management, there are other, competing implementations of the same general idea. Guix, developed as part of the GNU Project, was originally based on Nix, but grew into its own thing. The project recently announced a major change to how it packages Rust and its countless dependencies and optional &#8216;crates&#8217;. We have changed to a simplified Rust packaging model that is easier to automate and allows for modification, replacement and deletion of dependencies at the same time. The new model will significantly reduce our Rust packaging time and will help us to improve both package availability and quality. ↫ Hilton Chain at the Guix blog I hear people talk about Nix and NixOS all the time &#8211; I tried it myself, too, but I felt I was using an IBM z17 mainframe to watch a YouTube video &#8211; and in fact, Nix has kind of become a meme in and of itself, but you never hear people talk about Guix. With this being OSNews, I&#8217;m assuming there&#8217;s going to be people here using it, and I&#8217;m incredibly curious about your experiences. What are the features and benefits that make you use it? If you&#8217;re curious &#8211; the best way to try Guix is probably to install the GNU Guix System, the Linux distribution built around Guix and Shepard, GNU&#8217;s alternative init system. It&#8217;s available for i686, x86_64, ARMv7, and AArch64, and can be virtualised too, of course.

      I recently moved to an area with more internet provider options, all of which were not satellite-based. This change allowed me leave my current provider (Starlink) and also freed my network from being locked behind CGNAT. The jump from ~150Mbps to 1Gbps has been fantastic, but the real benefit in this switch has been the ability to overhaul my home network setup. ↫ Bradley Taunt OpenBSD is generally the way to go for custom router setups, it seems, and if it wasn&#8217;t for my own full Ubiquiti setup, I&#8217;d definitely consider this too.

      <h1>Google to require developer certification to install Android applications, even outside of the Play Store</h1>

(date: 2025-08-25, from: <a href="https://www.osnews.com/story/143173/google-to-require-developer-certification-to-install-android-applications-even-outside-of-the-play-store/">OS News</a>)
      <p>
      Google&#8217;s grip on Android keeps tightening. In what will certainly be another step that we will look back upon as just another nail in the coffin, Google is going to require every Android developer to register with Google, even if they don&#8217;t publish anything in the Play Store. In other words, even if you develop Android applications ad only make them available through F-Droid or GitHub, you&#8217;ll still have to register with Google and hand over a bunch of personal information and a small fee of $25. Google is effectively recreating Apple&#8217;s Gatekeeper for macOS, but on Android. It won&#8217;t come as a surprise to you that Google is doing this in the name of security and protecting users. The company claims that its own analysis found &#8220;over 50 times more malware from internet-sideloaded sources than on apps available through Google Play&#8221;, and the main reason is that malware developers can hide behind anonymity. As such, Google&#8217;s solution is to simply deanonymise every single Android developer. Starting next year, Android will require all apps to be registered by verified developers in order to be installed by users on certified Android devices. This creates crucial accountability, making it much harder for malicious actors to quickly distribute another harmful app after we take the first one down. Think of it like an ID check at the airport, which confirms a traveler&#8217;s identity but is separate from the security screening of their bags; we will be confirming who the developer is, not reviewing the content of their app or where it came from. This change will start in a few select countries specifically impacted by these forms of fraudulent app scams, often from repeat perpetrators. ↫ Suzanne Frey at the Android Developer Blog This new policy will only apply to &#8220;certified Android devices&#8221;, which means Android devices that ship with Google Play Services and all related Google stuff preinstalled. How this policy will affect devices running de-Googled Android ROMs like GrapheneOS where the user has opted to install the Play Store and Google Play Services is unclear. Google does claim the personal information you hand over as part of your registration will remain entirely private and not be shown to anyone, but that&#8217;s not going to reassure anyone. To its small credit, Google intends to create an Android Developer Console explicitly for developers who only operate outside of the Play Store, and a special workflow for students and hobbyists that waives the $25 fee. First tests will start in October of this year, with an official rollout in a number of countries later in 2026, which will then expand to cover the whole world. The first countries seeing the official rollout will be countries hit especially hard by scams (according to Google&#8217;s research, at least): Brazil, Indonesia, Singapore, and Thailand. Google has been trying to claw back control over Android for years now, and it seems the pace is accelerating lately. None of these steps should surprise you, but they should highlight just how crucially important it is that we somehow managed to come to a viable third way, something not controlled by either Apple or Google.

      <h1>“I revived pkgsrc on AIX”</h1>

(date: 2025-08-25, from: <a href="https://www.osnews.com/story/143168/i-revived-pkgsrc-on-aix/">OS News</a>)
      <p>
      Earlier this year, I was trying to get actual daily work done on HP-UX 11.11 (11i v1) running on HP&#8217;s last and greatest PA-RISC workstation, the HP c8000. After weeks of frustration caused first by outdated software no longer working properly with the modern web, and then by modern software no longer compiling on HP-UX 11.11, I decided to play the ace up my sleeve: NetBSD&#8217;s pkgsrc has support for HP-UX. Sadly, HP-UX is obviously not a main platform or even a point of interest for pkgsrc developers &#8211; as it should be, nobody uses this combination &#8211; so various incompatibilities and more modern requirements had snuck into pkgsrc, and I couldn&#8217;t get it to bootstrap. I made some minor progress here and there with the help of people far smarter than I, but in the end I just lacked the skills to progress any further. This story will make it to OSNews in a more complete form, I promise. Anyway, in May of this year, it seems Brian Robert Callahan was working on a very similar problem: getting pkgsrc to work properly on IBM&#8217;s AIX. The state of packages on AIX genuinely surprises me. IBM hosts a&#160;repository&#160;of open source software for AIX. But it seems pretty sparse compared to what you&#160;could&#160;get with pkgsrc. Another&#160;website&#160;offering AIX packages seems quite old. I think pkgsrc would be a great way to bring modern packages to AIX. I am not the first to think this. There are AIX 7.2 pkgsrc packages available at&#160;this repository, however all the packages are compiled as 32-bit RISC System/6000 objects. I would greatly prefer to have everything be 64-bit XCOFF objects, as we could do more with 64-bit programs. There also aren&#8217;t too many packages in that repository, so I think starting fresh is in our best interest. As we shall see, this was not as straightforward as I would have hoped. ↫ Brian Robert Callahan Reading through his journey getting pkgsrc to work properly on AIX, I can&#8217;t help but feel a bit better about myself not being to get it to work on HP-UX 11.11. Callahan was working with AIX 7.2 TL4, which was released in November 2019 and still actively supported by IBM on a maintained architecture, while I was working with HP-UX 11.11 (or 11i v1), which last got some updates in and around 2005, running on an architecture that&#8217;s well dead and buried. Looking at what Callahan still had to figure out and do, it&#8217;s not surprising someone with my lack of skill in this area couldn&#8217;t get it working. I&#8217;m still hoping someone far smarter than I stumbles upon a HP c8000 and dives into getting pkgsrc to work on HP-UX, because I feel pkgsrc could turn an otherwise incredibly powerful HP c8000 from a strictly retro machine into something borderline usable in the modern world. HP-UX is much harder to virtualise &#8211; if it&#8217;s even possible at all &#8211; so real hardware is probably going to be required. The NetBSD people on Mastodon suggested I could possibly give remote access to my machine so someone could dive into this, which is something I&#8217;ll keep under consideration.

      <h1>Windows 11 to get ability to resume applications from Android which nobody will implement</h1>

(date: 2025-08-25, from: <a href="https://www.osnews.com/story/143165/windows-11-to-get-ability-to-resume-applications-from-android-which-nobody-will-implement/">OS News</a>)
      <p>
      The history of Android applications on Windows is convoluted, with various failed and cancelled attempts by Microsoft to allow Windows users to run Android applications behind us. Now that these attempts are well dead and buried, Microsoft is going at it from a different perspective: what if you could continue where you left off on your Android phone, right on your Windows machine, but without having to run an Android applications on Windows? We are beginning to gradually roll out the ability to seamlessly resume using your favorite apps from your Android phone on your Windows 11 PC to Windows Insiders in the Dev and Beta Channels. To start with, you will be able to resume or continue listening to your favorite Spotify tracks and episodes right from where you left off on the Spotify app on your Android phone. First, start listening to one of your favorite songs or episodes in the Spotify app on your Android phone. On your PC (running the latest Insider Preview builds in the Dev or Beta Channels) a ‘Resume alert’&#160;will appear on&#160;your taskbar. When you click on that alert, Spotify’s desktop app will open and the same track will now continue playing on your PC. ↫ Amanda Langowski and Brandon LeBlanc So basically, the Spotify application on Windows will know where you left off on the Spotify application on Android, and resume playback. This is table-stakes for most services, and it doesn&#8217;t seem like it would warrant such a big announcement from Microsoft, and while I don&#8217;t use Spotify, I assume it was already built into the service anyway. It seems all Microsoft is doing is providing a nice little notification to expose that functionality a little bit more clearly, but it also explains that you need to manually link your device and the Spotify Android application to the Windows PC and Spotify Windows application, which seems like a lot of manual steps. Does this mean every application developer needs to opt into this and add this feature, thereby making it dead on arrival? Well, yes, you&#8217;ll need to add support on both sides of the equation, which I can guarantee you very few developers will do. Not only does this feature require you to already have a Windows version of your application &#8211; which, statistically, you don&#8217;t &#8211; it also requires you to do the work yourself, and manually apply to Microsoft to even gain access to the required APIs and SDKs. The odds of this feature making it beyond a few very big names Microsoft can give money to is slim.

      I have a slight problem wherein every time I start up a game of NetHack, I completely lose touch with my surroundings for hours on end. Thankfully&#160;The DevTeam Thinks Of Everything&#160;and there’s a solution that allows communication with the outside world without breaking immersion: the mail daemon! If compiled with&#160;-DMAIL&#160;and&#160;OPTIONS=mail&#160;is set in your runtime configuration (the default on Linux), NetHack will periodically check a user specified mbox file (MAIL) for new mail, and upon receiving an email a mail daemon will spawn in and deliver a scroll of mail to the player. Upon reading this scroll a mail program (MAILREADER) will be executed, which hopefully allows you to read your mail. ↫ George Huebner I love everything about this.

      <h1>Nitro: a tiny but flexible init system and process supervisor</h1>

(date: 2025-08-24, from: <a href="https://www.osnews.com/story/143156/nitro-a-tiny-but-flexible-init-system-and-process-supervisor/">OS News</a>)
      <p>
      The most unlikely subsystem of contention is definitely the init system used by Linux, with most popular distributions opting for systemd, while a vocal minority prefers to use something else. Neither of these two groups are wrong or right, as we live in a free world and different people have different needs and desires. Personally, I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s a more utterly pointless and meaningless debate than this, and people who make the init system they use their entire personality more often than not come across as really, really sad. It&#8217;s a tool; use the one you like and move on with life. A brand new init system was recently released by Leah Neukirchen, who among a ton of other things, contributes to Void Linux. It&#8217;s called nitro, and it&#8217;s a &#8220;tiny process supervisor that also can be used as pid 1 on Linux&#8221;, and it also can be used on FreeBSD supervised by FreeBSD&#8217;s init. There&#8217;s some overlap with runit here, so Neukirchen published a blog post detailing the differences between the two, which should help in getting a better understanding of what makes nitro stand apart. While both use a directory of services managed by small scripts, nitro seems to opt for a more contained, monolithic approach, as it keeps everything in a single process. On top of that, Nitro contains some new features runit doesn&#8217;t have. The focus seems to be on integrating a few capabilities that on runit require hacks, but on nitro are just built-in, like &#8220;support for one-shot &#8216;services&#8217;, i.e. running scripts on up/down without a process to supervise (e.g. persist audio volume, keep RNG state)&#8221;, running service directories multiple times, and more. Nitro also maintains its runtime state in RAM and provides an IPC service to query it, meaning it can be run on read-only filesystems without special configuration. There&#8217;s a lot more information in Neukirchen&#8217;s blog post, including a look at some of the current limitations of Nitro. I highly suggest reading it, and perhaps we will see nitro as another valid alternative to the popular systemd.

      <p>
      Asteroid Bennu, sampled by NASA’s OSIRIS-REx mission in 2020, is a mixture of dust that formed in our solar system, organic matter from interstellar space, and pre-solar system stardust. Its unique and varied contents were dramatically transformed over time by interactions with water and exposure to the harsh space environment. These insights come from a trio of newly published papers based on the analysis of Bennu samples by scientists at NASA and other institutions.

      <h1>The “AI” bubble is showing cracks, and Microsoft ruins Excel</h1>

(date: 2025-08-21, from: <a href="https://www.osnews.com/story/143148/the-ai-bubble-is-showing-cracks-and-microsoft-ruins-excel/">OS News</a>)
      <p>
      It&#8217;s not AI winter just yet, though there is a distinct chill in the air. Meta is shaking up and downsizing its artificial intelligence division. A new report out of MIT finds that 95 percent of companies&#8217; generative AI programs have failed to earn any profit whatsoever. Tech stocks tanked Tuesday, regarding broader fears that this bubble may have swelled about as large as it can go. Surely, there will be no wider repercussions for normal people if and when Nvidia, currently propping up the market like a load-bearing matchstick, finally runs out of fake companies to sell chips to. But getting in under the wire, before we&#8217;re all bartering gas in the desert and people who can read become the priestly caste, is Microsoft, with the single most &#8220;Who asked for this?&#8221; application of AI I&#8217;ve seen yet: They&#8217;re jamming it into Excel. ↫ Barry Petchesky at Defector I&#8217;m going to skip over the mounting and palpable uneasiness that the cracks in the &#8220;AI&#8221; bubble are starting to form, and go right to that thing about Excel. Quite possible one of the most successful applications of all time, and the backbone of countless small, medium, and even large business, it started out as a Mac program to supplant Microsoft&#8217;s MultiPlan, which was being clobbered in the market by Lotus 1-2-3. It wasn&#8217;t until version 2.0 that it came to Intel, as an application that contained a Windows runtime. It was a port of Excel 2.0 for the Mac. Anyway, it took a few years, but Excel took over the market, and I don&#8217;t think any other spreadsheet program has ever even remotely threatened its market dominance ever since. Well, not until Google Sheets arrived on the scene &#8211; it&#8217;s hard to find any useful numbers, but it seems Google Sheets is insanely popular in all kinds of sectors, at least according to Statista. They claim Google&#8217;s online office suite has a 49% market share, with Microsoft Office sitting at 29%. I have no idea how that translates into the usage shares of Google Sheets versus Microsoft Excel, but it&#8217;s a sign of the times, regardless. One of the things you&#8217;d expect a spreadsheet to do is calculate numbers and tabulate data, and to do so accurately. The core competency of a computer is to compute, do stuff with numbers, and we&#8217;d flip out collective shit if our computers failed to do such basic arithmetic. So, what if I told you that Microsoft, in its infinite wisdom, has decided to add &#8220;AI&#8221; to Excel, and as such, has to add a disclaimer that this means Excel may not do basic arithmetic correctly? Look, we can all disagree on the use of &#8220;AI&#8221;, where it makes sense, where it doesn&#8217;t, if it even does anything useful, and so on, but I would assume &#8211; for the world&#8217;s sake &#8211; that we can at least agree that using &#8220;AI&#8221; in an application used to do very important calculations for a lot of business is a really, really dumb idea? Is the person doing the bookkeeping in Excel at Windmill Restaurant, in Spearville, Kansas, properly aware of the limitations of &#8220;AI&#8221;, or are they not following technology that closely, and as such only hear the marketing and hype? A spreadsheet should give accurate outcomes based on the input given by humans. The moment you let a confabulator loose on your spreadsheet, it ceases being a tool that can be used for anything even remotely serious. The fact that Microsoft is adding this nonsense to Excel and letting it loose on the unsuspecting public at large is absolutely wild to me, and I can assure you it&#8217;s going to have serious consequences for a lot of people. Microsoft, of course, will be able to point at the disclaimer buried in some random support document and absolve itself of any and all responsibility. I&#8217;d like to point out that Lotus 1-2-3 probably still runs on Windows 11, for no reason at all.
