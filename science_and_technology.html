id="what-were-the-ms-dos-programs-that-the-moricons.dll-icons-were-intended-for">What
were the MS-DOS programs that the moricons.dll icons were intended
for?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-18, from: OS News</p>
<p>Last time, we looked at the legacy icons in progman.exe. But what
about moricons.dll? Here’s a table of the icons that were present in the
original Windows 3.1 moricons.dll file (in file order) and the programs
that Windows used the icons for. As with the icons in progman.exe, these
icons are mapped from executables according to the information in the
APPS.INF file. ↫ Raymond Chen These icons age like a fine wine. They’re
clear, well-designed, easy to read, and make extraordinary good use of
the limited amount of available pixels. Icons from Mac OS, BeOS, OS/2,
and a few others from the same era also look timeless, and I wish modern
designers learned a thing or two from these.</p>
