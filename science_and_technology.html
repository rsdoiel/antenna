<h2 id="whats-new-in-posix-2024-xcu">What’s new in POSIX 2024 – XCU</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-27, from: OS News</p>
<p>As of the previous release of POSIX, the Austin Group gained more
control over the specification, having it be more working group
oriented, and they got to work making the POSIX specification more
modern. POSIX 2024 is the first release that bears the fruits of this
labor, and as such, the changes made to it are particularly interesting,
as they will define the direction of the specification going forwards.
This is what this article is about! Well, mostly. POSIX is composed of a
couple of sections. Notably XBD (Base Definitions, which talk about
things like what a file is, how regular expressions work, etc), XSH
(System Interfaces, the C API that defines POSIX’s internals), and XCU
(which defines the shell command language, and the standard utilities
available for the system). There’s also XRAT, which explains the
rationale of the authors, but it’s less relevant for our purposes today.
XBD and XRAT are both interesting as context for XSH and XCU, but those
are the real meat of the specification. This article will focus on the
XCU section, in particular the utilities part of that section. If you’re
more interested in the XSH section, there’s an excellent summary page
by sortix’s Jonas Termansen that you can read here. ↫ im tosti The
weekend isn’t over yet, so here’s some more light reading.</p>

<h2 id="the-mips-thinkpad-and-the-unreleased-commodore-hhc-4">The MIPS
‘ThinkPad’ and the unreleased Commodore HHC-4</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-27, from: OS News</p>
<p>Old Vintage Computing Research, by the incredibly knowledgeable
Cameron Kaiser, is one of the best resources on the web about genuinely
obscure retrocomputing, often diving quite deep in topics nobody else
covers – or even can cover, considering how rare some of the hardware
Kaiser covers is. I link to Old VCR all the time, and today I’ve got two
more great articles by Kaiser for you. First, we’ve got the more
well-known – relatively speaking – of the two devices covered today, and
that’s the MIPS ThinkPad, officially known as the IBM WorkPad z50. This
was a Windows CE 2.11 device powered by a NEC VR4120 MIPS processor,
running at 131 Mhz, released in 1999. Astute readers might note the
WorkPad branding, which IBM also used for several rebranded Palm Pilots.
Kaiser goes into his usual great detail covering this device, with tons
of photos, and I couldn’t stop reading for a second. There’s so much
good information in here I have no clue what to highlight, but since
OSNews has OS in the name, this section makes sense to focus on: The
desktop shortcuts are pre-populated in ROM along with a whole bunch of
applications. The marquee set that came on H/PC Pro machines was
Microsoft Pocket Office (Pocket Word, Pocket Excel, Pocket Access and
Pocket PowerPoint), Pocket Outlook (Calendar, Contacts, Inbox and Tasks)
and Pocket Internet Explorer, but Microsoft also included Calculator,
InkWriter (not too useful on the z50 without a touch screen), Microsoft
Voice Recorder, World Clock, ActiveSync (a la Palm HotSync), PC Link
(direct connect, not networked), Remote Networking, Terminal (serial
port and modem), Windows Explorer and, of course, Solitaire. IBM
additionally licensed and included some of bSquare’s software suite,
including bFAX Pro for sending and receiving faxes with the softmodem,
bPRINT for printing and bUSEFUL Backup Plus for system backups, along
with a battery calibrator and a Rapid Access quick configuration tool.
There is also a CMD.EXE command shell, though it too is smaller and less
functional than its desktop counterpart. ↫ Old Vintage Computing
Research Using especially these older versions of Windows CE is a wild
experience, because you can clearly tell Microsoft was trying really
hard to make it look and feel like ‘normal’ Windows, but as anyone who
used Windows CE back then can attest, it was a rather poor imitation
with a ton of weird limitations and design decisions borne from the
limited hardware it was designed to run on. I absolutely adore the
various incarnations of Windows CE and associated graphical shells it
ran – especially the PocketPC days – but there’s no denying it always
felt quite clunky. Moving on, the second Old VCR article I’m covering
today is more difficult for me to write about, since I am too young to
have any experience with the 8 bit era – save for some experience with
the MSX platform as a wee child – so I have no affinity for machines
like the Commodore 64 and similar machines from that era. And, well,
this article just so happens to be covering something called the
Commodore HHC-4. Once upon a time (and that time was Winter CES 1983),
Commodore announced what was to be their one and only handheld computer,
the Commodore HHC-4. It was never released and never seen again, at
least not in that form. But it turns out that not only did the HHC-4
actually exist, it also wasn’t manufactured by Commodore — it was a
Toshiba. Like Superman had Clark Kent, the Commodore HHC-4 had a secret
identity too: the Toshiba Pasopia Mini IHC-8000, the very first portable
computer Toshiba ever made. And like Clark Kent was Superman with
glasses, compare the real device to the Commodore marketing photo and
you can see that it’s the very same machine modulo a plastic palette
swap. Of course there’s more to the story than that. ↫ Old Vintage
Computing Research Of course, Kaiser hunted down an IHC-8000, and
details his experiences with the little handheld, calculator-like
machine. It turns out it’s most likely using some unspecified in-house
Toshiba architecture, running at a few hundred kHz, and it’s apparently
quite sluggish. It never made it to market in Commodore livery, most
likely because of its abysmal performance. The amount of work required
to make this little machine more capable and competitive probably
couldn’t be recouped by its intended list price, Kaiser argues.</p>
