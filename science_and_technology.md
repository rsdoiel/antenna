## Banan-OS: a hobby operating system in C++

date: 2024-12-06, from: OS News

This is my hobby operating system written in C++. Currently supports x86_64 and i686 architectures. ↫ Banan-OS git page A hobby operating system as a learning experience, but for once not written in Rust, which in and of itself makes it more unique than you&#8217;d think. Despite being mostly a one-person hobby project, it&#8217;s ticked quite a few boxes already: SMP, network stack, copy-on-write memory, ELF loading, NVME and ATA support, PS/2 and USB peripheral support, a basic GUI, and a lot more.

## HarmonyOS Next gets container tool to run Android applications

date: 2024-12-05, from: OS News

HarmonyOS Next, the new version of Huawei&#8217;s mobile operating system, runs on a brand new microkernel, uses a new, homegrown programming language, and most notably in this duopolistic world, does not run Android applications. This won&#8217;t be much of an issue inside China, where Huawei can more easily make sure the most important Chinese applications are supported and ported over, but outside of China that might pose some problems, especially for Chinese tourists visiting other countries. It turns out there&#8217;s a solution for this, called 出境易 (as Android Authority notes, this seems to translate to something like &#8220;Easy Abroad&#8221;), which is basically a containerised Android runtime using microG. It comes with its own built-in application store filled with a number of popular Android applications, and runs them on HarmonyOS Next. The tool is called 出境易, which roughly translates to “Easy Abroad.” It’s apparently designed to aid Chinese tourists who travel abroad. The tool seems to create a container for Android apps to run in, which is not a new concept but is surprising to see pop up so quickly for the new operating system. When installed, the tool lets you install a number of Android apps from its self-contained app store, including Facebook, Instagram, Discord, Reddit, YouTube, Google Search, Google Maps, Uber, Chrome, Gmail, Spotify, Disney Plus, Netflix, Steam, and more. These Android apps show up in a folder in the home screen but they cannot be dragged out of the folder.  An early hands-on of the tool from YouTuber LL Techview shows that it works surprisingly well. Android apps launch quickly, run pretty smoothly, and even appear in the recents menu. It’s even possible to sign into your Google Account to use apps like Google Search and Gmail. ↫ Mishaal Rahman at Android Authority There are limitations, of course, and they&#8217;re roughly the same as the ones found on any device running microG instead of Google Play Services &#8211; something I just wrote about in my review of /e/OS on a FairPhone 5: certain banking applications won&#8217;t work, anything that hooks too deeply into Play Services won&#8217;t run, that sort of stuff. On top of that, this tool also brings in some limitations of its own, like only whitelisted application being supported, notifications not working properly, and a few other issues. This all feels very similar to what Jolla and Sailfish tried to do way back in 2014. Running Android applications as a side hustle was jank back then and I feel like it&#8217;s probably going to be jank today. Even just running Play Services in a restrictive sandbox &#8211; like I do with GrapheneOS on my daily driver, a Pixel 8 Pro &#8211; presents some issues, and microG adds even more compatibility issues on top. Putting all of this in a container will surely add an additional layer of jank, like it did on Sailfish OS. Regardless, I&#8217;m 100% down with trying to get my hands on a HarmonyOS Next device if they ever become available in some form here in Sweden, as I feel like a review of what is the most serious attempt at breaking the Android-iOS duopoly in over a decade is something that belongs here on OSNews. If that time ever comes, I might set up another fundraiser to get it done.

## Microsoft: we’re not lowering the Windows 11 system requirements

date: 2024-12-04, from: OS News

If you were secretly hoping Microsoft would lower the system requirements for Windows 11 so you could upgrade your or your family&#8217;s Windows 10 machines to Windows 11, you&#8217;re going to be in for some bad news. In a blog post, Microsoft detailed that its most stringent Windows 11 requirement &#8211; the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0 &#8211; is here to stay and crucial to the future of Windows. By instituting TPM 2.0 as a non-negotiable standard for the future of Windows, we elevate the security benchmark. It allows you and us to better align with the growing need for formidable data protection in the modern digital sphere.  In conclusion, TPM 2.0 is not just a recommendation—it’s a necessity for maintaining a secure and future-proof IT environment with Windows 11. And it’s an important part of the larger Zero Trust strategy, alongside Secure Boot, Credential Guard, and Windows Hello for Business. ↫ Steven Hosking at the Windows IT Pro Blog So no, if you had the hope Microsoft would lower Windows 11&#8217;s system requirements in the face of the oncoming end of support deadline for the 60% of Windows users still using Windows 10, your hope has just been dashed. A more likely outcome here is that as the deadline grows closer, Microsoft will extend the deadline by another year, and if needed another, because leaving 60% of users without security updates and little to no path to upgrade is not going to be a good look for the marketing and legal departments. If you really do want to upgrade to Windows 11, there&#8217;s a few options. There&#8217;s the enterprise-focused Windows 11 LTSC 2024 release, which does not require a TPM 2.0, regarding it as an optional feature instead. On top of that, LTSC is much more bare-bones, shipping without much of the stuff many of us more nerdy users aren&#8217;t interested in anyway. The big downside is that getting your hands on a legal copy of LTSC will be difficult, as it&#8217;s only available to volume licensing customers, which you most likely are not. Of course, you shouldn&#8217;t give a shit about Microsoft&#8217;s rules, so you can always use unapproved methods of getting a license. Another option is the one I took for my parts-bin Windows 11 PC which I only use for League of Legends: I bought a cheap TPM 2.0 module from eBay, slotted it into my motherboard, and was on my merry way. Due to League of Legends&#8217; required rootkit, a TPM 2.0 module is needed, so a few euros and days waiting later, I was ready to go. Do make sure you get the right type of TPM 2.0 module for your motherboard, as they&#8217;re not universally compatible. The final option is to use one of the few remaining ways to circumvent Windows 11&#8217;s system requirements, which are sadly dwindling with every major update. Right now that means using a tool like Flyby11, which uses the Windows Server installer to bypass Windows 11&#8217;s system requirements. We&#8217;ll have to wait and see for how long that trick remains possible.

## Convert NTFS to Btrfs and boot Windows off Btrfs

date: 2024-12-03, from: OS News

Ntfs2btrfs is a tool which does in-place conversion of Microsoft&#8217;s NTFS filesystem to the open-source filesystem Btrfs, much as btrfs-convert does for ext2. The original image is saved as a reflink copy at image/ntfs.img, and if you want to keep the conversion you can delete this to free up space. ↫ Mark Harmstone An amazing piece of software that works on both Linux and Windows, and even, as described above, comes with the option of undoing the conversion if you so desire and haven&#8217;t removed the original image yet. Its developer, Mark Harmstone, of course stresses that while he thinks the tool is quite stable, he obviously makes no guarantees or claims about its stability. In other words, please don&#8217;t use this on sensitive data or in a production environment. What makes this tool even more amazing is that you can combine it with two of Harmstone&#8217;s other tools to really pull some rabbits out of your hat. First, there&#8217;s his Btrfs driver for Windows, which, as the name implies, allows Windows to work with Btrfs-formatted drives. Second, and here&#8217;s where things get really spicy, there&#8217;s Quibble, his custom bootloader consisting of open source reimplementations of Windows&#8217; own bootloader. Using these three tools together you can, if you&#8217;re lucky, boot and run Windows off a Btrfs drive. That&#8217;s quite cool, and while perhaps not particularly useful due to its experimental nature, it&#8217;s still an awesome weekend project.

## Intel board kicks out CEO, launches new budget desktop GPUs

date: 2024-12-03, from: OS News

This is a bit of an odd few days for Intel. Mere days after the board ousted its CEO Pat Gelsinger, once heralded as the chip giant&#8217;s messiah, they&#8217;re today launching two brand new desktop graphics cards. They&#8217;re aimed at the more budget-oriented consumer, and might very well be the last discrete graphics cards Intel makes, since this is one of the product lines on the chopping block. Intel’s next — and possibly last — desktop graphics cards will begin arriving in just 10 days.&#160;Right on cue, the company has announced the budget $249 Arc B580 and $219 Arc B570, shipping December 13th and January 16th, respectively, as the “best-in-class performance per dollar” options in the GPU market. They’re based on the same Xe2 “Battlemage” GPU architecture you’ll find in Intel’s Lunar Lake laptop chips but with more than double the graphics cores, up to 12GB of dedicated video memory, and up to 190W of power compared to their limited laptop forms — enough power to see the B580 slightly beat Nvidia’s $299 RTX 4060 and AMD’s $269 RX 7600, according to Intel’s benchmarks, but sometimes still trading blows. ↫ Sean Hollister at The Verge As for Gelsinger&#8217;s dismissal, it seems the board forced him out after being frustrated with the slow progress the company was making in its turnaround. The fact that a finance person and a marketing person will together be interim CEOs seems to indicate the board is more interested in quick profit than a long-term turnaround, and with companies like Qualcomm being interested in acquiring Intel, the board&#8217;s short-term mentality might be winning out, and ousting Gelsinger is just paving the way for selling off parts of Intel until there&#8217;s nothing left. Who knows, I might be reading way too much into all of this, but it feels like expecting an organisation as complex as a high-end processor makers to turn itself around in just a few years is incredibly shortsighted, and you&#8217;d think board members at Intel would understand that. If the goal is to maintain Intel as a separate, profitable entity making some of the world&#8217;s fastest processors, you&#8217;re going to need to give a CEO and leadership team more than just a few years to turn the ship around. Within a few years we&#8217;ll know the board&#8217;s true intentions, but I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised to see Intel being sold for parts over the coming years.

## If not React, then what?

date: 2024-12-02, from: OS News

Rejecting an engrained practice of bullshitting does not come easily. Frameworkism preaches that the way to improve user experiences is to adopt more (or different) tooling from the framework&#8217;s ecosystem. This provides adherents with something to&#160;do&#160;that looks plausibly like engineering, except it isn&#8217;t. It can even become a totalising commitment; solutions to user problems outside the framework&#8217;s expanded cinematic universe are unavailable to the frameworkist. Non-idiomatic patterns that unlock significant wins for users are bugs to be squashed. And without data or evidence to counterbalance bullshit artists&#8217;s assertions, who&#8217;s to say they&#8217;re wrong? Orthodoxy unmoored from measurements of user outcomes predictably spins into&#160;abstruse absurdities.&#160;Heresy, eventually, is perceived to carry heavy sanctions. It&#8217;s all nonsense. ↫ Alex Russell I&#8217;m not a developer, but any application that uses frameworks like React that I&#8217;ve ever used tend to be absolute trainwrecks when it comes to performance, usability, consistency, and platform integration. When someone claims to have an application available for a platform I use, but it&#8217;s using React or Electron or whatever, they&#8217;re lying in my eyes &#8211; what they really have is a website running in a window frame, which may or may not even be a native window frame. Developing using these tools indicates to me a lack of care, a lack of respect for the users of your product. I am militantly native. I&#8217;d rather use a less functional application than a Chrome web application cosplaying as a real application, and I will most likely not even consider using your service if all you have is a website-in-a-box. If you don&#8217;t respect me, I see no need to respect you. If you want an application on a specific platform, use that platform&#8217;s native tools and APIs to build it. Anything else tells me all I need to know about how much you truly care about the product you&#8217;re building.

## The Hall SC-VGA-2 video processor, the Atari ST and NeXTSTEP: more tales of the unscreenshotable

date: 2024-12-02, from: OS News

This is the Hall Research Technologies SC-VGA-2, sold as a &#8220;VGA/HDTV Video Processor.&#8221; In addition to slicing, dicing and pureeing, apparently, it will take any of a bundle of input formats and both rescale and resample them on the fly into the VGA or HDTV signal you desire, including 60Hz rates. This came from a seller specializing in teleprompter equipment and Hall still sells an HDMI version with additional resolutions &#8230; for around US$500. However, this or the slightly newer SC-VGA-2A and SC-VGA-2B are all relatively common devices and found substantially cheaper used. Let&#8217;s try it out and show some sample output, including those delicious NeXTSTEP system messages and some ST grabs. ↫ Cameron Kaiser With the obscurity of some of the hardware Cameron Kaiser details on his website, I&#8217;m not surprised he has some seriously unique needs when it comes to taking screengrabs. He couldn&#8217;t very well not take the device apart, and inside it appears to be a system with two small processors, at least one of which is an Intel 8051 8bit microcontroller. Kaiser goes into his usual great detail explaining and showing how the device works. If you&#8217;ve got unique screengrabbing needs, this might be of interest to you.
