## Windows Server IoT 2025 released

date: 2024-11-05, from: OS News

Today, Microsoft announced the general availability of Windows Server IoT 2025. This new release includes several improvements, including advanced multilayer security, hybrid cloud agility, AI, performance enhancements, and more. Microsoft claims that Windows Server IoT 2025 will be able to handle the most demanding workloads, including AI and machine learning. It now has built-in support for GPU partitioning and the ability to process large datasets across distributed environments. With Live Migration and High Availability, it also offers a high-performance platform for both traditional applications and advanced AI workloads. ↫ Pradeep Viswanathan at Neowin Windows Server IoT 2025 brings the same benefits, new features, and improvements as the just-released regular Windows Server 2025. I must admit I&#8217;m a little unclear as to what Windows Server IoT has to offer over the regular edition, and reading the various Microsoft marketing materials and documents don&#8217;t really make it any clearer for me either, since I&#8217;m not particularly well-versed in all that enterprise networking lingo.

## NetBSD: the portable, lightweight, and robust UNIX-like operating system

date: 2024-11-04, from: OS News

NetBSD is an open-source, Unix-like operating system known for its portability, lightweight design, and robustness across a wide array of hardware platforms. Initially released in 1993, NetBSD was one of the first open-source operating systems based on the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) lineage, alongside FreeBSD and OpenBSD. NetBSD’s development has been led by a collaborative community and is particularly recognized for its “clean” and well-documented codebase, a factor that has made it a popular choice among users interested in systems programming and cross-platform compatibility. ↫ André Machado I&#8217;m not really sure what to make of this article, since it mostly reads like an advertisement for NetBSD, but considering NetBSD is one of the lesser-talked about variants of an operating system family that already sadly plays second fiddle to the Linux behemoth, I don&#8217;t think giving it some additional attention is really hurting anybody. The article is still gives a solid overview of the history and strengths of NetBSD, which makes it a good introduction. I have personally never tried NetBSD, but it&#8217;s on my list of systems to try out on my PA-RISC workstation since from what I&#8217;ve heard it&#8217;s the only BSD which can possibly load up X11 on the Visualize FX10pro graphics card it has (OpenBSD can only boot to a console on this GPU). While I could probably coax some cobbled-together Linux installation into booting X11 on it, where&#8217;s the fun in that? Do any of you lovely readers use NetBSD for anything? FreeBSD and even OpenBSD are quite well represented as general purpose operating systems in the kinds of circles we all frequent, but I rarely hear about people using NetBSD other than explicitly because it supports some outdated, arcane architecture in 2024.

## Redox runs on RISC-V, boots to GUI login on Raspberry Pi 4

date: 2024-11-04, from: OS News

Another month lies behind us, so another monthly update from Redox is upon us. The biggest piece of news this time is undoubtedly that Redox now runs on RISC-V &#8211; a major achievement. Andrey Turkin has done extensive work on RISC-V support in the kernel, toolchain and elsewhere. Thanks very much Andrey for the excellent work! Jeremy Soller has incorporated RISC-V support into the toolchain and build process, has begun some refactoring of the kernel and device drivers to better handle all the supported architectures, and has gotten the Orbital Desktop working when running in QEMU. ↫ Ribbon and Ron Williams That&#8217;s not all, though. Redox on the Raspberry Pi 4 boots to the GUI login screen, but needs more work on especially USB support to become a fully usable target. The application store from the COSMIC desktop environment has been ported, and as part of this effort, Redox also adopted FreeDesktop standards to make package installation easier &#8211; and it just makes sense to do so, with more and more of COSMIC making its way to Redox. Of course, there&#8217;s also a slew of smaller improvements to the kernel, various drivers including the ACPI driver, RedoxFS, Relibc, and a lot more. The progress Redox is making is astounding, and while that&#8217;s partly because it&#8217;s easier to make progress when there&#8217;s a lot of low-hanging fruit as there inevitably will be in a relatively new operating system, it&#8217;s still quite an achievement. I feel very positive about the future of Redox, and I can&#8217;t wait until it reaches a point where more general purpose use becomes viable.

## Windows Server 2025 released

date: 2024-11-04, from: OS News

Microsoft has confirmed the general availability of Windows Server 2025, which, as a long-term servicing channel (LTSC) release, will be supported for almost ten years. This article describes some of the newest developments in Windows Server 2025, which boasts advanced features that improve security, performance, and flexibility. With faster storage options and the ability to integrate with hybrid cloud environments, managing your infrastructure is now more streamlined. Windows Server 2025 builds on the strong foundation of its predecessor while introducing a range of innovative enhancements to adapt to your needs. ↫ What&#8217;s new in Windows Server 2025 article It should come as no surprise that Windows Server 2025 comes loaded with a ton of new features and improvements. I already covered some of those, such as DTrace by default, NVMe and storage improvements, hotpatching, and more. Other new features we haven&#8217;t discussed yet are a massive list of changes and improvements to Active Directory, a feature-on-demand feature for Azure Arc, support for Bluetooth keyboards, mice, and other peripherals, and tons of Hyper-V improvements. SMB is also seeing so many improvements it&#8217;s hard to pick just a few to highlight, and software-defined networking is also touted as a major aspect of Server 2025. With SDN you can separate the network control plane from the data plane, giving administrators more flexibility in managing their network. I can just keep going listing all of the changes, but you get the idea &#8211; there&#8217;s a lot here. You can try Windows Server 2025 for free for 180 days, as a VM in Azure, a local virtual machine image, or installed locally through an ISO image.

## Moving a game project from C to the Odin language

date: 2024-11-04, from: OS News

Some months ago, I got really fed up with C. Like, I don&#8217;t&#160;hate&#160;C. Hating programming languages is silly. But it was way too much effort to do simple things like lists/hashmaps and other simple data structures and such. I decided to try this language called&#160;Odin, which is one of these &#8220;Better C&#8221; languages. And I ended up liking it&#160;so much&#160;that I moved my game&#160;Artificial Rage&#160;from C to Odin. Since Odin has support for Raylib too (like everything really), it was very easy to move things around. Here&#8217;s how it all went.. Well, what I remember the very least. ↫ Akseli Lahtinen You programmers might&#8217;ve thought you escaped the wrath of Monday on OSNews, but after putting the IT administrators to work in my previous post, it&#8217;s now time for you to get to work. If you have a C codebase and want to move it to something else, in this case Odin, Lahtinen&#8217;s article will send you on your way. As someone who barely knows how to write HTML, it&#8217;s difficult for me to say anything meaningful about the technical details, but I feel like there&#8217;s a lot of useful, first-hand info here.

## From Proxmox to FreeBSD: story of a migration

date: 2024-11-04, from: OS News

It&#8217;s the start of the work week, so for the IT administrators among us, I have another great article by friend of the website, Stefano Marinelli. This article covers migrating a Proxmox-based setup to FreeBSD with bhyve. The load is not particularly high, and the machines have good performance. Suddenly, however, I received a notification: one of the NVMe drives died abruptly, and the server rebooted. ZFS did its job, and everything remained sufficiently secure, but since it’s a leased server and already several years old, I spoke with the client and proposed getting more recent hardware and redoing the setup based on a FreeBSD host. ↫ Stefano Marinelli If you&#8217;re interested in moving one of your own setups, or one of your clients&#8217; setups, from Linux to FreeBSD, this is a great place to start and get some ideas, tips, and tricks. Like I said, it&#8217;s Monday, and you need to get to work.

## OSNews fundraising goal reached in less than a week

date: 2024-11-03, from: OS News

It&#8217;s been less than a week, and late Friday night we reached the fundraiser goal of €2500 (it sat at 102% when I closed it) on Ko-Fi! I&#8217;m incredibly grateful for each and every donation, big or small, and every new Patreon that joined our ranks. It&#8217;s incredible how many of you are willing to support OSNews to keep it going, and it means the absolute world to me. Hopefully we&#8217;ll eventually reach a point where monthly Patreon income is high enough so we can turn off ads for everyone, and be fully free from any outside dependencies. Of course, it&#8217;s not just those that choose to support us financially &#8211; every reader matters, and I&#8217;m very thankful for each and every one of you, donor/Patreon or not. The weekend&#8217;s almost over, so back to regular posting business tomorrow. I wish y&#8217;all an awesome Sunday evening.

## That position you just applied for might be a 'ghost job' that'll never be filled

date: 2024-11-03, updated: 2024-11-03, from: The Register (UK I.T. News)

<h4>Turns out it&#39;s perfectly legal to waste applicants&#39; time, use posts to squeeze more productivity out of employees</h4> <p>If you didn&#39;t hear back about that great-looking tech position you applied for, it might not be because there were too many applicants scrambling to find a job amid rolling layoffs. There&#39;s a distinct possibility the posting was fake to begin with.…</p>
