## Kyvos: GUI frontend for easy AmigaOS 4 and MorphOS emulation using Qemu

date: 2025-07-31, from: OS News

Getting hardware to run AmigaOS 4.1 or MorphOS on isn&#8217;t always easy, cheap, or even possible in the first place. Luckily, there&#8217;s now an incredibly easy and straightforward way to emulate these two operating systems: Kyvos, developed by George Sokianos. Kyvos is a user-friendly frontend for Qemu, designed to streamline the creation of AmigaOS 4 and MorphOS emulated environments on Linux, macOS, and Windows. Pronounced &#8220;kee-vos,&#8221; this name is inspired by the Greek word &#8220;κύβος,&#8221; meaning cube, symbolizing these virtual systems running within the host OS. Setting up an AmigaOS 4 or MorphOS system is effortless with Kyvos—just a few clicks, and you&#8217;re ready to go. A helpful wizard guides users in locating or downloading necessary dependencies, including Qemu and 7zip binaries. ↫ George Sokianos Of course, nothing is stopping you from following guides online to build your own Qemu virtual machine and associated complex command to start it, but Kyvos takes all that work out of your hands and makes it incredibly easy, all wrapped in a nice graphical user interface. It&#8217;s available for Linux, Windows, and macOS. All you need is Kyvos &#8211; which is free, but Ko-Fi donations are appreciated &#8211; and a copy of either AmigaOS 4.1 Final Edition or MorphOS. Based on a toot by Hyperion, the developers of AmigaOS 4.1, you need the version for the AmigaOne board specifically, which will set you back about €30 for a boxed copy (I&#8217;ve asked if there are any download versions for sale as well). A copy of MorphOS costs about €79, and can be bought from inside MorphOS after installation. Note that you can also use MorphOS without a license, but it will slow down its performance after about 30 minutes until you reboot. I&#8217;m stoked to try this out, as I&#8217;ve been wanting to review both of these operating systems again, since my previous reviews of Amiga OS 4 (from 2009) and MorphOS (also from 2009) are horribly outdated at this point. MorphOS on old Apple PowerPC hardware just doesn&#8217;t cut it &#8211; believe me, I&#8217;ve tried &#8211; and AmigaOS 4 hardware is quite expensive and outdated at this point. Until &#8211; and let&#8217;s face it, if &#8211; the Mirari comes out, easy emulation through Qemu might be an option.

## NVIDIA extends Windows 10 support for RTX GPUs by one year

date: 2025-07-31, from: OS News

Stuck at the bottom of NVIDIA&#8217;s announcement of its latest graphics driver update is a section about the company&#8217;s plan for Windows 10 support. As we all know, Windows 10 will become end-of-life in October of this year, and like so many others, NVIDIA needs to deal with this. Before we get to Windows 10, though, NVIDIA also reminds users that a few very popular GPU generations will no longer receive driver updates after October of this year. The company notes that GPUs based on the Maxwell, Pascal, and Volta architectures will Game Ready Driver in October 2025, after which they&#8217;ll only get quarterly security updates for another three years. These three architectures roughly correspond to the GeForce GTX 7xx, 9xx, and 10xx series and their mobile counterparts, as well as a few other higher-end cards from the same generations. The full list is available to see if your GPU will receive its last driver update in a few months. As for Windows 10 support, the company notes: Also, we’re extending Windows 10 Game Ready Driver support for all GeForce RTX GPUs to October 2026, a year beyond the operating system’s end-of-life, to ensure users continue to receive the latest day-0 optimizations for new games and apps. ↫ Andrew Burnes at nvidia.com Considering half of Windows users are still using Windows 10, this is probably the correct policy by NVIDIA. Ideally this support would last even longer than just that one year, but with a company like NVIDIA you kind of have to take what you can get, because generous they are not.

## Vivo’s BlueOS: written in Rust, similar to HarmonyOS?

date: 2025-07-30, from: OS News

BlueOS kernel is written in Rust, featuring security, lightweight, and generality. It is compatible with POSIX interfaces and supports Rust&#8217;s standard library. ↫ BlueOS kernel GitHub page This is the kernel for the BlueOS operating system, developed by Vivo, a Chinese consumer electronics company. Sadly, all of the websites and documentation for BlueOS are written in Mandarin, making it virtually impossible to really get a grip on what they&#8217;re developing, and I certainly don&#8217;t trust Google Translate or whatever enough to give me a proper, trustworthy, and accurate translation. I hope the company either hires some translators, or perhaps enthusiasts with the right skillset can provide some more insight over the coming years. It seems similar to Huawei&#8217;s HarmonyOS Next, and it&#8217;s apparently shipping on one of Vivo&#8217;s smartwatches.

## Why are you (still) using OpenBSD?

date: 2025-07-30, from: OS News

Last week-end, I was invited to the UNIX Social Camp in Dijon, France to talk about the reasons I still use OpenBSD these days and why should others do so; or at least, have a look at OpenBSD. ↫ Joel Carnat Here&#8217;s my short pitch as to why you should use OpenBSD: it&#8217;s the closest you&#8217;ll get to a traditional, classic UNIX, while still using a modern and maintained operating system. OpenBSD just makes sense, and every time I run into some issue or I want to know how something in OpenBSD works, the answers always make me go &#8220;well that makes sense&#8221;. That&#8217;s rare in modern computing, and we need to cherish it.

## Microsoft clicks their heels once more, allows hate-speech on LinkedIn

date: 2025-07-30, from: OS News

Are you still using LinkedIn, the website where failed tech startup entrepreneurs go to die and &#8220;AI&#8221; influencers try to sell you on the latest version of the chatbot Florpium like a Utah mom trying to sell leggings that are totally not an MLM? If you are, and the other ten thousand reasons not to use the website incarnation of an ad for a personal injury lawyer along I-11 in Henderson, Nevada, weren&#8217;t enough, Microsoft just handed you another one. LinkedIn removed transgender-related protections from its policy on hateful and derogatory content. The platform no longer lists “misgendering or deadnaming of transgender individuals” as examples of prohibited conduct. While “content that attacks, denigrates, intimidates, dehumanizes, incites or threatens hatred, violence, prejudicial or discriminatory action” is still considered hateful, addressing a person by a gender and name they ask not be designated by is not anymore. Similarly, the platform removed “race or gender identity” from its examples of inherent traits for which negative comments are considered harassment. That qualification of harassment is now kept only for behaviour that is actively “disparaging another member’s  perceived gender”, not mentioning race or gender identity anymore. ↫ Matti Schneider at the Open Terms Archive Microsoft joined the chorus of pathetic, spineless US tech companies bowing to far-right extremism long ago, and this is just another sign that Microsoft, like so many other US tech companies, is pulling an IBM. They did learn from the best, after all, and it doesn&#8217;t surprise me one bit that all of these CEOs click their heels like the good little brownshirts that they are. Anyway, LinkedIn has no value to anyone with even a gram of self-respect, and Microsoft&#8217;s other products are such utter trash they basically have to make you upgrade at the barrel of a gun. For those using their products &#8211; do you hate yourself that much? You deserve so much more.

## OpenBSD gets CDE

date: 2025-07-30, from: OS News

Adjusted for the inevitable progress of time, the Common Desktop Environment or CDE is the best desktop environment of all time, and no, I will not be taking question at this time. OpenBSD wasn&#8217;t yet graced by CDE&#8217;s presence, but this is currently changing as the first commit for porting CDE to OpenBSD has appeared. It&#8217;s still rough around the edges and very slightly tested. I wouldn&#8217;t use is as a daily driver, it&#8217;s old unsecure code but it&#8217;s fun if you want to bring back memories. ↫ Antoine at the openbsd-ports mailing list On top of that, this being the initial commit also means there&#8217;s probably bugs and other issues lurking in the code, so caution is definitely advised.

## Microsoft finally standardises CPU usage reporting in Task Manager

date: 2025-07-30, from: OS News

Microsoft is finally changing the way Task Manager reports CPU utilisation to make it consistent across the different tabs. So apparently this has been gradually rolling out to the 34 different Windows 11 beta dev preview testing alpha release candidate service pack 4 channels since early this year, but then stopped the roll-out to fix some issues. These issues seem fixed now, as the roll-out restarted this week. It&#8221;s an important change that I think y&#8217;all will care about. From the original announcement of the change back in February: We are beginning to roll out a change to the way Task Manager calculates CPU utilization for the Processes, Performance, and Users pages. Task Manager will now use the standard metrics to display CPU workload consistently across all pages and aligning with industry standards and third-party tools. For backward compatibility, a new optional column called CPU Utility is available (hidden by default) on the Details tab showing the previous CPU value used on the Processes page. ↫ Amanda Langowski and Brandon LeBlanc at the Windows Blogs Before this change, Task Manager&#8217;s Processes tab didn&#8217;t take the number of processor cores into account when calculating PCU usage, so you could see a process at 100% CPU usage even if it was only using one core. These new changes standardise CPU usage reporting across all tabs, taking the number of CPU cores into account properly. Rejoice.

## Why RISC-V Linux needs everyone upstream

date: 2025-07-30, from: OS News

RISC-V has been supported in the upstream Linux kernel since 2017. But without a common hardware baseline, ensuring compatibility across builds and distros hasn’t been easy. The ecosystem was in need of a compelling, clearly defined hardware target – something both software and hardware teams could rally around to produce silicon capable of running stable, enterprise-grade software. This target arrived in October 2024 with the ratification of the application-class RVA23 Profile – RISC-V-speak for a baseline configuration, similar to microarchitecture feature levels in x86. The culmination of years of progress, RVA23 brings together the work done to shape the ISA and standardize key extensions such as vector, bit manipulation and hypervisor. ↫ James De Vile at RISC-V International&#8217;s blog Such a standard, stable baseline is incredibly welcome, and RISC-V working to have everything part of the upstream Linux kernel is crucial. Having to deal with out-of-tree patches and drivers and specific builds for specific boards is a nightmare &#8211; look at Linux on ARM &#8211; and hinders adoption of RISC-V.

## The EU’s age-verification application requires a Google or Apple account and Google-approved Android device or iPhone

date: 2025-07-28, from: OS News

The European Union is in the process of testing an age-verification application, which people can use to verify their age in a privacy-preserving manner (in theory, of course). There&#8217;s countless important discussions to be had about whether or not age verification, privacy-preserving or not, is even something we should want, but that&#8217;s a topic for another time and for people smarter than I. For now, several member states are currently testing the application on a voluntary basis, and the application itself is open source, with the code hosted on GitHub. Aside from the obvious concerns about just how private such an application can even be, and concerns about whether or not we should even want something like this, there&#8217;s another major problem: the application intends to make use of and require application and device verification by using the proprietary tools for such functionality from Google and Apple, built into Android and iOS, respectively. Listed as future &#8220;features&#8221;: App and device verification based on Google Play Integrity API and Apple App Attestation ↫ The application&#8217;s GitHub page This is a massive problem. For reasons that should be obvious to anyone with at least six functioning neurons, the European Union, as well as countless other countries, are trying to reduce their dependency on US technology companies. As such, it&#8217;s indefensible to then require anyone who needs to use age verification in the European Union to use an application that will only work on Google-approved Android devices and even then, only when installed from the Google Play Store, with the only alternative being, of all things, Apple&#8217;s iOS. This means that the EU will require anyone who needs age verification to have either a Google or an Apple account, and can only use Google-approved Android or iOS. This application would not work on, say, GrapheneOS or any other non-Google-approved Android ROM &#8211; in fact, even if you were to compile the application yourself, you wouldn&#8217;t be able to actually use it because it wouldn&#8217;t be installed from the Google Play Store. Of course, any mobile operating other than Android or iOS need not apply either. The danger of tying age verification to Google and Apple did not go by unnoticed, and a GitHub issue raised the issue a few weeks ago. I would like to strongly urge to abandon this plan. Requiring a dependency on American tech giants for age verification further deepens the EU&#8217;s dependency on America and the USA&#8217;s control over the internet. Especially in the current political climate I hope I do not have to explain how undesirable and dangerous that is. ↫ TheLastProject in the GitHub issue The comment thread attached to the issue is long, but during the two weeks since the issue was raised, nobody from the application&#8217;s team has answered or even acknowledged people&#8217;s concerns, which doesn&#8217;t exactly inspire confidence in this being taken seriously. I just hope that with this entire project being in the early testing phases, at least someone manages to realise tying this to Google and Apple is one of the dumbest ideas in a long, long time.

## Samsung removes bootloader unlocking with One UI 8

date: 2025-07-28, from: OS News

Have a Samsung phone (outside of the United States), and want to unlock the bootloader? Well, soon you won&#8217;t be able to do so anymore, as Samsung seems to be removing this option from their phones &#8211; including already sold models being upgraded to One UI 8. Bootloader unlocking is a popular way to breathe new life into older devices, by loading unofficial software onto a device, like custom ROMs, gaining root access, custom kernels, etc. This option will be taken away from users with One UI 8.  This means not only is the OEM Unlock not visible in Settings anymore, but the bootloader doesn’t even contain any of the code required to unlock itself. This means a workaround to brute force it open is not possible at all, unless Samsung updates the bootloader to add this logic back in. ↫ Josh Skinner at SammyGuru And so, the ongoing process of locking down Android to a point where it becomes nigh-on indistinguishable from iOS&#8217; locked-down, anti-user nature continues unabated. Samsung is the default choice for Android users in a lot of places around the world, and seeing them, too move ever closer to fully locking down their phones is terrible news for consumers. We should be striving for less restrictive computing, not more. Combined with persistent rumours that Google is looking into effectively taking Android closed source, leaving only a stub AOSP behind, the future of Android as an least somewhat &#8220;open&#8221; platform looks quite grim indeed.
