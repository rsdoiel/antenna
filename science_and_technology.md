## Windows Server 2025 released

date: 2024-11-04, from: OS News

Microsoft has confirmed the general availability of Windows Server 2025, which, as a long-term servicing channel (LTSC) release, will be supported for almost ten years. This article describes some of the newest developments in Windows Server 2025, which boasts advanced features that improve security, performance, and flexibility. With faster storage options and the ability to integrate with hybrid cloud environments, managing your infrastructure is now more streamlined. Windows Server 2025 builds on the strong foundation of its predecessor while introducing a range of innovative enhancements to adapt to your needs. ↫ What&#8217;s new in Windows Server 2025 article It should come as no surprise that Windows Server 2025 comes loaded with a ton of new features and improvements. I already covered some of those, such as DTrace by default, NVMe and storage improvements, hotpatching, and more. Other new features we haven&#8217;t discussed yet are a massive list of changes and improvements to Active Directory, a feature-on-demand feature for Azure Arc, support for Bluetooth keyboards, mice, and other peripherals, and tons of Hyper-V improvements. SMB is also seeing so many improvements it&#8217;s hard to pick just a few to highlight, and software-defined networking is also touted as a major aspect of Server 2025. With SDN you can separate the network control plane from the data plane, giving administrators more flexibility in managing their network. I can just keep going listing all of the changes, but you get the idea &#8211; there&#8217;s a lot here. You can try Windows Server 2025 for free for 180 days, as a VM in Azure, a local virtual machine image, or installed locally through an ISO image.

## Moving a game project from C to the Odin language

date: 2024-11-04, from: OS News

Some months ago, I got really fed up with C. Like, I don&#8217;t&#160;hate&#160;C. Hating programming languages is silly. But it was way too much effort to do simple things like lists/hashmaps and other simple data structures and such. I decided to try this language called&#160;Odin, which is one of these &#8220;Better C&#8221; languages. And I ended up liking it&#160;so much&#160;that I moved my game&#160;Artificial Rage&#160;from C to Odin. Since Odin has support for Raylib too (like everything really), it was very easy to move things around. Here&#8217;s how it all went.. Well, what I remember the very least. ↫ Akseli Lahtinen You programmers might&#8217;ve thought you escaped the wrath of Monday on OSNews, but after putting the IT administrators to work in my previous post, it&#8217;s now time for you to get to work. If you have a C codebase and want to move it to something else, in this case Odin, Lahtinen&#8217;s article will send you on your way. As someone who barely knows how to write HTML, it&#8217;s difficult for me to say anything meaningful about the technical details, but I feel like there&#8217;s a lot of useful, first-hand info here.

## From Proxmox to FreeBSD: story of a migration

date: 2024-11-04, from: OS News

It&#8217;s the start of the work week, so for the IT administrators among us, I have another great article by friend of the website, Stefano Marinelli. This article covers migrating a Proxmox-based setup to FreeBSD with bhyve. The load is not particularly high, and the machines have good performance. Suddenly, however, I received a notification: one of the NVMe drives died abruptly, and the server rebooted. ZFS did its job, and everything remained sufficiently secure, but since it’s a leased server and already several years old, I spoke with the client and proposed getting more recent hardware and redoing the setup based on a FreeBSD host. ↫ Stefano Marinelli If you&#8217;re interested in moving one of your own setups, or one of your clients&#8217; setups, from Linux to FreeBSD, this is a great place to start and get some ideas, tips, and tricks. Like I said, it&#8217;s Monday, and you need to get to work.

## Amazon's nuclear datacenter dreams stall as regulators reject power deal

## Public sector cyber break-ins: Our money, our lives, our right to know

date: 2024-11-04, updated: 2024-11-04, from: The Register (UK I.T. News)

<h4>Is that a walrus in your server logs, or aren&#39;t you pleased to see me?</h4> <p><strong>Opinion</strong>  At the start of September, Transport for London was hit by a major cyber attack. TfL is the public body that moves many of London&#39;s human bodies to and from work and play in the capital, and as the attack didn&#39;t hit power, signaling, or communications systems, most of the effects went unnoticed by commuters. The organization downplayed the damage done to back office ticketing, billing, and other systems. Everything was in hand.…</p>

## OSNews fundraising goal reached in less than a week

date: 2024-11-03, from: OS News

It&#8217;s been less than a week, and late Friday night we reached the fundraiser goal of €2500 (it sat at 102% when I closed it) on Ko-Fi! I&#8217;m incredibly grateful for each and every donation, big or small, and every new Patreon that joined our ranks. It&#8217;s incredible how many of you are willing to support OSNews to keep it going, and it means the absolute world to me. Hopefully we&#8217;ll eventually reach a point where monthly Patreon income is high enough so we can turn off ads for everyone, and be fully free from any outside dependencies. Of course, it&#8217;s not just those that choose to support us financially &#8211; every reader matters, and I&#8217;m very thankful for each and every one of you, donor/Patreon or not. The weekend&#8217;s almost over, so back to regular posting business tomorrow. I wish y&#8217;all an awesome Sunday evening.

## That position you just applied for might be a 'ghost job' that'll never be filled
