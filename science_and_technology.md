## Pairs not taken

date: 2025-01-08, from: OS News

So we all know about twisted-pair ethernet, huh? I get a little frustrated with a lot of histories of the topic, like the recent neil breen^w^wserial port video, because they often fail to address some obvious questions about the origin of twisted-pair network cabling. Well, I will fail to answer these as well, because the reality is that these answers have proven very difficult to track down. ↫ J. B. Crawford The problems with nailing down an accurate history of the development of the various standards, ideas, concepts, and implementations of Ethernet and other, by now dead, network standards are their age, as well as the fact that their history is entangled with the even longer history of telephone wiring. The reasoning behind some of the choices made by engineers over the past more than 100 years of telephone technology aren&#8217;t always clear, and very difficult to retrace. Crawford dives into some seriously old and fun history here, trying to piece together the origins of twisted pair the best he can. It&#8217;s a great read, as all of his writings are.

## An operating system in 1000 lines

date: 2025-01-08, from: OS News

Hey there! In this book, we&#8217;re going to build a small operating system from scratch, step by step. You might get intimidated when you hear OS or kernel development, the basic functions of an OS (especially the kernel) are surprisingly simple. Even Linux, which is often cited as a huge open-source software, was only 8,413 lines in version 0.01. Today&#8217;s Linux kernel is overwhelmingly large, but it started with a tiny codebase, just like your hobby project. We&#8217;ll implement basic context switching, paging, user mode, a command-line shell, a disk device driver, and file read/write operations in C. Sounds like a lot, however, it&#8217;s only 1,000 lines of code! ↫ Seiya Nuta It&#8217;s exactly what it says on the tin.

## HDMI 2.2 will require new “Ultra96” cables, whenever we have 8K TVs and content

date: 2025-01-07, from: OS News

We&#8217;ve all had a good seven years to figure out why our interconnected devices refused to work properly with the HDMI 2.1 specification. The HDMI Forum announced at CES today that it&#8217;s time to start considering new headaches. HDMI 2.2 will require new cables for full compatibility, but it has the same physical connectors. Tiny QR codes are suggested to help with that, however. The new specification is named HDMI 2.2, but compatible cables will carry an &#8220;Ultra96&#8221; marker to indicate that they can carry 96GBps, double the 48 of HDMI 2.1b. The Forum anticipates this will result in higher resolutions and refresh rates and a &#8220;next-gen HDMI Fixed Rate Link.&#8221; The Forum cited &#8220;AR/VR/MR, spatial reality, and light field displays&#8221; as benefiting from increased bandwidth, along with medical imaging and machine vision. ↫ Kevin Purdey at Ars Technica I&#8217;m sure this will not pose any problems whatsoever, and that no shady no-name manufacturers will abuse this situation at all.

## NESFab: a new programming language for creating NES games

date: 2025-01-07, from: OS News

NESFab is a new programming language for creating NES games. Designed with 8-bit limitations in mind, the language is more ergonomic to use than C, while also producing faster assembly code. It&#8217;s easy to get started with, and has a useful set of libraries for making your first — or hundredth — NES game. ↫ NESFab website NESFab has some smart features developers of NES games will certainly appreciate, most notably automatic bank switching. Instead of doing this manually, but NESFab will automatically carve your code and data up into banks to be switched in and out of memory when needed. There&#8217;s also an optional map editor, which makes it very easy to create additional levels for your game. All in all, a very cool project I hadn&#8217;t heard of, which also claims to perform better than other compilers. If you&#8217;ve ever considered making an NES game, NESFab might be a tool to consider.

## Dell rebrands its entire product line: XPS, Inspiron, Latitude, etc. are going away

date: 2025-01-06, from: OS News

Dell has announced it&#8217;s rebranding literally its entire product line, so mainstays like XPS, Latitude, and Inspiron are going away. They&#8217;re replacing all of these old brands with Dell, Dell Pro, and Dell Pro Max, and within each of these, there will be three tiers: Base, Plus, and Premium. Of course, the reason is &#8220;AI&#8221;. The AI PC market is quickly evolving. Silicon innovation is at its strongest and everyone from IT decision makers to professionals and everyday users are looking at on-device AI to help drive productivity and creativity. To make finding the right AI PC easy for customers, we’ve introduced three simple product categories to focus on core customer needs – Dell (designed for play, school and work), Dell Pro (designed for professional-grade productivity) and Dell Pro Max (designed for maximum performance).  We’ve also made it easy to distinguish products within each of the new product categories. We have a consistent approach to tiering that lets customers pinpoint the exact device for their specific needs. Above and beyond the starting point (Base), there’s a Plus tier that offers the most scalable performance and a Premium tier that delivers the ultimate in mobility and design. ↫ Kevin Terwilliger on Dell&#8217;s blog Setting aside the nonsensical reasoning behind the rebrand, I do actually kind of dig the simplicity here. This is a simple, straightforward set of brand names and tiers that pretty much anyone can understand. That being said, the issue with Dell in particular is that once you go to their website to actually buy one of their machines, the clarity abruptly ends and it gets confusing fast. I hope these new brand names and tiers will untangle some of that mess to make it easier to find what you need, but I&#8217;m skeptical. My XPS 13 from 2017 is really starting to show its age, and considering how happy I&#8217;ve been with it over the years its current Dell equivalent would be a top contender (assuming I had the finances to do so). I wonder if the Linux support on current Dell laptops has improved since my XPS 13 was new?

## Microsoft’s tone-deaf advice to Windows 10 users: just buy a new PC, you’re all rich, right?

date: 2025-01-06, from: OS News

Over 60% of Windows users are still using Windows 10, with only about 35% or so &#8211; and falling! &#8211; of them opting to use Windows 11. As we&#8217;ve talked about many times before, this is a major issue going into 2025, since Windows 10&#8217;s support will end in October of this year, meaning hundreds of millions of people all over the world will suddenly be running an operating system that will no longer receive security updates. Most of those people don&#8217;t want to, or cannot, upgrade to Windows 11, meaning Microsoft is leaving 60% of its Windows customer base out to dry. I&#8217;m sure this will go down just fine with regulators and governments the world over. Microsoft has tried everything, and it&#8217;s clear desperation is setting in, because the company just declared 2025 &#8220;The year of the Windows 11 PC refresh&#8221;, stating that Windows 11 is the best way to get all the &#8220;AI&#8221; stuff people are clearly clamoring for. All of the innovation arriving on new Windows 11 PCs is coming at an important time. We recently confirmed that after providing 10 years of updates and support, Windows 10 will reach the end of its lifecycle on Oct. 14, 2025. After this date, Windows 10 PCs will no longer receive security or feature updates, and our focus is on helping customers stay protected by moving to modern new PCs running Windows 11. Whether the current PC needs a refresh, or it has security vulnerabilities that require the latest hardware-backed protection, now is the time to move forward with a new Windows 11 PC. ↫ Some overpaid executive at Microsoft What makes this so incredibly aggravating and deeply tone-deaf is that for most of the people affected by this, &#8220;upgrading&#8221; to Windows 11 simply isn&#8217;t a realistic option. Their current PC is most likely performing and working just fine, but the steep and strict hardware requirements prohibit them from installing Windows 11. Buying an entirely new PC is often not only not needed from a performance perspective, but for many, many people also simply unaffordable. In case you haven&#8217;t noticed, it&#8217;s not exactly going great, financially, for a lot of people out there, and even in the US alone, 70-80% of people live paycheck-to-paycheck, and they&#8217;re certainly not going to be able to just &#8220;move forward with a new Windows 11 PC&#8221; for nebulous and often regressive &#8220;benefits&#8221; like &#8220;AI&#8221;. The fact that Microsoft seems to think all of those hundreds of millions of people not only want to buy a new PC to get &#8220;AI&#8221; features, but that they also can afford it like it&#8217;s no big deal, shows some real lack of connective tissue between the halls of Microsoft&#8217;s headquarters and the wider world. Microsoft&#8217;s utter lack of a grasp on the financial realities of so many individuals and families today is shocking, at best, and downright offensive, at worst. I guess if you live in a world where you can casually bribe a president-elect for one million dollars, buying a new computer feels like buying a bag of potatoes.

## Why Half-Life 3 speculation is reaching a fever pitch again

date: 2025-01-05, from: OS News

The more than two decades since Half-Life 2&#8216;s release have been filled with plenty of rumors and hints about Half-Life 3, ranging from the official&#8211;ish to the thin to the downright misleading. As we head into 2025, though, we&#8217;re approaching something close to a critical mass of rumors and leaks suggesting that Half-Life 3 is really in the works this time, and could be officially announced in the coming months. ↫ Kyle Orland at Ars Technica We should all be skeptical of anything related to Half-Life 3, but there&#8217;s no denying something&#8217;s buzzing. The one reason why I personally think a Half-Life 3 might be happening is the imminent launch of SteamOS for generic PCs, possibly accompanied by prebuilt SteamOS PCs and consoles and third-party Steam Decks. It makes perfect sense for Valve to have such a launch accompanied by the release of Half-Life 3, similar to how Half-Life 2 was accompanied by the launch of Steam. We&#8217;ll have to wait and see. It will be hard to fulfill all the crazy expectations, though.
