## NASA Sets Sights on Mars Terrain with Revolutionary Tire Tech

## 9front “THIS TIME DEFINITELY” released

date: 2025-01-21, from: OS News

The operating system I&#8217;m not cool enough to run has pushed out a new release: 9front “THIS TIME DEFINITELY” is now available. 9front is a fork of plan9, created after plan9 languished at Bell Labs. This release enables gefs, the new file system, in the installer, &#8220;ip/ipconfig now support dhcpv6 dynamic allocations and handles prefix expirations&#8221;, and it comes with some smaller changes, too, of course. Despite every piece of evidence to the contrary, I am simply not cool enough to run 9front. Maybe one day they&#8217;ll notice me, and I get invited to the cool table where the Puffs eat lunch. Who doesn&#8217;t want to ring a bell in the headmaster&#8217;s office at midnight?

## Right to root access

date: 2025-01-21, from: OS News

I believe consumers, as a right, should be able to install software of their choosing to any computing device that is owned outright. This should apply regardless of the computer’s form factor. In addition to traditional computing devices like PCs and laptops, this right should apply to devices like mobile phones, “smart home” appliances, and even industrial equipment like tractors. In 2025, we’re ultra-connected via a network of devices we do not have full control over. Much of this has to do with how companies lock their devices’ bootloaders, prevent root access, and prohibit installation of software that is not explicitly sanctioned through approval in their own distribution channels. We should really work on changing that. ↫ Medhir Bhargava Obviously, this is preaching to the choir here on OSNews. I agree with Bhargava 100%. It should be illegal for any manufacturer of computing devices &#8211; with a possible exception for, say, things like medical implants, certain aspects of car control units, and so on &#8211; to lock down and/or restrict owners&#8217; ability to install whatever software they want, run whatever code they want, and install whatever operating system they want on the devices that they own. Computers are interwoven into the very fabric of every aspect of our society, and having them under the sole control of the biggest megacorporations in the world is utterly dystopian, and wildly dangerous. Personally, I would take it a step further: any and all code that runs on products sold must be open. Not necessarily open source, but at the very least open, so that it can be inspected when malice is suspected. This way, society can make sure that the tech billionaire oligarchs giving nazi salutes aren&#8217;t in full, black-box control over our devices. Secrecy as a means of corporate control is incredibly dangerous, and forcing all code to be open is the perfect way to combat this. Copyright is more than enough intellectual property protection for code. The odds of this happening are, of course, slim, especially with the aforementioned tech billionaire oligarchs giving nazi salutes effectively running the most powerful military in human history. Reason is in short supply these days, and I doubt that&#8217;s going to change any time soon.

## How UNIX spell ran in 64kB RAM

date: 2025-01-20, from: OS News

How do you fit a 250kB dictionary in 64kB of RAM and still perform fast lookups? For reference, even with modern compression techniques like gzip -9, you can&#8217;t compress this file below 85kB. In the 1970s, Douglas McIlroy faced this exact challenge while implementing the spell checker for Unix at AT&#38;T. The constraints of the PDP-11 computer meant the entire dictionary needed to fit in just 64kB of RAM. A seemingly impossible task. ↫ Abhinav Upadhyay They still managed to do it, but had to employ some incredibly clever tricks to make it work, and make it work fast. Such skillful engineers interested in optimising and eeking the most possible performance out of underpowered hardware still exist today, but they&#8217;re not in any position to make lasting changes at any of the companies defining our technology today. Why spend money on skilled engineers, when you can just throw cheap hardware at the problem? I wonder just how many resources the spellchecking feature in Word or LibreOffice Writer takes up.

## Introduction to GrapheneOS

date: 2025-01-20, from: OS News

GrapheneOS (written GOS from now on) is an Android based operating system that focuses security. It is only compatible with Google Pixel devices for multiple reasons: availability of hardware security components, long term support (series 8 and 9 are supported at least 7 years after release) and the hardware has a good quality / price ratio. The goal of GOS is to provide users a lot more control about what their smartphone is doing. A main profile is used by default (the owner profile), but users are encouraged to do all their activities in a separate profile (or multiples profiles). This may remind you about Qubes OS workflow, although it does not translate entirely here. Profiles can not communicate between each others, encryption is done per profile, and some permissions can be assigned per profile (installing apps, running applications in background when a profile is not used, using the SIM&#8230;). This is really effective for privacy or security reasons (or both), you can have a different VPN per profile if you want, or use a different Google Play login, different applications sets, whatever! The best feature here in my opinion is the ability to completely stop a profile so you are sure it does not run anything in the background once you exit it. ↫ Solène Rapenne I switched to GrapheneOS on my Pixel 8 Pro as part of my process to cleanse myself of as much Big Tech as possible, and I&#8217;ve been incredibly happy with it. The additional security and privacy control GrapheneOS brings is amazing, and the fact it opted for a sandboxed Google Play Services basically means there&#8217;s no compatibility issues, unlike when using microG, where compatibility problems are a fact of life. GrapheneOS&#8217; security and other updates are on par or even faster than the stock Google Pixel&#8217;s Android, and the overall user experience is virtually identical to stock Android. The only downside is the reliance on Pixel devices &#8211; it&#8217;s an understandable choice, but does mean giving money to Google if you don&#8217;t already own a Pixel. A workaround, if you will, is to buy a used or refurbished Pixel, but that may not always be an option either. For me personally, I&#8217;ll be sticking with my Pixel 8 Pro for a long time, but if it were to break, I&#8217;d most likely go the used Pixel route to avoid enriching Google. For pretty much anyone reading OSNews, GrapheneOS would be a great choice, and if you already have a Pixel, I strongly urge you consider switching.

## Linux 6.13 released

Linux 6.13 also brings more Rust programming language infrastructure and more. ↫ Michael Larabel A big release, with a ton of new features.
