## Never forgive them

date: 2024-12-21, from: OS News

The people running the majority of internet services have used a combination of monopolies and a cartel-like commitment to growth-at-all-costs thinking to make war with the user, turning the customer into something between a lab rat and an unpaid intern, with the goal to juice as much value from the interaction as possible. To be clear, tech has always had an avaricious streak, and it would be naive to suggest otherwise, but this moment feels different. I’m stunned by the extremes tech companies are going to extract value from customers, but also by the insidious way they’ve gradually degraded their products.  ↫ Ed Zitron This is the reality we&#8217;re all living in, and it&#8217;s obvious from any casual computer use, or talking to anyone who uses computers, just how absolutely dreadful using the mainstream platforms and services has become. Google Search has become useless, DuckDuckGo is being overrun with &#8220;AI&#8221;-generated slop, Windows is the operating system equivalent of this, Apple doesn&#8217;t even know how to make a settings application anymore, iOS is yelling at you about all the Apple subscriptions you don&#8217;t have yet, Android is adding &#8220;AI&#8221; to its damn file manager, and the web is unusable without aggressive ad blocking. And all of this is not only eating up our computers&#8217; resources, it&#8217;s also actively accelerating the destruction of our planet, just so lazy people can generate terrible images where people have six fingers. I&#8217;m becoming more and more extreme in my complete and utter dismissal of the major tech companies, and I&#8217;m putting more and more effort into taking back control ovewr the digital aspects of my life wherever possible. Not using Windows or macOS has improved the user experience of my PCs and laptops by incredible amounts, and moving from Google&#8217;s Android to GrapheneOS has made my smartphone feel more like it&#8217;s actually mine than ever before. Using technology products and services made by people who actually care and have morals and values that don&#8217;t revolve around unending greed is having a hugely positive impact on my life, and I&#8217;m at the point now where I&#8217;d rather not have a smartphone or computer than be forced to use trashware like Windows, macOS, or iOS. The backlash against shitty technology companies and their abusive practices is definitely growing, and while it hasn&#8217;t exploded into the mainstream just yet, I think we&#8217;re only a few more shitty iOS updates and useless Android &#8220;AI&#8221; features away from a more general uprising against the major technology platforms. There&#8217;s a reason laws like the DMA are so overwhelmingy popular, and I feel like this is only the beginning.

## What does APPEND do in DOS?

date: 2024-12-20, from: OS News

The working principle of APPEND is not complicated. It primarily serves as a bridge between old DOS applications which have no or poor support for directories, and users who really, really want to organize files and programs in multiple directories and possibly across multiple drive letters. Of course the actual APPEND implementation is anything but straightforward. ↫ Michal Necasek Another gem of an article by Michal Necasek, detailing a command I&#8217;ve known about almost all my life but never once knew what it was supposed to be for. The gist is that APPEND allows for files to be opened not only in the current working directory, but also up to two levels deeper. This gives you a rudimentary way of working with directories, even when using programs or commands that have no clue what directories even are. since DOS 1.x doesn&#8217;t support directories, but DOS 2.x does, having a tool like this to create a bridge between the pre and post-directory worlds can be quite useful. I&#8217;ve basically learned more about DOS from Necasek&#8217;s work in the past few years than I learned about DOS when I was actively using it in the early &#8217;90s.

## T2 Linux takes weird architectures seriously, including my beloved PA-RISC

date: 2024-12-20, from: OS News

With more and more Linux distributions &#8211; as well as the kernel itself &#8211; dropping support for more exotic, often dead architectures, it&#8217;s a blessing T2 Linux exists. This unique, source-based Linux distribution focuses on making it as easy as possible to build a Linux installation tailored to your needs, and supports an absolutely insane amount of architectures and platforms. In fact, calling T2 a &#8220;distribution&#8221; does it a bit of a disservice, since it&#8217;s much more than that. You may have noticed the banner at the top of OSNews, and if we somehow &#8211; unlikely! -manage to reach that goal before the two remaining new-in-box HP c8000 PA-RISC workstations on eBay are sold, my plan is indeed to run HP-UX as my only operating system for a week, because I like inflicting pain on myself. However, I also intend to use that machine to see just how far T2 Linux on PA-RISC can take me, and if it can make a machine like the c8000, which is plenty powerful with its two dual-core 1.0Ghz PA-RISC processors, properly useful in 2024. T2 Linux 24.12 has just been released, and it brings with it the latest versions of the Linux kernel, gcc, LLVM/Clang, and so on. With T2 Linux, which describes itself as a System Development Environment, it&#8217;s very easy to spin up a heavily customised Linux installation fit for your purpose, targeting anything from absolutely resource-starved embedded systems to big hunks of, I don&#8217;t know, SPARC or POWER metal. If you&#8217;ve got hardware with a processor in it, you can most likely build T2 for it. The project also provides a large number of pre-built ISOs for a whole slew of supported architectures, sometimes further divided into glibc or musl, so you can quickly get started even without having to build something yourself. It&#8217;s an utterly unique project that deserves more attention than it&#8217;s getting, especially since it seems to be one of the last Linux &#8220;distributions&#8221; that takes supporting weird platforms out-of-the-box seriously. Think of it as the NetBSD of the Linux world, and I know for a fact that there&#8217;s a very particular type of person to whom that really appeals.

## Intel admits it no longer controls the direction of x86

date: 2024-12-20, from: OS News

Remember x86S, Intel&#8217;s initiative to create a 64bit-only x86 instruction set, with the goal of removing some of the bloat that the venerable architecture accumulated over the decades? Well, this initiative is now dead, and more or less replaced with the x86 Ecosystem Advisory Group, a collection of companies with a stake in keeping x86 going. Most notably, this includes Intel and AMD, but also other tech giants like Google. In the first sign of changes to come after the formation of a new industry group, Intel has confirmed to&#160;Tom&#8217;s Hardware&#160;that it is no longer working on the x86S specification. The decision comes after Intel announced the formation of the&#160;x86 Ecosystem Advisory Group, which brings together Intel, AMD, Google, and numerous other industry stalwarts to define the future of the x86 instruction set. Intel originally announced its intentions to de-bloat the x86 instruction set by developing a simplified 64-bit mode-only x86S version, publishing a draft specification in&#160;May 2023,&#160;and then updating it to a 1.2 revision in June of this year. Now, the company says it has officially ended that initiative. ↫ Paul Alcorn This seems like an acknowledgement of the reality that Intel is no longer in the position it once was when it comes to steering the direction of x86. It&#8217;s AMD that&#8217;s doing most of the heavy-lifting for the architecture at the moment, and it&#8217;s been doing that for a while now, with little signs that&#8217;s going to chance. I doubt Intel had enough clout left to push something as relatively drastic as x86S, and now has to rely on building concensus with other companies invested in x86. It may seem like a small thing, and I doubt many larger tech outlets will care, but this story is definitely the biggest sign yet that Intel is in a lot more trouble than people already seem to think based on Intel&#8217;s products and market performance. What we have here is a full admission by Intel that they no longer control the direction of x86, and have to rely on the rest of the industry to help them. That&#8217;s absolutely wild.

## The European Commission’s proposed interoperability measures place Apple under a form of guardianship

date: 2024-12-19, from: OS News

What&#8217;s the European Commission to do when one of the largest corporations in the world has not only been breaking its laws continually, but also absolutely refuses to comply, uses poison pills in its malicious compliance, badmouths you in the press through both official &#8211; and unofficial &#8211; employees? Well, you start telling that corporation exactly what it needs to do to comply, down to the most minute implementation details, and in the process take away any form of wiggle room. Steven Troughton-Smith, an absolute wizard when it comes to the inner workings of Apple&#8217;s various platforms and allround awesome person, dove into the European Commission&#8217;s proposed next steps when it comes to dealing with Apple&#8217;s refusal to comply with EU law &#8211; the Digital Markets Act, in particular &#8211; and it&#8217;s crystal-clear that the EC is taking absolutely no prisoners. They&#8217;re not only telling Apple exactly what kind of interoperability measures it must take, down to the API level, but they&#8217;re also explicitly prohibiting Apple from playing games through complex contracts and nebulous terms to try and make interoperability a massive burden. As an example of just how detailed the EC is getting with Apple, here&#8217;s what the company needs to do to make AirDrop interoperable: Apple shall provide a protocol specification that gives third parties all information required to integrate, access, and control the AirDrop protocol within an application or service (including as part of the operating system) running on a third-party connected physical device in order to allow these applications and services to send files to, and receive files from, an iOS device. ↫ European Commission In addition, Apple must make any new features or changes to AirDrop available to third parties at the same time as it releases them: For future functionalities of or updates to the AirDrop feature, Apple shall make them available to third parties no later than at the time they are made available to any Apple connected physical device. ↫ European Commission These specific quotes only cover AirDrop, but similar demands are made about things like AirPlay, the easy pairing process currently reserved for Apple&#8217;s own accessories, and so on. I highly suggest reading the source document, or at the very least the excellent summary thread by Steven, to get an even better idea of what the EC is demanding here. The changes must be made in the next major version of iOS, or at the very latest before the end of 2025. The EC really goes into excruciating detail about how Apple is supposed to implement these interoperability features, and leaves very little to no wiggle room for Apple shenanigans. The EC is also clearly fed up with Apple&#8217;s malicious compliance and other tactics to violate the spirit of the DMA: Apple shall not impose any restrictions on the type or use case of the software application and connected physical device that can access or makeuse of the features listed in this Document. Apple shall not undermine effective interoperability with the 11 features set out in this Document by behaviour of a technical nature. In particular, Apple shall actively take all the necessary actions to allow effective interoperability with these features.  Apple shall not impose any contractual or commercial restrictions that would be opaque, unfair, unreasonable, or discriminatory towards third parties or otherwise defeat the purpose of enabling effective interoperability. In particular, Apple shall not restrict business users, directly or indirectly, to make use of any interoperability solution in their existing apps via an automatic update. ↫ European Commission What I find most interesting about all of this is that it could have been so easily avoided by Apple. Had Apple approached the EU and the DMA with the same kind of respect, grace, and love Apple and Tim Cook clearly reserve for totalitarian dictatorships like China, Apple could&#8217;ve enabled interoperability in such a way that it would still align with most of Apple&#8217;s interests. They would&#8217;ve avoided the endless stream of negative press this fruitless &#8220;fight&#8221; with the EU is generating, and it would&#8217;ve barely impacted Apple&#8217;s bottom line. Put it on one of those Apple microsites that capture your scrolling, boast about how amazing Apple is and how much they love interoperability, and it most likely would&#8217;ve been a massive PR win. Instead, under the mistaken impression that this is a business negotiation, Apple tried to cry, whine, throw tamper tantrums, and just generally act like horrible spoiled brats just because someone far, far more powerful than they are told them &#8220;no&#8221; for once. Now they&#8217;ve effectively been placed under guardianship, and have to do exactly as the European Commission tells them to, down to the API level, without any freedom to make their own choices. The good thing is that the EC&#8217;s journey to make iOS a better and more capable operating system continues. We all benefit. Well, us EU citizens, anyway.

## How to make an Apple Watch work with Android

What if you have an Android phone, but consider the Apple Watch superior to other smartwatches? Well, you could switch to iOS, or, you know, you could hack your way into making an Apple Watch work with Android, like Abishek Muthian did. So I decided to make Apple Watch work with my Android phone using open-source applications, interoperable protocols and 3rd party services. If you just want to use my code and techniques and not read my commentary on it then feel free to checkout my GitHub for sources. ↫ Abishek Muthian Getting notifications to work, so that notifications from the Android phone would show up on the Apple Watch, was the hardest part. Muthian had to write a Python script to read the notifications on the Android device using Termux, and then use Pushover to send them to the Apple Watch. For things like contacts and calendar, he relied on *DAV, which isn&#8217;t exactly difficult to set up, so pretty much anyone who&#8217;s reading this can do that. Sadly, initial setup of the watch did require the use of an iPhone, using the same SIM as is in the Android phone. This way, it&#8217;s possible to set up mobile data as well as calling, and with the SIM back in the Android phone, a call will show up on both the Apple Watch and the Android device. Of course, this initial setup makes the process a bit more cumbersome than just buying a used Apple Watch off eBay or whatever, but I&#8217;m honestly surprised everything&#8217;s working as well as it does. This goes to show that the Apple Watch is not nearly as &#8220;deeply integrated&#8221; with the iPhone as Apple so loves to claim, and making the Apple Watch work with Android in a more official manner certainly doesn&#8217;t look to be as impossible as Apple makes it out to be when dealing with antitrust regulators. Of course, any official support would be much more involved, especially in the testing department, but it would be absolute peanuts, financially, for a company with Apple&#8217;s disgusting level of wealth. Anyway, if you want to setup an Apple Watch with Android, Muthian has put the code on GitHub.

## A quick look at OS/2’s built-in virtualisation

date: 2024-12-18, from: OS News

Most of us are aware that IBM&#8217;s OS/2 has excellent compatibility with DOS and Windows 3.x programs, to the point where OS/2 just ships with an entire installation of Windows 3.x built-in that you can run multiple instances of. In fact, to this day, ArcaOS, the current incarnation of the maintained and slightly modernised OS/2 codebase, still comes with an entire copy of Windows 3.x, making ArcaOS one of the very best ways to run DOS and Windows 3.x programs on a modern machine, without resorting to VMware or VirtualBox. Peter Hofmann took a look at one of the earlier versions of OS/2 &#8211; version 2.1 from 1993 &#8211; to see how its DOS compatibility actually works, or more specifically, the feature &#8220;DOS from drive A:&#8221;. You can insert a bootable DOS floppy and then run&#160;that&#160;DOS in a new window. Since this is called &#8220;DOS&#160;from drive A:&#8221;, surely this is something DOS-specific, right? Maybe only supports MS-DOS or even only PC DOS? Far from it, apparently. ↫ Peter Hofmann Hofmann wrote a little test program using nothing but BIOS system calls, meaning it doesn&#8217;t use any DOS system calls. This &#8220;real mode BIOS program&#8221; can run from the bootsector, if you wanted to, so after combining his test program with a floppy disk boot record, you end up with a bootable floppy that runs the test program, for instance in QEMU. After a bit of work, the test program on the bootable floppy will work just fine using OS/2&#8217;s &#8220;DOS from drive A:&#8221; feature, even though it shouldn&#8217;t. What this seems to imply is that this functionality in OS/2 2.1 looks a lot like a hypervisor, or as Hofmann puts it, &#8220;basically a builtin QEMU that anybody with a 386 could use&#8221;. That&#8217;s pretty advanced for the time, and raises a whole bunch of questions about just how much you can do with this.

## Fedora proposes dropping Atomic desktops for PPC64LE

date: 2024-12-18, from: OS News

Fedora is proposing to stop building their Atomic desktop versions for PPC64LE. PopwerPC 64 LE basically comes down to IBM&#8217;s POWER architecture, and as far as desktop use goes, that exclusively means the POWER9 machines from Raptor Computing Systems. I reviewed their small single-socket Blackbird machine in 2021, and I also have their dual-socket Talos II workstation. I can tell you from experience that nobody who owns one of these is opting for an immutable Fedora variant, and on top of that, these machines are getting long in the tooth. Raptor passed on POWER10 because it required proprietary firmware, so we&#8217;ve been without new machines for years now. As such, it makes sense for Fedora to stop building Atomic desktops for this architecture. We will stop building the Fedora Atomic Desktops for the PowerPC 64 LE architecture. According to the count me statistics, we don&#8217;t have any Atomic Desktops users on PPC64LE. Users of Atomic Desktops on PPC64LE will have to either switch back to a Fedora package mode installation or build their own images using Bootable Containers which are available for PPC64LE. ↫ Timothée Ravier I&#8217;ve never written much about the Talos II, surmising that most of my Blackbird review applies to the Talos II, as well. If there&#8217;s interest, I can check to see what the current state of Fedora and/or other distributions on POWER9 is, and write a short review about the experience. I honestly don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s much interest at this point in POWER9, but if there is, here&#8217;s your chance to get your questions answered.

## Microsoft Recall screenshots credit cards and Social Security numbers, even with the “sensitive information” filter enabled

date: 2024-12-16, from: OS News

Microsoft’s Recall feature recently made its way back to Windows Insiders after having been pulled from test builds back in June, due to security and privacy concerns. The new version of Recall encrypts the screens it captures and, by default, it has a “Filter sensitive information,” setting enabled, which is supposed to prevent it from recording any app or website that is showing credit card numbers, social security numbers, or other important financial / personal info. In my tests, however, this filter only worked in some situations (on two e-commerce sites), leaving a gaping hole in the protection it promises. ↫ Avram Piltch at Tom&#8217;s Hardware Recall might be one of the biggest own goals I have seen in recent technology history. In fact, it&#8217;s more of a series of own goals that just keep on coming, and I honestly have no idea why Microsoft keeps making them, other than the fact that they&#8217;re so high on their own &#8220;AI&#8221; supply that they just lost all touch with reality at this point. There&#8217;s some serious Longhorn-esque tunnel vision here, a project during which the company also kind of forgot the outside world existed beyond the walls of Microsoft&#8217;s Redmond headquarters. It&#8217;s clear by now that just like many other tech companies, Microsoft is so utterly convinced it needs to shove &#8220;AI&#8221; into every corner of its products, that it no longer seems to be asking the most important question during product development: do people actually want this? The response to Windows Recall has been particularly negative, yet Microsoft keep pushing and pushing it, making all the mistakes along the way everybody has warned them about. It&#8217;s astonishing just how dedicated they are to a feature nobody seem to want, and everybody seems to warn them about. It&#8217;s like we&#8217;re all Kassandra. The issue in question here is exactly as dumb as you expect it to be. The &#8220;Filter sensitive information&#8221; setting is so absurdly basic and dumb it basically only seems to work on shopping sites, not anywhere else where credit card or other sensitive information might be shown. This shortcoming is obvious to anyone who think about what Recall does for more than one nanosecond, but Microsoft clearly didn&#8217;t take a few moments to think about this, because their response is to let them know through the Feedback Hub any time Recall fails to detect and sensitive information. They&#8217;re basically asking you, the consumer, to be the filter. Unpaid, of course. After the damage has already been done. Wild. If you can ditch Windows, you should. Windows is not a place of honour.

## Fedora’s new Btrfs SIG should focus on making Btrfs’ features more accessible

date: 2024-12-16, from: OS News

As Michel Lind mentioned back in August, we wanted to form a Special Interest Group to further the development and adoption of Btrfs in Fedora. As of yesterday, the SIG is now formed. ↫ Neal Gompa Since I&#8217;ve been using Fedora on all my machines for a while now, I&#8217;ve also been using Btrfs as my one and only file system for just as much time, without ever experiencing any issues. In fact, I recently ordered four used 4TB enterprise hard drives (used, yes, but zero SMART issues) to set up a storage pool whereto I can download my favourite YouTube playlists so I don&#8217;t have to rely on internet connectivity and YouTube not being shit. I combined the four drives into a single 16TB Btrfs volume, and it&#8217;s working flawlessly. Of course, not having any redundancy is a terrible idea, but I didn&#8217;t care much since it&#8217;s just downloaded YouTube videos. However, it&#8217;s all working so flawlessly, and the four drives were so cheap, I&#8217;m going to order another four drives and turn the whole thing into a 16TB Btrfs volume using one of the Btrfs RAID profiles for proper redundancy, even if it &#8220;costs&#8221; me half of the 32TB of total storage. This way, I can also use it as an additional backup for more sensitive data, which is never a bad thing. The one big downside here is that all of this has to be set up and configured using the command line. While that makes sense in a server environment and I had no issues doing so, I think a product that calls itself Fedora Workstation (or, in my case, Fedora KDE, but the point stands) should have proper graphical tools for managing the file system it uses. Fedora should come with a graphical utility to set up, manage, and maintain Btrfs volumes, so you don&#8217;t have to memorise a bunch of arcane commands. I know a lot of people get very upset when you even suggest someting like this, but that&#8217;s just elitist nonsense. Btrfs has various incredibly useful features that should be exposed to users of all kinds, not just sysadmins and weird nerds &#8211; and graphical tools are a great way to do this. I don&#8217;t know exactly what the long-term plans of the new Btrrfs SIG are going to be, but I think making the useful features of Btrfs more accessible should definitely be on the list. You shouldn&#8217;t need to be a CLI expert to set up resilient, redundant local storage on your machine, especially now that the interest in digital self-sufficiency is increasing.

## There’s a market out there for a modern X11/Motif-based desktop distribution

date: 2024-12-15, from: OS News

EMWM is a fork of the Motif Window Manager with fixes and enhancements. The idea behind this is to provide compatibility with current xorg extensions and applications, without changing the way the window manager looks and behaves. This includes support for multi-monitor setups through Xinerama/Xrandr, UFT-8 support with Xft fonts, and overall better compatibility with software that requires&#160;Extended Window Manager Hints. Additionally a couple of goodies are available in the separate utilities package:&#160;XmToolbox, a&#160;toolchest&#160;like application launcher, which reads it&#8217;s multi-level menu structure from a simple plain-text file ~/.toolboxrc, and&#160;XmSm, a simple session manager that provides session configuration, locking and shutdown/suspend options. ↫ EMWM homepage I had never heard of EMWM, but I immediately like it. This same developer, Alexander Pampuchin, also develops XFile, a file manager for X11 which presents the file system as it actually is, instead of using a bunch of &#8220;imaginary&#8221; locations to hide the truth, if you will. On top of that, they also develop XImaging, a comprehensive image viewer for X11. All of these use the Motif widget toolkit, focus on plain X11, and run on most Linux distributions and BSDs. They need to be compiled by the user, most likely. I am convinced that there is a small but sustainable audience for a modern, up-to-date Linux distribution (although a BSD would work just as well), that instead of offering GNOME, KDE, Xfce, or whatever, focuses instead of delivering a traditional, yet modernised and maintained, desktop environment and applications using not much more than X11 and Motif, eschewing more complex stuff like GTK, Qt, systemd, Wayland, and so on. I would use the hell out of a system that gives me a version of the Motif-based desktops like CDE from the &#8217;90s, but with some modern amenities, current hardware support, support for high-resolution displays, and so on. You can certainly grab bits and bobs left and right from the web and build something like this from scratch, but not everyone has the skills and time to do so, yet I think there&#8217;s enough people out there who are craving for something like this. There&#8217;s tons of maintained X11/Motif software out there &#8211; it&#8217;s just all spread out, disorganised, and difficult to assemble because it almost always means compiling it all from scratch, and most people simply don&#8217;t have the time and energy for that. Package this up on a solid Debian, Fedora, or FreeBSD base, and I think you&#8217;ve got quite some users lining up.

## Xfce 4.20 with experimental Wayland support released

date: 2024-12-15, from: OS News

After two years of intense development, the third major Linux desktop environment has released a new version: Xfce 4.20 is here. The major focus of this release cycle was getting Xfce ready for Wayland, and they&#8217;ve achieved quite a bit of that goal, but support for it is still experimental. Thanks to&#160;Brian&#160;and&#160;Gaël&#160;almost all Xfce components are able to run on Wayland windowing, while still keeping support for X11 windowing. This major effort was achieved by abstracting away any X11/Wayland windowing specific calls and making use of Wayland/Wlroots protocols. A whole new Xfce library, &#8220;libxfce4windowing&#8221; was introduced during that process. XWayland will not be required to run any of the ported Xfce components. ↫ Xfce development team A major gap in Xfce&#8217;s Wayland support is the fact that Xfwm4 has not been ported to Wayland yet, so the team suggests using Labwc or Wayfire instead if you want to dive into using Xfce on Wayland. While there are plans to port Xfwm4 over to Wayland, this requires a major restructuring and they&#8217;re not going to set any timelines or expectations for when this will be completed. Regardless, this is an excellent achievement and solid progress for Xfce on Wayland, which is pretty much a requirement for Xfce (and other desktop environments) te remain relevant going forward. Of course, while Wayland is a major focus this release, there&#8217;s a lot more here, too &#8211; and that&#8217;s not doing the Xfce developers justice. Xfce 4.20 comes packed with so many new features, enchancements, and bug fixes across the board that I have no idea where to start. I like the large number of changes to Thunar, like the ability to use symoblic icons in the sidebar, optimising it for small window sizes, automatically opening folders when dragging and dropping, and so much more. They&#8217;ve also done another pass to update any remaining icons not working well on HiDPI displays, removing any instances where you&#8217;d encounter fuzzy icons. I can&#8217;t wait to give Xfce 4.20 a go once it lands in Fedora Xfce.
