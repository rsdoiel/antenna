## Exploring the (discontinued) hybrid Debian GNU/kFreeBSD distribution

date: 2025-03-10, from: OS News

For decades, Linux and BSD have stood as two dominant yet fundamentally different branches of the Unix-like operating system world. While Linux distributions, such as Debian, Ubuntu, and Fedora, have grown to dominate the open-source ecosystem, BSD-based systems like FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and NetBSD have remained the preferred choice for those seeking security, performance, and licensing flexibility. But what if you could combine the best of both worlds—Debian’s vast package ecosystem with FreeBSD’s robust and efficient kernel? Enter Debian GNU/kFreeBSD, a unique experiment that merges Debian’s familiar userland with the FreeBSD kernel, offering a hybrid system that takes advantage of FreeBSD’s technical prowess while maintaining the ease of use associated with Debian. This article dives into the world of Debian GNU/kFreeBSD, exploring its architecture, installation, benefits, challenges, and real-world applications. ↫ George Whittaker More of a list of upsides and downsides than an actual in-depth article, but that doesn&#8217;t make it any less interesting. There&#8217;s a variety of attempts out there to somehow marry the Linux and BSD worlds, and each of them takes a unique approach. I&#8217;m not sure the Debian userland with a FreeBSD kernel is the way to go, though, and it seems I&#8217;m not alone &#8211; Debian GNU/kFreeBSD was officially dropped from Debian in 2015 or so, and after a flurry of unofficial activity in 2019, it was discontinued completely in 2023 due to a lack of activity and developer interest. Odd that the source article doesn&#8217;t mention that. If you&#8217;re still interested in a combination of Linux and BSD, I&#8217;d keep an eye on Chimera Linux instead. It&#8217;s very actively developed, focuses on portable code by supporting many architectures, and its developers are veterans in this space. I have my eye on Chimera Linux as my future distribution of choice.

## Brother denies using firmware updates to brick printers with third-party ink

date: 2025-03-10, from: OS News

Brother laser printers are popular recommendations for people seeking a printer with none of the nonsense. By nonsense, we mean printers suddenly bricking features, like scanning or printing, if users install third-party cartridges. Some printer firms outright block third-party toner and ink, despite customer blowback and lawsuits. Brother’s laser printers have historically worked fine with non-Brother accessories. A YouTube video posted this week, though, as well as older social media posts, claim that Brother has gone to the dark side and degraded laser printer functionality with third-party cartridges. Brother tells Ars that this isn’t true. ↫ Scharon Harding at Ars Technica I find this an incredibly interesting story. We all know the printer space is a cursed hellhole of the very worst worst types of enshittification, but Brother seemed like an island of relative calm in a sea of bullshit. In turn, people are so used to printers being shit, that any problem that comes up is automatically explained by malice, which is not entirely unreasonable. Borther insists, though, that it does not break printers using third-party toner or ink through firmware. Brother does make it very clear that it is standard procedure to only perform troubleshooting on Brother printers using &#8216;genuine&#8217; Brother ink and toner, which is not entirely unreasonable in my book. There&#8217;s no telling what kind of effects third part cartridges &#8211; which do contain electronics &#8211; have on the rest of the printer, and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s fair to expect Brother to be able to document all of those possible issues. As long as using third-party toner and ink cartridges doesn&#8217;t invalidate any warranties, and as long as Brother doesn&#8217;t intentionally break printers for using third-party toner and ink, I think Brother meets its obligations to consumers. If you choose to use third-party ink and toner cartridges in Brother printers, I think it&#8217;s only reasonable you remove those during the troubleshooting process to ensure they&#8217;re not the cause of any problems you&#8217;re experiencing.

## Porting the curl command-line tool and library with Goa
