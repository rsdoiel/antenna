## MorphOS 3.19 released

date: 2025-01-18, from: OS News

It&#8217;s been about 18 months, but we&#8217;ve got a new release for MorphOS, the Amiga-like operating system for PowerPC Macs and some other PowerPC-based machines. Going through the list of changes, it seems MorphOS 3.19 focuses heavily on fixing bugs and addressing issues, rather than major new features or earth-shattering changes. Of note are several small but important updates, like updated versions of OpenSSL and OpenSSH, as well as a ton of new filetype definitions &#8211; and so much more. Having a release focused on fixing bugs and addressing smaller issues isn&#8217;t exactly a bad thing though &#8211; I&#8217;ve used MorphOS on my 17&#8243; 1.25Ghz PowerBook G4 often enough to know MorphOS is quite complete, stable, and a ton of fun to use, and much more capable than it has any right to be considering what must be its relatively small developer team and user base. That being said, I do wish MorphOS was available on hardware newer than 20 year old PowerPC Macs, because as much as I like me some classic hardware, the world&#8217;s moving on and even basic web browsing requires much more performant hardware now. Maybe I should try and buy one of the supported Apple PowerPC G5 machines to see just how much better MorphOS runs on that than on my G4.

## Google begins requiring JavaScript for Google Search

date: 2025-01-18, from: OS News

Google says it has begun requiring users to turn on JavaScript, the widely used programming language to make web pages interactive, in order to use Google Search. In an email to TechCrunch, a company spokesperson claimed that the change is intended to “better protect” Google Search against malicious activity, such as bots and spam, and to improve the overall Google Search experience for users. The spokesperson noted that, without JavaScript, many Google Search features won’t work properly and that the quality of search results tends to be degraded. ↫ Kyle Wiggers at TechCrunch One of the strangely odd compliments you could give Google Search is that it would load even on the weirdest or oldest browsers, simply because it didn&#8217;t require JavaScript. Whether I loaded Google Search in the JS-less Dillo, Blazer on PalmOS, or the latest Firefox, I&#8217;d end up with a search box I could type something into and search. Sure, beyond that the web would be, shall we say, problematic, but at least Google Search worked. With this move, Google will end such compatibility, which was most likely a side effect more than policy. I know a lot of people lament the widespread reliance on and requirement to have JavaScript, and it surely can be and is abused, but it&#8217;s also the reality of people asking more and more of their tools on the web. I would love it websites gracefully degraded on browsers without JavaScript, but that&#8217;s simply not a realistic thing to expect, sadly. JavaScript is part of the web now &#8211; and has been for a long time &#8211; and every website using or requiring JavaScript makes the web no more or less &#8220;open&#8221; than the web requiring any of the other myriad of technologies, like more recent versions of TLS. Nobody is stopping anyone from implementing support for JS. I&#8217;m not a proponent of JavaScript or anything like that &#8211; in fact, I&#8217;m annoyed I can&#8217;t load our WordPress backend in browsers that don&#8217;t have it, but I&#8217;m just as annoyed that I can&#8217;t load websites on older machines just because they don&#8217;t have later versions of TLS. Technology &#8220;progresses&#8221;, and as long as the technologies being regarded as &#8220;progress&#8221; are not closed or encumbered by patents, I can be annoyed by it, but I can&#8217;t exactly be against it. The idea that it&#8217;s JavaScript making the web bad and not shit web developers and shit managers and shit corporations sure is one hell of a take.

## Dillo 3.2.0 released

date: 2025-01-18, from: OS News

We&#8217;ve got a new Dillo release for you this weekend! We added SVG support for math formulas and other simple SVG images by patching the nanosvg library. This is specially relevant for Wikipedia math articles. We also added optional support for WebP images via libwebp. You can use the new option ignore_image_formats to ignore image formats that you may not trust (libwebp had some CVEs recently). ↫ Dillo website This release also comes with some UI tweaks, like the ability to move the scrollbar to the left, use the scrollbar to go back and forward exactly one page, the ability to define custom link actions in the context menu, and more &#8211; including the usual bug fixes, of course. Once the pkgsrc bug on HP-UX I discovered and reported is fixed, Dillo is one of the first slightly more complex packages I intend to try and build on HP-UX 11.11.

## Hands-on graphics without X11 using NetBSD’s wscons

date: 2025-01-18, from: OS News

Now, if you have been following the development of EndBASIC, this is not surprising. The defining characteristic of the EndBASIC console is that it’s hybrid as the video shows. What’s newsworthy, however, is that the EndBASIC console can now run directly on a framebuffer exposed by the kernel. No X11 nor Wayland in the picture (pun intended). But how? The answer lies in NetBSD’s flexible wscons framework, and this article dives into what it takes to render graphics on a standard Unix system. I’ve found this exercise exciting because, in the old days, graphics were trivial (mode 13h, anyone?) and, for many years now, computers use framebuffer-backed textual consoles. The kernel is obviously rendering “graphics” by drawing individual letters; so why can’t you, a user of the system, do so too? ↫ Julio Merino This opens up a lot of interesting use cases and fun hacks for developers to implement in their CLI applications. All the code in the article is &#8211; as usual &#8211; way over my head, but will be trivial for quite a few of you. The mentioned EndBASIC project, created by the author, Julio Merino, is fascinating too: EndBASIC is an interpreter for a BASIC-like language and is inspired by Amstrad&#8217;s Locomotive BASIC 1.1 and Microsoft&#8217;s QuickBASIC 4.5. Like the former, EndBASIC intends to provide an interactive environment that seamlessly merges coding with immediate visual feedback. Like the latter, EndBASIC offers higher-level programming constructs and strong typing. EndBASIC&#8217;s primary goal is to offer a simplified and restricted DOS-like environment to learn the foundations of programming and computing, and focuses on features that quickly reward the learner. These include a built-in text editor, commands to manipulate the screen, commands to interact with shared files, and even commands to interact with the hardware of a Raspberry Pi. ↫ EndBASIC website Being able to run this on a machine without having to load either X or Wayland is a huge boon, and makes it accessible fast on quite a lot of hardware on which a full X or Wayland setup would be cumbersome or slow.

## Microsoft adds “AI” to Microsoft 365 and raises prices to pay for it

date: 2025-01-18, from: OS News

Up until now, if you were subscribed to Office 365 &#8211; I think it&#8217;s called Microsoft 365 now &#8211; and you wanted the various &#8220;AI&#8221; Copilot features, you needed to pay $20 extra. Well, that&#8217;s changing, as Microsoft is now adding these features to Microsoft 365 by default, while raising the prices for every subscriber by $3 per month. It seems not enough people were interested in paying $20 per month extra for &#8220;AI&#8221; features in Office, so Microsoft has to force everyone to pay up. It&#8217;s important to note, though, that your usage of the features is limited by how many &#8220;AI credits&#8221; you have, to really nail that slot machine user experience, and you&#8217;re only getting a limited number of those per month. Luckily, existing Microsoft 365 subscribers can opt out of these new features and thus avoid the price increase, which is a genuinely welcome move by Microsoft. New subscribers, however, will not be able to opt out. Finally, we understand that our customers have a variety of needs and budgets, so we’re committed to providing options. Existing subscribers with recurring billing enabled with Microsoft can switch to plans without Copilot or AI credits like our Basic plan, or, for a limited time, to new Personal Classic or Family Classic plans. These plans will continue to be maintained as they exist today, but for certain new innovations and features you’ll need a Microsoft 365 Personal and Family subscription. ↫ Bryan Rognier at the Microsoft blog Microsoft wants to spread the immense cost of running datacentres for &#8220;AI&#8221; to everyone, whether you want to use these features or not. When not enough people want to opt into &#8220;AI&#8221; and pay extra, the only other option is to just make everyone pay, whether they want to or not. Still, the opt-out for existing subscribers is nice, and if you are one and don&#8217;t want to pay $35 per year extra, don&#8217;t forget to opt out.

## Google announces it’s going to intentionally violate EU law

date: 2025-01-17, from: OS News

Google has told the EU it will not add fact checks to search results and YouTube videos or use them in ranking or removing content, despite the requirements of a new EU law, according to a copy of a letter obtained by Axios.  In a letter written to Renate Nikolay, the deputy director general under the content and technology arm at the European Commission, Google&#8217;s global affairs president Kent Walker said the fact-checking integration required by the Commission&#8217;s new Disinformation Code of Practice &#8220;simply isn&#8217;t appropriate or effective for our services&#8221; and said Google won&#8217;t commit to it. ↫ Sara Fischer at Axios Imagine if any one of us, ordinary folk told the authorities we were just not going to follow the law. We&#8217;re not going to pay our taxes because tax law &#8220;simply isn&#8217;t appropriate or effective for our services&#8221;. We&#8217;re not going to follow traffic laws and regulations because doing so &#8220;simply isn&#8217;t appropriate or effective for our services&#8221;. We&#8217;re not going to respect property laws because doing so &#8220;simply isn&#8217;t appropriate or effective for our services&#8221;. We&#8217;d be in trouble within a heartbeat. We&#8217;d be buried in fines, court cases, and eventually, crippling debt, bankruptcy, and most likely end up in prison. The arrogance with which these American tech giants willfully declare themselves to be above EU laws and regulations is appalling, and really should have far more consequences than it does right now. Executives should be charged and arrested, products and services banned and taken off the shelves, and eventually, the companies themselves should be banned from operating within the EU altogether. Especially with the incoming regime in the US, which will most likely grant the tech giants even more freedom to do as they please, the EU needs to start standing up against this sort of gross disrespect. The consequences for a corporation knowingly breaking the law should be just as grave as for an individual citizen knowingly breaking the law.

## Microsoft will also stop supporting Office applications on Windows 10 after October 14

date: 2025-01-15, from: OS News

It seems we&#8217;re getting a glimpse at the next stick Microsoft will be using to push people to buy new PCs (we&#8217;re all rich, according to Microsoft) or upgrade to Windows 11. In a blog post extolling the virtues of a free upgrade from Windows 10 to 11, the company announced that with the end of support for Windows 10, Microsoft will also stop supporting Office applications on Windows 10, otherwise known as Office 365. Lastly, Microsoft 365 Apps will no longer be supported after October 14, 2025, on Windows 10 devices. To use Microsoft 365 Applications on your device, you will need to upgrade to Windows 11. ↫ Microsoft&#8217;s Margaret Farmer Of course, the applications won&#8217;t stop working on Windows 10 right away after that date, but Microsoft won&#8217;t be fixing any security issues, bugs, or other issues that might (will) come up. It reads like a threat to Windows users &#8211; upgrade by buying a new PC you probably can&#8217;t afford, or not only use an insecure version of Windows, but also insecure Office applications. I doubt it&#8217;ll have much of an impact on the staggering number of people still using Windows 10 &#8211; more than 60% of Windows users &#8211; so I&#8217;m sure Microsoft has more draconian plans up its sleeve to push people to upgrade.

## Nepenthes: a dangerous tarpit to trap LLM crawlers

date: 2025-01-15, from: OS News

If you don&#8217;t want OpenAI&#8217;s, Apple&#8217;s, Google&#8217;s, or other companies&#8217; crawlers sucking up the content on your website, there isn&#8217;t much you can do. They generally don&#8217;t care about the venerable robots.txt, and while people like Aaron Schwartz were legally bullied into suicide for downloading scientific articles using a guest account, corporations are free to take whatever they want, permission or no. If corporations don&#8217;t respect us, why should we respect them? There are ways to fight back against these scrapers, and the latest is especially nasty in all the right ways. This is a tarpit intended to catch web crawlers. Specifically, it&#8217;s targeting crawlers that scrape data for LLM&#8217;s &#8211; but really, like the plants it is named after, it&#8217;ll eat just about anything that finds its way inside. It works by generating an endless sequences of pages, each of which with dozens of links, that simply go back into the tarpit. Pages are randomly generated, but in a deterministic way, causing them to appear to be flat files that never change. Intentional delay is added to prevent crawlers from bogging down your server, in addition to wasting their time. Lastly, optional Markov-babble can be added to the pages, to give the crawlers something to scrape up and train their LLMs on, hopefully accelerating model collapse. ↫ ZADZMO.org You really have to know what you&#8217;re doing when you set up this tool. It is intentionally designed to cause harm to LLM web crawlers, but it makes no distinction between LLM crawlers and, say, search engine crawlers, so it will definitely get you removed from search results. On top of that, because Nepenthes is designed to feed LLM crawlers what they&#8217;re looking for, they&#8217;re going to love your servers and thus spike your CPU load constantly. I can&#8217;t reiterate enough that you should not be using this if you don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re doing. Setting it all up is fairly straightforward, but of note is that if you want to use the Markov generation feature, you&#8217;ll need to provide your own corpus for it to feed from. None is included to make sure every installation of Nepenthes will be different and unique because users will choose their own corpus to set up. You can use whatever texts you want, like Wikipedia articles, royalty-free books, open research corpuses, and so on. Nepenthes will also provide you with statistics to see what cats you&#8217;ve dragged in. You can use Nepenthes defensively to prevent LLM crawlers from reaching your real content, while also collecting the IP ranges of the crawlers so you can start blocking them. If you&#8217;ve got enough bandwith and horsepower, you can also opt to use Nepenthes offensively, and you can have some real fun with this. Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;ve got horsepower and bandwidth to burn, and just want to see these AI models burn. Nepenthes has what you need: Don&#8217;t make any attempt to block crawlers with the IP stats. Put the delay times as low as you are comfortable with. Train a big Markov corpus and leave the Markov module enabled, set the maximum babble size to something big. In short, let them suck down as much bullshit as they have diskspace for and choke on it. ↫ ZADZMO.org In a world where we can&#8217;t fight back against LLM crawlers in a sensible and respectful way, tools like these are exactly what we need. After all, the imbalance of power between us normal people and corporations is growing so insanely out of any and all proportions, that we don&#8217;t have much choice but to attempt to burn it all down with more&#8230; Destructive methods. I doubt this will do much to stop LLM crawlers from taking whatever they want without consent &#8211; as I&#8217;ve repeatedly said, Silicon Valley does not understand consent &#8211; but at least it&#8217;s joyfully cathartic.

## A Microsoft change to the Linux kernel caused major breakage, but was caught in time

date: 2025-01-15, from: OS News

A change to the Linux 6.13 kernel contributed by a Microsoft engineer ended up changing Linux x86_64 code without proper authorization and in turn causing troubles for users and now set to be disabled ahead of the Linux 6.13 stable release expected next Sunday. ↫ Michael Larabel What I like about this story is that it seems to underline that the processes, checks, and balances in place in Linux kernel development seem to be working &#8211; at least, this time. A breaking change was caught during the prerelease phase, and a fix has been merged to make sure this issue will be fixed before the stable version of Linux 6.13 is released to the wider public. This all sounds great, but there is an element of this story that raises some serious questions. The change itself was related to EXECMEM_ROX, and was intended to improve performance of 64bit AMD and Intel processors, but in turn, this new code broke Control Flow Integrity on some setups, causing some devices not to wake from hibernation while also breaking other features. What makes this spicy is that the code was merged without acknowledgement from any of the x86 kernel maintainers, which made a lot of people very unhappy &#8211; and understandably so. So while the processes and checks and balances worked here, something still went horribly wrong, as such changes should not be able to be merged without acknowledgement from maintainers. This now makes me wonder how many more times this has happened without causing any instantly discoverable issues. For now, some code has been added to revert the offending changes, and Linux 6.13 will ship with Microsoft&#8217;s bad code disabled.

## Google allows advertisers to fingerprint you for even better tracking

date: 2025-01-14, from: OS News

They tried to keep it from prying eyes, but several people did notice it: Google made a pretty significant policy change regarding the use of fingerprinting by advertisers. While Google did not allow advertisers to use digital fingerprinting, the company has now changed its mind on this one. Google really tried to hide this change. The main support article talking about the reasoning behind the change is intentionally obtuse and nebulous, and doesn&#8217;t even link to the actual policy changes being implemented &#8211; which are found in a separate document. Google doesn&#8217;t highlight its changes there, so you have to compare the two versions of the policy yourself. Google claims this change has to be implemented because of &#8220;advances in privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) such as on-device processing, trusted execution environments, and secure multi-party computation&#8221; and &#8220;the rise of new ad-supported devices and platforms&#8221;. What I think this word salad means is that users are regaining a modicum of privacy with some specific privacy-preserving features in certain operating systems and on certain devices, and that the use of dedicated, siloed streaming services is increasing, which is harder for Google and advertisers to track. In other words, Google is relaxing its rules on fingerprinting because we&#8217;re all getting more conscious about privacy. In any event, the advice remains the same: use ad-blockers, preferably at your network level. Install adblocking software and extensions, set up a Pi-Hole, or turn on any adblocking features in your router (my Ubiquiti router has it built-in, and it works like a charm). Remember: your device, your rules. If you don&#8217;t want to see ads, you don&#8217;t have to.

## FM TOWNS Technical Databook partially translated to English

date: 2025-01-14, from: OS News

In recent months, we&#8217;ve talked twice about FM Towns, Fujitsu&#8217;s PC platform aimed solely at the Japanese market. It was almost entirely only available in Japanese, so it&#8217;s difficult to explore for those of us who don&#8217;t speak Japanese. There&#8217;s an effort underway to recreate it as open source, which will most likely take a while, but in the meantime, a part of the FM TOWNS Technical Databook, written by Noriaki Chiba, has been translated from Japanese into English by Joe Groff. From the book&#8217;s preface: That is why the author wrote this book, to serve as an essential manual for enthusiasts, systems developers, and software developers. Typical computer manuals do not adequately cover technical specifications, so users tend to have a hard time understanding the hardware. We have an opportunity to thoroughly break through this barrier, and with this new hardware architecture being a milestone in the FM series, it feels like the perfect time to try. Hardware manuals up to this point have typically only explained the consequences of the hardware design without explaining its fundamentals. By contrast, this book describes the hardware design of the TOWNS from its foundations. Since even expert systems developers can feel like amateurs when working with devices outside of their repertoire, this book focuses on explaining those foundations. This is especially necessary for the FM TOWNS, since it features so many new devices, including a 80386 CPU and a CD-ROM drive. ↫ Noriaki Chiba  This handbook goes into great detail about the inner workings of the hardware, and chapter II, which hasn&#8217;t been translated yet, also dives deep into the BIOS of the hardware, from its first revisions to all the additional features added on top as time progressed. This book, as well as its translation, will be invaluable to people trying to use Towns OS today, to developers working on emulators for the platform, and anyone who fits somewhere in between. It seems this translation was done entirely in Groff&#8217;s free time as a side project, which is commendable. We&#8217;re looking at about 65000 words in the target language, of a highly technical nature, all translated for free because someone decided it was worth it. Sending this over to a translation agency would most likely cost well over €10000. Of course, that would include additional editing and proofreading by parties other than the initial translator(s), but that&#8217;s definitely not needed for a passion project like this. Excellent, valuable work.

## Let’s talk about bias

date: 2025-01-13, from: OS News

When someone says you’re biased against them because you object to their stated goal of removing you from society, they’re not actually asking for fairness — they’re demanding complicity. It’s the political equivalent of asking why the gazelle seems to have such a negative view of lions. Think about the underlying logic here: I’m biased because I don’t give equal weight to both sides of a debate about my fundamental rights. I’m biased because I notice patterns in political movements that explicitly state their intentions regarding people like me. I’m biased because I take them at their word when they tell me what they plan to do. ↫ Joan Westenberg OSNews and I will always stand for the right of transgender people to exist, and to enjoy the exact same rights and privileges as any other member of society. This is non-negotiable.

## Enlightenment 0.27.0 released

date: 2025-01-13, from: OS News

Enlightenment 0.27.0 has been released, and we&#8217;ve got some highly informative release notes. This is the latest release of Enlightenment. This has a lot of fixes mostly with some new features. ↫ Carsten Haitzler That&#8217;s it. That&#8217;s the release notes. Digging into the commit history between 0.26.0 and 0.27.0 gives some more information, and here we can see that a lot of work has been done on the CPU frequency applet (including hopefully making it work properly on FreeBSD), a lot of updated translations, some RandR work, and a ton of other small changes. Does any one of us use Enlightenment on a daily basis? I&#8217;m actually intrigued by this release, as it&#8217;s the first one in two years, and aside from historical usage decades ago &#8211; like many of us, I assume &#8211; I haven&#8217;t really spent any time with the current incarnation.

## Can you complete the Oregon Trail if you wait at a river for 14272 years: a study

date: 2025-01-13, from: OS News

Two years ago, Twitch streamer albrot discovered a bug in the code for crossing rivers. One of the options is to &#8220;wait to see if conditions improve&#8221;; waiting a day will consume food but not recalculate any health conditions, granting your party immortality. From this conceit the Oregon Trail Time Machine was born; a multiday livestream of the game as the party waits for conditions to improve at the final Snake River crossing until the year 10000, to see if the withered travellers can make it to the ruins of ancient Oregon. The first attempt ended in tragedy; no matter what albrot tried, the party would succumb to disease and die almost immediately. A couple of days before New Years Eve 2025, albrot reached out and asked if I knew anything about Apple II hacking. ↫ Scott Percival It may have required some reverse engineering and hackery, but yes, you can reach the ruins of Oregon in the year 16120.

## “The people should own the town square”

date: 2025-01-13, from: OS News

Mastodon, the only remaining social network that isn&#8217;t a fascist hellhole like Twitter or Facebook, is changing its legal and operational foundation to a proper European non-profit. Simply, we are going to transfer ownership of key Mastodon ecosystem and platform components (including name and copyrights, among other assets) to a new non-profit organization, affirming the intent that Mastodon should not be owned or controlled by a single individual.  It also means a different role for Eugen, Mastodon’s current CEO. Handing off the overall Mastodon management will free him up to focus on product strategy where his original passion lies and he gains the most satisfaction. ↫ Official Mastodon blog Eugen Rochko has always been clear and steadfast about Mastodon not being for sale and not accepting any outside investments despite countless offers, and after eight years of both creating and running Mastodon, it makes perfect sense to move the network and its assets to a proper European non-profit. Mastodon&#8217;s actual control over the entire federated ActivityPub network &#8211; the Fediverse &#8211; is actually limited, so it&#8217;s not like the network is dependent on Mastodon, but there&#8217;s no denying it&#8217;s the most well-known part of the Fediverse. The Fediverse is the only social network on which OSNews is actively present (and myself, too, for that matter). By &#8220;actively present&#8221; I only mean I&#8217;m keeping an eye on any possible replies; the feed itself consists exclusively of links to our stories as soon as they&#8217;re published, and that&#8217;s it. Everything else you might encounter on social media is either legacy cruft we haven&#8217;t deleted yet, or something a third-party set up that we don&#8217;t control. RSS means it&#8217;s easy for people to set up third-party, unaffiliated accounts on any social medium posting links to our stories, and that&#8217;s entirely fine, of course. However, corporate social media controlled by the irrational whims of delusional billionaires with totalitarian tendencies is not something we want to be a part of, so aside from visiting OSNews.com and using our RSS feeds, the only other official way to follow OSNews is on Mastodon.

## WordPress is in trouble

date: 2025-01-13, from: OS News

It’s hard to see how to move forward from here. I think the best bet would be for people to rally around a new community-driven infrastructure. This would likely require a fork of WordPress, though, and that’s going to be a messy. The current open source version of WordPress relies on the sites and services Mullenweg controls. Joost de Valk, the original creator of an extremely popular SEO plugin, wrote a blog post with some thoughts on the matter. I’m hoping that more prominent people in the community step up like this, and that some way forward can be found.  Update: Moments after posting this, I was pointed to a story on TechCrunch about Mullenweg deactivating the WordPress.org accounts of users planning a “fork”. This after he previously promoted (though in a slightly mocking way) the idea of forking open source software. In both cases, the people he mentioned weren’t actually planning forks, but musing about future ways forward for WordPress. Mullenweg framed the account deactivations as giving people the push they need to get started. Remember that WordPress.org accounts are required to submit themes, plugins, or core code to the WordPress project. These recent events really make it seem like you’re no longer welcome to contribute to WordPress if you question Matt Mullenweg. ↫ Gavin Anderegg I haven&#8217;t wasted a single word on the ongoing WordPress drama yet, but the longer Matt Mullenweg, Automattic&#8217;s CEO and thus owner of WordPress, keeps losing his mind, I can&#8217;t really ignore the matter any more. OSNews runs, after all, on WordPress &#8211; self-hosted, at least, so not on Mullenweg&#8217;s WordPress.com &#8211; and if things keep going the way they are, I simply don&#8217;t know if WordPress remains a viable, safe, and future-proof CMS for OSNews. I haven&#8217;t discussed this particular situation with OSNews owner, David Adams, yet, mostly since he&#8217;s quite hands-off in the day-to-day operations and has more than enough other matters to take care of, but I think the time has come to start planning for a potential worst-case scenario in which Mullenweg takes even more of whatever he&#8217;s taking and WordPress implodes entirely. Remember &#8211; even if you self-host WordPress outside of Automattic, several core infrastructure parts of WordPress still run through Automattic, so we&#8217;re still dependent on what Mullenweg does or doesn&#8217;t do. I have no answers, announcements, or even plans at this point, but if you or your company depend on WordPress, you might want to start thinking about where to go from here.

Following the historic year of 1969 that saw two successful Moon landings, 1970 opened on a more sober note. Ever-tightening federal budgets forced NASA to rescope its future lunar landing plans. The need for a Saturn V to launch an experimental space station in 1972 forced the cancellation of the final Moon landing mission and [&#8230;]

## The history and use of /etc/glob in early Unixes

date: 2025-01-13, from: OS News

One of the innovations that the V7 Bourne shell introduced was built in shell wildcard globbing, which is to say expanding things like *, ?, and so on. Of course Unix had shell wildcards well before V7, but in V6 and earlier, the shell didn&#8217;t implement globbing itself; instead this was delegated to an external program, /etc/glob (this affects things like looking into the history of Unix shell wildcards, because you have to know to look at the glob source, not the shell). ↫ Chris Siebenmann I never knew expanding wildcars in UNIX shells was once done by a separate program, but if you stop and think about the original UNIX philosophy, it kind of makes sense. On a slightly related note, I&#8217;m currently very deep into setting up, playing with, and actively using HP-UX 11i v1 on the HP c8000 I was able to buy thanks to countless donations from you all, OSNews readers, and one of the things I want to get working is email in dtmail, the CDE email program. However, dtmail is old, and wants you to do email the UNIX way: instead of dtmail retrieving and sending email itself, it expects other programs to those tasks for you. In other words, to setup and use dtmail (instead of relying on a 2010 port of Thunderbird), I&#8217;ll have to learn how to set up things like sendmail, fetchmail, or alternatives to those tools. Those programs will in turn dump the emails in the maildir format for dtmail to work with. Configuring these tools could very well be above my paygrade, but I&#8217;ll do my best to try and get it working &#8211; I think it&#8217;s more authentic to use something like dtmail than a random Thunderbird port. In any event, this, too, feels very UNIX-y, much like delegating wildcard expansion to a separate program. What this also shows is that the &#8220;UNIX philosophy&#8221; was subject to erosion from the very beginning, and really isn&#8217;t a modern phenomenon like many people seem to imply. I doubt many of the people complaining about the demise of the UNIX philosophy today even knew wildcard expansion used to be done by a separate program.
