## US airspace closures, lack of answers deepen East Coast drone mystery

<h4>Feds insist they still don&#39;t know what&#39;s happening – but note sightings cluster around airport flight paths</h4> <p><strong>Analysis</strong>  Mystery drone fever continues to grip the US East Coast – and appears to be moving inland – as elected officials beg the federal government to do something.

## Microsoft Recall screenshots credit cards and Social Security numbers, even with the “sensitive information” filter enabled

date: 2024-12-16, from: OS News

Microsoft’s Recall feature recently made its way back to Windows Insiders after having been pulled from test builds back in June, due to security and privacy concerns. The new version of Recall encrypts the screens it captures and, by default, it has a “Filter sensitive information,” setting enabled, which is supposed to prevent it from recording any app or website that is showing credit card numbers, social security numbers, or other important financial / personal info. In my tests, however, this filter only worked in some situations (on two e-commerce sites), leaving a gaping hole in the protection it promises. ↫ Avram Piltch at Tom&#8217;s Hardware Recall might be one of the biggest own goals I have seen in recent technology history. In fact, it&#8217;s more of a series of own goals that just keep on coming, and I honestly have no idea why Microsoft keeps making them, other than the fact that they&#8217;re so high on their own &#8220;AI&#8221; supply that they just lost all touch with reality at this point. There&#8217;s some serious Longhorn-esque tunnel vision here, a project during which the company also kind of forgot the outside world existed beyond the walls of Microsoft&#8217;s Redmond headquarters. It&#8217;s clear by now that just like many other tech companies, Microsoft is so utterly convinced it needs to shove &#8220;AI&#8221; into every corner of its products, that it no longer seems to be asking the most important question during product development: do people actually want this? The response to Windows Recall has been particularly negative, yet Microsoft keep pushing and pushing it, making all the mistakes along the way everybody has warned them about. It&#8217;s astonishing just how dedicated they are to a feature nobody seem to want, and everybody seems to warn them about. It&#8217;s like we&#8217;re all Kassandra. The issue in question here is exactly as dumb as you expect it to be. The &#8220;Filter sensitive information&#8221; setting is so absurdly basic and dumb it basically only seems to work on shopping sites, not anywhere else where credit card or other sensitive information might be shown. This shortcoming is obvious to anyone who think about what Recall does for more than one nanosecond, but Microsoft clearly didn&#8217;t take a few moments to think about this, because their response is to let them know through the Feedback Hub any time Recall fails to detect and sensitive information. They&#8217;re basically asking you, the consumer, to be the filter. Unpaid, of course. After the damage has already been done. Wild. If you can ditch Windows, you should. Windows is not a place of honour.

## Fedora’s new Btrfs SIG should focus on making Btrfs’ features more accessible

date: 2024-12-16, from: OS News

As Michel Lind mentioned back in August, we wanted to form a Special Interest Group to further the development and adoption of Btrfs in Fedora. As of yesterday, the SIG is now formed. ↫ Neal Gompa Since I&#8217;ve been using Fedora on all my machines for a while now, I&#8217;ve also been using Btrfs as my one and only file system for just as much time, without ever experiencing any issues. In fact, I recently ordered four used 4TB enterprise hard drives (used, yes, but zero SMART issues) to set up a storage pool whereto I can download my favourite YouTube playlists so I don&#8217;t have to rely on internet connectivity and YouTube not being shit. I combined the four drives into a single 16TB Btrfs volume, and it&#8217;s working flawlessly. Of course, not having any redundancy is a terrible idea, but I didn&#8217;t care much since it&#8217;s just downloaded YouTube videos. However, it&#8217;s all working so flawlessly, and the four drives were so cheap, I&#8217;m going to order another four drives and turn the whole thing into a 16TB Btrfs volume using one of the Btrfs RAID profiles for proper redundancy, even if it &#8220;costs&#8221; me half of the 32TB of total storage. This way, I can also use it as an additional backup for more sensitive data, which is never a bad thing. The one big downside here is that all of this has to be set up and configured using the command line. While that makes sense in a server environment and I had no issues doing so, I think a product that calls itself Fedora Workstation (or, in my case, Fedora KDE, but the point stands) should have proper graphical tools for managing the file system it uses. Fedora should come with a graphical utility to set up, manage, and maintain Btrfs volumes, so you don&#8217;t have to memorise a bunch of arcane commands. I know a lot of people get very upset when you even suggest someting like this, but that&#8217;s just elitist nonsense. Btrfs has various incredibly useful features that should be exposed to users of all kinds, not just sysadmins and weird nerds &#8211; and graphical tools are a great way to do this. I don&#8217;t know exactly what the long-term plans of the new Btrrfs SIG are going to be, but I think making the useful features of Btrfs more accessible should definitely be on the list. You shouldn&#8217;t need to be a CLI expert to set up resilient, redundant local storage on your machine, especially now that the interest in digital self-sufficiency is increasing.

## There’s a market out there for a modern X11/Motif-based desktop distribution

date: 2024-12-15, from: OS News

EMWM is a fork of the Motif Window Manager with fixes and enhancements. The idea behind this is to provide compatibility with current xorg extensions and applications, without changing the way the window manager looks and behaves. This includes support for multi-monitor setups through Xinerama/Xrandr, UFT-8 support with Xft fonts, and overall better compatibility with software that requires&#160;Extended Window Manager Hints. Additionally a couple of goodies are available in the separate utilities package:&#160;XmToolbox, a&#160;toolchest&#160;like application launcher, which reads it&#8217;s multi-level menu structure from a simple plain-text file ~/.toolboxrc, and&#160;XmSm, a simple session manager that provides session configuration, locking and shutdown/suspend options. ↫ EMWM homepage I had never heard of EMWM, but I immediately like it. This same developer, Alexander Pampuchin, also develops XFile, a file manager for X11 which presents the file system as it actually is, instead of using a bunch of &#8220;imaginary&#8221; locations to hide the truth, if you will. On top of that, they also develop XImaging, a comprehensive image viewer for X11. All of these use the Motif widget toolkit, focus on plain X11, and run on most Linux distributions and BSDs. They need to be compiled by the user, most likely. I am convinced that there is a small but sustainable audience for a modern, up-to-date Linux distribution (although a BSD would work just as well), that instead of offering GNOME, KDE, Xfce, or whatever, focuses instead of delivering a traditional, yet modernised and maintained, desktop environment and applications using not much more than X11 and Motif, eschewing more complex stuff like GTK, Qt, systemd, Wayland, and so on. I would use the hell out of a system that gives me a version of the Motif-based desktops like CDE from the &#8217;90s, but with some modern amenities, current hardware support, support for high-resolution displays, and so on. You can certainly grab bits and bobs left and right from the web and build something like this from scratch, but not everyone has the skills and time to do so, yet I think there&#8217;s enough people out there who are craving for something like this. There&#8217;s tons of maintained X11/Motif software out there &#8211; it&#8217;s just all spread out, disorganised, and difficult to assemble because it almost always means compiling it all from scratch, and most people simply don&#8217;t have the time and energy for that. Package this up on a solid Debian, Fedora, or FreeBSD base, and I think you&#8217;ve got quite some users lining up.

## Xfce 4.20 with experimental Wayland support released

date: 2024-12-15, from: OS News

After two years of intense development, the third major Linux desktop environment has released a new version: Xfce 4.20 is here. The major focus of this release cycle was getting Xfce ready for Wayland, and they&#8217;ve achieved quite a bit of that goal, but support for it is still experimental. Thanks to&#160;Brian&#160;and&#160;Gaël&#160;almost all Xfce components are able to run on Wayland windowing, while still keeping support for X11 windowing. This major effort was achieved by abstracting away any X11/Wayland windowing specific calls and making use of Wayland/Wlroots protocols. A whole new Xfce library, &#8220;libxfce4windowing&#8221; was introduced during that process. XWayland will not be required to run any of the ported Xfce components. ↫ Xfce development team A major gap in Xfce&#8217;s Wayland support is the fact that Xfwm4 has not been ported to Wayland yet, so the team suggests using Labwc or Wayfire instead if you want to dive into using Xfce on Wayland. While there are plans to port Xfwm4 over to Wayland, this requires a major restructuring and they&#8217;re not going to set any timelines or expectations for when this will be completed. Regardless, this is an excellent achievement and solid progress for Xfce on Wayland, which is pretty much a requirement for Xfce (and other desktop environments) te remain relevant going forward. Of course, while Wayland is a major focus this release, there&#8217;s a lot more here, too &#8211; and that&#8217;s not doing the Xfce developers justice. Xfce 4.20 comes packed with so many new features, enchancements, and bug fixes across the board that I have no idea where to start. I like the large number of changes to Thunar, like the ability to use symoblic icons in the sidebar, optimising it for small window sizes, automatically opening folders when dragging and dropping, and so much more. They&#8217;ve also done another pass to update any remaining icons not working well on HiDPI displays, removing any instances where you&#8217;d encounter fuzzy icons. I can&#8217;t wait to give Xfce 4.20 a go once it lands in Fedora Xfce.
