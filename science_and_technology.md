## Microsoft wants to find out why Windows 11 is so slow

Microsoft wants to know why, exactly, Windows 11 is slow, so it&#8217;s adding a feature in the latest Insider Preview to collect data when a Windows 11 machine is experiencing slowness or sluggishness. As part of our commitment to improving Windows performance, logs are now collected when your PC has experienced any slow or sluggish performance. Windows Insiders are encouraged to provide feedback when experiencing PC issues related to slow or sluggish performance, allowing Feedback Hub to automatically collect these logs, which will help us root cause issues faster. Use the Desktop > System Sluggishness category when filing feedback to allow Feedback Hub to automatically pick up these logs. These logs are stored locally (%systemRoot%\Temp\DiagOutputDir\Whesvc folder) and only sent to Microsoft via Feedback Hub when feedback is submitted. ↫ Amanda Langowski and Brandon LeBlanc In case you want to solve performance problems with Windows 11, just go here and follow the steps, and your computer will be spry as a Spring chicken in a few minutes.

## Mwm: an X11 window manager in 20 lines of code

Is KDE too much for you? GNOME tries to do too much? Xfce still a bit too fancy? Do you need something smaller? Even more minimalist? What about a mere 20 lines of code which provide the absolute barest possible minimum of window management functionality? You need mwm. This is the smallest, actually usable window manager I know about. Even TinyWM is twice as large. However, it doesn&#8217;t let you launch programs, or assign key bindings. mwm does. ↫ Mwm&#8217;s GitHub page It will open a window, and let you switch between windows, that are always fullscreen. No titlebars, no virtual desktops, no menus, no nothing. This is the true minimalist&#8217;s experience.

## An artificially complex XML schema as a lock-in tool

date: 2025-07-21, from: OS News

The Document Foundation, which developers LibreOffice, is mad at Microsoft for the levels of complexity in the Microsoft 365 document format. They claim Microsoft intentionally makes this format&#8217;s XML schema as complex and obtuse as possible to lock users into the Microsoft Office ecosystem. This artificial complexity is characterised by a deeply nested tag structure with excessive abstraction, dozens or even hundreds of optional or overloaded elements, non-intuitive naming conventions, the widespread use of extension points and wildcards, the multiple import of namespaces and type hierarchies, and sparse or cryptic documentation. In the case of the Microsoft 365 document format, the only characteristic not present is sparse or cryptic documentation, given that we are talking about a set of documents totalling over 8,000 pages. All the other characteristics are present to a greater or lesser extent, making life almost impossible for a developer trying to implement the schema. ↫ Italo Vignoli I feel like this was widely known already, since I distinctly remember the discussions around the standardisation process for the Office Open XML file formats. Then, too, it was claimed that Microsoft&#8217;s then-new XML file formats were far more complex and obtuse than the existing, already standardised OpenDocument file formats, and that there was no need to push Microsoft&#8217;s new file formats through the process. These days, you might wonder how relevant all of this still is, but considering vast swaths of the private, corporate, government, and academic world still run on Microsoft Office and its default file formats, it&#8217;s definitely still a hugely relevant matter. As an office suite, you are basically required to support Office Open XML, and if Microsoft is making that more complex and obtuse on purpose, that&#8217;s a form of monopoly abuse that should be addressed.

date: 2025-07-20, from: OS News

The year before his death in 1994,&#160;Gary Kildall—inventor&#160;of the early microcomputer operating system CP/M—wrote a draft of a memoir, “Computer Connections: People, Places, and Events in the Evolution of the Personal Computer Industry.” He distributed copies to family and friends, but died before realizing his plans to release it as a book. This week, the&#160;Computer History&#160;Museum in Mountain View, with the permission of Kildall’s children, released the&#160;first portion of that memoir. You can download it&#160;here. ↫ Tekla S. Perry at IEEE Spectrum Invaluable writing, and I&#8217;m so glad it&#8217;s getting published.
