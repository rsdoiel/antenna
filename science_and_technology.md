## OpenBSD gets CDE

date: 2025-07-30, from: OS News

Adjusted for the inevitable progress of time, the Common Desktop Environment or CDE is the best desktop environment of all time, and no, I will not be taking question at this time. OpenBSD wasn&#8217;t yet graced by CDE&#8217;s presence, but this is currently changing as the first commit for porting CDE to OpenBSD has appeared. It&#8217;s still rough around the edges and very slightly tested. I wouldn&#8217;t use is as a daily driver, it&#8217;s old unsecure code but it&#8217;s fun if you want to bring back memories. ↫ Antoine at the openbsd-ports mailing list On top of that, this being the initial commit also means there&#8217;s probably bugs and other issues lurking in the code, so caution is definitely advised.

## Microsoft finally standardises CPU usage reporting in Task Manager

date: 2025-07-30, from: OS News

Microsoft is finally changing the way Task Manager reports CPU utilisation to make it consistent across the different tabs. So apparently this has been gradually rolling out to the 34 different Windows 11 beta dev preview testing alpha release candidate service pack 4 channels since early this year, but then stopped the roll-out to fix some issues. These issues seem fixed now, as the roll-out restarted this week. It&#8221;s an important change that I think y&#8217;all will care about. From the original announcement of the change back in February: We are beginning to roll out a change to the way Task Manager calculates CPU utilization for the Processes, Performance, and Users pages. Task Manager will now use the standard metrics to display CPU workload consistently across all pages and aligning with industry standards and third-party tools. For backward compatibility, a new optional column called CPU Utility is available (hidden by default) on the Details tab showing the previous CPU value used on the Processes page. ↫ Amanda Langowski and Brandon LeBlanc at the Windows Blogs Before this change, Task Manager&#8217;s Processes tab didn&#8217;t take the number of processor cores into account when calculating PCU usage, so you could see a process at 100% CPU usage even if it was only using one core. These new changes standardise CPU usage reporting across all tabs, taking the number of CPU cores into account properly. Rejoice.

## Why RISC-V Linux needs everyone upstream

date: 2025-07-30, from: OS News

RISC-V has been supported in the upstream Linux kernel since 2017. But without a common hardware baseline, ensuring compatibility across builds and distros hasn’t been easy. The ecosystem was in need of a compelling, clearly defined hardware target – something both software and hardware teams could rally around to produce silicon capable of running stable, enterprise-grade software. This target arrived in October 2024 with the ratification of the application-class RVA23 Profile – RISC-V-speak for a baseline configuration, similar to microarchitecture feature levels in x86. The culmination of years of progress, RVA23 brings together the work done to shape the ISA and standardize key extensions such as vector, bit manipulation and hypervisor. ↫ James De Vile at RISC-V International&#8217;s blog Such a standard, stable baseline is incredibly welcome, and RISC-V working to have everything part of the upstream Linux kernel is crucial. Having to deal with out-of-tree patches and drivers and specific builds for specific boards is a nightmare &#8211; look at Linux on ARM &#8211; and hinders adoption of RISC-V.

## The EU’s age-verification application requires a Google or Apple account and Google-approved Android device or iPhone

date: 2025-07-28, from: OS News

The European Union is in the process of testing an age-verification application, which people can use to verify their age in a privacy-preserving manner (in theory, of course). There&#8217;s countless important discussions to be had about whether or not age verification, privacy-preserving or not, is even something we should want, but that&#8217;s a topic for another time and for people smarter than I. For now, several member states are currently testing the application on a voluntary basis, and the application itself is open source, with the code hosted on GitHub. Aside from the obvious concerns about just how private such an application can even be, and concerns about whether or not we should even want something like this, there&#8217;s another major problem: the application intends to make use of and require application and device verification by using the proprietary tools for such functionality from Google and Apple, built into Android and iOS, respectively. Listed as future &#8220;features&#8221;: App and device verification based on Google Play Integrity API and Apple App Attestation ↫ The application&#8217;s GitHub page This is a massive problem. For reasons that should be obvious to anyone with at least six functioning neurons, the European Union, as well as countless other countries, are trying to reduce their dependency on US technology companies. As such, it&#8217;s indefensible to then require anyone who needs to use age verification in the European Union to use an application that will only work on Google-approved Android devices and even then, only when installed from the Google Play Store, with the only alternative being, of all things, Apple&#8217;s iOS. This means that the EU will require anyone who needs age verification to have either a Google or an Apple account, and can only use Google-approved Android or iOS. This application would not work on, say, GrapheneOS or any other non-Google-approved Android ROM &#8211; in fact, even if you were to compile the application yourself, you wouldn&#8217;t be able to actually use it because it wouldn&#8217;t be installed from the Google Play Store. Of course, any mobile operating other than Android or iOS need not apply either. The danger of tying age verification to Google and Apple did not go by unnoticed, and a GitHub issue raised the issue a few weeks ago. I would like to strongly urge to abandon this plan. Requiring a dependency on American tech giants for age verification further deepens the EU&#8217;s dependency on America and the USA&#8217;s control over the internet. Especially in the current political climate I hope I do not have to explain how undesirable and dangerous that is. ↫ TheLastProject in the GitHub issue The comment thread attached to the issue is long, but during the two weeks since the issue was raised, nobody from the application&#8217;s team has answered or even acknowledged people&#8217;s concerns, which doesn&#8217;t exactly inspire confidence in this being taken seriously. I just hope that with this entire project being in the early testing phases, at least someone manages to realise tying this to Google and Apple is one of the dumbest ideas in a long, long time.

## Samsung removes bootloader unlocking with One UI 8

date: 2025-07-28, from: OS News

Have a Samsung phone (outside of the United States), and want to unlock the bootloader? Well, soon you won&#8217;t be able to do so anymore, as Samsung seems to be removing this option from their phones &#8211; including already sold models being upgraded to One UI 8. Bootloader unlocking is a popular way to breathe new life into older devices, by loading unofficial software onto a device, like custom ROMs, gaining root access, custom kernels, etc. This option will be taken away from users with One UI 8.  This means not only is the OEM Unlock not visible in Settings anymore, but the bootloader doesn’t even contain any of the code required to unlock itself. This means a workaround to brute force it open is not possible at all, unless Samsung updates the bootloader to add this logic back in. ↫ Josh Skinner at SammyGuru And so, the ongoing process of locking down Android to a point where it becomes nigh-on indistinguishable from iOS&#8217; locked-down, anti-user nature continues unabated. Samsung is the default choice for Android users in a lot of places around the world, and seeing them, too move ever closer to fully locking down their phones is terrible news for consumers. We should be striving for less restrictive computing, not more. Combined with persistent rumours that Google is looking into effectively taking Android closed source, leaving only a stub AOSP behind, the future of Android as an least somewhat &#8220;open&#8221; platform looks quite grim indeed.
