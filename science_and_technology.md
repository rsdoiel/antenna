## NASA Tech Developed for Home Health Monitoring

## The insanity of being a software engineer

date: 2025-04-07, from: OS News

Software gets more complicated. All of this complexity is there for a reason. But what happened to specializing? When a house is being built, tons of people are involved: architects, civil engineers, plumbers, electricians, bricklayers, interior designers, roofers, surveyors, pavers, you name it. You don’t expect a single person, or even a whole single company, to be able to do all of those. ↫ Vitor M. de Sousa Pereira I&#8217;ve always found that software development gets a ton of special treatment and leeway in quality expectations, and this has allowed the kind of stuff the linked article is writing about to become the norm. Corporations can demand so much from developers and programmers to the point where expecting quality is wholly unreasonable, because there&#8217;s basically no consequences for delivering a shit product. Bugs, crashes, security issues, lack of documentation, horrid localisation &#8211; it&#8217;s all par for the course in software, yet we would not tolerate any of that in almost any other type of product. While I&#8217;m sure some of this can be attributed to developers themselves, most of it seems to stem from incompetent managers imposing impossible deadlines downwards and setting unrealistic expectations upwards &#8211; you know, kick down, lick up &#8211; creating a perfect storm of incompetence. We all know it, we all experience it every day, and we all hate it &#8211; but we&#8217;ve just accepted it. As consumers, as developers, as regulatory bodies. It&#8217;s too late to fix this now. Software development will forever exist as a sort of no man&#8217;s land of quality expectations, free from regulations, warranties, and consumer protections, and imposing them now after the fact is never going to be accepted by the industry and won&#8217;t ever make it through any lawmaking process of any country, and we all suffer from it, both as users of software and as makers of it.

## Apple’s Darwin OS and XNU kernel deep dive

date: 2025-04-07, from: OS News

Apple’s Darwin operating system is the Unix-like core underpinning macOS, iOS, and all of Apple’s modern OS platforms. At its heart lies the XNU kernel – an acronym humorously standing for “X is Not Unix.” XNU is a unique hybrid kernel that combines a Mach microkernel core with components of BSD Unix. This design inherits the rich legacy of Mach (originating from 1980s microkernel research) and the robust stability and POSIX compliance of BSD. The result is a kernel architecture that balances modularity and performance by blending microkernel message-passing techniques with a monolithic Unix kernel structure. We’ll go through a chronological exploration of Darwin and XNU’s evolution – from Mach and BSD origins to the modern kernel features in macOS on Apple Silicon and iOS on iPhones. We’ll follow this with a deep dive into the architectural milestones, analyze XNU’s internal design (Mach-BSD interaction, IPC, scheduling, memory management, virtualization), and examine how the kernel and key user-space components have adapted to new devices and requirements over time. ↫ Tanuj Ravi Rao Despite its popularity and open source kernel, it&#8217;s quite rare to see detailed deep-dives into the underpinnings of macOS. It always surprised me that nobody took whatever Apple threw across the fence every macOS release and ran with it &#8211; much further than &#8220;run existing open source desktops but worse&#8221; we never got when it comes to Darwin distributions (although this might change) &#8211; so perhaps having more approachable articles like these out and about get people interested.

## Connected Learning Ecosystems: Educators Gather to Empower Learners and Themselves

Many educators would agree that despite working and communicating with dozens, even hundreds, of people each year, the role can feel isolating.

How will it ultimately impact their lives and […]

## Getting the firmware of a VTech/LeapFrog LeapStart/Magibook

date: 2025-04-07, from: OS News

This is a very small blog post about my first reverse engineering project, in which I don&#8217;t really reverse engineer anything yet, but I am just getting started! A family member asked me to add additional book data to the LeapStart he bought for his son, this is the starting point here. ↫ leloubil&#8217;s blog We&#8217;ve all seen toy, child-focused computers like these, and I always find them deeply fascinating. I&#8217;m not buying them for my own kids &#8211; they&#8217;ll get their start on a &#8220;real&#8221; computer I&#8217;ll set up for them to explore and break &#8211; but I see their value, and they&#8217;re probably a better choice than giving a kid a tablet or whatever (which my wife and I are opposed to for our kids). What fascinates me about them is, of course, what software, and more specifically, what operating system they run. It turns out this one most likely runs on something called µC/OS-II, one of the many relatively obscure embedded operating systems you never hear about. µC/OS is a full-featured embedded operating system originally developed by Micriµm. In addition to the two highly popular kernels, µC/OS features support for TCP/IP, USB-Device, USB-Host, and Modbus, as well as a robust File System. ↫ µC/OS GitHub page The documentation provides a lot more detail about its capabilities, so if you&#8217;re interested in learning more, that&#8217;s your starting point.
