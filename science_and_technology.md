## Google confirms it’s merging ChromeOS and Android

Late last year, Mishaal Rahman reported that Google was going to merge ChromeOS and Android, and it seems Google itself has now confirmed that&#8217;s exactly what&#8217;s happening. “I asked because we’re going to be combining ChromeOS and Android into a single platform, and I am very interested in how people are using their laptops these days and what they’re getting done,” Samat explained. ↫ Lance Ulanoff at TechRadar I&#8217;m definitely interested to see what using Android across desktops, laptops, tablets, martphones, and smartwatches is going to be like. The same applications on all those form factors? So many have tried, and as many have failed. I just don&#8217;t think Google has what it takes.

## Blender 5.0 to introduce HDR support for Wayland on Linux, but not for Windows

date: 2025-07-14, from: OS News

The latest alpha of the upcoming Blender 5.0 release comes with&#160;High Dynamic Range (HDR) support for Linux on Wayland&#160;which will, if everything works out, make it into the final Blender 5.0 release on October 1, 2025. The post on the developer forum comes with instructions on how to enable the experimental support and how to test it. If you are using Fedora Workstation 42, which ships GNOME version 48, everything is already included to run Blender with HDR. All that is required is an HDR compatible display and graphics driver, and turning on HDR in the Display Settings. ↫ Sebastian Wick It&#8217;s interesting to note that Blender on Windows won&#8217;t be getting HDR support, and that&#8217;s because Windows&#8217; HDR support is subpar compared to Wayland on Linux, and requires a ton more work which the Blender team isn&#8217;t going to do. It seems the Wayland developers made all the right choices when it comes to HDR support. Needless to say, X11 doesn&#8217;t have HDR support. The design of the Wayland color-management protocol, and the resulting active color-management paradigm of Wayland compositors was a good choice, making it easy for developers to do the right thing, while also giving them more control if they so chose. ↫ Sebastian Wick Weird. I was told Wayland was an unusable mess.

## Does showing seconds in the Windows System Tray actually use more power?

date: 2025-07-14, from: OS News

On Windows, there&#8217;s an option to show the seconds on the taskbar clock, but it comes with a warning that it might reduce battery life if you switch it on. LTT Labs decided to look into this to see just how much of a thing this really is, and they concluded that yes, it does actually affect battery life. They saw a drop of about 5%-15%, depending on configuration. In percentage terms, the drops weren’t massive. For most people, it probably won’t make or break your day. But if you’re on a long flight, running low on battery, or trying to squeeze out every last bit of endurance, it’s not entirely nothing either. ↫ Woolly Door at LTT Labs I mean, having the second tick away on the click would drive me up the wall when I&#8217;m trying to use my computer, but I&#8217;m sure quite a few among you do enable the seconds display on your own setups (Windows or otherwise). I&#8217;m curious to see if the same battery life reduction is measurable on KDE, GNOME, or macOS.

## wlmaker: Wayland compositor that reproduces Window Maker’s look and feel

What if you want to use Wayland, but prefer Window Maker, which is restricted to legacy X11? Enter wlmaker, or Wayland Maker, a Wayland compositor that reproduces the look and feel of Window Maker. It&#8217;s lightweight, very configurable through human-readable configuration files, supports dockable applications, and more. It&#8217;s actually packaged in FreeBSD and a number of Linux distributions, including Ubuntu and Debian (Fedora&#8217;s package is outdated), but of course, you can compile it yourself, too.

## Anubis, tool to stop “AI” crawler abuse, gains non-JavaScript option

date: 2025-07-14, from: OS News

In recent weeks and months, you may have noticed that when accessing some websites, you see a little progress bar and a character, performing some sort of check. You&#8217;ve most likely encountered Anubis, a tool to distinguish real human browser users from &#8220;AI&#8221; content crawlers that are causing real damage and harm. It turns out Anubis is quite effective at what it does, but it did come with a limitation: it required JavaScript to be enabled. Well, no more. One of the first issues in Anubis before it was moved to the TecharoHQ org was a request to support challenging browsers without using JavaScript. This is a pretty challenging thing to do without rethinking how Anubis works from a fundamentally low level, and with v1.20.0, Anubis finally has support for running without client-side JavaScript thanks to the Meta Refresh challenge. ↫ Xe Iaso Before this new non-JS challenge, users who disabled client-side JavaScript or browsers which don&#8217;t support JavaScript were straight-up blocked from passing Anubis&#8217; test, meaning they couldn&#8217;t access the website Anubis was protecting from &#8220;AI&#8221; scraper abuse. This is now no longer the case.
