## Linux Mint forks GNOME’s Libadwaita to add theme support

date: 2025-05-22, from: OS News

On numerous occasions, we&#8217;ve talked about the issue facing non-GNOME GTK desktops, like Xfce, MATE, and Cinnamon: the popularity of Libadwaita. With more and more application developers opting for GNOME&#8217;s Libadwaita because of the desktop environment&#8217;s popularity, many popular GTK applications now look like GNOME applications instead of GTK applications, and they just don&#8217;t mesh well with traditional GTK desktops. Since Libadwaita is not themeable, applications that use it can&#8217;t really be made to feel at home on non-GNOME GTK desktops, unless said desktops adopt the entire GNOME design language, handing over control ovr their GUI design to outsiders in the process. The developers of Libadwaita, as well as the people behind GNOME, have made it very clear they do not intend to make Libadwaita themeable, and they are well within their rights to make that decision. I think it&#8217;s a bad decision &#8211; themeing is a crucial accessibility feature &#8211; but it&#8217;s their project, their code, and their time, and I fully respect their decision, since it&#8217;s really not up to GNOME to worry about the other GTK desktops. So, what are the developers of Xfce, MATE, and Cinnamon supposed to do? Well, how about taking matters into their own hands? Clement Lefebvre, the lead developer of Linux Mint and its Cinnamon desktop environment, has soft-forked Libadwaita to add theme support to the library. They&#8217;re calling it LibAdapta. libAdapta is libAdwaita with theme support and a few extra. It provides the same features and the same look as libAdwaita by default. In desktop environments which provide theme selection, libAdapta apps follow the theme and use the proper window controls. ↫ LibAdapta&#8217;s GitHub page The reason they consider libAdapta a &#8220;soft-fork&#8221; is that all it does is add theme support; they do not intended to deviate from Libadwaita in any other way, and will follow Libadwaita&#8217;s releases. It will use the current GTK3 theme, and will fallback to the default Libadwaita look and feel if the GTK3 theme in question doesn&#8217;t have a libadapta-1.0 directory. This seems like a transparent and smart way to handle it. I doubt it will be long before libAdapta becomes a default part of a lot of user instructions online, GTK theme developers will probably add support for it pretty quickly, and perhaps even of a lot of non-GNOME GTK desktop environments will add it by default. It will make it a lot easier for, say, the developers of MATE to make use of the latest Libadwaita applications, without having to either accept a disjointed, inconsistent user experience, or adopt the GNOME design language hook, line, and sinker and lose all control over the user experience they wish to offer to their users. I&#8217;m glad this exists now, and hope it will prove to be popular. I appreciate the pragmatic approach taken here &#8211; a relatively simple fork that doesn&#8217;t burden upstream, without long feature request threads where everybody is shouting at each other that needlessly spill over onto Fedi. This is how open source is supposed to work.

## GhostBSD: from usability to struggle and renewal

date: 2025-05-22, from: OS News

This article isn’t meant to be technical. Instead, it offers a high-level view of what happened through the years with GhostBSD, where the project stands today, and where we want to take it next. As you may know, GhostBSD is a user-friendly desktop BSD operating system built with FreeBSD. Its mission is to deliver a simple, stable, and accessible desktop experience for users who want FreeBSD’s power without the complexity of manual setup. I started this journey as a non-technical user. I dreamed of a BSD that anyone could use. ↫ Eric Turgeon at the FreeBSD Foundation&#8217;s website I&#8217;m very glad to see this article published on the website of the FreeBSD Foundation. I firmly believe that especially FreeBSD has all the components to become an excellent desktop alternative to desktop Linux distributions, especially now that the Linux world is moving fast with certain features and components not everyone likes. FreeBSD could serve as a valid alternative. GhostBSD plays an important role in this. It offers not just an easily installable FreeBSD desktop, but also several tools to make managing such an installation easier, like in-house graphical user interfaces for managing Wi-Fi and other networks, backups, updates, installing software, and more. They also recently moved from UFS to ZFS, and intend to develop graphical tools to expose ZFS&#8217;s features to users. GhostBSD can always use more contributors, so if you have the skills, interest, and time, do give it a go.

## Jwno: a highly customisable tiling WM for Windows built with Janet

date: 2025-05-20, from: OS News

Jwno is a highly customizable tiling window manager for Windows 10/11, built with Janet and ❤️. It brings to your desktop magical parentheses power, which, I assure you, is not suspicious at all, and totally controllable. ↫ Jwno documentation Yes, it&#8217;s a Lisp system, so open your bag of spare parentheses and start configuring and customising it, because you&#8217;re going to need it if you want to use Jwno to its fullest. In general, Jwno works as a keyboard driven tiling window manager. When a new window shows up, it tries to transform the window so it fits in the layout you defined. You can then use customized key bindings to modify the layout or manipulate your windows, rather than drag things around using the mouse. But, since a powerful generic scripting engine is built-in, you can literally do anything with it. ↫ Jwno documentation It&#8217;s incredibly lightweight, comes as a single executable, integrates perfectly with Windows&#8217; native virtual desktop and window management features, has support for REPL, and much more.

## Making video games in 2025 (without an engine)

date: 2025-05-20, from: OS News

I genuinely believe making games without a big &#8220;do everything&#8221; engine can be easier, more fun, and often less overhead. I am not making a &#8220;do everything&#8221; game and I do not need 90% of the features these engines provide. I am very particular about how my games feel and look, and how I interact with my tools. I often find the default feature implementations in large engines like Unity so lacking I end up writing my own anyway. Eventually, my projects end up being mostly my own tools and systems, and the engine becomes just a vehicle for a nice UI and some rendering&#8230; At which point, why am I using this engine? What is it providing me? Why am I letting a tool potentially destroy my ability to work when they suddenly make unethical and terrible business decisions? Or push out an update that they require to run my game on consoles, that also happens to break an entire system in my game, forcing me to rewrite it? Why am I fighting this thing daily for what essentially becomes a glorified asset loader and editor UI framework, by the time I&#8217;m done working around their default systems? ↫ Noel Berry Interesting and definitely unique perspective, as I feel most game developers just pick one of the existing big engines and work from there. I&#8217;m not saying either option is wrong, but I do feel like the dependence on the popular engines can potentially harm the game industry as a whole, as it reduced diversity, drains valuable knowledge and expertise, and leaves developers &#8211; especially smaller ones &#8211; at the mercy of a few big players. Perhaps not every game needs to be made in Unity or Unreal.

## On the relationship between Qt and KDE

date: 2025-05-20, from: OS News

Volker Hilsheimer, chief maintainer of the Qt project, says he has learned lessons from the painful Qt 5 to Qt 6 transition, the importance of Qt Bridges for using Qt from any language, and the significance of the relationship with the Linux KDE desktop. ↫ Tim Anderson at Dev Class Qt plays a significant role in the open source desktop world in particular, because it&#8217;s the framework KDE uses. Hilsheimer notes that KDE&#8217;s role in the Qt community is actually quite important, because not only is it a source of people learning how to use Qt and who can thus make contributions to the project, KDE also tends to use the latest Qt versions, creating a lot of confidence among the wider Qt community to also adopt the latest versions. The relationship with KDE and Qt is an interesting one, and sometimes leads to questions about the future availability of the open source edition of Qt since the Qt Company licenses Qt under a dual-license structure (both open and proprietary). To avoid any uncertainty, KDE and Qt have an agreement that covers pretty much every possible scenario and which is worded to ensure the availability of Qt as an open source framework. KDE, through the KDE Free Qt Foundation, has a number rights and options to ensure the availability of Qt as an open source framework. I&#8217;m no lawyer, so I might get some of the details wrong, but the main points are that if the Qt Company ever decides to discontinue the open source edition of Qt, the KDE Free Qt Foundation has the right to release Qt under a BSD-style license within 12 months. The same applies to any addition to Qt which are not released as open source; they must be released under an open source license within 12 months of initial release. This agreement remains valid in the case of buyouts, mergers, or bankruptcies. This agreement has existed in one form or another since the late &#8217;90s, and has survived Qt being owned by Nokia and Digia, as well as various other organisational changes. Despite the issue of Qt&#8217;s ownership coming up every now and then, the agreement is pretty airtight, and considering its longevity there&#8217;s no reason to be worried about it at all. Still, this structure is clearly more complex and less straightforward than, say, the status of GTK and its relationship to GNOME, so it&#8217;s not entirely unreasonable the issue comes up every now and then. I wonder if we&#8217;ll ever see this situation become less complex, without the need for special agreements. While it wouldn&#8217;t make a practical difference, it would make things less&#8230; Legalese.

## Telum II at Hot Chips 2024: mainframe with a unique caching strategy

date: 2025-05-19, from: OS News

Mainframes still play a vital role in today, providing extremely high uptime and low latency for financial transactions. Telum II is IBM’s latest mainframe processor, and is designed unlike any other server CPU. It only has eight cores, but runs them at a very high 5.5 GHz and feeds them with 360 MB of on-chip cache. IBM also includes a DPU for accelerating IO, along with an on-board AI accelerator. Telum II is implemented on Samsung’s leading edge 5 nm process node. IBM’s presentation has already been covered by other outlets. Therefore I’ll focus on what I feel like is Telum (II)’s most interesting features. DRAM latency and bandwidth limitations often mean good caching is critical to performance, and IBM has a often deployed interesting caching solutions. Telum II is no exception, carrying forward a virtual L3 and virtual L4 strategy from prior IBM chips. ↫ Chester Lam at Chips and Cheese If you&#8217;ve been keeping track, you can possibly deduce that I&#8217;m bit of a sucker for IBM&#8217;s mainframes and big POWER machines. These Telum II processors are absolutely wild.

## Two weeks with AR glasses and Linux on Android

date: 2025-05-19, from: OS News

I recently learned something that blew my mind; you can run a full desktop Linux environment on your phone.  That&#8217;s a graphical environment via X11 with real window management and compositing, Firefox comfortably playing YouTube (including working audio), and a status bar with system stats. It launches in less than a second and feels snappy. ↫ Hold the Robot In and of itself, this is a neat trick most of us are probably aware of. Running a full Linux distribution on an Android phone using chroot is an awesome party trick, but I doubt many people take this concept to its logical conclusion by connecting it up to a display, keyboard, and mouse, and use it as their mobile workstation. Well, the author of this article did, and he took it even one step further by replacing the display part of the logical conclusion with AR glasses. The AR glasses in question were a pair of Xreal Air 2 Pro, which put a 120Hz 1080p display in front of your eyes using Sony micro-OLED panels. This will create the illusion of a 130&#8243; screen with a 46° field of view, from a pair of glasses that honestly do not feel that much more massive than regular sunglasses or some of the thicker glasses frames some people like. I&#8217;m honestly kind of impressed this is possible these days. Add in a keyboard and mouse, and you&#8217;ve got a mobile workstation that takes up very little space, especially since you&#8217;re carrying your phone with you at all times anyway. Of course, you have to be comfortable with using Linux &#8211; no Windows or macOS here &#8211; and the software side of the equation requires more setup and fiddling than I thought it would, but the end result is exactly like using a regular Linux desktop, but on your phone and a pair of AR glasses instead of on a laptop or desktop. If I had the cash to throw around on fun side projects like this (you can help with that, actually, through Ko-Fi donations), I would totally order a pair of these Xreal glasses to try this out.

## Microsoft releases WSL as open source, announces CLI text editor to replace the MS-DOS Editor

date: 2025-05-19, from: OS News

Today we’re very excited to announce the open-source release of the Windows Subsystem for Linux. This is the result of a multiyear effort to prepare for this, and a great closure to the first ever issue raised on the Microsoft/WSL repo: Will this be Open Source? · Issue #1 · microsoft/WSL. That means that the code that powers WSL is now available on GitHub at Microsoft/WSL and open sourced to the community! You can download WSL and build it from source, add new fixes and features and participate in WSL’s active development. ↫ Pierre Boulay at the Windows Blogs Windows Subsystem for Linux seems like a relatively popular choice for people who want a modern, Linux-based development environment but are stuck using Windows. I&#8217;m happy to see Microsoft releasing it as open source, which is no longer something to be surprised by at this point in time. It leaves one to wonder how long it&#8217;s going to be before more parts of Windows will be released as open source, since it could allow Microsoft&#8217;s leadership to justify some serious job cuts. I honestly have no idea how close to the real thing Windows Subsystem for Linux is, and if it can actually fully replace a proper Linux installation, with all the functionality and performance that entails. I&#8217;m no developer, have no interest in Windows, so I&#8217;ve never actually tried it. I&#8217;d love to hear some experiences from all of you. Aside from releasing WSL as open source, Microsoft also released a new command-line text editor &#8211; simply called Edit. It&#8217;s also open source, in its early stages, and is basically the equivalent of Nano. It turns out 32bit versions of Windows up until Windows 10 still shipped with the MS-DOS Editor, but obviously that one needed a replacement. It already has support for multiple documents, mouse support, and a few more basic features.

## With how user-hostile Windows and macOS are, is it any wonder people long for computers from the ’80s and ’90s?

date: 2025-05-19, from: OS News

Every so often people yearn for a lost (1980s or so) era of &#8216;single user computers&#8217;, whether these are simple personal computers or high end things like Lisp machines and Smalltalk workstations. It&#8217;s my view that the whole idea of a 1980s style &#8220;single user computer&#8221; is not what we actually want and has some significant flaws in practice. ↫ Chris Siebenmann I think the premise of this entire article is flawed, and borders on being a strawman argument. I honestly don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s many people out there who genuinely and seriously want to use an &#8217;80s home computer for all their computing tasks, but this article seems to think that there are. Virtually every single person expressing interest in and a desire for classic computers does so from a point of nostalgia, as a learning experience, or as a hobby. They&#8217;re definitely not interested in using any of those &#8217;80s machine to do their banking or to collaborate with their colleagues. Additionally, the problems and issues people have with modern computing platforms is not that they are too complex, but that they are no longer designed with the user in mind. Windows, macOS, iOS; they&#8217;re all first and foremost designed to extract money from you through ads, upsells, nag screens, and similar anti-user features, and it&#8217;s those things that people are sick of. Coincidentally, they are all things we didn&#8217;t have to deal with back in the &#8217;80s and &#8217;90s. In other words, remove the user-hostility from modern operating systems, and people wouldn&#8217;t complain about them so much. Which seems rather obvious, doesn&#8217;t it? It&#8217;s why using a Linux desktop like Fedora is such a breath of fresh air. There&#8217;s no upsells for cloud storage or streaming services, no restrictions on what I can and cannot install to protect some multitrillion euro company&#8217;s revenue streams, no ads and nag screens infesting my operating system &#8211; it&#8217;s just an operating system waiting for me to tell it what it do, and then it does it. It&#8217;s wild how increasingly revolutionary that&#8217;s becoming. Whenever I am forced to interact with Windows 11 or whatever the current version of macOS is, I feel such a profound and deep sadness for what they&#8217;ve become, and it seems only natural to me that this sadness is fueling a longing for back when these systems weren&#8217;t so user-hostile.

## Render a Guitar Pro score in real time on Linux

date: 2025-05-19, from: OS News

Tuxguitar is a quite powerful application written in a mixture of Java / C. It is able to render a score in real time either via Fluidsynth or via pure MIDI. The development of Tuxguitar started in 2008 on Sourceforce and after a halt in 2022, the project restarted on Github and is still actively developed. The goal of this article is to try to render a score via Tuxguitar, and various other applications connected to Tuxguitar, via Jack or Pipewire-Jack. The score used throughout this article will be The Pursuit Of Vikings by the band Amon Amarth. It has 2 guitars, a bass and a drum track. ↫ Yann Collette at Fedora Magazine If you&#8217;re into audio production and are considering using Linux for your audio needs, this article is a good starting point.

## What were the MS-DOS programs that the moricons.dll icons were intended for?

date: 2025-05-18, from: OS News

Last time, we looked at the legacy icons in progman.exe. But what about moricons.dll? Here’s a table of the icons that were present in the original Windows 3.1 moricons.dll file (in file order) and the programs that Windows used the icons for. As with the icons in progman.exe, these icons are mapped from executables according to the information in the APPS.INF file. ↫ Raymond Chen These icons age like a fine wine. They&#8217;re clear, well-designed, easy to read, and make extraordinary good use of the limited amount of available pixels. Icons from Mac OS, BeOS, OS/2, and a few others from the same era also look timeless, and I wish modern designers learned a thing or two from these.
