## FreeDOS 1.4 released

date: 2025-04-09, from: OS News

With FreeDOS being, well, DOS, you&#8217;d think there wasn&#8217;t much point in putting out major releases and making big changes, and you&#8217;d mostly be right. However, being a DOS clone doesn&#8217;t mean there isn&#8217;t room for improvement within the confines of the various parts and tools that make up DOS, and that&#8217;s exactly where FreeDOS focuses its attention. FreeDOS 1.4 comes about three years after 1.2. This version includes an updated FreeCOM, Install program, and HTML Help system. This also includes improvements to many of the utilities including FDISK, JEMM, 7Zip, FORMAT, FASM, MORE, RUNTIME, and more! ↫ FreeDOS website If you&#8217;re using FreeDOS, you&#8217;re most likely doing so for a highly specialised task, and racing to upgrade isn&#8217;t exactly high on your list of priorities. Still, it&#8217;s great to see FreeDOS moving forward and improving where it can.

## What’s up with Linux support for Qualcomm X Elite chips?

date: 2025-04-09, from: OS News

Remember when Qualcomm promised Linux would be a first-tier platform alongside Windows for its Snapdragon X Elite, almost a year ago now? Well, the Snapdragon X laptop have been out in the market for a while running Windows, but Linux support is still a complete crapshoot, despite the lofty promises by Qualcomm. Tuxedo, a European Linux OEM who promised to ship a Snapdragon X laptop running Linux, has posted an update on its progress, and it&#8217;s not looking good. While Tuxedo did reach a major milestone last week by sending the laptop&#8217;s device tree to the LKML, that&#8217;s where the good news ends. The next step is to support additional components of the ARM notebook within the device tree. This includes all USB functionalities, including USB4, external monitor connectivity via HDMI, and audio features, such as the headset jack. Additionally, driver testing is on the agenda. Unfortunately, a planned collaboration with Qualcomm, the manufacturer of the Snapdragon X Elite, did not materialize. However, we are in contact with the ARM specialists at Linaro and have sent test devices to them. We hope to receive valuable feedback from their developers and the community in the near future. ↫ Tuxedo&#8217;s website This seems to indicate that Qualcomm isn&#8217;t as interested in Linux support after all, which may be because the Snapdragon X machines haven&#8217;t exactly taken over the laptop market as Microsoft and Qualcomm had hoped. The market for these things is probably not large enough for Qualcomm to justify investing in Linux support, especially when Windows on ARM is apparently not up to snuff yet either. In case you are unaware of why device trees are such a big thing in ARM land, it&#8217;s because ARM devices do not have a nice ACPI table for operating systems to read system information from. Whereas x86 devices have their hardware components laid out in a nice ACPI table in UEFI, ARM devices do not, meaning that the Linux kernel needs to know specifically which device you&#8217;re using so it can load the correct device tree. On x86, this isn&#8217;t necessary, as the Linux kernel can just read the ACPI table, which works 99% of the time to get it to boot, even if specific components might not be supported (yet). On ARM, without a device tree, the Linux kernel doesn&#8217;t know what to do. That&#8217;s one of the major reasons why it&#8217;s so hard for ARM to take off in the same way x86 once did. It&#8217;s just not designed to be infinitely intercompatible and interoperable as we&#8217;ve come to expect from the x86 world, and I don&#8217;t think anybody has any vested interest in changing that. I had hoped Microsoft might throw its weight around here, but it seems that&#8217;s not happening either. The ARM desktop/laptop revolution seems mostly confined to Apple for now.

## The insanity of being a software engineer

date: 2025-04-07, from: OS News

Software gets more complicated. All of this complexity is there for a reason. But what happened to specializing? When a house is being built, tons of people are involved: architects, civil engineers, plumbers, electricians, bricklayers, interior designers, roofers, surveyors, pavers, you name it. You don’t expect a single person, or even a whole single company, to be able to do all of those. ↫ Vitor M. de Sousa Pereira I&#8217;ve always found that software development gets a ton of special treatment and leeway in quality expectations, and this has allowed the kind of stuff the linked article is writing about to become the norm. Corporations can demand so much from developers and programmers to the point where expecting quality is wholly unreasonable, because there&#8217;s basically no consequences for delivering a shit product. Bugs, crashes, security issues, lack of documentation, horrid localisation &#8211; it&#8217;s all par for the course in software, yet we would not tolerate any of that in almost any other type of product. While I&#8217;m sure some of this can be attributed to developers themselves, most of it seems to stem from incompetent managers imposing impossible deadlines downwards and setting unrealistic expectations upwards &#8211; you know, kick down, lick up &#8211; creating a perfect storm of incompetence. We all know it, we all experience it every day, and we all hate it &#8211; but we&#8217;ve just accepted it. As consumers, as developers, as regulatory bodies. It&#8217;s too late to fix this now. Software development will forever exist as a sort of no man&#8217;s land of quality expectations, free from regulations, warranties, and consumer protections, and imposing them now after the fact is never going to be accepted by the industry and won&#8217;t ever make it through any lawmaking process of any country, and we all suffer from it, both as users of software and as makers of it.

## Apple’s Darwin OS and XNU kernel deep dive

date: 2025-04-07, from: OS News

Apple’s Darwin operating system is the Unix-like core underpinning macOS, iOS, and all of Apple’s modern OS platforms. At its heart lies the XNU kernel – an acronym humorously standing for “X is Not Unix.” XNU is a unique hybrid kernel that combines a Mach microkernel core with components of BSD Unix. This design inherits the rich legacy of Mach (originating from 1980s microkernel research) and the robust stability and POSIX compliance of BSD. The result is a kernel architecture that balances modularity and performance by blending microkernel message-passing techniques with a monolithic Unix kernel structure. We’ll go through a chronological exploration of Darwin and XNU’s evolution – from Mach and BSD origins to the modern kernel features in macOS on Apple Silicon and iOS on iPhones. We’ll follow this with a deep dive into the architectural milestones, analyze XNU’s internal design (Mach-BSD interaction, IPC, scheduling, memory management, virtualization), and examine how the kernel and key user-space components have adapted to new devices and requirements over time. ↫ Tanuj Ravi Rao Despite its popularity and open source kernel, it&#8217;s quite rare to see detailed deep-dives into the underpinnings of macOS. It always surprised me that nobody took whatever Apple threw across the fence every macOS release and ran with it &#8211; much further than &#8220;run existing open source desktops but worse&#8221; we never got when it comes to Darwin distributions (although this might change) &#8211; so perhaps having more approachable articles like these out and about get people interested.

## Getting the firmware of a VTech/LeapFrog LeapStart/Magibook

date: 2025-04-07, from: OS News

This is a very small blog post about my first reverse engineering project, in which I don&#8217;t really reverse engineer anything yet, but I am just getting started! A family member asked me to add additional book data to the LeapStart he bought for his son, this is the starting point here. ↫ leloubil&#8217;s blog We&#8217;ve all seen toy, child-focused computers like these, and I always find them deeply fascinating. I&#8217;m not buying them for my own kids &#8211; they&#8217;ll get their start on a &#8220;real&#8221; computer I&#8217;ll set up for them to explore and break &#8211; but I see their value, and they&#8217;re probably a better choice than giving a kid a tablet or whatever (which my wife and I are opposed to for our kids). What fascinates me about them is, of course, what software, and more specifically, what operating system they run. It turns out this one most likely runs on something called µC/OS-II, one of the many relatively obscure embedded operating systems you never hear about. µC/OS is a full-featured embedded operating system originally developed by Micriµm.
