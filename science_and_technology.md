## Google drastically improves quality of the Android Emulator

date: 2024-11-14, from: OS News

One of the things I&#8217;ve consistently heard from just about anyone involved in Android development are laments about the sorry state of the Android Emulator included in Google&#8217;s Android Studio. It seems that particularly its performance is not great, with people often resorting to third-party options or real devices. Well, it seems the Android development team at Google has taken this to heart, and has spent six months focusing almost solely on fixing up the Android Emulator. We know how critical the stability, reliability, and performance of the Android Emulator is to your everyday work as an Android developer. After listening to valuable feedback about stability, reliability, and performance, the Android Studio team took a step back from large feature work on the Android Emulator for six months and started an initiative called Project Quartz. This initiative was made up of several workstreams aimed at reducing crashes, speeding up startup time, closing out bugs, and setting up better ways to detect and prevent issues in the future. ↫ Neville Sicard-Gregory at the Android Developers Blog Steps taken include moving to a newer version of Qt for the user interface of the emulator, improving the graphics rendering system used in the Android Emulator, and adding a whole bunch of tests to their existing test suite. The end result is that the number of crashes in the Android Emulator dropped by 30%, which, if bourne out out in the real world, will have a material impact for Android developers. During the Project Quartz effort, Google also cut the number of open issues by 44%, but they do note only 17% of those were fixed during Project Quartz, with the remainder being obsoleted or previously fixed issues. If you download or update to the latest version of Android Studio, you&#8217;ll get the new and improved Android Emulator as well.

## .NET 9 released

date: 2024-11-13, from: OS News

Today, we are excited to announce the launch of .NET 9, the most productive, modern, secure, intelligent, and performant release of .NET yet. It’s the result of another year of effort on the part of thousands of developers from around the world. This new release includes thousands of performance, security, and functional improvements. You will find sweeping enhancements across the entire .NET stack from the programming languages, developer tools, and workloads enabling you to build with a unified platform and easily infuse your apps with AI. ↫ .NET Team at the .Net Blog All I know is that these are very important words, and a very important release, for thousands and thousands of unknown developers slaving away in obscurity, creating, maintaining, and fixing endless amounts of corporate software very few of us ever actually get to see very often. They toil away for meager pay in the 21st century version of the coal mines of the 19th century, without any recognition, appreciation, or applause. They work long hours, make their way through the urban planning hell that is modern America, and come home to make some gruel and drink water from lead pipes, waiting for the sweet relief of what little sleep they manage to get, only to do it all over again the next day. &#8230;I may have a bit of a skewed perception of reality for most IT people. In all seriousness, .NET is a hugely popular set of tools and frameworks, and while it&#8217;s probably not the most sexy topic in the tech world, any new release matters to a ton of people. .NET 9.0. This new version&#8217;s main focus seems to be performance, with over 1000 performance-related changes tot he various components that make up .NET. In a blog post about these performance improvements, Stephen Toub explains in great detail what some of the improvements are, and where the benefits lie. Of course, there&#8217;s an insane amount of talk about &#8220;AI&#8221; features in .NET 9, and apparently .NET MAUI is seeing a surge in popularity on Android, if you believe Microsoft (&#8220;30$&#8221; increase in &#8220;developer usage&#8221; means little when you don&#8217;t provide a baseline). .NET MAUI is Microsoft&#8217;s cross-platform framework for building applications for Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows. Among other things, .NET MAUI 9 provides more access to platform-native features, as well as benefiting from some of the performance improvements. There&#8217;s also a paragraph about .NET 9 development on Windows, just in case you thought the .NET team forgot Windows existed. With .NET 9, your Windows apps will have access to the latest OS features and capabilities while ensuring they are more performant and accessible than ever before. Whether you are starting a new modern app with WinUI 3 and the Windows App SDK or modernizing your existing WPF and WinForms applications, your Windows apps run best on .NET 9. We have been collaborating closely with the Windows developer community to bring features that you have been requesting. This includes Native AOT support for WinUI 3 for smaller and more performant apps, modern theming enhancements with Fluent UI for WPF, and WinForms gets a boost with a new Dark Mode, modern icon APIs, and improved asynchronous API access with Control.InvokeAsync. ↫ .NET Team at the .Net Blog There&#8217;s way more on top of all of this, from changes to the languages .NET uses to new releases of the various developer tools, like Visual Studio.

## Improving Steam Client stability on Linux: setenv and multithreaded environments

date: 2024-11-12, from: OS News

Speaking of Steam, the Linux version of Valve&#8217;s gaming platform has just received a pretty substantial set of fixes for crashes, and Timothee &#8220;TTimo&#8221; Besset, who works for Valve on Linux support, has published a blog post with more details about what kind of crashes they&#8217;ve been fixing. The&#160;Steam client update on November 5th&#160;mentions &#8220;Fixed some miscellaneous common crashes.&#8221; in the Linux notes, which I wanted to give a bit of background on. There&#8217;s more than one fix that made it in under the somewhat generic header, but the one change that made the most significant impact to Steam client stability on Linux has been a revamping of how we are approaching the&#160;setenv&#160;and&#160;getenv&#160;functions. One of my colleagues rightly dubbed&#160;setenv&#160;&#8220;the worst Linux API&#8221;. It&#8217;s such a simple, common API, available on all platforms that it was a little difficult to convince ourselves just how bad it is. I highly encourage anyone who writes software that will run on Linux at some point to&#160;read through &#8220;RachelByTheBay&#8221;&#8216;s very engaging post&#160;on the subject. ↫ Timothee &#8220;TTimo&#8221; Besset This indeed seems to be a specific Linux problem, and due to the variability in Linux systems &#8211; different distributions, extensive user customisation, and so on &#8211; debugging information was more difficult to parse than on Windows and macOS. After a lot of work grouping the debug information to try and make sense of it all, it turned out that the two functions in question were causing issues in threads other than those that used them. They had to resort to several solutions, from reducing the reliance on setenv and refactoring it with exevpe, to reducing the reliance on getenv through caching, to introducing &#8220;an &#8216;environment manager&#8217; that pre-allocates large enough value buffers at startup for fixed environment variable names, before any threading has started&#8221;. It was especially this last one that had a major impact on reducing the number of crashes with Steam on Linux. Besset does note that these functions are still used far too often, but that at this point it&#8217;s out of their control because that usage comes from the libraries of the operating system, like x11, xcb, dbus, and so on. Besset also mentions that it would be much better if this issue can be addressed in glibc, and in the comments, a user by the name of Adhemerval reports that this is indeed something the glibc team is working on.

## Valve ends Steam’s support for Windows 7 and 8

date: 2024-11-12, from: OS News

Steam has finally stopped working on several older Windows operating systems, following a warning from Valve that it planned to drop support earlier this year. With little fanfare, Windows 7 and Windows 8 gaming on Steam is no longer possible following the most recent Steam client update on November 5. ↫ Ben Stockton at PCGamesN It&#8217;s honestly wild that Valve supported Windows 7 and 8 for this long for Steam in the first place. They&#8217;ve been out of support for a long time, and at this point in time, less than 0.3% of Steam users were using Windows 7 or 8. Investing any resources in continuing to support them would be financially irresponsible, while also aiding a tiny bit in allowing people to use such unsupported, insecure systems to this day. I&#8217;m sure at least one of you is still rocking Windows 7 or 8 as your daily driver operating system, so I&#8217;m sorry if you don&#8217;t want to hear this, but it&#8217;s really, really time to move on. Buying a Windows 10 or 11 license on eBay or whatever costs a few euros at most &#8211; if you&#8217;re not eligible for one the free upgrade programs Microsoft ran &#8211; and especially Windows 10 should run just fine on pretty much anything Windows 7 or 8 runs on. Do note that with Windows 10, though, you&#8217;ll be back in the same boat next year.
