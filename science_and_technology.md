            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-body-with-summary field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Wound infections are common combat injuries and can take otherwise able-bodied personnel out of operations and/or result in severe medical complications. Current standard of care relies on complicated and often time-consuming tests to identify the specific infection-inducing pathogens that caused the wound infection. Therapeutic treatments rely on broad-spectrum and high-dose antibiotics alongside surgical excision – which are not pathogen specific, drive antibiotic resistance, can have toxic side effects, require advanced medical training, and can result in high treatment costs and burden on patients. A game-changing approach to managing infection of combat wounds, particularly one that can be applied autonomously, would benefit warfighter readiness and resilience.</p><p>The BioElectronics to Sense and Treat (BEST) program seeks to meet this need by developing wearable, automated technologies that can predict and prevent a wound infection before it can occur, and to eliminate an infection if it has already taken hold. To achieve this, DARPA is seeking researchers to develop novel bioelectronic smart bandages comprised of wound infection sensor and treatment modules. The sensors should be high-resolution and provide real-time, continual monitoring of wounds based on, for example, the person’s immune state and the collection of bacteria that live in and around a wound. Data from these sensors will be used to predict if a wound will fail to heal due to infection, diagnose the infection, and regulate administration of targeted treatments – using closed-loop control to prevent or resolve infection for improved wound healing.</p><p>“Given that infection initiates at the time of injury and can take hold before aid arrives, particularly in austere environments, the earlier we can deploy these technologies, the bigger impact they will have,” noted <a href="https://drupal.darpa.mil/about/people/leonard-tender">Dr. Leonard Tender, BEST program manager</a>. “Even if medivac occurs immediately, without the ability to prevent infection, the downstream care required to treat the surge of wound infections resulting from a large-scale combat operation could easily overwhelm care capacity.”</p><p>If successful, the BEST program will develop technologies that:</p><ul><li>Adapt to variations in the wound microbial community composition</li><li>Adapt to variations among individuals. Continually update the status of a wound to intervene when needed</li><li>Utilize non-antibiotic treatments to which microbes cannot develop resistance</li><li>Do not interfere with a wound that is predicted to heal on its own</li></ul><p>By the end of the program, the sensor and treatment elements will be combined into a low size, weight, and power closed-loop device that can provide rapid predictions and precise treatments and can be deployed at all aspects of military medical care, including the battlefield. Specific target metrics will be described in the forthcoming BEST program solicitation, which will appear on <a href="https://sam.gov/opp/8698a5251a4f44af896155e4cecba0a5/view" target="_blank">sam.gov </a>and under <a href="https://drupal.darpa.mil/research/opportunities">opportunities on the DARPA website</a>.</p><p>In addition to pursuing the technical objectives, BEST performers will be expected to plan for transition of their approaches and prototypes. This will include developing and executing effective strategies to prepare for regulatory, clinical, and commercialization next steps with the objective of creating opportunities for advanced development and follow-on funding from private and/or government sponsors. Government subject matter experts in these areas will work with the performers to enable success of their projects.</p><p>“Beyond the battlefield, wound infections are a risk to many patients (e.g., those with diabetic foot ulcers). As such, BEST performers will be expected to address relevant military and civilian clinical and market needs in their transition strategies,” added Tender.</p><p>Information is available on the upcoming BEST Proposers Day on <a href="https://sam.gov/opp/8698a5251a4f44af896155e4cecba0a5/view" target="_blank">SAM.gov.</a></p><p class="text-align-center">###</p><p class="text-align-center">Media with inquiries should contact DARPA Public Affairs at <a href="mailto:outreach@darpa.mil" target="_blank">outreach@darpa.mil</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></div>

Specifically, QBI is designed to rigorously verify and validate whether any quantum computing approach can achieve utility-scale operation — meaning its computational value exceeds its cost — by the year 2033.</p><p>Announced in <a href="https://drupal.darpa.mil/news/2024/quantum-computing-prototype">July 2024</a>, QBI builds upon and expands <a href="https://drupal.darpa.mil/research/programs/underexplored-systems-for-utility-scale-quantum-computing">US2QC,</a> and is separate, but related to the <a href="https://drupal.darpa.mil/research/programs/quantum-benchmarking">original Quantum Benchmarking program</a>. Microsoft and PsiQuantum were participating in the second phase of US2QC when the QBI expansion was announced.&nbsp; The final Phase of US2QC has the same technical goals as the final stage of QBI – validation and co-design of an industrially useful quantum computer.</p><p>“Our government evaluation team has been working closely with both companies since the beginning of 2023 to scrutinize their approach to building a utility-scale quantum computer.&nbsp; Both companies have undergone an incredibly rigorous and deeply technical analysis from what is almost certainly the world’s best quantum computing test and evaluation team,” said <a href="https://drupal.darpa.mil/about/people/joe-altepeter">Joe Altepeter, DARPA QBI program manager</a>. “Now, we’re ready to evaluate their final utility-scale system designs, conduct government testing of components and hardware, and assess system-level performance capabilities of major prototypes.”</p><p>The companies have different approaches to their proposed utility-scale quantum computers. Microsoft Corporation, based in Redmond, Washington, is building an error-corrected, utility-scale quantum computer based on a compact superconducting topological qubit architecture, while PsiQuantum, Corp., based in Palo Alto, California, is using silicon-based photonics to create an error-corrected, utility-scale quantum computer based on a lattice-like fabric of photonic qubits. Over 50 experts from DARPA’s test and evaluation team have exhaustively examined both companies’ specific technical approaches, their detailed plans for fault-tolerant prototypes, and their long-term R&amp;D plans, components, architectures, systems development, and application utility.</p><p>Additional quantum computer companies, who submitted initial proposals under the QBI solicitation last summer, are expected to be selected for QBI Stage A soon. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“Since we expanded our quantum computing efforts beyond US2QC with the announcement of QBI last summer, we are very close to selecting additional quantum computing companies whose plans for a utility-scale quantum computer show promise,” Altepeter said. “Early this spring, we anticipate announcing multiple awards to companies who will be entering QBI Stage A, where they will describe their utility-scale quantum computing concepts to an extraordinary test and evaluation team. Stay tuned for news of these selections soon.” &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>For more information on QBI visit: <a href="https://drupal.darpa.mil/research/programs/quantum-benchmarking-initiative">https://www.darpa.mil/qbi</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-body-with-summary field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Wound infections are highly prevalent among combat injuries.&nbsp;</p><p>They can take otherwise ablebodied military personnel out of operations and result in severe medical complications and death.</p><p>The current standard of care for assessing a wound infection relies on identification of the specific infection-inducing microbial pathogens that invaded and colonized the wound via complicated genetic assays or multi-day cell culture approaches, neither of which can be done quickly or simply on the battlefield. The current standard of care for prevention and treatment of a battlefield wound infection is based on broad-spectrum and high-dose antibiotics alongside surgical debridement, which are not pathogen specific, drive antibiotic resistance, can have toxic side effects, require advanced medical training, and result in high treatment costs and burden on medical professionals and patients. A dramatically better approach to managing infection of combat wounds is greatly needed.</p><p>The BioElectronics to Sense and Treat (BEST) program seeks to address this need by developing wearable, automated technologies that can predict and prevent a wound infection before it can occur, and to eliminate an infection if it has already taken hold.&nbsp;</p><p>To achieve this vision, BEST performers will develop novel bioelectronic smart bandages comprised of wound infection sensor and treatment modules. The sensors will be high-resolution and provide real-time, continual monitoring of wounds based on, for example, microbial wound community and/or host signatures. Data from these sensors will be used to predict if a wound will fail to heal due to infection, diagnose the infection, and regulate administration of targeted treatments by closedloop control to prevent a predicted infection or to resolve an existing infection so that the wound heals.&nbsp;</p><p>Given that infection initiates at the time of injury and can take hold before medivac under anti access/area denial conditions, to have the greatest impact these technologies need to be pushed forward for use on the battlefield. Even if medivac occurs immediately, without the ability to prevent infection, the downstream care required to treat the surge of wound infections resulting from a large-scale combat operation will overwhelm care capacity.</p><p>Key to success of the BEST program will be technologies that:</p><ol><li>Adapt to variations in the wound microbial community composition</li><li>Adapt to variations among individuals</li><li>Continually update the status of a wound to intervene when indicated to fail</li><li>Utilize nonantibiotic treatments to which microbes cannot develop resistance due to high rates of antibiotic resistant combat wound infections</li><li>Does not interfere with a wound that is predicted to heal on its own</li></ol><p>By the end of the program, the sensor and treatment elements will be combined into a low size, weight, and power (SWaP), closed-loop device that can provide rapid predictions and precise treatments and can be deployed at all roles of military medical care including the battlefield. Specific target metrics will be described in the forthcoming BEST Program Solicitation.</p><p>The technical objective of the BEST program is to develop technologies to TRL-5 (prototype technology produced at pilot scale that undergoes rigorous testing). In pursuing this objective, it is imperative that performer teams propose technologies that when fully developed (i.e., TRL-8, completed clinical evaluations) are reasonably expected to be mass produced at non-prohibitive costs; are reasonably expected to operate in remote and austere environments including battlefields; and are reasonably expected to be low size, weight, and power (SWaP) for use on battle fields.</p><p>In support of the BEST performer technical research efforts, DARPA and members of the Government team will make datasets available to performer teams that relate wound microbial community composition to the host immune state and the wound outcome (healed or failed to heal due to infection). In addition, DARPA will utilize Government combat wound and infection subject matter experts (SMEs) to engage with performer teams on a regular basis and assess and provide feedback on the technical aspects of the performer team efforts.</p><p>In addition to pursuing the technical objectives, BEST performers will be expected to plan for transition of their approaches and prototypes. This will include developing and executing effective strategies to prepare for regulatory, clinical, and commercialization next steps with the objective of creating opportunities for advanced development and follow-on funding from private and/or government sponsors. For the regulatory strategy, the goal is generation of a preclinical dataset in large animal models and preparation of a regulatory package such as an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) for submission to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). For the commercialization strategy, the goal is generation of a Financing and/or Investor Engagement Plan.</p><p>Beyond the battlefield, wound infections are a risk to many patients (e.g., those with diabetic foot ulcers). As such, BEST performers will be expected to address relevant military and civilian clinical and market needs in their transition strategies.</p><p>In support of BEST transition efforts, DARPA will utilize Government regulatory and commercialization SMEs to engage with performer teams on a regular basis and assess and provide feedback on the regulatory and commercialization aspects of the performer team efforts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div>

This awareness is critical to build an actionable picture of the threat environment and adhere to blue force emissions control (EMCON) procedures. To enable this awareness, ground units must have the technical capability to:</p><ol><li>Detect, separate from background noise, and characterize signals of interest, including identifying the communications protocol for signals within the RF communications band</li><li>Build a pattern of life (POL) of the RF spectrum over time</li><li>Localize and/or geolocate emitters</li></ol><p>Currently, dismounted tactical ground units are limited in their ability to accomplish all tasks in real-time. Although specialized units may be capable of doing one or more of these tasks, often characterization and identification of signals are done via reach-back organizations, and ground units won’t get feedback for hours or days later, if at all. This greatly reduces survivability and inhibits the unit’s ability to adapt to a complex, agile threat by maneuvering effectively through the RF spectrum.</p><p>Dismounted tactical ground units are equipped with man-portable software defined radios (SDRs) like the L3Harris AN/PRC-117G or AN/PRC-152A. Unfortunately, these SDRs are designed for communications and data sharing, and despite many advances in RF processing and management, they have limited ability to contribute to the technical capabilities described above. In addition to SDRs, warfighters are often equipped with Android tablets running the Android Tactical Assault Kit (ATAK) <a href="#1">[1]</a>. These Android tablets are very flexible for rapid implementation of new capabilities (e.g., incorporating AI/ML into existing plugins, new mission/domain-specific plugins). Unfortunately, the limiting factor is often the use of proprietary hardware (i.e., SDR) which prevents industry and academia from demonstrating novel technological developments that would require the manufacturer to modify/adapt their hardware.</p><p>Recently, there have been significant developments in SDR technology that facilitate rapid reconfiguration and/or adaptation for various tasks (e.g., Hedgehog SDR <a href="#2">[2]</a>). Additionally, there have been significant enhancements in handheld compute capabilities procured by the DoD. These enhancements include longer battery life; central processing unit (CPU), graphics processing unit (GPU), and neural processing unit (NPU) capacity; memory; and improved durability.</p><p>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) solicits technologies that, leveraging advancements in SDR technology, and handheld or tablet-based compute, optimize warfighter capabilities in one or more of the three technical capability areas described above.</p><p>A successful proposal should specify which of the three technical capability areas is being targeted. Proposals should include the RF bandwidth covered by the proposed solution and, if targeting the POL technical capability, the timeframe for POL required to gain specific insights. Solutions can be algorithmic, software, hardware, and/or material in nature; however, hardware/material solutions should not introduce a new physical burden on the warfighter (i.e., modifying or replacing an antenna/SDR is acceptable, but introducing an additional sensor/antenna/radio/tablet is not). Moreover, proposed solutions should not interfere with the primary function of the equipment (i.e., warfighter communication capability must not be degraded). Additionally, information should be presented in an intuitive manner that enhances situational awareness and does not impose an additional cognitive burden on the warfighter who does not have expertise in the field of RF spectrum operations.</p><p>An initial white paper describing the technical approach is required and will be evaluated. If DARPA selects a white paper for evaluation, the Government will issue an invitation to submit a full proposal. The technical white paper should include an overview of the proposed concept with details to support feasibility. The overview should address the bullets below listed in order of importance:</p><ul><li>Proposed system: Describe the proposed solution. Outline the design and operation of the main hardware and software components that are being proposed for development. Specify which parts of the solution require modification or replacement of fielded hardware.</li><li>Concept of employment: Identify how the proposed solution could be employed. Provide details about which of the three technical capability areas are being addressed, and the specific capabilities and limitations of the proposed solution. For example, a proposal targeting the POL technical capability area should specify the observation timeframe required to gain specific insights, what insights would be provided, and RF bandwidth of the proposed solution. Also identify potential new tactics, techniques, or procedures that are required for warfighters to employ the system appropriately.</li><li>Interoperability: Provide a brief analysis on how the proposed system will integrate with existing communications equipment fielded to ground tactical units. Identify potential risks that are introduced to the warfighter to include increased cognitive tasks, training requirements, potential degradation of communication, increased weight, etc.</li><li>Scalability: Provide a brief analysis of the viability of scaling the technology across both the DoD and industry. What are the non-DoD uses of the technology? Are the production costs low enough to merit widespread adoption? What are the projected maintenance and storage requirements, operational availabilities, and service lifetimes?</li></ul><h3 id="phase1">Phase I</h3><p>During Phase I, the company shall research and develop innovative solutions in one or more of the three technical capability areas described above. The company shall develop novel technology that demonstrates the technical capability to provide real-time RF situational awareness to the dismounted tactical ground user without introducing a new physical or cognitive burden to the warfighter, and without interfering with the primary function of their equipment. Proposers should recommend quarterly technical milestones that will be used to demonstrate their progress to DARPA throughout Phase I. These milestones will also be accompanied by monthly financial and technical summary reports.</p><p>At the end of Phase I, the company shall provide a formal written technical report including calculations, test data, analysis, and any relevant details from intermediate milestones. The report should also set the stage for Phase II by detailing the expected performance (i.e., RF bandwidth, timeframe for POL with expected insights, etc.) of the technology and comparing the technology to existing specialized solutions. Documentation must also include refined insights and analysis related to the previously mentioned concept of employment, interoperability, and scalability sections. A commercialization roadmap will also be required to demonstrate a high probability that continued design and development should result in a Phase II mature product.</p><h3 id="phase2">Phase II</h3><p>Produce prototype solutions that enable mission essential tasks in more complex field conditions.

## UnixWare in 2025: still actively developed and maintained

date: 2025-02-05, from: OS News

It kind of goes by under the radar, but aside from HP-UX, Solaris, and AIX, there&#8217;s another traditional classic UNIX still in active development today: UnixWare (and its sibling, OpenServer). Owned and developed by Xinuos, UnixWare and other related code and IP was acquired by them when the much-hated SCO crashed and burned about 15 years ago or so, and they&#8217;ve been maintaining it ever since. About a year ago, Xinuos released Update Pack 1 and Maintenance Pack 1 for UnixWare 7 Definitive 2018, followed by similar update packs for OpenServer 6 later in 2024. These update packs bring a bunch of bugfixes and performance improvements, as well as a slew of updated open source components, like new versions of SAMBA, sendmail, GCC and tons of other GNU components, OpenSSH and OpenSSL, and so, so much more, enabling a relatively modern and up-to-date build and porting environment. They can be installed through the patchck update utility, and while the Maintenance Pack is free for existing registered users, the Update Pack requires a separate license. UnixWare, while fully capable as a classic UNIX for workstations, isn&#8217;t really aimed at individuals or hobbyists (sadly), and instead focuses on existing enterprise deployments, where such licensing costs are par for the course. UnixWare runs on x86, and can be installed both on real hardware as well as in various virtualised environments. I contacted Xinuos a few days ago for a review license, and they supplied me with one so I can experiment with and write about UnixWare. I&#8217;ve currently got it installed in a Linux kvm, where it runs quite well, including the full X11R6 CDE desktop environment and graphical administration tools. Installing updates is a breeze thanks to patchck automating the process of finding, downloading, and installing the correct ones. I intend to ask Xinuos about an optimal configuration for running UnixWare on real hardware, too.

## MaXX Interactive Desktop 2.2.0 released

date: 2025-02-05, from: OS News

Late last year, the MaXX Interactive Desktop, the Linux (and BSD) version of the IRIX desktop, sprung back to life with a new release and a detailed roadmap. Thanks to a unique licensing agreement with SGI, MaXX&#8217; developer, Eric Masson, has been able to bring a lot of the SGI user experience over to Linux and BSD, and as promised, we have a new release: the final version of MaXX Interactive Desktop 2.2.0. It&#8217;s codenamed Octane, and anyone who knows their SGI history will chuckle at this and other codenames MaXX uses. Like last year&#8217;s alpha release, 2.2.0 brings an Exposé-like overview features, initial freedesktop.org integration, tons of performance improvements and bug fixes, desktop notifications, and much more. For the next release, 2.3.0 they&#8217;re planning a new file manager, support for .desktop files, a ton of new preference panes, a quick search feature, and a whole bunch of lower-level stuff. With how serious the renewed development effort seems, I hope that some day, the project will consider building MaXX out to a full Linux distribution, to gain more control over the experience and ensure normal users don&#8217;t have to perform a manual installation.

## Why Upstart from Ubuntu failed

date: 2025-02-04, from: OS News

Upstart was an event-based replacement for the traditional System V init (sysvinit) system on Ubuntu, introduced to bring a modern and more flexible way of handling system startup and service management. It emerged in the mid-2000s, during a period when sysvinit’s age and limitations were becoming more apparent, especially with regard to concurrency and dependency handling. Upstart was developed by Canonical, the company behind Ubuntu, with the aim of reducing boot times, improving reliability, and making the system initialization process more dynamic. Though at first it seemed likely to become a standard across many distributions, Upstart eventually lost mindshare to systemd and ceased to be Ubuntu’s default init system. ↫ André Machado I think it&#8217;s safe to say systemd won the competition to become the definitive successor to sysvinit on Linux, but Canonical&#8217;s Upstart made a valiant effort, too. However, with a troublesome license, it was doomed from the start, and it didn&#8217;t help that virtually every other major distribution eventually adopted systemd. These days, systemd is the Linux init system, and I personally quite like it (and the crowd turns violent). I find it easy to use and it&#8217;s never given me any issues, but I&#8217;m not a system administrator dealing with complex setups, so my experience with systemd is probably rather limited. It just does its thing in the background on my machines. None of this means there aren&#8217;t any other init systems still being actively developed. There&#8217;s GNU Shepard we talked about recently, runit, OpenRC, and many more. If you don&#8217;t like systemd, there&#8217;s enough alternatives out there.

## The dumb reason why flag emojis aren’t working on your site in Chrome on Windows

date: 2025-02-04, from: OS News

After doing more digging than I feel like I should have needed to, I found my answer: it appears that due to concerns about the fact that acknowledging the existence of certain countries can be perceived as a nominally political stance, Microsoft has opted to just avoid the issue altogether by not including country flag emojis in Windows’ system font. Problem solved! Can you imagine if, *gasp*, your computer could render a Taiwanese or Palestinian flag? The horror! ↫ Ryan Geyer Silicon Valley corporations are nothing if not massive cowards, and this is just another one of the many, many examples that underline this. Firefox solves this by including the flags on its own, but Google refuses to do the same with Chrome, because, you guessed it, Google is also a cowardly organisation. There are some ways around it, as the linked article details, but they&#8217;re all clumsy and cumbersome compared to Microsoft just not being a coward and including proper flag emoji, even if it offends some sensibilities in pro-China or western far-right circles. Your best bet to avoid such corporate cowardice is to switch to better operating systems, like any desktop Linux distribution. Fedora KDE includes both the Taiwanese and Palestinian flags, because the KDE project isn&#8217;t made up of cowards, and I&#8217;m sure the same applies to any GNOME distribution. If your delicate snowflake sensibilities can&#8217;t handle a Palestinian or Taiwanese flag emoji, just don&#8217;t type them. Bitter sidenote: it turns out WordPress, what OSNews uses, doesn&#8217;t like emoji, either. Adding any emoji in this story, from basic ones to the Taiwanese or Palestinian flag, makes it impossible to save or publish the story. I have no idea if this is a WordPress issue, or an issue on our end, since WordPress does mention they have emoji support.

## TuxTape: a kernel livepatching solution

date: 2025-02-04, from: OS News

Geico, an American insurance company, is building a live-patching solution for the Linux kernel, called TuxTape. TuxTape is an in-development kernel livepatching ecosystem that aims to aid in the production and distribution of kpatch patches to vendor-independent kernels. This is done by scraping the Linux CNA mailing list, prioritizing CVEs by severity, and determining applicability of the patches to the configured kernel(s). Applicability of patches is determined by profiling kernel builds to record which files are included in the build process and ignoring CVEs that do not affect files included in kernel builds deployed on the managed fleet. ↫ Presentation by Grayson Guarino and Chris Townsend It seems to me something like live-patching the Linux kernel should be a standardised framework that&#8217;s part of the Linux kernel, and not several random implementations by third parties, one of which is an insurance company. There&#8217;s a base core of functionality for live-patching in the Linux kernel since 4.0, released in 2015, but it&#8217;s extremely limited and requires most of the functionality to be implemented separately, through things like Red Hat&#8217;s kpatch and Oracle&#8217;s Ksplice. Geico is going to release TuxTape as open source, and is encouraging others to adopt and use it. There are various other solutions out there offering similar functionality, so you&#8217;re not spoiled for choice, and I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s advantages and disadvantages to each. I would still prefer if functionality like this is a standard feature of the kernel, not something tied to a specific vendor or implementation.

However, their sensitivity is fundamentally limited by quantum noise, which prevents the detection of extremely faint signals in the most precision-demanding fields.</p><p>As the world marks the 100-year anniversary of the initial development of quantum mechanics with the <a href="https://quantum2025.org/">International Year of Quantum Science and Technology</a>, DARPA’s Intensity-Squeezed Photonic Integration for Revolutionary Detectors (INSPIRED) program is working to break through the quantum noise limit. By harnessing “squeezed light,” INSPIRED seeks to develop compact, cost-effective optical detectors that can operate at unprecedented sensitivities – allowing signals previously buried in quantum noise to be clearly detected.</p><h4>The promise of squeezed light</h4><p>A fundamental concept of quantum mechanics is the Heisenberg principle, which states that due to the inherent nature of quantum systems, it is impossible to simultaneously know both the exact position and momentum of a particle with perfect accuracy – the more precisely one property is known, the greater the uncertainty in the other. With light, the principle also applies to other pairs of properties, such as the amplitude and phase of an electromagnetic wave.</p><p>Squeezed light is a unique quantum state in which the uncertainty of one of these two properties is reduced below the standard quantum noise limit, while the uncertainty in the other is increased to preserve the Heisenberg principle. This “squeezing” minimizes random noise in measurements, enabling the detection of extremely faint signals that would otherwise be imperceptible. Squeezed light systems were first applied to some of the most precise measurements ever performed to boost the sensitivity of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) – resulting in the first observation of gravitational waves and the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics. These detection systems continue to allow LIGO to capture faint signals from distant cosmic events, such as black holes and neutron star collisions.</p><p>Building on this success, INSPIRED aims to translate laboratory-based squeezed light techniques into deployable technology. The program is leveraging advancements in chip-scale photonics to develop compact, integrated squeezed-light sources 40 times quieter than the quantum noise limit. These breakthroughs will then enable the creation of highly sensitive detectors that overcome traditional noise barriers, unlocking new possibilities in fields such as sensing, communication, and quantum computing.</p><h4>INSPIRED’s roadmap</h4><p>INSPIRED is organized into two phases over three years. Phase 1 is focused on developing core squeezed-light components, with participation from eight research teams led by Hewlett Packard Enterprise, RTX BBN Technologies, Inc., Stanford University, University of Massachusetts at Amherst, University of California, Santa Barbara, University of Southern California, University of Virginia, and Yale University. To kick off the program, DARPA gathered the INSPIRED teams at the LIGO Hanford Observatory in the southeast of Washington state.</p><p>“By taking squeezed light capabilities out of the lab, we aim to drive breakthroughs across defense, scientific, and commercial applications,” said Dr. Justin Cohen, program manager in DARPA’s Microsystems Technologies Office. “Commencing the INSPIRED program at the LIGO Observatory reflects our commitment to uncovering what’s possible when we push the limits of technology through collaboration and vision.”</p><p>The anticipated culmination of INSPIRED’s efforts in Phase 2 is a complete squeezed-light detector, housed within a module the size of a deck of cards.</p><p>Visit the <a href="https://drupal.darpa.mil/research/programs/intensity-squeezed-photonic">INSPIRED program page</a> for further information.</p><p class="text-align-center">###</p><p class="text-align-center">Media with inquiries should contact DARPA Public Affairs at <a href="mailto:outreach@darpa.mil">outreach@darpa.mil</a><br>&nbsp;</p></div>

## GTK announces X11 deprecation, new Android backend, and much more

date: 2025-02-03, from: OS News

Since a number of GTK developer came together at FOSDEM, the project figured now was as good a time as any to give an update on what&#8217;s coming in GTK. First, GTK is implementing some hard cut-offs for old platforms &#8211; Windows 10 and macOS 10.15 are now the oldest supported versions, which will make development quite a bit easier and will simplify several parts of the codebase. Windows 10 was released in 2015 and macOS 10.15 in 2019, which are fair cut-off points, in my book. GTK 4.18 will also bring major accessibility improvements with the AccessKit backend, giving GTK accessibility features on Windows and macOS for the first time, which is great news. Another major new feature is the new Android backend, which, while not yet complete, will allow you to run GTK applications on Android. Do note that this is experimental, so don&#8217;t expect everything to work without any issues quite yet. Lastly, the news that everyone was freaking out about over the weekend: the X11 backend has been deprecated, and will be removed in GTK 5. This freaked a lot of people out, but note that this doesn&#8217;t mean you magically can&#8217;t use GTK 4 applications on X11 anymore &#8211; it merely means that X11 support will be removed in GTK 5, which doesn&#8217;t even exist yet, and with GTK 4 being supported until GTK 6 is released, people using legacy windowing systems like Xorg will be fine for a long time to come. As the GTK project notes on Fedi: The X11 backend being deprecated mainly means that we&#8217;re not going to spend time implementing new features, like dmabuf, graphics offloading, or Vulkan support. X11 support will still exist until GTK4 is EOL, which will happen once GTK *6* is released. We&#8217;re talking about a 20 years horizon, at this point&#8230;  Of course, somebody could show up tomorrow, and implement everything that the Wayland backend does, but for X11. We can always undeprecate things. We are not holding our breath, though… ↫ The GTK project on Fedi This is the right move, and I&#8217;m glad the GTK project is doing this, and is giving everyone ample time to prepare. A lot of people will still freak out, get mad, and scream bloody murder at certain individuals in the wider Linux community, and those people are, of course, free to start working on Xorg. Like the GTK developers, though, I&#8217;m not holding my breath, because despite years of excessive Wayland hate, not a single person has stood up to do the work required to keep Xorg going.

## Run Linux inside a PDF file via a RISC-V emulator

date: 2025-02-03, from: OS News

You might expect PDF files to only be comprised of static documents, but surprisingly, the PDF file format supports Javascript with its own separate standard library. Modern browsers (Chromium, Firefox) implement this as part of their PDF engines. However, the APIs that are available in the browser are much more limited. The full specfication for the JS in PDFs was only ever implemented by Adobe Acrobat, and it contains some ridiculous things like the ability to do 3D rendering, make HTTP requests, and detect every monitor connected to the user&#8217;s system. However, on Chromium and other browsers, only a tiny subset of this API was ever implemented, due to obvious security concerns. With this, we can do whatever computation we want, just with some very limited IO. ↫ LinuxPDF GitHub page I&#8217;m both impressed and concerned.

## The GNU Guix System

date: 2025-02-03, from: OS News

GNU Guix is a package manager for GNU/Linux systems. It is designed to give users more control over their general-purpose and specialized computing environments, and make these easier to reproduce over time and deploy to one or many devices. ↫ GNU Guix website Guix is basically GNU&#8217;s approach to a reproducible, functional package manager, very similar to Nix because, well, it&#8217;s based on Nix. GNU also has a Linux distribution built around Nix, the GNU Guix System, which is fully &#8216;libre&#8217; as all things GNU are, and also makes use of the GNU Shepard init system. Both Shepard and Guix make use of Guile. The last release of the GNU Guix System is a few years old already, but it&#8217;s a rolling release, so that&#8217;s not much of an issue. It uses the Linux kernel, but support for GNU Hurd is also being worked on, for whatever that&#8217;s worth. There&#8217;s also a third-party distribution that is built around the same projects, called rde. It focuses on being lightweight, ready for offline use, and minimal distractions. It&#8217;s probably not suitable for most normal users, but if you&#8217;re a power user and you&#8217;re looking for something a little bit different, this could be for you. While it&#8217;s in active development, it&#8217;s considered usable and stable by its creators. I haven&#8217;t tried it yet, but I&#8217;m definitely intrigued by what it has to offer. Nix sucks up a lot of the attention in this space, so it&#8217;s interesting to see some of the alternatives that aim for similar goals.
