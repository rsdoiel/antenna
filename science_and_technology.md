## Valve ends Steam’s support for Windows 7 and 8

date: 2024-11-12, from: OS News

Steam has finally stopped working on several older Windows operating systems, following a warning from Valve that it planned to drop support earlier this year. With little fanfare, Windows 7 and Windows 8 gaming on Steam is no longer possible following the most recent Steam client update on November 5. ↫ Ben Stockton at PCGamesN It&#8217;s honestly wild that Valve supported Windows 7 and 8 for this long for Steam in the first place. They&#8217;ve been out of support for a long time, and at this point in time, less than 0.3% of Steam users were using Windows 7 or 8. Investing any resources in continuing to support them would be financially irresponsible, while also aiding a tiny bit in allowing people to use such unsupported, insecure systems to this day. I&#8217;m sure at least one of you is still rocking Windows 7 or 8 as your daily driver operating system, so I&#8217;m sorry if you don&#8217;t want to hear this, but it&#8217;s really, really time to move on. Buying a Windows 10 or 11 license on eBay or whatever costs a few euros at most &#8211; if you&#8217;re not eligible for one the free upgrade programs Microsoft ran &#8211; and especially Windows 10 should run just fine on pretty much anything Windows 7 or 8 runs on. Do note that with Windows 10, though, you&#8217;ll be back in the same boat next year.
