## A brief history of Mac servers

date: 2024-12-10, from: OS News

Although there’s little evidence of them today, Apple made a long succession of Mac servers and servers for Macs from 1988 to 2014, and only discontinued support for the last release of macOS Server in April 2022. Its first entry into the market was a special version of the Macintosh II running Apple’s own port of Unix way back in 1988. ↫ Howard Oakley These days, you can nab Xserves for pretty cheap on eBay, but since Apple doesn&#8217;t properly support them anymore, they&#8217;re mostly a curiosity for people who are into retro homelab stuff and the odd Apple enthusiast who doesn&#8217;t know what to do with it. It always felt like Apple&#8217;s head was never really in the game when it came to its servers, despite the fact that both its hardware and software were quite interesting and user friendly compared to the competition. Regardless, if my wife and I ever manage to buy our own house, the basement&#8217;s definitely getting a nice homelab rack with old &#8211; mostly non-x86 Sun and HP &#8211; servers, and I think an Xserve would be a fun addition, too. Living in the Arctic means any heat they generate is useful for like 9 or so months of the year to help warm the house, and since our electricity is generated from hydropower they wouldn&#8217;t be generating a massive excess of pollution, either. I have to figure out what to do with the excess heat during the few months of the year where it&#8217;s warm outside, though.

## Meet Willow, our state-of-the-art quantum chip

date: 2024-12-10, from: OS News

Today I’m delighted to announce Willow, our latest quantum chip. Willow has state-of-the-art performance across a number of metrics, enabling two major achievements. The concensus seems to be that this is a major achievement and milestone in quantum computing, and that it&#8217;s come faster than everyone expected. This topic is obviously far more complicated than most people can handle, so we have to rely on the verdicts and opinions from independent experts to gain some sense of just how significant an announcement this really is. The paper&#8217;s published in Nature for those few of us posessing the right amount of skill and knowledge to

## The state of Falkon: KDE’s browser is much better than you know

date: 2024-12-09, from: OS News

It&#8217;s no secret that I am very worried about the future of Firefox, and the future of Firefox on Linux in particular. I&#8217;m not going to rehash these worries here, but suffice to say that with Mozilla increasingly focusing on advertising, Firefox&#8217; negligible market share, and the increasing likeliness that the Google Search deal, which accounts for 85% of Mozilla&#8217;s revenue, will come to an end, I have little faith in Firefox for Linux remaining a priority for Mozilla. On top of that, as more and more advertising nonsense, in collaboration with Facebook, makes its way into Firefox, we may soon arrive at a point where Firefox can&#8217;t be shipped by Linux distributions at all anymore, due to licensing and/or idealogical reasons. I&#8217;ve been warning the Linux community, and distributions in particular, for years now that they&#8217;re going to need an alternative default browser once the inevitable day Firefox truly shits the bed is upon us. Since I&#8217;m in the middle of removing the last few remaining bits of big tech from my life, I figured I might as well put my money where my mouth is and go on a small side quest to change my browser, too. Since I use Fedora KDE on all my machines and prefer to have as many native applications as possible, I made the switch to KDE&#8217;s own browser: Falkon. What is Falkon? Falkon started out as an independent project called QupZilla, but in 2017 it joined the KDE project and was renamed to Falkon. It uses QtWebEngine as its engine, which is Qt&#8217;s version of the Chromium engine, but without all the services that talk to Google, which are stripped out. This effectively makes it similar to using de-Googled Chromium. The downside is that QtWebEngine does lag behind the current Chromium version; QtWebEngine 6.8.0, the current version, is Chromium 122, while Chromium 133 is current at the time of writing. The fact that Falkon uses a variant of the Chromium engine means websites just work, and there&#8217;s really nothing to worry about when it comes to compatibility. Another advantage of using QtWebEngine is that the engine is updated independently from the browser, so even if it seems Falkon isn&#8217;t getting much development, the engine it uses is updated regularly as part of your distribution&#8217;s and KDE&#8217;s Qt upgrades. The downside, of course, is that you&#8217;re using a variant of Chromium, but at least it&#8217;s de-Googled and entirely invisible to the user. It&#8217;s definitely not great, and it contributes to the Chromium monoculture, but I can also understand that a project like Qt isn&#8217;t going to develop its own browser engine, and in turn, it makes perfect sense for KDE, as a flagship Qt product, to use it as well. It&#8217;s the practical choice, and I don&#8217;t blame either of them for opting for what works, and what works now &#8211; the reality is that no matter what browser you&#8217;re choose, you&#8217;re either using a browser made by Google, or one kept afloat by Google. Pick your poison. It&#8217;s not realistic for Qt or KDE to develop their own browser engine from scratch, so opting for the most popular and very well funded browser engine and strip out all of its nasty Google bits makes the most sense. Yes, we&#8217;d all like to have more capable browser engines and thus more competition, but we have to be realistic and understand that&#8217;s not going to happen while developing a browser engine is as complex as developing an entire operating system. Falkon&#8217;s issues and strengths While rendering websites, compatibility, and even performance is excellent &#8211; as a normal user I don&#8217;t notice any difference between running Chrome, Firefox, or Falkon on my machines &#8211; the user interface and feature set is where Falkon stumbles a bit. There&#8217;s a few things users have come to expect from their browser that Falkon simply doesn&#8217;t offer yet, and those things needs to be addressed if the KDE project wants Falkon to be a viable alternative to Firefox and Chrome, instead of just a languishing side project nobody uses. The biggest thing you&#8217;ll miss is without a doubt support for modern extensions. Falkon does have support for the deprecated PPAPI plugin interface and its own extensions system, but there&#8217;s no support for the modern extensions API Firefox, Chrome, and other browsers use. What this means for you as a user is that there are effectively no extensions available for Falkon, and that&#8217;s a huge thing to suddenly have to do without. Luckily, Falkon does have adblock built-in, including support for custom block lists, so the most important extension is there, but that&#8217;s it. There&#8217;s a very old bug report/feature request about adding support for Firefox/Chrome extensions, which in turn points to a similar feature request for QtWebEngine to adopt support for such extensions. The gist is that for Falkon to get support for modern Firefox and Chrome extensions, it will have to go through QtWebEngine and thus the Qt project. While I personally can just about get by with using the BitWarden application (instead of the extension) and the built-in adblock, I think this is an absolute most for most people to adopt Falkon in any serious numbers. Most people who would consider switching to a different browser than Chrome or Firefox are going to need extensions support. The second major thing you&#8217;ll miss is any lack of synchronisation support. You won&#8217;t be synchronising your bookmarks across different machines, let alone open tabs. Of course, this extends to mobile, where Falkon has no presence, so don&#8217;t expect to send your open tabs from your phone to your desktop as you get home. While I don&#8217;t think this is as big of an issue as the lack of modern extensions, it&#8217;s something I use a lot when working on OSNews &#8211; I find stories to link to while browsing on my phone, and then open them on my desktop to post them through the tab sharing feature of Firefox, and

## Unofficial Windows 11 mobile is possible even on select budget phones with a free utility

date: 2024-12-09, from: OS News

Back in December 2019, Microsoft&#160;finally killed off Windows 10 Phone&#160;as it announced the end of support. The company&#8217;s grand plans with Lumia and Windows Phones sadly never became the success it needed to be in order to be able to compete with the likes of Android or iOS. Thus Windows 11 Phone never became a real official thing&#160;outside of concepts. However, there is a free unofficial way that makes it possible, albeit the experience may not totally be free from flaws. Dubbed Project Renegade, the mod enables users to try Windows 11 on Qualcomm Snapdragon phones, among other devices. ↫ Sayan Sen at Neowin Windows Phone 7 and 8 were amazing, and probably my favourite mobile platform of all time. I&#8217;m still sad that the duopoly made it impssible even for Microsoft to gain a foothold, because their efforts definitely deserved it. They didn&#8217;t just blindly copy Android or iOS, but came up with a truly original, unique, and in my view, superior mobile operating system, and in a fair market, they would&#8217;ve been rewarded for it, and Windows Phone would have a perhaps small, but profitable segment of the market. In the vein of Bernie can still win, I still have this faint belief that Microsoft hasn&#8217;t completely given up on the smartphone market. Now that they&#8217;re serious about Windows on ARM, they might use it as sneaky way to get application developers on board, so that their applications are ready for the big Surface Phone a few years from now, complete with Windows Phone-inspired features and UI. I know this won&#8217;t happen, but let me enjoy my non-existent future, please. I don&#8217;t want to rely on big tech anymore, but I might make an exception for an up-to-date Windows Phone. I&#8217;m only human.
