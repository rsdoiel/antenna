## Microsoft changes pre-production driver signing, ends the device metadata service

date: 2025-05-07, from: OS News

As the headline suggests, we&#8217;re going to be talking about some very dry Windows stuff that only affects a relatively small number of people, but for those people this is a big deal they need to address. If you&#8217;re working on pre-production drivers that need to be signed, this is important to you. The Windows Hardware Program supports partners signing drivers for use in pre-production environments. The CA that is used to sign the binaries for use in pre-production environments on the Windows Hardware Program is set to expire in July 2025, following which a new CA will be used to sign the preproduction content starting June 9, 2025. ↫ Hardware Dev Center Alongside the new CA come a bunch of changes to the rules. First and foremost, expiry of signed drivers will no longer be tied to the expiry of the underlying CA, so any driver signed with the new CA will not expire, regardless of what happens to the CA. In addition, on April 22, May 13, and June 10, 2025, Windows servicing releases (4D/5B/6B) will be shipped to Windows versions (down to Windows Server 2008) to replace the old CAs with the new ones. As such, if you&#8217;re working on pre-production drivers, you need to install those Latest Cumulative updates. On a very much related note, Microsoft has announced it&#8217;s retiring device metadata and the Windows Metadata and Internet Services (WMIS). This is what allowed OEMs and device makers to include things like device names, custom device icons, and other information in the form of an XML file. While OEMs can no longer create new device metadata this way, existing metadata already installed on Windows clients will remain functional. As a replacement for this functionality, Microsoft points to the driver&#8217;s INF files, where such information and icons can also be included. Riveting stuff.

## openSUSE removes Deepin from its repositories after long string of security issues and unauthorised security bypass

date: 2025-05-07, from: OS News

The openSUSE team has decided to remove the Deepin Desktop Environment from openSUSE, after the project&#8217;s packager for openSUSE was found to have added workaround specifically to bypass various security requirements openSUSE has in place for RPM packages. Recently we noticed a policy violation in the packaging of the Deepin desktop environment in openSUSE. To get around security review requirements, our Deepin community packager implemented a workaround which bypasses the regular RPM packaging mechanisms to install restricted assets. As a result of this violation, and in the light of the difficult history we have with Deepin code reviews, we will be removing the Deepin Desktop packages from openSUSE distributions for the time being. ↫ Matthias Gerstner Matthias Gerstner goes into great detail to lay out every single time the openSUSE team found massive, glaring security issues in Deepin, and the complete lack of adequate responses from the Deepin upstream team over the past 8 or so years. It&#8217;s absolutely shocking to see how utterly lax the Deepin developers have been regarding the security of their desktop environment and its dependencies, and the openSUSE team could really only come to one harsh conclusion: Deepin has no security culture whatsoever, and it&#8217;s extremely likely that every corner of the Deepin code is riddled with very serious security issues. As such, despite the relatively large number of Deepin users on openSUSE, the team has decided to remove Deepin from openSUSE entirely, instead pointing users to a third-party repository if they desire to keep using Deepin. I think this is the best possible option in this situation, but it&#8217;s not exactly ideal. After reading this entire saga, however, I don&#8217;t think anyone who cares about security should be using Deepin. Of course, I doubt this will be the end of the story. What about all the other Linux distributions out there? The security issues in Deepin itself are most likely also present in Debian, Fedora, and other distributions who have the Deepin Desktop Environment in their repositories, but what about the workaround to bypass packaging security practices? Does that exist elsewhere as well? I think we&#8217;re about to find out.

## curl bans “AI” security reports as Zuckerberg claims we’ll all have more “AI” friends than real ones

date: 2025-05-07, from: OS News

Daniel Stenberg, creator and maintainer of curl, has had enough of the neverending torrent of &#8220;AI&#8221;-generated security reports the curl project has to deal with. That&#8217;s it. I&#8217;ve had it. I&#8217;m putting my foot down on this craziness. 1. Every reporter submitting security reports on Hackerone for curl now needs to answer this question: &#8220;Did you use an AI to find the problem or generate this submission?&#8221; (and if they do select it, they can expect a stream of proof of actual intelligence follow-up questions) 2. We now ban every reporter INSTANTLY who submits reports we deem AI slop. A threshold has been reached. We are effectively being DDoSed. If we could, we would charge them for this waste of our time. We still have not seen a single valid security report done with AI help. ↫ Daniel Stenberg This is the real impact of &#8220;AI&#8221;: streams of digital trash real humans have to clean up. While proponents of &#8220;AI&#8221; keep claiming it will increase productivity, actual studies show this not to be the case. Instead, what &#8220;AI&#8221; is really doing is create more work for others to deal with by barfing useless garbage into other people&#8217;s backyards. It&#8217;s like the digital version of the western world sending its trash to third-world countries to deal with. The best possible sign that &#8220;AI&#8221; is a toxic trash heap you wouldn&#8217;t want to have anything to do with are the people fighting for team &#8220;AI&#8221;. In Zuckerberg’s vision for a new digital future, artificial-intelligence friends outnumber human companions and chatbot experiences supplant therapists, ad agencies and coders. AI will play a central role in the human experience, the Facebook co-founder and CEO of Meta Platforms has said in a series of recent podcasts, interviews and public appearances. ↫ Meghan Bobrowsky at the WSJ Mark Zuckerberg, who built his empire by using people&#8217;s photos without permission so he could rank who was hotter, who used Facebook logins to break into journalists&#8217; email accounts because they were about to publish a negative story about him, who called Facebook users &#8220;dumb fucks&#8221; for entrusting their personal information to him, is on the forefront fighting for &#8220;AI&#8221;. If that isn&#8217;t the ultimate proof there&#8217;s something deeply wrong and ethically unsound about &#8220;AI&#8221;, I don&#8217;t know what is.

## TDE’s Qt 3 fork drops the 3

date: 2025-05-07, from: OS News

The Trinity Desktop Environment, the continuation of the final KDE 3.x release updated and maintained for modern times, consists of more than just the KDE bits you may think of. The project also maintains a fork of Qt 3 called TQt3, which it obviously needs to be able to work on and improve TDE itself, which is based on it. In the beginning, this fork consisted mainly of renaming things, but in recent years, more substantial changes meant that the code diverged considerably from the original Qt 3. As such, a small name change is in order. TQt3 was born as a fork of Qt3 and for many years it was little more than a mere renaming effort. Over the past few years, many changes were made and the code has significantly diverged from the original Qt3, although still sharing the same roots. With more changes planned ahead and with the intention of better highlighting such difference, the TDE team has decided to drop the &#8216;3&#8217; from the repository name, which is now simply called &#8216;TQt&#8216;. ↫ TDE on Mastodon The effect this has on users is rather minimal &#8211; users of the current 14.1.x release branch will still see 3s around in file paths and package names, but in future 14.2.x releases, all of these will have been removed, completing the transition. This seems like a small change, and that&#8217;s because it is, but it&#8217;s interesting simply because it highlights that a project that seems relatively straightforward on the outside &#8211; maintain and carefully modernise the final KDE 3.x release &#8211; encompasses a lot more than that. Maintaining an entire Qt 3 fork certainly isn&#8217;t a small feat, but it&#8217;s kind of required to keep a project like TDE going.

## VectorVFS: your filesystem as a vector database

date: 2025-05-06, from: OS News

VectorVFS is a lightweight Python package that transforms your Linux filesystem into a vector database by leveraging the native VFS (Virtual File System) extended attributes. Rather than maintaining a separate index or external database, VectorVFS stores vector embeddings directly alongside each file—turning your existing directory structure into an efficient and semantically searchable embedding store. VectorVFS supports Meta’s Perception Encoders (PE)  which includes image/video encoders for vision language understanding, it outperforms InternVL3, Qwen2.5VL and SigLIP2 for zero-shot image tasks. We support both CPU and GPU but if you have a large collection of images it might take a while in the first time to embed all items if you are not using a GPU. ↫ Christian S. Perone It won&#8217;t surprise many of you that this goes a bit above my paygrade, but according to my limited understanding, VectorVFS stores information about files inside the xattr part of inodes. The information being stored is converted into vectors first, and this is the part that breaks my brain a bit, because vectors in this context are far too complex for me to understand. I vaguely understand the end result here &#8211; making files searchable using vector magic without using a dedicated database or separate files by using extended attributes in inodes &#8211; but the process is far more complicated to understand. It still seems like a very interesting approach, though, and I&#8217;d love for people smarter than me to take VectorVFS apart and explain it in easier terms for those of us who don&#8217;t fully grasp it.

## Redox gets services management, completes userspace process manager

date: 2025-05-06, from: OS News

Can someone please stop these months from coming and going, because I&#8217;m getting dizzy with yet another monthly report of all the progress made by Redox. Aside from the usual swath of improvements to the kernel, relibc, drivers, and so on, this month saw the completion of the userspace process manager. In monolithic kernels this management is done in the kernel, resulting in necessary ambient authority, and possibly constrained interfaces if a stable ABI is to be guaranteed. With this userspace implementation, it will be easier to manage access rights using capabilities, reduce kernel bugs by keeping it simpler, and make changes where both sides of the interface can be updated simultaneously. ↫ Ribbon and Ron Williams Students at Georgia Tech have been hard at work this winter on Redox as well, building a system health monitoring and recovery daemon and user interface. The Redox team has also done a lot of work to improve the build infrastructure, fixing a number of related issues along the way. The sudo daemon has now replaced the setuid bit for improved user authentication security, and a ton of existing ports have been fixed and updated where needed. Redox&#8217; monthly progress is kind of stunning, and it&#8217;s clear there&#8217;s a lot of interesting in the Rust-based operating system from outside the project itself as well. I wonder at what point Redox becomes usable for at least some daily, end-user tasks. I think it&#8217;s not quite there yet, especially when it comes to hardware support, but I feel like it&#8217;s getting there faster than anyone anticipated.

## Google accidentally reveals Android’s Material 3 Expressive interface ahead of I/O

date: 2025-05-06, from: OS News

Google&#8217;s accelerated Android release cycle will soon deliver a new version of the software, and it might look quite different from what you&#8217;d expect. Amid rumors of a major UI overhaul, Google seems to have accidentally published a blog post detailing &#8220;Material 3 Expressive,&#8221; which we expect to see revealed at I/O later this month. Google quickly removed the post from its design site, but not before the Internet Archive saved it. ↫ Ryan Whitwam at Ars Technica Google seems to be very keen on letting us know this new redesign is based on a lot of user research and metrics, which always sets off alarm bells in my mind when it comes to user interfaces. Every single person uses their smartphone and its applications a little differently, and using tons of metrics and data to average all of this out can make it so that anyone who strays to far from that average is going to have a bad time. This is compounded by the fact that each and every one of us is going to stray form the average in at least a few places. Google also seems to be throwing consistency entirely out of the window with this redesign, which chills me to the bone. One of the reasons I like the current iteration of Material Design so much is that it does a great job of visually (and to a less extent, behaviourally) unifying the operating system and the applications you use, which I personally find incredibly valuable. I very much prefer consistency over disparate branding, and the screenshots and wording I&#8217;m seeing here seem to indicate Google considers that a problem that needs fixing. As with everything UI, screenshots don&#8217;t tell the whole story, so maybe it won&#8217;t be so bad. I mean, it&#8217;s not like I&#8217;ve got anywhere else to go in case Google messes this up. Monopolies (or duopolies) are fun.

## IBM unveils the LinuxONE Emperor 5

date: 2025-05-06, from: OS News

Following the recent release of the IBM z17 mainframe, IBM today unveiled the LinuxONE Emperor 5, which packs much of the same hardware as the z17, but focused on Linux use. Today we&#8217;re announcing IBM LinuxONE 5, performant Linux computing platform for data, applications and your trusted AI, powered by the IBM Telum II processor with built-in AI acceleration. This launch comes at a pivotal time, as technology leaders focus on three critical imperatives: enabling security, improving cost-efficiency, and integrating AI into enterprise systems. ↫ Marcel Mitran and Tina Tarquinio Yes, much like the z17, the LinuxONE 5 is a huge &#8220;AI&#8221; buzzword bonanza, but that&#8217;s to be expected in this day and age. The LinuxONE 5, which, again, few of us will ever get to work with, officially supports Red Hat, OpenSUSE, and Ubuntu, but a variety of other Linux distributions offers support for IBM&#8217;s Z hardware, as well.

## Building your own Atomic (bootc) Desktop

date: 2025-05-05, from: OS News

Bootc and associated tools provide the basis for building a personalised desktop. This article will describe the process to build your own custom installation. ↫ Daniel Mendizabal at Fedora Magazine The fact that atomic distributions make it relatively easy to create custom &#8220;distributions&#8221; is s really interesting bonus quality of these types of Linux distributions. The developers behind Blue95, which we talked about a few weeks ago, based their entire distribution on this bootc personalised desktop approach using Fedora, and they argue that the term &#8220;distribution&#8221; probably isn&#8217;t the correct term here: Blue95 is a collection of scripts and YAML files cobbled together to produce a Containerfile, which is built via GitHub Actions and published to the GitHub Container Registry. Which part of this process elevates the project to the status of a Linux distribution? What set of RUN commands in the Containerfile take the project from being merely a Fedora-based OCI image to a full-blown Linux distribution? ↫ Adam Fidel While this discussion is mostly academic, I still find it interesting how with the march of technology, and with the aid of new ideas, it&#8217;s becoming easier and easier to spin up a customised version of you favourite Linux distribution, making it incredibly easy to have your own personal ISO, with all your settings, themes, and customisations applied. This has always been possible, but it seems to be getting easier. Atomic, immutable distributions are not for me, personally, but I firmly believe most distributions focusing on average, normal users &#8211; Ubuntu, Fedora, SUSE &#8211; will eventually move their immutable variants to the prime spot on their web sites. This will make a whole lot of people big mad, but I think it&#8217;s inevitable. Of course, traditional Linux distributions won&#8217;t be going away, but much like how people keep complaining about systemd despite the tons alternatives, I&#8217;m guessing the same will happen with immutable distributions.

## GTK markup language Blueprint becomes part of GNOME

date: 2025-05-05, from: OS News

This week&#8217;s This Week in GNOME mentions that Blueprint will become part of GNOME. Blueprint is now part of the GNOME Nightly SDK and is expected to be part of the GNOME 49 SDK. This means, apps relying on Blueprint won’t have to install it manually anymore. Blueprint is an alternative to defining GTK/Libadwaita user interface via .ui XML-files (GTK Builder files). The goal of blueprint is to provide UI definitions that require less boilerplate than XML and are easier to learn. Blueprint also provides a language server for IDE integration. ↫ Sophie Herold Quite a few applications already make use of Blueprint, and even some Core GNOME applications use it, so it seems logical to make it part of the default GNOME installation.

## NASA Data Helps Map Tiny Plankton That Feed Giant Right Whales

In the waters off New England, one of Earth’s rarest mammals swims slowly, mouth agape.

Only about 370 of these massive creatures remain. For […]
