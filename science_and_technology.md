## KDE Plasma 6.4 released

date: 2025-06-17, from: OS News

A new version of Plasma is here, and it feels even more like /home, as it becomes smoother, friendlier and more helpful. Plasma 6.4 improves on nearly every front, with progress being made in accessibility, color rendering, tablet support, window management, and more. ↫ KDE Plasma 6.4 release announcement KDE Plasma 6.4 comes with a big improvement in window and virtual desktop management, allowing you to create entirely custom tiled configurations per virtual desktop. Accessibility was another focus of this release, as we talked about a few weeks ago, bringing number pad mouse pointer navigation, improved desktop zoom, screen readers improvements, better contrast i the dark theme, tons of little legibility improvements across the desktop environment and its applications, and more. Furthermore, there&#8217;s now finally a dedicated page in Settings for animations, so you no longer have to dig your way through the oddly placed and obtuse Desktop Effects page. Notifications have been improved as well, with new additions like a speed graph in file transfer notifications or Plasma notifying you when you&#8217;re trying to use a muted microphone input. KRunner can now visualise colours when searching for a hex code, Spectacle has received some love, various widgets have been touched up, and much more. There&#8217;s a brand new HDR wizard, support for Extended Dynamic Range, and the addition of the P010 video color format. System Monitor will now show usage information for Intel and AMD GPUs, and Info Center will show raw sensor data from the sensors in your device. There&#8217;s a ton more, as this is a fairly major release. You can download and compile KDE Plasma 6.4 now, or just wait a few days until it lands in your distribution&#8217;s repository.

## Haiku’s development activity seems to be shifting from the operating system to its applications

date: 2025-06-17, from: OS News

I hate how these months keep going down like vodka-martinis on an Italian beach, but at least we get another progress report for Haiku every time. Aside from the usual small changes and bug fixes, the most important of which is probably allowing the EXT4 driver to read and write again, there&#8217;s this little paragraph at the end which definitely stands out. This month was a bit lighter than usual, it seems most of the developers (myself included) were busy with other things… However, HaikuPorts remained quite active: most months, at this point, there are more commits to HaikuPorts than Haiku, and sometimes by a significant margin, too (for May, it was 52 in Haiku vs. 258 in HaikuPorts!). I think overall this is a sign of Haiku’s growing maturity: the system seems stable enough that the porters can do their work without uncovering too many bugs in Haiku that interrupt or halt their progress. ↫ Haiku activity report for May I definitely hope that this positive read is correct, as it would be a shame for the project to run into declining activity and contributions just as it seems to be serving as a solid base for quite a wide variety of applications. I&#8217;ve definitely been seeing more and more people giving Haiku a try lately and coming away impressed, but of course, that&#8217;s just anecdotal and I have no idea if that means Haiku has reached a certain point of maturity. One thing that definitely does indicate Haiku is a lot more stable and generally usable than most people think is the massive amount solid ports the platform can handle, from Firefox to LibreOffice, and everything in between. I think a lot of people would be surprised by just how far they can get with their day-to-day computing needs with Haiku, assuming their hardware can boot Haiku and is properly supported, of course. My opinion on Haiku has not changed, but I&#8217;m a random idiot you shouldn&#8217;t be listening to. The cold and harsh truth is that old people like me who want their BeOS boomerware but in 2025, are a small minority who are impossible to please. The Haiku team&#8217;s focus on getting modern software ported to Haiku, instead or trying to convince people to code brand new native Haiku applications, is objectively the correct choice to ensure the viability of the platform going forward. If Haiku wishes to fully outgrow its hobby status, looking towards the future is a far better approach than clinging to the past, and unsurprisingly, Haiku&#8217;s developers are more than smart enough to realise that.

## Twin: a text-mode window environment

date: 2025-06-16, from: OS News

Wayland this, Liquid Glass that &#8211; but what if you just want a nice, comforting text-based environment? Sure, you can just boot straight into a terminal, or perhaps get fancy about it with Screen or whatever, but what if you want a text-based environment, but don&#8217;t want to give up windows, menus, your mouse? How about a graphical user interface made up entirely of text? It looks exactly like what you&#8217;d think this would look like, and I find it absolutely fascinating. I&#8217;m not entirely sure how usable it is or who or what use case it&#8217;s optimised for, but I adore the dedication to the cause. It works on both Linux and FreeBSD, and most likely other systems as well.

## Making GNOME’s GdkPixbuf image loading safer

date: 2025-06-16, from: OS News

A new image loading machinery, called glycin, has been in the works for a while. It is already used by GNOME’s default Image Viewer (Loupe), as well as by a bunch of other apps. Glycin provides many security benefits over existing solutions due to the use of the Rust programming language and sandboxing. Distributions will now be able to use the security benefits and broader format support of glycin for other GNOME apps, thumbnailers, and GNOME Shell, whithout changing any existing software. This is made possible by a new option for GNOME’s legacy image-loading library, GdkPixbuf, to use glycin internally. ↫ Sophie Herold Clearly, this is an improvement over the previous image loading library, but there&#8217;s a bit of a catch that is in line with GNOME&#8217;s increased reliance on systemd features: glycin only works on Linux due to its sandbox mechanisms and how it communicates with its loaders. However, there&#8217;s no need to fret this time, and that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m posting this item &#8211; you just know this tiny little tidbit will find their way into internet discussion forums and social media as another example of GNOME not caring about non-Linux users. While some of the sandboxing and communication features in glycin can be made to work on the BSDs and perhaps macOS, it won&#8217;t be perfect. As such, great care has been taken to ensure non-Linux platforms can continue to use GdkPixbuf just fine, since support for other platforms is part of the goals of this change before traditional loaders are removed. As a general solution for other platforms, I am planning a mechanism to compile the loaders into the library. This will not provide sandboxing and format extendability without recompilation. But since most loaders are written in Rust, this is still a huge step-up security wise. Contributions for support on other platforms are welcome. For GdkPixbuf users, this will not pose an immediate issue since traditional gdk-pixbuf loaders are not going away until all platforms it supported, are supported by glycin. ↫ Sophie Herold There are a few other issues, as any change like this tends to cause, like the list of supported images formats. Glycin supports AVIF, BMP, DDS, Farbfeld, QOI, GIF, HEIC, ICO, JPEG, JPEG XL, OpenEXR, PNG, PNM, SVG, TGA, TIFF, and WEBP out of the box, but some of the subformats within each of these might potentially not work entirely correctly due to incorrect implementations by, say, camera manufacturers. A special case here is the TIFF format, which apparently still has a number of issues and might end up relying on a fallback. Glycin brings a ton of benefits, such as improved colour support for things like HDR and wider colour gamut displays, better metadata support, basic image editing functions out of the box, increased performance, as well as the benefits inherent in using a memory-safe language like Rust.

## Reddit user surprised when 1960s computer panel emerged from collapsed family garage

date: 2025-06-16, from: OS News

Recently, a Reddit user discovered a rare RCA Spectra 70/35 computer control panel from 1966 in their family&#8217;s old collapsed garage, posting photos of the pre-moon landing mainframe component to the &#8220;retrobattlestations&#8221; subreddit that celebrates vintage computers. After cleaning the panel and fixing most keyswitches, the original poster noted that actually running it would require &#8220;1,500lbs of mainframe&#8221;—the rest of the computer system that&#8217;s missing. ↫ Benj Edwards at Ars Technica Apparently, no photos of this panel existed online, and it may be one of the few &#8211; if only &#8211; &#8216;surviving&#8217; example of such a panel. Of course, it&#8217;s effectively useless without all of the other chunks that make up the entire Spectra mainframe, but it&#8217;s still an interesting find. The person who found it intends to turn it into what is essentially a piece of home decor, but maybe we&#8217;ll get lucky and someone else out there who has been collecting parts and pieces to assemble a working RCA Spectra 70/35 can do something more productive with it.

## LibreOffice 25.8 removes support for Windows 7, 8, and 8.1

Are you still using Windows 7, 8, 8.1, or a 32 bit version of Windows, relying on LibreOffice for your sexy office tasks of writing TPS reports and calculating and tabulating juicy, plump numbers? Bad news: the next version of LibreOffice will remove support for these platforms. Buried deep in the release notes of the second beta for LibreOffice 25.8, it reads: Support for Windows 7 and 8/8.1 was removed. Support for x86 (32-bit) Windows builds is deprecated. ↫ LibreOffice 25.8 beta 2 release notes I honestly doubt many people actually still rely on LibreOffice on these platforms, and even if for some unfathomable reason you do, you are probably also okay with sticking with an older version of LibreOffice to keep your weird setup going a few years longer.

## An excuse to mention Void Linux: XBPS 0.60 released

date: 2025-06-15, from: OS News

Since Void Linux uses a rolling release model, there&#8217;s not much to report on in the form of new releases and major new features, so I&#8217;m taking the release of version 0.60 of XBPS, Void Linux&#8217; package manager, to cheat my way into talking about this excellent Linux distribution. I always think of Void as the &#8220;BSD of Linux distributions&#8221;, which should give you some vague hint as to what it&#8217;s going for. XBPS 0.60 doesn&#8217;t come packed with major new features either, and mostly fixes a ton of bugs, addresses few memory leaks, and changes the way held dependencies and directory removal/creation works when reinstalling a packages, just to name a few. There&#8217;s also some performance improvements, as there were apparently some problems in that department due to the increasing number of virtual packages in the Void repository. If you&#8217;re looking for a more traditional, hands-on Linux distribution, Void is an excellent choice. It&#8217;s my back-up for if (let&#8217;s face it: when) Fedora messes something up.
