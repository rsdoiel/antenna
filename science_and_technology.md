<h4>A virtual environment makes a great de-hype advisor</h4> <p><strong>Opinion</strong>  In human imagination, AIs have been good for two things: trying to take over, and loving a good game. The earliest post-war AI thinkers took it almost for granted that once computers could beat humans at chess, true artificial intelligence would have arrived. Such thinking was disproved 50 years on when IBM&#39;s Deep Blue beat Kasparov in 1997.

## WinUAE 6.0.0 released

date: 2025-07-07, from: OS News

WinUAE has released version 6.0.0 of the Windows version of the UAE Amiga emulator, packing a truly terrifying number of changes, improvements, and fixes. Major update to custom chipset emulation. Internally almost everything in main chipset emulation has been rewritten. Fastest possible/JIT mode chipset timing/sync had major changes which can cause side-effects. Bugs are very possible, especially in very rarely used features. ↫ WinUAE website Going through the changelog is dizzying, ranging from an almost complete rewrite of the main chipset emulation for internal cycle accuracy, to running the emulation of the Denise/Lisa chips in a separate thread for better performance, to a ton of fixes and smaller updates.

## MacOS’ icons keep getting worse every time Apple touches them

date: 2025-07-06, from: OS News

With macOS 26, Apple has announced a dramatically new look to their UI: Liquid Glass. Solid material icon elements give way to softer, shinier, glassier icons. The rounded rectangle became slightly more rounded, and Apple eliminated the ability for icon elements to extend beyond the icon rectangle (as seen in the current icons for GarageBand, Photo Booth, Dictionary, etc.). With this release being one of the most dramatic visual overhauls of macOS&#8217;s design, I wanted to begin a collection chronicling the evolution of the system icons over the years. I&#8217;ve been rolling these out on social media over the past week and will continue to add to and update this collection slowly over the summer. Enjoy! ↫ BasicAppleGuy Every single one of these icons is getting progressively worse with almost every design change. They go from beautifully crafted, easily readable and supremely distinguishable icons to generic, repetitive blobs of colour, void of any personality, artistry, or usability considerations. Also, Apple&#8217;s new icon design language makes the icons look fuzzy, like they&#8217;re not being rendered properly. It&#8217;s very unnerving. The one exception is probably the generic folder icon, which looks fine in all of its incarnations. Then there&#8217;s the classic Platinum, pixelated version from Mac OS 9 and earlier, which, together with icons from Windows and BeOS from the same time period, are a whole different style that I don&#8217;t think most people would accept anymore these days, but that I absolutely adore. Mostly I&#8217;m just sad that the craft of making exquisite icons for operating systems is dying, replaced by what almost look like &#8220;AI&#8221; generated blobs of indeterminate meaning, that rely more on preexisting knowledge of the operating system and its applications in question than on being recognisable and decipherable by anyone. I truly hope Windows and the various open source desktops don&#8217;t follow in Apple&#8217;s footsteps here.

## Tone-deaf Xbox executive urges laid off employees to talk to Copilot for emotional support

date: 2025-07-06, from: OS News

A couple of days ago, Microsoft announced 9,000 layoffs across its global workforce, impacting its engineering, Xbox, sales, and management teams. This move also affected various initiatives, resulting in the cancellation of at least three Xbox games, job cuts across various studios, and even the shuttering of one game studio, The Initiative. In the wake of this dark day in the the tech industry, a tone-deaf Microsoft executive urged laid off workers to turn to AI tools for emotional support. ↫ Usama Jawad at Neowin These corporations are raking in massive amounts of profit, they&#8217;re doing better than ever, the cup of money runneth over, and yet, they keep laying off thousands and thousands of people almost every few months. The incentives in modern-day capitalism clearly aren&#8217;t working out for the vast majority of people, and then to give that final kick when you&#8217;re already down, some asshat manager tells you to &#8220;talk to&#8221; sparkly autocomplete for emotional support. Fuck this guy.
