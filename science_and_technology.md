<h4>Never mind the chatbot&#39;s recent erratic behavior</h4> <p>Microsoft has added xAI&#39;s Grok 3 family to its Azure AI Foundry platform, seemingly unfazed by the firm&#39;s rivalry with Microsoft investee OpenAI or the chatbot&#39;s recent descent into conspiracy territory.…</p>

## Microsoft releases WSL as open source, announces CLI text editor to replace the MS-DOS Editor

date: 2025-05-19, from: OS News

Today we’re very excited to announce the open-source release of the Windows Subsystem for Linux. This is the result of a multiyear effort to prepare for this, and a great closure to the first ever issue raised on the Microsoft/WSL repo: Will this be Open Source? · Issue #1 · microsoft/WSL. That means that the code that powers WSL is now available on GitHub at Microsoft/WSL and open sourced to the community! You can download WSL and build it from source, add new fixes and features and participate in WSL’s active development. ↫ Pierre Boulay at the Windows Blogs Windows Subsystem for Linux seems like a relatively popular choice for people who want a modern, Linux-based development environment but are stuck using Windows. I&#8217;m happy to see Microsoft releasing it as open source, which is no longer something to be surprised by at this point in time. It leaves one to wonder how long it&#8217;s going to be before more parts of Windows will be released as open source, since it could allow Microsoft&#8217;s leadership to justify some serious job cuts. I honestly have no idea how close to the real thing Windows Subsystem for Linux is, and if it can actually fully replace a proper Linux installation, with all the functionality and performance that entails. I&#8217;m no developer, have no interest in Windows, so I&#8217;ve never actually tried it. I&#8217;d love to hear some experiences from all of you. Aside from releasing WSL as open source, Microsoft also released a new command-line text editor &#8211; simply called Edit. It&#8217;s also open source, in its early stages, and is basically the equivalent of Nano. It turns out 32bit versions of Windows up until Windows 10 still shipped with the MS-DOS Editor, but obviously that one needed a replacement. It already has support for multiple documents, mouse support, and a few more basic features.

## With how user-hostile Windows and macOS are, is it any wonder people long for computers from the ’80s and ’90s?

date: 2025-05-19, from: OS News

Every so often people yearn for a lost (1980s or so) era of &#8216;single user computers&#8217;, whether these are simple personal computers or high end things like Lisp machines and Smalltalk workstations. It&#8217;s my view that the whole idea of a 1980s style &#8220;single user computer&#8221; is not what we actually want and has some significant flaws in practice. ↫ Chris Siebenmann I think the premise of this entire article is flawed, and borders on being a strawman argument. I honestly don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s many people out there who genuinely and seriously want to use an &#8217;80s home computer for all their computing tasks, but this article seems to think that there are. Virtually every single person expressing interest in and a desire for classic computers does so from a point of nostalgia, as a learning experience, or as a hobby. They&#8217;re definitely not interested in using any of those &#8217;80s machine to do their banking or to collaborate with their colleagues. Additionally, the problems and issues people have with modern computing platforms is not that they are too complex, but that they are no longer designed with the user in mind. Windows, macOS, iOS; they&#8217;re all first and foremost designed to extract money from you through ads, upsells, nag screens, and similar anti-user features, and it&#8217;s those things that people are sick of. Coincidentally, they are all things we didn&#8217;t have to deal with back in the &#8217;80s and &#8217;90s. In other words, remove the user-hostility from modern operating systems, and people wouldn&#8217;t complain about them so much. Which seems rather obvious, doesn&#8217;t it? It&#8217;s why using a Linux desktop like Fedora is such a breath of fresh air. There&#8217;s no upsells for cloud storage or streaming services, no restrictions on what I can and cannot install to protect some multitrillion euro company&#8217;s revenue streams, no ads and nag screens infesting my operating system &#8211; it&#8217;s just an operating system waiting for me to tell it what it do, and then it does it. It&#8217;s wild how increasingly revolutionary that&#8217;s becoming. Whenever I am forced to interact with Windows 11 or whatever the current version of macOS is, I feel such a profound and deep sadness for what they&#8217;ve become, and it seems only natural to me that this sadness is fueling a longing for back when these systems weren&#8217;t so user-hostile.

## Render a Guitar Pro score in real time on Linux

date: 2025-05-19, from: OS News

Tuxguitar is a quite powerful application written in a mixture of Java / C. It is able to render a score in real time either via Fluidsynth or via pure MIDI. The development of Tuxguitar started in 2008 on Sourceforce and after a halt in 2022, the project restarted on Github and is still actively developed. The goal of this article is to try to render a score via Tuxguitar, and various other applications connected to Tuxguitar, via Jack or Pipewire-Jack. The score used throughout this article will be The Pursuit Of Vikings by the band Amon Amarth. It has 2 guitars, a bass and a drum track. ↫ Yann Collette at Fedora Magazine If you&#8217;re into audio production and are considering using Linux for your audio needs, this article is a good starting point.

## What were the MS-DOS programs that the moricons.dll icons were intended for?

date: 2025-05-18, from: OS News

Last time, we looked at the legacy icons in progman.exe. But what about moricons.dll? Here’s a table of the icons that were present in the original Windows 3.1 moricons.dll file (in file order) and the programs that Windows used the icons for. As with the icons in progman.exe, these icons are mapped from executables according to the information in the APPS.INF file. ↫ Raymond Chen These icons age like a fine wine. They&#8217;re clear, well-designed, easy to read, and make extraordinary good use of the limited amount of available pixels. Icons from Mac OS, BeOS, OS/2, and a few others from the same era also look timeless, and I wish modern designers learned a thing or two from these.
