## Microsoft is paywalling features in Notepad and Paint

date: 2025-02-21, from: OS News

There’s some bad news for Windows users who want to use all of the built-in features of the operating system and its integrated apps. Going forward, Microsoft is restricting features in two iconic apps, which you’ll need to unlock with a paid subscription. The two apps in question? Notepad and Paint.  Windows Insiders were previously able to use these app features free of charge. However, Microsoft is now making it necessary to have a Microsoft 365 subscription for full use of these apps. You’ll see a new overlay that informs you of this before use. In our case, however, the respective features were simply grayed out. ↫ Laura Pippig at PCWorld It&#8217;s only the &#8220;AI&#8221; features that are being paywalled here, so I doubt many people will care. What does feel unpleasent, though, is that the features are visible but greyed out, instead of being absent entirely until you log into Windows with an account that has a Microsogt 365 subscription with the &#8220;AI&#8221; stuff enabled. Now it just feels like the operating system you paid good money for &#8211; and yes, you do actually pay for Windows &#8211; is incomplete and badgering you for in-app purchases. The gameification of Windows continues. There&#8217;s also a y in the day, so we have another Ars Technica article detailing the long list of steps you need to take to make Windows suck just a little less. The article is long, and seems to grow longer every time Ars, or any other site for that matter, posts an updated version. I installed Windows 11 on my XPS 13 9370 a few weeks ago to see just how bad things had gotten, and the amount of work I had to do to make Windows 11 even remotely usable was insane. Even the installation alone &#8211; including all the updates &#8211; took several hours, compared to a full installation of, say, Fedora KDE, which, including updated, takes like 10 minutes to install on the same machine. I personally used WinScript to make the process of unfucking Windows 11 less cumbersome, and I can heartedly recommend it to anyone else forced to use Windows 11. Luckily for me, a brand new laptop is being delivered today, without an operating system preinstalled. Can&#8217;t wait to install Fedora KDE and be good to go in like 20 minutes after unboxing the thing.

## Chromium Ozone/Wayland: the last mile stretch

date: 2025-02-21, from: OS News

Lets start with some context, the project consists of implementing, shipping and maintaining native Wayland support in the Chromium project. Our team at Igalia has been leading the effort since it was first merged upstream back in 2016. For more historical context, there are a few blog posts and this amazing talk, by my colleagues Antonio Gomes and Max Ihlenfeldt, presented at last year’s Web Engines Hackfest. Especially due to the Lacros project, progresses on Linux Desktop has been slower over the last few years. Fortunately, the scenario changed since last year, when a new sponsor came up and made it possible to address most of the outstanding missing features and issues required to move Ozone Wayland to the finish line. ↫ Nick Yamane There still quite a bit of work left to do, but a lot of progress has been made. As usual, Nvidia setups are problematic, which is a recurring theme for pretty much anything Wayland-related. Aside from the usual Nvidia problems, a lot of work has been done on improving and fixing fractional scaling, adding support for the text-input-v3 protocol, reimplementing tab dragging using the proper Wayland protocol, and a lot more. They&#8217;re also working on session management, which is very welcome for Chrome/Chromium users as it will allow the browser to remember window positions properly between restarts. Work is also being done to get Chromium’s interactive UI tests infrastructure and code working with Wayland compositors, with a focus on GNOME/Mutter &#8211; no word on KDE&#8217;s Kwin, though. I hope they get the last wrinkles worked out quick. The most popular browser needs to support Wayland out of the box.

## 1972 UNIX V2 “beta” resurrected from old tapes

date: 2025-02-20, from: OS News

There&#8217;s a number of backups of old DECtapes from Dennis Ritchie, which he gave to Warren Toomey in 1997. The tapes were eventually uploaded, and through analysis performed by Yufeng Gao, a lot of additional details, code, and software were recovered from them. A few days ago, Gao came back with the results from their analys of two more tapes, and on it, they found something quite special. Getting this recovered version to run was a bit of a challenge, and only aap&#8217;s PDP-11 emulator is capable of running it. To even get it to run in the first place, Gao had perform quite some intricate steps, but eventually he managed to build an image that can be downloaded and booted on aap&#8217;s PDP-11 emulator. The image in question, as well as some more details, can be found on the GitHub page.

## Mozilla once again confirms it’s all about ads and “AI” now

date: 2025-02-20, from: OS News

We’ve recognized that Mozilla faces major headwinds in terms of both financial growth and mission impact. While Firefox remains the core of what we do, we also need to take steps to diversify: investing in privacy-respecting advertising to grow new revenue in the near term; developing trustworthy, open source AI to ensure technical and product relevance in the mid term; and creating online fundraising campaigns that will draw a bigger circle of supporters over the long run. Mozilla’s impact and survival depend on us simultaneously strengthening Firefox AND finding new sources of revenue AND manifesting our mission in fresh ways. That is why we’re working hard on all of these fronts. ↫ Mark Surman on the Mozilla blog None of this is new to anyone reading OSNews. I&#8217;ve been quite vocal about Mozilla&#8217;s troubles and how it intends to address those troubles, and I&#8217;m incredibly worried and concerned about the increasing efforts by Mozilla to push advertising and &#8220;AI&#8221; to somehow find more revenue streams. I think this is the wrong direction to take, and will not make up for the seemingly inevitable loss of the Google search deal &#8211; and my biggest fear is that Firefox will get a lot worse before Mozilla realises advertising and &#8220;AI&#8221; just aren&#8217;t compatible with their mission and the morals and values of the last few remaining Firefox users. I don&#8217;t have any answers either, of course. Making a competitive browser is hard, and clearly requires a lot of people and a lot of time. Donations are fickle, nobody will pay for a browser, and relying on corporate sponsoring in other forms than the Google search deal will just mean Firefox will become like Chrome even faster, with more and more exceptions for &#8220;allowed&#8221; ads and additional roadblocks for adblockers to try and work around. In essence, I strongly believe that it is impossible to both earn money from online ads and make a good browser. It&#8217;s one or the other &#8211; not both. There&#8217;s basically no competition in the browser space, and if we lose Firefox, the only other option is Chrome and its various skins. Not a future I&#8217;m looking forward to.

## The generative AI con

date: 2025-02-19, from: OS News

Everywhere you look, the media is telling you that OpenAI and their ilk are the future, that they&#8217;re building &#8220;advanced artificial intelligence&#8221; that can take &#8220;human-like actions,&#8221; but when you look at any of this shit for more than two seconds it&#8217;s abundantly clear that it absolutely isn&#8217;t and absolutely can&#8217;t. Despite the hype, the marketing, the tens of thousands of media articles, the trillions of dollars in market capitalization, none of this feels real, or at least real enough to sustain this miserable, specious bubble. People like Marc Benioff claiming that &#8220;today&#8217;s CEOs are the last to manage all-human workforces&#8221; are doing so to pump up their stocks rather than build anything approaching a real product. These men are constantly lying as a means of sustaining hype, never actually discussing the products they sell in the year 2025, because then they&#8217;d have to say &#8220;what if a chatbot, a thing you already have, was more expensive?&#8221; ↫ Edward Zitron Looking at the data and numbers, as Zitron did for this article, the conclusions are sobering and harsh for anyone still pushing the &#8220;AI&#8221; bubble. Products aren&#8217;t really getting any better, they&#8217;re not making any money because very few people are paying for them, conversion rates are abysmal, the reported user numbers don&#8217;t add up, the projections from &#8220;AI&#8221; companies are batshit insane, new products they&#8217;re releasing are shit, and the media are eating it up because they stand to benefit from the empty promises. Generative AI is a financial, ecological and social time bomb, and I believe that it&#8217;s fundamentally damaging the relationship between the tech industry and society, while also shining a glaring, blinding light on the disconnection between the powerful and regular people. The fact that Sam Altman can ship such mediocre software and get more coverage and attention than every meaningful scientific breakthrough of the last five years combined is a sign that our society is sick, our media is broken, and that the tech industry thinks we&#8217;re all fucking morons. This entire bubble has been inflated by hype, and by outright lies by people like Sam Altman and Dario Amodei, their lies perpetuated by a tech media that&#8217;s incapable of writing down what&#8217;s happening in front of their faces. Altman and Amodei are raising billions and burning our planet based on the idea that their mediocre cloud software products will somehow wake up and automate our entire lives. ↫ Edward Zitron In a just world, these 21st century snake oil salesmen would be in prison.

## Broadcom, TSMC weigh possible Intel deals that would split storied chip maker

date: 2025-02-19, from: OS News

Broadcom has been closely examining Intel’s chip-design and marketing business, according to people familiar with the matter. It has informally discussed with its advisers making a bid but would likely only do so if it finds a partner for Intel’s manufacturing business, the people said.&#160; Nothing has been submitted to Intel, the people cautioned, and Broadcom could decide not to seek a deal.&#160; Separately, TSMC has studied controlling some or all of Intel’s chip plants, potentially as part of an investor consortium or other structure, according to people familiar with the discussions. ↫ Asa Fitch, Lauren Thomas, and Yang Jie at The WSJ The vultures continue to circle, but considering Intel isn&#8217;t actually dead yet, it does all feel a little bit premature. The company needs time to right the ship, but with its current non-technical, finance-oriented leadership it might already be too late for such time to be given to the company. For all we know, they&#8217;re already working on a big payday through divestment or wholesale selling of the company, and they&#8217;re just waiting on the right offer. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a good idea to let Intel be stripped for parts and looted by the ultra-wealthy, but with the United States hurdling towards a massive constitutional crisis and experiencing utter destruction of government institutions, I don&#8217;t think anyone&#8217;s left to stop it or think things through properly.

## Humane is shutting down the AI Pin and selling its remnants to HP

date: 2025-02-19, from: OS News

Humane is selling most of its company to HP for $116 million and will stop selling AI Pin, the company announced today. AI Pins that have already been purchased will continue to function normally until 3PM ET on February 28th, Humane says in a support document. After that date, Pins will “no longer connect to Humane’s servers.” As a result, AI Pin features will “no longer include calling, messaging, AI queries / responses, or cloud access.” Humane is also encouraging users to download any pictures, videos, and notes stored on their Pins before they are permanently deleted at that shutdown time. ↫ Jay Peters at The Verge I can&#8217;t think of a better example of &#8220;AI&#8221; being a planet-cooking hype bubble than the Humane failure everybody saw coming from a mile away. HP can add this useless acquisition next to the Palm one.

Since I don&#8217;t think much is known about what, exactly, Arca Noae, and eComStation before it, has access to within the licensing agreement with IBM, it&#8217;s difficult to ascertain just how much room they actually have to make changes to the code at the core of the old OS/2. Regardless, I tested ArcaOS 5.1 before and during its release, and the support for UEFI and GPT partition layouts was excellent on my machines. Almost 18 months later comes the next release in the 5.1 branch, ArcaOS 5.1.1, and as the version number implies, this isn&#8217;t another major release on the scale of 5.1. Looking at the list of changes, it mostly contains a ton of upgraded versions of various programs and tools included in ArcaOS. After some digging into some of those upgraded versions, I think I can safely say we&#8217;re looking at a ton of small bugfixes, but there are also a few other things that stand out to me as welcome changes. For instance, the changelog mentions various improvements to the installer and related tools, such as an improved method of determining the right screen resolution and font scaling during the installation. Considering I had to deal with some issues there &#8211; I think the installer UI elements were grossly oversized &#8211; this is a welcome fix. There are also &#8220;refreshed&#8221; Firefox and Thunderbird builds, although I don&#8217;t know if that means an update to the latest ESR releases, or just a rebuild of what was already shipping with ArcaOS 5.1. I never found the time around the 5.1 release to do a proper review &#8211; I was knee-deep in baby and toddler care overload at the time &#8211; but if Arca Noae is willing to provide me with a 5.1.1 copy, I should be able to actually review it now that I&#8217;m only ankle-deep in baby and toddler care overload.

## UNIX man pages

date: 2025-02-17, from: OS News

What might be somewhat more surprising though considering its research origins is that Unix almost since the very beginning had a comprehensive set of online reference documentation for all its commands, system calls, file formats, etc. These are the the manual- or man-pages. On Unix systems used interactively, the man-pages have historically always been installed, space permitting.  The way the manual pages have evolved and how they are used has changed over the decades. This set of posts is intended to give people unfamiliar with them an overview, as well as offer a review to seasoned users. ↫ Alex Bochannek Right in this first article in the series there&#8217;s an interesting observation I never stopped and thought about: because the original creators of UNIX were writing the content of man pages with the very tools they were creating for UNIX, it led to a virtuous cycle. &#8220;Unix tools were used to document Unix, improving the documentation tools themselves as well.&#8221; I tend to use the internet now to learn how specific tools and commands work, but having such detailed man pages built right into the operating system was a huge deal pre-internet.

## Did the Windows 95 setup team forget that MS-DOS can do graphics?

date: 2025-02-17, from: OS News

One of the reactions to my discussion of why Windows 95 setup used three operating systems (and oh there were many) was my explanation that an MS-DOS based setup program would be text-mode. But c’mon, MS-DOS could do graphics! Are you just a bunch of morons? Yes, MS-DOS could do graphics, in the sense that it didn’t actively prevent you from doing graphics. You were still responsible for everything yourself, though. There were no graphics primitives aside from a BIOS call to plot a single pixel. Everything else was on you, and you didn’t want to use the BIOS call to plot pixels anyway because it was slow. If you wanted any modicum of performance, you had to access the frame buffer directly. ↫ Raymond Chen And with everything the Windows 95 setup program needs that you&#8217;d have to create, you&#8217;d end up just&#8230; Developing a custom operating system in the first place. Since Microsoft already had Windows 3.x lying around, why not reuse parts of that to aid in the Windows 95 installation process? Honestly, all of it makes perfect sense, and I really don&#8217;t understand why anyone would seriously advocate for building a separate, entirely custom operating system just to install Windows 95 when Windows 3.x was right there. Of course, these days things are a little different, but Windows still loads a different operating system during its installation. It&#8217;s called the Windows Preinstallation Environment, but it&#8217;s no longer based on Windows 3.x, obviously, and instead is a cut-down version of the Windows version you&#8217;re actually installing. The latest version of Windows PE is 10.0.26100.1, and it&#8217;s built from Windows 11 24H2. Windows PE also powers the Windows Recovery Environment, the menu you can boot into to perform various analyses, maintenance, and repair of your Windows installation. Since Microsoft does not want Windows PE to be used a general purpose operating system, it comes with a few interesting limitations you can&#8217;t really circumvent. It has a non-configurable 72-hour time bomb, after which if will just shut off, and since PE runs entirely in memory, no changes are saved &#8211; unless you make any changes during the creation of the PE image. It also makes use of FAT32, so there&#8217;s a whole host of limitations there, and there&#8217;s a few other things Microsoft disabled. Since you an add drivers to a PE image, though, I wonder if you could sneak in a file system driver and circumvent FAT32&#8217;s limitations that way?
