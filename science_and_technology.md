## Redox gets services management, completes userspace process manager

date: 2025-05-06, from: OS News

Can someone please stop these months from coming and going, because I&#8217;m getting dizzy with yet another monthly report of all the progress made by Redox. Aside from the usual swath of improvements to the kernel, relibc, drivers, and so on, this month saw the completion of the userspace process manager. In monolithic kernels this management is done in the kernel, resulting in necessary ambient authority, and possibly constrained interfaces if a stable ABI is to be guaranteed. With this userspace implementation, it will be easier to manage access rights using capabilities, reduce kernel bugs by keeping it simpler, and make changes where both sides of the interface can be updated simultaneously. ↫ Ribbon and Ron Williams Students at Georgia Tech have been hard at work this winter on Redox as well, building a system health monitoring and recovery daemon and user interface. The Redox team has also done a lot of work to improve the build infrastructure, fixing a number of related issues along the way. The sudo daemon has now replaced the setuid bit for improved user authentication security, and a ton of existing ports have been fixed and updated where needed. Redox&#8217; monthly progress is kind of stunning, and it&#8217;s clear there&#8217;s a lot of interesting in the Rust-based operating system from outside the project itself as well. I wonder at what point Redox becomes usable for at least some daily, end-user tasks. I think it&#8217;s not quite there yet, especially when it comes to hardware support, but I feel like it&#8217;s getting there faster than anyone anticipated.

## Google accidentally reveals Android’s Material 3 Expressive interface ahead of I/O

date: 2025-05-06, from: OS News

Google&#8217;s accelerated Android release cycle will soon deliver a new version of the software, and it might look quite different from what you&#8217;d expect. Amid rumors of a major UI overhaul, Google seems to have accidentally published a blog post detailing &#8220;Material 3 Expressive,&#8221; which we expect to see revealed at I/O later this month. Google quickly removed the post from its design site, but not before the Internet Archive saved it. ↫ Ryan Whitwam at Ars Technica Google seems to be very keen on letting us know this new redesign is based on a lot of user research and metrics, which always sets off alarm bells in my mind when it comes to user interfaces. Every single person uses their smartphone and its applications a little differently, and using tons of metrics and data to average all of this out can make it so that anyone who strays to far from that average is going to have a bad time. This is compounded by the fact that each and every one of us is going to stray form the average in at least a few places. Google also seems to be throwing consistency entirely out of the window with this redesign, which chills me to the bone. One of the reasons I like the current iteration of Material Design so much is that it does a great job of visually (and to a less extent, behaviourally) unifying the operating system and the applications you use, which I personally find incredibly valuable. I very much prefer consistency over disparate branding, and the screenshots and wording I&#8217;m seeing here seem to indicate Google considers that a problem that needs fixing. As with everything UI, screenshots don&#8217;t tell the whole story, so maybe it won&#8217;t be so bad. I mean, it&#8217;s not like I&#8217;ve got anywhere else to go in case Google messes this up. Monopolies (or duopolies) are fun.

## NASA’s IXPE Reveals X-ray-Generating Particles in Black Hole Jets

## IBM unveils the LinuxONE Emperor 5

date: 2025-05-06, from: OS News

Following the recent release of the IBM z17 mainframe, IBM today unveiled the LinuxONE Emperor 5, which packs much of the same hardware as the z17, but focused on Linux use. Today we&#8217;re announcing IBM LinuxONE 5, performant Linux computing platform for data, applications and your trusted AI, powered by the IBM Telum II processor with built-in AI acceleration. This launch comes at a pivotal time, as technology leaders focus on three critical imperatives: enabling security, improving cost-efficiency, and integrating AI into enterprise systems. ↫ Marcel Mitran and Tina Tarquinio Yes, much like the z17, the LinuxONE 5 is a huge &#8220;AI&#8221; buzzword bonanza, but that&#8217;s to be expected in this day and age. The LinuxONE 5, which, again, few of us will ever get to work with, officially supports Red Hat, OpenSUSE, and Ubuntu, but a variety of other Linux distributions offers support for IBM&#8217;s Z hardware, as well.

## Building your own Atomic (bootc) Desktop

date: 2025-05-05, from: OS News

Bootc and associated tools provide the basis for building a personalised desktop. This article will describe the process to build your own custom installation. ↫ Daniel Mendizabal at Fedora Magazine The fact that atomic distributions make it relatively easy to create custom &#8220;distributions&#8221; is s really interesting bonus quality of these types of Linux distributions. The developers behind Blue95, which we talked about a few weeks ago, based their entire distribution on this bootc personalised desktop approach using Fedora, and they argue that the term &#8220;distribution&#8221; probably isn&#8217;t the correct term here: Blue95 is a collection of scripts and YAML files cobbled together to produce a Containerfile, which is built via GitHub Actions and published to the GitHub Container Registry. Which part of this process elevates the project to the status of a Linux distribution? What set of RUN commands in the Containerfile take the project from being merely a Fedora-based OCI image to a full-blown Linux distribution? ↫ Adam Fidel While this discussion is mostly academic, I still find it interesting how with the march of technology, and with the aid of new ideas, it&#8217;s becoming easier and easier to spin up a customised version of you favourite Linux distribution, making it incredibly easy to have your own personal ISO, with all your settings, themes, and customisations applied. This has always been possible, but it seems to be getting easier. Atomic, immutable distributions are not for me, personally, but I firmly believe most distributions focusing on average, normal users &#8211; Ubuntu, Fedora, SUSE &#8211; will eventually move their immutable variants to the prime spot on their web sites. This will make a whole lot of people big mad, but I think it&#8217;s inevitable. Of course, traditional Linux distributions won&#8217;t be going away, but much like how people keep complaining about systemd despite the tons alternatives, I&#8217;m guessing the same will happen with immutable distributions.

## GTK markup language Blueprint becomes part of GNOME

date: 2025-05-05, from: OS News

This week&#8217;s This Week in GNOME mentions that Blueprint will become part of GNOME. Blueprint is now part of the GNOME Nightly SDK and is expected to be part of the GNOME 49 SDK. This means, apps relying on Blueprint won’t have to install it manually anymore. Blueprint is an alternative to defining GTK/Libadwaita user interface via .ui XML-files (GTK Builder files). The goal of blueprint is to provide UI definitions that require less boilerplate than XML and are easier to learn. Blueprint also provides a language server for IDE integration. ↫ Sophie Herold Quite a few applications already make use of Blueprint, and even some Core GNOME applications use it, so it seems logical to make it part of the default GNOME installation.
