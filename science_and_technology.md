## Microsoft blinks, extends Office support for Windows 10 by three years

date: 2025-05-13, from: OS News

At the start of this year, Microsoft announced that, alongside the end of support for Windows 10, it would also end support for Office 365 (it&#8217;s called Microsoft 365 now but that makes no sense to me) on Windows 10 around the same time. The various Office applications would continue to work on Windows 10, of course, but would no longer receive bug fixes, security plugs, and so on. Well, it seems Microsoft experienced some pushback on this one, because it just extended this end-of-support deadline for Office 365 on Windows 10 by an additional three years. To help maintain security while you transition to Windows 11, Microsoft will continue providing security updates for Microsoft 365 Apps on Windows 10 for three years after Windows 10 reaches end of support. These updates will be delivered through the standard update channels, ending on October 10, 2028. ↫ Microsoft support article The reality is that the vast majority of Windows users are still using Windows 10, and despite countless shady shenanigans and promises of &#8220;AI&#8221; bliss, there&#8217;s relatively little movement in the breakdown between Windows 10 and Windows 11 users. As such, the idea that Microsoft would just stop fixing security issues and bugs in Office on Windows 10 a few months from now seemed preposterous from the outset, and that seems to have penetrated the walls of Microsoft&#8217;s executives, too. The real question now is: will Microsoft extend the same courtesy to Windows 10 itself? The clock is ticking, there&#8217;s only a few months left to go before support for Windows 10 ends, leaving 60-70% of Windows users without security fixes and updates. If they blinked with Office, why wouldn&#8217;t they blink with Windows 10, too? Who dares to place a bet?

## Cracking the Dave & Buster’s anomaly

date: 2025-05-13, from: OS News

Let&#8217;s dive into a peculiar bug in iOS. And by that I mean, let&#8217;s follow along as Guilherme Rambo dives into a peculiar bug in iOS. The bug is that, if you try to send an audio message using the Messages app to someone who’s also using the Messages app, and that message happens to include the name “Dave and Buster’s”, the message will never be received. ↫ Guilherme Rambo As I read this first description of the bug, I had no idea what could possibly be causing this. However, once Rambo explained that every audio message is transcribed by Apple into a text version, I immediately assumed what was going on: that &#8220;and&#8221; is throwing up problems because the actual name of the brand is stylised with an ampersand, isn&#8217;t it? It&#8217;s always DNS HTML, isn&#8217;t it? Yes. Yes it is. MessagesBlastDoorService uses MBDXMLParserContext (via MBDHTMLToSuperParserContext) to parse XHTML for the audio message. Ampersands have special meaning in XML/HTML and must be escaped, so the correct way to represent the transcription in HTML would have been "Dave &#38;amp;amp; Buster's". Apple&#8217;s transcription system is not doing that, causing the parser to attempt to detect a special code after the ampersand, and since there&#8217;s no valid special code nor semicolon terminating what it thinks is an HTML entity, it detects an error and stops parsing the content. ↫ Guilherme Rambo It must be somewhat of a relief to programmers and developers the world over that even a company as large and filled with talented people as Apple can run into bugs like this.

## Linux removes support for the 486, and now I’m curious what that means for Vortex86 processors

date: 2025-05-12, from: OS News

I had to dig through our extensive archive &#8211; OSNews was founded in 1997, after all &#8211; to see if we reported on it at the time, but it turns out we didn&#8217;t: in 2006, Intel announced that in 2007, it would cease production of a range of old chips, including the 386 and 486. In Product Change Notification 106013-01, Intel proclaimed these chips dead. Intel Corporation has been manufacturing its MCS 51, MCS 251 and MCS 96 Microcontroller Product Lines for over 25 years now, and the Intel 186 Processor Families, the Intel 386 Processor Families and the Intel 486 Processor Families for over 15 years now. Additionally, we have been manufacturing the i960 32 Bit RISC Processor Families for over 15 years. However, at this time, the forecasted volumes for these product lines are now too low to continue production of these products beyond the year 2007. Therefore, Intel will cease manufacturing silicon wafers for our 6&#8243; based processes in 2007. Affected products include Intel&#8217;s MCS 51, MCS 251, MCS 96, 80X18X, 80X38X, 80X486DXX, the i960 Family of Microcomputers, in addition to the 82371SB, 82439TX and the 82439HX Chipsets. Intel has no choice but to issue a Product Discontinuance Notice (PDN) effective 3/30/06. Last time orders will be accepted till 3/30/07 with last time ship dates of 9/28/07. ↫ Intel Product Change Notification 106013-01 Considering the 386, 486, and i960 families of processors were only used for niche embedded at very low volumes at that point in time, it made sense to call it quits. We&#8217;re 18 years down the line now, and I don&#8217;t think anyone really mourns the end of production for these processors. Windows ended support for these chips well before the 2007 end of production date, with Windows 2000 being the last Windows version that would run on a 486, albeit only barely, since it officially required a Pentium processor. Linux, though, continued to support the 486, but that, too, is now coming to an end. In a patch submitted to the LKML, Ingo Molnár, support for a variety of &#8220;complicated hardware emulation facilities&#8221; for x86-32 will be removed, effectively ending support for 486 and very early 586 processors, by increasing the minimum kernel support features to include TSC and CX8 (CMPXCHG8B) hardware support. Linus Torvalds has expressed interest in removing support for the 486 back in 2022, so this move doesn&#8217;t come as a huge surprise. While most tech news outlets leave it at that, as I was reading this news, I immediately thought of the Vortex86 line of processors and what this would mean for Linux support for those processors. In case you&#8217;re unaware, the Vortex86 is a line of x86-32-compatible processors, originating at SiS, but now developed and produced by DMP Electronics in Taiwain. The last two variants were the Vortex86DX3, a dual-core chip running at 1Ghz, and the Vortex86EX2, a chip with two asymmetrical cores that can run two operating systems at once. Their platform support documents for Windows and Linux are from 2021, so we can&#8217;t rely on those for more information. Digging through some of the documentation from ICOP, who sell industrial PCs based on the latest Vortex86DX3, I think support in modern kernels is very much hit and miss even before this news. All Vortex86 processors are supposedly i586 (with later variants being i686, even), but some of the earlier versions were compatible with the 486SX. On top of that, Linux 4.14 seems to be the last kernel that supports any of these chips out-of-the-box based on the documentation by DMP &#8211; but then, if you go back to ICOP, you&#8217;ll find news items about Linux 5.16 adding better support for Vortex86, so I&#8217;m definitely confused. My uneducated guess is that the DX3 and EX2 will probably work even after these changes to the Linux kernel, but earlier models might have more problems. Even on the LKML I can find messages from the kind of people who know their stuff who don&#8217;t know all the ins and outs of these Vortex86 processors, and which instructions they actually support. It won&#8217;t matter much for people relying on Vortex86 processors in industrial and commercial settings, though, since they tend to use custom stacks built by the vendor, so they&#8217;re going to be just fine. What&#8217;s more interesting is the what I assume is a small enthusiast market using Vortex86 processors who might want to run modern Linux kernels on them. I have a feeling these code removals might lead to some issues on especially the earlier models, meaning you&#8217;ll have to use older kernels. I&#8217;ve always been fascinated by the Vortex86 line of processors, and on numerous occasions I&#8217;ve hovered over the buy button on some industrial PC using the VortexDX3 (or earlier) processor. Let me know if you&#8217;re interested in seeing what this chip can do, and if there&#8217;s enough interest, I can see if I can set a Ko-Fi goal to buy one these and mess around with Windows Embedded/CE, Linux, and god knows what else these things can be made to run.

## A brief history of the numeric keypad

date: 2025-05-12, from: OS News

The title is a lie. This isn&#8217;t brief at all. Picture the keypad of a telephone and calculator side by side. Can you see the subtle difference between the two without resorting to your smartphone? Don’t worry if you can’t recall the design. Most of us are so used to accepting the common interfaces that we tend to overlook the calculator’s inverted key sequence. A calculator has the 7–8–9 buttons at the top whereas a phone uses the 1–2–3 format. Subtle, but puzzling since they serve the same functional goal — input numbers. There’s no logical reason for the inversion if a user operates the interface in the same way. Common sense suggests the reason should be technological constraints. Maybe it’s due to a patent battle between the inventors. Some people may theorize it’s ergonomics. With no clear explanation, I knew history and the evolution of these devices would provide the answer. Which device was invented first? Which keypad influenced the other? Most importantly, who invented the keypad in the first place? ↫ Francesco Bertelli and Manoel do Amara Sometimes, you come across articles that are one-of-a-kind, and this is one of them. Very few people would go to this length to document such a particular thing most people find utterly insignificant, but luckily for us, Francesco Bertelli and Manoel do Amara went all the way with this one. If you want to know anything about the history of the numerical pad and its possibly layouts, this is the place to go. What I&#8217;ve always found fascinating about numerical pads is how effortless the brain can switch between the two most common layouts without really batting an eye. Both layouts seem so ingrained in my brain that it feels like there&#8217;s barely any context-switching involved, and my fingers just effortlessly flow to the correct numbers. Considering numbers tend to confuse me, I wouldn&#8217;t have been at all surprised to find myself having issues switching between the two layouts. What makes this even more interesting is when I consider the number row on the keyboard &#8211; you know, 1 through 0 &#8211; because there I do tend to have a lot of issues finding the right numbers. I don&#8217;t mean it takes seconds or anything like that, but I definitely experience more hiccups working with the number row than with a numerical keypad of either layout.

## A brief history of the BSD Fast FileSystem

date: 2025-05-12, from: OS News

We&#8217;re looking at an article from 2007 here, but I still think it&#8217;s valuable and interesting, especially from a historical perspective. I first started working on the UNIX file system with Bill Joy in the late 1970s. I wrote the Fast File System, now called UFS, in the early 1980s. In this article, I have written a survey of the work that I and others have done to improve the BSD file systems. Much of this research has been incorporated into other file systems. ↫ Marshall Kirk McKusic Variants of UFS are still the default file system in at least NetBSD and OpenBSD, and it&#8217;s one of the two default options in FreeBSD (alongside ZFS). In other words, this article, and the work described therein, is still relevant to this very day.
