## Why Upstart from Ubuntu failed

date: 2025-02-04, from: OS News

Upstart was an event-based replacement for the traditional System V init (sysvinit) system on Ubuntu, introduced to bring a modern and more flexible way of handling system startup and service management. It emerged in the mid-2000s, during a period when sysvinit’s age and limitations were becoming more apparent, especially with regard to concurrency and dependency handling. Upstart was developed by Canonical, the company behind Ubuntu, with the aim of reducing boot times, improving reliability, and making the system initialization process more dynamic. Though at first it seemed likely to become a standard across many distributions, Upstart eventually lost mindshare to systemd and ceased to be Ubuntu’s default init system. ↫ André Machado I think it&#8217;s safe to say systemd won the competition to become the definitive successor so sysvinit on Linux, but Canonical&#8217;s Upstart made a valiant effort, too. However, with a troublesome license, it was doomed from the start, and it didn&#8217;t help that virtually every other major distribution eventually adopted systemd. These days, systemd is the Linux init system, and I personally quite like it (and the crowd turns violent). I find it easy to use and it&#8217;s never given me any issues, but I&#8217;m not a system administrator dealing with complex setups, so my experience with systemd is probably rather limited. It just does its thing in the background on my machines. None of this means there aren&#8217;t any other init systems still being actively developed. There&#8217;s GNU Shepard we talked about recently, runit, OpenRC, and many more. If you don&#8217;t like systemd, there&#8217;s enough alternatives out there.

## The dumb reason why flag emojis aren’t working on your site in Chrome on Windows

date: 2025-02-04, from: OS News

After doing more digging than I feel like I should have needed to, I found my answer: it appears that due to concerns about the fact that acknowledging the existence of certain countries can be perceived as a nominally political stance, Microsoft has opted to just avoid the issue altogether by not including country flag emojis in Windows’ system font. Problem solved! Can you imagine if, *gasp*, your computer could render a Taiwanese or Palestinian flag? The horror! ↫ Ryan Geyer Silicon Valley corporations are nothing if not massive cowards, and this is just another one of the many, many examples that underline this. Firefox solves this by including the flags on its own, but Google refuses to do the same with Chrome, because, you guessed it, Google is also a cowardly organisation. There are some ways around it, as the linked article details, but they&#8217;re all clumsy and cumbersome compared to Microsoft just not being a coward and including proper flag emoji, even if it offends some sensibilities in pro-China or western far-right circles. Your best bet to avoid such corporate cowardice is to switch to better operating systems, like any desktop Linux distribution. Fedora KDE includes both the Taiwanese and Palestinian flags, because the KDE project isn&#8217;t made up of cowards, and I&#8217;m sure the same applies to any GNOME distribution. If your delicate snowflake sensibilities can&#8217;t handle a Palestinian or Taiwanese flag emoji, just don&#8217;t type them. Bitter sidenote: it turns out WordPress, what OSNews uses, doesn&#8217;t like emoji, either. Adding any emoji in this story, from basic ones to the Taiwanese or Palestinian flag, makes it impossible to save or publish the story. I have no idea if this is a WordPress issue, or an issue on our end, since WordPress does mention they have emoji support.

## TuxTape: a kernel livepatching solution

date: 2025-02-04, from: OS News

Geico, an American insurance company, is building a live-patching solution for the Linux kernel, called TuxTape. TuxTape is an in-development kernel livepatching ecosystem that aims to aid in the production and distribution of kpatch patches to vendor-independent kernels. This is done by scraping the Linux CNA mailing list, prioritizing CVEs by severity, and determining applicability of the patches to the configured kernel(s). Applicability of patches is determined by profiling kernel builds to record which files are included in the build process and ignoring CVEs that do not affect files included in kernel builds deployed on the managed fleet. ↫ Presentation by Grayson Guarino and Chris Townsend It seems to me something like live-patching the Linux kernel should be a standardised framework that&#8217;s part of the Linux kernel, and not several random implementations by third parties, one of which is an insurance company. There&#8217;s a base core of functionality for live-patching in the Linux kernel since 4.0, released in 2015, but it&#8217;s extremely limited and requires most of the functionality to be implemented separately, through things like Red Hat&#8217;s kpatch and Oracle&#8217;s Ksplice. Geico is going to release TuxTape as open source, and is encouraging others to adopt and use it. There are various other solutions out there offering similar functionality, so you&#8217;re not spoiled for choice, and I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s advantages and disadvantages to each. I would still prefer if functionality like this is a standard feature of the kernel, not something tied to a specific vendor or implementation.

However, their sensitivity is fundamentally limited by quantum noise, which prevents the detection of extremely faint signals in the most precision-demanding fields.</p><p>As the world marks the 100-year anniversary of the initial development of quantum mechanics with the <a href="https://quantum2025.org/">International Year of Quantum Science and Technology</a>, DARPA’s Intensity-Squeezed Photonic Integration for Revolutionary Detectors (INSPIRED) program is working to break through the quantum noise limit. By harnessing “squeezed light,” INSPIRED seeks to develop compact, cost-effective optical detectors that can operate at unprecedented sensitivities – allowing signals previously buried in quantum noise to be clearly detected.</p><h4>The promise of squeezed light</h4><p>A fundamental concept of quantum mechanics is the Heisenberg principle, which states that due to the inherent nature of quantum systems, it is impossible to simultaneously know both the exact position and momentum of a particle with perfect accuracy – the more precisely one property is known, the greater the uncertainty in the other. With light, the principle also applies to other pairs of properties, such as the amplitude and phase of an electromagnetic wave.</p><p>Squeezed light is a unique quantum state in which the uncertainty of one of these two properties is reduced below the standard quantum noise limit, while the uncertainty in the other is increased to preserve the Heisenberg principle. This “squeezing” minimizes random noise in measurements, enabling the detection of extremely faint signals that would otherwise be imperceptible. Squeezed light systems were first applied to some of the most precise measurements ever performed to boost the sensitivity of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) – resulting in the first observation of gravitational waves and the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics. These detection systems continue to allow LIGO to capture faint signals from distant cosmic events, such as black holes and neutron star collisions.</p><p>Building on this success, INSPIRED aims to translate laboratory-based squeezed light techniques into deployable technology. The program is leveraging advancements in chip-scale photonics to develop compact, integrated squeezed-light sources 40 times quieter than the quantum noise limit. These breakthroughs will then enable the creation of highly sensitive detectors that overcome traditional noise barriers, unlocking new possibilities in fields such as sensing, communication, and quantum computing.</p><h4>INSPIRED’s roadmap</h4><p>INSPIRED is organized into two phases over three years. Phase 1 is focused on developing core squeezed-light components, with participation from eight research teams led by Hewlett Packard Enterprise, RTX BBN Technologies, Inc., Stanford University, University of Massachusetts at Amherst, University of California, Santa Barbara, University of Southern California, University of Virginia, and Yale University. To kick off the program, DARPA gathered the INSPIRED teams at the LIGO Hanford Observatory in the southeast of Washington state.</p><p>“By taking squeezed light capabilities out of the lab, we aim to drive breakthroughs across defense, scientific, and commercial applications,” said Dr. Justin Cohen, program manager in DARPA’s Microsystems Sciences Office. “Commencing the INSPIRED program at the LIGO Observatory reflects our commitment to uncovering what’s possible when we push the limits of technology through collaboration and vision.”</p><p>The anticipated culmination of INSPIRED’s efforts in Phase 2 is a complete squeezed-light detector, housed within a module the size of a deck of cards.</p><p>Visit the <a href="https://drupal.darpa.mil/research/programs/intensity-squeezed-photonic">INSPIRED program page</a> for further information.</p><p class="text-align-center">###</p><p class="text-align-center">Media with inquiries should contact DARPA Public Affairs at <a href="mailto:outreach@darpa.mil">outreach@darpa.mil</a><br>&nbsp;</p></div>

## GTK announces X11 deprecation, new Android backend, and much more

date: 2025-02-03, from: OS News

Since a number of GTK developer came together at FOSDEM, the project figured now was as good a time as any to give an update on what&#8217;s coming in GTK. First, GTK is implementing some hard cut-offs for old platforms &#8211; Windows 10 and macOS 10.15 are now the oldest supported versions, which will make development quite a bit easier and will simplify several parts of the codebase. Windows 10 was released in 2015 and macOS 10.15 in 2019, which are fair cut-off points, in my book. GTK 4.18 will also bring major accessibility improvements with the AccessKit backend, giving GTK accessibility features on Windows and macOS for the first time, which is great news. Another major new feature is the new Android backend, which, while not yet complete, will allow you to run GTK applications on Android. Do note that this is experimental, so don&#8217;t expect everything to work without any issues quite yet. Lastly, the news that everyone was freaking out about over the weekend: the X11 backend has been deprecated, and will be removed in GTK 5. This freaked a lot of people out, but note that this doesn&#8217;t mean you magically can&#8217;t use GTK 4 applications on X11 anymore &#8211; it merely means that X11 support will be removed in GTK 5, which doesn&#8217;t even exist yet, and with GTK 4 being supported until GTK 6 is released, people using legacy windowing systems like Xorg will be fine for a long time to come. As the GTK project notes on Fedi: The X11 backend being deprecated mainly means that we&#8217;re not going to spend time implementing new features, like dmabuf, graphics offloading, or Vulkan support. X11 support will still exist until GTK4 is EOL, which will happen once GTK *6* is released. We&#8217;re talking about a 20 years horizon, at this point&#8230;  Of course, somebody could show up tomorrow, and implement everything that the Wayland backend does, but for X11. We can always undeprecate things. We are not holding our breath, though… ↫ The GTK project on Fedi This is the right move, and I&#8217;m glad the GTK project is doing this, and is giving everyone ample time to prepare. A lot of people will still freak out, get mad, and scream bloody murder at certain individuals in the wider Linux community, and those people are, of course, free to start working on Xorg. Like the GTK developers, though, I&#8217;m not holding my breath, because despite years of excessive Wayland hate, not a single person has stood up to do the work required to keep Xorg going.

## Run Linux inside a PDF file via a RISC-V emulator

date: 2025-02-03, from: OS News

You might expect PDF files to only be comprised of static documents, but surprisingly, the PDF file format supports Javascript with its own separate standard library. Modern browsers (Chromium, Firefox) implement this as part of their PDF engines. However, the APIs that are available in the browser are much more limited. The full specfication for the JS in PDFs was only ever implemented by Adobe Acrobat, and it contains some ridiculous things like the ability to do 3D rendering, make HTTP requests, and detect every monitor connected to the user&#8217;s system. However, on Chromium and other browsers, only a tiny subset of this API was ever implemented, due to obvious security concerns. With this, we can do whatever computation we want, just with some very limited IO. ↫ LinuxPDF GitHub page I&#8217;m both impressed and concerned.

## The GNU Guix System

date: 2025-02-03, from: OS News

GNU Guix is a package manager for GNU/Linux systems. It is designed to give users more control over their general-purpose and specialized computing environments, and make these easier to reproduce over time and deploy to one or many devices. ↫ GNU Guix website Guix is basically GNU&#8217;s approach to a reproducible, functional package manager, very similar to Nix because, well, it&#8217;s based on Nix. GNU also has a Linux distribution built around Nix, the GNU Guix System, which is fully &#8216;libre&#8217; as all things GNU are, and also makes use of the GNU Shepard init system. Both Shepard and Guix make use of Guile. The last release of the GNU Guix System is a few years old already, but it&#8217;s a rolling release, so that&#8217;s not much of an issue. It uses the Linux kernel, but support for GNU Hurd is also being worked on, for whatever that&#8217;s worth. There&#8217;s also a third-party distribution that is built around the same projects, called rde. It focuses on being lightweight, ready for offline use, and minimal distractions. It&#8217;s probably not suitable for most normal users, but if you&#8217;re a power user and you&#8217;re looking for something a little bit different, this could be for you. While it&#8217;s in active development, it&#8217;s considered usable and stable by its creators. I haven&#8217;t tried it yet, but I&#8217;m definitely intrigued by what it has to offer. Nix sucks up a lot of the attention in this space, so it&#8217;s interesting to see some of the alternatives that aim for similar goals.
