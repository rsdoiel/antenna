## Literally Windows on arm: here is Windows running on the Pixel Watch 3

date: 2025-04-02, from: OS News

Right off the bat, there is not that much use for a Pixel Watch with Windows on it. The project, as the maker says, is for &#8220;shits and giggles&#8221; and more like an April Fool&#8217;s joke. However, it shows how capable modern smartwatches are, with the Pixel Watch 3 being powered by a processor with four ARM Cortex A53 cores, 2GB of DDR4X memory, and 32GB of storage. Getting Windows to run on Gustave&#8217;s arm, as you can imagine, took some time and effort of inspecting a rooted boot image, modifying the stock UEFI to run custom UEFI, editing the ACPI table, and patching plenty of other files. The result of all that is a Pixel Watch 3 with Windows PE. ↫ Taras Buria at Neowin More of this sort of nonsense, please. This is such a great idea, especially because it&#8217;s so utterly useless and pointless. However pointless it may be, though, it does show that Windows on ARM is remarkably flexible, as it&#8217;s been ported to a variety of ARM devices it should never be supposed to run on. With Microsoft&#8217;s renewed entry into the ARM world with Windows on ARM and Qualcomm, I would&#8217;ve hoped for more standardisation in the ARM space to bring it closer to the widely compatible world of x86. That, sadly, has not yet happened, and I doubt it ever will &#8211; it seems like ARM is already too big of a fragmented mess to be consolidated for easy portability for operating systems. Instead, individual crazy awesome people have to manually port Windows to other ARM variants, and that, while cool projects, is kind of sad.

## FreeDOS: history, legacy, and a valuable resource for old machines

date: 2025-04-02, from: OS News

FreeDOS is a free and open‐source operating system designed to be compatible with MS‑DOS. Developed to keep the DOS experience alive even after Microsoft ended support for MS‑DOS, FreeDOS has grown into a complete environment that not only preserves classic DOS functionality but also introduces modern enhancements. Its simplicity and low resource requirements have made it a cherished resource for retro computing enthusiasts and a practical tool for embedded systems and legacy hardware. ↫ André Machado A short but useful overview of what FreeDOS is. One of my favourite stories about FreeDOS will always be not just that HP offered it as an option on some of its laptops &#8211; supposedly because it couldn&#8217;t sell laptops without an operating system preinstalled &#8211; but also just how convoluted this preinstalled copy of FreeDOS was set up. They shipped several FreeDOS virtual machines on top of a minimal installation of Debian, in a complex web of operating systems and VMs.

## The 32bit RISC OS needs to be ported to 64bit to survive, seeks help

date: 2025-03-30, from: OS News

RISC OS, the operating system from the United Kingdom originally designed to run on Acorn Computer&#8217;s Archimedes computers &#8211; the first ARM computers &#8211; is still actively developed today. Especially since the introduction of the Raspberry Pi, new life was breathed into this ageing operating system, and it has gained quite a bit of steady momentum ever since, with tons of small updates, applications, and new hardware support, including things like support for wireless networking. This development has always been a bit piecemeal, though, and the pace has never been exceptionally fast. Now, though, time really is ticking for RISC OS: popular RISC OS platforms like the Raspberry Pi are moving to 64bit ARM only, and this poses a big problem for RISC OS: most of it is written in pure 32bit ARM assembly. As you can imagine, the supply of capable 32bit ARM boards is going to dwindle over the coming years, which would put RISC OS right back where it was before the launch of the Raspberry Pi: floundering, relying on old hardware. This is obviously not ideal, and as such, RISC OS Open Limited wants to take a big leap to address this. Since 2011, ROOL has successfully delivered dozens of community-funded improvements through its bounty scheme. While this model has enabled steady progress, it is not suited to the scale of work now required to modernise RISC OS. The Moonshots initiative represents a fundamental shift: focused, multi-year development projects undertaken by full-time engineers. The first Moonshot aims to make the RISC OS source code portable and compatible with 64-bit Arm platforms, a prerequisite for future hardware support. ROOL has already scoped the work, identified key milestones, and built cost models based on realistic employment and project management needs. ↫ Steve Revill in a ROOL press release They&#8217;re going to need a dedicated team of several developers working over the course of several years to port RISC OS to 64bit ARM. That&#8217;s going to require quite a bit of money, manpower, and expertise, and considering ROOL has only collected about £100000 worth of donations over the past 14 years, I can see why they&#8217;re aiming to go big for this effort. All these giant technology corporations with trillion dollar stock valuations are currently relying on ARM technology, so you&#8217;d think they could empty a few socks and cough up a few million to get this effort funded properly, but alas, we all know that&#8217;s not going to happen. I hope ROOL can make this work. RISC OS is a ton of fun to use, and occupies a unique place in computing history. I would be incredibly sad to see technological progress leave it behind, when what amount to chump change for so many wealthy companies and individuals could save it.

## Microsoft makes it even harder to use a local account on Windows 11

date: 2025-03-30, from: OS News

Do you want to install Windows 11 without internet access or without an online Microsoft Account? It seems Microsoft really doesn&#8217;t want you to, as it has removed a very common and popular way of bypassing this requirement. In the release notes for the latest builds from the Dev and Beta channels, the company notes: We’re removing the bypassnro.cmd script from the build to enhance security and user experience of Windows 11. This change ensures that all users exit setup with internet connectivity and a Microsoft Account. Let me blow your minds and state that I don&#8217;t think online accounts for an operating system are inherently a bad idea. I would love it if I could install Fedora KDE on a new machine, optionally log into some online &#8220;Fedora Account&#8221;, and have my customisations and applications synchronise automatically. It would save me some time and effort, and assuming it&#8217;s all properly encrypted and secured, I don&#8217;t think the risk factors are particularly high. The keyword here is, of course, optionally. Microsoft wants every Windows 11 user to have a Microsoft Account instead of a local account, and would rather not make it optional at all. Of course, this is still Microsoft, a company wholly incapable of doing anything right when it comes to operating systems, so even making this script available again during installation is stupidly easy. It took a few nerds mere moments to discover you could just make some registry changes during installation, reboot, and have the script return to its rightful place. Oh Microsoft. Never change.

## Blue95: Fedora Atomic Xfce converted to a Windows 95 desktop

date: 2025-03-30, from: OS News

Blue95 is a modern and lightweight desktop experience that is reminiscent of a bygone era of computing. Based on Fedora Atomic Xfce with the Chicago95 theme. ↫ Blue95 GitHub page Exactly as it says on the tin. This is by far the easiest way to get the excellent Chigaco95 theme for Xfce set up and working in a polished way, and it also contains a few different application choices from the regular Fedora Xfce desktop to improve the illusion even further.

## Microsoft releases Windows 11 roadmap tool to help make sense of Windows 11’s development

date: 2025-03-30, from: OS News

I&#8217;ve complained about the utter inscrutability of the Windows release process for a long time, with Microsoft seemingly using channels, build numbers, code names, date-based version numbers, and so on interchangeably, making it incredibly hard to keep track of what is being released when. It turns out even Microsoft itself started losing track, because it&#8217;s now released a roadmap for Windows 11 development. In the roadmap tool &#8211; of course it&#8217;s a tool &#8211; you can select a platform, which isn&#8217;t x86 or ARM, but Windows PC or Copilot+ PC, a version (23H2 or 24H2 for now), a status (In preview, Gradually rolling out, or Generally available), and a channel (Canary, Dev, Beta, or Retail), after which the roadmap tool will list whatever features match those criteria. Do you now see why people might want such a tool to keep track of what the hell is going on with Windows? Anyway, as the date-based version numbers &#8211; 23H2 and 24H2 &#8211; may already make clear, this seems more like a roadmap about where development&#8217;s been than where development&#8217;s going. The problem for Microsoft, of course, is that it maintains several different Windows variants with different feature sets and update schedules, and users, too, can of course opt to stick to certain versions before moving on. The end result is this spaghetti, which makes it hard to untangle when you&#8217;re getting which feature. Anyway, if you&#8217;re elbow-deep in the Windows spaghetti, this tool may be of use to you.
