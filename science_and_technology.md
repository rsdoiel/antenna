## Xcode phones home a lot, and that should worry you

date: 2025-02-25, from: OS News

I&#8217;ve saved the worst for last. For some reason, Xcode phones home to appstoreconnect.apple.com every time I open an Xcode project. This also appears to be unnecessary, and I experience no problems after denying the connections in Little Snitch, so I do! I assume that the connections send identifying information about the Xcode project to Apple, otherwise why even make the connections when opening a project? And all of these connections from Xcode, to every domain, require login to your Apple Developer account, so Apple is definitely receiving identifying information about you in any case. In effect, Xcode is a developer analytics collection mechanism, whether you like it or not, which I don&#8217;t. ↫ Jeff Johnson If, at this point in time, you&#8217;re still surprised Apple doesn&#8217;t practice what it preaches, the fault lies pretty much entirely with you. Anyway, it seems Xcode phones home to Apple quite a bit, which I doubt is all that unique in the world of commercial development environments. I honestly don&#8217;t think Apple itself doing anything particularly nefarious with this data, but the fact it&#8217;s collecting it in the first place should still make you think twice about using Xcode, especially if you&#8217;re developing anything even remotely sensitive. What should really worry you is the fact Tim Cook and Apple are close allies of Trump and his regime. Xcode is required for iOS/iPadOS/etc. development, because the App Store requires applications be built and submitted with it. As such, every iOS developer is sending substantial amounts of data to Apple during development, which should be especially concerning for people outside of the US and people who aren&#8217;t straight white males; using Xcode requires an Apple Account, so Apple knows quite a bit about who is using it. With the breakdown of the rule of law in the US, all of this data is basically freely accessible to US authorities, and we&#8217;ve seen by now that people like self-styled genius Elon Musk don&#8217;t worry too much about pesky things like the rule of law. If Musk wants this data, Apple will hand it over. If you&#8217;re an Apple developer, you should stop and think every time you open Xcode. You&#8217;re sending your data straight to a hostile entity. If you&#8217;re claiming to use Apple products because of Apple&#8217;s privacy &#8220;promises&#8221;, Xcode&#8217;s data collection should be a huge worry for you.

## Qualcomm gives OEMs the option of 8 years of Android updates

date: 2025-02-25, from: OS News

Starting with Android smartphones running on the Snapdragon 8 Elite Mobile Platform, Qualcomm Technologies now offers device manufacturers the ability to provide support for up to eight consecutive years of Android software and security updates. Smartphones launching on new Snapdragon 8 and 7-series mobile platforms will also be eligible to receive this extended support. ↫ Mike Genewich I mean, good news of course, but Qualcomm has a history of making empty promises, so I&#8217;ll see it when I believe it. Also note that this news doesn&#8217;t mean every Snapdragon 8 Elite Android device will get eight years of updates &#8211; it just means OEMs are able to offer such support now, not that they&#8217;ll actually do it. Considering it&#8217;s usually the OEMs refusing to offer updates, I wonder just how big the actual impact of this news will be. In any event, this includes both regular Android updates as well as two Android Common Kernel upgrades, which are required to meet this eight year window. If you want to get into the nitty-gritty about Android and the Android Common Kernels, the official Android documentation has more details.

## It is no longer safe to move our governments and societies to US clouds

date: 2025-02-24, from: OS News

We now have the bizarre situation that anyone with any sense can see that America is no longer a reliable partner, and that the entire US business world bows to Trump’s dictatorial will, but we STILL are doing everything we can to transfer entire governments and most of our own businesses to their clouds. Not only is it scary to have all your data available to US spying, it is also a huge risk for your business/government continuity. From now on, all our business processes can be brought to a halt with the push of a button in the US. And not only will everything then stop, will we ever get our data back? Or are we being held hostage? This is not a theoretical scenario, something like this has already happened. ↫ Bert Hubert The cold and harsh reality is that the alliance between the United States and Europe, the single-most powerful alliance in human history, is over. Voters in the United States prefer their country ally itself with the brutal and genocidal dictator of Russia, instead of being allied with the democratic and free nations of Europe. That&#8217;s their choice to make, their consequences to face, and inevitably, their cross to bear. Governments in Europe have not yet fully accepted that they can no longer rely on the United States for, well, anything. Whether it be existential, like needing to shore up defense spending and possibly unifying European militaries, or something more mundane, like which computer systems European governments use, the United States should be treated in much the same way as Russia or China. Europe has to fend for itself, spend on itself, and build for itself, instead of assuming that the Americans will come through on any &#8220;promise&#8221; they make. An unreliable partner like the US is a massive liability. Bert Hubert is exactly right. European data needs to be stored within European borders. Just as we wouldn&#8217;t store our data on servers owned or controlled by the Chinese government, we shouldn&#8217;t be storing our data on servers owned or controlled by the US government. The general European public is already changing its buying habits &#8211; it&#8217;s time our governments do so too.

## Sailfish OS 5.0 released for all supported devices

date: 2025-02-24, from: OS News

Sailfish OS 5.0, originally released late last year as part of the new Jolla C2 Community Phone, will now be pushed to all Sailfish OS devices. There have been several other minor releases since the original release, so if you&#8217;re running Sailfish OS on something other than the C2, you&#8217;re getting a release with some more bugfixes and improvements. The main improvement is an upgrade to Gecko ESR91, with work underway to move to ESR102 &#8211; this is far from the latest release, but sticking to ESR releases seems like a wise idea for a smaller team. This release also upgrades the Android application support to Android 13 (API level 33), and adds the microG 0.3.6 enablers. There&#8217;s Wireguard support now, call blocking, and new landscape view for a variety of applications. Incidentally, I was one of the first people to publish a review of the original Jolla Phone, exactly 11 years ago in 2014. Since I was such an early adopter, I have the The First One version, and it just so happens I&#8217;m also one of the very few people who actually received the Jolla Tablet, after being an extremely early backer of that device, too. I still have both of them, and especially the Jolla Phone I used as my main device for quite a while &#8211; half a year to a year, or so &#8211; before going back to Android. I&#8217;m glad Sailfish OS is still going, and I&#8217;m definitely interested in giving this new release a go. I would need to buy the Jolla C2 Community Phone, and if finances allow, I may actually do so. In case you want to help, feel free to become an OSNews Patreon or make a one-time donation through Ko-Fi.

## Microsoft improves Windows 11’s Start menu somewhat

date: 2025-02-24, from: OS News

Microsoft seems to be addressing some of the oddities with the Windows 11 Start menu, finally adding basic views that should&#8217;ve been in Windows 11 since the very start. We’re introducing two new views to the “All” page in the Start menu: grid and category view. Grid and list view shows your apps in alphabetical order and category view groups all your apps into categories, ordered by usage. This change is gradually rolling out so you may not see it right away. We plan to begin rolling this out to Windows Insiders who are receiving updates based on Windows 11, version 24H2 in the Dev and Beta Channels soon. ↫ Amanda Langowski and Brandon LeBlanc These new views are very welcome, but sadly, you still can&#8217;t set them as the default view in the Start menu. You&#8217;re still forced to use whatever that default view is, and click on &#8220;All&#8221; to get to these new views, instead of being available right as you open the Start menu. I messed around with Windows 11 on my XPS 13 9370 for a few weeks as I waited for a review laptop to arrive, and I couldn&#8217;t last for a few hours without buying a replacement for the Start menu that allowed me to have a working, non-terrible menu that I could configure to my own needs. It&#8217;s wild to me that such an iconic element of the Windows user interface is in such a dire, unliked state. We all know Windows seems to be a in a bit of a rut, with Microsoft investing more in nonsense like &#8220;AI&#8221; and ads in the operating system than in actually listening to users and improving their experience. It&#8217;s been roughly thirty years since the introduction of the Start menu, and the original one from Windows 95 is still superior to whatever&#8217;s in Windows now. Wild.

## The DOS 3.3 SYS.COM bug hunt!

date: 2025-02-24, from: OS News

Last year somebody reported a problem with the DOS 3.3 SYS.COM command when used with NetDrive. They started with a valid FAT12 image, ran SYS.COM to make it bootable, and then they were not able to mount the image using NetDrive again. Running SYS.COM against the image had broken something. Besides copying the operating system&#8217;s hidden files to the target drive letter, SYS.COM also copies some boot code into the first sector of the disk. In general it does not make sense to run it against a NetDrive image because you already had to boot DOS to mount the image, but it should not hurt anything. So I decided to have a look at what was going on. ↫ Michael Brutman A good old classic bug hunt in some retro DOS code from roughly 1987. This one&#8217;s a bit more technical and in-depth than these things usually are, and quite a bit of it goes over my head, but I&#8217;m sure since most of you are much smarter than I am, you&#8217;ll do a better job understanding what&#8217;s going on.

## Illumos on SPARC: possible, but problematic

date: 2025-02-23, from: OS News

While SPARC may no longer be supported by the main Illumos project, it still works and is still viable. This page brings together a variety of information regarding Illumos on SPARC, not necessarily limited to Tribblix. ↫ Tribblix website It seems running Tribblix &#8211; and other Illumos-based distributions &#8211; on SPARC is still possible, but there are some serious limitations anyone who has tried to use even slightly older operating systems will be fairly familiar with. For instance, since there&#8217;s no Rust for Illumos on SPARC, Firefox and other applications that use it are not available, and Tribblix in particular no longer builds Pale Moon (or LibreOffice). Rust is available on Solaris 11, though, so it may be possible to bring it to Illumos. In a similar vein, Go also isn&#8217;t available for SPARC either. As far as hardware support goes, it&#8217;s a bit of a mixed bag, as systems that should work do, in fact, not, and even systems that do work run into a very familiar problem: graphics card support is a big issue. This is a problem plaguing X.org on any outdated or sidelined architecture, and it seems Illumos is also affected. Obviously, this greatly reduces the usefulness of Illumos on workstations, but is less of an issue on servers. You&#8217;ll run into the same problem when trying to run NetBSD, OpenBSD, or Linux in, say, PA-RISC hardware. Of course, the problem is both a lack of people interested in and capable of contributing to keeping stuff running on older architectures, further spurred on by a dwindling supply of hardware available at reasonable prices. Sad, but there isn&#8217;t much that can be done about it.
