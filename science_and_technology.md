## Windows Recall failed the moose test, and nobody will ever forget it

date: 2025-04-22, from: OS News

Ars Technica took a look at how the current version of Windows Recall works, including the improvements Microsoft made since the initial security nightmare of a rollout, and concludes: Recall continues to demand an extraordinary level of trust that Microsoft hasn&#8217;t earned. However secure and private it is—and, again, the version people will actually get is much better than the version that caused the original controversy—it just feels creepy to open up the app and see confidential work materials and pictures of your kid. You&#8217;re already trusting Microsoft with those things any time you use your PC, but there&#8217;s something viscerally unsettling about actually seeing evidence that your computer is tracking you, even if you&#8217;re not doing anything you&#8217;re worried about hiding, even if you&#8217;ve excluded certain apps or sites, and even if you &#8220;know&#8221; that part of the reason why Recall requires a Copilot+ PC is because it&#8217;s processing everything locally rather than on a server somewhere. ↫ Andrew Cunningham at Ars Technica Way back in 1996, Mercedes-Benz unveiled the A-Class, a small, practical car that purported to be more premium than cheaper, similarly-sized cars from other brands. The car had a big problem, though &#8211; it was unusually narrow and tall, and because of it, it famously failed spectacularly at the &#8220;moose test&#8221;, in which a car has to suddenly swerve around a &#8220;moose&#8221; on the road. The car simply toppled over, and after initially denying the problem, Mercedes recalled every single A-Class sold and added a variety of mitigations like electronic stability control and suspension changes. As far as I can recall, it fixed the issue. To this day, however, I cannot look at an A-Class, even the modern ones which look like normal hatchbacks and bear effectively zero resemblance to the original, quirky A-Class from 1996, and not think of the failed moose test and the recall. I know the modern A-Class won&#8217;t fail that test, and I know it&#8217;s an infinitely safer car than the original one, but my brain still makes that connection every time I see one. A lot of people my age, whether they&#8217;re into cars or not, seem to remember this recall, because the original A-Class was such a unique and recognisable vehicle at the time, especially coming from Mercedes. My point is &#8211; Recall will face this same issue. No matter how secure Microsoft makes it, no matter how much they claim and prove it only runs locally, no matter how hard they try and hammer on the fact data never leaves your PC, people will always think of that initial botched rollout, and all the accurate reporting that Recall was a nightmare. And it just so happens that the skepticism is warranted, and hopefully keeps people from using this corporate Trojan horse.

## Thanks again to our outgoing sponsor: Nova Custom

date: 2025-04-21, from: OS News

We&#8217;d like to thank our outgoing sponsor, Nova Custom, for sponsoring OSNews! Nova Custom, based in The Netherlands, makes laptops focused on privacy, customisation, and freedom. Nova Custom laptops ship with either Linux, Windows, or no operating system, and they’re uniquely certified for Qubes OS (the V54 model will be certified soon), the ultra-secure and private operating system. On top of that, Nova Custom laptops come with Dasharo coreboot firmware preinstalled, which is completely open source, instead of a proprietary BIOS. Nova Custom can also disable the Intel Management Engine for you, and you can opt for Dasharo coreboot+Heads for the ultimate in boot security. Nova Custom offers visual customisations, too, including engraving a logo or text of your choice on the metal screen lid and/or palmrest and adding your own boot logo. They also offer privacy customisations like removing the microphone and webcam, installing a privacy screen, and more. A small touch I personally appreciate: Nova Custom offers a long, long list of keyboard layouts, as well as the option to customise the super key. Nova Custom products enjoy 3 years of warranty, as well as updates and spare parts for at least seven years after the launch of a product, which includes everything from motherboard replacements down to sets of screws. Nova Custom laptops can be configured with a wide variety of Intel processor options, as well as a choice between integrated Intel GPUs or Nvidia laptop GPUs.

## Let’s give PRO/VENIX a barely adequate, pre-C89 TCP/IP stack (featuring Slirp-CK)

date: 2025-04-21, from: OS News

Only a few weeks ago, I linked to Cameron Kaiser&#8217;s excellent deep dive into the DEC Professional 380 running PRO/VENIX, and now we have a follow-up. Fortunately, today we have AI we have many more excellent and comprehensive documents on the subject, and more importantly, we&#8217;ve recently brought back up an oddball platform that doesn&#8217;t have networking either: our DEC Professional 380 running the System V-based PRO/VENIX V2.0, which you met a couple articles back. The DEC Professionals are a notoriously incompatible member of the PDP-11 family and, short of DECnet (DECNA) support in its unique Professional Operating System, there&#8217;s officially no other way you can get one on a network — let alone the modern Internet. Are we going to let that stop us? ↫ Cameron Kaiser No. The answer is always no. If you&#8217;ve ever wanted to know what&#8217;s involved in setting up a custom TCP/IP stack using serial on a 40 year old UNIX workstation, your very specific desires are hereby met.

## “How I use Kate Editor”

date: 2025-04-21, from: OS News

I love the Kate Text editor. I use it for pretty much all the programming projects I do. Kate has been around for long time now, about 20 years! At least earliest blog post for it I could find was written in 2004. I wanted to go over my workflow with it, why I like it so much and hopefully get more people to try it out. ↫ Akseli Lahtinen Programmers and developers tend to be very set in their ways and have their preferred workflows &#8211; which profession doesn&#8217;t, honestly &#8211; and since there&#8217;s such a wide variety of developer and programming tools out there, it feels like every single developer&#8217;s workflow and setup is entirely unique. Akseli Lahtinen, KDE developer and allround awesome person, details his setup using Kate, the venerable and feature-rich text editor from the KDE project. As someone who can&#8217;t program, I can&#8217;t really compare his workflow to my own, but what I found interesting while reading his post is that there&#8217;s quite a bit of overlap between my previous work as a translator and his work as a developer. While the contents of each individual view inside his Kate window are obviously different, the setup of windows and tools I had when translating looked very similar. This shouldn&#8217;t be surprising to me &#8211; after all, both translating and developing requires multiple work surfaces, language plugins, formatting tools, tons of keyboard shortcuts, and a whole load of browser tabs, PDF files, and other documents to find just the right translation or the perfect term, as well as a ton of background to make sure you understand the topic you&#8217;re translating about. Y&#8217;all have no idea how much I know about the deepest complex inner-workings and processes of some of the largest organisations in the world, just because I needed to study them and had access to their internal documentation and software. I also read and studied way too many complex contracts, European law, and technical studies into medicine and healthcare treatments, and I guess developers and programmers do the same thing &#8211; just focusing on different subjects. What&#8217;s the best way to do this thing in the programming language I&#8217;m using? How does this library I want to integrate work? What are the API endpoints for this service I want to use? It&#8217;s really not that different from translating, and that never really dawned on me until now.

## Synology confirms that higher-end NAS products will require its branded drives

date: 2025-04-21, from: OS News

&#8220;Synology-branded drives will be needed for use in the newly announced Plus series, with plans to update the Product Compatibility List as additional drives can be thoroughly vetted in Synology systems,&#8221; a Synology representative told Ars by email. &#8220;Extensive internal testing has shown that drives that follow a rigorous validation process when paired with Synology systems are at less risk of drive failure and ongoing compatibility issues.&#8221; Without a Synology-branded or approved drive in a device that requires it, NAS devices could fail to create storage pools and lose volume-wide deduplication and lifespan analysis, Synology&#8217;s German press release stated. Similar drive restrictions are already in place for XS Plus and rack-mounted Synology models, though work-arounds exist. ↫ Kevin Purdy at Ars Technica I&#8217;m honestly surprised it&#8217;s taken Synology this long to start nickle-and-diming its users. I&#8217;m sure the &#8220;Synology-branded&#8221; drives will carry substantial markups over regular drives, despite the drives being otherwise identical. Charging insane markups for expansion options is a tried-and-true way to increase your margins, with Apple being the classic example of charging insane prices for basic RAM or SSD upgrades. I think most of us here on OSNews could easily build our own NAS, as it&#8217;s not a particularly complex project. The various software options could be a bit more complicated to navigate, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s insurmountable for most of us. Normal, average people, though, would most likely do best to just buy an off-the-shelf NAS for their storage and local back-up needs, and it&#8217;s those kind of people who Synology is aiming this policy at. They&#8217;ll be easily fooled into thinking Synology-branded drives are somehow special, and not just a generic drive with a fancy sticker. This is how the world works, but that doesn&#8217;t make it any less unpleasant.
