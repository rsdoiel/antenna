## Apple said to switch to year to identify releases of its operating systems

date: 2025-05-28, from: OS News

The next Apple operating systems will be identified by year, rather than with a version number, according to people with knowledge of the matter. That means the current iOS 18 will give way to “iOS 26,” said the people, who asked not to be identified because the plan is still private. Other updates will be known as iPadOS 26, macOS 26, watchOS 26, tvOS 26 and visionOS 26. Apple is making the change to bring consistency to its branding and move away from an approach that can be confusing to customers and developers. Today’s operating systems — including iOS 18, watchOS 12, macOS 15 and visionOS 2 — use different numbers because their initial versions didn’t debut at the same time. ↫ Mark Gurman at Bloomberg OK.

Research V7 had 14-byte filenames, and the System III/System V lineage continued this restriction until it merged with BSD Unix, which had significantly increased this limit as part of moving to a new filesystem (initially called the &#8216;Fast File System&#8217;, for good reasons). You might wonder where this unusual number came from, and for that matter, what the file name limit was on very early Unixes (it was 8 bytes, which surprised me; I vaguely assumed that it had been 14 from the start). ↫ Chris Siebenmann I love these historical explanations for seemingly arbitrary limitations.

## Microsoft unveils Microsoft’s competitor to Microsoft’s winget

date: 2025-05-28, from: OS News

One of the ways in which Windows (and macOS) trails behind the Linux and BSD world is the complete lack of centralised, standardised application management. Windows users still have to scour the web to download sketchy installers straight from the Windows 95 days, amassing a veritable collection updaters in the process, which either continuously run in the background, or annoy you with update pop-ups when you launch an application. It&#8217;s an archaic nightmare users of supposedly modern computers should not have to be dealing with. Microsoft has tried to remedy this, but in true Microsoft fashion, it did so halfheartedly, for instance with the Windows Package Manager, better known as winget. Instead of building an actual package manager, Microsoft basically just created a glorified script that downloads the same installers you download manually, and runs them in unattended mode in the background &#8211; it&#8217;s a download manager masquerading as a proper application management framework. To complicate matters, winget is only available as a command-line tool, meaning 99% of Windows users won&#8217;t be using it. There&#8217;s no graphical frontend in Windows, and it&#8217;s not integrated into Windows Update, so even if you strictly use winget to install your applications &#8211; which will be hard, as there&#8217;s only about 1400 applications that use it &#8211; you still don&#8217;t have a centralised place to upgrade your entire operating system and all of its applications. It&#8217;s a mess, and Microsoft intends to address it. Again. This time, they&#8217;re finally doing what should have been the goal from the start: allowing applications to be updated through Windows Update. Built on the Windows Update stack, the orchestration platform aims to provide developers and product teams building apps and management tools with an API for onboarding their update(s) that supports the needs of their installers. The orchestrator will coordinate across all onboarded products that are updated on Windows 11, in addition to Windows Update, to provide IT admins and users with a consistent management plane and experience, respectively. ↫ Angie Chen on the Windows IT Pro Blog Sounds good, but hold on a minute &#8211; &#8220;orchestration platform&#8221;? So this isn&#8217;t the existing winget, but integrated into Windows Update, where it should&#8217;ve been all along? No, what we&#8217;re looking at here is Microsoft&#8217;s competitor to Microsoft&#8217;s winget inside Microsoft&#8217;s Windows Update, oh and there&#8217;s also the Windows Store. In other words, once this rolls out, it&#8217;ll be yet another way to manage applications, existing inside Windows Update, and alongside winget (and the Windows Store). They way it works is surprisingly similar to winget: application developers can register an update executable with the orchestrator, and the orchestrator will periodically run this update executable to check for updates. In other words, this looks a hell of a lot like a mere download manager for existing updaters. What it&#8217;s definitively not, however, is winget &#8211; so if you&#8217;re a Windows application developer, you now not only have to register your application to work with winget, but also register it with this new orchestrator to work with Windows Update. This thing is so incredibly Microsoft.

## Genode OS Framework 25.05 released

date: 2025-05-28, from: OS News

It&#8217;s been 9 years since we disrupted Genode&#8217;s API. Back then, we changed the execution model of components, consistently applied the dependency-injection pattern to shun global side effects, and largely removed C-isms like format strings and pointers. These changes ultimately paved the ground for sophisticated systems like Sculpt OS. Since then, we identified several potential areas for further safety improvements, unlocked by the evolution of the C++ core language and inspired by the popularization of sum types for error propagation by the Rust community. With the current release, we uplift the framework API to foster a programming style that leaves no possible error condition unconsidered, reaching for a new level of rock-solidness of the framework. Section The Great API hardening explains how we achieved that. The revisited framework API comes in tandem with a new tool chain based on GCC 14 and binutils 2.44. ↫ Genode OS Framework 25.05 release notes This new release also brings a lot of progress on the integration of the TCP/IP stacks ported from Linux and lwIP, improvements to the Intel and VESA drivers, better power management of their Intel GPU multiplexer, and more. They&#8217;ve also added support for touchscreen gestures, file modification times support milliseconds now, and support for the seL4 kernel has been improved. Many of these changes will find their way into the next SculptOS release, or, in some cases, were already added.

## 10biForthOS: a full 8086 OS in 46 bytes

date: 2025-05-27, from: OS News

An incredibly primitive operating system, with just two instructions: compile (1) and execute (0). It is heavily inspired by Frank Sergeant 3-Instruction Forth and is a strip down exercise following up SectorForth, SectorLisp, SectorC (the C compiler used here) and milliForth. Here is the full OS code in 46 bytes of 8086 assembly opcodes. ↫ 10biForthOS sourcehut page Yes, the entire operating system easily fits right here, inside an OSNews quote block: 50b8 8e00 31d8 e8ff 0017 003c 0575 00ea5000 3c00 7401 eb02 e8ee 0005 0588 eb47b8e6 0200 d231 14cd e480 7580 c3f4 ↫ 10biForthOS sourcehut page How do you actually use this operating system? Once the operating system is loaded at boot, it listens on the serial port for instructions. You can then send the instruction 1 followed by a byte of an assembly opcode which will be compiled into a fixed location in memory. The instruction 0 will then execute the program. There&#8217;s also a version with keyboard support, as well as a much bigger version compiled for x86-64. Something like this inevitably raises the question what an operating system really is, and if this extremely limited and minimalist thing can be considered as one. I&#8217;m not going to deep into this existential discussion, mostly because I land firmly on the side that this is indeed just as much an operating system as, say, Windows or MorphOS. This bit of code, when booted, allows you to operate the system. It&#8217;s an operating system.

## Signal uses Windows’ DRM to counter Recall snooping

date: 2025-05-27, from: OS News

Microsoft&#8217;s Recall feature, which takes screenshots of the contents of your screen every few seconds, saves them, and then runs text and image recognition to extract information from them, has had a rocky start. Even now that it&#8217;s out there and Microsoft deems it ready for everyone to use, it has huge security and privacy gaps, and one of them is that applications that contain sensitive information, such as the Windows Signal application, cannot &#8216;opt out&#8217; of having their contents scraped. Signal was rather unhappy with this massive privacy risk, and decided to do something about it. It&#8217;s called screen security, and is Windows-only because it&#8217;s specifically designed to counter Windows Recall. If you attempt to take a screenshot of Signal Desktop when screen security is enabled, nothing will appear. This limitation can be frustrating, but it might look familiar to you if you’ve ever had the audacity to try and take a screenshot of a movie or TV show on Windows. According to Microsoft’s official developer documentation, setting the correct Digital Rights Management (DRM) flag on the application window will ensure that “content won’t show up in Recall or any other screenshot application.” So that’s exactly what Signal Desktop is now doing on Windows 11 by default. ↫ Joshua Lund on the Signal blog Microsoft cares more about enforcing the rights of massive corporations than it does about respecting the privacy of its users. As such, everything is in place in Windows to ensure neither you nor Recall can take screenshots of, I don&#8217;t know, the Bee Movie, but nothing has been put in place to protect your private and sensitive messages in a service like Signal. This really tells you all you need to know about who Microsoft truly cares about, and it sure as hell isn&#8217;t you, the user. What Signal is doing is absolutely brilliant. By turning Windows&#8217; digital rights management features against Recall to protect the privacy of Signal users, Signal has made it impossible &#8211; or at least very hard &#8211; for Microsoft to address this. Of course, this also means that taking screenshots of the Signal application on Windows for legitimate purposes is more cumbersome now, but since you can temporarily turn screen security off to take a screenshot means it&#8217;s not impossible. I almost want other Windows developers to employ this same trick, just to make Recall less valuable, but that&#8217;s probably not a great idea considering how much it would annoy users just trying to take legitimate screenshots. My uneducated guess is that this is exactly why Microsoft isn&#8217;t providing developers with the kind of fine-grained controls to let Recall know what it can and cannot take screenshots of: Microsoft must know Recall is a feature for shareholders, not for users, and that users will ask developers to opt-out of any Recall snooping if such APIs were officially available. Microsoft wants to make it has hard as possible for applications to opt out of being sucked into the privacy black hole that is Recall, but in doing so, might be pushing developers to use DRM to achieve the same goal. Just delicious. Signal also signed off with a scathing indictment of &#8220;AI&#8221; as a whole. “Take a screenshot every few seconds” legitimately sounds like a suggestion from a low-parameter LLM that was given a prompt like “How do I add an arbitrary AI feature to my operating system as quickly as possible in order to make investors happy?” — but more sophisticated threats are on the horizon. The integration of AI agents with pervasive permissions, questionable security hygiene, and an insatiable hunger for data has the potential to break the blood-brain barrier between applications and operating systems. This poses a significant threat to Signal, and to every privacy-preserving application in general. ↫ Joshua Lund on the Signal blog Heed this warning.
