## Helio Highlights: May 2025

date: 2025-07-08, from: NASA breaking news

The Sun is 93 million miles away, but its presence is felt strongly even at this distance. One of the more beautiful effects of this presence are the auroras which light up the sky in the Northern and Southern polar regions. These displays, also called the Northern and Southern Lights, are caused by interactions between particles of energy from the Sun and the molecules in the atmosphere above Earth’s poles.

## Two weeks of Wayback: first alpha release in a few weeks

date: 2025-07-08, from: OS News

Alpine Linux maintainer Ariadne Conill only started working on Wayback a few weeks ago, but in a blog post today they dive into a few more details about how much progress has already been achieved. To refresh your memory, Wayback allows you to run a legacy X11-based desktop environment on top of Wayland by running a stub Wayland compositor in front of Xwayland, capable of serving as a full X server. This way, the transition to Wayland and the removal of X.org from popular distributions won&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t run X11-based desktop environments anymore. Within just a few weeks, the project has made serious progress. There’s a lot still left to do before we can confidently say that Wayback is ready for distributions to switch to. This work is across the stack: Wayback still needs to expose surfaces that Xwayland can use, Xwayland needs to implement a few new features such as cursor warping and some X extensions inside Xwayland itself need to be properly plumbed (such as Xinerama being able to make use of the Wayland output layout data). Longer term goals aside, we are at most a few weeks away from the first alpha-quality release of Wayback. The main focus of this release is to get to a point where enough is working that users with basic setups and requirements can be reasonably served by Wayback in place of the X.org server, to allow for further testing. It’s already to a point where I am daily driving it. ↫ Ariadne Conill Of course, there&#8217;s still tons of bugs to figure out and missing functionality to implement, but the fact that they&#8217;re just weeks away from a first alpha release is honestly impressive. I really hope Wayback picks up even more and gets adopted by other distributions as well, since it&#8217;s such an elegant and future-proof solution to a very real problem. It&#8217;s important that desktop environments that will not or cannot transition to Wayland remain available to Linux users regardless of their choice of Wayland or X11. When facing the slow sunsetting of a windowing system, some people go off on deranged neofascist conspiracy rants against the woke illuminati, while others sit down and develop real forward-looking solutions. I&#8217;m glad virtually every Linux distribution that matters trusts the latter over the former.

## Windows 11 finally overtakes Windows 10’s user share

date: 2025-07-07, from: OS News

As of today, Stat Counter reports that Windows 11 now has 50.88% of the Windows market, with Windows 10 dropping to 46.2%, giving it a comfortable lead over its predecessor. Windows 11 has been on the market since 2021 but had only amassed less than 10% of the market by 2022. It&#8217;s been a slow but steady climb since then, growing from 18% to 28% in 2023, with similar growth to 36% in 2024. It&#8217;s this year where Windows 11 really started taking off, likely aided by the fact that Microsoft is now pushing&#160;Windows 10&#8217;s end of support&#160;hard. ↫ Zac Bowden at Windows Central Up to 50% of all Windows users, mere months before Windows 10 is no longer supported, and it took them 4 years to get here. Windows users really don&#8217;t like Windows 11, do they?

The developers of Legacy Update, the tool that allows users of older Windows versions to keep downloading updates from Microsoft, recently discovered that users of the tool on Windows 7 were having issues. After doing some debugging they figured out it was DNS it was an expired Microsoft certificate. This certificate was set to expire on 1 July 2025, and when it did, nobody at Microsoft bothered to correct it until a few days later. As you can see from &#38;lt;ExpiryDate&#62;, it definitely stopped working because the expiry date lapsed. As seems to happen too often in our industry, apparently nobody set a reminder to make sure it would be updated in advance of the date. You might notice that it has an &#38;lt;IssuedDate&#62; of 2017-12-01. That’s fairly recent! After digging further, we learned that this already happened once! On the 4th of that month, Bleeping Computer covered an error Windows 7 users were receiving when checking for updates. That error is 80248015 &#8211; pretty familiar, right? Microsoft allowed this file to expire, not on the 1st but rather on the 4th (more specifically, 35 seconds before midnight in US Pacific time, or 8:00 PM UTC), and did not manage to upload a new file until the 6th at 10:02 AM Pacific (6:02 PM UTC). This left Microsoft Update broken for 3 days. ↫ Adam Demasi Microsoft moved the expiry date up to 2033, thereby fixing the problem. Legacy Update&#8217;s developer Adam Demasi expected that once 2033 comes around, Legacy Update will probably have to add Widnows 7 to its proxy server that it&#8217;s already using for older versions, as improvements in TLS and ciphers will probably lock Windows 7 out of Windows Update definitively. But hey, 2033 is decades away. Right?

## WinUAE 6.0.0 released

date: 2025-07-07, from: OS News

WinUAE has released version 6.0.0 of the Windows version of the UAE Amiga emulator, packing a truly terrifying number of changes, improvements, and fixes. Major update to custom chipset emulation. Internally almost everything in main chipset emulation has been rewritten. Fastest possible/JIT mode chipset timing/sync had major changes which can cause side-effects. Bugs are very possible, especially in very rarely used features. ↫ WinUAE website Going through the changelog is dizzying, ranging from an almost complete rewrite of the main chipset emulation for internal cycle accuracy, to running the emulation of the Denise/Lisa chips in a separate thread for better performance, to a ton of fixes and smaller updates.

## MacOS’ icons keep getting worse every time Apple touches them

date: 2025-07-06, from: OS News

With macOS 26, Apple has announced a dramatically new look to their UI: Liquid Glass. Solid material icon elements give way to softer, shinier, glassier icons. The rounded rectangle became slightly more rounded, and Apple eliminated the ability for icon elements to extend beyond the icon rectangle (as seen in the current icons for GarageBand, Photo Booth, Dictionary, etc.). With this release being one of the most dramatic visual overhauls of macOS&#8217;s design, I wanted to begin a collection chronicling the evolution of the system icons over the years. I&#8217;ve been rolling these out on social media over the past week and will continue to add to and update this collection slowly over the summer. Enjoy! ↫ BasicAppleGuy Every single one of these icons is getting progressively worse with almost every design change. They go from beautifully crafted, easily readable and supremely distinguishable icons to generic, repetitive blobs of colour, void of any personality, artistry, or usability considerations. Also, Apple&#8217;s new icon design language makes the icons look fuzzy, like they&#8217;re not being rendered properly. It&#8217;s very unnerving. The one exception is probably the generic folder icon, which looks fine in all of its incarnations. Then there&#8217;s the classic Platinum, pixelated version from Mac OS 9 and earlier, which, together with icons from Windows and BeOS from the same time period, are a whole different style that I don&#8217;t think most people would accept anymore these days, but that I absolutely adore. Mostly I&#8217;m just sad that the craft of making exquisite icons for operating systems is dying, replaced by what almost look like &#8220;AI&#8221; generated blobs of indeterminate meaning, that rely more on preexisting knowledge of the operating system and its applications in question than on being recognisable and decipherable by anyone. I truly hope Windows and the various open source desktops don&#8217;t follow in Apple&#8217;s footsteps here.

## Tone-deaf Xbox executive urges laid off employees to talk to Copilot for emotional support

date: 2025-07-06, from: OS News

A couple of days ago, Microsoft announced 9,000 layoffs across its global workforce, impacting its engineering, Xbox, sales, and management teams. This move also affected various initiatives, resulting in the cancellation of at least three Xbox games, job cuts across various studios, and even the shuttering of one game studio, The Initiative. In the wake of this dark day in the the tech industry, a tone-deaf Microsoft executive urged laid off workers to turn to AI tools for emotional support. ↫ Usama Jawad at Neowin These corporations are raking in massive amounts of profit, they&#8217;re doing better than ever, the cup of money runneth over, and yet, they keep laying off thousands and thousands of people almost every few months. The incentives in modern-day capitalism clearly aren&#8217;t working out for the vast majority of people, and then to give that final kick when you&#8217;re already down, some asshat manager tells you to &#8220;talk to&#8221; sparkly autocomplete for emotional support. Fuck this guy.
