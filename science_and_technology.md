## Garmin Pay: yes, you can do NFC tap-to-pay in stores without big tech

date: 2025-04-28, from: OS News

Late last year, I went on a long journey to rid myself of as much of my remaining ties to the big technology giants as I could. This journey is still ongoing, with only a few thin ties remaining, but there&#8217;s one big one I can scratch off the list: mobile in-store payments with NFC tap-to-pay. I used Google Pay and a WearOS smartwatch for this, but neither of those work on de-Googled Android &#8211; I opted for GrapheneOS &#8211; and it seemed like I was just going to have to accept the loss of this functionality. That is, until I stumbled upon a few forum posts here and there suggesting a solution: Garmin, maker of fitness trackers and smartwatches with a strong focus on sports, health, and the outdoor lifestyle, has its own mobile NFC tap-to-pay service that supposedly worked just fine on any Android device, de-Googled or not. In fact, people claimed you could even remove the companion Garmin application from your phone entirely after setting up the payment functionality, and it would still keep working. This seemed like something I should look into, because the lack of NFC tap-to-pay is a recurring concern for many people intending to switch to de-Googled Android. So, late last year, many of you chipped in, allowing me to buy a Garmin smartwatch to try this functionality out, for which I&#8217;m incredibly grateful, of course. Here&#8217;s how all of this works, and if it&#8217;s a good alternative for Google Pay. The Garmin Instinct 2S Solar First, let&#8217;s dive into which watch I chose to buy. Garmin has a wide variety of fitness trackers and smartwatches in its line-up, from basic trackers, to Apple Watch/WearOS-like devices, to outdoor-focused rugged devices. I opted for one of the outdoor-focused rugged devices, because not only would it give me the Garmin Pay functionality, but also a few other advantages and unique features I figured OSNews readers would be interested in: a simple black-and-white transflective memory-in-pixel display, a battery life measured in weeks (!), a solar panel built into the display glass, and a case constructed out of lightweight but durable plastics instead of heavy, scratch-prone metal. The specific model I opted for was the Instinct 2S Solar in Mist Grey. I wasn&#8217;t intending for this to become a review of the watch as a whole, but I figured I might as well share some notes about my experiences with this particular watch model. It&#8217;s important to note though that Garmin offers a wide variety of smartwatches, from models that look and feel mostly like an Apple Watch or wearOS device, to mechanical models with &#8216;invisible&#8217; OLED displays on the dial, to ruggedised, button-only watches for hardcore outdoor people. If you&#8217;re interested in a Garmin device, there&#8217;s most likely a type that fits your wishes. The Instinct 2S is definitely not the most beautiful or attractive watch I&#8217;ve ever had on my wrist. It has that &#8220;rugged&#8221; look some people are really into, but for me, I definitely had to get used to it. I do really like the colour combination I opted for, though, as it complements the black/white transflective memory-in-pixel display really well. I&#8217;ve grown to&#8230; Appreciate the look over time. The case and bezel of the watch are made out of what Garmin calls &#8220;fiber-reinforced polymer&#8221;, which is probably just a form of fiber-reinforced plastic. Regardless of the buzzwords, it feels nice and sturdy, with a great texture, and not at all plasticy or cheap. Using a material like this over the metals the Apple Watch and most WearOS devices are made of has several advantages; first, it makes the device much lighter and thus more pleasant to wear, and it&#8217;s a lot sturdier and resilient than metals. I&#8217;ve banged this watch into door sills and countertops a few times now, and there&#8217;s not a scratch, dent, or discoloration on it &#8211; a far cry from the various metal Apple Watches and WearOS devices I own, which accumulated dings and scratches within weeks of buying them. The case material is one of the many ways in which this watch chooses function over form. Sure, metals might feel premium, but a high-quality plastic is cheaper to make, lasts longer, is more resilient, and also happens to be lighter &#8211; it&#8217;s simply the objectively better choice for something you wear on wrist every day, exposed to the elements. I understand why people want their smartwatch to be made out of metal, but much like how the orange-red plastic of the Nexus 5 is still the best smartphone material I&#8217;ve ever experienced (the white and black models uses inferior plastics), this Garmin tops all of the metal watches I own. The strap is made of silicone, and has an absurd amount of tightly-spaced adjustment holes, which makes it very easy to adjust to changing circumstances, like a bit of extra slack for when you&#8217;re working out. It also has a nice touch in that the second loop has a little peg that slots into an adjustment hole, keeping it in place. Ingenious. Other than that, it&#8217;s just a silicone band with the clasp made out of the same sturdy, pleasant &#8220;fiber-reinforced polymer&#8221; as the case. The lens over the display is made out of something Garmin calls &#8220;Power Glass™&#8221;, and I have no idea what that means. It just feels like a watch lens to me &#8211; solid, glassy, and&#8230; I don&#8217;t know, round? The unique aspect of the display glass is, of course, the built-in solar panel. It&#8217;s hard for me to tell what kind of impact &#8211; if any &#8211; the solar panel has on the battery life of the device. What quite obviously does not help is that I live in the Arctic where sun hours come at a bit of a premium, so it&#8217;s been impossible for me to stand outside and hold out my arm for a while to see if it had an effect on the charge level. There&#8217;s a software

## OpenBSD 7.7 released

date: 2025-04-27, from: OS News

Another six months have passed, so it&#8217;s time for a new OpenBSD release: OpenBSD 7.7 to be exact. Browsing through the long, detailed list of changes, a few important bits jump out. First, OpenBSD 7.7 adds support for Ryzen AI 300 (Strix Point, Strix Halo, Krackan Point), Radeon RX 9070 (Navi 48), and Intel&#8217;s Arrow Lake, adding support for the latest x86 processors to OpenBSD. There seems to be quite a few entries in the list related to power management, from work on hibernation and suspend, to more fine-grained control over performance profiles when on battery or plugged in. There&#8217;s also the usual long list of driver improvements, new drivers, and tons and tons of other fixes and changes. OpenBSD 7.7 also ships with the latest GNOME and KDE releases, and contains fixes and improvements for a whole slew of obscure and outdated architectures.

## Crucial Wii homebrew library contains code stolen from Nintendo, RTEMS

date: 2025-04-27, from: OS News

The Wii homebrew community has been dealt a pretty serious blow, as developers of The Homebrew Channel for the Wii have discovered that not only does an important library most Wii homebrew software rely on use code stolen straight from Nintendo, that same library also uses code taken from an open source real-time operating system without giving proper attribution. Most Wii homebrew software is built atop a library called libogc. This library apparently contains code stolen from Nintendo&#8217;s SDK as well as from games using this SDK, decompiled and cleaned. This has been known for a while, but it was believed that large, important parts of libogc were at least original, but that, too, turns out to be untrue. Recently it has been discovered that libogc&#8217;s threading/OS implementation has been stolen from RTEMS, an open source real-time operating system. The developers of libogc have indicated that they do not care, intend to do nothing about it, and deleted any issues reporting the stolen code. What&#8217;s wild about the code stolen from RTEMS is that it&#8217;s an open source operating system with a nice, permissive license; there was no need to steal the code at all, and all it would take to address it is proper attribution. As such, the fail0verflow group, which develops The Homebrew Channel for the Wii, has ceased all development on The Homebrew Channel, and archived the code repository. The Wii homebrew community was all built on top of a pile of lies and copyright infringement, and it&#8217;s all thanks to shagkur (who did the stealing) and the rest of the team (who enabled it and did nothing when it was discovered). Together, the developers deceived everyone into believing their work was original. Please demand that the leaders and major contributors to console or other proprietary device SDKs and toolkits that you use and work with do things legally, and do not tolerate this kind of behavior. ↫ The Homebrew Channel GitHub page Considering Nintendo is on a crusade to shutdown emulators, stuff like this is really not helping anyone trying to argue that consoles should be open devices, that emulators play an important role in preservation, and that people have a right to play the games they own on a device other than the console it&#8217;s intended for. I&#8217;m sure this isn&#8217;t the last we&#8217;ll hear about this development.

## 9front “CLAUSE 15 COMMON ELEMENTS OF MAUS AND STAR TYPE” released

date: 2025-04-27, from: OS News

Few things in life make me happier than a new 9front release. This new release, 9front “CLAUSE 15 COMMON ELEMENTS OF MAUS AND STAR TYPE”, comes with a variety of fixes and new features, such as temperature sensor support for Ryzen processors, a new Intel i225 2.5 GbE driver, a number of low-level kernel improvements, and so, so many more small fixes and changes. If you use 9front, you already know all of this, and you&#8217;re too cool to read OSNews anyway. If you&#8217;re new to 9front and want to join the cool people club, you can download images for PC, Raspberry Pi, MNT Reform, and QEMU.

## RetrOS-32: a 32bit hobby operating system with graphics, multitasking, and more

date: 2025-04-27, from: OS News

RetrOS-32 is a 32bit operating system written from scratch, with graphics, multitasking and networking capabilities. The kernel is written in C and assembly, while the userspace applications are written in C++, using Make for compilation, all licensed under the MIT license. It runs on Qemu, of course, but a variety of real hardware is also supported, which is pretty cool and relatively unique for a small hobby project like this. The UI is delightfully retro &#8211; as the name obviously implies &#8211; and it comes with a set of basic applications, as well as games like Wolfenstein 3D.
