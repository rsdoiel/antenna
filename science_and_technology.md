## Reviving a dead audio format: the return of ZZM

date: 2025-01-28, from: OS News

Long-time readers will know that my first video game love was the text-mode video game slash creation studio ZZT. One feature of this game is the ability to play simple music through the PC speaker, and back in the day, I remember that the format “ZZM” existed, so you could enjoy the square wave tunes outside of the games. But imagine my surprise in 2025 to find that, while the Museum of ZZT does have a ZZM Audio section, it recommends that nobody use the format anymore; because nobody’s made a player that doesn’t require MS-DOS. Let’s fix that by making a player with way higher system requirements, using everyone’s favorite coding environment: Javascript. ↫ Nicole Branagan ZZM&#8217;s history and Branagan&#8217;s journey to make this work without having to rely on DOS took a lot more work than I expected, and is quite interesting, too. Very niche, for sure, but that&#8217;s kind of what we&#8217;re here for.

## The invalid 68030 instruction that accidentally allowed the Mac Classic II to successfully boot up

date: 2025-01-28, from: OS News

A bug in the ROM for the Macintosh II was recently discovered that causes a crash when booting in 32-bit mode. Doug Brown discovered and documented the bug while playing with the MAME debugger. Why did it never show up before? It seems a quirk in Motorola&#8217;s 68030 CPU inadvertently fixes it when executing an illegal instruction that shouldn&#8217;t have been executed in the first place. What follows is his process for investigating the room on emulated hardware, and then testing it on actual hardware.

## PebbleOS becomes open source, new Pebble device announced

date: 2025-01-27, from: OS News

Eric Migicovsky, founder of Pebble, the original smartwatch maker, made a major announcement today together with Google. Pebble was originally bought by Fitbit and in turn Fitbit was then bought by Google, but Migicovsky always wanted to to go back to his original idea and create a brand new smartwatch. PebbleOS took dozens of engineers working over 4 years to build, alongside our fantastic product and QA teams. Reproducing that for new hardware would take a long time. Instead, we took a more direct route &#8211; I asked friends at Google (which bought Fitbit, which had bought Pebble’s IP) if they could open source PebbleOS. They said yes! Over the last year, a team inside Google (including some amazing ex-Pebblers turned Googlers) has been working on this. And today is the day &#8211; the source code for PebbleOS is now available at github.com/google/pebble (see their blog post). ↫ Eric Migicovsky Of course, this is amazing news for the still-thriving community of Pebble users who have kept the platform and their devices going through sheer force of will, but it also means Pebble is going to making a comeback in a more official capacity: alongside the announcement of PebbleOS becoming open source, there&#8217;s also the unveiling of rePebble, a brand new Pebble watch that retains all of the popular features and specifications of the original devices. It&#8217;ll run the open source PebbleOS, of course, and will be compatible with the existing ecosystem of applications. I&#8217;ve never had a Pebble, but there&#8217;s no denying the company hit on something valuable, and I know people who still rock their original Pebble devices to this day. The excitement about this announcement is palpable, and I&#8217;m pleasantly surprised Google cared enough to work on making an open source PebbleOS a reality (I know of quite a few other companies sitting on deeply loved code and IP rotting away in obscurity). I can&#8217;t wait to see what the new device will look like!

## Chinese researchers just built an open-source rival to ChatGPT in 2 months, and Silicon Valley is freaked out

date: 2025-01-27, from: OS News

Speaking of &#8220;AI&#8221;, the Chinese company DeepSeek has lobbed a grenade dead-centre into the middle of the &#8220;AI&#8221; bubble, and it&#8217;s been incredibly entertaining to watch. DeepSeek has released several new &#8220;AI&#8221; models, which seem to rival or even surpass OpenAI&#8217;s latest ChatGPT models &#8211; but with a massive twist: DeepSeek, being Chinese, can&#8217;t use NVIDIA&#8217;s latest GPUs, and as such, was forced to work within very tight constraints. They&#8217;ve managed to surpass ChatGPT&#8217;s best models with a fraction of the GPU horsepower, and thus a fraction of the cost, and a fraction of the energy requirements. But unlike ChatGPT&#8217;s o1, DeepSeek is an &#8220;open-weight&#8221; model that (although its training data remains proprietary) enables users to peer inside and modify its algorithm. Just as important is its reduced price for users — 27 times less than o1. Besides its performance, the hype around DeepSeek comes from its cost efficiency; the model&#8217;s shoestring budget is minuscule compared with the tens of millions to hundreds of millions that rival companies spent to train its competitors. ↫ Ben Turner at LiveScience The fallout has been disastrous for NVIDIA, in particular. The company&#8217;s stock price tumbled 17% today, and more entertaining yet, the various massive investments of hundreds of billions of dollars into western &#8220;AI&#8221; seem like a huge waste of money. The DeepSeek models are also nominally open source, and are clearly showing that most likely, there simply isn&#8217;t a huge &#8220;AI&#8221; market worth hundreds of billions of dollars dollars at all. On top of that, the US is clearly not ahead in &#8220;AI&#8221; at all, as was the common wisdom pretty much until yesterday. Of course, DeepSeek is Chinese, and that means censorship &#8211; the real kind &#8211; is a thing. Asking the latest DeepSeek model about the massacre at Tiananmen Square returns nothing, suggesting the user ask about other topics instead. I&#8217;m sure over the coming weeks more and more or these kinds of censorship will be discovered, but hopefully its open source nature will allow the models to be adapted and changed to remove such censorship. Do note that all of these &#8220;AI&#8221; models are all deeply biased because they&#8217;re trained on content that is itself deeply biased, thereby perpetuating and amplifying damaging stereotypes and inaccuracies, especially since people have a tendency to assume computers can&#8217;t be biased. Whatever may happen, at least OpenAI losing its job to &#8220;AI&#8221; is hilarious.

## AI bots paralyze Linux news site and others

date: 2025-01-27, from: OS News

Apparently, since the beginning of the year, AI bots have been ensuring that websites can only respond to regular inquiries with a delay. The founder of Linux Weekly News (LWN-net), Jonathan Corbet, reports that the news site is therefore often slow to respond. The AI scraper bots cause a DDoS, a distributed denial-of-service attack. At times, the AI bots would clog the lines with hundreds of IP addresses simultaneously as soon as they decided to access the site&#8217;s content. Corbet explains on Mastodon that only a small proportion of the traffic currently serves real human readers. ↫ Dirk Knop at Heise.de I&#8217;m sure someone will tell me we just have to accept that a large percentage of our bandwidth is going to overpriced bullshit generators, and that we should just suck it up and pay for Sam Altman&#8217;s new house. I hope these same people realise &#8220;AI&#8221; is destroying the last vestiges of the internet that haven&#8217;t fallen victim to all the other techbro fads so far, and that sooner rather than later there won&#8217;t be anything left to browse to. The coming few years are going to be fun.
