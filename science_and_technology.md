## ‘Next-Level’ Chaos Traces the True Limit of Predictability

date: 2025-03-07, from: Quanta Magazine

In math and computer science, researchers have long understood that some questions are fundamentally unanswerable. Now physicists are exploring how even ordinary physical systems put hard limits on what we can predict, even in principle.             <p>The post <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/next-level-chaos-traces-the-true-limit-of-predictability-20250307/" target="_blank">‘Next-Level’ Chaos Traces the True Limit of Predictability</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org" target="_blank">Quanta Magazine</a></p>

## Made O’Meter helps you easily and quickly avoid American products

date: 2025-03-06, from: OS News

With the United States having started an incredibly dumb and destructive trade war with Canada, Mexico, and most likely soon the European Union, there&#8217;s quite a few people who want to avoid American products. With how interconnected the global production chain and corporate ownership structures are, it&#8217;s often difficult to determine where products actually come from. Luckily, technology can help. There&#8217;s online directories like Buy European Made, which lists European companies in all kinds of markets, or European Alternatives, which focuses on listing European alternatives to online services. As nice as these are, they are quite manual, and require people to actively search around, which is kind of a hassle when you&#8217;re making a quick grocery store run. What if we could use image recognition to just take a photo of a product&#8217;s box, and have our phone tell us where a product&#8217;s made? That&#8217;s exactly what Made O&#8217;Meter does: take a photo of a product, wait for a few seconds, and it&#8217;ll tell you exactly where it&#8217;s made. It&#8217;s made in Denmark, with the goal to &#8220;support Europe, Canada &#38; friends&#8221;. I&#8217;ve been trying it out on various products around the house, from groceries like cereals and cookies, to tech products and clothing we just bought that still had the tags on them. Every result turned out to be 100% accurate, and it takes only a few seconds to analyse each photo. It also doesn&#8217;t seem to be too fussy with the quality of the photos themselves &#8211; it doesn&#8217;t care about hands and fingers in the frame, or weirdly-shaped boxes that don&#8217;t fit nicely in a view finder. It&#8217;s a website, not an app &#8211; very platform-agnostic, which is great &#8211; and I was using it in Firefox for Android without issue. If you want to avoid American products, Made O&#8217;Meter is a great tool to have with you the next time you order something or run to the store.

## Comparing Fuchsia components and Linux containers

date: 2025-03-06, from: OS News

Fuchsia is a new (non-Linux) operating system from Google, and one of the key pieces of Fuchsia&#8217;s design is the component framework. Components on Fuchsia have many similarities with some of the container solutions on Linux (such as Docker): they both fetch content addressed blobs from the network, assemble those blobs into an isolated filesystem structure that holds all the dependencies necessary to run some piece of software, and launch namespaced processes with that created directory as its root. The most interesting details are where these two projects diverge. Both have different use cases and requirements, which leads to different strengths between the systems. This talk will largely be focusing on where and why these two similar technologies diverge. ↫ Claire Gonyeo A very interesting talk by Claire Gonyeo, a software engineer at Google working on Fuchsia.

## Google, DuckDuckGo massively expand “AI” search results

date: 2025-03-06, from: OS News

Clearly, online search isn&#8217;t bad enough yet, so Google is intensifying its efforts to continue speedrunning the downfall of Google Search. They&#8217;ve announced they&#8217;re going to show even more &#8220;AI&#8221;-generated answers in Search results, to more people. Today, we’re sharing that we’ve launched Gemini 2.0 for AI Overviews in the U.S. to help with harder questions, starting with coding, advanced math and multimodal queries, with more on the way. With Gemini 2.0’s advanced capabilities, we provide faster and higher quality responses and show AI Overviews more often for these types of queries. Plus, we’re rolling out to more people: teens can now use AI Overviews, and you’ll no longer need to sign in to get access. ↫ Robby Stein On top of this, Google is also testing a new search mode where &#8220;AI&#8221; takes over the entire search experience. Instead of seeing the usual list of links, the entire page of &#8220;results&#8221; will be generated by &#8220;AI&#8221;. This feature, called &#8220;AI Mode&#8221; is opt-in for now. You can opt-in in Labs, but you do need to be a paying Google One AI Premium subscriber. I guess it&#8217;s only a matter of time before this &#8220;AI Mode&#8221; will be the default on Google Search, because it allows Google to keep its users on Google.com, and this makes it easier to show them ads and block out competitors. We all know where this is going. But, I hear you say, I use DuckDuckGo! I don&#8217;t have to deal with any of this! Well, I&#8217;ve got some bad news for you, because DuckDuckGo, too, is greatly expanding its use of &#8220;AI&#8221; in search. DDG will provide free, anonymous access to various &#8220;AI&#8221; chatbots, deliver more &#8220;AI&#8221;-generated search results based on more sources (but still English-only), and more &#8211; all without needing to have an account. A few of these features were already available in beta, and are now becoming generally available. Props to DuckDuckGo for providing a ton of options to turn all of this stuff off, though. They give users quite a bit of control over how often these &#8220;AI&#8221;-generated search results appear, and you can even turn them off completely. All the &#8220;AI&#8221; chatbot stuff is delegated to a separate website, and any link to it from the normal search results can be disabled, too. It&#8217;s entirely possible to have DuckDuckGo just show a list of regular search results, exactly as it should be. Let&#8217;s hope DDG can keep these values going, because if they, too, start pushing this &#8220;AI&#8221; nonsense without options to turn it off, I honestly have no idea where else to go.

## NetBSD on a JavaStation

date: 2025-03-06, from: OS News

Back when Java was still a new programming language, Sun had the idea of building a computer specifically designed for Java, unique processor running byte-code as its native machine code and all. This whole endeavour proved to be more complicated than Sun had hoped, and as such, they eventually abandoned the idea of a Java processor in favour of plain SPARC. When the JavaStation shipped, it was a regular SPARC workstation without a hard drive, running something called JavaOS from flash memory. Since JavaOS is, of course, long gone, what can you do with JavaStation today? Well, you apparently can run NetBSD on it, but it&#8217;s quite an ordeal. The JavaStation needs to boot from the network using a combination of RARP, NFS, and more, and surprisingly, this entire setup, including the computer acting as the &#8216;server&#8217; for the JavaStation, is well-documented and supported by NetBSD. Once you&#8217;ve gone through all the steps, you&#8217;ll end up with a JavaStation running the latest release of NetBSD, which is pretty cool. Obviously there is still a lot to do; as you can see postfix isn’t happy, and the swapfile security needs tightening up for a start. But we do now have a functional NetBSD system running on a vintage network computer! ↫ Old Fart&#8217;s Almanac NetBSD&#8217;s continued support for the most arcane of hardware will never cease to amaze me.

## Zen and the art of microcode hacking

date: 2025-03-05, from: OS News

Now that we have examined the vulnerability that enables arbitrary microcode patches to be installed on all (un-patched) Zen 1 through Zen 4 CPUs, let&#8217;s discuss how you can use and expand our tools to author your own patches. We have been working on developing a collection of tools combined into a single project we’re calling zentool. The long-term goal is to provide a suite of capabilities similar to binutils, but targeting AMD microcode instead of CPU machine code. You can find the project source code here along with documentation on how to use the tools. ↫ Google&#8217;s Bug Hunters website I just read a whole bunch of words, but I barely understand what&#8217;s going on. The general, very simplified gist is that the researchers discovered a way for an attacker with local administrator privileges to load arbitrary microcode onto AMD Zen 1-4 processors.

## Microsoft Publisher will no longer be supported after October 2026

date: 2025-03-05, from: OS News

In October 2026, Microsoft Publisher will reach its end of life. After that time, it will no longer be included in Microsoft 365 and existing on-premises suites will no longer be supported. Microsoft 365 subscribers will no longer be able to open or edit Publisher files in Publisher. Until then, support for Publisher will continue and users can expect the same experience as today. ↫ Microsoft&#8217;s Support website Microsoft Publisher is an application with a long history, and it&#8217;s been part of Microsoft Office for almost 35 years. The initial 1.0 version was released all the way back in 1991, and it&#8217;s tried to compete with tools like InDesign and QuarkXPress in the desktop publishing market, but it never gained much of a share. Microsoft advises users of Publisher to use a combination of Word, PowerPoint, or Designer instead, which, of course, are all Microsoft products too. Due to Microsoft&#8217;s stupidly complex naming schemes and branding changes over the years, you might assume that the quoted paragraph means Publisher will just stop working for everyone, but that&#8217;s not the case. People who have the regular, non-subscription version of Publisher, probably as part of Microsoft Office, will of course be able to keep using it perpetually, just without support. If you use Office through Microsoft 365, however, the application will just&#8230; Stop working. Welcome to the future, I guess. I&#8217;m curious, though &#8211; do any of you use Microsoft Publisher, at home or at your work? I assumed the entire desktop publishing market was locked up by things like InDesign and QuarkXPress, and I had almost forgotten Publisher was still a thing in the first place.

## Why fastDOOM is fast

date: 2025-03-04, from: OS News

How much faster is fastDOOM than regular Doom on a decked-out 486 from 1993? 30% faster without cutting any features! On a demanding map like doom2&#8217;s demo1, the gain is even higher, from 16.8 fps to 24.9 fps. That is 48% faster! I did not suspect that DOOM had left that much on the table. Obviously shipping within one year left little time to optimize. I had to understand how this magic trick happened. ↫ Fabien Sanglard What follows is an incredibly detailed exploration of why, exactly, fastDOOM is so much faster, by building and benchmarking every version, and even going git commit by git commit to really understand how fastDOOM&#8217;s developer, Victor &#8220;Viti95&#8221; Nieto, achieved these impressive results.

## Redox continues adding dynamic linking support

date: 2025-03-04, from: OS News

These months are coming and going way too fast, for a whole variety of reasons, so we&#8217;ve got another month of improvements for Redox, the operating system written in Rust. I February, January&#8217;s work on dynamic linking continued, adding support for it to the recipes for Cargo, LLVM, Rust, libssh2, OpenSSL, zlib, COSMIC Terminal, NetSurf, libpng, bzip2, DevilutionX, and LuaJIT, as well as to the project&#8217;s Rust and OpenSSL forks. Relibc also saw its usual slew of improvements, as did the build system and documentation. The Intel HD Audio driver initialization has been fixed, and PS/2 touchpad support has been fixed as well &#8211; you&#8217;d be surprised to find out how many laptops use PS/2 internally, so this is an important function to maintain. And as always, there&#8217;s a whole slew of smaller changes and fixes, too.

## Google multibillionaire Brin demands employees work 60 hours a week on autocomplete tools

date: 2025-03-04, from: OS News

Over the past few years, the tech industry has gone from cushy landing pad for STEM grads to a cesspit of corporate greed, where grueling hours are commonplace, and layoffs could strike at any moment. Unfortunately for employees of Alphabet, the parent company of Google, the squeeze is just getting started. ↫ Joe Wilkins at Futurism Sergey Brin, one of the original co-founders of Google who seems to spend most of his time not working at Google, has sent out a company-wide memo demanding everyone working at Google puts in at least 60 hours a week, in the office, to work on &#8220;AI&#8221; that will eventually replace the very employees he&#8217;s demanding work 60 hours a week in the office. Mind you, this is the same Google that has just gone through several rounds of layoffs and made $26.3 billion in profit in a single quarter. The goal, according to Brin, is for Google to be the first to create an &#8220;artificial general intelligence&#8221;, you know, that thing we used to call just &#8220;AI&#8221; until the Silicon Valley scammers got a hold of the term. There&#8217;s no indication anyone is even remotely close to anything even remotely related to &#8220;AGI&#8221;, and it&#8217;s highly unlikely the glorified autocomplete they are peddling today are anything more than a very expensive dead end to nowhere, but that&#8217;s not stopping him from working his employees to the bone. At this point in time I feel like the big tech companies are racing towards a cliff, blinded by huge piles of investment money, deafened by each other&#8217;s hyperbolic claims and promises, while clueless politicians cheer them on. All of this is going to come crashing down in a spectacular fashion, and of course, the billionaires at the top won&#8217;t be the one suffering the consequences. As is tradition.

## C++ creator calls for help to defend programming language from ‘serious attacks’

date: 2025-03-03, from: OS News

Bjarne Stroustrup, creator of C++, has issued a call for the C++ community to defend the programming language, which has been shunned by cybersecurity agencies and technical experts in recent years for its memory safety shortcomings. C and C++ are built around manual memory management, which can result in memory safety errors, such as out of bounds reads and writes, though both languages can be written and combined with tools and libraries to help minimize that risk. These sorts of bugs, when they do crop up, represent the majority of vulnerabilities in large codebases. ↫ Thomas Claburn at The Register I mean, it makes sense to me that those responsible for new code to use programming languages that more or less remove the most common class of vulnerabilities. With memory-safe languages like Rust having been around for quite a while now, it&#8217;s almost wilful negligence to write new code where security is a priority in anything but such memory-safe languages. Of course, this doesn&#8217;t mean you delete any and all existing code &#8211; it just means you really need to start writing any new code in safer languages. After all, research shows that even when you only write new code in memory-safe languages, the reduction in vulnerabilities is massive. This reminds me a lot of those old videos of people responding to then-new laws mandating the use of seat belts in cars. A lot of people didn&#8217;t want to put them on, saying things to the tune of &#8220;I don&#8217;t need one because I&#8217;m a good driver&#8221;. Even if you are a good driver &#8211; which statistically you aren&#8217;t &#8211; everyone else on the road isn&#8217;t. When we see those old videos now, they feel quaint, archaic, and dumb &#8211; of course you wear a seat belt, you&#8217;d be an irresponsible idiot not to! &#8211; but only a few decades ago, those arguments made perfect sense to people. It won&#8217;t be long before the same will apply to people doggedly refusing to use memory-safe languages or libraries/extensions that introduce such safety to existing languages, and Bjarne Stroustrup seems to understand that. Are you really smarter than Bjarne Stroustrup?

## Microsoft is not ending Windows 11 support for Intel’s 8th, 9th, and 10th Gen processors

date: 2025-03-02, from: OS News

About two weeks ago, there was a bit of confusion about the system requirements for Windows 11 24H2, because Intel&#8217;s 8th Gen, 9th Gen, and 10th Gen processors had disappeared from the list of supported hardware. This seemed rather drastic, even by Windows 11 standards. I skipped posting about it on OSNews because I kind of assumed it must&#8217;ve been an error instead of actual policy, and it turns out that&#8217;s indeed the case. A page update made on February 13, 2025 did not reflect accurate offerings. It has since been updated, including the addition of Intel processor models 8th, 9th, and 10th generation Intel CPUs, and the reclassification for select Intel processor models to support Windows 11. ↫ Windows 11 version 24H2 supported Intel processors Good news for people still stuck on the Windows 11 train.
