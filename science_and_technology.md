## KDE Plasma 6.3 brings drawing tablet improvements

date: 2025-02-11, from: OS News

Speaking of KDE, Plasma 6.3 has been released. It brings with it a ton of improvements aimed at digital artists, such as much improved management and configuration of drawing tablets. You can now map an area of the tablet&#8217;s surface to a part of the screen, change the functions of stylus buttons, customise the pressure curve and range of a stylus, and much more. The entire settings panel for drawing tablets has also been redesigned to make it easier to find what you&#8217;re looking for. Plasma 6.3 also completely overhauls KWin&#8217;s fraction scaling. Fractional scaling in KWin will not try to snap everything to your display&#8217;s pixel grid, to reduce blurriness and make everything look sharper. KWin&#8217;s zoom effect also makes use of these improvements, making for a pixel-perfect zoom feature with a pixel grid overlay, which is great for artists and designers. This will be a very welcome improvement for people using e.g. 125% or 150% scaling on their displays. Hardware monitoring is much improved too, with System Monitor showing more information while using fewer resources, and KDE users on FreeBSD can now see GPU statistics too. There&#8217;s also a ton of small additions that are still quite welcome, like opening the menu editor instead of a properties dialog when clicking on Edit Application in a launcher menu&#8217;s context menu, the ability to clone panels, an option to turn of symbolic icons in Kickoff, a &#8220;Show Target&#8221; option in the context menu of symbolic links, and a lot more. KDE Plasma 6.3 will find its way to your distribution of choice soon enough.

## Moving KDE’s styling into the future

date: 2025-02-11, from: OS News

One of the major issues with KDE&#8217;s styling system is the fact that over the year, it has accumulated four ways of styling applications &#8211; which makes themeing and changing aspects of the default theme far more cumbersome than it should be. In fact, with the current version of KDE, it&#8217;s effectively impossible to consistently theme the entire KDE desktop, as several parts of it, like Kirigami applications, only inherit parts of the theme you&#8217;re applying. It&#8217;s a bit of a mess, and KDE is well aware of this. This problem is not new; we already identified it several years ago. Unfortunately, it also is not easy to solve. Some of the reasons it got to this state are simply inertia. Some things like Plasma&#8217;s SVG styling were developed as a way to improve styling in an era where a lot of the technologies we currently use did not exist yet. The solutions developed in those days have now existed for a pretty long time so we cannot suddenly drop them. Other reasons are more technical in nature, such as completely different rendering stacks. ↫ Arjen Hiemstra These different rendering stacks form the core of the problem, as they can&#8217;t use the same rendering code for everything. Currently, KDE tries to address the problem through a compatibility layer to tie everything together, but it&#8217;s not perfect, it has to be maintained, and it means they&#8217;re not utilising their rendering stacks to their fullest potential. The solution KDE is working on is called Union. However, there is another option, which is to take a step back and realise that we actually may not even want to share the rendering code, given that they are quite different. Instead, we need a description of what the element should look like, and then we can have specific rendering code that implements how to render that in the best way for a certain technology stack. ↫ Arjen Hiemstra Basically, an input layer will interpret file formats with style descrpitions, while an intermediate layer consists of a library that converts that interpretation into a more abstract description of what needs to be rendered. The final output layer then uses the data from the intermediate layer to tell the rendering stacks what to do. By standardising on the input format, say CSS, it&#8217;ll be much easier to impement themes or make changes. This effort is still far from done, but they&#8217;re making good progress. It ties into the Plasma Next initiative, which is, as the name implies, an effort to make changes to Plasma&#8217;s default look and feel.

## Oasis: a small, statically-linked Linux system

date: 2025-02-10, from: OS News

You might think the world of Linux distributions is a rather boring, settled affair, but there&#8217;s actually a ton of interesting experimentation going on in the Linux world. From things like NixOS with its unique packaging framework, to the various immutable distributions out there like the Fedora Atomic editions, there&#8217;s enough uniqueness to go around to find a lid for every pot. Oasis Linux surely falls into this category. One of its main unique characteristics is that it&#8217;s entirely statically linked. All software in the base system is linked statically, including the display server (velox) and web browser (netsurf). Compared to dynamic linking, this is a simpler mechanism which eliminates problems with upgrading libraries, and results in completely self-contained binaries that can easily be copied to other systems. ↫ Oasis GitHub page That&#8217;s not all it has to offer, though. It also offers fast and 100% reproducible builds, it&#8217;s mostly ISO C conformant, and it has minimal bootstrap dependencies &#8211; all you need is a &#8220;POSIX system with git, lua, curl, a sha256 utility, standard compression utilities, and an x86_64-linux-musl cross compiler&#8221;. The ISO C-comformance is a crucial part of one of Oasis&#8217; goals: to be buildable with cproc, a small, very strict C11 compiler. It has no package manager, but any software outside of Oasis itself can be installed and managed with pkgsrc or Nix. Another important goal of the project is to be extremely easy to understand, and its /etc directory is honestly a sight to behold, and as the project proudly claims, the most complex file in there is rc.init at a mere 16 lines. The configuration files are indeed incredibly easy to understand, which is a breath of fresh air compared to the archaic stuff in commercial UNIX or the complex stuff in modern Linux distributions that I normally deal with. I&#8217;m not sure is Oasis would make for a good, usable day-to-day operating system, but I definitely like what they&#8217;re putting down.

## Redox’ relibc becomes a stable ABI

date: 2025-02-10, from: OS News

The Redox project has posted its usual monthly update, and this time, we&#8217;ve got a major milestone creeping within reach. Thanks to Anhad Singh for his amazing work on Dynamic Linking! In this southern-hemisphere-Redox-Summer-of-Code project, Anhad has implemented dynamic linking as the default build method for many recipes, and all new porting can use dynamic linking with relatively little effort. This is a huge step forward for Redox, because relibc can now become a stable ABI. And having a stable ABI is one of the prerequisites for Redox to reach “Release 1.0”. ↫ Ribbon and Ron Williams A major step forward for Redox, and one of those things not everyone might think about when they consider the state of an operating system. This wasn&#8217;t all of the news this month, though, as Redox also received a port of the LOVE game engine, which powers quite a few successful indie games, like the recent hit Balatro. Thanks to this port, you can now play Balatro on Redox, which is pretty cool &#8211; and highlights just how far Redox has already come. On top of these major two headlines, there&#8217;s a ton of improvements all over the operating system, mostly at the lower levels.

## Rediscovering Plan 9 from Bell Labs

date: 2025-02-10, from: OS News

During a weekend of tidying up &#8211; you know, the kind of chore where you’re knee-deep in old boxes before you realize it. Digging through the dusty cables and old, outdated user manuals, I found something that I had long forgotten: an old&#160;Plan 9&#160;distribution. Judging by the faded ink and slight warping of the disk sleeve, it had to be from around 1994 or 1995. I couldn’t help but wonder: why had I kept this? Back then, I was curious about Plan 9. It was a forward-thinking OS that never quite reached full potential. Holding that disk, however, it felt more like a time capsule, a real reminder of computing’s advancements and adventurous spirit in the 1990s. ↫ Bill Dyer at It&#8217;s FOSS As the article notes, 9front is the way to go if you want to try Plan 9 today. Plan 9/9front appeals to a very specific type of person, but when you dive into the excellent &#8211; and incredibly entertaining &#8211; documentation, it really seems quite easy to grasp and get started with. There&#8217;s definitely things you&#8217;ll need to unlearn and some compromises you&#8217;ll need to make, but I think you&#8217;ll be able to get a lot more work done than you might think. Also, if you start adding software to 9front, you get to use the best GitHub alternative of all time: shithub. That alone makes it worth it to try 9front.

## FreeBSD and hi-fi audio setup: bit-perfect, equalizer, real-time

date: 2025-02-10, from: OS News

A complete guide to configuring FreeBSD as an audiophile audio server: setting up system and audio subsystem parameters, real-time operation, bit-perfect signal processing, and the best methods for enabling and parameterising the system graphic equalizer (equalizer) and high-quality audio equalization with FFmpeg filters. Linux users will also find useful information, especially in the context of configuring and personalising the MPD player and filters. ↫ Marcin Szewczyk-Wilgan FreeBSD is a much more capable desktop and workstation operating system than it gets credit for, especially with the Linux world sucking all the air out of the room, but you do often need to do a little more and dive a little deeper into the operating system to get it to do what you want. In the case of audio, Szewczyk-Wilgan explains that he thinks it&#8217;s even ahead of Linux, due to being able to &#8220;precisely track the parameters of the audio device along with the system kernel parameters and modify them&#8221;, as well as FreeBSD having better support for real-time operation. This guide is an incredibly detailed explanation of which options and configurations you should use in FreeBSD to turn it into an audio server. This clearly isn&#8217;t for everyone, and I assume most audio experts won&#8217;t be considering FreeBSD, but what this article demonstrates is that it&#8217;s very, very much possible to do so.

## Three years of ephemeral NixOS: my experience resetting root on every boot

date: 2025-02-10, from: OS News

We had a bit of a bug caused by changes we made to make quotes look better, but we&#8217;ve fixed it now, so we&#8217;re back on track (you may need to do a force-reload in your browser). Sorry for the disruption &#8211; and if you want to stay up-to-date on such issues next time it (inevitably) happens, you should follow the OSNews Fedi account (or just bookmark it without following it, if you&#8217;re not interested in social media). Anyway, back to the news! Fresh OS installs are bliss. But the joy fades quickly as installing and uninstalling programs leave behind a trail of digital debris. Even configuration management and declarative systems like NixOS miss crucial bits, like the contents of /var/lib or stray dotfiles. This debris isn’t just unsightly. It can be load-bearing, crucial to the functioning of your system, but outside of your control, and not preserved on rebuilds. Full system backups merely preserve this chaos. I wanted a clean slate, automatically, every boot. “Erase your darlings” inspired an idea in the NixOS community: allowlisting files and directories that persist across reboots. Anything not on the list gets wiped. The simplest implementation involves mounting / as a tmpfs (i.e.&#160;in RAM), and then bind-mounting or symlinking the allowlisted items to a disk-backed filesystem. ↫ Tuxes.uk I dabbled in NixOS over the past week or so, and while I find it intriguing and can definitely see a use for it, I also found it rather needlessly cumbersome and over-engineered for something as simple as a desktop system. I felt like I was taking a whole bunch of additional steps to do basic things, without needing any of the benefits Nix and NixOS bring. This doesn&#8217;t mean Nix and NixOS are bad &#8211; just that for me, personally, it doesn&#8217;t fill any need I have. Taking the Nix concept as far as starting with a completely fresh installation on every boot sounds absolutely insane to me. Of course, it&#8217;s not entirely fresh on every reboot, as several applications and important configuration elements do survive the reboot, but it&#8217;s still quite drastic compared to what everyone else is doing. Unsurprisingly, there are a few issues; it&#8217;s hard to know what really needs and doesn&#8217;t need saving, there might be some unexpected issues because software doesn&#8217;t expect to be wiped, and so on. Overall though, it seems to work susprisingly well, and for a specific type of person, this is definitely bliss.

In 2022, DARPA introduced NOM4D to break this cargo-constraint mold by exploring a new paradigm. Instead of folding or compacting structures to fit them into a rocket fairing to be unfurled or deployed in space, DARPA proposed stowing novel lightweight raw materials in the rocket fairing that don’t need to be hardened for launch. The intent of this approach is to allow in-orbit construction of vastly larger and more mass-efficient structures than could ever fit in a rocket fairing. Additionally, this concept enables mass-efficient designs of structures that would sag under their own weight on Earth but are optimized for the low-gravity environment of space.</p><p>“Caltech [California Institute of Technology] and the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign have demonstrated tremendous advances in the first two phases and have now partnered in Phase 3 with space-launch companies to conduct in-space testing of their novel assembly processes and materials,” said <a href="https://drupal.darpa.mil/about/people/andrew-detor">Andrew Detor, DARPA NOM4D program manager</a>. “Originally, Phase 3 was going to be about making things more precisely in the lab than we did in Phase 2. But we said, ‘You know, the maturity is there, and there would be more impact if we took the capabilities we have now and actually go demonstrate them in space to show that it can be done.’ Pushing the performers to do a demo in space means they can’t just sweep challenges under the rug like they could in a lab. You better figure out how it’s going to survive in the space environment.” &nbsp;</p><p>Caltech is focused on mass-efficient designs for in-space manufacturing and has teamed with Momentus Inc. to demonstrate its technology aboard the Momentus Vigoride Orbital Services Vehicle, launching into low-Earth orbit on the SpaceX Falcon 9 Transporter-16 mission scheduled for February 2026.</p><p>The Caltech experiment will be “free flying,” meaning it won’t involve human engagement once established in its orbit. Onboard cameras will provide real-time monitoring of structural assembly progress as a gantry robotic device autonomously assembles lightweight, composite fiber longerons (thin tubes) into a 1.4-meter-diameter circular truss to simulate the architectural structure of an antenna aperture. Think of it as an autonomous robotic assembly of a high-tech K’Nex or Tinkertoy structure to prove on a small scale that the manufacturing concept and materials function as designed in space.</p><p>“The Caltech demo won’t be building a radio frequency (RF) antenna with the required electronics; rather it will show us if their assembly tech works in space and if they can build a structure using thin composite tubes with surrogate RF mesh material hanging on the inside of the perimeter truss,” Detor said. “If the assembly technology is successful, this would be the first step toward scaling up to eventually building very large space-based structures in the future.” &nbsp;</p><p>The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign is focused on in-space materials and manufacturing and has developed a high-precision, in-space composite-forming process. They have partnered with Voyager Space aiming for launch to the International Space Station aboard NASA’s Commercial Resupply Mission NG-24, tentatively scheduled for April 2026. Their demo will take place in the Bishop Airlock module attached to the space station.</p><p>“The University of Illinois team will be conducting demonstrations of their technology using a sleeve of carbon fiber that lays flat – sort of like one of those finger traps you played with as a kid – but it’s made of carbon fiber that becomes the hardened reinforced structure later in the process,” Detor said. “Then they have a liquid monomer, which are molecules that have not polymerized, so they’re not solid yet. The chemistry of those monomers is really engineered for space launch – it’s got the shelf life you need and it’s able to survive the temperatures in space.</p><p>“The UIUC team has developed a unique way to trigger the polymerization, or hardening, chemical reaction. The process for most carbon fiber-reinforced epoxy, such as your skis or your tennis racket might be made of, involves bagging up the whole structure, infusing resin into the carbon fiber preform, and putting the whole thing into an autoclave to heat it up. If you want to construct a large structure in space, you don’t have a 100-meter autoclave you can put something into to heat it. So, they’ve developed what’s called a ‘frontal polymerization’ method, where you just ignite one end of the inside of the tube and the reaction self-propagates, stiffening the carbon tubes without heating up the whole structure. In theory, you could extend the process to produce very large structures once the polymerization process starts. You’d only be limited by the amount of feedstock coming into the process.”</p><p>A third team in NOM4D Phase 3, the University of Florida, is not involved in the in-space demonstrations but is working on innovative laser sheet metal bending techniques that could provide valuable manufacturing possibilities in space.</p><p>“The University of Florida is maturing the ability to bend metal using lasers and is working very closely with NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, to share their learnings,” Detor said. “Marshall has a laser space processing portfolio for welding and cutting metals, and we recently visited their facility to show them the University of Florida work and add bending metal to the capability mix.”</p><p>As NASA and commercial companies envision and develop plans for a space-based and lunar economy of the future, a major national security interest is space situational awareness – especially in the vast cislunar space, the region between Earth and the Moon. &nbsp;</p><p>“NOM4D aims to take the first small step to demo new technologies to see if in-orbit assembly of large structures is possible,” Detor said. “We’re paving the way for an in-space manufacturing ecosystem.</p><p>If we’re successful, we can look forward to scaling up this kind of technology to eventually build space-based RF antennas with 100-meter or greater diameter that would significantly improve our situational awareness of activity in the cislunar region and beyond. We can also envision NOM4D technologies enabling other massive structures in orbit, such as refueling stations for commercial or government spacecraft, spaced-based solar array farms, and many other commercial and national security applications.”</p><p id="1">[1] &nbsp;NOM4D stands for Novel Orbital and Moon Manufacturing, Materials, and Mass-efficient Design. The first two phases of the program included teams looking at Moon regolith (using Earth-based simulants) as a potential raw material for in-orbit manufacturing, but the final phase is focused solely on Earth-based materials and manufacturing processes for testing in space. No Moon-based technologies are being pursued in NOM4D.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div>
