## Tech execs are pushing Trump to build ‘Freedom Cities’ run by corporations

date: 2025-03-12, from: OS News

A new lobbying group, dubbed the Freedom Cities Coalition, wants to convince President Trump and Congress to authorize the creation of new special development zones within the U.S. These zones would allow wealthy investors to write their own laws and set up their own governance structures which would be corporately controlled and wouldn’t involve a traditional bureaucracy. The new zones could also serve as a testbed for weird new technologies without the need for government oversight. ↫ Lucas Ropek I mean, just in case you weren&#8217;t convinced yet these people are utterly insane. This is the kind of nonsensical libertarian Ayn Rand-inspired wank material dystopian fiction draws a lot of inspiration from, and it never ever ends well for anyone involved, especially not for the poor and lower classes inhabiting such places, because they&#8217;re supposed to be warnings, not instruction manuals. The fact that this insipid brand of utter stupidity is even considered by a president of the United States in this day and age should be all the proof you need that he and those around him have the moral compass of the rotting carcass of Margaret Thatcher. I can&#8217;t believe we have to tell these Silicon Valley &#8220;geniuses&#8221; that lawless corporate towns are bad. In 2025.

## The fascist tech bro takeover is here

date: 2025-03-11, from: OS News

The future of the United States is no longer decided in Washington. That ship has sailed. It&#8217;s now dictated in the bunkers, private jets, and compounds of an ideological Silicon Valley, by billionaires and wealth extremists intent on treating democracy as a nuisance that must be swatted away. These men &#8211; raised on a rabid press that mythologized their existence in their lifetimes, called them Wunderkind and treated them as something above and beyond mere mortality &#8211; have consumed a steady diet of libertarian and authoritarian fan fiction and conceived a new order, designed to elevate their lofty egos at any and all cost. The Internet was supposed to be the great equalizer. It was meant to be a force that shattered hierarchies and gave power to ordinary people. Instead, it enabled the wealth extraction and avarice of a cartel of overfed, over-pampered despots who enriched themselves in the name of innovation, bled the world to the point of near-total collapse, intellectualized their power fetish and now view public institutions as the final obstacles to be dismantled in their megalomanic pursuit of More. ↫ Joan Westenberg The US has only itself to blame. Let&#8217;s hope they don&#8217;t drag the rest of us with them.

## EU-US rift triggers call for made-in-Europe tech

date: 2025-03-11, from: OS News

The utter chaos in the United States and the country&#8217;s antagonistic, erratic, and often downright hostile approach to what used to be its allies has not gone unnoticed, and it seems it&#8217;s finally creating some urgency in an area in which people have been fruitlessly advocating for urgency for years: digital independence from US tech giants. Efforts to make Europe more technologically “sovereign” have gone mainstream. The European Commission now has its first-ever “technology sovereignty” chief, Henna Virkkunen. Germany’s incoming ruling party, the center-right Christian Democratic Union, called for “sovereign” tech in its program for the February election. “Mounting friction across the Atlantic makes it clearer than ever that Europe must control its own technological destiny,” said Francesca Bria, an innovation professor at University College London and former president of Italy’s National Innovation Fund. ↫ Pieter Haeck at Politico This should&#8217;ve been a primary concern for decades, as many have been trying to make it. Those calls usually fell on deaf ears, as relying on Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and other US tech giants was simply the cheapest option for EU governments and corporations alike. However, now that the US is suffering under a deeply dysfunctional, anti-EU regime, the chickens are coming home to roost, and it&#8217;s dawning on European politicians and business leaders alike that relying on US corporations that openly and brazenly cheer on the Trump/Elon regime might&#8217;ve been a bad idea. To the surprise of nobody with more than two brain cells. It&#8217;s going to take a long, long time for this situation to get any better. Europe simply doesn&#8217;t have any equivalents to the services offered by companies like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, and even if does, certainly not at their scale. Building up the resources these US companies offers is going to take a long time, and it won&#8217;t be cheap, making it hard to sell such moves to voters and shareholders alike, both of which are not exactly known for their long-term views on such complex matters. Still, it seems consumers in the EU might be more receptive to messages of digital independence from the US than ever before. Just look at how hard Tesla is tanking all over Europe, part of which can definitely be attributed to Europeans not wanting to buy any products from a man openly insulting and lying about European elected officials. If this groundswell of sentiment spreads, I can definitely see European politicians tapping into it to sell massive investments in digital independence. Personally, banning Twitter and Facebook from operating in the EU should be step one, as its owners have made it very clear that illegal election interference and nazi propaganda is something they have no issues with, followed by massive investments in alternatives to the services offered by the US big tech companies. China has been doing this for a long time now, and Europe should follow in its footsteps. There are enough bases to work from &#8211; from open source non-Google Android smartphones to EU-based Linux distributions for everything from desktops to server farms, and countless other open source services &#8211; so it&#8217;s not like we have to start from nothing. If we can spend €800 billion to finally get EU defense up to snuff, we should be able to spare something for digital independence, too.

## A 10x Faster TypeScript

date: 2025-03-11, from: OS News

To meet those goals, we’ve begun work on a native port of the TypeScript compiler and tools. The native implementation will drastically improve editor startup, reduce most build times by 10x, and substantially reduce memory usage. By porting the current codebase, we expect to be able to preview a native implementation of tsc capable of command-line typechecking by mid-2025, with a feature-complete solution for project builds and a language service by the end of the year. ↫ Anders Hejlsberg It seems Microsoft is porting TypeScript to Go, and WILL eventually offer both &#8220;TypeScript (JS)&#8221; and &#8220;TypeScript (native)&#8221; alongside one another during a transition period. TypeScript 6.x will be the JavaScript-based one and will continue to be developed until TypeScript 7.0, the Go-one, is mature enough. During the 6.x release cycle, however, there will be breaking changes and deprecations in preparation for 7.0. Those are some serious performance improvements, but I&#8217;m sure quite a few projects are going to run into issues during the transition period. I hope for them that the 6.x branch remains maintained for long enough to reasonably get everyone on board the new Go version.

## Exploring the (discontinued) hybrid Debian GNU/kFreeBSD distribution

date: 2025-03-10, from: OS News

For decades, Linux and BSD have stood as two dominant yet fundamentally different branches of the Unix-like operating system world. While Linux distributions, such as Debian, Ubuntu, and Fedora, have grown to dominate the open-source ecosystem, BSD-based systems like FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and NetBSD have remained the preferred choice for those seeking security, performance, and licensing flexibility. But what if you could combine the best of both worlds—Debian’s vast package ecosystem with FreeBSD’s robust and efficient kernel? Enter Debian GNU/kFreeBSD, a unique experiment that merges Debian’s familiar userland with the FreeBSD kernel, offering a hybrid system that takes advantage of FreeBSD’s technical prowess while maintaining the ease of use associated with Debian. This article dives into the world of Debian GNU/kFreeBSD, exploring its architecture, installation, benefits, challenges, and real-world applications. ↫ George Whittaker More of a list of upsides and downsides than an actual in-depth article, but that doesn&#8217;t make it any less interesting. There&#8217;s a variety of attempts out there to somehow marry the Linux and BSD worlds, and each of them takes a unique approach. I&#8217;m not sure the Debian userland with a FreeBSD kernel is the way to go, though, and it seems I&#8217;m not alone &#8211; Debian GNU/kFreeBSD was officially dropped from Debian in 2015 or so, and after a flurry of unofficial activity in 2019, it was discontinued completely in 2023 due to a lack of activity and developer interest. Odd that the source article doesn&#8217;t mention that. If you&#8217;re still interested in a combination of Linux and BSD, I&#8217;d keep an eye on Chimera Linux instead. It&#8217;s very actively developed, focuses on portable code by supporting many architectures, and its developers are veterans in this space. I have my eye on Chimera Linux as my future distribution of choice.

## Brother denies using firmware updates to brick printers with third-party ink

date: 2025-03-10, from: OS News

Brother laser printers are popular recommendations for people seeking a printer with none of the nonsense. By nonsense, we mean printers suddenly bricking features, like scanning or printing, if users install third-party cartridges. Some printer firms outright block third-party toner and ink, despite customer blowback and lawsuits. Brother’s laser printers have historically worked fine with non-Brother accessories. A YouTube video posted this week, though, as well as older social media posts, claim that Brother has gone to the dark side and degraded laser printer functionality with third-party cartridges. Brother tells Ars that this isn’t true. ↫ Scharon Harding at Ars Technica I find this an incredibly interesting story. We all know the printer space is a cursed hellhole of the very worst worst types of enshittification, but Brother seemed like an island of relative calm in a sea of bullshit. In turn, people are so used to printers being shit, that any problem that comes up is automatically explained by malice, which is not entirely unreasonable. Borther insists, though, that it does not break printers using third-party toner or ink through firmware. Brother does make it very clear that it is standard procedure to only perform troubleshooting on Brother printers using &#8216;genuine&#8217; Brother ink and toner, which is not entirely unreasonable in my book. There&#8217;s no telling what kind of effects third part cartridges &#8211; which do contain electronics &#8211; have on the rest of the printer, and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s fair to expect Brother to be able to document all of those possible issues. As long as using third-party toner and ink cartridges doesn&#8217;t invalidate any warranties, and as long as Brother doesn&#8217;t intentionally break printers for using third-party toner and ink, I think Brother meets its obligations to consumers. If you choose to use third-party ink and toner cartridges in Brother printers, I think it&#8217;s only reasonable you remove those during the troubleshooting process to ensure they&#8217;re not the cause of any problems you&#8217;re experiencing.
