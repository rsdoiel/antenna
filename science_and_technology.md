## That time Microsoft forgot the southern hemisphere’s seasons are opposite to the northern hemisphere’s

date: 2025-08-06, from: OS News

Whether you like Microsoft and its products or not, the one thing we can all agree on is that the company is absolutely terrible at naming things. Sometimes I feel like managers at Microsoft get their bonuses based on how many times they can rename products, because I find it hard to accept that they&#8217;re really that inept at product naming in Redmond. I mean, just look at my recent article about the most Microsoft support document of all time. Bonkers. While the list of examples of confusing, weird, unclear, and strange Microsoft product names is long, let&#8217;s go back to that weird moment in time where Windows updates were suddenly given names like the &#8220;Fall Creators Update&#8221;. As with every naming scheme Microsoft introduces, this one was short-lived, but for once, we have an explanation. Raymond Chen explains: It was during an all-hands meeting that a senior executive asked if the organization had any unconscious biases. One of my colleagues raised his hand. He grew up in the Southern Hemisphere, where the seasons are opposite from those in the Northern Hemisphere. He pointed out that naming the updates Spring and Fall shows a Northern Hemisphere bias and is not inclusive of our customers in the Southern Hemisphere. The names of the semiannual releases were changed the next day to be hemisphere-neutral. ↫ Raymond Chen If you live in the northern hemisphere &#8211; and you can&#8217;t live much more north than I do &#8211; you don&#8217;t often have to think about how the seasons in the southern hemisphere are reversed. We all know it &#8211; I assume, at least &#8211; but it&#8217;s not something that we&#8217;re confronted with very often, as our media, movies, books, and so on, all tend to be made in and for consumers in the northern hemisphere. I&#8217;m assuming that people in the southern hemisphere are much more acutely aware of this issue, because their media is probably dominated by stories set in the northern hemisphere, too. It&#8217;s wild that Microsoft ever went with a seasonal naming scheme to begin with, and that it somehow slipped through the cracks for a while before anyone spoke up.

## Proxmox Virtual Environment 9.0 with Debian 13 released

date: 2025-08-06, from: OS News

Main highlight of this update is a modernized core built upon Debian 13 “Trixie”, ensuring a robust foundation for the platform. Proxmox VE 9.0 further introduces significant advancements in both storage and networking capabilities, addressing critical enterprise demands. A highlight is the long-awaited support for snapshots on thick-provisioned LVM shared storage, improving storage management capabilities especially for enterprise users with Fibre Channel (FC) or iSCSI SAN environments. With newly added “fabric” support for Software-Defined Networking (SDN), administrators can construct highly complex and scalable network architectures. ↫ Proxmox press release I&#8217;ve only very recently accepted the gospel of Proxmox, and I now have a little mini PC running Proxmox, hosting a Debian Pi-Hole container, a 9front virtual machine, and a Windows 7 retro virtual machine. I&#8217;m intending to use it as an easy shortcut for running retro stuff, as well as any fun tools I might run into that work best in a container. I haven&#8217;t updated yet to this new release, but I&#8217;m interested to see how easy the upgrade process will be. Considering it&#8217;s just Debian, it can&#8217;t be too involved. I&#8217;m curious of anyone else here is using Proxmox or similar tools at home, or at work for more complex use cases.

## Writing a Rust GPU kernel driver: a brief introduction on how GPU drivers work

date: 2025-08-06, from: OS News

As promised in the first iteration, we will now explore how GPU drivers work in more detail by exploring an application known as&#160;VkCube. As the program name implies, this application uses the Vulkan API to render a rotating cube on the screen. Its simplicity makes it a prime candidate to be used as a learning aid in our journey through GPU drivers. This article will first introduce the concept of User Mode Drivers (UMDs) and Kernel Mode Drivers (KMDs), breaking down the steps needed to actually describe&#160;VkCube&#8216;s workload to the GPU. This will be done in a more compact way for brevity as it&#8217;s a rather extensive topic that has been detailed in several books. We will wrap up with an overview of the actual API offered by Tyr. As previously stated, this is the same API offered by Panthor, which is the C driver for the same hardware. ↫ Daniel Almeida There isn&#8217;t much to add here, except maybe this kitten.

## Windows NT 4.0 set us on the path to Windows NT desktop dominance

date: 2025-08-05, from: OS News

The most popular desktop operating system today is still Windows, with its userbase roughly equally divided between Windows 10 and Windows 11. While we tend to focus on the marketing names used by Microsoft, like Windows XP, Windows 7, or Windows 11, their real name is still, to this day, Windows NT. Underneath all the marketing names, there&#8217;s still the Windows NT version number corresponding to the marketing name; Windows XP was Windows NT 5.1 (or 5.2 for the 64bit version), Windows 7 was Windows NT 6.1, and the current latest version, Windows 11, is Windows NT 10.0, a version number that&#8217;s been static since 2015. Of course, version numbers don&#8217;t really mean anything, but it does highlight that yes, the Windows you&#8217;re using is still Windows NT, and thus, the operating system you&#8217;re using isn&#8217;t a part of the Windows 3.x/9x line, but of the NT line. And probably the first version of Windows NT that set us on this path is Windows NT 4.0 &#8211; with Windows 2000 sealing the deal, and Windows XP delivering the obvious knock-out punch. Since Windows NT 4.0 turned 29 years old a few days ago, Dave Farquhar published a retrospective of this release, highlighting many important changes in Windows NT 4.0 that in my mind mark it as the true beginning of the shift from Windows 9x to Windows NT as Microsoft&#8217;s consumer operating system. First, Windows NT 4.0 was the first version of Windows NT that shipped with the user interface from Windows 95. It brought over the Start menu, taskbar, and everything else introduced with Windows 95 to the Windows NT line, which up until that point had been using the same user interface as Windows 3.x. A default Windows NT 4.0 desktop basically looks indistinguishable from a Windows 95 desktop, and like the earlier versions of NT, it came in a workstation edition for desktop use. Second, another massive, at the time controversial, change came with the graphics subsystem, as Farquhar notes: And one change, easily forgotten today, regarded graphics drivers. Microsoft moved the video subsystem from user space, ring 3, to kernel space, ring 0. There was a lot of talk about Ring 0 versus ring 3 on July 19, 2024 thanks to the large computer outage on that day. In 1996, this move was controversial, for the same reasons. The fear was that a malfunction in the graphics driver would now be able to take down the entire system. But the trade-off was much improved performance. It meant Windows NT 4.0 could be used for serious graphics work. ↫ Dave Farquhar Windows NT 4.0 delivered more than what&#8217;s highlighted by Farquhar, of course. A major new feature in Windows NT 4.0 was DirectX, as it was the first Windows version to come with it preinstalled. DirectX support remained limited in NT 4.0, though, so Windows 9x remained the better option for most people playing video games. Other new features were the System Policy Editor and system policies, Sysprep, and, of course, a whole slew of low-level improvements to both the operating system itself as well as its various server-oriented features. Windows NT 4.0 also happened to be the last version of Windows NT which supported the Alpha, MIPS, and PowerPC architectures, although Windows 2000 retained support for Alpha in its alpha, beta, and release candidate versions. Of course, Windows would later expand its architecture support with first Itanium, and more recently, ARM. As someone who was selling and managing computer systems at the time, Farquhar has some great insights into why NT 4.0 was such a big deal, and why it seemed to fare better in the market than previous versions of Windows NT did. He also highlights on particular oddity from NT 4.0 that&#8217;s still lurking around today, an oddity you really don&#8217;t want to run into.

## Replacing an Amiga’s brain with Doom

date: 2025-08-05, from: OS News

There&#8217;s a lovely device called a&#160;pistorm, an adapter board that glues a Raspberry Pi GPIO bus to a Motorola 68000 bus. The intended use case is that you plug it into a 68000 device and then run an emulator that reads instructions from hardware (ROM or RAM) and emulates them. You&#8217;re still limited by the ~7MHz bus that the hardware is running at, but you can run the instructions as fast as you want. These days you&#8217;re supposed to run a custom built OS on the Pi that just does 68000 emulation, but initially it ran Linux on the Pi and a userland 68000 emulator process. And, well, that got me thinking. The emulator takes 68000 instructions, emulates them, and then talks to the hardware to implement the effects of those instructions. What if we, well, just don&#8217;t? What if we just run all of our code in Linux on an ARM core and then talk to the Amiga hardware? ↫ Matthew Garrett This is so cursed. I love it.

## Perplexity is using stealth, undeclared crawlers to evade website no-crawl directives

date: 2025-08-04, from: OS News

We are observing stealth crawling behavior from Perplexity, an AI-powered answer engine. Although Perplexity initially crawls from their declared user agent, when they are presented with a network block, they appear to obscure their crawling identity in an attempt to circumvent the website’s preferences. We see continued evidence that Perplexity is repeatedly modifying their user agent and changing their source&#160;ASNs&#160;to hide their crawling activity, as well as ignoring — or sometimes failing to even fetch —&#160;robots.txt&#160;files. The Internet as we have known it for the past three decades is&#160;rapidly changing, but one thing remains constant: it is built on trust. There are clear preferences that crawlers should be transparent, serve a clear purpose, perform a specific activity, and, most importantly, follow website directives and preferences. Based on Perplexity’s observed behavior, which is incompatible with those preferences, we have de-listed them as a verified bot and added heuristics to our managed rules that block this stealth crawling. ↫ The CloudFlare Blog Never forget they destroyed Aaron Swartz&#8217;s life &#8211; literally &#8211; for downloading a few JSTOR articles.

## Orbitiny Desktop 1.0 Pilot 4 released

date: 2025-08-03, from: OS News

It&#8217;s not every day you stumble upon an X11 desktop environment you&#8217;ve never hard of, but today&#8217;s one of those days. The Orbitiny Desktop Environment is a one-person project, consisting of an entirely custom desktop environment written in Qt. Version 1.0 Pilot 4 was just released. Built from the ground up using Qt and coded in C++, Orbitiny Desktop is a new, 100% portable, innovative and traditional but modern looking desktop environment for Linux. Innovative because it has features not seen in any other desktop environment before while keeping traditional aspects of computing alive (desktop icons, menus etc). Portable because you can run it on any distro and on any live CD and that&#8217;s because everything gets saved inside the directory that gets created when the archive is extracted (this can be changed so that the settings go to $HOME/.config/orbitiny). ↫ Orbitiny Desktop Environment Gitea page It&#8217;s got all the usual amenities like a desktop, panels, and so on, and a custom file manager. It&#8217;s also replete with a ton of small features that you don&#8217;t see very often, like full mouse gesture support on the desktop and a device manager that can enable/disable devices without blacklisting kernel modules. When you cut or copy a file, its icon will get a little emblem to indicate it&#8217;s on the clipboard, you can append and prepend files using simple drag-and-drop operations, you can set individual desktop directories for each virtual desktop, and much more. Now, it&#8217;s technically not a full desktop environment, because it doesn&#8217;t have things like a session manager, power manager, various hardware configuration panels, and so on, but it can be run on top of existing desktop environments. While it has basic Wayland support, not all components work there, so X11 is the main focus for now. Considering it&#8217;s a one-person project, you can&#8217;t expect a bug or issue-free experience, but that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s any less damn impressive. I honestly feel like there&#8217;s something valuable and interesting here, and I&#8217;d love for more people to get involved to see where this can go. There&#8217;s clearly a ton of love and dedication here, and the various unique features clearly set it apart from everything else. If you have the skills, consider helping out.

## Introduction to Qubes OS when you do not know what it is

date: 2025-08-03, from: OS News

Solène Rapenne, who writes a lot about and contributes to operating systems like OpenBSD and Qubes OS, has published a primer about what, exactly, Qubes OS is. I like to call Qubes OS a meta operating system, because it is not a Linux / BSD / Windows based OS: its core is Xen (some kind of virtualization enabled kernel). Not only it&#8217;s Xen based, but by design it is meant to run virtual machines, hence the name &#8220;meta operating system&#8221; which is an OS meant to run many OSes make sense to me. ↫ Solène Rapenne Rapenne explains the various ways in which isolated virtual machines are used in Qubes OS, and it&#8217;s easy to see just how secure Qubes OS&#8217; way of doing things is. At the same time, it seems quite cumbersome to me as a regular user, and I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m up for dealing with all of that. If you do security research, handle private or classified data, are a whistleblower or an investigative journalist, thoug, Qubes seems like a natural choice. Interesting to note is that Rapenne used to use OpenBSD for her security work, but moved to Qubes OS because its virtual machine infrastructure is far more robust, and hardware support is better, as well.

## A real PowerBook: the Macintosh Application Environment on a PA-RISC laptop

date: 2025-08-03, from: OS News

In October 1997 you could have bought a PowerBook 3400c running up to a 240MHz PowerPC 603e for $6500 , which was briefly billed as the world&#8217;s fastest laptop, or you could have bought this monster new to the market, the RDI PrecisionBook running up to a 160MHz (later 180MHz) PA-7300LC starting at $12,000 . Both provided onboard Ethernet, SCSI and CardBus PCMCIA slots. On the other hand, while the 3400c had an internal media bay for either a floppy or CD-ROM, both external options on the PrecisionBook, the PrecisionBook gave you a 1024&#215;768 LCD (versus 800&#215;600 on the 3400c), a bigger keyboard, at least two 2.5&#8243; hard disk bays and up to 512MB of RAM (versus 144MB) — and HP-UX. And, through the magic of Apple&#8217;s official Macintosh Application Environment, you could do anything on it an HP PA-RISC workstation could do and run 68K Mac software on it at the same time. Look at the photograph and see: on our 160MHz unit we&#8217;ve got HP-UX 11.00 CDE running simultaneously with a full Macintosh System 7.5.3 desktop. Yes, only a real Power Mac could run PowerPC software back then, but 68K software was still plentiful and functional. Might this have been a viable option to have your expensive cake and eat it too? We&#8217;ll find out and run some real apps on it (including&#160;that&#160;game we must all try running), analyze its performance and technical underpinnings, and uncover an unusual artifact of its history hidden in the executable. ↫ Cameron Kaiser at Old Vintage Computing Research I actually have Apple&#8217;s Macintosh Application Environment installed and running on my PA-RISC machines, and it&#8217;s incredible just how well-made and complete it really is. You get a full Mac desktop and its applications, excellent integration with the host, file sharing between host and client, and so much more. Running it on newer versions of HP-UX than it was originally intended for does lead to the odd issue here and there, but due to HP-UX&#8217; excellent backwards compatibility, it all just works. It has created this odd situation that my 2004 HP c8000 machine, with two of the fastest dual-core PA-RISC processors ever made, will most likely be the fastest machine I&#8217;ll ever officially run classic Mac OS on. Sure, you can use other emulators not created and blessed by Apple and run classic Mac OS on much faster hardware, but if you want to stick to official, supported methods of running the classic Mac OS, it doesn&#8217;t get much faster than this.

## “AWS deleted my 10-year account and all data without warning”

date: 2025-08-03, from: OS News

AWS: Not even once. This prominent Ruby developer lost his entire test environment &#8211; which, ironically, was pivotal to AWS&#8217; own infrastructure &#8211; because of a rogue team within AWS itself that apparently answers to no one and worked hard to cover up a dumb mistake. On July 23, 2025, AWS deleted my 10-year-old account and every byte of data I had stored with them. No warning. No grace period. No recovery options. Just complete digital annihilation. This is the story of a catastrophic internal mistake at AWS MENA, a 20-day support nightmare where I couldn’t get a straight answer to “Does my data still exist?”, and what it reveals about trusting cloud providers with your data. ↫ Abdelkader Boudih Nightmare scenario doesn&#8217;t even begin to describe what happened here.
