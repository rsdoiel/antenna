<p>
Today I saw somebody posting a message about Trump’s threats to annex
Canada from a friend that wanted to remain anonymous. It seems pretty
important to me because that’s how every former friend of the US is
going to react. Greenland is an autonomous territory in the Kingdom of
Denmark. Denmark is part of Europe. Denmark spent a lot to support
Ukraine. The USA threatened to abandon Ukraine. Both Denmark and Canada
are part of NATO. The USA is not behaving like a friend and ally. Not at
all.
</p>
<p>
Trump is a Russian asset.
</p>
<p>
People will remember.
</p>
<p>
For reference, aid to Ukraine:
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="ukraine-aid-2025.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
The US has contributed $69bn, Europe has contributed $66bn, the biggest
contributors being Germany with $13.6bn, UK with $10.8bn, Denmark with
$8.1bn, and so on. Source:

Institute for the World Economy: War against Ukraine</a>.
</p>
<p>
Here’s the message I mentioned at the top:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
One thing I’ve learned over the past few weeks, and it’s been a bit of a
sobering lesson, is that a lot of Americans I know don’t actually know
what’s going on between the US and Canada right now, and just how
seriously Canadians are taking this. So, against my better judgement,
here’s a timeline to explain why we’re here, and why we’re angry.
</p>
<p>
Nov 30th, 2018. The United States, Canada and Mexico finalize a trade
agreement. Trump personally negotiates the terms and signs the document,
celebrating it as ‘the greatest trade agreement in history”. (This is
important.)
</p>
<p>
Nov 29th, 2024. In a face to face meeting, Trump threatens the Canadian
Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, that he will be imposing 25% tariffs and
that if Canada wants to avoid that, it should join the US as a state.
</p>
<p>
Nov 30th, 2024. Trump publicly calls our Prime Minister ‘Governor
Trudeau’ and instructs his staff to only address him as Governor going
forward. He again suggests Canada should join the USA.
</p>
<p>
Dec 3rd, 2024. Trump remarks that he would split Canada into two states
once annexed.
</p>
<p>
Dec 10th, 2024. Trump posts that the majority of Canadians support
annexation, despite public polling that only 13% of Canadians would
consider the idea.
</p>
<p>
Dec 18th, 2024. Trump again falsely states that the majority of
Canadians support annexation and that one of his lapdogs, Wayne Gretzky,
should have a leadership role in that new scenario.
</p>
<p>
Jan 7th, 2025. At a press conference, Trump says that he would use
economic force to destroy the Canadian economy to annex it.
</p>
<p>
Jan 14, 2025. Trump again claims that most Canadians want to be
American, despite new polls showing only 10% of us are open to the idea.
</p>
<p>
Jan 20th, 2025. During his inaugural address, Trump says that the U.S.
will ‘expand its territory’ during his second term.
</p>
<p>
Jan 23rd, 2025. At the World Economic Forum, Trump says that Canada can
avoid tariffs and economic collapse if it joins the US. He says this in
front of representatives from most countries in the world.
</p>
<p>
Jan 24th, 2025. Trump states publicly that Canada ‘will’ become a state
</p>
<p>
Jan 31st, 2025. Trump announces a 25% tariff on all Canadian imports to
begin the next day.
</p>
<p>
Feb 2nd, 2025. Trump refers to Canada as its ‘Cherished 51st state’ and
that it should join the US to avoid tariffs.
</p>
<p>
Feb 3rd, 2025. A one month delay is agreed upon. Trump, in a
conversation with Trudeau states that he doesn’t think existing border
treaties with Canada are valid, and need to be revised.
</p>
<p>
Feb 7th, 2025. In a closed door meeting with his cabinet, Prime Minister
Trudeau is recorded, without his knowledge, telling everyone that he
believes very strongly that Trump is serious and that he stated his
reason for annexation as Canadian resources.
</p>
<p>
Feb 9th, 2025. In a Super Bowl pre-game interview, Trump says that he’s
serious about his threats, calling it a ‘viable consideration for
expanding US territory’
</p>
<p>
Feb 10th, 2025. Trump announces an additional 25% tariffs on steel and
aluminum imports from Canada to come into effect March 12th.
</p>
<p>
Feb 24th, 2025. Trump publicly remarks that whoever signed the USMCA
agreement is an idiot. He was the one that signed it.
</p>
<p>
March 4th, 5th, and 6th 2025. Tariffs come into effect. Canada
retaliates with it’s own tariffs. Tariffs are again postponed until
April 1st after a huge market backlash.
</p>
<p>
March 4th, 2025. In an address to a joint session of congress, Trump
states that the US will own Greenland ‘one way or the other’.
</p>
<p>
March 5th, 2025. US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick told Canadian
finance minister Dominic LeBlanc that Trump “had come to realize that
the relationship between the United States and Canada was governed by a
slew of agreements and treaties that were easy to abandon.”
</p>
<p>
March 7th, 2025. Unconfirmed Memorandum and maps leaked on twitter
reveal Trump is allegedly planning to annex the entirety of the great
lakes and Southern Ontario, home to 13,491,332 Canadians. This amounts
to 35.25% of Canada’s total population and includes its largest city,
Toronto. This region accounts for 38% of the Canadian economy, and its
loss would make Canada’s independence functionally impossible.
</p>
<p>
March 8th, 2025. Canada’s foreign minister warns European allies that
their government considers Canada to be under existential threat.
</p>
<p>
March 9th, 2025. Mark Carney, the new Canadian Prime Minister, in his
acceptance speech, states that Trump is seeking to destroy Canada, and
its way of life.
</p>
<p>
March 11, 2025. President Trump threatens to “permanently shut down the
automobile manufacturing business in Canada” if Canada does not drop a
250% to 390% tariff on U.S. dairy products, which he doesn’t state only
kicks in after a certain quantity of tariff-free U.S. dairy enters
Canada, a quantity that was originally negotiated and agreed to by Trump
during the USMCA in 2018.
</p>
<p>
In Trump’s own words, “The only thing that makes sense is for Canada to
become our cherished Fifty First State. This would make all Tariffs, and
everything else, totally disappear.
</p>
<p>
Canadians’ taxes will be very substantially reduced, they will be more
secure, militarily and otherwise, than ever before, there would no
longer be a Northern Border problem, and the greatest and most powerful
nation in the World will be bigger, better and stronger than ever — And
Canada will be a big part of that. The artificial line of separation
drawn many years ago will finally disappear, and we will have the safest
and most beautiful Nation anywhere in the World — And your brilliant
anthem, “O Canada,” will continue to play, but now representing a GREAT
and POWERFUL STATE within the greatest Nation that the World has ever
seen!”
</p>
<p>
March 11th, 2025 PT. II. Peter Navarro, a Senior Advisor for Trump is
interviewed by MSNBC. When asked about the tariffs he responds with
“Just tamp it down, please, over there, ok? They’re throwing down the
hockey gloves. Stop that rhetoric…we’re not going to tolerate anything
but them stopping killing Americans”, insinuating that this situation
was caused by Canadians killing Americans.
</p>
<p>
March 11th, 2025 PT III. Trump again publicly muses that Canada,
Greenland, and the US should be one country, and questions the validity
of the Canadian and American border.
</p>
<p>
To my American friends, I know most of you are amazing and generous
people. You didn’t ask for this, and I understand that. I hold no ill
will towards you, whatsoever. But I must stress, with as much
seriousness as I can, the amount of damage this has done.
</p>
<p>
We have viewed you as our closest friend and ally for a century. We
thought of you as brothers and sisters. We answered the call, again and
again, for any support you needed from us. Most of Canadians visit the
USA so much that we’ve seen more of the US than we have the rest of
Canada.
</p>
<p>
American products have been taken off our shelves. Canadians are
cancelling travel plans to the US. Photo after photo has been shared on
social media of empty flights from Canada to the USA.
</p>
<p>
This isn’t a joke to us. We’re not overreacting. We don’t think he’s
just saying this shit to cause chaos or negotiate a deal. We
wholeheartedly believe that our closest ally and friend is about to
bring violence across our border, economically destroy us, and eliminate
our way of life.
</p>
<p>
The main driver for Canada’s creation in 1867 was SPECIFICALLY to not be
part of America, and to end America’s very public threats and plans to
annex our territory.
</p>
<p>
We’re angry. We’re really, really fucking angry. Open your eyes to
what’s happening because we’re tired of trying to make you understand
why and asking you why it seems like none of you care. **
</p>
<p>
I still hope that there is time to repair this. I still believe that
this is the result of one man’s plan to burn it all down. But time is
running out, and fast.

</h1>
<p>
I’m giving <a href="https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri">niri</a> a go. The
idea is that a scrollable tiling window manager (“Wayland compositor”)
is a better fit than just a tiling window manager. For tiling window
managers, I just create new stuff and have it maximized. I really can’t
do the quick splitting and rearranging that it seems to afford. The
result is that I start moving stuff to other workspaces, where they’re
invisible and gone. I’m hoping that new windows popping up next to
existing windows makes it feel like a stack.
</p>
<p>
Having gone through the config file and having made a few small changes
it already feels pretty nice. Right now one of the problems I have is
that by sheer bad luck I decided to rotate my external monitor by 90°
and that doesn’t work quite as well, maybe? I’m not sure. One of the
first changes I did was change the default widths from ⅓ / ½ / ⅔ to 0.95
/ ⅔ / ½ with 0.95 being the default.

<p>I’d love to get a list of old school bloggers who are still at it.
How would you go about that? I decided to give it to Gemini, limiting it
at first to 100 bloggers. Here’s the
<a href="https://daveverse.wordpress.com/2025/03/15/finding-old-school-bloggers-who-are-still-at-it/">prompt</a>
I wrote. For a while I was wondering what “deep research” was for, but
as it’s starting the work, I’m thinking of resources that would fit in –
like blogtree.com – a fascinating site, gives a clear picture how blogs
emerge out of the community of an earlier blog. Anyway it’s working on
it while I write this post. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span></p>

<p>An application ChatGPT is great it. You’re staring at some code, it’s
really straightforward, you’ve done this a thousand times, but it
doesn’t work. Stare at it some more. Try re-entering it. Change the
names of things. Still doesn’t work. Copy and paste the problem code
into ChatGPT and in an instant it tells you without you even having to
ask that your comment isn’t properly terminated, so the runtime was
never seeing the code, and nothing I did made the slightest difference.
The information was there. I had been staring at it, but humans see what
we expect to see. Machines don’t have that problem, at least not in this
way (thinking of hallucinations).</p>

<a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/67d580b2-8a68-8012-ad1a-65f2553978bb">ChatGPT</a>
when Google started making HTTPS a requirement. Then I asked when was
HTTPS first deployed, and was surprised it was in 1994 in Netscape
Navigator. But apparently it was really buggy and wasn’t codified until
much later. Then I asked when HTTPS became the norm? 2017. So there’s a
lot of web out there that isn’t being maintained by anyone, it just
works, that predates HTTPS being widely adopted, if you believe the
timelines ChatGPT produced.</p>

is scripting.com not https? I hope you can see that I have no trouble
deploying https sites here. I use
<a href="https://caddyserver.com/">Caddy</a> on my Linux servers, and I
don’t see why anyone uses anything else. It’s really easy and requires
none of the work people complain about. Anyway the reason scripting.com
is http and not https is that the site dates back to 1994, before there
was such a thing as https. Google didn’t start their push to get the web
to convert to https until 2014, 20 years after I started blogging. Have
a look at <a href="http://scripting.com/1999/12/31.html">any</a> of
<a href="http://scripting.com/fatpages/about.html">my</a>

<a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1999/05/24/editThisPage.html">posts</a>
and <a href="http://scripting.com/frontier/olddefault.html">docs</a>,
the’re pretty much all there. This is something I’m proud of. I wanted
to create a record from the start, it was very deliberate. I was already
an experienced developer when the web started up, so I had an idea what
I was doing. I also use images on my site, in the right margin of posts,
and lately as “inline” images, in their own boxes with a caption. It’s a
way for me to play with the ideas, and adds color to pages that are
almost all text. So if I were to move the site from S3 to one of my
hosted servers, which would be a fairly major undertaking on its own and
add a lot of overhead because Amazon takes care of a lot of the bullshit
you have to deal with, there would be a small matter of what about the
images? They would all break if scripting.com was hosted on https and
they were served from http. Now you might say – Dave all you have to do
is move all those images to a place with https support and remap the
domains, and take care of all the michegas that’s going to pop up. Or
suffer with broken images. I decided to instead tell Google to stop
trying to own something that belongs to no one and everyone. If they
want a more secure web, create it, and make a browser for it, and
respect the original web alone. Hopefully this clears it up.</p>

Introduction
</h2>
I’m honored to appear in what I believe is the final series of these
seminars. Most of my previous appearances have focused on debunking some
conventional wisdom, and this one is no exception. My parting gift to
you is to stop you wasting time and resources on yet another seductive
but impractical idea — that the solution to storing archival data is
quasi-immortal media. As usual, you don’t have to take notes. The full
text of my talk with the slides and links to the sources will go up on
my blog shortly after the seminar.<br />

</div>
Archival data is often confused with backup data. Everyone should back
up their data. After nearly two decades working in digital preservation,
here is how I back up my four important systems:<br />
<ul>
<li>
I run my own mail and Web server. It is on my DMZ network, exposed to
the Internet. It is backed up to a Raspberry Pi, also on the DMZ network
but not directly accessible from the Internet. Once a week there is a
full backup, and daily an incremental backup. Every week the full and
incremental backups for the week are written to two DVD-Rs.
</li>
<li>
My desktop PC creates a full backup on an external hard drive nightly.
The drive is one of a cycle of three.
</li>
<li>
I back up my iPhone to my Mac Air laptop every day.
</li>
<li>
I create a Time Machine backup of my Mac Air laptop, which includes the
most recent iPhone backup, every day on one of a cycle of
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/01/a-lesson-learned.html">three
external SSDs</a>.
</li>
</ul>
Each week the DVD-Rs, the current SSD and the current hard drive are
moved off-site. Why am I doing all this? In case of disasters such as
fire or ransomware I want to be able to recover to a state as close as
possible to that before the disaster. In my case, the worst case is not
more than one week.<br /> <br /> Note the implication that the useful
life of backup data is only the time that elapses between the last
backup before a disaster and the recovery. Media life span is irrelevant
to backup data; that is why backups and archiving are <i>completely
different problems</i>.<br /> <br /> The fact that the data encoded in
magnetic grains on the platters of the three hard drives is
<a href="https://www.abitare.org/papers/ISandT2008.pdf">good for a
quarter-century</a> is interesting but irrelevant to the backup
task.<br /> <br />

I have saved many hundreds of pairs of weekly DVD-Rs but the only ones
that are ever accessed more than a few weeks after being written are the
ones I use for my annual series of
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/08/2024-optical-media-durability-update.html"><i>Optical
Media Durability Update</i></a> posts. It is interesting that:<br />
<blockquote>
with no special storage precautions, generic low-cost media, and
consumer drives, I’m getting good data from CD-Rs more than 20 years
old, and from DVD-Rs nearly 18 years old.
</blockquote>
But the DVD-R media lifetime is not why I’m writing backups to them. The
attribute I’m interested in is that DVD-Rs are <i>write-once</i>; the
backup data could be destroyed but it can’t be modified.<br /> <br />
Note that the good data from 18-year-old DVD-Rs means that consumers
have an affordable, effective archival technology. But the market for
optical media and drives is dying, killed off by streaming, which
suggests that consumers don’t really care about archiving their data.
Cathy Marshall’s 2008 talk
<a href="http://www.usenix.org/events/fast08/tech/marshall.pdf"><i>Its
Like A Fire, You Just Have To Move On</i></a> vividly describes this
attitude. Her subtitle is “Rethinking personal digital archiving”.<br />

<ul>
<li>
Over time, data falls down the storage hierarchy.
</li>
<li>
Data is archived when it can’t earn its keep on near-line media.
</li>
<li>
Lower cost is purchased with longer access latency.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
What is a useful definition of archival data? It is data that can no
longer earn its keep on readily accessible storage. Thus the fundamental
design goal for archival storage systems is to reduce costs by
tolerating increased access latency. Data is archived, that is moved to
an archival storage system, to save money. Archiving is an
<i>economic</i> rather than a technical issue.<br /> <br />

How long should the archived data last? The
<a href="https://longnow.org/">Long Now Foundation</a> is building the
<a href="https://longnow.org/clock/">Clock of the Long Now</a>, intended
to keep time for 10,000 years. They would like to accompany it with a
10,000-year archive. That is at least two orders of magnitude longer
than I am talking about here. We are only just over 75 years from the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_Baby">first
stored-program computer</a>, so designing a digital archive for a
century is a very ambitious goal.<br />

Six years later, this is a picture of, as far as I know, the only
write-to-read DNA storage drive ever demonstrated. It is from the
Microsoft/University of Washington team that has done much of the
research in DNA storage. They published it in 2019’s
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-41228-8"><i>Demonstration of
End-to-End Automation of DNA Data Storage</i></a>. It cost about $10K
and took 21 hours to write then read 5 bytes. <br /> <br /> The
technical press is equally guilty. The canonical article about some
development in the lab starts with the famous IDC graph projecting the
amount of data that will be generated in the future. It goes on to
describe the amazing density some research team achieved by writing say
a gigabyte into their favorite medium in the lab, and how this density
could store all the world’s data in a teacup for ever. This conveys five
false impressions.<br />
<h3>
Market Size
</h3>
First, that there is some possibility the researchers could scale their
process up to a meaningful fraction of IDC’s projected demand, or even
to the microscopic fraction of the projected demand that makes sense to
archive. There is no such possibility. Archival media is a much
<i>smaller</i> market than regular media. In 2018’s

Georg Lauhoff and Gary M Decad’s slide</a> shows that the size of the
market in dollar terms <i>decreases</i> downwards. LTO tape is less than
1% of the media market in dollar terms and less than 5% in capacity
terms. Archival media are a very small part of the storage market. It is
noteworthy that in 2023 Optical Archival (OD-3), the most recent
archive-only medium, was canceled for lack of a large enough market. It
was a 1TB optical disk, an upgrade from Blu-Ray.<br />

Timescales

Second, that the researcher’s favorite medium could make it into the
market in the timescale of IDC’s projections. Because the reliability
and performance requirements of storage media are so challenging, time
scales in the storage market are much longer than the industry’s
marketeers like to suggest.<br /> <br />

Take, for example, Seagate’s development of the next generation of hard
disk technology, HAMR, where research started
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190813175046/https://www.seagate.com/news/news-archive/seagate-swings-increase-disc-drive-densities-master-pr/">twenty-six
years ago</a>. Nine years later in 2008 they published this graph,
showing HAMR entering the market in 2009. Seventeen years later it is
only now starting to be shipped to the hyper-scalers. Research on data
in silica started
<a href="https://www.storagenewsletter.com/2014/10/31/rd-hitachi-rw-of-digital-data-in-fused-silica-glass/">fifteen
years ago</a>. Research on the DNA medium started
<a href="https://doi.org/10.2307/777811">thirty-six years ago</a>.
Neither is within five years of market entry.<br />

Customers

Third, that even if the researcher’s favorite medium did make it into
the market it would be a product that consumers could use. As
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/09/more-on-facebooks-cold-storage.html">Kestutis
Patiejunas figured out</a> at Facebook more than a decade ago, because
the systems that surround archival media rather than the media
themselves are the major cost, the only way to make the economics of
archival storage work is to do it at data-center scale but in warehouse
space and harvest the synergies that come from not needing data-center
power, cooling, staffing, etc.<br /> <br />

Storage has an analog of Moore’s Law called
<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/kryders-law/">Kryder’s
Law</a>, which states that over time the density of bits on a storage
medium increases exponentially. Given the need to reduce costs at
data-center scale, Kryder’s Law limits the service life of even
quasi-immortal media. As we see with tape robots, where data is
routinely migrated to newer, denser media long before its theoretical
lifespan, what matters is the economic, not the technical lifespan of a
medium.<br /> <br /> Hard disks are replaced every five years although
the magnetically encoded data on the platters is
<a href="https://www.abitare.org/papers/ISandT2008.pdf">good for a
quarter-century</a>. They are engineered to have a five-year life
because Kryder’s Law implies that they will be replaced after five years
even though they still work perfectly. Seagate actually built drives
with 25-year life but found that no-one would pay the extra for the
longer life.<br />

Fourth, that anyone either cares or even knows what medium their
archived data lives on. Only the hyper-scalers do. Consumers believe
their data is safe in the cloud. Why bother backing it up, let alone
archiving it, if it is safe anyway? If anyone really cares about
archiving they use a service such as Glacier, when they definitely have
no idea what medium is being used.<br />

Fifth, that bit rot is the only threat that matters; the idea that with
quasi-immortal media you don’t need Lots Of Copies to Keep Stuff
Safe.<br /> <br /> No medium is perfect. They all have a specified
Unrecoverable Bit Error Rate (UBER) rate. For example, typical
<a href="https://www.seagate.com/content/dam/seagate/en/content-fragments/products/datasheets/exos-x24/exos-x24-DS2080-2307US-en_US.pdf">disk
UBERs are 10<sup>-15</sup></a>. A petabyte is 8*10<sup>15</sup> bits, so
if the drive is within its specified performance you can expect up to 8
errors when reading a petabyte. The specified UBER is an upper limit,
you will normally see
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2005/12/tr-2005-166.pdf">far
fewer</a>. The
<a href="https://cdn.allbound.com/iq-ab/2022/12/LTO-9-TB00068A.pdf">UBER
for LT09 tape is 10<sup>-20</sup></a>, so unrecoverable errors on a new
tape are very unlikely. But not impossible, and the rate goes up steeply
with tape wear.<br /> <br /> The property that classifies a medium as
quasi-immortal is not that its reliability is greater than regular media
to start with, although as with tape it may be. It is rather that its
reliability decays more slowly than that of regular media. Thus archival
systems need to use erasure coding to mitigate both UBER data loss and
media failures such as disk crashes and tape wear-out.<br /> <br />
Another reason for needing erasure codes is that media errors are not
the only ones needing mitigation. What matters is the reliability the
system delivers to the end user. Research has shown that the
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2008/03/more-bad-news-on-storage-reliability.html">majority
of end user errors</a> come from layers of the system above the actual
media.<br /> <br /> The archive may contain personally identifiable or
other sensitive data. If so, the data on the medium must be encrypted.
This is a double-edged sword, because the encryption key becomes a
single point of failure; its loss or corruption renders the entire
archive inaccessible. So you need Lots Of Copies to keep the key safe.
But the more copies the greater the risk of key compromise.<br /> <br />
Media such as silica, DNA, quartz DVDs, steel tape and so on address bit
rot, which is only one of the threats to which long-lived data is
subject. Clearly a single copy on such media, even if erasure coded, is
still subject to threats including fire, flood, earthquake, ransomware,
and insider attacks. Thus even an archive needs to maintain multiple
copies. This greatly increases the cost, bringing us back to the
economic threat.<br /> <br />
<h2>
Archival Storage Systems
</h2>
At Facebook Patiejunas built rack-scale systems, each holding 10,000
100GB optical disks for a Petabyte per rack. Writable Blu-Ray disks are
about 80 cents each, so the media to fill the rack would cost about $8K.
This is clearly much less than the cost of the robotics and the
drives.<br /> <br />

Let’s drive this point home with another example. An
<a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/ts4300">IBM TS4300</a> LTO tape
robot
<a href="https://www.ibm.com/flashsystem/pricing/us-en/family/TP9JK5">starts
at $20K</a>. Two 20-pack tape cartridges to fill it cost about $4K, so
the media is about 16% of the total system capex. The opex for the robot
includes power, cooling, space, staff and an IBM maintenance contract.
The opex for the tapes is essentially zero.<br /> <br /> The media is an
insignificant part of the total lifecycle cost of storing archival data
on tape. What matters for the economic viability of an archival storage
system is minimizing the total system cost, not the cost of the media.
No-one is going to spend $24K on a rack-mount tape system from IBM to
store 720TB for their home or small business. The economics only work at
data-center scale.<br /> <br /> The reason why this focus on media is a
distraction is that the fundamental problem of digital preservation is
economic, not technical. No-one wants to pay for preserving data that
isn’t earning its keep, pretty much the definition of archived data. The
cost per terabyte of the <i>medium</i> is irrelevant, what drives the
economic threat is the capital and operational cost of the
<i>system</i>. Take tape for example. The media capital cost is low, but
the much higher system capital cost includes the drives and the
robotics. Then there are the operational costs of the data center space,
power, cooling and staff. It is only by operating at data-center scale
and thus amortizing the capital and operational costs over very large
amounts of data that the system costs per terabyte can be made
competitive.<br /> <br /> Operating at data center scale, as
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/09/more-on-facebooks-cold-storage.html">Patiejunas
discovered</a> and
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2025/01/storage-roundup.html">Microsoft
understands</a>, means that one of the parameters that determines the
system cost is <i>write bandwidth</i>. Each of Facebook’s racks wrote 12
optical disks in parallel almost continuously. It would take over 800
times the time to write an entire disk to fill the rack. At the 8x write
speed it takes
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blu-ray#Drive_speeds">22.5
minutes</a> to fill a disk, so it would take around 18,750 minutes to
fill the rack, or about two weeks. It isn’t clear how many racks
Facebook needed simultaneously doing this to keep up with the flow of
user-generated content, but it was likely enough to fill a
reasonable-size warehouse. Similarly, it would take about 8.5 days to
fill the

A <i>Silica library</i> is a sequence of contiguous write, read, and
storage racks interconnected by a platter delivery system. Along all
racks there are parallel horizontal rails that span the entire library.
We refer to a side of the library (spanning all racks) as a
<i>panel</i>. A set of <i>free roaming</i> robots called <i>shuttles</i>
are used to move platters between locations.<br /> …<br /> A read rack
contains multiple read drives. Each read drive is independent and has
slots into which platters are inserted and removed. The number of
shuttles active on a panel is limited to twice the number of read drives
in the panel. The write drive is full-rack-sized and writes multiple
platters concurrently.

Their performance evaluation focuses on the ability to respond to read

drive up the demand for femtosecond lasers, commoditizing the
technology.
</blockquote>
</div>
I’m skeptical of “commoditizing the technology”. Archival systems are a
niche in the IT market, and one on which companies are loath to spend
money. Realistically, there aren’t going to be a vast number of Silica
write heads. The only customers for systems like Silica are the large
cloud providers, who will be reluctant to commit their archives to
technology owned by a competitor. Unless a mass-market application for
femtosecond lasers emerges, the scope for cost reduction is
limited.<br /> <br /> But the more I think about this technology, which
is still in the lab, the more I think it probably has the best chance of
impacting the market among all the rival archival storage technologies.
Not great, but better than its competitors:<br />
<ul>
<li>
The media is very cheap and very dense, so the effect of Kryder’s Law
economics driving media replacement and thus its economic rather than
technical lifetime is minimal.
</li>
<li>
The media is quasi-immortal and survives benign neglect, so opex once
written is minimal.
</li>
<li>
The media is write-once, and the write and read heads are physically
separate, so the data cannot be encrypted or erased by malware. The long
read latency makes exfiltrating large amounts of data hard.
</li>
<li>
The robotics are simple and highly redundant. Any of the shuttles can
reach any of the platters. They should be much less troublesome than
tape library robotics because, unlike tape, a robot failure only renders
a small fraction of the library inaccessible and is easily repaired.
</li>
<li>
All the technologies needed are in the market now, the only
breakthroughs needed are economic, not technological.
</li>
<li>
The team has worked on improving the write bandwidth which is a critical
issue for archival storage at scale. They can currently write hundreds
of megabytes a second.
</li>
<li>
Like
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/09/more-on-facebooks-cold-storage.html">Facebook’s
archival storage technologies</a>, Project Silica enjoys the synergies
of data center scale without needing full data center environmental and

The expensive part of the system is the write head. It is an entire rack

The Svalbard archipelago is where I spent the summer of 1969 doing a
geological survey.<br /> <br /> The most important part of an archiving
strategy is knowing how you will get stuff out of the archive. Putting
stuff in and keeping it safe are important and relatively easy, but if
you can’t get stuff out when you need it what’s the point?<br /> <br />
In some cases access is only needed to a small proportion of the
archive. At Facebook, Patiejunas expected that the major reason for
access would be to respond to a subpoena. In other cases, such as
migrating to a new archival system, bulk data retrieval is
required.<br /> <br /> But if the reason for needing access is disaster
recovery it is important to have a vision of what resources are likley
to be available after the disaster. Microsoft gained a lot of
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-11-13/microsoft-apocalypse-proofs-open-source-code-in-an-arctic-cave">valuable
PR</a> by encoding much of the world’s open source software in QR codes
on film and storing the cans of film in an abandoned coal mine in
Svalbard so it would “survive the apocalypse”. In
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2019/11/seeds-or-code.html"><i>Seeds Or
Code?</i></a> I had a lot of fun imagining how the survivors of the
apocalypse would be able to access the archive.<br /> <br />

To make a long story short, after even a mild apocalypse, they wouldn’t
be able to. Let’s just point out that the first steps after the
apocalypse are getting to Svalbard. They won’t be able to fly to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svalbard_Airport">LYR</a>. As the
crow flies, the voyage from Tromsø is 591 miles across very stormy seas.
It takes several days, and getting to Tromsø won’t be easy either.<br />

Archival Storage Services
</h2>
Because technologies have very strong economies of scale, the economics
of most forms of IT work in favor of the hyper-scalers. These forces are
especially strong for archival data, both because it is almost pure cost
with no income, and because as I discussed earlier the economics of
archival storage only work at data-center scale. It will be the rare
institution that can avoid using cloud archival storage. I analyzed the
way these economic forces operate in 2019’s
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2019/02/cloud-for-preservation.html"><i>Cloud
For Preservation</i></a>:<br />
<div
style="background-color: #fff8c6; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 8px; padding-left: 8px; padding-right: 8px; padding-top: 8px; padding: 8px;">
<blockquote>
Much of the attraction of cloud technology for organizations, especially
public institutions funded through a government’s annual budget process,
is that they transfer costs from capital to operational expenditure. It
is easy to believe that this increases financial flexibility. As regards
ingest and dissemination, this may be true. Ingesting some items can be
delayed to the next budget cycle, or the access rate limit lowered
temporarily. But as regards preservation, it isn’t true. It is unlikely
that parts of the institution’s collection can be de-accessioned in a
budget crunch, only to be re-accessioned later when funds are adequate.
Even were the content still available to be re-ingested, the cost of
ingest is a significant fraction of the total life-cycle cost of
preserving digital content.
</blockquote>
</div>
Cloud services typically charge differently for ingest, storage and
retrieval. The service’s goal in designing their pricing structure is to
create lock-in, by analogy with the drug-dealer’s algorithm “the first
one’s free”. In 2019 I used the published rates to compute the cost of
ingesting in a month, storing for a year, and retrieving in a month a
petabyte using the archive services of the three main cloud providers.
Here is that table, with the costs adjusted for inflation to 2024 using
the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm">Bureau
of Labor Statistics’ calculator</a>:<br />

The “Lock-in” column is the approximate number of months of storage cost
that getting the Petabyte out in a month represents. Note that:<br />
<ul>
<li>
In all cases getting data out is much more expensive than putting it in.
</li>
<li>
The lower cost of archival storage compared to the same service’s
near-line storage is purchased at the expense of a much stronger
lock-in.
</li>
<li>
Since the whole point of archival storage is keeping data for the long
term, the service will earn much more in storage charges over the longer
life of archival data than the shorter life of near-line data.
</li>
</ul>
There may well be reasons why retrieving data from archival storage is
expensive. Most storage technologies have unified read/write heads, so
retrieval competes with ingest which, as Patiejunas figured out, is the
critical performance parameter for archival storage. This is because, to
minimize cost, archival systems are designed assuming bulk retrieval is
rare. When it happens, whether from a user request or to migrate data to
new media, it is disruptive. For example, emptying a base model TS4300
occupies it for more than a week.<br /> <br /> Six years later, things
have changed significantly. Here is the current version of the archival
services table:<br />

Points to note:<br />
<ul>
<li>
Glacier is the only one of the three that is significantly cheaper in
real terms than it was 6 years ago.
</li>
<li>
Glacier can do this because Kryder’s Law has made their storage about a
factor of about 6 cheaper in real terms in six years, or about a 35%
Kryder rate. This is somewhat faster than the rate of areal density
increase of tape, and much faster than that of disk. The guess is that
Glacier Deep Archive is on tape.
</li>
<li>
Google’s pricing indicates they aren’t serious about the archival
market.
</li>
<li>
Archive services now have differentiated tiers of service. This table
uses S3 Deep Archive, Google Archive and Microsoft Archive.
</li>
<li>
Lock-in has increased from 13.8/12.0/8.1 to 50/175/20. It is also
increased by additional charges for data lifetimes less than a
threshold, 180/365/180 days. So my cost estimate for Google is too low,
because the data would suffer these charges. But accounting for this
would skew the comparison.
</li>
<li>
Bandwidth charges are a big factor in lock-in. For Amazon they are 77%,
for Google they are 38%, for Microsoft they are 32%. Amazon’s marketing
is smart, hoping you won’t notice the outbound bandwidth charges.
</li>
</ul>
Looking at these numbers it is hard to see how anyone can justify any
archive storage other than S3 Deep Archive. It is the only one
delivering Kryder’s Law to the customer, and as my
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2017/08/economic-model-of-long-term-storage.html">economic
model</a> shows, delivering Kryder’s Law is essential to affordable
long-term storage. A petabyte for a decade costs under $120K before
taking Kryder’s Law into account and you can get it all out for under
$50K.<br />

The fundamental idea behind LOCKSS was that, given a limited budget and
a realistic range of threats, data would survive better in many cheap,
unreliable, loosely-coupled replicas than in a single expensive, durable
one.<br /> <br />

<blockquote>
Replacing one drive takes about 15 minutes of work. If we have 30,000
drives and 2 percent fail, it takes 150 hours to replace those. In other
words, one employee for one month of 8 hour days. Getting the failure
rate down to 1 percent means you save 2 weeks of employee salary - maybe
$5,000 total? The 30,000 drives costs you $4m.<br /> <br /> The $5k/$4m
means the Hitachis are worth 1/10th of 1 per cent higher cost to us.
ACTUALLY we pay even more than that for them, but not more than a few
dollars per drive (maybe 2 or 3 percent more).<br /> <br /> Moral of the
story: design for failure and buy the cheapest components you can. :-)

the reliability is only worth 1/10th of 1 percent cost increase”</a>.

<h2 id="backing-the-backslash">Backing the backslash</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-14, from: Shady Characters blog</p>
<p>
I’m almost ashamed to say it, but I never really gave the backslash a
second thought.
</p>
<p>
The backslash’s forward-leaning counterpart is everywhere, especially in
computing. It lives in network and web addresses such as
<tt>https://shadycharacters.co.uk</tt>; in file paths, such as
<tt>/home/keith</tt>; and it introduces human-readable “comments” in any
number of programming languages, often like <tt>/* this */</tt> or
<tt>// this</tt>.

Back then—and even up until recently—using WiFi 6E or WiFi 7 on a

<p>Saw an
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6h6QGVfrgQ">interview</a> with
Mark Cuban where they asked why would Elon Musk do something that would
cause Tesla stock to tank. He’s got the power to play with the biggest
financial thing that has ever existed, and quite possibly that ever will
exist. In comparison Tesla is just one car company, with a lot of
competition, a market-leading product for sure, but the competition is
catching up. They’re constantly lowering prices to keep the volume up,
so eventually the stock will have to come down anyway. He certainly
knows stuff about the company that no one else can see, maybe their new
product pipeline is empty? He also has had to deal with short-sellers
who have the incentive to drive the price down, and he can’t bet
alongside them (how would that look, a CEO betting against his own
company). No matter what, there is nothing bigger than the USA, and he’s
got it, and plans to keep it. But he’s human, and thus has frailties,
and he loses as often as he wins and knows it. Unfortunately for us
we’re all in his boat now, unless somehow we can wrench it back.</p>

further from getting where we must go. We have to reconcile, we share a

<h2 id="its-the-people-stupid">“It’s the people, stupid!”</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-14, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I keep hearing pundits and incumbent Democrats missing the point, that
the people are the ones whose opinion matters about the Republicans
dismantling our democracy in the United States.
</p>
<p>
I want to celebrate those leaders who totally get that the power is with
the people, notably Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders. They
are an inspiration! I live in New York and while AOC doesn’t represent
me in Congress
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Ryan_(politician)">Pat
Ryan</a> is my rep), in a political and spiritual way she most
definitely represents me. She should be the next president, as far as
I’m concerned. She has all the leadership abilities we could ever want.
</p>
<p>
My contribution for today is the slogan that’s the title of this piece.
It’s derived from James Carville’s
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_the_economy,_stupid">slogan</a>
when Bill Clinton was running for president in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_United_States_presidential_election">1992</a>,
updated for 2025.
</p>
<p>
“It’s the people, dummy!” was always the right slogan. It’s we, the
people, who created this country, and we the people are the only ones
who can make it work again.

the internet automatically. This high severity security flaw (tracked as
<a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2023-1389">CVE-2023-1389</a>)
has also been used to spread other malware families as far back as April
2023 when it was used in the
<a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/android-adb-matryosh-botnet">Mirai
botnet</a> malware attacks. The flaw also linked to the Condi and
AndroxGh0st malware attacks.
</p>
<p>
[…]
</p>
<p>
Of the thousands of infected devices, the majority of them are
concentrated in Brazil, Poland, the United Kingdom, Bulgaria and Turkey;
with the botnet targeting manufacturing, medical/healthcare, services
and technology organizations in the United States, Australia, China and
Mexico…

<p>
If you accept trans people being defined by their reproductive role…<br>
Then men can define all woman by their reproductive role
</p>
<p>
If you accept that trans teenagers are too young to make decisions about
their bodies…<br> Then men can decide teenage girls are too young to
make decisions about their bodies
</p>
<p>
If you accept medical gatekeeping of trans people’s access to
hormones…<br> Then doctors can restrict any woman’s access to HRT and
birth control
</p>
<p>
If you accept stripping trans people of legal protections…<br> Then men
can strip women of legal protections
</p>
<p>
This is the truth of “trans rights are human rights”.<br> Regardless of
your personal feelings on whether trans people are “really” the gender
they say they are, the exact same human rights protecting us also
underlie women’s liberation– bodily autonomy, dignity, equality of
opportunity, and protection from harm.<br> And so many men are desperate
for those rights to disappear.

The Lemkin Institute for Genocide Prevention and Human Security condemns
the anti-trans agenda of the second Trump Administration and warns
Americans that the recent spate of executive orders, which are in line
with a genocidal process against the transgender community that has been
emerging in the United States for over a decade, are meant to pave the
way for greater state repression against all individuals and other
groups in the future. It is important to consistently and loudly reject
this administration’s efforts to isolate any people or groups due to
their identities, to reaffirm the USA’s commitment to individual rights
and diversity, and to push back against efforts to normalize state
repression and violence. The time is now. –

</h1>
<p>
I stumbled upon a discussion about the Gnome Calculator. Apparently it
stopped working for some people because a bank blocked it from
retrieving the exchange rates it needs to allow users to do currency
conversions. I get it. It’s a feature, it needs data that’s up to date,
so you need to fetch it. The default is to do this once a week, I hear.
</p>
<p>
Based on
<a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-calculator/-/blob/main/lib/currency-provider.vala">currency-provider.vala</a>,
the currency providers are the
<a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/fin/data/rms_five.aspx">International
Monetary Fund</a> (IMF) and the
<a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/eurofxref/eurofxref-daily.xml">European
Central Bank</a>.
</p>
<p>
So that leads me to another question: What do you use to do calculations
you can’t do in your head?
</p>
<p>
I mostly do it in Emacs using <code>M-x calc</code>. It uses the
reverse-polish notation (RPN) I am used to from my old calculators
before there where smartphones. For a while I used <code>bc</code> but
the precision was weird. Then I tried <code>dc</code> but it was weird,
too. Now I have Super+C bound to <code>orpie</code> running in a
terminal. Perhaps I should bind that key to run <code>emacsclient</code>
and eval <code>(calc)</code>. 😂
</p>
<p>
From the replies, I found a large number of people reporting that they
used the interpreters of their favourite programming languages. I didn’t
know that this was so wide-spread. People named Python, Ruby, Fennel,
Scheme.
</p>
<p>
Python:
</p>
<pre><code>Python 3.11.2 (main, Nov 30 2024, 21:22:50) [GCC 12.2.0] on linux

<p>
<a class="account" href="https://nrw.social/@HaraldKi" title="@HaraldKi@nrw.social"><span
class="citation" data-cites="HaraldKi">@HaraldKi</span></a> shared that
they use a shell, but not just any shell: <code>tclsh</code> with the
<a href="https://www.tcl-lang.org/man/tcl8.4/TclCmd/expr.htm">expr</a>
built-in command.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Tclsh uses just double math, afair, and understands plain and simple
everyday expressions you basically learned in primary school. Plus
scientific notation like 2.7e22 . Plus a chunk of log, sin, cos, tan if
really needed. So no brain tweaks needed. The only thing to keep in
mind: add .0 to most numbers to not accidentally get ¾ -&gt; 0.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The key is have a function in your shell that gets transformed into a
Tcl command that is piped to <code>tclsh</code>. In my case, using
<code>fish</code>, use <code>funced calc –save</code> and use the
following:
</p>
<pre><code>function calc
  echo &quot;puts [expr {$args}]&quot; | tclsh
end
</code></pre>
<p>
At the shell prompt:
</p>
<pre><code>&gt; calc 1+2+3
6
&gt; calc 4/3
1
&gt; calc 4/3.0
1.3333333333333333
</code></pre>
<p>
What about the other options?
</p>
<p>
I think the key is that they have to startup fast and be ready to type.
<code>bc</code> certainly qualifies. Just remember to set the scale! Or
use the <code>–mathlib</code> option.
</p>
<pre><code>bc 1.07.1

</code></pre>
<p>
<code>dc</code> has reverse-polish notation (RPN) but is very terse.
Tokens are separated by spaces or newlines. Thus, the Enter key doesn’t
print a result. You need to use the <code>p</code> command. Again, the
default is integer math. Use the <code>k</code> command to switch scale.
</p>
<pre><code>1 2 3 + + p
6
4 3 / p

</code></pre>
<p>
A weird part is that you need to enter negative numbers using the
underscore (<code>_3</code> for -3).
</p>
<p>
By contrast, my favourite calculator in the terminal right now is
<code>orpie</code>. You get reverse-polish notation and immediate
feedback.

<p>
Emacs comes with <code>M-x quick-calc</code> which simply asks for an
expression and prints the result:
</p>
<pre><code>Result: 1 + 2 + 3 =&gt;  6  (16#6, 8#6, 2#110, &quot;^F&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>
Then there’s <code>M-x calculator</code> which comes with its own mode.
You can use <code>o h</code> to switch output to hex, for example. So
adding up 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 results in 10, or A in hex.
</p>
<pre><code>Calc==H&gt; A
</code></pre>
<p>
And finally there is <code>M-x calc</code>. Check out the
<a href="https://github.com/ahyatt/emacs-calc-tutorials/blob/master/README.org">short
tutorials</a> by Andrew Hyatt, if you’re interested in learning more. As
I said above, this is my default solution. <code>1 RET 2 RET 3 RET +
+</code> and there we go. Plus a trail over on the right in case you’re
confused.

Copying the result runs into a tiny problem, for me: The stack depth is
copied along with it! So if you copy the above result (6), what you
actually get is <code>1: 6</code>. Which is never what I want to paste
elsewhere. Never.

<p>
Apparently it gets the exchange rates from the European Central Bank and

Another option is spreadsheets, of course.

There is <code>sc</code>, of course. If you don’t want to hit
<code>=</code> for every number you enter, use <code>-n</code> for
“quick numeric entry”. I’m not sure how I can quickly select the range
for something like <code><span class="citation"
data-cites="sum">@sum</span>(A0:A2)</code> but it certainly seems
possible to use <code>sc</code> for interesting stuff.

<p>John Gruber is not mincing his words. What Apple showed regarding the
upcoming “personalized Siri” at WWDC was not a demo. It was a concept
video. Concept videos are bullshit, and a sign of a company in disarray,
if not crisis. The Apple that commissioned the futuristic “Knowledge
Navigator” concept video in 1987 was the …</p>

<h2 id="the-writers-web">The writer’s web</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-13, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
The web was initially
<a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1866.txt">designed</a> for writers.
Styling, links, paragraphs, titles (at all levels). The ability to edit.
No character limits. That’s what we had to work with when we started
blogging in the mid-late 90s.
</p>
<p>
Then there was a big
<a href="http://scripting.com/2016/09/22/tenYearsUsingTwitter.html">corner-turn</a>
in 2006. In an instant the web shrunk to almost nothing. No titles, no
style, no links, 140 chars max. Enough to say “I’m waiting in line at
the bank.” Nothing wrong with that, but it isn’t what I think of as
writing.
</p>
<p>
A couple of years ago, I decided to focus on writers once again. I
started developing ideas of what <b>the writer’s web</b> would look like
if we used today’s technology. And here are the three main directions.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>New technology</b>. Since the last time we looked, Markdown was
invented. RSS feeds had become instant. Websockets replaced long
polling. Servers got cheap! And SQL is fast and the tools are much
better. We’ll use all the best new technology.
</li>
<li>
<b>Modern interfaces</b>. We’ll borrow the best ideas from twitter-like
systems. Writing a new post should be as easy as writing a tweet, but
with all the features writers need at-hand, easy to access.
</li>
<li>
<b>Open, for real</b>. And best of all, it’ll be open, for real, now –
not some day. Each component will be completely replaceable with simple
APIs, and lots of example code.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I’m going to use WordPress as my basic back-end technology because it is
reliable and broadly deployed, but you don’t have to. The great thing
about the web is that it’s already federated. Nothing to wait for. <span
class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>
</p>
<p>
We know how to do this. The only question is whether we <i>choose</i>
to.
</p>
<p>
Best way to get started – write a blog post about what the writer’s web
means to you. Send me a link. I’ll read it.

Yorker Radio Hour</a> interview with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Kotkin">Stephen
Kotkin</a> of Stanford. He’s an expert on Russian history, biographer of
Stalin, he talks about what Trump is doing, and as I listened I realized
we have not filled in how crazy or challenged the leaders of the other
huge powers are. Trump apparently is not an outlier. Putin can’t keep
the war going in Europe indefinitely, their banking system is running on
fumes and the people are tired of war (unlike in the US they feel their
wars). There’s tremendous corruption in the Chinese military, so Xi
isn’t rushing to try to take over Taiwan. It’s easier and safer to just
keep threatening. In the US we’re shocked by what we’ve become, so
quickly, we’re failing to see the context. Kotkin also offers a
perspective on the new media, relative to when TV and radio were new,
and all the chaos the US has survived. He said something I believe is
true, it’ll be hard to turn America into a totalitarian state because
every freaking American today was raised in a country where we had all
the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_amendments_to_the_Constitution_of_the_United_States">amendments</a>.
It’ll be hard to get us to STFU. They have a plan in TrumpLand, but that
doesn’t mean it will work.</p>

id="fun-with-the-sharp-zaurus-sl-5500-and-an-unexpected-openbsd-link">Fun
with the Sharp Zaurus SL-5500 (and an unexpected OpenBSD link)</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-12, from: Liam on Linux</p>
The
<a href="https://medium.com/@alabbe/sharp-zaurus-sl-5500-collie-8254d03964d6">Zaurus
SL-5500</a> was an early, tiny, Linux pocket computer-cum-PDA. I had
one. Two, in fact. They got stolen from my house. :-(<br />
<p>
It had a CF card slot, so you could even remove your storage card and
insert a CF Wifi card instead, and have mobile Internet in your pocket,
20 years ago!  <br /><br />But if you did, you got a free extra with a
wifi adaptor – a battery life of about 15-20 minutes.
</p>
<p>
It was clever, but totally useless. With the wifi card in, you couldn’t
have external storage any more, so there was very little room left.
</p>
<p>
I had to check:
<a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/first-looks/30821/sharp-zaurus-sl-5500" rel="ugc">https://uk.pcmag.com/first-looks/30821/sharp-zaurus-sl-5500</a>
</p>
<p>
64MB RAM, 16MB flash, and a 320x240 screen. Or rather 240x320 as it was
portrait.
</p>
<p>
The sheer amount of thought and planning that went into the Linux-based
Zaurus was shown by the fact that the tiny physical keyboard <em>had no
pipe symbol.</em> Bit of a snag on an xNix machine, that.
</p>
<p>
Both mine were 2nd hand, given to me by techie mates who’d played with
them and got bored and moved on.
<a href="https://lobste.rs/s/okqjn5/20_years_linux_on_desktop_part_3">I’m
told others got better battery</a> life on Wifi. Maybe their tiny
batteries were already on the way out or something.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Fun side-note #1:</strong> I do not remember the battery pack
looking like this one, though. I feel sure I would have noticed.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Battery-Zaurus-SL-5500-900mAh-Li-ion/dp/B007K0DRIU" rel="ugc">https://www.amazon.co.uk/Battery-Zaurus-SL-5500-900mAh-Li-ion/dp/B007K0DRIU</a>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Fun side-note #2:</strong> both came with Sharp’s original OS,
version 1.0. I had an interesting time experimenting with alternative OS
builds, new ROMs etc. Things did get a lot better, or at least less bad,
after the first release. But the friend who gave me my first unit swore
up and down that he’d update the ROM. I can’t see any possible mechanism
for flash memory to just revert to earlier contents on its own, though.
</p>
<p>
With replacement OS images you had to decide how to partition the
device’s tiny amount of storage: some as read-only for the OS, some as
read-write, some as swap, etc. The allocations were fixed and if you got
it wrong you had to nuke and reload.
</p>
<p>
This would have been <em>much</em> easier if the device had some form of
logical volume management, and dynamically-changeable volume sizes.
</p>
<p>
Which is a thought I also had repeatedly around 2023-2024 when
experimenting with OpenBSD. It uses an exceptionally complex
partitioning layout, and if you forcibly simplify it, you (1) run up
against the limitations of its horribly primitive partitioning tool and
(2) reduce the OS’s security.
</p>
<p>
I have got just barely competent enough with OpenBSD that between
<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/04/22/openbsd_71_released_including_apple/" rel="ugc">writing
this</a> in early 2022 and
<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/10/10/version_76_openbsd_of_theseus/" rel="ugc">writing
this</a> in late 2024, two and a half years later, I went from
“struggling mightily just to get it running at all in a VM” to “able
with only some whimpering and cursing to get it dual-booting on bare
metal with XP64, NetBSD, and 2 Linux distros.”
</p>
<p>
But it’s still a horrible <em>horrible</em> experience and some form of
LVM would make matters massively easier.
</p>
<p>
Which is odd because I avoid Linux LVM as much as possible. I find it a
massive pain when you don’t need it. However, you need it for Linux
full-disk encryption, and one previous employer of mine insisted upon
that.
</p>
<p>
In other words: I really dislike LVM, and I am annoyed by Linux
gratuitously insisting on it in situations where it should not strictly
speaking be needed – but in other OSes and other situations, I have
really wanted it, but it wasn’t available.

Historically, China, Russia, Iran &amp; North Korea have cooperated to

language, culture, politics &amp; technological sophistication have
hindered deeper collaboration, including in cyber. Shifting geopolitical
dynamics, however, could drive these states toward a more formalized
intell-sharing partnership. Such a “Four Eyes” alliance would be
motivated by common adversaries and strategic interests, including an
enhanced capacity to resist economic sanctions and support proxy

<p>
New computer arrived today! It’s replacing my 2020 Intel MacBook Air,
which will be passed on as a hand-me-down to my mum, because her 2012
Dell is on its last legs and she needs an upgrade 😂
</p>
<p>
I thought about using Migration Assistant to transfer stuff across but
then I thought about how much cruft I’ve probably built up and went,
“No, I want to transfer stuff manually so I can be more purposeful about
what I have and where I have it!” The downside is, now I have to
actually make those decisions about what apps to reinstall and how to
organise my files 😒 I feel like I need a checklist.

The US Department of Justice on Wednesday

the indictment of 12 Chinese individuals accused of more than a decade
of hacker intrusions around the world, including eight staffers for the
contractor i-Soon, two officials at China’s Ministry of Public Security
who allegedly worked with them, and two other alleged hackers who are
said to be part of the Chinese hacker group APT27, or Silk Typhoon,
which prosecutors say was involved in the US Treasury breach late last
year.

According to prosecutors, the group as a whole has targeted US state and
federal agencies, foreign ministries of countries across Asia, Chinese
dissidents, US-based media outlets that have criticized the Chinese
government, and most recently the US Treasury, which was breached
between September and December of last year. An internal Treasury report

<h2 id="bluesky-is-not-billionaire-proof">Bluesky is not
billionaire-proof</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-11, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
First I want to say that
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=bluesky">Bluesky</a> is
nice software, good design, attractive, they have a goal and stick to
it, and it stays up, no
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/01/the-story-behind-twitters-fail-whale/384313/?gift=f35zZN0v_gDFE8xNwlQAHSNkdwehtNpsP-bh1d4EoU4&utm_source=copy-link&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=share">fail
whales</a> that were so vexing of early days Twitter.
</p>
<p>
That said, I have two criticisms:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
They are implementing the same limits that Twitter designed into their
product, no styling, no links, you can’t edit, no titles, enclosures,
and a limit of 300 chars per post. Simple stuff that, if they broke
through the Twitter design, would make it a decent platform for writers.
I don’t see any reason to duplicate the mistakes that Twitter made, in
2006, in the design of their product.
</li>
<li>
They repeatedly claim to be
<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/21/bluesky-ceo-jay-graber-says-x-rival-is-billionaire-proof.html">billionaire-proof</a>
but as far as I can tell, and I have built software on their APIs, they
are not. Yet they tell users they are safe, and what choice do the users
have but to believe them, esp when tech journalism repeats the claims
without challenging them. As a result, people believe that if Bluesky
were to be acquired by a billionaire, something they might not even be
able to stop, they will be able to quickly migrate to something that’s
the same as Bluesky and keep all their connections, people they follow
and people following them.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
All of this would be nice, if it were true but imho it is not true. I’m
going to go through the recent statement from their CEO in the remainder
of this piece. I invite them to rebut it, esp
<a href="https://www.techdirt.com/user/mmasnick/">Mike Masnick</a> of
Techdirt, who has journalistic integrity, is widely respected, and is on
the Bluesky board of directors. Honestly I can’t understand why Masnick
puts his integrity on the line here, I’ve tried to discuss it with him,
and I guess he doesn’t take me seriously enough to give a serious
response. I would also like to know what his deal is with them, does he
profit personally if Bluesky is acquired. That needs to be disclosed,
imho. I would do it if I were in his shoes.
</p>
<p>
If you read my blog, I hope you know that I wouldn’t challenge something
like this unless I was pretty sure there is an issue. I don’t imagine
for a second that people would abandon Bluesky if they knew they were
locked in and would have no path out if it was bought by a billionaire.
I know we can’t get out and I still use Bluesky, because that’s where
the people I want to network with are. They won. So they don’t have to
deceive. They can stop making this claim. Yet they continue to do it, in
pretty much exactly the same terms as they have been doing it all along.
</p>
<p>
Here’s the statement that appeared in
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/10/at-sxsw-bluesky-ceo-jay-graber-pokes-fun-at-mark-zuckerberg-with-latin-phrase-t-shirt/">TechCrunch</a>

“If a billionaire came in and bought Bluesky, or took it over, or if I
decided tomorrow to change things in a way that people really didn’t
like, then they could fork off and go on to another application,” Graber
explained at SXSW. “There’s already applications in the network that
give you another way to view the network, or you could build a new one
as well. And so that openness guarantees that there’s always the ability
to move to a new alternative.”
</li>
<li>
The quote is from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Graber">Jay
Graber</a>, the CEO of the company.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Let’s go through it, point by point
</p>
<ul>
<li>
“they could fork it off and go on to another application” – in this
sentence “they” applies to developers, because you have to be a
developer to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)">fork</a>
an application. Assuming Bluesky is available in source code, with an
appropriate open source license, and they have released enough code so
that a developer could quickly launch an exact Bluesky clone, maybe this
part is true. I can’t evaluate it without going through the exercise of
forking their code, but I do know this – no one has. Why not? I would
think that with <a href="https://backlinko.com/bluesky-statistics">27
million users</a>, by now someone would have tried it. Maybe this post
will uncover such an instance, or motivate one. I would be happy to try
it out to see how it works. But it has to be completely independent of
Bluesky. It would have to work, without loss of functionality, if
Bluesky’s network disappeared.
</li>
<li>
“there’s already applications in the network that give you another way
to view the network” – this is true. But they don’t do very much nor do
they have many users. They are basically experiments that show that you
could build something else with the format they have defined. This isn’t
unusual. You can make a lot of different kinds of websites with HTML,
for example, but very few of them have millions of users. Same thing
with apps built on the Bluesky protocol that use data types that Bluesky
itself doesn’t understand. I don’t think this adds anything to the claim
of billionaire-safety. Also if these apps are in the same network, that
doesn’t give us any independence from Bluesky. So I think this is a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOP_(code)">no-op</a>, it adds
nothing but confusion to the claim.
</li>
<li>
“[our] openness guarantees that there’s always the ability to move to a
new alternative” – this is not true, and it’s the crux of the concern.
There is no such guarantee. If there were, we would be able to move to
an alternative now. Where is it? It’s not there and imho it can’t be
there.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are other problems. Mastodon, via its API, actually does what
Bluesky claims to do. There are lots of
<a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-server-instance">instances</a>
of Mastodon servers and they interop with each other. It’s an incredible
proof of concept. But its federation ability adds enough complexity that
most people prefer Bluesky, which doesn’t have those complications.
There are always tradeoffs in technology. You can have flexibility but
it comes at a price. Bluesky would have you believe you can have the
flexibility of Mastodon without paying the price.
</p>
<p>
There may be a way to do what they promise, but it would mean removing
features, which isn’t a bad idea, but they have decided they have to do
everything Twitter does and there is the conundrum. Twitter was designed
around centralization, and because of that Twitter is <i>not</i>
billionaire-proof as has been
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk#Business_career">demonstrated</a>,
and neither is Bluesky.
</p>
<p>
Every time I read this quote from their CEO it gets my bile up, and I
say things <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com">on
Bluesky</a> that I regret later. Instead I decided to take the time this
morning to carefully explain the problem and now when they make the
claim, I can point to this piece. And maybe I’m wrong, and they can show
me an instance I can switch to and not lose access to my network of
friends on Bluesky and not depend on the existence of Bluesky itself.
That would actually make me happy (I think) and give me a completely new
understanding of computer science.

2025-03-09 The looming Discord IPO
</h1>
<p>
So… Discord might be going there. I like their offering. I even pay them
about $10/month. What they offer works well. People get their own little
communities to administer, with the tools to administer them well, with
the self-written automations and bots to handle communities from a
handful of people to many thousands. Read
<a class="account" href="https://infosec.exchange/@isotopp" title="@isotopp@infosec.exchange"><span

<a href="https://infosec.exchange/@isotopp/114116202418228034">perspective
on Discord</a>.
</p>
<p>
But the monetization drive is strong. And once the shareholders are in
place, pressure for monetization will ramp up even more, I’m sure. How
long until it all goes down? Five years?
</p>
<p>
What are your backup plans?
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://campaignwiki.org/wiki/Chat">My backup plan</a> is an
IRC backend (<a href="https://ngircd.barton.de/">ngircd</a> uses about
5M of memory) and two instances of a web front-end called
<a href="https://thelounge.chat/">The Lounge</a>. One of them is free
for all and connects to my chat server; the other needs registration and
offers file uploads and always-on connectivity (it acts as a “bouncer”).
The two of them take about 150M of memory. Each registered account gets
a little SQLite file with the logs. No other resources required.
</p>
<p>
You can connect to the IRC backend directly using your favourite IRC
client, of course. Emacs comes with two of them. Just saying. 😄
</p>
<p>
For iOS, there’s <a href="https://colloquy.app/">Colloquy</a>.
</p>
<p>
For Android,
<a class="account" href="https://tabletop.social/@wandererbill" title="@wandererbill@tabletop.social"><span
class="citation" data-cites="wandererbill">@wandererbill</span></a>
suggests <a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/io.mrarm.irc/">Revolution
IRC</a>.
</p>
<p>
<a class="account" href="https://tabletop.social/@phf" title="@phf@tabletop.social"><span
class="citation" data-cites="phf">@phf</span></a> suggested
<a href="https://snikket.org/service/quickstart/">Snikket</a> instead.
Installation requires a Docker image.
</p>
<p>
I dislike Docker, not because of what it is but because of what it
implies. A virtual machine inside your virtual machine means that it
doesn’t auto-update. Upgrading will be tricky. It also means individual
deployment requires multiple services such that it ended up being easier
for them to supply a Docker image instead of supplying good
instructions. I always take that to mean that the setup is brittle and
underdocumented. Perhaps I’m wrong but it that’s the suspicion I have.
</p>
<p>
Generally speaking, I dislike Docker images for my virtual server server
(6G memory, 75g storage, 2 cores) because multiple services packaged in
a dockerfile usually mean lots of resources required. Frugal computing
means that I am loath to accommodate that. I prefer not to upgrade my
virtual machine.

had Discord-like roles and role management for the server owner to hand
out, so perhaps it’s quite a suitable replacement. Revolt can be
self-hosted via Docker or self-building. At least there is a lot of info

wanted to give Matrix another spin. There are two server
implementations, Synapse and Dendrite.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
At an absolute minimum, Dendrite will expect 1GB RAM. For a comfortable
day-to-day deployment which can participate in federated rooms for a
number of local users, be prepared to assign 2-4 CPU cores and 8GB RAM —
more if your user count increases. –

years ago. It worked well! But it also took a lot of resource. During
the video call, the virtual machine’s

sometimes use the installation at the
<a href="https://ffmuc.net/">Freifunk München</a> for gaming. Thanks,
ffmuc! 😍
</p>
<p>
So, where does that leave is? I don’t know. People don’t seem to like
The Lounge with IRC backend and I seem to be unwilling to upgrade my
hosting commitments.
</p>
<p>
<a class="account" href="https://hackers.town/@mc" title="@mc@hackers.town"><span

different IRC server called <a href="https://ergo.chat/about">Ergo</a>

wrote in with some interesting feedback. The Zulip part is interesting
because I only used it for tiny bit, talking to the maintainers of
Antora. Here’s what they have to say:
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
Zulip is great for UI, slightly aggravating to run. It absolutely wants
a dedicated server. It has a dice roller as one of the sample bots, and
the API is extensive.
</li>
<li>
IRC is extremely easy to setup and relatively easy to write bots for.
Interfaces vary from bare bones to not-bad; The Lounge is up on the
not-bad end, and also easy to host.
</li>
<li>
Matrix may be the future of federated chat systems, but if you don’t
need federation, the complexity and ongoing maintenance are not worth
it.
</li>
<li>
Jitsi has integrated chat but is video-conferencing-centric; the text
chat is actually Prosody (an XMPP/Jabber) server under the hood. Video
processing takes up a lot of CPU and bouncing it around takes a lot of
bandwidth; otherwise, it’s pretty nice.
</li>
<li>
I haven’t tried running Revolt but I looked at the docs and I am really
not favorably inclined. They have some questionable technology choices
and insist on a Docker-first install that in my experience is a likely
sign that there are too many moving parts for anyone to be able to
diagnose what’s going wrong.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
My suggestions would be:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
IRC is still a solid choice
</li>
<li>
Prosody without the Jitsi video conferencing is pretty nice, albeit a
little complex to configure initially.
</li>
<li>
If I felt like spending the money for a medium-large VM at a hosting
service dedicated to gaming, Zulip would be nice.
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
I didn’t know about the hosting of Zulip but the rest tracks my
experience. IRC is the simplest option.

giving <a href="https://galene.org/">Galène</a> a try. Videoconferencing
that might not be as hard to setup correctly as self-hosted Jitsi!

<p>
In the same piece:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Moreover — people should not assume that Trump’s policies are
destructive for NATO. If anything, pushing European allies to increase
defense spending is going to strengthen NATO.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Well, I’m assuming that a NATO full of bootlickers would be great for
Trump as he and Putin divvy up Europe.
</p>
<p>
I bet every European country that bough US equipment is super angry
right now.
</p>
<p>
I am super angry because Switzerland, after a long fight against the new
fighter planes, after considering Swedish and French fighter planes,
decided to go with the planes that are the most expensive, the most
unreliable (based on my uninformed opinions), and the most
untrustworthy: the F-35.
</p>
<p>
From a country that bullies its allies and betrays its friends, that
switches off the satellite phones, the intelligence sharing, and
whatever else it damn pleases in order to force a settlement. Which is
within their rights, of course. But also disqualifies them as a friend
for a generation, if you ask me.
</p>
<p>
A country with the most powerful military in the world and the wisdom of
a tooth that needs to be pulled. 🤮

<p>
And we’re not even part of NATO.

<p>
For more about the F-35,

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
With over 400 F-35s projected for Europe by 2030, per Lockheed Martin,
the jet remains a cornerstone of NATO’s air power—but its integration
highlights a paradox: its technological edge comes at the cost of
strategic vulnerability. The U.S. policy restricting independent test
operations outside CONUS, combined with reliance on U.S.-managed MDFs,
ALIS, ODIN, and software updates, amplifies fears of over-dependence. –

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
… but the problem is not technical. The problem is that in 2025 US has
rather clearly signalled that its subjectively defined “interests” will
now have priority of international agreements.
</p>
<p>
That is, the same agreements towards which the US has over the 30 years
consistently pushed all European countries, and especially the new EU
and NATO joiners. And it made sense as long as the US was the guarantor
of these treaties.
</p>
<p>
What we have now? Let’s say Russia conducts a limited military incursion
into eastern Poland with the objective of controlling the Suwalki
Corridor. This of course is in violation of UN Charter, NATO Charter and
a hundred of bilateral treaties between Russia and EU and Poland. So
what? The 2025 US president now decides a “prolonged defense” is “not in
US interests” and does everything to force “peace” on Poland.
</p>
<p>
“Everything” includes impairing US-delivered weapons systems and
generally creating a powerful impression of stab in the back.
</p>
<p>
A “peace”, in which Poland’s concession is the town of Suwałki, and
Russia’s “concession” is the nearby town of Olsztyn, which Russia
mercifully agrees not to occupy or destroy. Well, it also happens to be
a Polish town but Russia in the meantime declared it “historically
Russian region” and it now presents it as a concession.
</p>
<p>
And the 2025 US president says it’s OK, because “peace” and “both sides
did concessions”.

Recovery from DOGE is hard.
</p>
<p>
To put recovery from DOGE into perspective: In tiny Switzerland we
elected prime right-winger Blocher into government and he ran the
justice department for a handful years. And he fired a lot of people for
efficiency. And the institutions are still struggling twenty years
later. People fired find new jobs, new careers, early retirements.
People staying work hard, burn out, are angry, work on projects and
switch tracks before the projects run into walls. The institutional
memory keeps shrinking as the new recruits are younger and younger.
Suddenly the seniors have been here for just four years. It’s a
disgrace. A festering wound. All the jobs are overwhelming and people
are drained when they take these positions and they leave again or burn
out or struggle or backstab.
</p>
<p>
And of course everybody who was against the cuts isn’t automatically in
favour of increasing the budgets and raising taxes when the chainsaw
politicians are gone. But the jobs still needs to get done and so
quality goes down and waiting times increase and you can all join the
slow march of institutional death and hope for that rekindling of the
founding spirit, when having working institutions are a goal again, when
the empathy-deprived scrooges are long gone.

<p>“To truly INNOVATE, we need to take massive risks with human life,

<p>BTW it’s worth
<a href="http://scripting.com/2025/02/24/153052.html">calling
attention</a> to a bit I linked to yesterday. <i>Cross-posting to
Bluesky and Mastodon is not on the roadmap for WordLand.</i> They are
too limited in the features they support for writers. This is a big
point, not a casual thing. I am trying to create a network that’s like
stereo to mono. We’re not going to try to scale down writing in WordLand
so it fits into the tight little featureless well-silo’d boxes in order
to peer with those systems. Instead, I want to force them to give
writers a decent surface to write on. Somehow we lost our minds and
decided deliberately to limit communication to grunts and snorts, and it
should not be a surprise that when our civilization migrated to them, it
became unable to understand complex ideas. I guarantee you Carl Sagan,
if he were alive, would have seen this. Or maybe not? I don’t know. But
it’s a bizarre situation that I’ve decided to try to fix.</p>

<p>The word is starting to spread about
<a href="https://wordland.social/">WordLand</a>. And the product is
holding up pretty well. There are some issues in Safari with the toolbar
that pops up over selection. I see people pasting in URLs that makes me
think it’s not working for them. Don Park started using it. I did my
first project with Don in the late 80s. The project was very successful.
His respect means a lot to me. The positioning – it makes WordPress as
easy to write for as Twitter, is great to hear as users write about it.
That was one of the major design goals. What people are missing, and
it’s right in front of their eyes, they can use writing features that
somehow never made it to the twitter-like systems, the ones listed on
the <a href="https://textcasting.org/">textcasting memorandum</a> (or
manifesto, whichever you prefer). I’m glad people are seeing this as an
enhancement to WordPress, not an attempt to create a new community. I
want <i>all</i> WordPress writers to use this product. Every one of
them. I want people to feel that it’s an essential part of WordPress,
for writers. The writer’s web. Remember that, you’ll be hearing a lot
about that. And I want to be sure we fix all the bugs, and add all the
features they believe are missing, as long as the features pertain to
writing. Everything else is well-covered by the main product. There’s
also an API that comes with WordLand, I’ll be talking more about that
later. Makes it easier to write WordPress apps in JavaScript that run in
the browser.</p>

<p>
I’m a bit behind in my RSS feeds and I didn’t realize
<a href="https://www.susanjeanrobertson.com/writing/tag-youre-it/">Susan
tagged me</a> to answer a series of questions about my blog. I’ve read
dozens of these and to be honest was feeling a little left out, so
thanks Susan for including me! (Susan’s one of my favorite bloggers and
crafters, be sure to like and subscribe.)
</p>
<h2>
Why did you start blogging in the first place?
</h2>
<p>
I published a zine in high school with my best friend Mike. Our zine
Wimpkiller was a creative outlet for all the composition notebooks we
filled up over a bottomless cups of coffee at IHOP. We’d print out
stories on Mike’s computer, chop ’em up, glue ’em together, and then
scam copies after midnight with the help of the friendly late-shift
worker at Kinko’s. I enjoyed that thrill of self-publishing then as much
as I do now. It felt like the garage band of writing. You may not be
good or ever get famous, but you can brute force some art into the
world.
</p>
<p>
In college blogs became a trend. I created a blog as I graduated from
college to chronicle my entry into the corporate world and ended up
chronicling my move and life in Japan. It served as a form of catharsis
and outward processing as well as keeping my friends and family up to
date on my adventures. That blog died after I came back from Japan and
had to get a job and start a career.
</p>
<p>
Meeting Jeffery Zeldman at SXSW was the inspiration for this edition of
the blog, if you can believe it. A brief encounter but my key takeaway
on how I could become more like my web development heroes was to write
more. They write, and writing begets books, and books begets conference
talks. It seemed like a template I could follow and I started
self-publishing again. Over time, I wrote enough to where I got to write
on <a href="https://alistapart.com/">Jeffrey’s blog</a> and speak at his
conference a handful of times. I guess the plan worked out.
</p>
<h2>
What platform are you using to manage your blog and why did you choose
it?
</h2>
<p>
I started on WordPress but
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2012/11/brander-newer/">I moved my blog
to Jekyll in 2012</a>. I chose Jekyll because I was into Ruby at the
time and fighting with WordPress for good performance was exhausting me.
I wanted a simpler authoring and development experience. The simplicity
of building with markdown files on <code>localhost</code> still
resonates with me.
</p>
<h2>
Have you blogged on other platforms before?
</h2>
<p>
I’ve used Blogger, MovableType, WordPress, and Jekyll. There’s also an
ill-fated Eleventy branch on my site that never made it to production.
I’m sure Jekyll will implode and I’ll need to find something else, but
switching platforms would be a distraction for me at this point without
some obvious benefit or process improvement.
</p>
<h2>
How do you write your posts? For example, in a local editing tool, or in
a panel/dashboard that’s part of your blog?
</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2021/09/my-notion-blogging-kanban/">I
write my posts in a giant Notion kanban</a>. It’s overkill but it’s my
overkill. The organization capabilities and “markdown-like” aspects of
Notion made it a good fit over a folder-o’-files. Before publishing, my
posts go through a series of
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2021/10/pre-publish-blogging-rituals/">pre-publishing
rituals</a>. With those processes combined I maintain a level of quality
and throughput that I’m happy with.
</p>
<h2>
When do you feel most inspired to write?
</h2>
<p>
I find time to write after the kids go to bed. If there’s time during
the workday, I may spend a lunch break jotting some thoughts too. My
blogging is very work-dependent to the extent that sometimes
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2020/09/boredom-begets-boredom/">when
I’m productive at work, I’m most productive at blogging</a>. But often,
I’m too tired or focusing on other tasks to craft a well-reasoned blog
post.
</p>
<h2>
Do you publish immediately after writing, or do you let it simmer a bit
as a draft?
</h2>
<p>
Most of my drafts simmer for weeks if not months or years. From time to
time I’ll do a one day turnaround on a post and that’s rewarding, but
it’s inconsistent. At the time of writing I have 22 active drafts where
”active” means I’ve updated them at least once in the last six months.
If I increase the scope to one year, there’s 41 drafts in my kanban.
</p>
<h2>
What are you generally interested in writing about?
</h2>
<p>
I’m a generalist at heart and enjoy writing about technology generally.
If you look at my archive it’s pretty rare that two consecutive posts
will be thematically similar. I write about specific technologies like
CSS but also about game development or the capital-W Web. And of course
prototypes, which I’m convinced are the not-so-secret sauce for building
great technologies.
</p>
<p>
One direction I’m slipping towards in my mind is futurism and
speculative fiction
(e.g. <a href="https://daverupert.com/stories/">sci-fi</a>). Writing
about current technology limits you to existing capitalist and corporate
structures. Imagining the future
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2017/10/a-good-science-fiction-story/">and
the potential fallout</a> allows you to think without the confines of
“Good because make money” which so much of our discourse is today.
</p>
<h2>
Who are you writing for?
</h2>
<p>
Woof. Good question. 90% of the time I’m writing to get ideas out of my
head. Transfiguring ideas into text works wonders for me. I also tend to
write for an abstract audience, people who are curious about the web and
technology yet crave more from it; a person who considers themselves a
technologist, but also factors in morality and other
<a href="http://daverupert.com/2024/04/thoughts-on-cosmotechnics/">cosmotechnics</a>.
</p>
<h2>
What’s your favorite post on your blog?
</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2023/08/quick-thoughts-on-chips/">Quick
Thoughts on Chips</a> (2023) is up there but I feel like
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2013/04/responsive-deliverables/">Responsive
Deliverables</a> (2013) aka, the “tiny bootstraps” post, is a level of
quality, thoughtfulness, and timelessness that I don’t achieve often.
I’d like more “timeless” pieces like that, but I don’t exactly know how
or if it’s worth trying to bottle that magic.
</p>
<h2>
Any future plans for your blog? Maybe a redesign, a move to another
platform, or adding a new feature?
</h2>
<p>
I’m pretty comfortable with my site, but I have a couple changes in
mind:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c13gpBrnGEw&amp;t=225s">Use
named grid lines</a>
</li>
<li>
Blowout my tag pages with custom art direction
</li>
<li>
Make my mobile layout perfect
</li>
<li>
Write more <a href="https://daverupert.com/stories/">shitty sci-fi</a>
</li>
<li>
Switch from Notion to Obsidian
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Some of those will happen over the course of a year, some in the dark of
night, some never.
</p>
<h2>
Tag ’em.

<p>I love how people declare that Trump doesn’t represent us. But the
truth is as long as our representatives don’t impeach and remove him, he
absolutely does represent us. There aren’t two definitions of
<i>represent.</i></p>

very last message in the DG is</a>, now, 25 years later, basically the
design of the network I’m building – with WordLand as the frontend and
WordPress as the backend. The issue is the same. When people post only
to get attention, forget about anything useful getting done there. It’s
strictly a broadcast system. So the investment Masto and Bluesky make in
discourse is imho wasted complexity. What we want is linking, not
replies. If they were the web, they would be designed very differently.
Anyway, in 2000, I asked people to put their ideas on their own sites,
send me a link, and maybe I’ll post it on my site. That right there is
the plan for the new network. Facilitating that, it’s as easy as posting
on a twitter-like system (the early users
<a href="https://doc.searls.com/2025/03/07/first-drafting/">confirm</a>
that!), but the post goes into <i>your</i> space ie your blog, and a
link goes to the person you’re responding to, and it’s up to them
whether or not they want to amplify it, using their own criteria, in
their space, to their subscribers. It’s why twitter failed to be a keg
of revolutionary ideas, instead one of warring factions in a prison. Not
able to leave, but not able to do anything either.</p>

<p>I did a restoration of
<a href="https://discuss.userland.com/">discuss.userland.com</a>, the
discussion group for scripting.com between 1998 and 2001. I think now
finally it works. If you find anything interesting in the archive, send
me a link. A lot of the early blogs started from discussions there,
heated at times. But a lot of good stuff came from it.</p>

<h2 id="fucking-republicans-and-medicare">Fucking Republicans and
Medicare</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-09, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I am hereby changing the name of “Republicans” to “Fucking Republicans”
because that’s what they do and what we’re going to do to them. Today’s
issue is Medicare, which hits home to me, a person who planned for
health care and depends on Medicare.
</p>
<p>
I need my Medicare. It’s my health insurance. Health insurance always
been a problem for me, with pre-existing conditions, and at one point a
lapsed corporate plan.
</p>
<p>
I finally got on solid ground or so I thought when I turned 65 a few
years ago. Now I find out that the Repubs are going to cancel or reduce
my insurance, and I don’t imagine that a person my age, with my
pre-existing conditions (we all have them once at this age) I could get
insurance.
</p>
<p>
So please tell me Republicans, how this is meant to work? I am not
stupid and I know Medicare is not out of money. Am I going to be paying
out of pocket for my health care? Are there any doctors or hospitals who
even do this any longer?
</p>
<p>
Repubs, if my Medicare goes down, you are going down too.
</p>
<p>
PS: The
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLLFeZGeXbA">inspiration</a>
for this fucking idea.

<h2 id="krugmans-paywall">Krugman’s paywall</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-09, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I’m not a paid subscriber to anything on Substack. But I do read a few
of their newsletters when they come out, including
<a href="https://paulkrugman.substack.com/">Paul Krugman’s</a>. Almost
always must-read stuff.
</p>
<p>
But he also writes on the “other side of the paywall.” When he announced
it, he said he doesn’t need the money, so I wondered why he does it. I
kept reading anyway.
</p>
<p>
But he does something incredibly annoying and as clueless imho as the
things he calls out in his writing — I only find out an article is on
the other side of the paywall after I’ve read the first few paragraphs.
I am a fan and I would send the money directly if he asked for it, but
not via Substack.
</p>
<p>
Here’s an
<a href="https://paulkrugman.substack.com/p/the-clean-little-secret-of-social">example</a>
of such a post.
</p>
<p>
So because I don’t pay I have to lose that time every time you do this?
Have some respect for us who read you. I’m as old as he is, and I like
to use my time well. So please either get rid of the stinking paywall,
or warn us up front.
</p>
<p>
And also consider getting off
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=substack">Substack</a>.
It’s not a good look.
