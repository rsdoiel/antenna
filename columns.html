is the easy editor that writers using WordPress always deserved. I
updated the <a href="https://this.how/wordland/">docs</a> this morning
to include very basic getting started stuff, and it now includes a link
to a form where you can apply to be a tester. At this time it’s limited
to people who know how to write a bug report, how to find and read the
JavaScript console in a web browser, and take a screen shot that shows
clearly what went wrong. This the hardest part of getting a product fit
for general use, and I’m too old to try to wrangle workable bug reports
from well-intentioned users who basically aren’t scientists. This time
I’m determined to do this the right way without excess wear and tear on
me. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span></p>

been inactive for a longish period of time.

<p>
Here are the

triggers after seventy-two hours of inactivity, even it is remains

<p>I’m using the term “RSS-based podcasts” in place of “podcasts” to
make sure whoever reads it knows to ask the question of other
“podcasts,” are you RSS-based? The best answer is to encourage YouTube
et al to just connect their “podcasts” to RSS and everyone’s happy. Like
“organic cheeseburgers.” :-)</p>

way to help <i>RSS-based podcasts</i> is to promote individual episodes
from the past. Sometimes shows are done, but the archive contains good
stuff. Not everything is based on current events. Music, art, history
for example. Also bring the feed out from hiding. At least the nerdy
people should understand how this stuff works. One of the big crimes was
when the browser makers tried to hide the feeds. I like to be able to
lift the hood even if I don’t understand what I’m looking at.</p>

<p>For the record, Bluesky has completely taken over from Threads.
Threads is basically at zero, needs something to shake it up. Obviously
this could be different for everyone. And engagement on Twitter is
pretty close to zero. I still check there periodically because despite
what people say a lot of people I follow still post there. And I do too,
since cross-posting costs me nothing. And it has been pointed out that
deleting your Twitter account comes with a fairly huge risk. And if you
do it, I wouldn’t announce it, because anyone apparently can claim your
account once it is completely deactivated. And that could create some
problems for you. Probably better to hold the account indefinitely.</p>

<p>Welcome to the last month of
<a href="http://scripting.com/">Scripting News</a> in the year 2024.
Each year goes by faster and faster. And as we move forward in time,
there’s less room in front of us on the runway of life, and more behind
us. At some point in the next decade my plane will probably take off. I
feel a sense of urgency about getting it done. Still a fair amount on my
todo list, but I’m making progress. As someone once said many times:
Still diggin!</p>
