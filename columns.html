Two articles crossed my path recently. First, a discussion of all the
video Waymo has from outside its cars:
<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/waymo-data-privacy-protests-los-angeles/">in
this case</a> related to the LA protests. Second, a discussion of all
the video Tesla has from
<a href="https://www.jalopnik.com/1884887/tesla-sentry-mode-explained/"><i>inside</i>
its cars</a>.
</p>
<p>
Lots of things are collecting lots of video of lots of other things. How
and under what rules that video is used and reused will be a continuing
source of debate.

<h2 id="passkeys-and-chatgpt">Passkeys and ChatGPT</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-18, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I had a conversation
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/emilynussbaum.bsky.social/post/3lrt3iyw5ic2j">on
Bluesky</a> with a writer saying she didn’t have much use for ChatGPT,
though she had tried it.
</p>
<p>
I wanted to see if I could open a door, suggesting that next time there
was an problem using a computer, that she bring the question to ChatGPT.
</p>
<p>
I think that’s good advice for anyone who hasn’t seen how useful these
are as tools. You can use it like a search engine. What comes back
answers your question. With Google you’d have to read through docs that
are meant to cover every angle, but the AI bot zeroes in on the issue
you’re dealing with. And the writing on ChatGPT is better than what you
would get on a random web page explaining a technical concept.
</p>
<p>
<b>Passkeys</b>
</p>
<p>
Previously I had tried to approach passkeys to get an idea of how I
should use them, but never grasped the big picture. I just didn’t
understand what they were doing, but I understood it was about
authentication. A hardware approach to identity, that much I got. How it
worked and how I would use it did not click.
</p>
<p>
And then earlier this week, an essential site that I use infrequently,
required using a passkey. When I had set it up a few months ago, as part
of a bigger develolpment task, I had no idea what I was doing, and
eventually bailed out, and left it unable to get back into the system,
which happened on Sunday. By default the browser, Chrome, had previously
connected it to my Pixel 9 Pro. There was a record of the connection
being used for a variety of other services, but the one I needed was not
there. This was after a full day of trying to debug it from the other
side. I now have a lot more info about how passkeys work, I won’t be
able to say I know enough until I’ve re-established the connection.
</p>
<p>
I know a lot of readers of this site understood passkeys without anyone
having to piece it together for them. I have never been one of those
people. Just the way my mind works, it’s why I’m a good person to test
software, I get lost easily.
</p>
<p>
All this is to say – think of ChatGPT as a technical assistant with
broad knowledge and patience. That’s where the real power is imho.

<p>date: 2025-06-18, updated: 2025-06-18, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
The variations seem to be endless. Here’s a
<a href="https://hardresetmedia.substack.com/p/one-nz-man-vs-pakistani-scammers">fake
ghostwriting scam</a> that seems to be making boatloads of money.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
This is a big story about scams being run from Texas and Pakistan
estimated to run into tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars,
viciously defrauding Americans with false hopes of publishing bestseller
books (a scam you’d not think many people would fall for but is
surprisingly huge). In January,
</span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdca/pr/three-indicted-and-internet-domain-seized-44-million-nationwide-book-publishing-scam">three
people were charged</a> with defrauding elderly authors across the
United States of almost $44 million ­by “convincing the victims that
publishers and filmmakers wanted to turn their books into
blockbusters.”…

<h2 id="the-unsung-principles-of-redwoodsdk">The unsung principles of
RedwoodSDK</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-18, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
We had <a href="https://shoptalkshow.com/669/">Peter Pistorius on
ShopTalk</a> to talk about RedwoodJS and the project’s pivot to an
almost entirely different project called
<a href="https://rwsdk.com/">RedwoodSDK</a>. I am a complete outsider
but I liked what RedwoodJS (the old project) was trying to do and didn’t
fully understand why they felt the need to reboot. I even have a dusty
old post in my drafts folder about what I liked about RedwoodJS. But
after talking, it seems the winds of the JavaScript zeitgeist has
changed and technology picks from 2020 aren’t the best deep integrations
to have anymore.
</p>
<p>
After talking to Peter, I was pleasantly surprised by the principles
that guide the new RedwoodSDK project:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Zero magic - No codegen or transpiler side effects
</li>
<li>
Composability over configuration - No opinionated wrappers
</li>
<li>
Uses native Web APIs - No abstraction over fetch, Request, Response, or
URL
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Those are all principles I can get behind. But what impressed me the
most was how RedwoodSDK prioritizes economic justice at the framework
level. Peter from the show:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We set up with these principles, and we wrote them down, and they come
from a place where I am geographically located. The principles are
informed from where I am right now in South Africa. We have really poor
people and really rich people. I think we have the highest income
disparity in the world… People here don’t have very good mobile phones,
they have mobile phones – everyone does – the networks are also pretty
fast but bandwidth is expensive and so is memory on phones, and phones
are slow. They’re not the best things you have out there. So we designed
this framework with these principles in mind in order to deliver the
least amount of JavaScript and consume the least amount of bandwidth
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
For RedwoodSDK, this principle manifests in minimal code sent to the
client via React Server Components. RedwoodSDK also has a tight
integration with Cloudflare and its edge worker platform which (for most
folks) is free. That in turn reduces costs for website owners and
customers, which is beneficial in markets with low-bandwidth or
pay-per-gigabyte mobile connections.
</p>
<p>
No $20/mo hosting lock-in scheme.
</p>
<p>
For Redwood, the goal isn’t to power the next big billion dollar SaaS
product (although I’m sure they’d welcome that), but to enable
“homegrown” or
<a href="https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/home-cooked-app/">home-cooked
web apps</a> that are easy to build, maintain, and low-cost to run.
Allow people to build that bespoke app for their bespoke need for
themselves or their community. Their new tagline is “This could be the
start of something small” and the tech world needs more of that.
</p>
<p>
I wish Web Components had a project like this…

<h2 id="chekuskins-dream">Chekuskin’s dream</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-18, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Chekuskin dreamed he was in a factory sidling up the walkspace, besides
some immense machine. But when he put his hand on it to steady himself,
instead of cold metal the surface he felt was lively and warm. Little
tremors ran through it, but not mechanical ones. The machine he saw was
viley alive. Beneath a membrane of purpleish black, fluids were pulsing
thickly from chamber to chamber. He stepped back, but his hand would not
come free. It had stuck to the machine and now he realized there was no
real palm to his hand anymore. He could no more pull away than he could
pull his arm off. His arm, his whole body, were outgrowths of the
machine. Just a siphon in a man’s shape through which the same fluid
sluggishly circulated. But then the walls were gone, but the machine
remained. It stretched away into snowy darkness. Somehow because he was
part of it, he could feel its vastness. At its edges it was tirelessly
eating whatever remained in the world that was not yet it. And it
consumed its own wastes too. It was warm and poisonous, and it grew and
grew and grew.
</p>
<p>
But in the morning. He felt much better. The dream washed away in a hot
shower.

2025-06-18 Israel hate mail
</h1>
<p>
I got my first comment regarding my position on Israel in a very, very
long time. It wondered why I had not blogged anything about the
situation in October 2023.
</p>
<p>
Well, what can I say?
</p>
<p>
Back then, I did not know that Israel was going to kill so many
civilians in bloody revenge.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
On 7 October 2023, Hamas-led militant groups launched a surprise attack
on Israel, in which 1,195 Israelis and foreign nationals, including 815
civilians, were killed, and 251 taken hostage with the stated goal of
forcing Israel to release Palestinian prisoners. After clearing
militants from its territory, Israel launched a bombing campaign and
invaded Gaza on 27 October with the stated objectives of destroying
Hamas and freeing the hostages. Israeli forces launched numerous
campaigns during the invasion, including the Rafah offensive from May
2024, three battles fought around Khan Yunis, and the siege of North
Gaza from October 2024, and have assassinated Hamas leaders inside and
outside of Gaza. A temporary ceasefire in November 2023 broke down, and
a second ceasefire in January 2025 ended with a surprise attack by
Israel in March 2025.
</p>
<p>
Since the start of the Israeli offensive, over 55,000 Palestinians in
Gaza have been killed, over half of them women and children, and more
than 128,000 Palestinians have been injured. A study in The Lancet
estimated 64,260 deaths due to traumatic injuries by June 2024, while
noting a larger potential death toll when “indirect” deaths are
included. Israel’s tightened blockade of Gaza cut off basic necessities,
causing a severe hunger crisis with a high risk of famine persisting as
of May 2025. By early 2025, Israel had caused unprecedented destruction
in Gaza and made large parts of it uninhabitable, leveling entire cities
and destroying hospitals (including children’s hospitals), agricultural
land, religious and cultural landmarks, educational facilities, and
cemeteries. Gazan journalists, health workers, aid workers and other
members of civil society have been detained, tortured and killed. Nearly
all of the strip’s 2.3 million Palestinian population have been forcibly
displaced. Over 100,000 Israelis were internally displaced at the height
of the conflict.

Or how about
<a href="https://www.ochaopt.org/content/humanitarian-situation-update-294-gaza-strip">Humanitarian
Situation Update #294 | Gaza Strip</a>? Here’s a high-level view
malnutrition spreading:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The nutritional situation of children continues to deteriorate.
According to the Nutrition Cluster, preliminary analysis indicates that
out of 46,738 children under five years of age who were screened for
malnutrition in the second half of May, 2,733 (5.8 per cent) were
diagnosed with acute malnutrition. This is up from 4.7 per cent in the
first half of May and almost triple the proportion of children diagnosed
with malnutrition out of those screened in February 2025, during the
ceasefire. Overall, since January, Nutrition Cluster partners detected
and enrolled over 16,500 children under five for treatment of severe
acute malnutrition (SAM), including 141 cases with complications who
needed to be hospitalized. Overall, in May, 7.5 per cent of SAM cases
needed hospitalization for complications, compared with only three to
four per cent in the preceding two months, showing an increase in number
of severe cases. Yet, there are currently only four stabilization
centres for the treatment of SAM cases with medical complications in the
Gaza Strip, including two in Deir al Balah, one in Khan Younis, and one
in Gaza city. Stabilization centres in North Gaza and Rafah have been
forced to suspend operations, leaving children in these areas without
access to lifesaving treatment. Moreover, analysis of available data for
pregnant and breastfeeding women (PBW) confirms that there has been a
sharp deterioration in their nutritional status in the last two months;
in May, acute malnutrition was detected in 17 per cent of screened PBW
in Gaza governorate and in 18 per cent of screened PBW in Deir al Balah,
compared with less than 10 per cent in these two governorates in
February and March.

Palestinian Arabs and over 500 Arab-majority towns, villages, and urban
neighborhoods were depopulated. Many of the settlements were either
completely destroyed or repopulated by Jews and given new Hebrew names.

Or read a book. I’ve read a book by Alain Gresh on Israel and Palestine.
I’ve read a book or two by Noam Chomsky on Israel, Palestine.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Monde_diplomatique">Le Monde
Diplomatique</a> writes about the situation on a regular basis. I’ve
been reading about Israel and Palestine for a while. I remember when
23-year-old American activist Rachel Corrie was run over by a bulldozer
as she stood barring its way (<a href="2003-03-19_Israel">2003-03-19

<a href="https://electronicintifada.net/">The Electronic Initfada</a>.
If I know one thing it’s that the situation is very complicated, that
human rights are violated every day, and that the response to the
violation of human rights is not more violations of human rights.
</p>
<p>
All should go to court.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The landmark ruling of 19 July 2024 declared that Israel’s occupation of
the Gaza strip and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, is unlawful,
along with the associated settlement regime, annexation and use of
natural resources. The Court added that Israel’s legislation and
measures violate the international prohibition on racial segregation and
apartheid. The ICJ mandated Israel to end its occupation, dismantle its
settlements, provide full reparations to Palestinian victims and
facilitate the return of displaced people. –

<p>
This is just the first paragraph of the alleged crimes of Benjamin
Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The Chamber found reasonable grounds to believe that during the relevant
time, international humanitarian law related to international armed
conflict between Israel and Palestine applied. This is because they are
two High Contracting Parties to the 1949 Geneva Conventions and because
Israel occupies at least parts of Palestine. The Chamber also found that
the law related to non-international armed conflict applied to the
fighting between Israel and Hamas. The Chamber found that the alleged
conduct of Mr Netanyahu and Mr Gallant concerned the activities of
Israeli government bodies and the armed forces against the civilian
population in Palestine, more specifically civilians in Gaza. It
therefore concerned the relationship between two parties to an
international armed conflict, as well as the relationship between an
occupying power and the population in occupied territory. For these
reasons, with regards to war crimes, the Chamber found it appropriate to
issue the arrest warrants pursuant to the law of international armed
conflict. The Chamber also found that the alleged crimes against
humanity were part of a widespread and systematic attack against the
civilian population of Gaza. –

<p>
Same here, there first paragraph of the alleged crimes of Mohammed Diab
Ibrahim Al-Masri:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
With regard to the crimes, the Chamber found reasonable grounds to
believe that on 7 October 2023, shortly after a large number of rockets
triggered the ‘Tzeva Adom’ alarm in several communities in Israel around
6:20-6:30 am, armed men entered these communities, as well as the site
of the Supernova festival, a music event with a few thousand
participants (‘7 October Operation’). Members of Hamas, notably fighters
of the al-Qassam Brigades, carried out mass killings at and/or around
the communities of Kfar Aza, Holit, Nir Oz, Be’eri, and Nahal Oz, as
well as at the Supernova festival. The attackers, for example, fired at
people while they were seeking shelter and threw grenades at them. Hamas
fighters followed similar patterns in other locations and killed further
persons. These killings qualify as the crime against humanity and the
war crime of murder. –

</h1>
<p>
More people have been working on blocking whole ranges of IP numbers,
since that catches hosting providers that give bots access to the whole
range they control. The bots switch IP numbers all the time so a filter
based on IP numbers won’t catch them. But if we can determine their
autonomous system number (ASN), we can not only block an IP number
range, we can block all the IP number rangers the ASN controls.
</p>
<p>
Now, since these hosting providers also host nice things like other
fediverse instances, I don’t want to block them forever. I want to block
them for 10min, and if they continue after a few of these shorter
blocks, I want to block them for a week. Hopefully, their clients have
ended their Internet slurping and things are back to normal. This is how
fail2ban works, but only for individual IP numbers.
</p>
<p>
I want code that bridges this gap.

<a href="github.com/WKnak/fail2ban-bloc">fail2ban-bloc</a> tries to

more.
</p>
<p>
I’m still fascinated by
<a href="https://anarc.at/blog/2025-05-30-asncounter/">asncounter</a>.
It might even work without logfiles, using <code>tcpdump</code>! For
now, it generates an interesting Top 10 list. What’s interesting about
it is that it doesn’t require me to query an external service and leak
IP numbers.
</p>
<p>
I used to have the following fish function, for example:
</p>
<pre><code>function asn
    for ip in $argv
        dig +short (string split '.' $ip|tac -|string join '.').origin.asn.cymru.com. TXT
    end
end
</code></pre>
<p>
What I don’t want to do is write another tool like
<a href="/admin/network-lookup-lean">network-lookup-lean</a> which uses
<code>asn.routeviews.org</code> for the same purposes, caches results,
and so on. I want to get rid of this live lookup.

<h2 id="ban-all-the-networks-managed-by-an-asn">
Ban all the networks managed by an ASN
</h2>
<p>
I’m going to use <code>ipset</code> to use two lists,
<code>banlist</code> and <code>banlist6</code>. I use these two for
<a href="/admin/ban-cidr">ban-cidr</a>, too.
</p>
<pre><code># Use hash:net because of the CIDR stuff
ipset create banlist hash:net
iptables -I INPUT -m set --match-set banlist src -j DROP

ip6tables -I INPUT -m set --match-set banlist6 src -j DROP

</code></pre>
<p>
To ban all the IP ranges an ASN manages, I created the following little
fish function using <code>ip.guide</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>function asn-ban
    for asn in $argv
        for cidr in (curl -sL &quot;https://ip.guide/as$asn&quot; | jq --raw-output '.routes.v4[]')
            echo ipset add banlist $cidr
        end
        for cidr in (curl -sL &quot;https://ip.guide/as$asn&quot; | jq --raw-output '.routes.v6[]')
            echo ipset add banlist6 $cidr
        end
    end
end
</code></pre>
<p>
Let’s try it with the ASN 45899!
</p>
<pre><code>asn-ban 45899 | sh
netfilter-persistent save
</code></pre>
<p>
For more about <code>netfilter-persistent save</code> see the comments
on <a href="2025-01-23-bots-devouring-the-web">2025-01-23 The bots are
at it again</a>.
</p>
<p>
When I ran the <code>asn-ban</code> command above, I noticed that I got
a single “it’s already added” response. Before adding the same numbers
to my shell script, therefore:
</p>
<pre><code>for cidr in (asn-ban 45899|awk '{print $4}'); if grep -q $cidr bin/admin/ban-cidr; echo $cidr; end; end
</code></pre>
<p>
That told me I had to remove <code>14.187.96.0/20</code> from my script.
Once this is done:
</p>
<pre><code>echo (echo &quot;#&quot;; date --iso)  &gt;&gt; bin/admin/ban-cidr
asn-ban 45899 &gt;&gt; bin/admin/ban-cidr

I really need to figure out how to manage this smartly. And I need to
figure out a way to unban the whole list!

<p>
Let’s start with <code>fail2ban</code>. I need a jail! Every jail needs
a filter!

<p>
In <code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/alex.conf</code> (this is where I maintain
all my jails) I added:
</p>
<pre><code>[butlerian-jihad]

<p>
Note that this jail doesn’t define log paths. I hope that works as
intended.
</p>
<p>
I created a matching filter with no definition in

</p>
<pre><code># Author: Alex Schroeder &lt;alex@gnu.org&gt;

I should check whether this actually works! Let’s see whether the ban
gets lifted after 24h. That’s the main point of this exercise!
</p>
<p>
<code>asn-ban</code> uses the <code>ip.guide</code> site for the data.
This should be rewritten such that it uses the same data as
<code>asncounter</code>. I guess that would be
<a href="https://github.com/hadiasghari/pyasn">pyasn</a>. See below!
</p>
<p>
I need a cron job that runs every 10 minutes, takes the last ten minutes
worth of Apache access log files, ignores the fedi subdomain, identifies
all the ASNs, ignores my own ASNs and bans the rest.

<p>
<a href="/admin/asn-networks">asn-networks</a> is a tiny script with a
bunch of lines taken from <code>asncounter</code> to print the IP ranges
managed by one or more autonomous systems.
</p>
<pre><code>python3 asn-ban 209366
185.170.167.0/24
185.191.171.0/24

</code></pre>
<p>
It uses the <code>pyasn</code> datafiles that a regular run of
<code>asncounter</code> has downloaded. That is to say,
<code>asn-networks</code> does not download or refresh these files. I’m
assuming that you have run <code>asncounter</code> just moments earlier.
</p>
<p>
Given this script, we can now call <code>fail2ban-client</code> as
follows (I use fish) to ban all the networks:
</p>
<pre><code>fail2ban-client set butlerian-jihad banip (asn-networks 209366)
5
</code></pre>
<p>
Unbanning works the same way:
</p>
<pre><code>fail2ban-client set butlerian-jihad unbanip (asn-networks 209366)
5
</code></pre>
<p>
Remember that <code>fail2ban-client</code> prints the number of IP
numbers or ranges added or removed.
</p>
<h2 id="identifying-suspicious-asn">
Identifying suspicious ASN
</h2>
<p>
What is suspicious activity? How about this: In a 2h window, no ASN
should send more than 1000 requests? So we need a script that filters
the log files and prints a 2h window, skipping the lines we want to
ignore: <a href="/admin/2h-access-log">2h-access-log</a>. Then pass the
IP numbers to <code>asncounter</code>, throw away all the things we
don’t care about and just print the appropriate lines:
</p>
<pre><code>bin/2h-access-log !^social \
| awk '{print $2}' \
| bin/asncounter --no-prefixes 2&gt;/dev/null \
| awk '/^[0-9]/ &amp;&amp; $1&gt;1000  { print }'
3062    31.93   24940   HETZNER-AS, DE
1642    17.12   16276   OVH, FR
</code></pre>
<p>
So do I dare ban those numbers?? I’m not sure! I should figure out a way
to find those 3062 requests made by services hosted on Hetzner.
</p>
<p>
<a href="/admin/asn-access-log">asn-access-log</a> does just that. You
pass it an ASN, it determines all the networks it manages and then it
filters standard input, assuming that it consists of Apache access log
lines (what counts is that the second field is an IP number).
</p>
<pre><code>bin/2h-access-log !^social | bin/asn-access-log 24940
</code></pre>
<p>
I see a lot of RSS services (NewsBlur, fiperbot, MyNewspaper Agent,
FreshRSS), git, some bot (from the 159.69.0.0/16 range, for example),
and on and on. Ugh. It’s not easy to know what to do!
</p>
<p>
I think the best answer would be to lower the stakes but also ban for
shorter amounts of time and let <code>fail2ban</code> handle the rest.
The only thing I need to consider is whether I find the current amount
of resources spent OK. Do I? Let’s look at the latest numbers.
</p>
<p>
This here shows that fedi traffic is 60% Hetzner and OVH. This makes it
hard for me to block these autonomous systems.

<p>
The autonomous systems that show up in the second list but not in the
first list are my prime candidates, like COMCAST and CHINAMOBILE-CN.
</p>
<p>
So how about going after the autonomous systems on the second list that
produce more than 1000 hits in a 2h period.
</p>
<p>
Something like this? I’m going to but this into
<code>/etc/cron.daily/butlerian-jihad</code>
</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
bin/2h-access-log !^social !178.209.50.237 \

</p>
<h2 id="summary">
Summary
</h2>
<p>
<code>/etc/cron.daily/butlerian-jihad</code> runs every hour and checks
if there have been any abusive autonomous systems in the last two hours.
If so, they are banned. Note how I’ve added my home IPv4 and IPv6
because I use my site a lot. 😅
</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
bin/2h-access-log !^social !178.209.50.237 !MY-HOME-IPV4 !MY-HOME-IPV6 \
| awk '{print $2}' \
| bin/asncounter --no-prefixes 2&gt;/dev/null \
| awk '/^[0-9]/ &amp;&amp; $1&gt;1000 { print $3 }' \
| ifne xargs bin/asn-networks \
| ifne xargs fail2ban-client set butlerian-jihad banip \
&gt; /dev/null
</code></pre>
<p>
This drops the output (the number of new bans) because otherwise the
cron job mails that number to me.
</p>
<p>
<a href="/admin/2h-access-log">2h-access-log</a> prints the last two
hours worth of log lines from <code>/var/log/apache2/access.log</code>
(and <code>access.log.1</code> if necessary).
</p>
<p>
The <code>!^social</code> argument ensures that connecting to my fedi
server doesn’t trigger the ban hammer.
</p>
<p>
The <code>!178.209.50.237</code> argument ensures that I don’t ban the
server itself as it monitors stuff and as I test things on the server. I
also had to add my home IP numbers!
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://gitlab.com/anarcat/asncounter/">asncounter</a> finds
the autonomous system numbers for all the IP numbers in the web server
log file and prints a report.
</p>
<p>
<a href="/admin/asn-networks">asn-networks</a> then turns the selected
autonomous system numbers and returns the IP ranges they manage.
</p>
<p>
These are then banned by <code>fail2ban-client</code> using the
<code>butlerian-jihad</code> jail.
</p>
<p>
The <code>butlerian-jihad</code> jail is mentioned in enabled via a
config file in <code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/</code>. In my case, the file
is called <code>alex.conf</code> and for this jail, it says:
</p>
<pre><code>[butlerian-jihad]
enabled = true
bantime = 1h
</code></pre>
<p>
The jail also needs a filter definition even though no filtering happens
as no logfile is checked. My
<code>/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/butlerian-jihad.conf</code> contains just
this:
</p>
<pre><code># Author: Alex Schroeder &lt;alex@gnu.org&gt;
[Definition]
</code></pre>
<p>
What this means is that every hour, an autonomous system unit can get
banned. If they are banned, they are banned for 1h. If they are banned
for activity in the last hour leading up to the ban, the script will
find the same log entries and ban them “again”. This results in no
changes in the jail, since all the networks are already in the
<code>butlerian-jihad</code> jail.
</p>
<p>
The bans themselves are reported in <code>/etc/log/fail2ban.log</code>.
</p>
<p>
I’ve also enabled the <code>recidive</code> jail. That is, in the same
file where I defined my <code>butlerian-jihad</code> jail, I have:
</p>
<pre><code>[recidive]
enabled = true
</code></pre>
<p>
The defaults are in <code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.conf</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>[recidive]

logpath  = /var/log/fail2ban.log
banaction = %(banaction_allports)s
bantime  = 1w
findtime = 1d
</code></pre>
<p>
So if some network is banned for more than five times in a day, it is
banned for a week. I say five times because <code>maxretry</code> is set
to 5 in <code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.conf</code>.
</p>
<p>
Let’s assume a scraper is started from some network managed by an
autonomous system. It starts using IP numbers from all its ranges. It
sends 600 requests per hour, more than a human could read and more than
a feed reader should need, etc.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
after the first hour, nothing happens, as 600 is less than the 1000
needed to trigger the system
</li>
<li>
after the second hour, the ASN is banned because the sum total for the
last two hours is 1200
</li>
<li>
after the third hour, the ASN is unbanned and not banned again because
it only made 600 requests in the second hour
</li>
<li>
after the fourth hour, the ASN is banned again (1200 requests)
</li>
<li>
after the fifth hour, the ASN is unbanned
</li>
<li>
after the sixth hour, the ASN is banned for the third time (1200
requests)
</li>
<li>
after the seventh hour, the ASN is unbanned
</li>
<li>
after the eighth hour, the ASN is banned for the fourth time (1200
requests)
</li>
<li>
after the ninth hour, the ASN is unbanned
</li>
<li>
after the tenth hour, the ASN is banned for the fifth time (1200
requests)
</li>
<li>
after the eleventh hour, the ASN is unbanned
</li>
<li>
after the twelfth hour, the ASN is banned for the sixth time, the
<code>recidive</code> filter kicks in and the networks belonging to the
ASN are banned for a week
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This escalation takes twelve hours. The ASN was already banned for half
this time.
</p>
<p>
Assuming this repeats every week, it means that the pattern repeats
every 7½ weeks and the abusive ASN still gets service on 6h out of 180h
or 3% of the time. For my taste, that is still way too nice.
</p>
<p>
Let’s see how this goes for a while.
</p>
<p>
I’m already looking forward to dropping my <code>banlist</code> and
<code>banlist6</code> sets I created for
<a href="/admin/ban-cidr">ban-cidr</a>.

Back when I first encountered the distributed AI bot attacks, I wrote
<a href="2024-09-15-emacs-china">2024-09-18 Emacs Wiki and China</a> and
began working on <code>ban-cidr</code>. In later posts, I just automated
the work of getting from an IP number to a network range and adding that
to the script. Now that I hopefully have an automatic solution where I
only need to fine-tune the time-windows and the limits, it’s time to
expire all those bans. There are currently over 40,000 of these banned
networks.
</p>
<pre><code>ipset list banlist | tail -n +9 | wc -l
46920
ipset list banlist6 | tail -n +9 | wc -l

So slowly, over time, I’m planning to remove these.

<p>
Ugh. They need to go.
</p>
<p>
First, create the two lists. At this level we need two different lists
for IPv4 and IPv6.
</p>
<pre><code>ipset create banlist hash:net
iptables -I INPUT -m set --match-set banlist src -j DROP
iptables -I FORWARD -m set --match-set banlist src -j DROP

ipset create banlist6 hash:net family inet6
ip6tables -I INPUT -m set --match-set banlist6 src -j DROP
ip6tables -I FORWARD -m set --match-set banlist6 src -j DROP
</code></pre>
<p>
Then define a new version of <code>asn-ban</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>function asn-ban
    set --local data (asn-networks --json $argv)
    for asn in $argv
        for ip in (echo $data | jq --raw-output &quot;.[\&quot;$asn\&quot;].v4[]&quot;)
            echo ipset add banlist $ip
        end
        for ip in (echo $data | jq --raw-output &quot;.[\&quot;$asn\&quot;].v6[]&quot;)
            echo ipset add banlist6 $ip
        end
    end
end
</code></pre>
<p>
This uses the <code>–json</code> option for
<a href="/admin/asn-networks">asn-networks</a> so that we only need to
call it once and yet we get two lists: one for <code>banlist</code> and
one for <code>banlist6</code>.
</p>
<p>
To ban the offending ASN:
</p>
<pre><code>asn-ban 55836|sh
</code></pre>
<p>
Before I do that, however, I want to finish clearing the existing lists.
</p>
<p>
The reason I call this petty banning is because I’m starting to ban
autonomous systems even though their bots are “well behaved” in as much
as they don’t exceed the thresholds I defined. And yet they seem to be
part of that great parade to honour the CO₂ god, the computation of
useless shit.

<p>It's not the heat (though we have that too). Humidity is 85% here
right now. Everything is sticky. Summer in the Midwest. Also the East.
And the South. Only more of it. And worse. Interesting: warmer oceans
are a cause. The WaPo explains. (Sorry, paywall.)</p>

legacy media:<br />
<blockquote>
A challenge with storage is the longevity of the media and the
availability of hardware capable of retrieving it. While paper tape and
punch cards are long-lasting and can be read by enterprising enthusiasts
of today, modern densely packed SSDs and spinning disks might present
more of a challenge for the archivists of tomorrow.

<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/06/12/archival_storage_feature/"><i>Tape,
glass, and molecules – the future of archival storage</i></a> looks at
the issues I covered in
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2025/03/archival-storage.html"><i>Archival
Storage</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The future of archival data storage is tape, more tape, and then
possibly glass-based tech, with DNA and other molecular tech still a
distant prospect.<br /> <br /> The function of archival storage is to
keep data for the long term – decades and beyond – reliably and
affordably. Currently, the main medium for this is LTO tape and it is
slow, has a limited life, and not enough capacity considering the
implications of ever-increasing image and video resolution and
AI-infused data generation. However, there is as yet no viable tape
replacement technology at scale, only possibilities, with optical
storage more practical and nearer to productization than DNA or other
molecular storage.
</blockquote>
Mellor mostly agrees with me, but is more optimistic about Cerabyte’s
technology than I am. It is less aggressive than Project Silica, writing
a single layer of data onto glass tablets. He reports that:<br />
<blockquote>
Cerabyte has attracted investment from In-Q-Tel, Pure Storage, and
Western Digital. Shantnu Sharma, WD’s Chief Strategy and Corporate
Development Officer, said: “We are looking forward to working with
Cerabyte to formulate a technology partnership for the commercialization
of this technology.”<br /> …<br /> Like Project Silica, it is, in our
assessment, two to five years away from commercial product availability,
but it will then be commercially available.

trendline doesn’t look good for hard disk drives</i></a> covers the
evolution of the hard disk market to its current focus on nearline
storage for hyperscalers:<br />
<blockquote>
In early May, independent digital storage analyst Thomas Coughlin
<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomcoughlin/2025/05/03/c1q-2025-hdd-industry-update/">shared</a>
news of falling sales and revenue in the first quarter of 2025,
continuing a trend that started in around 2010. Coughlin
<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomcoughlin/2024/12/06/digital-storage-and-memory-projections-for-2025-part-1/">cites</a>
data from that year showing around 600 million annual hard disk
shipments.<br /> <br /> In 2025 he thinks around 150 million units will
make it out of factory doors. <br /> Hyperscale datacenter operators
will buy most of them and have become HDD manufacturers’ largest
customers.<br /> …<br /> While HDD volumes fall, collective annual
shipped HDD capacity is rising – so even though fewer machines are made,
they collectively contain more gigabytes than last year’s larger disk
fleet.

still HAMRing away at the 100 TB disk drive decades later</i></a>
recounts the saga of Seagate’s
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190813175046/https://www.seagate.com/news/news-archive/seagate-swings-increase-disc-drive-densities-master-pr/">two-and-a-half
decade long</a> effort to get Heat Assisted Magnetic Recording disks
into mass production:<br />
<blockquote>
Seagate is currently shipping 30 TB conventionally recorded Exos M HAMR
drives and both 32 and 36 TB shingled magnetic recording (SMR) drives.
These have blocks of partially overlapping write tracks to increase
track density and thus overall capacity, but with a slower rewrite speed
as entire blocks of tracks have to be rewritten.<br /> <br /> The
company should have a clear drive capacity advantage, but it does not
because its HAMR technology has proven extraordinarily difficult to
bring into mass production and it has one less platter than competing
drives. By 2012, Seagate predicted it could make 1 Tb/in² in HAMR drives
after a successful
<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2012/03/20/seagate_terabit_areal_density/">demo</a>.
That did not happen but it managed to make 16 TB HAMR drives and was
sampling them in 2019. They did not make it to mass production either,
and a 20 TB technology was the next development. It too did not last
long.<br /> <br /> CEO Dave Mosley told
<a href="https://blocksandfiles.com/2020/11/20/seagate-ceo-talks-about-big-jumps/">investment
analysts in 2020</a> that Seagate was stepping up to 24 TB HAMR drives.
By 2023, a 30 TB HAMR drive was said to be coming. This was actually
unveiled in
<a href="https://blocksandfiles.com/2024/01/17/seagate-hamr-drives/">January
2024</a>, with the tech branded Mozaic 3+, referring to the 32 and then
36 TB SMR variants.
</blockquote>
Mellor notes the impact this history has had on Seagate’s
credibilty:<br />
<blockquote>
Seagate has previously made several predictions about HAMR drive
availability that were not ultimately achieved. The tech giant appears
to have persistently underestimated how long it will take to productize
HAMR technology and so reap the production cost benefit of having fewer
platters and sliders at any capacity point than its two competitors.

<h2 id="where-ai-provides-value">Where AI Provides Value</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-17, updated: 2025-06-17, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
If you’ve worried that AI might take your job, deprive you of your
livelihood, or maybe even replace your role in society, it probably
feels good to see the latest AI tools fail spectacularly. If AI
recommends
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/23/24162896/google-ai-overview-hallucinations-glue-in-pizza">glue
as a pizza topping</a>, then you’re safe for another day.
</p>
<p>
But the fact remains that AI already has definite advantages over even
the most skilled humans, and knowing where these advantages arise—and
where they don’t—will be key to adapting to the AI-infused workforce.
</p>
<p>
AI will often not be as effective as a human doing the same job. It
won’t always know more or be more accurate. And it definitely won’t
always be fairer or more reliable. But it may still be used whenever it
has an advantage over humans in one of four dimensions: speed, scale,
scope and sophistication. Understanding these dimensions is the key to
understanding AI-human replacement…

this
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/13/opinion/obama-save-america-trump.html">piece</a>
in the NYT has a
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/06/15/joerogue.png">bit of
wisdom</a> that I had not considered because I don’t listen to Joe Rogan
it would never occur to me. He’s relaxing white noise, chatting in the
background while you play a game or write a blog post or text message on
your phone, or just think about something unrelated. I forgot that mode
of media consumption. I’m always on the hunt for that kind of content.
That’s why sports games are so good. You can almost completely tune out,
knowing they’ll replay the best stuff.
</p>
<p>
Reminds of a meeting we had a
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=Berkman">Berkman</a> in
the early days of podcasting. Most of the faculty were of course not on
board with what we were doing, possibly believing that it threatened
public radio (didn’t turn out that way at all, they made incredibly good
use of podcasting). One of the guys from
<a href="https://www.prx.org/">PRX</a> which was also incubating there
at the time, said at me in a challenging way – You get the best info
from public radio! Right? I thought for a minute and realized this was a
good question. No, I said, it’s relaxing, I can tune out while I’m
driving or walking around town. Loud groans. But it’s so true. Now it’s
great when there’s a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dept._Q">TV
series</a> that really
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=disbelief">catches</a>
your attention, I love that too, but most of my media-ingesting time is
with white noise, background relaxation. The world is still okay when
the background noise on MSNBC are still on the air between the ever more
disgusting ads for diseases I probably will never get.
</p>
<p>
There must be a better way.
</p>
<p>
It’s like the canaries in a coalmine. When they go off the air that’s
when you really have to start worrying!
</p>
<p>
BTW, PRX was a good idea. Brilliant actually. Distribute the content
from the public radio sources that generate too much to the ones in less
populated areas where they don’t generate enough. Podcasting blew that
up – but PRX adjusted their approach, and became a distributor of
podcasting. That’s an entrepreneur’s approach. The were able to pivot
and continue to make a contribution to this day.
</p>
<p>
I often wonder how we missed the opportunity to build a great media
incubator at Harvard in the 00s. We were right there, and the backer of
Berkman wanted entrepreurial projects, I found out at the reunion two
summers ago. We had it, were there, if only.. Heh when you get to be my
age there’s lots of that.
</p>
<p>
Also I wonder how I missed the potential of WordPress all those years.
Ships passing in the night. But we’re there now, so..

figured that yesterday’s army march in DC would have caused clashes with
the police in more places than it did, perhaps due to false flag attacks
“from the left” at one of the many No King Day parades around the
country. I thought this was the moment when it would all melt down.
America’s Reichstad Fire. If it were an episode of Mission Impossible or
Batman, it would definitely have gone that way. I bet there were plans
hatched on open chat channels between various Cabinet members and their
families, and probably Elon Musk via an interpreter, to coordinate. I
was also surprised there weren’t any Tesla Cybertrucks in yesterday’s
parade. I guess the honeymoon is really over. Anyway, they had to have
had a plan, but I keep forgetting this is not Generalissimo Trump,
rather it’s TV President “Taco” Trump. I think they had a plan and he
lost his nerve at the last minute. Instead, the Maga in Minnesota lit a
different fuse, assassinating the speaker of the state house. That’s a
line that hadn’t yet been crossed, but you knew the day would come. It’s
here.</p>

you think we need to find a way past the billionaires, then we have to
find a way around the established media. They keep selling us out and we
keep acting as if we show them that they’re doing it in a way they
understand they’ll get on our side. But they can’t. “It is difficult to
get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not
understanding it,”
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upton_Sinclair">wrote</a>
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/21810-it-is-difficult-to-get-a-man-to-understand-something">Upton
Sinclair</a> in 1935. It’s still true 90 years later. Another great
philosopher, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Moonves">Les
Moonves</a>,
<a href="https://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2016/02/les-moonves-trump-cbs-220001">said</a>
in 2016, “It may not be good for America, but it’s damn good for CBS,”
referring to Trump’s run for president. It was good presumably because
of increased viewership resulting more ad revenue. I’m sure it’s still
true today, though CBS stopped boasting about it in public.</p>
