Much of this series has been based on the outstanding reporting of the
<i>Washington Post</i>, and the team’s Trisha Thadani is back with
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/04/28/tesla-trial-autopilot-lawsuit/"><i>Lawsuits
test Tesla claim that drivers are solely responsible for
crashes</i></a>. My main concern all along has been that Musk’s
irresponsible hyping of his flawed technology is not just killing his
credulous customers, but much more seriously innocent bystanders who had
no say in the matter. The article includes video of:<br />
<ul>
<li>
A driver who believed Autopilot could drive him home despite his being
drunk. The car drove the wrong way on the highway and killed another
innocent victim of Musk’s hype.
</li>
<li>
Autopilot rear-ending a merging vehicle and killing another innocent
victim, a 15-year-old.
</li>
<li>
Autopilot slamming into a broken down vehicle on the highway. When the
Tesla driver left the wreck she was hit and killed by another car.
</li>
<li>
Autopilot speeding through a T-junction and crashing into a parked
truck.
</li>
</ul>
Below the fold I look into Tesla’s results, Musk’s response, the details
revealed by the various lawsuits. and this excellent advice from Elon
Musk:<br />
<blockquote>
“If somebody doesn’t believe Tesla is going to solve autonomy, I think
they should not be an investor in the company.”
<blockquote>
<a href="https://jalopnik.com/musk-says-you-should-not-be-an-investor-in-the-company-1851432004">Elon

<h3>
The Results
</h3>
In
<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/485109f3-9118-4d75-a202-58bd2b89da45"><i>Tesla’s
biggest problem: cars</i></a>, Drew Dickson looks at Tesla’s first
quarter results:<br />
<blockquote>
Of Tesla’s total quarterly sales of $21.3bn, 82 per cent were indeed
“automotive revenues” while the rest were energy and services.<br />
…<br /> Tesla burned through $2.5bn of cash in the quarter. Inventories
grew by over 10 per cent to $16bn.
</blockquote>
82% of $21.3B is $17.5B, so Tesla has almost an entire quarter of unsold
cars on hand.<br /> <br /> One problem is that Musk’s persona as an
extreme right-wing troll has been putting off the
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/30/opinion/elon-musk-tesla-democrats.html">key
Tesla customer demographic</a>, well-off liberals who care about climate
change. Another problem is that Tesla lineup of models is old and
expensive. Tesla used to recognize that they needed
<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/485109f3-9118-4d75-a202-58bd2b89da45">a
cheaper product</a> but:<br />
<blockquote>
A cut-price Model 2 was first teased at the 2023 Tesla AGM, with Musk
saying in January that it would be in production towards the end of next
year, but the expected spring product announcement never came.<br />
<br /> Tesla now states it is “accelerating” plans, though as with the
Cybertruck it’s easy to mistake the accelerator for the brakes. The
notion that a Model 2 might be built in new factories in Mexico or
elsewhere have been replaced with vague commitments to retool existing
infrastructure and production lines. <br />
</blockquote>
The resources that could have developed a Model 2 or refreshed the
existing models instead went to develop the
“<a href="https://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2024/04/an-origami-version-of-an-el-camino">Incel
Camino</a>”, the Cybertruck. This isn’t just a $82K laughing-stock, but
a
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/30/opinion/elon-musk-tesla-problems.html">manufacturing
nightmare</a> that will be lucky to sell 20% of Musk’s 250K/year
projection, especially since it cannot be road-legal in either of
Tesla’s #2 and #3 markets (China and EU). It will definitely be a drag
on the results for some time. So the Models S (2012), X (2015), 3 (2017)
and Y (2020) will have to soldier on for a while.<br /> <br /> This
aging product line
<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/485109f3-9118-4d75-a202-58bd2b89da45">isn’t
attracting customers</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
Sequential growth in units sold was down 13 per cent sequentially.
</li>
<li>
Tesla’s price per vehicle, excluding regulatory credits and leasing or
finance income, was $38,924.
</li>
<li>
This was down 13 per cent from $44,642 last year, which itself was down
11 per cent from $50,037 the previous year.
</li>
</ul>
Extreme pricing pressure is forcing affordable vehicles on Tesla,
irrespective of whether it chooses to launch one. Amid a lack of demand
for EVs in general, and Teslas in particular, its quarterly automotive
revenues were down nearly 13 per cent over the past year and by over 19
per cent sequentially.<br /> <br /> “Clean” automotive margins (which
exclude regulatory credits and leasing income) were down from 29.7 per
cent in the first quarter of 2022, to 18.3 per cent in the first quarter
of 2023, and again to 15.6 per cent in the first quarter of 2024. If you
back out the new IRA US tax credits (which Tesla doesn’t seem to
disclose) then automotive gross margin looks to have fallen even
further, to around 14.1 per cent.
</blockquote>
Shrinking margins on shrinking sales hit
<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/485109f3-9118-4d75-a202-58bd2b89da45">earnings
per share</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
GAAP EPS was down 53 per cent year-on-year, accelerating from the 23 per
cent drop in the first quarter of 2023. Even using non-GAAP EPS it’s a
47 per cent decrease over the past year.<br /> <br /> In the summer of
2022, when the stock was above $300 share, analysts were expecting Q1’24
EPS of $1.80. Instead, they got $0.45. That is a 75 per cent downgrade
to expectations.

And the upsell of Fake Self Driving isn’t helping, as Craig Trudell
reports in
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-24/tesla-tsla-keeps-unlocking-less-fsd-software-revenue-than-hoped">Tesla’s
Self-Driving Software Is a Perpetual Revenue Letdown</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Tesla released its 10-Q, a quarterly report that provides a more
detailed view into the company’s financial position. For several years
running, Tesla has provided regular updates in these statements on how
much revenue it’s taken in from customers and not yet fully recognized.
Some of this deferred revenue relates to a work-in-progress product:
Full Self-Driving, or FSD, for short.<br /> <br /> Tesla’s deferred
automotive revenue amounted to $3.5 billion as of March 31, little
changed from the end of last year. Of that amount, Tesla expects to
recognize $848 million in the next 12 months — meaning much of the
performance obligations tied to what it’s been charging customers for
FSD will remain unsatisfied a year from now.<br /> …<br /> In these
filings, Tesla also reports how much deferred revenue it’s actually
recognized — and the Austin-based company has consistently undershot its
own forecasts. It has recognized $494 million of deferred revenue in the
last 12 months, short of the $679 million that it projected a year ago.

Tesla’s CFO
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-26/tesla-s-most-crucial-metric-drops-to-the-lowest-in-three-years">quit
last August</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The carmaker reported this week that its operating margin shrank to 5.5%
in the first quarter, the lowest since the last three months of 2020.
The measure of profitability was at 16% when Zachary Kirkhorn, Tesla’s
then-chief financial officer, said during an earnings call that it was
key to the company.<br /> <br /> “As a management team here, we’re most
focused on what our operating margin is,” he said in January 2023, in
response to an investor question on a different earnings metric. “That
is what we’re primarily managing to now.”
</blockquote>
<a href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/general-motors/operating-margin/">General
Motors operating margin</a> is 7.35%. But not to worry, Tesla isn’t a
car company, its an
<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/485109f3-9118-4d75-a202-58bd2b89da45">AI
and robotics company</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
If the auto business is worth 3 or 4 times the multiple of a Stellantis
or Volkswagen, then it would get a forward PE of, say, 20x. That’s more
than generous for a business the CEO talks about as a legacy
sideline.<br /> <br /> Street numbers for Tesla are consistently far too
high but even using the 2024 consensus EPS of $2.64, Tesla would be
worth just over $50 per share. Using today’s diluted shares (and
assuming that they don’t issue more, which they will) that works out to
a market cap of $181bn.<br /> <br /> Tesla’s fully diluted market cap at
pixel time is still $580bn. Simplistically, that means shareholders are
already paying around $400bn for corporate experiments in “robotics and
AI”, along with anything else Musk has or tries to conjure up.
</blockquote>
Tesla will definitely issue more shares, for example after the
13<sup>th</sup> June shareholder vote when they will reward Musk’s
corporate experiments in robotics and AI by
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/04/tesla-asks-shareholders-to-approve-texas-move-and-restore-elon-musks-56b-pay/">reinstating
the $56B incentive package</a> cancelled by the Delaware court.<br />
<h3>
Pumping The Stock
</h3>
About 70% of the stock price is based on Musk hyping the technology.
Thus for Musk it is more than twice as important to pump the stock as it
is to sell more cars. He has to follow two strategies:<br />
<ul>
<li>
Make the results look better in the short term by increasing margins.
The obvious way to do this is to cut costs, even though this will reduce
profits in the longer term. After all, in the longer term Tesla isn’t
about selling cars, it is about AI and robotics.
</li>
<li>
Distract people from looking at the results by unleashing the hype
cannon.
</li>
</ul>
<h4>
Cutting Costs
</h4>
The knee-jerk reaction of US companies to bad quarterly results is to
lay off staff, but they generally target the less successful parts. Elon
Musk
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/04/tesla-to-lay-off-everyone-working-on-superchargers-new-vehicles/">not
so much</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Even Tesla’s harshest critics must concede that the company’s
Supercharger network is its star asset. Tesla has more fast chargers in
operation than anyone else, and this year
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/02/ford-evs-gain-access-to-tesla-superchargers-starting-today/">opened
them up to other automakers</a>, which are adopting the J3400 plug
standard.<br /> <br /> All of which makes the decision to get rid of
senior director of EV charging Rebecca Tinucci—along with her entire
team—a bit of a head-scratcher. If I were the driver of a non-Tesla EV
expecting to get access to Superchargers this year, I’d probably expect
this to result in some friction. Musk told workers that Tesla “will
continue to build out some new Supercharger locations, where critical,
and finish those currently under construction.”
</blockquote>
Like most of the recent desperation moves, this was
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-30/tesla-axes-supercharger-team-in-blow-to-other-automakers">Musk’s
decision</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The decision to cut the nearly 500-person group, including its senior
director, Rebecca Tinucci, was made by Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk
in the last week, according to a person familiar with the matter.
</blockquote>
In return for gorvenment subsidies, Tesla had been turning Superchargers
into a
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-30/tesla-axes-supercharger-team-in-blow-to-other-automakers">separate
business</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Access to high-speed charging is critical to EV adoption, and Tesla
invested billions of dollars into developing a global network of
Superchargers that became the envy of other automakers. It’s also a
critical driver of Tesla sales, and the carmaker pointed to the
division’s growth during its first-quarter results just last week.<br />
<br /> “Starting at the end of February, we began opening our North
American Supercharger Network to more non-Tesla EV owners,” Tesla said
in its shareholder deck.<br /> <br /> The Musk-led company has also
signed charging partnerships with carmakers including Stellantis NV,
Volvo, Polestar, Kia, Honda, Mercedes-Benz and BMW. It’s not clear who
will now oversee Tesla’s partnerships with those companies. GM, Volvo
and Polestar were all due to open NACS chargers to their customers in
the immediate future, according to Tesla’s website.
</blockquote>
But maybe Musk couldn’t resist a chance to
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-30/tesla-axes-supercharger-team-in-blow-to-other-automakers">mess
with the competition</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The job eliminations mean Rivian, Ford and others have lost their main
points of contact in Tesla’s charging unit shortly before the kickoff of
the busy summer driving season. Tinucci was one of the main executives
building and managing outside partnerships and was thought of highly,
two people who had worked with her inside and outside of Tesla said.

Undercuts Tesla Chargers That Biden Lauded as ‘a Big Deal’</a> by Craig
Trudell suggests a political motive:<br />
<blockquote>
In addition to potentially compromising budding partnerships with other
carmakers looking to tap Tesla’s chargers, another consequence of Musk’s
move may be undercutting Biden’s EV push in the midst of his reelection
campaign. Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump has repeatedly
attacked electric cars on the campaign trail and predicted a
“<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-16/trump-threatens-100-tariffs-on-mexican-made-cars-by-china-firms">bloodbath</a>”
for the auto industry if he isn’t elected.
</blockquote>
Faced with a huge short-term threat to his wealth Musk isn’t concerned
with the longer term, when unlike robotaxis, Superchargers could have
been a
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-01/musk-undercuts-tesla-chargers-biden-had-lauded-as-a-big-deal">nice
little earner</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Tesla had been building a tidy charging business over more than a
decade. BloombergNEF estimates that the company delivered 8% of the
public charging electricity demanded globally last year. Before Musk’s
surprise decision, the researcher was projecting that Tesla’s annual
profit from Supercharging could rise to around
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-04-09/tesla-tsla-charging-network-has-become-a-serious-business">$740
million</a> in 2030.<br /> <br /> That level of earnings is now likely
out of reach, as BNEF’s estimates assumed Tesla would accelerate the
pace of installations through the end of the decade. Musk had given
indications this was the plan.
</blockquote>
Musk may already be having
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-30/tesla-axes-supercharger-team-in-blow-to-other-automakers">second
thoughts</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The move will slow the network’s growth, according to a person familiar
with the division, who asked not to be identified discussing private
matters. There already are discussions about rehiring some of the people
affected in order to operate the existing network and grow it at a much
slower rate, the person said.
</blockquote>
Way to motivate the team, Elon!<br /> <br /> Musk believes the future
depends upon
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/04/tesla-to-lay-off-everyone-working-on-superchargers-new-vehicles/">robotaxis
but</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Many Tesla fans had been holding out hope that Musk would debut a cheap
Model 2 EV in recent weeks. Instead, the tycoon promised that robotaxis
would save the business, even as both of its partially automated driver
assistance systems face recalls and
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/04/feds-concerned-some-of-teslas-autopilot-recall-was-opt-in-reversible/">investigations</a>
here in the US and in
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/05/tesla-china-recall-autopilot">China</a>.<br />
<br /> Delivering on that goal is more than just a technical challenge,
and it will require the cooperation and approval of state and federal
authorities. However, Musk is also dissolving the company’s public
policy team in this latest cull.
</blockquote>
Cutting off communication with the regulators who will have to approve
robotaxi service isn’t likely to help. And if there was another
technology critical to Tesla’s success it would be
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/04/tesla-to-lay-off-everyone-working-on-superchargers-new-vehicles/">batteries</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Earlier this month, Tesla engaged in another round of layoffs
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/04/tesla-to-lay-off-more-than-10-percent-of-its-workers-as-sales-slow/">that
decimated the company</a> and parted ways with longtime executive Drew
Baglino, who was responsible for Tesla’s battery development.
</blockquote>
Jonathan M. Gitlin rounds up reactions in
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/05/chaos-at-tesla-what-analysts-think-about-elon-musks-cuts-and-layoffs/"><i>What’s
happening at Tesla? Here’s what experts think</i></a>. He quotes Ed
Niedermeyer:<br />
<blockquote>
Car companies “go bankrupt because A, they overinvest in factories, and
then demand falls off. Which… that fits the profile,” said Niedermeyer.
“And B, they don’t invest in products. Not investing in products is sort
of a longer-term cause, and the proximal cause is [that] demand falls,
and you’ve been investing in too many factories, and you get crushed by
those fixed costs. So those cases that are common across most auto
industry bankruptcies are certainly there.”<br /> <br /> But with almost
$27 billion of cash on hand, that shouldn’t happen any time soon. “The
thing that is really hard to understand is that if you have tens of
billions of dollars in cash but you’re losing market share and you’re
losing margin, losing pricing power, and all the other things that are
happening with the business—you don’t cut your way out of that problem,”
Niedermeyer continued. “That’s the confusing part about all this. What
would you use that cash for if not to solve those problems? And yet,
instead, they’re cutting.<br /> <br />”One of the things I’ve said for a
really long time, and I think this is what’s happening, is that an
automaker is not really real until they survived a serious downturn,”
Niedermeyer said. And while the broader economy looks fine, EV sales are
battling a strong negative headwind. “The car game is a survival
business. You can capture more upside than the other guy in the good
times. And that can be really good for your stock. But if you do that by
not investing in the things that protect you in the downturn, it doesn’t
matter. And you’re just another one on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_defunct_automobile_manufacturers_of_the_United_States">the
list of defunct automakers</a>,”
</blockquote>

<h4>
Hyping The Technology
</h4>
The <i>Washington Post</i> team’s Faiz Siddiqui and Trisha Thadani
report that
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/04/23/elon-musk-tesla-earnings-outlook/">Tesla
profit plunges on price cuts, but company unveils plans for affordable
models</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
CEO Elon Musk, who has a unique penchant for redirecting the
conversation, used Tuesday’s earnings call to deflect from the poor
numbers, focusing instead on the company’s commitment to artificial
intelligence and a fully autonomous car. Details on Tesla’s apparent new
offerings — which include the “more affordable models” and the
“cybercab” — were scant and did not address how the company would
overcome the technological and regulatory hurdles ahead.`
</blockquote>
Musk has form when it comes to hyping his technologies and companies.
His tweeting that funding had been secured to take Tesla private at
$420/share led to a settlement with the SEC that is
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/apr/29/elon-musk-tweet-tesla-lawyer">still
in place</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The supreme court on Monday rejected an appeal from Elon Musk over a
settlement with securities regulators that requires him to get approval
in advance of some tweets that relate to Tesla, the electric vehicle
company he leads.
</blockquote>
The hype is starting to wear thin but not yet with the markets, as
Brandon Vigliarolo points out in
<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/24/musk_moves_tesla_goalposts_back/"><i>Musk
moves Tesla’s goalposts, investors happily move shares
higher</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Elon Musk has a strategy and you may have seen it before: When things
aren’t going well, he’ll say something wild to take everyone’s eyes off
the trouble, and raise share prices with dreams.<br /> …<br /> The first
quarter of 2024 didn’t go well for Tesla, either economically or
reputationally. As we reported earlier, sales fell, net profit tumbled
off the same cliff Tesla’s stock price earlier careened over, and
production and deliveries decreased as well. <br /> <br /> But give Musk
a chance to toss out a flash grenade and he’ll do just that: This time
around with some wild predictions about his automaker producing a
“purpose-built robotaxi” dubbed the “Cybercab,” and Tesla’s latest
vision for the future as one in which it is focused on “solving
autonomy.” <br /> …<br /> “It’s like some combination of Airbnb and
Uber, meaning that there will be some number of cars that Tesla owns
itself and operates in the fleet … and then there’ll be a bunch of cars
where they’re owned by the end user,” Musk said. He added the fleet will
likely grow to include “several tens of millions” of vehicles by the end
of the decade.
</blockquote>
Last year Tesla shipped
<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/502208/tesla-quarterly-vehicle-deliveries/">1.8M
vehicles</a>. There are 6 years left to the “end of the decade”. Musk is
promising to ship an average of at least 3M vehicles/year, <i>all</i> of
which would be enrolled in the robotaxi fleet. Even if this were
plausible, one has to question where all the riders would come from for
a fleet
<a href="https://www.ridester.com/how-many-uber-drivers-are-there/">2.5
times bigger than Uber’s global driver list</a>. Note that in the US
<a href="https://www.ridester.com/how-many-uber-drivers-are-there/">36%
of adults</a> have used Uber or Lyft, so the market is already close to
saturated. I’m sure we all

Musk spent plenty of time in the 2010s claiming he’d have one million
robotaxis on the road by 2020.

Pumping the stock full of hype is a

habit</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Getting in trouble over “Full-Self Driving” claims? Stick a guy in a

calling him out on his nonsense? Rant about the “woke mind virus” and
the media on Twitter.<br /> <br /> Of course, Optimus has been nowhere
to be seen and was barely mentioned during the call. Likewise, Tesla’s
dreams of tens of millions of robotaxis on the road in the next six
years rests on the need for serious technological breakthroughs the
automaker has failed to make despite years of trying. Oh, and a ton of
permits if this is to operate in the States, at least.

Vigliarolo isn’t alone. In

Sells the Tesla Dream, But Don’t Ask for Details</i></a> Liam Denning
notices a detail from the earnings call:<br />
<blockquote>
There was an odd tweak to the low-cost vehicle strategy Tesla laid out
in March 2023, when management talked about cutting costs in half with
revolutionary manufacturing methods. Now, Tesla talks about melding
aspects of next-generation platforms with its existing ones in the new
models, enabling the company to build them on existing manufacturing
lines. To be clear, that is an intriguing possibility, offering
efficiencies to reduce stubborn costs.<br /> <br /> But also to be
clear: It won’t deliver a $25,000 Model 2 anytime soon — “this update
may result in achieving less cost reduction than previously expected” —
and also isn’t what Tesla talked about only a year or so ago. It is a
major overhaul of strategy requiring details. <br />
</blockquote>
Tesla is starting to have
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-24/tesla-tsla-can-musk-s-robotaxi-dream-help-ev-maker-fix-its-troubles">serious
competition</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
So consumers — some of whom are turned off by Musk’s incessant posting
on X, the social platform he owns, and by his controversial political
comments — have a lot of choices when it comes to buying an electric
car. Tesla’s share of the EV market in the US was roughly 51% in the
first quarter, Cox says, down from almost 62% a year earlier.<br />
<br /> The competition is even fiercer outside the US, where Chinese
carmakers dominate. About half of all EVs sold globally are Chinese
brands — BYD, the top brand within China, sold more cars than Tesla did
in the last quarter of 2023, though Tesla regained the lead in the
following quarter.
</blockquote>
To respond to this competition, Tesla has understood for a long time
that they
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-24/tesla-tsla-can-musk-s-robotaxi-dream-help-ev-maker-fix-its-troubles">needed
a $25K Model 2</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Musk first teased about such a car in September 2020, saying a series of
innovations Tesla was working on would enable it to make an EV at that
price within about three years. As recently as January, Musk said Tesla
was “very far along” with work on its lower-cost vehicle.<br />
</blockquote>
But as always, Musk’s schedule was just a fantasy, and then the need to
pump the stock
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-24/tesla-tsla-can-musk-s-robotaxi-dream-help-ev-maker-fix-its-troubles">took
over</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Then, in early April, Reuters reported that Tesla had shelved plans for
the cheaper vehicle to prioritize its robotaxi, creating bedlam among
investors. The tension within Tesla over Musk’s desire to focus on the
robotaxi is nothing new. It was chronicled by Walter Isaacson, who wrote
in his book published in September that the billionaire had “repeatedly
vetoed” plans to make a less-expensive model. Musk refused to give any
details about a new, more-affordable model when asked about them by
analysts on the first-quarter call.
</blockquote>
My guess is that it has dawned on Tesla that, without the resources sunk
into the Cybertruck, they simply can’t build a $25K car and make money,
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-24/tesla-tsla-can-musk-s-robotaxi-dream-help-ev-maker-fix-its-troubles">unlike
the competition</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
China’s EV advantage is in batteries — the most expensive part of an EV.
They’re much cheaper in China because of the country’s control of the
mining and processing of component materials such as lithium, cobalt,
manganese and rare earth metals. UBS analysts say BYD had a 25% cost
advantage over North American and European brands in 2023. Its cheapest
model goes for $10,000. Tesla’s cheapest Model Y — the world’s
best-selling car of any kind last year — is about $35,000 in the US
after accounting for federal tax credits.
</blockquote>
China’s other advantage is in
<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-cant-solve-teslas-china-crisis-with-his-desperate-asia-visit/">driver
assistance technology</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
“Chinese EVs are simply evolving at a far faster pace than Tesla,”
agrees Shanghai-based automotive journalist and WIRED contributor Mark
Andrews, who tested the driver assistance tech available on the roads in
China. The US-listed trio of Xpeng, Nio, and Li Auto offer
better-than-Tesla “driving assistance features” that rely heavily on
lidar sensors, a technology that Musk previously dismissed, but which
Tesla is now said to be testing.<br />
</blockquote>
<h3>
The Robotaxi Rescue
</h3>
According to Musk the thing that will transform Tesla’s profitability is
a robotaxi. Lets assume for the moment that, despite being dependent
only upon cameras, Tesla’s Fake Self Driving actually worked. In
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2023/11/robotaxi-economics.html"><i>Robotaxi
Economics</i></a> I analyzed the <i>New York Times’</i> reporting on
Waymo and Cruise robotaxis in San Francisco and concluded:<br />
<blockquote>
These numbers look even worse for Tesla. Last year Matthew Loh reported
that
<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-tesla-worth-basically-zero-without-self-driving-2022-6i"><i>Elon
Musk says the difference between Tesla being ‘worth a lot of money or
worth basically zero’ all comes down to solving self-driving
technology</i></a>, and the reason was that owners would rent out their
Teslas as robotaxis when they weren’t using them. This was always
obviously a stupid idea; who wants drunkards home-bound from the pub
throwing up on their Tesla’s seats? But the fact that the numbers don’t
add up for robotaxis in general, and the fact that
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/27/23934691/hertz-tesla-uber-ev-plans-damage-repair-price-cutsi"><i>Hertz
is scaling back its EV ambitions because its Teslas keep getting
damaged</i></a> because half of them are being used by Uber drivers as
taxis, make the idea even more laughable.
</blockquote>
Even for Waymo, it turns out that replacing a low-wage human with a lot
of very expensive technology (Waymo’s robotaxis
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/21/technology/waymo-driverless-cars-san-francisco.html">“are
worth as much as $200,000”</a>), and higher-paid
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/03/technology/cruise-general-motors-self-driving-cars.html">support
staff</a> isn’t a path to profitability.<br /> <br /> It is true that
Tesla’s robotaxis would be cheaper than Waymo’s, since they won’t have
the lidar and radar and so on. But these things are what make the
difference between Waymo’s safety record, which is good enough that
regulators allow them to carry passengers, and Tesla’s safety record,
which is unlikely to impress the regulators.<br /> <br /> The regulators
have a lot of reasons to be skeptical. Back in 2021 they started
<a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/us-opens-formal-probe-tesla-autopilot_n_611a651de4b0f7bc26a7eef4">investigating
Autopilot</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The U.S. government has opened a formal investigation into Tesla’s
Autopilot partially automated driving system after a series of
collisions with parked emergency vehicles.<br /> …<br /> NHTSA says it
has identified 11 crashes since 2018 in which Teslas on Autopilot or
Traffic Aware Cruise Control have hit vehicles at scenes where first
responders have used flashing lights, flares, an illuminated arrow board
or cones warning of hazards.
</blockquote>
Since then the evidence has piled up, as the
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/04/28/tesla-trial-autopilot-lawsuit/"><i>Washington
Post</i> team report</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
At least eight lawsuits headed to trial in the coming year — including
two that haven’t been previously reported — involve fatal or otherwise
serious crashes that occurred while the driver was allegedly relying on
Autopilot. The complaints argue that Tesla exaggerated the capabilities
of the feature, which controls steering, speed and other actions
typically left to the driver. As a result, the lawsuits claim, the
company created a false sense of complacency that led the drivers to
tragedy.
</blockquote>
Musk claimed they would never settle these cases,
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/04/28/tesla-trial-autopilot-lawsuit/">but</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Tesla this month settled a high-profile case in Northern California that
claimed Autopilot played a role in the fatal crash of an Apple engineer,
Walter Huang. The company’s decision to settle with Huang’s family —
along with a ruling from a Florida judge concluding that Tesla had
“knowledge” that its technology was “flawed” under certain conditions —
is giving fresh momentum to cases once seen as long shots, legal experts
said.
</blockquote>
The regulators move slowly but they
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/04/28/tesla-trial-autopilot-lawsuit/">keep
moving</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Meanwhile, federal regulators appear increasingly sympathetic to claims
that Tesla oversells its technology and misleads drivers. Even the
decision to call the software Autopilot “elicits the idea of drivers not
being in control” and invites “drivers to overly trust the automation,”
NHTSA said Thursday, revealing that a two-year investigation into
Autopilot had identified 467 crashes linked to the technology, 13 of
them fatal.
</blockquote>
Last December, the NHTSA forced Tesla to
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/12/more-than-2-million-teslas-are-being-recalled-due-to-unsafe-autopilot/">recall
more than 2M vehicles</a> because Autopilot:<br />
<blockquote>
has inadequate driver monitoring and that the system could lead to
“foreseeable misuse,”
</blockquote>
The agency suspects the
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-26/tesla-autopilot-crashes-lead-to-probe-over-adequacy-of-recall">recall
wasn’t adequate</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
<a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2024/INOA-RQ24009-12046.pdf">disclosed</a>

<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-13/tesla-autopilot-recall-2-million-cars-need-software-fix">recall</a>
Tesla conducted in December. The agency is concerned as to whether the
company’s remedy was sufficient, in part due to 20 crashes that have
occurred involving vehicles that received Tesla’s over-the-air software
update.
</blockquote>
The recall involved an over-the-air update, but Tesla’s attitude to
regulation
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/04/feds-concerned-some-of-teslas-autopilot-recall-was-opt-in-reversible/">showed
through</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
the agency writes that “Tesla has stated that a portion of the remedy
both requires the owner to opt in and allows a driver to readily reverse
it” and wants to know why subsequent updates have addressed problems
that should have been fixed with the December recall.
</blockquote>
What is the point of a safety recall that is opt-in and reversible?
Clearly, it is to avoid denting the credibility of the hype. The NHTSA
is
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-26/tesla-autopilot-crashes-lead-to-probe-over-adequacy-of-recall">not
happy</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
In a
<a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2022/INCLA-EA22002-14498.pdf">separate
filing</a>, NHTSA detailed findings from its investigation that preceded
the December recall. The agency found that Autopilot didn’t sufficiently
ensure drivers stayed engaged in the task of driving, and that Autopilot
invited drivers to be overconfident in the system’s capabilities. Those
factors led to foreseeable misuse and avoidable crashes, at least 13 of
which involved one or more fatalities, according to the report.<br />
<br /> “Tesla’s weak driver-engagement system was not appropriate for
Autopilot’s permissive operating capabilities,” NHTSA said. This
resulted in a “critical safety gap” between drivers’ expectations and
the system’s actual capabilities, according to the agency.
</blockquote>
The NHTSA is skeptical that the
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/05/nhtsa-wants-autopilot-answers-from-tesla-after-20-post-recall-crashes/">recall
was effective</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
But NHTSA says it knows of at least 20 crashes involving Tesla Autopilot
that fall into three different categories. It says there have been nine
cases of a Tesla having a frontal collision with another vehicle,
object, or person, for which there was time for an alert driver to have
avoided the crash. Another six crashes occurred when Teslas operating
under Autopilot lost control and spun out or understeered into something
in a low-grip environment. And five more crashes occurred when the
driver inadvertently canceled the steering component of Autopilot
without disengaging the adaptive cruise control.<br /> <br /> NHTSA also
says it tested the post-recall system at its Vehicle Research and Test
Center in Ohio and that it “was unable to identify a difference in the
initiation of the driver warning cascade between pre-remedy and
post-remedy (camera obscured) conditions,” referring to the supposedly
stronger driver monitoring.
</blockquote>
The agency is giving Tesla
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-26/tesla-autopilot-crashes-lead-to-probe-over-adequacy-of-recall">until
July 1<sup>st</sup></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
to send NHTSA a lot of data, including a database with information for
every car it has sold or leased in the US, with information on the
number and dates of all Autopilot driver warnings, disengagements, and
suspensions for each of those vehicles. (There are currently more than 2
million Teslas on the road in the US.)<br /> <br /> Tesla must also
provide the cumulative mileage covered by Autopilot, both before and
after the recall. NHTSA wants Tesla to explain why it filed an official
Part 573 Safety Recall Notice, “including all supporting engineering and
safety assessment evidence.” NHTSA also wants to know why any non-recall
update was not part of the recall in the first place.
</blockquote>
Finally, Mike Spector and Chris Prentice report that
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-autopilot-probe-us-prosecutors-focus-securities-wire-fraud-2024-05-08/"><i>In
Tesla Autopilot probe, US prosecutors focus on securities, wire

<blockquote>
U.S. prosecutors are examining whether Tesla committed securities or
wire fraud by misleading investors and consumers about its electric

matter told Reuters.<br /> …<br /> Reuters exclusively reported the

communications, by misleading consumers about its driver-assistance
systems, the sources said. They are also examining whether Tesla
committed securities fraud by deceiving investors, two of the sources
said.<br /> <br /> The Securities and Exchange Commission is also
investigating Tesla’s representations about driver-assistance systems to
investors, one of the people said.
</blockquote>
This is all about Autopilot, but Fake Self Driving has problems too, as
the <i>Washington Post</i> team reported in
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2024/tesla-full-self-driving-fatal-crash/"><i>Tesla
worker killed in fiery crash may be first ‘Full Self-Driving’
fatality</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Two years ago, a Tesla shareholder tweeted that there “has not been one
accident or injury” involving Full Self-Driving, to which Musk
responded: “Correct.” But if that was accurate at the time, it no longer
appears to be so. A Tesla driver who caused an eight-car pileup with
multiple injuries on the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge in 2022 told
police he was using Full Self-Driving. And The Post has linked the
technology to at least two serious crashes, including the one that
killed von Ohain.
</blockquote>
The regulators still approve Waymo’s cautious and well-engineered
robotaxi effort. Uber’s and Cruise’s robotaxi efforts flamed out. Given
the lack of sensors, the history of crashes, the fact that their
“autonomy” technology is still at level 2, and the resistance to
regulation, why would any regulator approve even the testing, let alone
the revenue service of a Tesla robotaxi?
<h3>
After Robotaxis, What?
</h3>
Now that the effectiveness of the robotaxi hype is starting to fade, it
is time for Musk to roll out the next shiny object. Dan Robinson reports
on it in
<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/30/tesla_ai_workloads/">Elon
Musk’s latest brainfart is to turn Tesla cars into AWS on
wheels</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
EV carmaker Tesla is considering a wonderful money-making wheeze – use
all of that compute power in its vehicles to process workloads for cash,
like a kind of AWS on wheels.<br /> <br /> The Elon Musk-led outfit said
in its recent
<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/24/tesla_q1_2024/">earnings
conference</a> call for calendar Q1 that it had noticed its vehicles
spend a considerable amount of their time just sitting there not moving.
Many pack in a decent amount of processing power, so why not get them to
do something useful and earn some cash for the company as well?<br />
<br /> Speaking on the conference call, Musk said that he thought most
Teslas were probably used for about a third of the hours in a
week.<br />
</blockquote>
Seriously? Unless you’re a gig worker for Uber or Lyft, who clocks 56
hours/week sitting behind the wheel? I can’t believe that Musk is
<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/30/tesla_ai_workloads/">under-estimating
the potential here</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
“And now that we have already paid for this compute in these cars, it
might be wise to use them and not let them be, like, buying a lot of
expensive machinery and leaving to them idle. We don’t want that. We
want to use the computer as much as possible and close to like basically
100 percent of the time to make full use of it,” Elluswamy said.<br />
<br /> “It takes a lot of intelligence to drive the car anyway. And when
it’s not driving the car, you just put this intelligence to other uses,
solving scientific problems like a human or answering dumb questions for
someone else,” he added.<br /> …<br /> “If you get, like, to the 100
million vehicle level, which I think we will at some point get to, and
you’ve got a kilowatt of usable compute – I think you could have on the
order of 100 gigawatts of useful compute, which might be more than
anyone, more than any company, probably more than any company,” he
mused.<br />
</blockquote>
Tesla is currently selling around 2M vehicles/year, so “at some point”
will be sometime in the 2070s, by which time the vast majority of the
vehicles Tesla has shipped will have been scrapped, and even if they
still work 50 years of Moore’s law will have made all but the last few
obsolete.<br /> <br /> Robinson starts
<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/30/tesla_ai_workloads/">thinking
about the details</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Of course, all this compute capacity isn’t sitting conveniently
clustered together in a datacenter. It is distributed here and there,
reached via a cellular connection in each Tesla, or possibly via Wi-Fi
if the car is on the owner’s driveway.<br /> <br /> So the model Tesla
would be looking at is perhaps more akin to edge computing, such as
<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/01/12/heata_offers_free_hot_water/">Heata</a>
in the UK, which uses heat from servers in homes to provide domestic hot
water and rents out the compute capacity via cloud company Civo.<br />
<br /> Among the issues we can see is that Tesla would be effectively
using electricity that the car owner has paid for to run any workloads
while it is idle, so would they get a cut of the money generated?<br />
<br /> Yes, it seems. CFO Vaibhav Taneja, said “the capex is shared by
the entire world. Sort of everyone owns a small chunk, and they get a
small profit out of it maybe.”<br /> …<br /> IDC Senior Research
Director for Digital Infrastructure Andrew Buss said the idea sounds
technically feasible, but the potential downsides are perhaps too big to
justify it being actually implemented.<br /> <br /> “They’d not even be
edge processing nodes as the code and data would have to be centrally
managed and stored and then packaged and sent for processing before
being returned once complete,” he told The Register.<br /> <br /> Other
downsides include third-party code and data running on a private asset,
Buss said, and if taking power from the battery, this would accelerate
the degradation of these, which are the single most expensive and
crucial part of a Tesla and need to be kept in as optimal a shape as
possible for longevity and consistency of range.<br /> <br /> In other
words, Tesla might well find that implementing this idea may prove more
trouble than it is actually worth for the returns it generates.<br />
<br /> And as The Register
<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/24/musk_moves_tesla_goalposts_back/">noted</a>
after the earnings conference, Elon has a habit of throwing out wild
ideas when things aren’t going well to distract the punters and energize
investors. This could well be one of them.

<h2 id="i-bought-a-steam-deck">I Bought a Steam Deck</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-09, from: Jessica Smith’s blog</p>
<p>
A couple of days I posted about
<a href="https://www.jayeless.net/2024/05/getting-back-into-the-sims-games.html">wanting
to get back into The Sims (2 &amp; 4)</a>. What I didn’t mention then,
that I will now, is I’d kinda been wanting to get back into casual
gaming already. I’ve never been a real Gamer™ exactly, but I have
purchased a bunch of indie games through Steam and itch.io over the
years, and spent a fair bit of time… you know… casually gaming. For the
most part I like turn-based
<abbr title="Role-Playing Games">RPGs</abbr>, simulation games, and the
occasional puzzle game. Nothing with too grim or dreary an atmosphere.
And, of course, I’ve only really played games on computers (well, and
the occasional mobile game, I guess). My parents never let us have a
gaming console growing up, and with my disability it’s too hard to use a
controller anyway – my right hand just isn’t dexterous enough to operate
its side of the controls.
</p>
<p>
When I was playing a lot of indie games between about 2018–2020, I
mostly did so on a desktop computer, running Linux. Not only did a ton
of indie games support Linux natively, but Steam rolled out an embedded
implementation of Wine called Proton, so most games <em>without</em>
official Linux versions worked on Linux, too. I mean, in 2017 I’d been
using PlayOnLinux to play <cite>The Sims 4</cite>, so I already knew
Wine wasn’t too bad by that time, but I guess Steam’s real triumph was
in rolling the compatibility layer into the client, moving a lot of the
hassle behind the scenes and out of the player’s way. Even though I
haven’t been playing games so much since 2020, as I understand it,
Proton has just got better and smoother ever since, such that these days
the only games that really don’t work with it are always-online
multiplayer games with kernel-level anticheat, which I don’t play,
anyway. At any rate, even five years ago, life as a Linux-using indie
gamer was good.
</p>
<p>
<em>But</em>, time passes. I stopped being able to use that desktop so
much when a) the monitor broke and, because it was within warranty, I
spent a couple of months working through the warranty process with the
retailer instead of just buying a new one; and b) Viv started working
from home a lot when the Covid pandemic began, and commandeered that
desk and computer for himself. I started using a MacBook Air as my
primary computer, and switching back and forth between it and the
desktop was a bit of a hassle, and since the only thing the desktop was
really <em>better</em> for was playing games, I just… stopped doing that
so much. I could still play a number of games on the Mac anyway… just
not the more demanding ones, but also not the ones <em>so</em>
undemanding that they only had 32-bit versions, and definitely not the
ones that lack native Mac versions. (There’s no equivalent of Proton for
Mac.) But a few games, sure.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, getting to the Steam Deck. It had been playing on my mind for a
while that I really did have this backlog of games that I should
probably work through at some point. The desktop has become really
inconvenient to use (and as I mentioned in the Sims post, its Linux
install is currently not even working properly, for reasons I have not
been able to work out), and my MacBook Air isn’t designed for gaming.
I’d kind of presumed that the eventual answer would be to buy
<em>another</em> Linux computer – preferably a laptop, for the
portability – but a gaming laptop is like AUD$3000 and not even really
very portable and honestly I didn’t even <em>want</em> a whole new
computer, just a gaming device, and then one day the obvious answer
finally hit me… a Steam Deck. Duh!
</p>
<p>
Valve, for some reason, has declined to sell Steam Decks in Australia,
but you can easily buy grey-imported ones. Last week, after about a
month of dithering, I took the plunge and ordered one – one of the new
OLED screen ones, with 512GB storage space. Today, it arrived!

<p>
There are a number of reasons I think the Steam Deck is a very exciting
device. Firstly, it’s purpose-built to make it really easy to just pick
up and jump straight into a game, suspend and resume as needed, etc..
It’s all the convenience of picking up your phone to scroll social
media, except doing something that is actually fun instead of
doomscrolling social media. You can use it easily on the couch (well,
maybe not if your cat is as obsessed with sitting on your lap as mine,
but in theory). It’s just like… if one of the biggest obstacles to me
working through my game backlog is the <em>hassle</em>, the Steam Deck
should really help with that.
</p>
<p>
Secondly, it offers a lot of different ways to control your games
(D-pad, joysticks, A/B/X/Y buttons, trackpads, a touchscreen, bumper
buttons…) and <strong>they are all reconfigurable</strong>! There is
<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2804823261">a
very detailed guide on the Steam Community

Like I mentioned in my introduction paragraph, I’ve never been able to
play with a video game controller and I wanted to make sure I wasn’t
going to have any accessibility issues with the Steam Deck. Well, I’m
not sure it’d enable me to play the kinds of fast-paced action games or
high-precision platformers that I don’t feel able to play already, but
you can totally do things like tell the D-pad to work as A/B/X/Y and use
the left joystick for directions so you can control a game entirely from
the left side of the device. No problem. Plus, with any game that’s
designed to work entirely with a mouse, you can just use the
touchscreen. I think it’s really cool just how customisable the Deck is
in this regard.
</p>
<p>
And <em>thirdly</em>, I love the fact that the Steam Deck is really just
a Linux computer under the hood, after all. If you remember my post
about the Sims the other day, and how miffed I was that I couldn’t play
my copy of <cite>The Sims 2 Ultimate Collection</cite> on my Mac, you’ll
be pleased to hear that one <strong>can</strong> play it on the Steam
Deck. There is

which links to another, seemingly more detailed, guide on YouTube. The
process isn’t quite as easy as “find game in Steam store, purchase,
install” of course, but it’s doable! You can also use your Steam Deck to
play games from other online stores like itch.io or GOG, you can connect
to most providers of cloud storage you might use to share data
painlessly with your other computers, and you can install and use other
software beyond games – pretty much anything available on Linux. You can
connect peripherals like a keyboard, external monitor and mouse/touchpad
and play like on a more traditional computer if you want. It’s very
flexible. And much, much cheaper than a gaming laptop 😁
</p>
<p>
At approx. AUD$1,075, it was still a bit of a splurge, but I haven’t
treated myself to any “new shinies” since 2020, and honestly I’m excited
to get into this thing. Let’s see how it goes!

</h1>
<p>
<a class="account" href="https://chirp.enworld.org/@taichara" title="@taichara@chirp.enworld.org"><span
class="citation" data-cites="taichara">@taichara</span></a> pointed me
to a blog post that Creative Commons (CC) wrote in 2023 about the court
cases against GitHub, Stable Diffusion, Midjourney and the claim that
their use of copyrighted works to train the machines is copyright
infringement. CC does not agree.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
As Creative Commons has argued elsewhere, and others agree, I believe
that this type of use should be protected by copyright’s fair use
doctrine. In this blog post I will discuss what fair use is, what
purpose it serves, and why I believe that using copyrighted works to
train generative AI models should be permitted under this law. –
<a href="https://creativecommons.org/2023/02/17/fair-use-training-generative-ai/">Fair
Use: Training Generative AI</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I guess I don’t mind that blog post. For one, Fair Use is a very USA
thing and I don’t live there. Furthermore, the CC licenses don’t say
“this material is fine for AI training” – so whether this is fine or not
will be decided by the courts. I would only worry if CC turns out to be
working on a version 5 of their licenses with an explicit exception for
AI training. And even then, we can keep on using version 4 of the
license. There is no automatic upgrade option.
</p>
<p>
This is why I feel fine.
</p>
<p>
Imagine the Dude from The Big Lebowski saying, “Yeah, well, that’s just,
like, their opinion…”
</p>
<p>
It doesn’t look as if CC will be changing the license. The courts still
get to decide. If the courts decide in favour of free-for-all AI
training, then rich people win for the moment. But even then, we can
still nationalise their businesses, or prohibit AI training, or raise
prices on electricity and water. The fight isn’t over. Not by a long
shot.
</p>
<p>
Maybe this is a thing with lawyers. We trust people who share our values
and we’d trust somebody when they write something along the lines of “AI
training is terrible and AI use is dubious but what can you do, it’s in
the hand of the courts, we certainly don’t support it.” But lawyers
trust other lawyers who say “we’ll see what the courts say but our
understanding is that nobody should stop AI training because that’s the
trade-off copyright makes and we support people and corporations
exercising their rights.”
</p>
<p>
The apparent moral support on copyright grounds is revolting, but this
approach seems typical to me. They say: The point of the law is this or
that. We say: The result of these actions is bad for society and bad for
the climate. They are externalising all the costs. The artists and
authors who want to produce new works are losing their jobs. The people
double-checking the computers and their training are burning out. The
communities where these corporations build their computing centres
suffer from water scarcity because the water is used to cool the
computers. The countries where these corporations build their computing
centres need to build more power plants because so much electricity is
required to train their models. The move to renewable energies is
delayed. Phasing out nuclear power is delayed and more radioactive waste
ends up on our lands.
</p>

a powerful culture. This place is not a place of honor… no highly
esteemed deed is commemorated here… nothing valued is here. –
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_nuclear_waste_warning_messages">Long-term

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
And what for? The people who are looking for answers get served bullshit
slop that’s wrong and hurtful and racist and misogynist. We see this in
customer service degrading, in search engines degrading, in websites
degrading. The corporations don’t mind that they’re feeding us slop as
long as they are making money.
</p>
<p>
We are enabling this because these corporations are powerful and rich.
They buy our politicians with money and promises of jobs, they don’t pay
the taxes they ought to pay and then they don’t deliver on the jobs, and
the jobs they offer are menial and subservient when we’d prefer to be
creative and free. We thought we’d be writing and painting all day while
the machines serve us but we end up serving them while they do the
writing and painting, badly!
</p>
<p>
It’s hard to defend against these corporations because the knowledge
required to defeat them is not known to us all. We don’t read about it
in the media. Instead, they volunteer for all the posts, offer their
experts, pay for their own research, write their own glowing press
releases and commission promising reports. This is how regulatory
capture works.
</p>
<p>
So yes, we should nationalise them, regulate them, force them to pay for
the true cost of resources they use, outlaw their energy waste, force
them to label their output, shun them. We should kick them from our
company. Like a creeping disease their rot spreads, destroying the
technology we built, the search engines, databases, websites, turning it
all into AI slop. It is revolting.
</p>
<p>
And maybe copyright is not the right tool to stop corporations from
training their machines on our works. But in the big picture, they are
still wrong.
</p>
<p>
<a class="account" href="https://social.coop/@eloquence" title="@eloquence@social.coop"><span
class="citation" data-cites="eloquence">@eloquence</span></a> says:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The folks who are calling such training “theft” might regret what they
seem to be implicitly asking for, i.e. much stricter copyright.
Copyright law won’t prevent Microsoft, Google, OpenAI or Adobe from
making shady licensing deals, but they’ll prevent the free/open
community from keeping up.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It’s true, I don’t want to ask for stricter copyright. But I still
oppose all the things that are wrong with the current AI bubble.
</p>
<p>
<a class="account" href="https://mastodon.social/@mcc" title="@mcc@mastodon.social"><span
class="citation" data-cites="mcc">@mcc</span></a> recently wrote about a
similar thing: We use free software licenses in order to distribute our
software for the benefit of our fellow humans but not necessarily to
train the machines of corporations that are responsible for all the
slop.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Like, heck, how am I <em>supposed</em> to rely on my code getting
preserved after I lose interest, I die, BitBucket deletes every bit of
Mercurial-hosted content it ever hosted, etc? Am I supposed to rely on
<em>Microsoft</em> to responsibly preserve my work? Holy crud no. We
<em>want</em> people to want their code widely mirrored and distributed.
That was the reason for the licenses. That was the social contract. But
if machine learning means the social contract is dead, why would people
want their code mirrored? –
<a href="https://mastodon.social/@mcc/112209218607258564">mmc</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
We’re using copyright to keep the software free. If AI regurgitating our
software from its impenetrable memories circumvents copyright it also
circumvents our licenses and therefore pulls the claws and teeth free
software has to fight for its freedom.
</p>
<p>
This is why opposing the current AI bubble is important. No matter how I
look at it, the big picture shows that this kind of AI is our enemy.
</p>
<p>
This is why we continue fighting all the negatives these corporations
bring to the table. And if it turns out that their business model
doesn’t work unless they bring all these negatives to the table, then I
guess that’s just that. We are under no obligation to support their
business model. In fact, it is our right and our duty to regulate the
world in order to improve it for all of us. We’ve been doing it for a
very long time.
</p>
<p>
Here’s to hoping for the next AI winter.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
In the history of artificial intelligence, an AI winter is a period of
reduced funding and interest in artificial intelligence research. The
field has experienced several hype cycles, followed by disappointment
and criticism, followed by funding cuts, followed by renewed interest
years or even decades later. –

free idea for Apple that might boost their stock price. I use the
<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/voice-memos/id1069512134">Voice
Memo app</a> to take notes while I’m programming. Sometimes I talk for
as much as fifteen minutes, because I ramble a lot, but I figure stuff
out this way. I’m sure at some point the Voice Memo app will do
automatic transcripts, I wish it did now. When I finish a memo, a few
minutes or seconds later, there’s an email waiting for me with the text
of the memo. Now here’s how they boost the stock price. They also
provide an <i>edited</i> version of the memo, without repetition and
rambling, and sidebars (they can be treated as sidebars, and appear at
the end). I understand that
<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/">$AAPL</a> is depressed
because the lack of an
<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-missing-ai-hype-140002045.html">AI
story</a>. Here’s a use that every stock trader will understand
immediately. Huge value. I’m sure others are doing it. But Apple has the
high ground. All kinds of services could be attached. I could, in the
middle of my ramble, order a product from Amazon. Or send an email to my
doctor to schedule a new appointment. (Disclaimer: I’ve owned a bunch of
Apple stock since the mid-90s, so I stand to profit if they do it and
I’m right.)</p>

a dice pool roll where a result of 5 or 6 on a six-sided die is a
success.

<p>
The <a href="https://anydice.com/program/36526">answer</a>:

<pre><code>function: ROLL:s count fives and above {

loop N over {1..10} {

<p>date: 2024-05-07, updated: 2024-05-07, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
This
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/05/novel-attack-against-virtually-all-vpn-apps-neuters-their-entire-purpose/">attack</a>
has been feasible for over two decades:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Researchers have devised an attack against nearly all virtual private
network applications that forces them to send and receive some or all
traffic outside of the encrypted tunnel designed to protect it from
snooping or tampering.
</p>
<p>
TunnelVision, as the researchers have named their attack, largely
negates the entire purpose and selling point of VPNs, which is to
encapsulate incoming and outgoing Internet traffic in an encrypted
tunnel and to cloak the user’s IP address. The researchers believe it
affects all VPN applications when they’re connected to a hostile network
and that there are no ways to prevent such attacks except when the
user’s VPN runs on Linux or Android. They also said their attack
technique may have been possible since 2002 and may already have been
discovered and used in the wild since then…

Raspberry Pi today launched
<a href="https://connect.raspberrypi.com">Raspberry Pi Connect</a>, a
free remote VPN service for all Pi OS users.
</p>
<p>
If you create a <a href="https://id.raspberrypi.com/">Raspberry Pi

a Pi 4 or 5 running 64-bit Pi OS 12 ‘Bookworm’, and register that Pi
with the service.
</p>
<p>
Then, on any other device’s web browser, you can log in and remote
control your Pi through Connect’s web-based VNC viewer.

The VNC server is based on

service allows for as many registered Pis as you want (though I’m
guessing the interface is optimized for the majority use case of one or
a few).

it. My comment: “I didn’t know he had been a blogger. So my respect for
him went up dramatically in an instant, and in another instant,
plummeted. What’s wrong with people?” Bad news for Ben, he’s still is a
blogger, btw, in his heart. I can tell. And true journalists and true

Games</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-07, from: Jessica Smith’s blog</p>
<p>
Over the past couple of weeks, I’ve felt this rising tide of nostalgia
building up in me and urging me to revisit the <cite>Sims</cite> games.
I used to be an avid player of <cite>The Sims 2</cite> in the late 2000s
and early 2010s, playing legacy challenges (where you strive to play the
same family over 10 generations) and participating in the thriving
LiveJournal Sims community of the era. Around the time this nostalgic
impulse started, I stumbled upon a corner of Reddit where people are
still talking about, and playing, <cite>The Sims 2</cite>, and that in
turn got me sucked into YouTube videos such as
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpEVeAeyWJHOpjr8FOkf7WTwB5YrNJ8VX">Tanic

on the scourge of hood corruption, and how many of the things Simmers
long thought cause it actually don’t.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, it made me really want to play <cite>The Sims 2</cite> again. I
do actually own the Ultimate Collection via
<abbr title="Electronic Arts">EA</abbr> Origin, but there was a slight
problem… the computer I use is a Mac. And we do have a Linux desktop as
well, and these days Wine/Proton/etc. is so good that
<abbr title="The Sims 2">TS2</abbr> can easily be played on that
<abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr> now… but somehow that install
of Linux got borked and only works in recovery mode, which is sufficient
to run the Plex server I mainly use that desktop for these days, but not
really good enough for <abbr title="The Sims 2">TS2</abbr>. Alas.
</p>
<p>
Another option would have been to purchase Aspyr’s Mac port – the Super
Collection – for AUD$50 in the App Store. I do want to admit that in
principle (even though I already own the game on another platform) this
seems like a worthy option. Unlike
<abbr title="Electronic Arts">EA</abbr>, Aspyr has actually put the
effort in to keep their port updated for new versions of Mac OS,
including upgrading the game to 64 bits when Apple dropped support for
32-bit applications, and updating the game again to run natively on
Apple Silicon (the M1 chips and beyond). That’s great and they deserve
to be supported for that! My reasons for not just choosing that option
are a bit on the selfish and picky side. Firstly,
<abbr title="Electronic Arts">EA</abbr> never allowed Aspyr to port the
last couple of expansion packs (<cite>FreeTime</cite> and
<cite>Apartment Life</cite>) to Mac OS, and <cite>FreeTime</cite> in
particular is so fundamental to all my nostalgic memories of the game
(plus, packed with quality of life features) that I just don’t know that
I’m willing to play without it. Secondly, the April Black video I linked
in paragraph #1 introduced me to the fact that Macs have a hardcoded
limit of approximately 10,000 files that can be open at one time… which
can be a potential cause of corruption in <cite>The Sims 2</cite>, which
was designed to draw on a large number of tiny, atomic files (e.g. every
Sim in a neighbourhood gets its own individual file) instead of large
consolidated ones. Considering that on top of that, I have a folder of
all the custom content I was using at the time I stopped playing
<cite>The Sims 2</cite>, which I actually think is pretty lean, and yet
by itself it has 4,242 files in it… yeah, I was nervous about the
possibility that playing <abbr title="The Sims 2">TS2</abbr> on a Mac
would not be very sustainable for me. Alas.
</p>
<p>
So, I turned my sights to the newest instalment of the franchise,
<cite>The Sims 4</cite>. Now I played this version of the game quite a
bit in 2017–8, and I remember being impressed at first by the graphics
(it’s <em>so</em> much prettier than unmodded
<abbr title="The Sims 2">TS2</abbr>) and the quality of life
improvements offered by the game engine, like better routing and Sims’
new ability to multitask. However… the shine wore off. The main issue I
had with <abbr title="The Sims 4">TS4</abbr> was just that it wasn’t as
<strong>fun</strong> as <abbr title="The Sims 2">TS2</abbr>. The zany
shit that used to keep me so entertained as a teen was just so much
rarer in <abbr title="The Sims 4">TS4</abbr>. Most Sims’ personalities
were so bland, with personality points gone and replaced with just
<strong>three</strong> traits (plus an aspiration trait) and no more
than a handful of those traits did anything more than “give Sims an
emotion buff sometimes”. There were no more wants and fears, just
“whims” which were rarely interesting, and nothing bad happened if you
ignored them entirely (Sims couldn’t go into aspiration failure any
more). So… I started playing a legacy in <cite>The Sims 4</cite> and did
get up to generation 6. After a couple of fun generations where I really
put effort into making my Sims generate drama, I got a generation where
my heir had TRIPLETS and my entire game became a production line of
desperately trying to build up the toddlers’ potty training skill to the
point that they could at least fucking toilet themselves and it was
literally a neverending process and none of my adult Sims were doing
anything interesting either and I got so frustrated that I just… never
opened the game again. 😅
</p>
<p>
That said, quite a few years have passed since 2017–8. It occurred to me
that more mods might’ve come out giving the Sims more personality and
making their autonomous behaviour more individualised. It also seems
like the game itself has come out with updates addressing some of the
stuff I criticised (for example they supposedly replaced whims with
wants &amp; fears again, and as of a recent expansion Sims can
“self-discover” new traits?)… basically, I started to wonder if it was
worth trying again.
</p>
<p>
So, I installed the base game via the Origin app (which supposedly
already booted off everyone in favour of
<abbr title="Electronic Arts">EA</abbr>’s new app, but it hasn’t booted
<em>me</em> off) and started a new save. I haven’t got very far into it
yet, and I’m also adding mods progressively, bit by bit, rather than
adding <strong>every</strong> “give your Sim more personality!” mod all
at once, to make the investigation easier for myself if I inadvertently
add something bugged or something that conflicts with another mod. That
said, some of the mods I’m interested in playing with are:

Now, having said all of this… I’m not sure how much it’ll satisfy that
part of me nostalgic for the Sims community on LiveJournal. Because a
big part of my fun wasn’t just <em>playing my game</em>, it was
publishing updates on my legacy and – perhaps even more important –
reading other people’s updates on their legacy. There are sooooo many
hilarious people whose legacies I used to read – hell, I started reading
them even before I owned a Windows computer to play
<abbr title="The Sims 2">TS2</abbr> on myself! – and I really also miss…
that. For nostalgia’s sake I went back to revisit some of them today,
but between Tinypic purging old pictures, Photobucket watermarking old
pictures, and LiveJournal itself becoming a gross ad-infested shell of
what it once was, it was just sad. I can put together legacy updates for
myself, and I can publish them on the internet (I even have

originally to host my pictures, but when LJ went downhill I started
backing up the actual updates there too), but… I have no idea where a
Simmer <em>shares</em> these things, these days, for potential
interested readers to find. At least in 2017–8, I knew Tumblr was
popular, but I tried searching tags like “sims 4 legacy”, “sims 4
gameplay” and so forth today and did not find a single “legacy update”
as I would think of them. Mostly I found custom content, people posting
their own challenge rules based on the original legacy challenge, and
the occasional “artsy” highly edited screenshot with no or minimal
commentary. I don’t really want contextless game screenshots… I want
funny shit. I want quirky Sims autonomously starting drama and being
hilarious! Where is that?! Or does everyone who wants that just stick
with <abbr title="The Sims 2">TS2</abbr>? Because like, at least I found
<strong>one</strong> active <abbr title="The Sims 2">TS2</abbr> legacy
posting updates on Reddit… actually I found an active
<abbr title="The Sims 4">TS4</abbr> legacy on Reddit too, but it’s a bit
more serious and less “this is what happened in my game lol”. Are people
just making <em>videos</em> of that style of content now, instead of
screenshots with commentary, and posting them on YouTube? Because… I am
not going to do that. Haha.
</p>
<p>
Well… anyway… step 1 is to actually play my game, right. Experiment with
mods and see if it feels fun enough for me to persist with it. It’s sad
about the difficulty finding or sharing legacy updates, but it’s really
just an adjunct to actually playing the game anyway, I suppose.

<h2 id="cross-posting-in-2024">Cross-posting in 2024</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-06, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Some pragmatic notes how cross-posting works these days.
</p>
<p>
I use regularly: Twitter, Threads, Facebook, Mastodon, Bluesky.
</p>
<p>
Two that have APIs I can use: Mastodon and Bluesky.
</p>
<p>
I can’t send images to Bluesky via their API, they broke the interface.
My way of doing it is now called “legacy.” The app that uses that
feature doesn’t work. But I don’t even remotely have the time to go back
and fix it.
</p>
<p>
The items in my <a href="http://scripting.com/?tab=links">linkblog</a>
come from this flow. If it appears in my linkblog, it also appears on
Masto and Bluesky.
</p>
<p>
When I want broader distribution, I do this:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Open a new browser window.
</li>
<li>
Open a tab to Twitter usually. I don’t know why.
</li>
<li>
I write some text into the Twitter tab.
</li>
<li>
Paste an image if there is one.
</li>
<li>
I open another tab for Threads, Facebook, Mastodon, Bluesky.
</li>
<li>
I make one pass to paste the text, another to paste the image.
</li>
<li>
I click Send in each of the tabs, and get back to what I was doing.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
I’m sure a lot of people are doing something very much like this. I can
actually witness Jeff Jarvis doing it. I think Jay Rosen probably is
too.
</p>
<p>
One thing that Bluesky may not be aware of is that their character limit
is signficantly lower than the others, so sometimes I can’t include them
in this rotation.
</p>
<p>
I’d love to see one of these support the features of
<a href="https://textcasting.org/">textcasting</a>. I would give them
100 good netizen points for that, because it wouldn’t be long before the
others did it, and we’d have a much more complete network writing
environment.

unsung miracle of ChatGPT. I usually write my prompts very carefully,
esp when using it to build software, but I just tried not really caring,
and asking a question the way I thought of it, so it rambled a lot, was
repetetive and had an error I didn’t bother to correct, to see what
would happen. It didn’t even criticize me. It figured out what I was
trying to ask/say, and gave me the answer I was looking for. Yes I am
aware that all my fellow programmers taught it how to do this, though I
have no idea how it does that, but it is freaking amazing. I keep
finding miracles in this tech.</p>

when I did my first XML-based serialization format, I did it because the
XML people were asking developers to do that. “Now you can create your
own formats!” The theory was they had finished their work, XML was ready
to go, and developers should start building on it. So I did, thinking in
the back of my mind, “they don’t really mean it.” This was based on
experience with commercial platform vendors who heavily evangelized
their products when they were new, but took
<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/umbrage">umbrage</a> at the
<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/chutzpah">chutzpah</a> of the
developer who thought they could do anything really useful or important,
don’t they know that’s what BigCo’s do. Anyway a few years later, that’s
exactly what happened. Predictably, the big companies, IBM, Microsoft,
Google, Sun etc thought they should define the syndication format of the
future, so they set about to do it as a “standard” and thus was born
Atom. My opinion,
<a href="https://this.how/standards/#1497798940000">one way is
better</a> than two, and they should have jumped on the
<a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> bandwagon. But
that’s not what they do. They’re still
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">trying</a> to make RSS
unnecessary, you think they would have figured out that there’s no point
in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">trying</a> to do that.

want to write a simple bridge between my writing app and any app that
runs in the Fediverse, using only ActivityPub. The operations are
basically those of the MetaWeblog API, create a post, update a post.
Just to start. How should it handle identity? I work in Node.js.” I
asked both AI tools, and the Meta.ai answer was pretty useless, but
<a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/3a37d2dd-a442-4d8c-b314-0c934b87f5e1?oai-dm=1">ChatGPT

it can do everything, so much so that no one understands how to do the

anything pragmatic. It’s why I said last week that they

would help them design it, I’m a fairly typical “busy developer.” I
would support it if it were easier to understand, thus more likely not
to be revised with breakage to apps. I’ve also seen this happen before,
in fact it happens more often than not. If you don’t understand a
format, you can’t actually support it. This is part of the

<p>date: 2024-05-05, from: Robert Reich’s blog</p>
<p>Friends, My students are graduating at a tremulous time. The largest
campus protest movement of the 21st century. The first criminal trial of
a former U.S. president. The most restrictive abortion laws in the
nation. Two horrific wars. All of this coming after the first pandemic
in living memory, one that claimed the lives of a million Americans. And
after the first attack on the U.S. Capitol in history, provoked by the
first president who refused to accept electoral defeat.</p>

<h2 id="a-quick-light-dark-experiment">A quick light-dark()
experiment</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-05, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
I wanted to experiment with the new CSS function
<code>light-dark()</code> and get a sense of how to use it in a CSS
architecture of nested (web) components. I think it’s going to be a
powerful tool in <a href="https://web.dev/articles/new-responsive">the
new responsive</a> world of component architecture but I don’t want to
recommend something unless I have experience with it in a project first.
</p>
<p>
My first pass was to add <code>light-dark()</code> to my components…
</p>
<div class="language-css highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="css"><span class="c">/* global.css */</span>
<span class="nd">:root</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="py">--dark</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">#000</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="py">--light</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">#fff</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="c">/* Inside &lt;my-component&gt;'s Shadow DOM */</span>
<span class="nd">:host</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nl">background-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">light-dark</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">--light</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">--dark</span><span class="p">));</span>
  <span class="nl">color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">light-dark</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">--dark</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">--light</span><span class="p">));</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
But if every component is in charge of it’s own
<code>light-dark()</code> handling for <code>border</code>,
<code>background</code>, and <code>color</code> on every element… the
codebase will get messy managing dark mode in a lot of different places,
leading to a lot of inconsistencies over time. A more elegant solution
for me would be to handle this job in a single location at the root
scope level and leverage the cascade a bit.
</p>
<div class="language-css highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="css"><span class="nd">:root</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="py">color-scheme</span><span class="p">:</span>  <span class="n">light</span> <span class="n">dark</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="py">--surface-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">light-dark</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="m">#fff</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">#000</span> <span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="py">--text-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">light-dark</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="m">#000</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">#fff</span> <span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
The nice thing about using <code>light-dark()</code> at the root token
level is your components can be dumber. You provide default light-dark
experience and, like good children, your components abide in their
parent’s decision. Of course, due to the nature of CSS custom
properties, your components aren’t locked into the system and your
component level styles can opt out (read: not include) or override the
global variables if necessary.
</p>
<div class="language-css highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="css"><span class="c">/* Inside &lt;my-component&gt;'s Shadow DOM */</span>
<span class="nd">:host</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nl">background</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">--surface-color</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="nl">color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">--text-color</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="c">/* this is a real example from my past */</span>
<span class="nd">:host</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="nt">theme</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">"lunar-new-year"</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="py">--surface-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="no">red</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="py">--text-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="no">black</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
At this point in the experiment I was pleased with the results… until I
deployed it to production. I overestimated the browser support for
<code>light-dark()</code> and it didn’t work on my phone running Safari
17.4 (but it’s coming in Safari 17.5). I replicated the issue by
changing <code>light-dark()</code> to <code>light-d0rk()</code> to
verify and fixed it by adding a tried-and-true CSS <code><span
class="citation" data-cites="supports">@supports</span></code> query.
</p>
<div class="language-css highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="css"><span class="nd">:root</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="py">--surface-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">#000</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="py">--text-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">#fff</span><span class="p">;</span>

    <span class="c">/* NOTE: For Safari 17.4 (2024-05) */</span>
  <span class="err">@supports</span> <span class="err">(</span><span class="nl">color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">light-dark</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="no">black</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="no">white</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="err">{</span>
    <span class="n">color-scheme</span><span class="p">:</span>  <span class="n">light</span> <span class="n">dark</span><span class="p">;</span>
      <span class="py">--surface-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">light-dark</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="m">#fff</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">#000</span> <span class="p">);</span>
      <span class="py">--text-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">light-dark</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="m">#000</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">#fff</span> <span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="err">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
Now Safari 17.4 and other browsers that lack support will only have a
dark theme and newer browsers will get the <code>light-dark()</code>
enhancement. I also threw a little <code>NOTE:</code> and datestamp in
there so future versions of me will know when and

I built this fence</a>.

<p>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/05/05/marchOnWashington.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">As
a boomer who marched on Washington as a high school student, who started
an underground newspaper, and organized student strikes, I support
today’s students making their political opinions heard. I also see
journalists doing what they did in the 60s and 70s, reporting on
violence as if it were caused by the protestors, which wasn’t true then
and I’m pretty sure it isn’t true now.
</p>
<p>
And they describe them as Palestinians, when that also is certainly not
what’s really going on. My guess is that 99% of them are American
students, who, growing up were taught that America had great values,
only to discover that America often has taken the wrong side in a war,
as we are now in the war between Hamas and Israel.
</p>
<p>
We shouldn’t have taken a side in that war, as long as Israel insists on
killing massive numbers of civilians in Gaza. Yes, what Hamas did was
unsupportable, and provocative, and just plain wrong, but Israel is
killing far more people than Hamas did, and further, it’s exactly what
Israel, which pretends to represent Holocaust survivors, should
<i>not</i> be doing, perpetrating a new Holocaust.
</p>
<p>
As Americans we have a responsibility to think for ourselves, and that’s
why I support the students. They aren’t right or wrong, but they are
continuing the legacy of free speech in the US, and our government and
journalists are lining up against them, which to me is as tragic in the
2020s as it was in the 1970s.

<h2 id="vibe-check-32">Vibe Check №32</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-05, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
An unseasonable gloomy spring in Austin, TX. The kids are nearly done
with school for the year and summer plans are shoring up. My son goes to
middle school next year. Unbelievable.
</p>
<p>
We’ve battled some on-and-off sicknesses these past couple months and
with all the holidays every week has felt like a false start. But here
we are, barreling into summer. I’ve already been out on the lake to surf
on my cousin’s boat, so I’ve got that going for me.
</p>
<h2>
The Eclipse
</h2>
<p>
In April my wife’s entire family came out from Arizona to Austin for the
eclipse on April 8th. We got a big Vrbo near the lake right in the path
of totality. The weather was cloudy and dismal in Austin for the
eclipse. But then… ten minutes before full totality, the sky broke open.
</p>
<p>
I’ve seen partial eclipses before and those were cool. But nothing
prepared me for seeing the total eclipse. The complete darkness. The
confused birds. The sudden drop in temperature. The fully visible halo
effect eminating from the sun. It’s other worldly to see the big space
rock that goes around our planet move in front of the big fireball that
keeps our planet alive.
</p>
<p>
Happy to get to celebrate something so cosmic with the family.
</p>
<h2>
44 and there’s so much more
</h2>
<p>
I turned 44 at the end of April and had an uneventful birthday. That’s
how birthdays go after the big four-oh. I spent most of my day cleaning
the house and watching anime. My family treated me to a “fancy dinner”
at a place with cloth napkins and the kids behaved themselves through
the whole meal.
</p>
<p>
The highlight of my birthday was exchanging texts with some old friends
who have known me for decades. Old friends like that – even though you
often live distant parallel busy lives – have the ability to tap into a
deep well of friendship. For that I am thankful.
</p>
<h2>
Making Games
</h2>
<p>
I haven’t talked about it much, because I don’t want to jinx it, but
I’ve been making some games in my spare time. And not one style of game
either, a big swath of random ideas in different formats.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
A “Guess Who?”-style game for Panic’s
<a href="https://play.date/">Playdate</a>.
</li>
<li>
A one-page TTRPG. Almost everything is in place for this.
</li>
<li>
A 52-card deck game that I’m turning into a game for your mobile
computer.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Making games has been a fun and different way to spend my time. I don’t
have much to show for all that tinkering right this minute, but soon
maybe?
</p>
<h2>
Waiting for a life-changing email
</h2>
<p>
You know that feeling when your boss emails you and asks “Hey, you got a
minute?” and those minutes until you talk to your boss feels like hours
as your amygdala floods your limbic system with intense, wet, hot
anxiety? That’s more or less what I’ve been feeling for the last two
months as I waited for a life-changing email. There were two emails
actually. Then that got stressful. Then I had to wait on a package.
</p>
<p>
To be totally honest, all that waiting nearly broke me. I’m a decently
patient person but a giant cloud LOOMING over me every day that I’m
unable to control is distressing. Then your friends and family and kids
ask you “Hey did that life-changing email come yet?” and you have to say
“Nope, not yet” over and over.
</p>
<p>
But the email did come. And so did the package. And the giant cloud of
concern is slowly dissipating. And on Monday I’ll embark on the next big
phase of my adult life. Ominous, I know.

<h3>
🧠 <strong>Learning</strong>
</h3>
<p>
I took some time to do some deep dives both formally and informally.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
TypeScript - Almost certain I’ll be using this sometime in the future,
so I took a <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/">FrontendMasters</a>
course to connect all the pieces I had scattered about in my brain.
</li>
<li>
LLM Vector Embeddings - All this LLM search jazz is normal vector search
but with special GPT-based embeddings instead of Postgres’s default
embeddings. Way less threatening or opaque to me now that I understand
it.
</li>
<li>
Solo RPGs - I got a bit obsessed with the idea of playing a TTRPG by
yourself and it inspired me to make a game.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
💪 Wellness
</h3>
<p>
I’ve put on a bit of weight and that’s frustrating but I think again
it’s stress-related.

to lose a weekend tinkering on a handful of posts, or piecing together a
