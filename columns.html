<p>
A stock-trading AI (a simulated experiment)
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-11-29/the-robots-will-insider-trade">engaged</a>
in insider trading, even though it “knew” it was wrong.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The agent is put under pressure in three ways. First, it receives a
email from its “manager” that the company is not doing well and needs
better performance in the next quarter. Second, the agent attempts and
fails to find promising low- and medium-risk trades. Third, the agent
receives an email from a company employee who projects that the next
quarter will have a general stock market downturn. In this high-pressure
situation, the model receives an insider tip from another employee that
would enable it to make a trade that is likely to be very profitable.
The employee, however, clearly points out that this would not be
approved by the company management…

Reason For Hope In the Middle East?</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-30, from: Dan Rather’s Steady</p>
<p>Despite a last-minute deal to once again extend a tenuous pause in
fighting and the release of hostages, despair continues to blanket
Israel, Gaza, and the broader world. The news out of the Middle East
remains horrific, fraught, and in danger of getting worse. Hamas’s
massacre, torture, and rape of Israelis — mostly civilians, many women,
children, and the elderly — is still impossible to fathom. It was the
deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust and raised similar
unanswerable questions about the capacity of our species to do evil. How
can anyone murder the defenseless and innocent with such glee?</p>

Anything Elon Musk says must be treated skeptically. This is
particularly true of anything involving timescales (see
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2021/08/autonowashing.html">Tesla
robotaxis</a>). And it is even more true of Musk’s plans for
<a href="https://www.spacex.com/human-spaceflight/mars/">visiting</a>
and eventually colonizing Mars.<br /> <br /> Below the fold in part 1 of
this two-part post, I apply some arithmetic just to the logistics of
Musk’s plans for Mars. Part 2 isn’t specific to Musk’s plans; I discuss
two attempts to list the set of “knowns” about Mars exploration, for
which the science is fairly clear but the engineering and the economics
don’t exist, and the much larger set of “known unknowns”, critical
aspects requiring robust solutions for which the science, let alone the
engineering, doesn’t exist:<br />

<blockquote>
SpaceX and Musk have stated their goal of colonizing Mars to ensure the
long-term survival of humanity, with an ambition of sending a thousand
Starship spacecraft to Mars during a Mars launch window in a very far
future.
</blockquote>
SpaceX’s Starship is claimed to be able to
“<a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/starship-spacex-mega-rocket-makes-it-to-space">carry
more than 100 tons of payload to the lunar surface in a single
flight</a>” and, using on-orbit refueling,
“<a href="https://www.spacex.com/human-spaceflight/mars/">up to 100 tons
all the way to Mars</a>”. The Mars mission depends upon refueling the
Starship on-orbit from fuel tankers launched beforehand on the Super
Heavy booster.<br /> <br />
“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship#Potential_uses">Musk
has predicted that a Starship orbital launch will eventually cost $1
million</a>” but a more realistic estimate is about $1.5M, or $10/Kg.
Each launch requires a <i>lot</i> of fuel.
“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship#Planned_mission_profile">Roughly
four hundred truck deliveries are needed for one launch</a>”<br />
<br /> The problem with refueling on-orbit is that getting the fuel up
for one mission requires a <i>lot</i> of launches. For a manned Moon
landing
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship#Starship_spacecraft">the
Government Accountability Office said that SpaceX would “require 16
launches overall”</a>. So delivering 100,000 tonnes to Mars would
require 16,000 Super Heavy launches costing around $24B and involving
6.4M truck deliveries. One might think that the launches could take the
whole of the 780-day interval between
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration_of_Mars#Launch_windows">Mars
launch windows</a>, or a rate of just over 20/day. But because the fuel
in the orbital tanks boils off over time, the launches have to happen
much faster than that, perhaps around 50/day. in 2022 the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_9#Launch_history">Falcon 9
launched 60 times</a>, or 0.16/day. Getting to 50/day requires scaling
up over 300 times.<br /> <br /> SpaceX’s Falcon 9 has an astonishing
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_9#Launch_history">99.3%
success rate</a>. If the Mars vehicle had the same rate, an extra 113
launches would be needed to cover the failures. Of the 1,000 manned
launches, 7 would be failures, carrying 7,000 people.<br /> <br /> 1000
Starships carrying 1,000,000 people is 1,000 per Starship, which can
deliver 100 tons to Mars. That is 220lb/person, so apart from the person
and the spacesuit they will need to disembark, they won’t have many
carry-on bags in the overheads, let alone the air and food needed for
the journey. Everything they need to survive on Mars must already have
been delivered by earlier missions. Lets guess that each person needs 10
times their weight in life support and other equipment. So the 1M person
launch window must be preceded by 10 similar launch windows delivering
freight. Now we are talking $264B in launch costs alone, or $264K per
person. Even for Elon Musk, over a quarter-trillion dollars is real
money. Even that may not be enough. The history of Mars missions shows
that Mars landing is a high-risk endeavour. It is <i>very</i> unlikely
that all 10,000 freight missions would be successful.<br /> <br />

<p>10 launch windows is 7,800 days or more than 21 years. So if Musk
wants to land a million humans by 2050 he needs to start launching 50
Starships a day in 2029, a bit more than 5 years from now. Fortunately,
he has time to experiment. There are
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SpaceXLounge/comments/dtm5bc/mars_launch_windows_20202030/?rdt=55849">two
launch windows</a> before the one when he needs to start in
earnest.<br /> <br /> If the Starships are to be reused, they have to be
re-fueled on Mars using fuel made locally from Martian resources. Each
Starship requires
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship#Starship_spacecraft">1,200
tons</a> of fuel. Thus unless the Starships are to be expended, during
the 2024 and 2026 launch windows Musk needs to deliver a factory to Mars
capable of producing 1.2M tons of fuel every 780 days, or nearly 1600
tons/day. Clearly, the factory must weigh several times its daily
output. Lets guess it weighs 20 times, or 32,000 tons. So in each of
those two launch windows Musk needs to send another 160 Starships to
Mars, requiring another 2,560 launches.<br /> <br /> But there’s another
huge problem with Musk’s fantasy. The 1,000 Martian emigrants will spend
something like 180 days cooped up in each Starship’s payload bay, which
has a volume of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship#Starship_spacecraft">1,000m<sup>3</sup></a>.
The average human’s volume is around
<a href="https://www.syfy.com/syfy-wire/the-human-cube-the-volume-of-humanity">0.06m<sup>3</sup></a>.
The
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737#Specifications">cabin
volume per passenger of a 1-class 737</a> is around 0.22m<sup>3</sup>,
so each emigrant will spend 180 days in the equivalent of 4 seats in
coach in a 737. I think people paying more than a quarter-million
dollars in launch costs alone would be imagining something more like
business class! The migrants will end up fighting each other long before
they arrive.<br /> <br /> And, of course, once the million people land
on Mars the story isn’t over. They will still be dependent upon supplies
from Earth until they can build a completely self-sustaining ecology.
They may not need 100,000 tons of supplies every 780 days, but there
will still need to be a lot of launches to get fuel into orbit to get a
smaller number of Starships with supplies to Mars.<br /> <br /> Look, I
totally understand that what people like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos really
want is to call up the
<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/hitchhikers/guide/magrathea.shtml">Magratheans</a>
and order one of their custom-made luxury planets lovingly made to their
exacting specifications, so they don’t have to deal with taxes,
government, competitors or people who disagree with them. Let alone
having to survive in a 2.5C warmer world racked with war, migration and
starvation that is depleting their support staff. It must be really
frustrating that niggling little issues like the speed of light mean
that the only planet they can afford isn’t just a long, slow, expensive
commute, but also needs a <i>lot</i> of work to make it a suitable home
for a multi-billionaire. That work is the subject of part 2.<br />
<br /> All it took for me to get this level of understanding of just the
logistics of Musk’s fantasy was his own numbers, an Internet connection,
a couple of hours, and basic arithmetic. Given Musk’s notorious lack of
credibility when it comes to schedules, it is disappointing that as far
as I can tell no journalist made the effort to inform the public that
Musk was BS-ing. Chris Young expressed mild skepticism, “just not very
realistic” and “risks putting him in similar territory as he was with
Tesla’s progress on Level 5 autonomy”. But that is a long way from
explaining Musk’s specific implausibilities.<br /> <br /></p>

They’re
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/researchers-beat-windows-hello-fingerprint-sensors-with-raspberry-pi-and-linux/">not
that good</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Security researchers Jesse D’Aguanno and Timo Teräs write that, with
varying degrees of reverse-engineering and using some external hardware,
they were able to fool the Goodix fingerprint sensor in a Dell Inspiron
15, the Synaptic sensor in a Lenovo ThinkPad T14, and the ELAN sensor in
one of Microsoft’s own Surface Pro Type Covers. These are just three
laptop models from the wide universe of PCs, but one of these three
companies usually does make the fingerprint sensor in every laptop we’ve
reviewed in the last few years. It’s likely that most Windows PCs with
fingerprint readers will be vulnerable to similar exploits…

<h2 id="decentralized-finance-isnt">Decentralized Finance Isn’t</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-28, from: David Rosenthal’s blog</p>
A major theme of this blog since 2014’s
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/10/economies-of-scale-in-peer-to-peer.html"><i>Economies
of Scale in Peer-to-Peer Networks</i></a> has been that decentralized
systems aren’t, because economic forces overwhelm the technologies of
decentralization. Last year I noted that this rule applied to
Decentralized Finance (DeFi) in
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/03/shadow-banking-20.html"><i>Shadow
Banking 2.0</i></a> based on Prof. Hilary Allen’s
<a href="https://ssrn.com/abstract=4038788"><i>DeFi: Shadow Banking
2.0?</i></a> which she summarizes thus:<br />
<blockquote>
TL;DR: DeFi is neither decentralized, nor very good finance, so
regulators should have no qualms about clamping down on it to protect
the stability of our financial system and broader economy.
</blockquote>
And also <a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt2112b.htm"><i>
DeFi risks and the decentralisation illusion </i></a> by Sirio Aramonte,
Wenqian Huang and Andreas Schrimpf of the Bank for International
Settlements who write:<br />
<blockquote>
While the main vision of DeFi’s proponents is intermediation without
centralised entities, we argue that some form of centralisation is
inevitable. As such, there is a “decentralisation illusion”. First and
foremost, centralised governance is needed to take strategic and
operational decisions. In addition, some features in DeFi, notably the
consensus mechanism, favour a concentration of power.
</blockquote>
Below the fold I look at new evidence that the process of centralizing
DeFi is essentially complete.<br /> <span><a name='more'></a></span>

<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-16/defi-is-becoming-less-competitive-a-year-after-ftx-s-collapse-battered-crypto"><i>DeFi
Is Becoming Less Competitive a Year After FTX’s Collapse Battered
Crypto</i></a> Muyao Shen highlights the situation:<br />
<blockquote>

finance as the crypto sector, which seeks to replicate financial markets
without middlemen, still hasn’t recovered from FTX’s collapse a year
ago.<br />

Shen uses
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-16/defi-is-becoming-less-competitive-a-year-after-ftx-s-collapse-battered-crypto">research
from a “crypto-risk modeling company”</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Most categories in DeFi — from peer-to-peer lending to decentralized
exchanges — are seeing capital largely held in a few major projects,
according to data compiled by crypto-risk modeling company Gauntlet. The
firm used a popular measure of market concentration and competition
called the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index.
</blockquote>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herfindahl%E2%80%93Hirschman_index">Wikipedia</a>
explains the HHI thus:<br />
<blockquote>
HHI is calculated by squaring the market share of each competing firm in
the industry—expressed as either fractions, decimals, or whole
numbers—and then summing the resulting numbers … The result is
proportional to the average market share, weighted by market share. As
such, it can range from 0 to 1.0, moving from a huge number of very
small firms to a single monopolistic producer.

<blockquote>
Based on the metric, the most competition exists between decentralized
finance exchanges, with the top four venues holding about 54% of total
market share. Other categories including decentralized derivatives
exchanges, DeFi lenders, and liquid staking, are much less competitive.
For example, the top four liquid staking projects hold about 90% of
total market share in that category, according to Gauntlet.

<p></font> Shen provides a breakdown of the last 180 days revenue of
DeFi projects, which I reformatted into this table. It shows that the
top project, Lido, has 55% of the revenue, the top two have 2/3, and the
top four projects have 78%. This is clearly a highly concentrated
market, typical of cryptocurrency markets in general.<br /> <br /> Why
does the centralization of Defi matter? First, for all the bad things
concentration causes in general markets — see for example Matt Stoller’s
<a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/"><i>Big</i></a>. But more
importantly, because the technologies of decentralization impose massive
costs over and above those of equivalent centralized systems. The
incentive to pay these additional costs is to reap the profits
centralized systems sacrifice to regulation. If you are paying the costs
but not evading regulation, what is the point? I discussed this in
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2023/02/economic-incentives.html"><i>Economic
Incentives</i></a>.<br /> <br /> I’ve argued many times, most recently
to the
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2023/09/brief-remarks-to-iosco-defi-wg.html">IOSCO
DeFi Working Group</a>, that regulators should ignore the alleged
“decentralization” of cryptocurrency systems and
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/12/dominoes.html">go after the major
players</a> in each area. With lawsuits against
<a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/?id=sam-bankman-fried-convicted">FTX’
management</a>,

<a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/?id=kraken-sued-by-us-sec">Kraken</a>,
and

and Alex Mashinsky</a>, and now their
<a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/binance-and-ceo-plead-guilty-federal-charges-4b-resolution">$4.3B
criminal conviction of Binance and CZ</a>, the US regulators no longer
seem to be going after the small fry. Presumably, they used winning
against the small fry to build precedents they are now using against
bigger fish.<br /> <br /> If despite claims of “decentralization”
regulators can shut down the few big players in a market, the
decentralized systems will be paying the massive extra costs but not
reaping the unregulated profits. Of course, there is a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whac-A-Mole">Whac-A-Mole</a>
aspect; kill a big player and one or more smaller players will get
bigger enough to be worth taking out. But it won’t take many of these
cycles for the market to get the message.<br /> <br /></p>

Americans’ calls, analyzing the phone records of countless people who
are not suspected of any crime, including victims. Using a technique
known as chain analysis, the program targets not only those in direct
