<p>On Friday, Democracy Forward Foundation sued the Department of
Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to make it
respond to its request for the release of the Epstein files, as well as
all communications the administration has exchanged over the files and
President Donald Trump’s inclusion in them, as required under the
Freedom of Information Act.</p>

<p>date: 2025-08-10, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Theory about why we don’t fight to save the US.
</p>
<p>
Many of us haven’t personally felt much impact.
</p>
<p>
No hyperinflation yet.
</p>
<p>
The police still respond as they always have, wearing badges, faces
uncovered.
</p>
<p>
The shelves are full at the supermarket.
</p>
<p>
The electricity is on, as is the internet. Buses and subways are
running. The airports are open.
</p>
<p>
The Obamas and Clintons are still free, living in the US.
</p>
<p>
We read the news about universities and news orgs giving in. Corruption
at the FBI and in Congress and the Supreme Court.
</p>
<p>
No major hurricanes, earthquakes, fires, tornados so cuts at FEMA not
felt yet.
</p>
<p>
And we’ve been living in a normal way for hundreds of years. We’ve had
no time to get used to the new normal. It doesn’t feel like anything
yet.
</p>
<p>
I fear by the time we feel it it will be far too late, by design.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Lights_(2023_TV_series)">Blue

I watched

Blinders</a> earlier this year and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fall_(TV_series)">The
Fall</a>, another British crime drama, and, amazingly they all take
place in Belfast, believe it or not, and don’t count the number of times
people say “wee” in the darndest places in BBC Belfast crime dramas. Do
Brits really say <i>wee</i> all the time? How did I not see that
coming.</p>

<h2 id="oddμ-hashtags">2025-08-07 Oddμ hashtags</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-10, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2025-08-07-oddμ-hashtags">
2025-08-07 Oddμ hashtags
</h1>
<p>
I was recently looking at my homepage and wondered about all the
hashtags I used and how not all of them had a topic page. The
<a href="Odd%CE%BC">Oddμ</a> page, for example, collects all the
blogposts tagged <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Oddμ">#Oddμ</a>
(including this one). So I looked at the
<a href="oddmu/oddmu-hashtags.1">hashtags</a> command and figured, “this
is going to be easy.” 🤣
</p>
<p>
The first problem is that there are a lot of garbage hashtags. There are
over 1000 hashtags used on this site! The garbage hashtags are the
result of Markdown parsing mistakes that I never fixed. Apparently the
list of hashtags includes the following:
</p>
<pre><code>#1)
#fennel”
#fudge](fudge)_and_the_[pdq](../wiki?action=edit;id=pdq_&quot;click_to_edit_this_page&quot;)_rules_used_in_[zorcererofzo.
ffffff;fill-opacity:1&quot;)
###｣
</code></pre>
<p>
This is not great. 😔
</p>
<p>
I should fix those, and many more. 🤨
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, the hashtags are all downcased. So given a hashtag such as
<code>#advanced_squad_leader</code> the code would have to infer the
page name “Advanced Squad Leader”. But what about the hashtag
<code>#älter werden</code>? If at all, that should link to a page called
“Älter werden”.
</p>
<p>
And so I concluded that this wasn’t easy after all. I saved the changes
I made on a branch, and I don’t think I’ll be merging that into the main
branch.
</p>
<p>
<a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Wikis">#Wikis</a>
</p>
<p>
<strong>2025-08-09</strong>. Well! I think I worked on it and I worked
on it, and then I ran it, and kept on fixing the topic pages it created.
But I think it worked!
</p>
<p>
<strong>2025-08-10</strong>. Yesterday I cleaned up my site (somewhat)
and today I released v1.18 of Oddμ. Yay me!
