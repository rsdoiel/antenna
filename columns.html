was an active software developer when the web came online in the early
90s. I knew what
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=Macintosh">closed
systems</a> were like, and
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=unix">open systems</a>.
The web was open, and a miracle because of its radical simplicity. We
were so lucky. We developed all kind of stuff that was only possible
when there was no platform vendor.
</p>
<p>
But then in the mid 00s things changed, and since then the users have
flocked to
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=twitter">closed</a>
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=facebook">systems</a>.
It would be similarly wonderful if we had an open
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22social%20web%22">social
web</a>, but we don’t. Mastodon is open but it’s not simple like the web
is, and Bluesky is simple, but it is not open. And neither supports the
most basic <a href="https://textcasting.org/">features of the web</a>.
</p>
<p>
Today most active devs weren’t around when the web came along and
knocked down the silos. It is imho possible to have an open social web,
but the people who are trying to make one out of complex and closed
systems will imho never get there.
</p>
<p>
They would be better off to look for different foundations to build on
other than Mastodon and Bluesky. I have
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=wordpress">one</a> in
mind, btw. You will probably be surprised, but then we were all
surprised by the web itself.

<p>date: 2025-06-06, updated: 2025-06-06, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>

On Thursday I testified before the House Committee on Oversight and
Government Reform at a hearing titled
“<a href="https://oversight.house.gov/hearing/the-federal-government-in-the-age-of-artificial-intelligence/">The
Federal Government in the Age of Artificial Intelligence</a>.”
</p>
<p>
The other speakers mostly talked about how cool AI was—and sometimes
about how cool their own company was—but I was asked by the Democrats to
specifically talk about DOGE and the risks of exfiltrating our data from
government agencies and feeding it into AIs.

<p>date: 2025-06-06, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
<i>This was an email I sent to one of the people I’m working with at
Automattic, and realized I was actually writing a blog post. </i>
</p>
<p>
I was watching on the FediForum session yesterday, and heard all this
stuff about Bluesky and Mastodon, but these are products that are poorly
prepared for the “open social web” – and imho they won’t get there. But
WordPress is already there.
</p>
<p>
I think some of the products are good, btw – I hadn’t seen Surf, it’s
basically a feed aggregator that can get input from Bluesky and
Mastodon. I don’t think they’re using their RSS support though. Not
adequate. But WordPress RSS is fine. I made an improvement to the
Scripting News RSS to add an &lt;image&gt; element that works like the
one on a WordPress site. Now my posts can show up in the timeline via
RSS.
</p>
<p>
That’s the key to what we’re doing. Reading and writing, with the UI of
a twitter-like product, all built on RSS, with the content also
appearing on the network WordPress has defined. I see this as huge.
</p>
<p>
Obviously this needs to be a blog post.

with <a href="http://frontier.userland.com">Frontier</a>. Today I might
have one of the largest public codebases written by one human that

<p>
OpenAI just
<a href="https://openai.com/global-affairs/disrupting-malicious-uses-of-ai-june-2025/">published</a>
its annual report on malicious uses of AI.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
By using AI as a force multiplier for our expert investigative teams, in
the three months since our last report we’ve been able to detect,
disrupt and expose abusive activity including social engineering, cyber
espionage, deceptive employment schemes, covert influence operations and
scams.
</p>
<p>
These operations originated in many parts of the world, acted in many
different ways, and focused on many different targets. A significant
number appeared to originate in China: Four of the 10 cases in this
report, spanning social engineering, covert influence operations and
cyber threats, likely had a Chinese origin. But we’ve disrupted abuses
from many other countries too: this report includes case studies of a
likely task scam from Cambodia, comment spamming apparently from the
Philippines, covert influence attempts potentially linked with Russia
and Iran, and deceptive employment schemes…

<p>
Each slot has two inline M.2 (NGFF) slots which accept either a

to peruse the <cite>Shady Characters</cite> Periodic Table of Emoji.

What do I mean by a periodic table of emoji? Well, I answer that
question in some detail
<a href="https://emoji.shadycharacters.co.uk/#what">in the notes under
the table itself</a>, but briefly, I wanted to see if I could use a
table to tell us something about how emoji are perceived. Which emoji
are positive? Which are negative? Which ones convey sentiments that
match their appearances, and which deviate from them?

<h1 id="2025-06-05-oddμ-history">
2025-06-05 Oddμ history
</h1>
<p>
On fedi,
<a class="account" href="https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@reidrac" title="@reidrac@mastodon.gamedev.place"><span
class="citation" data-cites="reidrac">@reidrac</span></a> mentioned that
Oddμ doesn’t keep a page history. The idea is that the wiki is only
accessible to a small circle of trusted people and therefore we don’t
need a history to fight spam and vandalism.
</p>
<p>
Some people like backups so that they can go back in time, however. One
could run a cron job once a day that does a snapshot using
<code>rsync</code>. For my local copy of the wiki I use a Makefile with
a target for that:
</p>
<pre><code>SHELL=/usr/bin/fish

download:
    rsync --archive --exclude '*~' --delete --itemize-changes sibirocobombus:alexschroeder.ch/wiki/ .

diff:
    rsync --dry-run --archive --exclude '*~' --delete --itemize-changes . sibirocobombus:alexschroeder.ch/wiki/

upload:
    rsync --archive --exclude '*~' --delete --itemize-changes . sibirocobombus:alexschroeder.ch/wiki/

snapshot:
    rsync --link-dest ../wiki --archive . ../wiki-(date --iso-8601)/
</code></pre>
<p>
I run <code>make snapshot</code> in a directory called
<code>wiki</code>. The command syncs all the files from the current
directory to a directory containing the current date,
e.g. <code>../wiki-2025-06-05</code> and in order to save space,
unchanged files are simply hard-linked to the file in
<code>../wiki</code>, i.e. the current directory. If I edit files using
an editor, the original is renamed and a new copy is created. Therefore,
the hard-linked snapshots retain their content.
</p>
<p>
One could clean up older snapshots with a cron job and just keep the
last week, for example.
</p>
<p>
If people need access to the old copies, one would do this via the web
server and serve the snapshot directories as static files.
</p>
<p>
If one wanted an even more traditional “no forgiving nor forgetting”
system, there’s always a version control system like <code>git</code>.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/gitwatch/gitwatch?tab=readme-ov-file#gitwatch">gitwatch.sh</a>
is a shell script that can watch a directory using
<code>inotifywait</code>. When it detects changes, it waits for a few
seconds and then adds and commits any changes.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/jw0k/gwatch">gwatch</a> is a program written
in C that does the same thing.
</p>
<p>
Access to the git repository is a different problem, now: One could have
a cron job run <code>git push</code> every now and then and people
access the repository elsewhere. Or one could use something like
<code>cgit</code> to serve a read-only copy of old revisions.

<p>Now a personal comment. What pisses me off most about Bluesky is the
political environment all this is happening in. We <i>need</i> an open
social web. They’ve got a lot of people convinced they are it. They are
not and they know it. And they keep leading people on. They should
either deliver, now, or get out of the way.</p>

readers of my blog know that I’ve been
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=Bluesky">calling out
Bluesky</a> and people associated with it for saying they’re an open
platform, and part of the web, when they are neither. Why don’t people,
esp journalists, call them out on this? We’ve been around this loop over
and over in tech. There’s a virtual conference today, FediForum, that on
their <a href="https://fediforum.org/">home page</a> repeats
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/06/05/promises.png">the
hype</a>. Why do people do this? What’s the point of pouring your time
into technology you hope someday will be open? I bought a ticket to the
conference so if there are any sessions that look like they might be
productive I can participate. I even wrote a
<a href="http://scripting.com/2025/06/04/162206.html">keynote</a>, so
you can see there is a way for this stuff to start working, quickly, if
the vendors you’re looking up to are sincere in their promises. I’ve
posted it on

<h2 id="can-david-frum-hear-me">Can David Frum hear me?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-04, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I’ve been enjoying the new
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/the-david-frum-show/">David
Frum podcast</a>. He’s very good at thinking and does a lot of it, and
expresses himself very well. I read all his columns and have read two of
his books, even though I don’t share much of his pre-Trump politics, I
find it interesting to hear how he parses things. I also subscribe to
The Atlantic. I listen to him. But in this week’s episode it’s clear
that the listening is one-way.
</p>
<p>
In today’s
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/archive/2025/06/david-frum-showwhy-are-the-media-so-afraid-of-trump/683029/">episode</a>
we heard from the elite journalist David Frum, interviewing elite editor
in chief Marty Barrett, formerly of the Washington Post, and they both
make what I believe are wildly inaccurate generalizations about the
quality of the news reporting by professionals and the ugliness and
inadequacy of bloggers and podcasters.
</p>
<p>
The problem is, they don’t read widely enough to know that there are
bloggers and podcasters with good intentions, ethics, deep knowledge and
experience who are also well educated – they don’t know we exist and
therefore can’t hear about the huge mistakes they are making with their
own self-perception of their role that we can see because we are not in
their world. (BTW, I have been in their world, I was a contributing
editor at Wired, a research fellow at Harvard and NYU, each for two
years, and I have collided with Frum-like elites, the usual response is
a hand-wave of dismissal, written off as not worth listening to, I
guess.)
</p>
<p>
Frum, at the end of the episode talks about how the press covered
Biden’s incapacity, that led to the second Trump term. They should have
stopped, once we were all informed of what happened, and let the
<i>electorate</i> decide, it wasn’t up to them, or the celebrities they
gave space to in their op-eds. In the United States, the <i>people</i>
decide. Instead they put up a roadblock and wouldn’t let the issue drop.
We all knew, we were all informed, probably long before we read a single
article about his debate performance. They should have stopped. That was
their malpractice.
</p>
<p>
Their responsibility was to give us the information, and it was also
their responsibility to stop right there. Once informed, they were wrong
in continuing to harp on it.
</p>
<p>
We saw them do it with Governor Cuomo of New York. And Senator Al
Franken. And Donald McNeil at the NY Times. And on and on. There’s so
much reporting that’s lazy and incompetent, but they’ll never report on
that, because of their conflicts. And they never listen to their
critics. And as a result they play a role they are not entitled to play.
</p>
<p>
They need to wake up to the idea that while reporting from their bubble
is still important and is heard, they misuse it regularly, and we are
fed up with it. If they want to control the government, do the right
thing, and run for office. Don’t do it from your byline in the
Washington Post or NY Times.

<h2 id="my-keynote-for-fediforum">My keynote for FediForum</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-04, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
<a href="https://fediforum.org/">FediForum</a> is a virtual conference
that starts on June 5. If they had asked me to keynote, this is roughly
what I would say.
</p>
<p>
Imho this stuff is pretty freaking simple, esp since there are well over
20 years of prior art to use, and not that many ways to do what we’re
trying to do. I’m impatient, so here’s a quick set of observations with
my opinion, take it for what it’s worth, ymmv, etc.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
You shouldn’t be reinventing so much. Always look around for
<a href="http://essaysfromexodus.scripting.com/priorArtDesignMethod">prior
art</a>. That will make it possible for you to interop more quickly at
both a software level and at a human level.
</li>
<li>
Don’t invent stuff you think you may need later. Save that for later.
You have no intuition for what’s needed and more important nothing to
test against. You will get it wrong 100 percent of the time.
</li>
<li>
Don’t invent stuff you think you may need later that makes what you’re
doing now more complicated. I see a lot of that in ActivityPub.
</li>
<li>
The only reason you’re doing all this work is for interop. If you’ve
been doing it for years and you don’t have much meaningful interop
you’re doing it wrong.
</li>
<li>
Write the software first. Use formats that exist, or if you must invent
new stuff, make sure it’s simple. Work on its simplicity as you would
any other feature. Factor! If there are going to be 100 interoperable
products and you make it a little more difficult to implement, that work
will be multiplied 100 times. And it be a barrier to entry, so you may
not get the most powerful interop possible with the most interesting
products.
</li>
<li>
Read and follow the <a href="https://this.how/standards/">Rules for
Standards-makers</a>. There aren’t that many. But if you’re breaking
them, you’re not going to end up with a standard. If your goal is to
appear to be making standards, you should also read RFSM, and don’t do
anything in it. I’ve seen people do that btw.
</li>
<li>
Have you looked at the world outside the tech stuff to see how important
this all has become? All the time we’re wasting is very costly in
everything that depends on the social web actually existing as opposed
to just being talked about.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Now, what would I request if I could influence you??
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Mastodon and Bluesky should support inbound and outbound RSS, and do it
really well. Right now they do outbound only, and the implementations
are incomplete at covering the functionality they have now, and there
needs to be more (see the next item).
</li>
<li>
They’d support the basic features of the
<a href="https://textcasting.org/">textcasting</a> spec, including
Markdown because it’s a great standard, very much of the same school as
RSS. If it had existed when we did RSS 2.0 it would have been part of
it.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
That’s it. Really not much work.
</p>
<p>
From there we’d have 25 years of interop to explore.
</p>
<p>
And we could really call this the open social web.
</p>
<p>
I’m ready to do it any time you all are.
</p>
<p>
Yours in not wasting time.
</p>
<p>
Dave

because it’s part of a network that requires an avatar-like image. This
required me to go through some very old code that my system still
depends on. It’s remarkable how much time this seemingly small feature
took to implement. One of these days I have to move this code to one of
my more modern servers. One reason it took so long is that a random
package that does something that never changes, had a breaking change in
it. The breakage culture of the Node.js world is just plain fucked up,
no other word for it.</p>

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
If the Ukrainians could sneak drones so close to major air bases in a
police state such as Russia, what is to prevent the Chinese from doing
the same with U.S. air bases? Or the Pakistanis with Indian air bases?
Or the North Koreans with South Korean air bases? Militaries that
thought they had secured their air bases with electrified fences and
guard posts will now have to reckon with the threat from the skies posed
by cheap, ubiquitous drones that can be easily modified for military
use. This will necessitate a massive investment in counter-drone
systems. Money spent on conventional manned weapons systems increasingly
looks to be as wasted as spending on the cavalry in the 1930s…

<p>If you followed the Knicks through the playoffs as I did, I recommend
the latest
<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/indianas-incredible-finals-run-a-knicks-summer/id1043699613?i=1000710778336">episode</a>
of the Bill Simmons podcast. It began with talk about the fan base and
that got me thinking. We don’t know what would happen if the Knicks were
in the Finals. Honestly. It could be the antidote to the crazyness.
Maybe the reason things are so fucked up is that it’s been 52 freaking
years since the Knicks won the title. Something happens every so often,
the energy field around the Knicks shifts – Patrick Ewing, Melo,
Linsanity and now Brunson. It’d be interesting to map that out against
events in the world at the corresponding times. We won’t find out this
year. In the same way I sensed that New Orleans was doomed when I went
to school there, I have a strong feeling connecting the Knicks to
something not sure what, but it feels big.</p>

<a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/05/29/3">CVE-2025-5054
and CVE-2025-4598</a>, both vulnerabilities are race condition bugs that

handle crash reporting and core dumps in Linux systems.

“This means that if a local attacker manages to induce a crash in a
privileged process and quickly replaces it with another one with the
same process ID that resides inside a mount and pid namespace, apport
will attempt to forward the core dump (which might contain sensitive
information belonging to the original, privileged process) into the
namespace.”…

Rosen gave a
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jayrosen.bsky.social/post/3lqmvt22be22u">brilliant
short talk</a> in 2008 about the role of links in the web, and how
journalism would have a hard time translating their self-contained
worlds with the idea of the web, which is there is no container other
than the whole world. Lots of important ideas in Jay’s talk. For
example, the idea of developing something from one direction or the
other. The problem with Bluesky and Mastodon is that they’re coming from
Twitter, and think they’re aiming toward the web, apparently – but they
must not understand the web, because they’re going to have to break with
Twitter’s model in <a href="https://textcasting.org/">so many ways</a>
to reach the web, they’ll never get there if they go slowly. If you
tried to develop the social web by starting with the web, you arrive at
a different place, w/o all the problems of twitter-like systems.
Different problems, but not the ones the twitter model has. How do I
know? Because I know. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span></p>

Doc’s post as viewed in Bluesky. His picture dominates. Imho it
shouldn’t.
</div>
</p>
<p>
I realize no one designed this, but it also is reality, it’s how a lot
of people see Doc’s writing.

<p>
Here’s my suggestion. When the user specifies a
<a href="https://wordpress.com/support/featured-images/">featured
image</a> for a post, set the og:image element in the head section of
the page. When they don’t specify such an image, omit that element.

<p><a href="https://paulkrugman.substack.com/p/hating-new-york">Krugman
is right</a>, living in NYC is amazing. When I lived in Manhattan betw
2010 and 2019, I had it great but toward the end I yearned to live in
the mountains, the year before Covid hit (that was a bad time to be in
Manhattan, btw). Now I yearn to again live in the city. Funny how that
works. Even in the 70s I felt safe in NYC, and I commuted to school from
Queens to the Bronx. It was safe enough to let a 14 year old kid ride
the subway into Manhattan and up to the Bronx and back, every freaking
day. I never got mugged. And I did all kinds of dangerous stuff that
independent-minded teen agers do. If you can afford it, I recommend you
spend some time in NYC before you believe the bullshit the Repubs say
about it. They have reasons not to like the cities that have nothing to
do with how nice it is. In NYC we don’t trust our politicians to tell
the truth. You shouldn’t trust yours so much either, dear Republicans.

<h2 id="your-butt-still-stinks">Your butt still stinks</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-02, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Human beings spend far to much effort feeling better than some people or
feeling inferior to others.
</p>
<p>
This is understandable, I guess, as far as evolution is concerned, up to
a point, but I think we’ve been past that point for a long time now.
Now, evolution brought us to a point where in order to survive as a
species we have to get over this need to rank people and work together.
</p>
<p>
So if you feel other people are better than you, get over it. Same thing
if you feel better than others. You aren’t and they aren’t.
</p>
<p>
Your shit still stinks and as the great Republican philosopher Joni
Ernst so eloquently put it, she’s going to be dead pretty darned soon
and so will you.
</p>
<p>
I have to remind myself of this when I see a picture of someone who is
really ugly but acts like they’re not. And when I say ugly, I mean ugly
inside. I say to myself “Davey, they are reflecting off something inside
yourself that you don’t like. On a different day they might seem very
beautiful to you!” So I can relax and stop worrying so much about what I
think about them in the moment. It matters not one bit.

Made backups of three laptops and the external disk where we keep our
media to one of our set of external backup disks, and took those to the
office about 2 km away from where we live, exchanging them for the other
set of external backup disks which we had there. One set is always
outside of the house. Not sure whether that would help in an urban
disaster like an earthquake or a flood, but it would at least help
against a fire or a burglary.

morning and welcome to June. Another
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/opml/2025/05.opml">month
gone</a>, and coincidentally the end of the NBA season. I woke up this
morning with the worst hangover ever, and I haven’t had a drink in
months (never was my vice, I have others). The Knicks lost fair and
square to the Indianas last night. My first message came from NakedJen
who isn’t as far as I know a Mets fan, saying simply “Let’s go Mets!” I
like that, though it will of course take me some time to get
re-adjusted. I think the Knicks were jinxed because Brunson said in

Yankees. What! No. I think we may have to consider trading him to a team
without
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=philosophy">philosophy</a>.
I’m not sure anyone will have him though, considering this possibly
fatal flaw, philosophy-wise. And no doubt the Knicks are going to change
some things over the summer, and I’ve heard that they might try to get

unless they try to become a contender without kicking the Knicks in the

<h2 id="alt-text-on-this-blog">2025-05-27 Alt text on this blog</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-01, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2025-05-27-alt-text-on-this-blog">
2025-05-27 Alt text on this blog
</h1>
<p>
On the web, the alt text is a description of an image to be shown by
browsers when the image cannot be shown – like text browsers or screen
readers. So what about alt text on this blog? What about blog posts full
of photos, specifically? Like the <a href="Croatia">Croatia</a> posts.
</p>
<p>
I think that alt text should be unnecessary on my blog because the text
should carry the entire message. “Welcome to my
<a href="Wall_of_Text">Wall of Text</a>!” 😄
</p>
<p>
On fedi, I like alt text and I both read and write it. I hate clients
that don’t display it. I want to always read it. Therefore, on my blog,
the equivalent of alt text should always be readable. But real alt text
isn’t shown to me – the browser is showing me the pictures, instead. It
makes sense. And on fedi it only works because the applications and
front-ends don’t just use the alt text attribute for images in HTML –
they have an extra user-interface to allow me to read it. Buttons,
mouse-over, long-press, whatever it takes.
</p>
<p>
There are options for this blog, of course. Except I don’t like these
options.
</p>
<p>
I could reuse the alt text as the image title attribute which is shown
on mouse-over by default. I don’t like being forced to use mouse and I
don’t like duplicating the description.
</p>
<p>
In Markdown:
</p>
<pre><code>![alt text](url &quot;title&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>
I could automatically use the alt text as the title attribute but I
still don’t like to use the mouse to read the title attribute and I
wouldn’t be able to switch Markdown rendering engines as easily if I
hack it. Writing some Javascript to produce extra pop-ups or some other
user-interface element would be even worse, and it would need extra
clicking or keyboard navigation as a reader. No way.
</p>
<p>
The last option is the best. Just write the description above the image:
</p>
<pre><code>Description

![](url)
</code></pre>
<p>
I’ve tried using the title attribute for some of my recent picture-heavy
blog posts about Croatia and I’ve been checking the result using Gemini
and Gopher, and I’m not happy.
</p>
<p>
Compare the following two with the
<a href="https://alexschroeder.ch/view/2025-05-17-%C5%A1ibenik">web</a>
version where I can’t read the alt text. (Screenshots from
<a href="https://gmi.skyjake.fi/lagrange/">Lagrange</a> on my phone.)
</p>
<p>
The <a href="gemini://alexschroeder.ch/2025-05-17-šibenik">Gemini</a>
version looks OK with some text paragraphs being links to the images.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-27-alt-text-1.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
The <a href="gopher://alexschroeder.ch/02025-05-17-šibenik">Gopher</a>
version shows the alt texts as weird disjointed text paragraphs that
sometimes repeat the preceding paragraph and sometimes don’t.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-27-alt-text-2.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
I guess I could write longer alt texts until the Gopher version looks
good but then the Gemini version looks weird and the web version
continues to not show it.
</p>
<p>
Now check the Gemini and Gopher output for the page you’re reading right
now!
</p>
<p>
The <a href="gopher://alexschroeder.ch/02025-05-27-alt-text">Gopher</a>
version is OK. The line-breaks don’t look nice on the phone at the
default resolution so ignore that weird line-break. What we can see is
that the empty alt text generated an empty paragraph. Something I should
fix. 😅 But in general, it looks OK and reads well.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-27-alt-text-3.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
The <a href="gemini://alexschroeder.ch/2025-05-27-alt-text">Gemini</a>
version still looks OK. It also links to the Gopher and Gemini versions,
so ignore those extra links. 😅 The browser substitutes the filenames
for the missing alt text. That works for me. I’m not sure what a screen
reader would do. Probably say: “Image. 2025-05-27-alt-text-3.jpg”? And
I’m not sure what a person with bad sight would prefer. At this point
I’d know that I can skip the image since I have already read the
description above.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-27-alt-text-4.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
And here’s the same passage a day later, using the text browser
<code>lynx</code>. The inline links look good, and there’s no trace of
the screenshots. This is great! It’s as readable as the Gopher version
with no extra line-breaks, and the inline links are inline (unlike in
the Gemini version).
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-27-alt-text-5.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Checking with <code>edbrowse</code>. The inline links are wrapped in
bracers, which looks good, and the images with no alt text are shown as
empty square brackets (<code>[]</code>) which works for me. Ideally, I
guess, they’d just disappear.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-27-alt-text-6.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
All in all, I think this solution is better: Instead of alt text, just
write more text above each image.
</p>
<p>
What I’m less sure about is whether this automatically implies that all
images are “decorative” and therefore should have an empty alt text
(instead of no alt text). It seems to me that the filename being shown
is a lot of visual clutter, but that only seems to affect Gemini, not
the text browser.
</p>
<p>
What do you think?

<strong>2025-05-29</strong>. I fixed that minor issue in
<a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/markdown-gopher.git/">markdown-gopher</a>
so that it skips paragraphs containing just images with no alt text. 😄
</p>
<p>
<strong>2025-05-31</strong>. I added a piece of Javascript to copy the
alt text to the title attribute if the alt text is set and the title is
not. Perhaps that’ll motivate me to add more alt text.
</p>
<p>
This is what I added to my <code>view.html</code> template for
<a href="Odd%CE%BC">Oddμ</a>:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
function addTitle() {
  const images = document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;img&quot;);
  for (let img of images) {
    const alt = img.getAttribute(&quot;alt&quot;);
    const title = img.getAttribute(&quot;title&quot;);
    if (alt != null &amp;&amp; title == null) {
      img.setAttribute(&quot;title&quot;, alt);
    }
  }
}
window.addEventListener('load', addTitle);
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>RSS never had a big corporation acting as a benefactor. Is that why
imho RSS hasn’t been considered as the backbone of the social web?
Probably more likely it’s the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fog_of_war">Fog Of War</a> nature
of tech development. We have so many forks of so many things we don’t
know what anyone else is doing. It’s easier to invent your own than
figure out what the other thing did. Perhaps ChatGPT et al will change
that. Yesterday I used it to get an understanding of how the
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/320">content:encoded
element</a> came to exist and evolved, and you’d think I of all people
would know, but I didn’t. ChatGPT
<a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/6839d31f-9910-8012-b324-a0bb3c052f4f">did</a>.</p>

does Apple invent their own proprietary plugs when everyone else does
USB? Even if you don’t like to speak ill of Apple, you <i>know</i> why
they do it. They want to control who can make add-ons to their products
in hardware, just as they do in software. I still buy their products,
but I also buy products that use standards, so I can use them on lots of
devices. Now, the same thing happens in software from other people and
companies. They can choose to use what already exists, or invent their
own. Example, I chose MP3 for podcasting, did not invent a new format.
If I were to do a social web network, I would use RSS, I wouldn’t invent
a new format. I want interop. I want to create an open platform, I don’t
mind making money, but that’s not why I do it.</p>

2025-05-30 Roses along the way
</h1>
<p>
I went <a href="2025-05-30-limmat">for a walk</a> and found a lot of
rose-like flowers (and others). I want to illustrate the struggle with
the Flora Incognita app because you can’t just take its output and
“believe”. But in order to question the details one has to know them –
and I usually do not, when it comes to flowers. So I’m left wondering.
</p>
<p>
Rotblättrige Rose<br> Rosa glauca
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-30-roses-1.jpg" alt="a flower with five pink petals and leaves that have a reddish shine" />
</p>
<p>
Büschel-Rose<br> Rosa multiflora
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-30-roses-2.jpg" alt="a white flower with five petals and yellow stamen" />
</p>
<p>
Wein-Rose (Artengruppe)<br> Rosa rubiginosa agg.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-30-roses-3.jpg" alt="a flower with five petals that are white at the center and pink further out, with yellow stamen" />
</p>
<p>
Strangely, this one is supposed to be <em>Rosa glauca</em> again even
though the colour is more light purple, there are more petals, the
anther is darker and the leaves are greener. So confusing. 🫤
</p>
<p>
Rotblättrige Rose<br> Rosa glauca
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-30-roses-4.jpg" alt="a light purple rose" />
</p>
<p>
And this is another repeat. OK, why not. They look similar enough.
</p>
<p>
Büschel-Rose<br> Rosa multiflora

<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-30-roses-5.jpg" alt="another white flower with five petals" />

<p>
Hunds-Rose<br> Rosa canina
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-30-roses-6.jpg" alt="a pale pink flower with yellow stamen" />

Again!

<p>I’ve thought about joining in with the indieweb carnival a few times,
but procrastinated. This months struck me, May 2025 IndieWeb Carnival:
Small Web Communities – uncountable thoughts. I’d love to hear your
experiences of them, why and how you participate and what you think are
the key ingredients for a successful small web community. […]</p>

<p>In July 2024, according to an article published today by Kirsten
Grind and Megan Twohey in the New York Times, billionaire Elon Musk
texted privately about his concerns that government investigations into
his businesses would “take me down.” “I can’t be president,” he wrote,
“but I can help Trump defeat Biden and I will.”</p>
