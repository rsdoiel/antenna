makes me want to hire someone less than them showing an open to work
badge</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-20, from: Chris Heilmann’s blog</p>
<p>I just came across a post on X that stated “nothing makes me want to
hire someone less than this”, with a picture of the “open to work” badge
LinkedIn offers job seekers. This being X, I thought I answer using
appropriate voice: This, albeit succinct, is not very enlightening, so
let me elaborate… Like […]</p>

been looking up all kinds of things now that my new Daytona search
engine has access to my blogging going back to 1994. I just did a
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=mullenweg">search for
Mullenweg</a>, and came up with this
<a href="https://ma.tt/2006/04/feed-validator/">blog post</a> by Matt in
2006 about the Feed Validator. The clarity is remarkable, and he’s of
course right. The people running the validator were actually promoting
Atom over RSS, and were trying to tilt the table towards Atom. The goal
was
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=interop">interop</a>,
not to give Google or IBM control of the syndication format of the open
web. When you keep changing your mind about what to flag and what to
pass you end up with a standard that’s as murky as the tariff policy of
the US in 2025. I think you have to assume that was the goal. They
didn’t like that RSS didn’t fall apart when Atom came out. If there’s no
benefit in changing, people don’t.</p>

<h2 id="doordash-hack">DoorDash Hack</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-20, updated: 2025-05-20, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
A DoorDash driver
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/669140/doordash-driver-convicted-delivery-scam">stole</a>
over $2.5 million over several months:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The driver, Sayee Chaitainya Reddy Devagiri, placed expensive orders
from a fraudulent customer account in the DoorDash app. Then, using
DoorDash employee credentials, he manually assigned the orders to driver
accounts he and the others involved had created. Devagiri would then
mark the undelivered orders as complete and prompt DoorDash’s system to
pay the driver accounts. Then he’d switch those same orders back to “in
process” and do it all over again. Doing this “took less than five
minutes, and was repeated hundreds of times for many of the orders,”
writes the US Attorney’s Office…

<h2 id="andrew-hickey">Andrew Hickey</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-19, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:2tjsq6a4vn6pww2iva5qj23v">Andrew
Hickey</a> whose <a href="https://500songs.com/podcast/">podcast</a> I
support, also appears to be strongly against people using ChatGPT.
</p>
<p>
I am a programmer, so you might think I’d see it the same way because
what I do is similar to what musicians and prose writers do in that I
create “intellectual property” which can be easily copied.
</p>
<p>
But we have a different culture in software, we tend to by default share
what we do and let other people use it. They’re supposed to credit us,
but people are selfish and greedy and they will tend to take whatever
isn’t bolted down, and it sucks, but you accept it.
</p>
<p>
What’s funny is Hickey appears to have no clue how much he’s benefited
from this ethos. His success probably would not have been possible
without some people thinking it’s more important to create the medium he
could use any way he saw fit, than to own one that would probably have
kept him out.
</p>
<p>
Creating is not as linear as he appears to think, which so ironic
because that’s basically what his freaking podcast is about. He loves to
say “no one did anything first” (paraphrasing) and that’s basically the
<a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2011/09/09/onlyStealFromTheBest.html">same
idea</a>.
</p>
<p>
And I don’t doubt that the next big media invention, the next
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=podcasting">podcasting</a>
perhaps, will benefit enormously from having ChatGPT available for the
people developing it.
</p>
<p>
PS: This appeared earlier as a
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lpjn22v22s2k">post</a>
on Bluesky. And I wrote every freaking word, as I always do unless
disclaimed.

<p>Don’t believe the Chinese AI open-source hype, warns good friend,
Pete Warden. Their large language models come at a price — the models
are programmed to deliberately obscure historical truths, he writes on
his blog. He points out that this isn’t just censorship; it’s engineered
misinformation at scale, baked into the foundation of future
AI. Warden compares answers to the same query using different models to

people to write menus of scripts in Frontier that appear inside other

It was kind of magical, esp when the apps themselves were scriptable
(many of them were in the 90s). Next up, I’m going to import the home

asshole, and I hope you all know that. Just watched the OKC win over
Denver. All around an incredible group in the final four, very diverse
and inclusive. And btw now that I think of it, Jaylen Brown was

Knicks players by the balls. I hope you all come to terms with that. We
