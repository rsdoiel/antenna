      <h1>Trying to Make Sense of Casing Conventions on the Web</h1>

(date: 2025-09-04, from: <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2025/casing-on-the-web/">Jim Nielsen blog</a>)
      <p>
      <p>(I present to you my stream of consciousness on the topic of casing as it applies to the web platform.)</p>
<p>I’m reading about <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/command-and-commandfor" >the new <code>command</code> and <code>commandfor</code> attributes</a> — which I’m super excited about, declarative behavior invocation in HTML? YES PLEASE!! — and one thing that strikes me is the casing in these APIs.</p>
<p>For example, the <code>command</code> attribute has a variety of values in HTML which correspond to APIs in JavaScript. The <code>show-popover</code> attribute value maps to <code>.showPopover()</code> in JavaScript. <code>hide-popover</code> maps to <code>.hidePopover()</code>, etc.</p>
<p>So what we have is:</p>
<ul>
<li>lowercase in attribute names<ul>
<li>e.g. <code>commandfor=&quot;...&quot;</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>kebab-case in attribute values<ul>
<li>e.g. <code>show-popover</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>camelCase for JS counterparts<ul>
<li>e.g. <code>showPopover()</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After thinking about this a little more, I remember that <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2010/WD-html-markup-20101019/documents.html#case-insensitivity" >HTML attributes names are case insensitive</a>, so the browser will normalize them to lowercase during parsing. Given that, I suppose you could write <code>commandFor=&quot;...&quot;</code> but it’s effectively the same.</p>
<p>Ok, lowercase attribute names in HTML makes sense. The related popover attributes follow the same convention:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>popovertarget</code></li>
<li><code>popovertargetaction</code></li>
</ul>
<p>And there are many other <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes" >attribute names in HTML</a> that are lowercase, e.g.:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>maxlength</code></li>
<li><code>novalidate</code></li>
<li><code>contenteditable</code></li>
<li><code>autocomplete</code></li>
<li><code>formenctype</code></li>
</ul>
<p>So that all makes sense.</p>
<p>But wait, there are <em>some</em> attribute names with hyphens in them, like <code>aria-label=&quot;...&quot;</code> and <code>data-value=&quot;...&quot;</code>.</p>
<p>So why isn’t it <code>command-for=&quot;...&quot;</code>?</p>
<p>Well, upon further reflection, I suppose those attributes were named that way for extensibility’s sake: they are essentially wildcard attributes that represent a family of attributes that are all under the same namespace: <code>aria-*</code> and <code>data-*</code>.</p>
<p>But wait, isn’t that an argument for doing <code>popover-target</code> and <code>popover-target-action</code>? Or <code>command</code> and <code>command-for</code>?</p>
<p>But wait (I keep saying that) there are kebab-case attribute names in HTML — like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/meta/http-equiv" >http-equiv</a> on the <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tag, or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/form#accept-charset" ><code>accept-charset</code></a> on the form tag — but those seem more like legacy exceptions.</p>
<p>It seems like the only answer here is: there is no rule. Naming is driven by convention and decisions are made on a case-by-case basis. But if I had to summarize, it would probably be that the default casing for new APIs tends to follow the rules I outlined at the start (and what’s reflected in the new <code>command</code> APIs):</p>
<ul>
<li>lowercase for HTML attributes names</li>
<li>kebab-case for HTML attribute values</li>
<li>camelCase for JS counterparts</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s not even get into <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Attribute" >SVG attribute names</a></p>

      AI is as good at writing software as it is in creating competent visual art. It's only amazing in terms of how much more a novice can do. It doesn't mean what they create is interesting in more than a gee-wiz way, and the novelty fades pretty quickly I've found.

      ChatGPT might not give you the best answer. Yesterday I hit a problem with the MySQL hosting service, and as we worked it out, ChatGPT and me, I ended up contacting the ISP's support asking them to restart the server, something I cannot do through the control panel. They don't do that, and made a couple of suggestions which didn't seem to make sense based on what ChatGPT had told me. So I tried what they suggested and it worked, and went back to ChatGPT and asked what it thought, and it said yes of course that worked, and would you like me to show you how to do it even better. I guess it takes a path and never goes back to see if there isn't a better one. We've been through this before. Anyway, always be circumspect about it's advice, it's not just hallucinations you need to watch for. That said, with help from both ChatGPT and Digital Ocean, I now have a better setup, and it should run without the problem we hit yesterday.

      Another thing I should have mentioned, about the title of the <a href="https://shownotes.scripting.com/scripting/2025/09/03/lastChanceForTheOpenWeb.html">podcast</a>, I think this <i>is</i> the last chance for the open web. It may already be too late. Look at what's happening politically in the US now and ask how tolerant the government is going to be of an open web. We always had to deal with the possibility that they would shut down free speech here. It has been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_Decency_Act">tried</a>, didn't work in the 90s. But the guardrails that existed then possibly don't exist now. The same things that are forcing CBS for example to become a controlled press, may affect the web too, but you won't read about it in the NYT or hear about it on Maddow because they have low regard for non-professional people writing on the web.

      <p>I'm from this area in Queens, Flushing, Whitestone, Bayside. They were sleepy little places then but now have become interesting. Trump says NYC is a mess, but it's not. Trump is from the Archie Bunker generation. Very dated from a Queens perspective.</p>

<p>I bought a used 2023 Nissan Leaf in 2025, my first 'new' car in 15 years. The above photo was taken by the dealership; apparently their social media team likes to post photos of all purchasers.</p>

<p>I test drove a Tesla in 2012, and quickly realized my mistake. No gasoline-powered car (outside of supercars, maybe? Never drove one of those) could match the feel of pressing the throttle on an electric.</p>

<p>I started out with a used minivan, which I drove into the ground. Then I bought a used Olds that I drove into the ground. Then I bought a used Camry that I bought before we had kids, when I had a 16 mile commute.</p></div>

      <h1>Speaking at Web Day Out</h1>

(date: 2025-09-04, from: <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/22113">Jeremy Keith Blog</a>)
      <p>
      
<p>Half of the line-up of speakers for <a href="https://webdayout.com/">Web Day Out</a> is already on the site. One more is already confirmed.</p>

<p>I’m ridiculously excited about the way the line-up is taking shape, and judging by the zippiness of ticket sales, so are lots of my peers. Seriously, <a href="https://ti.to/clearleft/web-day-out">don’t wait to get your ticket</a> or you might end up missing out completely.</p>

<p>I’ve already got a shortlist of other people I could imagine on the line-up, but I’m open to more suggestions. If you’d like to speak at <a href="https://webdayout.com/">Web Day Out</a>—or you know someone you think would be great—<a href="mailto:jeremy@clearleft.com">send an email</a> to jeremy@clearleft.com</p>

<p>I won’t be checking my work email while I’m away on holiday next week but it would be lovely to come back to an inbox of exciting suggestions.</p>

<p>A couple of pointers…</p>

<p>I’d rather not have too many people like me on the line-up. White dudes are already over-represented in this industry, especially at conferences.</p>

<p>If you’ve never given a talk before, don’t worry. I’d love to help you put your talk together and coach you in presenting it. <a href="https://adactio.com/about/speaking/">I have some experience in this area</a>.</p>

<p>No product pitches. That includes JavaScript frameworks and CSS libraries.</p>

<p>If I get even a whiff of “AI”, your proposal doesn’t stand a chance. There are many, many, <em>many</em> other events that are only too happy to have wall-to-wall talks about …that sort of thing.</p>

<p>If you end up speaking at <a href="https://webdayout.com/">Web Day Out</a> you will, of course, be paid. We will, of course, cover travel and accommodation too. We can’t afford the travel costs of bringing anyone in from outside Europe though (and we’d like to keep the carbon footprint of the event as small as possible).</p>

<p>Web Day Out has <a href="https://webdayout.com/agenda/">an opinionated agenda</a> all about showing what’s possible in web browsers today. Some potential topics include:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_view_transitions">view transitions</a>,</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Invoker_Commands_API">invoker commands</a>,</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_anchor_positioning">anchor positioning</a>,</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_scroll-driven_animations">scroll-driven animations</a>,</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps">progressive web apps</a>,</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components">web components</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The emphasis should be on using stuff in production rather than theoretical demos.</p>

<p>If you’ve got a case study about using the web platform—perhaps migrating away from a framework-driven approach—that would fit the bill perfectly.</p>

<p>How’s all that sounding? Know someone who could deliver the goods? <a href="mailto:jeremy@clearleft.com">Let me know</a>!</p>

      <p>Anthropic <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/detecting-countering-misuse-aug-2025">reports</a> on a Claude user:</p>
<blockquote><p>We recently disrupted a sophisticated cybercriminal that used Claude Code to commit large-scale theft and extortion of personal data. The actor targeted at least 17 distinct organizations, including in healthcare, the emergency services, and government and religious institutions. Rather than encrypt the stolen information with traditional ransomware, the actor threatened to expose the data publicly in order to attempt to extort victims into paying ransoms that sometimes exceeded $500,000.</p>
<p>The actor used AI to what we believe is an unprecedented degree. Claude Code was used to automate reconnaissance, harvesting victims&#8217; credentials, and penetrating networks. Claude was allowed to make both tactical and strategic decisions, such as deciding which data to exfiltrate, and how to craft psychologically targeted extortion demands. Claude analyzed the exfiltrated financial data to determine appropriate ransom amounts, and generated visually alarming ransom notes that were displayed on victim machines...</p></blockquote>

      I really dislike how the Lynx WWW browser looks on some modern systems. On my  SGI it  was OK -  it simply respected  IRIS terminal  colors. On modern systems in seems to be full of colors with gray background. Text colors are quite  nice but I have disliked the  gray background. I have wished to have or black one  or transparent one (it a terminal emulator supports transparency).

      Today  my  wife  requested  new  keyboard. I  thought  that  the  Apple white-transparent keyboard is too inferior  to her IBM laptop keyboard. Well, it is. So I have replaced it by spare HP one. A HP keyboard which was a part of the PA-RISC Visualize workstation (the workstation itself does not work, unfortunately). And she is happy with it.

      <h1>2025-09-02 Feeds</h1>

(date: 2025-09-03, from: <a href="https://alexschroeder.ch/view/2025-09-02-feed">Alex Schroeder's Blog</a>)
      <p>
      <h1 id="2025-09-02-feeds">2025-09-02 Feeds</h1>

<p>I am once again thinking of the feed as a generic single-file export format (RSS or Atom, it doesn&rsquo;t matter to me). Does that make sense? Or would it make more sense to just zip HTML and images? The only benefit of using a feed is that the format is standardised, I guess.</p>

<p>Feeds as an export format only if the feed items contain images as attachments or as data URIs 😨 I guess? I mean, feeds are good enough to feed the text of pages into a search engine like <a href="Xobaque">Xobaque</a>, but if the feed is supposed to act as real export format, the other assets are also important.</p>

<p>And what happens if an image is used by two pages? The feed format would mean that both pages need to declare it as an attachment, no? So I&rsquo;m guessing, the feed as a universal import and export mechanism is just not good enough.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Oddμ has two feed exports on the command-line:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="oddmu/oddmu-export.1">oddmu-export(1)</a>, to export all the pages in a single feed file. Use this for the initial load of a site into Xobaque.</li>
<li><a href="oddmu/oddmu-feed.1">oddmu-feed(1)</a>, to render a feed for a single page. Use this for the initial load of a particular hashtag into Xobaque. Take <a href="Emacs">Emacs</a>, for example. If you just look at the <a href="Emacs.rss">online feed</a>, it contains the last ten items. The <code>feed</code> subcommand, on the other hand, generates a feed containing <em>all</em> the items.</li>
</ul>

<p>And yet, I think the <em>archive</em> action (not enabled on this site) is the more useful one, in general. Except the archive contains the Markdown files, not the HTML files. So you still need to run <a href="oddmu/oddmu-static.1">oddmu-static(1)</a> to generate the static site.</p>

<p>Lately, I&rsquo;ve been writing a shell script to take an HTML export from <a href="Oddmuse">Oddmuse</a> sites and convert them to <a href="Odd%CE%BC">Oddμ</a> sites. This requires a conversion from HTML to Markdown (getting rid of the quirky wiki markup). I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://github.com/JohannesKaufmann/html-to-markdown">html2markdown</a> even though it&rsquo;s &ldquo;sponsored by 🔥 Firecrawl, where you can scrape any website and turn it into AI friendly markdown with one API call.&rdquo; 🤮 There are two alternatives written in Python: <a href="https://github.com/Alir3z4/html2text">html2text</a> translates HTML to text that happens to be Markdown; <a href="https://github.com/dlon/html2markdown">html2markdown</a> does that and preserves untranslated HTML. Something to keep in mind!</p>

      <h1>2025-08-15 An opt-in search engine: Xobaque</h1>

(date: 2025-09-03, from: <a href="https://alexschroeder.ch/view/2025-08-15-xobaque">Alex Schroeder's Blog</a>)
      <p>
      <h1 id="2025-08-15-an-opt-in-search-engine-xobaque">2025-08-15 An opt-in search engine: Xobaque</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been writing a search engine that doesn&rsquo;t crawl the web.
I called it <a href="Xobaque">Xobaque</a>.</p>

<p>On <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/2025-08-22">2025-08-22</a> I set it up to <a href="https://search.emacslife.com/">search Planet Emacslife</a>.</p>

<p>Xobaque is entirely opt-in and push based: web admins have total control over what they want to have indexed. The drawback is that web admins have to upload their pages!</p>

<p>I foresee this to be a solution for sites that don&rsquo;t have good local search, like <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/">Emacs Wiki</a>, or communities, like all the blogs on <a href="https://planet.emacslife.com/">Planet Emacslife</a>. If we want to rely less on big search engines, we have to provide our own.</p>

<p>Technically, Xobaque is writen on top of the <a href="https://sqlite.org/fts5.html#sorting_by_auxiliary_function_results">SQLite FTS5 Extension</a>. This extension does all the heavy lifting: indexing, searching, ranking, highlighting, snippets, boolean operators. Boolean operators! Do you remember those? Good times. The extension is quite amazing, really.</p>

<p>What Xobaque provides is the command-line interface and the web interface. Right now, the command-line interface has a command to initialize an empty database and a command to upload a single page.</p>

<p>Here are some examples of how to use this in a script.</p>

<p>My homepage:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/fish
cd /home/alex/alexschroeder.ch/wiki

<p>The alternative to uploading via the command-line, I think, will be feed ingestion. Web site owners can send their feeds to Xobaque and it will index the entries in the feed. If the entries have the full text, that&rsquo;s great. If they have an excerpt, that works, too. You opt-in with whatever you provide.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m assuming that this will be a system for friends only, so the upload will be protected by a login. Otherwise, people will be able to upload other people&rsquo;s sites and that violates the opt-in idea.</p>

<p><strong>2025-08-15</strong>. I have that vague idea that it would process OPML files like the <a href="https://planet.emacslife.com/opml.xml">Planet Emacslife OPML</a> or the three RPG Planet OPML files, <a href="https://campaignwiki.org/rpg/indie.opml">Indie</a>, <a href="https://campaignwiki.org/rpg/osr.opml">OSR</a> and <a href="https://campaignwiki.org/rpg/other.opml">Other</a>. From the OPML files Xobaque would know a bunch of feeds which it could then use for updates. I have written <a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/planet-jupiter.git/">Planet Jupiter</a>, so I know that from 80% to 90% is handling blogs that are down and from 90% to 100% it&rsquo;s all about fiddling with the markup… There&rsquo;s also the question of consent. So perhaps one would have to start a new list of feeds for those people who explicitly consent. And if by chance that covers all the feeds on Planet Emacslife or RPG Planet that&rsquo;d be a reason to laugh and party! 🎉</p>

<p><strong>2025-08-17</strong>. Adding feeds and collections of feeds (via OPML files) works, now. 🎉</p>

<p>The feed import from the net should use ETags and If-Modified-Since headers if possible, but the convenience functions of bot the feed and the OPML library don’t provide this, so I’ll have to roll my own. And then think of parallelising the requests. Go channels ahoy! 😬</p>

<p>And then a web UI for uploads and accounts? 🥺</p>

<p><strong>2025-08-19</strong>. Xobaque now knows how to skip feeds that haven’t updated using <code>If-Modified-Since</code> and <code>If-None-Match</code> headers.</p>

<p><strong>2025-08-19</strong>. The errors I&rsquo;m finding in the feeds of Planet Emacslife OPML:</p>

<pre><code>Error importing feed https://lifeofpenguin.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss: XML syntax error on line 1: illegal character code U+FFFF

</code></pre>

<p>But I guess I have 248/253 feeds imported.</p>

<p>Other issues I have noticed: Endless repeats of news items that overwrite each other, only differing in title and description, and no GUID set:</p>

<pre><code> Update http://tromey.com/elpa/news.html
</code></pre>

<p>Then again, the items all have dates set from 2007 to 2010, so perhaps that&rsquo;s OK.</p>

<p>And now I find:</p>

<pre><code># ./xobaque search alex schroeder

.&lt;/p&gt;

      <h1 id="2025-08-28-online-safety-maybe">2025-08-28 Online safety, maybe</h1>

<p>The longer I provide web services to strangers, the more I feel that data is toxic. I used to think I only had to worry about spam and vandalism, but with every regulator thinking that far more terrible material is just waiting to show up, and that they need to go after the recipients instead of the perpetrators, I&rsquo;m really starting to feel it.</p>

<p>DMCA and its descendants all over the world were pretty bad when it came to the anti-circumvention clauses but pretty OK when it came to a lack of moderation. And I know, moderation is good. But I also like the fact that I can host a lot of wikis without having to moderate. Luckily, it wasn&rsquo;t necessary in the last 20 years (other than spam and vandalism). It&rsquo;s getting somewhat harder to be excited by it all, though.</p>

<p>For example, the Online Safety Act in the UK basically requires moderation before publication (or geo-blocking the UK).</p>

<p>Another example is my <a href="Xobaque">Xobaque</a> &ldquo;search engine with no crawler&rdquo; that relies on feeds to provide the pages to index. The feeds are untrusted data provided by strangers on the Internet. Should Xobaque check that the pages actually exist? Should I check that they are on-topic and don&rsquo;t violate the law? (In what jurisdictions?) Should I verify the identities of the people that upload the feeds? The people writing the feeds?</p>

<p>Or should I just stand on the balcony and water the plants, listening to the drone of planes above and constant rumbling of cars in the distance, tending my garden, as it were.</p>

<p>I suspect this is the beginning of chilling effects. For a short while, tinkering at home felt the same, whether it was a little something for the household or for &ldquo;the Internet&rdquo;. As it becomes clear that private and public spheres are in fact different, something must change. The first time I realised this was during the Napster days of copyright and music. The more this happens, the more I feel that online activity basically requires a lawyer, a company (the sacrificial lamb should you stumble somewhere on the way), and all the other contraptions of corporate life. Blech!</p>

      <h1>Indirect Prompt Injection Attacks Against LLM Assistants</h1>

      <p>Really good <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/invitation-is-all-you-need/home">research</a> on practical attacks against LLM agents.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12175">Invitation Is All You Need! Promptware Attacks Against LLM-Powered Assistants in Production Are Practical and Dangerous</a>&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Abstract:</b> The growing integration of LLMs into applications has introduced new security risks, notably known as Promptware­&#8212;maliciously engineered prompts designed to manipulate LLMs to compromise the CIA triad of these applications. While prior research warned about a potential shift in the threat landscape for LLM-powered applications, the risk posed by Promptware is frequently perceived as low. In this paper, we investigate the risk Promptware poses to users of Gemini-powered assistants (web application, mobile application, and Google Assistant). We propose a novel Threat Analysis and Risk Assessment (TARA) framework to assess Promptware risks for end users. Our analysis focuses on a new variant of Promptware called Targeted Promptware Attacks, which leverage indirect prompt injection via common user interactions such as emails, calendar invitations, and shared documents. We demonstrate 14 attack scenarios applied against Gemini-powered assistants across five identified threat classes: Short-term Context Poisoning, Permanent Memory Poisoning, Tool Misuse, Automatic Agent Invocation, and Automatic App Invocation. These attacks highlight both digital and physical consequences, including spamming, phishing, disinformation campaigns, data exfiltration, unapproved user video streaming, and control of home automation devices. We reveal Promptware’s potential for on-device lateral movement, escaping the boundaries of the LLM-powered application, to trigger malicious actions using a device’s applications. Our TARA reveals that 73% of the analyzed threats pose High-Critical risk to end users. We discuss mitigations and reassess the risk (in response to deployed mitigations) and show that the risk could be reduced significantly to Very Low-Medium. We disclosed our findings to Google, which deployed dedicated mitigations...</p></blockquote>

      General note: When I say RSS, I recognize that there are other feed formats, but I don't want to confuse things. The software makes all that transparent, so let's make it transparent for the users too, ok?

      <p>
      <p>If all the people who love RSS and make software for it, feed readers, editors, blogging software, put our heads together, we could make a great network for people to write on, that would be so exciting, it would pull a lot of interest from the silos. If momentum builds, they will eventually add RSS as an inbound and outbound format because they will want to be on this network. </p>
<p>We, as writers, shouldn't have to live with the compromises that come from having to make 5 versions of everything, and still you don't have a way to share a lot of the interesting stuff people write.</p>
<p>If we choose to work together, even just a few of us, we could make big change.</p>

      <p>How you know you’re <i>reallllly</i> old. You tell Alexa to play songs by Elton John and you find yourself singing along with <a href="https://youtu.be/75r0nQu-hMs?si=eB17vFtdknnE8lbJ">Crocodile Rock</a> with tears streaming down your face. Then they play <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM4Xm2MGLNQ">Philadelphia Freedom</a>. Mama mia.</p>

He's singing about a generation-older than mine. Yet it planted in my memory connected to a period in my own life. I was a freshman at Lehman College in the Bronx, recovering from a raucous high school experience where I dropped out and moved into an apartment in the Bronx at 16 and came pretty close to losing my middle-class education-valuing upbringing. At Lehman, I was investing in myself and found out I was good at the things I thought I was no good at because the teachers were so awful. I got a good math teacher, Dr Isaacs, who treated me special because I had a good mind for math, it turns out. And thus I became a programmer when I thought I would likely go into politics before that. I still had the taste for politics, and as it turns out, writing, so I combined all of them into one, and out comes blogging and podcasting, and complicated algorithms that do simple easy to understand things. </p>

      From Ingrid Fetell Lee&#8217;s latest Joyletter, #92 The Facts of Life: It took me a long time to understand that it&#8217;s so hard to buffer ourselves against criticism because letting go of the idea that criticism is true also means letting go of praise as well.

      <h1>Luke 15:7</h1>

(date: 2025-09-02, from: <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2025/09/luke-157.html">David Rosenthal's blog</a>)
      <p>
      <table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/KJV-King-James-Version-Bible-first-edition-title-page-1611.jpg" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="2048" data-original-width="1310" height="200" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/KJV-King-James-Version-Bible-first-edition-title-page-1611.jpg" width="128" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_James_Version">Source</a></td></tr></tbody></table>
The title of the post refers to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_James_Version"><i>King James Version</i></a> of the Bible:
<blockquote>
I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance.<br />
<blockquote>
<i>Luke 15:7</i>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
In the throes of 2008's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_financial_crisis">Global Financial Crisis</a> Satoshi Nakamoto published <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf"><i>Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System</i></a>. It inspired a large group of enthusiastic advocates who asserted that Bitcoin would possess the following attributes:<br />
<ul>
<li>It would be <i>decentralized</i>.</li>
<li>It would be <i>trustless</i>.</li>
<li>It would be <i>censorship resistant</i>.</li>
<li>It would be securely <i>encrypted</i>.</li>
<li>Users would be <i>anonymous</i>.</li>
<li>Users could transact <i>without intermediaries</i>.</li>
<li>Users could transact <i>cheaply</i>.</li>
</ul>
In short, it would enable users to escape the clutches of the TradFi (traditional finance) system that had so obviously failed. It has been obvious for many years that it doesn't, and in July there appeared a truly excellent <i>mea culpa</i> from a former advocate, Peter Ryan's <a href="https://www.compactmag.com/article/money-by-vile-means/"><i>Money by Vile Means</i></a>. Below the fold I comment on it, and a couple of other posts describing how TradFi has obliterated Nakamoto's vision.<br />
<span><a name='more'></a></span>
<br />
Ryan explains his <a href="https://www.compactmag.com/article/money-by-vile-means/">involvement with the Bitcoin cult</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
I was once a Bitcoin true believer. Back in 2013, I sat in a New York University classroom when an eccentric libertarian took to the podium to evangelize the new currency. Drawn to the message, I soon interned at the Bitcoin Center on Wall Street, where I participated in the nascent community. I later hosted events promoting the merits of cryptocurrencies. In 2018, I joined the crypto-focused news site CoinDesk, where I reported on the industry. I also produced a <a href="https://www.primevideo.com/detail/0R9WC9KG9Y24OL780OG9C8SXGA/ref=atv_dp_share_cu_r">documentary series</a> on cryptocurrencies.<br />
<br />
I was never a major player in the ecosystem, but as I met various influential figures and learned more about how crypto really worked, I began to realize that behind the rhetoric of freedom, decentralization, and empowerment was a reality in which a few elites were accumulating immense wealth under false pretenses. As the cryptocurrency economy expanded and evolved over the course of the 2010s, it became hard to ignore how radically the facts diverged from the vision I had been sold. So in 2019, I <a href="https://medium.com/@_peterryan/leaving-crypto-166c6ccfda0b">wrote</a> a Medium post called “Leaving Crypto,” terminated all my crypto-related contracts and collaborations, and sold all my crypto assets.
</blockquote>
His current take on the cult <a href="https://www.compactmag.com/article/money-by-vile-means/">is</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Bitcoin’s founding goal of fighting unconstrained government spending has been inverted, as crypto is increasingly serving as a means of enabling more deficit spending, an agenda the Trump administration has all but explicitly embraced. Today, crypto is merely the latest ruse to persuade the public to surrender democratic freedom and financial sovereignty to oligarchs.
</blockquote>
One interesting part is his history of the <a href="https://www.compactmag.com/article/money-by-vile-means/">internal politics of the cult</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The Bitcoin Foundation was created in 2012, with Ver, among others, on the leadership team. Its mission <a href="https://blog.bitmex.com/the-bitcoin-foundation/">stated</a> that it would be “funding the Bitcoin infrastructure, including a core development team.” Funding came from Bitcoin insiders, whether large investors like Ver or companies like Bitcoinstore, Mt. Gox, Bitinstant, Coinbase, and CoinDesk. It is estimated that the foundation had a few million (in dollar terms) under its control to finance developers and other activities. But amid allegations of mismanagement and ties to individuals accused of corruption, criminality, and incompetence, the Bitcoin Foundation became defunct in 2015.<br />
<br />
A new centralized authority arose in the same year when the entrepreneur and former MIT Media Lab director Joi Ito <a href="https://joi.ito.com/weblog/2015/04/15/announcing-mit-dci.html">announced</a> the launch of the Digital Currency Initiative under his department within MIT. As its website states, “DCI was formed… in order to provide a stable and sustainable funding for long-term Bitcoin Core developers.” Parallel organizations emerged as well. For-profit entities like Blockstream, Block (formerly Square), Xapo, and BitMEX, as well as non-profit organizations like Chaincode Labs and Brink, also helped fund developers.<br />
</blockquote>
Ryan's point is that the software that defines and implements Bitcoin is controlled by a small group of people who are lavishly funded by institutions that profit from their efforts.<br />
<br />
He doesn't mention the other central locus of control over Bitcoin, <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2025/05/who-is-mining-bitcoin.html">Bitmain</a>, the dominant supplier of mining ASICs and power behind 7 of the top 8 mining pools.
The large mining pools <a href="https://www.compactmag.com/article/money-by-vile-means/">dominate Bitcoin</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
By one estimate from Hashrate Index, Foundry USA and Singapore-based AntPool control more than 50 percent of computing power, and the top ten mining pools control over 90 percent. Bitcoin blogger 0xB10C, who analyzed mining data as of April 15, 2025, found that centralization has gone even further than this, “with only six pools mining more than 95 percent of the blocks.”
</blockquote>
But by far the most interesting part is Ryan's history of the <a href="https://www.compactmag.com/article/money-by-vile-means/">block size war</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
This conflict was over whether to increase transaction capacity in each block by increasing the block size limit from 1 MB to 2 MB. The impetus for the proposed increase came from miners; in opposition was the “small block” faction, led by Bitcoin software developers.
</blockquote>
The <a href="https://www.compactmag.com/article/money-by-vile-means/">software developers</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
argued that Bitcoin was best scaled by way of non-Bitcoin based “layer 2s,” which interfaced with Bitcoin but were not bound by its structure and incentives. Increased Bitcoin transaction capacity would increase the aggregate variable fees miners could receive, whereas frozen Bitcoin transaction capacity meant that providers of layer 2s could divert those fees to themselves. For example, Blockstream—one of the major Bitcoin companies—offered a layer 2 product called the Liquid Network, which promised to accommodate increased demand for transactions. Blockstream employed high-profile Bitcoin Core developers. Digital Garage, co-founded by MIT’s Joi Ito, invested in Blockstream. This put lead maintainer van der Laan, whose role was funded by Ito’s DCI, in the nexus of Blockstream as well.
</blockquote>
In other words, the institutions backing the small group in charge of the software stood to benefit from abandoning the idea that Bitcoin was a medium of exchange that individuals could use for anything but speculation. Nakamoto never saw the block size limit as fundamental, so this was clearly heretical.<br />
<br />
Ryan's account is long and detailed, including the <a href="https://www.compactmag.com/article/money-by-vile-means/">victory of Bitfinex and Tether</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
No cryptocurrency exchange was bigger than Bitfinex. Bitfinex was an <a href="https://x.com/adam3us/status/1416178398708310017">early investor</a> in small blocker-led Blockstream. Bitfinex’s executives also managed Tether, the company that pioneered stablecoins: cryptocurrency tokens backed 1-to-1 with the equivalent dollar reserves.<br />
...<br />
On Jan. 1, 2017, the tether supply was about $10 million. By Aug. 1, it grew 32 times to a total of $319 million. By Jan. 28, 2018, it was $2.3 billion. In just about one year, the Tether company’s supply of tether tokens and its alleged 1-to-1 reserves grew 230 times.
</blockquote>
Ryan quotes <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.12903">Griffin and Shams</a> and <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2021/attorney-general-james-ends-virtual-currency-trading-platform-bitfinexs-illegal">NY AG Letitia James</a> and <a href="https://www.compactmag.com/article/money-by-vile-means/">concludes</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
When all these sources are digested together, the logical conclusion is that unbacked dollar-like tokens were printed to tilt prices on an exchange bottleneck. Bitfinex, an exchange with a clear small block conflict of interest, was in total control of what Griffin and Shams described as a pseudo-central bank.
</blockquote>
He sums up the <a href="https://www.compactmag.com/article/money-by-vile-means/">result of the war</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
With the victory of the small blockers, Nakamoto’s theory that miners controlled Bitcoin crashed on the shores of reality. Miners were subordinate actors. They were scared of backing the losing side in the Scaling War and having their holdings go to zero. They also had to deal with short-term operating expenses of running server farms, which meant they needed to convert Bitcoin holdings to fiat currencies to pay their bills. The miners couldn’t afford to fight a war of attrition. A decentralized market didn’t decide the outcome of the Scaling War—a small group with conflicts of interest and a de facto money printer did.
</blockquote>
There is far more good stuff in Ryan's account than just the snippets I quoted above. You should go read the whole thing.<br />
<br />
You should also read Michael Kendall's <a href="https://manonthemargin.com/bitcoin-the-new-tradfi/"><i>Bitcoin: The New Tradfi</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Adam Back was an OG anarchist cypherpunk.  Bitcoin arose out of the cypherpunk movement connected to online messaging during the infancy of the internet. Back shared correspondence with Satoshi and has been involved with Bitcoin since its inception. He’s the inventor of Hashcash whose cryptography became foundational to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work consensus, the founder of Blockstream, and a main contributor to Bitcoin Core. To say that Back has been a proponent of the original promise of Bitcoin would be a gross understatement.  Back has been one of the strongest champions of every initial promise of Bitcoin’s decentralized financial system.  That is until he sold out to Tradfi and essentially pulled the plug on everything he and his long promotion of Bitcoin stood for.
</blockquote>
Because Bitcoin is useless for anything except speculation, most of the time the demand for transactions is low, meaning transaction fees are low and miners' income depends upon the block reward. The characteristic of speculators is herd behavior, so occasionally they all want to transact at the same time and fees <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2025/03/bitcoins-fee-spikes.html">spike enormously</a> for a brief interval. A payment system in which not merely is the value of the coin volatile but so is the cost of transacting is not useful.<br />
<br />
In an article entitled <a href="https://coingeek.com/curtain-falls-on-btc-decentralization-theater-mining-crumbles/"><i>Curtain falls on BTC’s decentralization theater; mining crumbles</i></a>, Steve Stradbrooke explains what Back did:<br />
<blockquote>
Bitcoin Core/Blockstream developers were largely responsible for ensuring <a href="https://coingeek.com/btc-sandcastles-and-the-next-civil-war/">the network <i>didn’t</i> proceed down the path</a> that would have allowed individual network blocks to carry a sufficient number of transactions to make mining profitable as block rewards shrink.<br />
<br />
The <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a4a362a6-cc8b-4188-8658-75183a3d6f5f">Financial Times</a> reported this week that Blockstream’s founder/CEO, Adam Back, is in “late-stage talks” to contribute up to 30,000 BTC tokens worth ~$3 billion to a new ‘treasury’ firm being cooked up by Cantor Fitzgerald ...<br />
<br />
Back once <a href="https://x.com/adam3us/status/1182811867011604480">declared</a> that “individuals using a peer to peer ecash, are the very reason for existence of Bitcoin.” Back now believes that the one true path is handing BTC to Wall Street investment bankers to launch a company that does nothing but warehouse tokens while selling shares in that company (at a premium to the value of its BTC) to ‘individuals’ who don’t know better.
</blockquote>
Kendall <a href="https://manonthemargin.com/bitcoin-the-new-tradfi/">concludes</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
From the foundational backing by the unaudited Tether Ponzi that manipulates bitcoin’s price, to the shift from Defi to Tradfi as the only means to keep the system propped up (defeating Bitcoin’s reason for existence), and to vocal charlatans like Michael Saylor who are now the face of Bitcoin, Bitcoin belies Satoshi’s decentralized digital promise.  Everything Satoshi’s White Paper envisioned for Bitcoin no longer exists.  All that remains is a non-sustainable, manipulated asset where speculative frenzy defines its valuation.
</blockquote>
Also worth reading is Ann Pettifor's <a href="https://annpettifor.substack.com/p/capitalism-devours-crypto"><i>Capitalism Devours Crypto</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Crypto - the criminal currency promoted by libertarians of a pioneering, frontier spirit - is being looted by the age-old criminality of capitalism - even while its global valuation rockets to $4 trillion; and even as it is clothed in the respectability of US Congressional and Presidential approval, with cover promised by US regulatory institutions.
</blockquote>
Pettifor focuses first on <a href="https://annpettifor.substack.com/p/capitalism-devours-crypto">(meta)stablecoins</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Crypto interests wanted to integrate Stablecoins into the regulated US financial system so that crypto assets and bank accounts could in future be protected by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, just as ordinary bank deposits are. In other words, the crypto sector wanted to be protected from losses or failure (insolvency) by the US rules-based system sponsored by the American taxpayer.<br />
<br />
With the passing of the GENIUS Act, Stablecoin interests achieved their goal.
</blockquote>
But she points to a <a href="https://annpettifor.substack.com/p/capitalism-devours-crypto">different motive</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
But Financialised Capitalism - i.e. Wall Street - had a very different, and a far more devious motive for integrating digital Crypto ’narrow banks’ within the financial system.<br />
<br />
That motive: nothing less than the subordination of DeFi to the financial interests of TradFI.<br />
<br />
This is where ‘crypto treasury companies’ come into the picture. By first luring the global crypto community of fiery libertarians into the rules-based system governed by the GENIUS ACT, THE US Federal Reserve and US institutions, Wall Street helped to inflate the price of crypto currencies. . As a consequence, sky-rocketing crypto valuations have risen to what many consider are unsustainable levels.
</blockquote>
And there is one <a href="https://annpettifor.substack.com/p/capitalism-devours-crypto">crypto treasury company in particular</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Crypto treasury companies are already well established and one is way ahead in the race to inflate the biggest bubble in Wall Street’s history.<br />
<br />
That company is Strategy, previously MicroStrategy, and is led by one Michael Saylor.<br />
<br />
Strategy bears an uncanny resemblance to a company at the heart of one of the biggest Ponzi schemes in history - the South Sea Company
</blockquote>
Wkikpedia summarizes the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Sea_Company">South Sea Company</a> thus:<br />
<blockquote>
In Great Britain, many investors were ruined by the share-price collapse, and as a result, the national economy diminished substantially. The founders of the scheme engaged in insider trading, by using their advance knowledge of the timings of national debt consolidations to make large profits from purchasing debt in advance. Huge bribes were given to politicians to support the acts of Parliament necessary for the scheme. Company money was used to deal in its own shares, and selected individuals purchasing shares were given cash loans backed by those same shares to spend on purchasing more shares. The expectation of profits from trade with South America was talked up to encourage the public to purchase shares, but the bubble prices reached far beyond what the actual profits of the business (namely the slave trade) could justify.

<blockquote>
Sky-high share prices are attracting a constant flow of new investors all keen to make quick capital gains from this giant and expanding Ponzi scheme. In a process not unlike the financial wheel of fortune depicted in Hogarth’s merry-go-round of 1721 (see below), the purchase of Strategy shares speeds up the speculative frenzy and in a positive feedback loop, further inflates the market capitalisation of the company.

      <h1>Announcing Web Day Out</h1>

(date: 2025-09-02, from: <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/22106">Jeremy Keith Blog</a>)
      <p>
      
<p>I’m going to cut right to the chase: <a href="https://clearleft.com/">Clearleft</a> is putting on a brand new conference in 2026. It’s called <a href="https://webdayout.com/">Web Day Out</a>. It’ll be on Thursday, March 12th right here in Brighton. <a href="https://ti.to/clearleft/web-day-out">Tickets are just £225+VAT</a>. You should be there!</p>

<p>If you’ve ever been to <a href="https://responsivedayout.com/">Responsive Day Out</a> or <a href="https://patternsday.com/">Patterns Day</a>, the format will be familiar to you. There’s going to be eight 30 minute talks. Bam! Bam! Bam!</p>

<p>Like those other one-day conferences, this one has a laser-sharp focus.</p>

<p><a href="https://webdayout.com/">Web Day Out</a> is all about what you can do in web browsers today. You can expect talks that showcase hands-on practical uses for the latest advances in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript APIs. There will be no talks about libraries, frameworks or build tools, and I can guarantee there will be absolutely no so-called “AI”.</p>

<p>As you might have gathered, <a href="https://webdayout.com/agenda/">this is an opinionated conference</a>.</p>

<p>If you care about performance, accessibility, and progressive enhancement, <a href="https://webdayout.com">Web Day Out</a> is the event for you.</p>

<p>Or if you’ve been living in React-land but starting to feel that maybe you’re missing out on what’s been shipping in web browsers, <a href="https://webdayout.com">Web Day Out</a> is the event for you too. And I’m not talking about cute demos here. This is very much about shipping to production.</p>

<p>I’ve got half of the line-up assembled already:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.jemimaabu.com/">Jemima Abu</a>,</li>
<li><a href="https://rachelandrew.co.uk/">Rachel Andrew</a>,</li>
<li><a href="https://lolaslab.co/">Lola Odelola</a>, and</li>
<li><a href="https://clagnut.com/">Richard Rutter</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://webdayout.com/jemima-abu/#talk">Jemima’s talk</a> gives you a flavour of what to expect at Web Day Out:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In this talk, we’ll take a look at how to use HTML and CSS to build simpler alternatives to popular JavaScript components such as accordions, modals, scroll transitions, carousels etc We’ll also take a look at the performance and accessibility benefits and real-life applications and use-cases of these components.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Web Day Out will be in <a href="https://webdayout.com/venue/">The Studio Theatre</a> of the Brighton Dome, which is a fantastic intimate venue. That means that places are limited, so <a href="https://ti.to/clearleft/web-day-out">get your ticket now</a>!</p>

      <p>
      <p>In the early 1960s, National Security Agency cryptanalyst and cryptanalysis instructor Lambros D. Callimahos coined the term &#8220;Stethoscope&#8221; to describe a diagnostic computer program used to unravel the internal structure of pre-computer ciphertexts. The term appears in the newly declassified September 1965 document <i><a href="https://www.governmentattic.org/59docs/NSAlDCCDAC1965.pdf">Cryptanalytic Diagnosis with the Aid of a Computer</a></i>, which compiled 147 listings from this tool for Callimahos&#8217;s <a href="https://ia601207.us.archive.org/22/items/Legacy_Callimahos-nsa/Legacy_Callimahos.pdf">course</a>, <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/portals/75/documents/news-features/declassified-documents/cryptologic-spectrum/Callimahos_Course.pdf">CA-400: NSA Intensive Study Program in General Cryptanalysis</a>.</p>
<p>The listings in the report are printouts from the Stethoscope program, run on the NSA&#8217;s Bogart computer, showing statistical and structural data extracted from encrypted messages, but the encrypted messages themselves are not included. They were used in NSA training programs to teach analysts how to interpret ciphertext behavior without seeing the original message...</p>

      In honor of American Labor Day ✊ I worked in local government for eight years, which was sometimes empowering and sometimes demoralizing. There are things only government can accomplish, and getting those done made the work worthwhile, even when they (often) took longer than expected.

Over the years I've developed as a programmer, and they've radically changed the way baseball is played. Pitchers used to try to pitch a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_game">complete game</a>, but now that never happens. Sometimes they take a pitcher out in the first inning if he's pitched over say 70 pitches, because there's no point, what he's doing obviously isn't working, and he's getting close to the maximum pitches they'd let him do, esp if he's young and a hot prospect, they don't want to burn him out. I find that no matter what, after four hours of development work I start getting sloppy, and I can't think big picture as I could in the beginning of the session. I'm trying to finish things up for the day, and leave myself in a good place to pick up in the next session. And like a pitcher you have to stay focused. The phone doesn't ring for the pitcher when he's on the mound, that's why programmers, good ones, who are performing at or near their limit of ability to focus, so totally don't welcome interruptions.

At first, if you're roughly my age, you read "They took paradise and..." and recognize it as the beginning of a famous line from Joni Mitchell's <a href="https://genius.com/Joni-mitchell-big-yellow-taxi-lyrics">Big Yellow Taxi</a>. The other is a subtle touch of sarcasm, that I usually try not to indulge in, but let pass through as I edited this piece. See if you can <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/28/140604.html">find</a> it.

      It's the 20th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina which wiped out New Orleans, a major American city, which I knew because I went to college there. I went there in December 2005 to get an idea of what a post-apocalyptic American city looks like. On the flight from Atlanta to New Orleans, a <a href="http://static2.podcatch.com/blogs/gems/snedit/cn05Dec13.mp3">50-minute podcast</a> with Janet, a woman who lost her house and all her possessions in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakeview,_New_Orleans#Hurricane_Katrina">Lakeview</a> section of New Orleans. It's quite possible this and the <a href="http://static2.podcatch.com/blogs/gems/snedit/cn05Dec16.mp3">one that followed</a> were the only contemporary podcasts about Katrina, because in 2005 there wasn't all that much podcasting going on. You can see these episodes in the <a href="https://morningcoffeenotes.com/">Morning Coffee Notes</a> program listing.

And the Mets, my team since 1962, are really exciting right now, after a month of being lost. They have great rookie pitchers who are full of youthful enthusiasm and they kick ass on the mound. They have veterans who understand their job is to lead and they take that responsibility seriously, and they get on base, steal bases, and hit home runs. And they have workaday athletes who get on base when the team needs a hit. And the most expensive player ever in any sport who's finally playing as part of the team and not someone who misses the old team he used to play on. And they still have the most ridiculously dorky mascot, a caricature of a human with a baseball for a head, and his wife who also has a baseball for a head. Where do they come up with these ideas? Doesn't matter it's the M-E-T-S of New York town who we will now step right up to meet, and greet.</p>

      Everything Trump is doing to steal the next election is proof of why <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_v._Anderson">Colorado</a> was right to deny him a place on the 2024 ballot. The Supremes gave him four years to prepare, to learn from his mistakes, now he'll do it from the top seat. It seems certain to work.

      <h1>Git diagramming "The Weave"</h1>

(date: 2025-08-31, from: <a href="https://daverupert.com/2025/08/git-diagramming-the-weave/">Dave Rupert blog</a>)
      <p>
      <p>We all know the current US President is one hell of an orator and often assures us that he has “the best words”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I went to an Ivy League school. I’m very highly educated. I know words. I have the best words.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The man knows words. Says so right there. While some might view his non-sequitur ramblings as the nascent stages of dementia or an unfiltered ADHD brain launching into successive short (at times racist) bullet-point diatribes based on the last word or phrase he said like a cursed game of word association, the President asserts this is not the case:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You know, I do the weave. You know what the weave is? I’ll talk about, like, nine different things, and they all come back brilliantly together. And it’s like - and friends of mine that are, like, English professors - they say, it’s the most brilliant thing I’ve ever seen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“<a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/09/13/nx-s1-5107714/breaking-down-former-president-donald-trumps-rambling-linguistic-style">The Weave</a>” re-entered my consciousness this week after I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_Ds1Cz-LpA">a quick snippet of an Oval Office event</a> where Trump says the (“radical left-wing”) CBO projects tariffs will reduce the deficit by $4 trillion USD. I was skeptical –<a href="https://youtu.be/ab9yLd3OjSw">and for good reason</a>– but I tuned in. What shocked me was not the complete lack of specifics about the CBO projection, but rather the actual reason for the Oval Office meeting: a FIFA event? Wow.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/E_Ds1Cz-LpA?si=cBQ0UPVzaiISw4ho" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>For awhile now, I’ve clued into the cyclical pattern of his speeches, little snippets of “the best words” and talking points assembled like a ransom note cut from a magazine. I often wondered if it’s possible to diagram “the weave”. The “branching” narratives Trump uses made me think a git-graph-style visualization was apropos. So I grabbed a transcript and got to work.</p>
<p>For my first attempt, I used <a href="https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/gitgraph.html">Mermaid.js’ GitGraph Diagram</a> which worked well but only supports horizontal charts. As I sat with it I realized I wanted a chronological list of statements that read like a transcript. I repurposed the Mermaid’s GitGraph DSL and made a web component called <code>&lt;git-graph&gt;</code> to help me visualize and document Trump’s derailing trains of thought from the above event.</p>

<p>By my count in that four-minute address there were ten distinct themes or “branches”, most of which are common grievances or rhetorical themes found in nearly all Trump speeches. I used “cherry-picking” to model callbacks to a previous statement (e.g. “the stock market is up”) that seem to reverberate into later trains of thought, a quintessential feature of the weave.</p>
<p>Four minutes of the weave was about all I could handle but I think this visualization models what I experience when trying to follow along to the President’s speeches. One or two phrases on a topic, then jumping to a new topic, weaving in a (sometimes unrelated) point from a previous topic to make the thought appear more cohesive and linear, then driving deep down an inconsequential topic. When he talks so long about ten different topics at a time, I’d forgive you for thinking he said something salient. But when you break it down you see it for what it is: a mishmash of talking points.</p>

      <h1>The Invisibles</h1>

(date: 2025-08-30, from: <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/22100">Jeremy Keith Blog</a>)
      <p>
      
<p>When I was talking about <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/22099">monitoring web performance yesterday</a>, I linked to the <a href="https://treo.sh/sitespeed/thesession.org">CrUX data for The Session</a>.</p>

<p>CrUX is a contraction of Chrome User Experience Report. CrUX just sounds better than CEAR.</p>

<p>It’s data gathered from actual Chrome users worldwide. It can be handy as part of a balanced performance-monitoring diet, but it’s always worth remembering that it only shows a subset of your users; those on Chrome.</p>

<p>The actual CrUX data is imprisoned in some hellish Google interface so some kindly people have put more humane interfaces on it. I like <a href="https://calibreapp.com/tools/core-web-vitals-test/thesession.org">Calibre’s CrUX tool</a> as well as <a href="https://treo.sh/sitespeed/thesession.org">Treo’s</a>.</p>

<p>What’s nice is that you can look at the numbers for any reasonably popular website, not just your own. Lest I get too smug about the performance metrics for <a href="https://thesession.org/">The Session</a>, I can compare them to <a href="https://treo.sh/sitespeed/en.wikipedia.org">the numbers for WikiPedia</a> or <a href="https://treo.sh/sitespeed/www.bbc.co.uk">the BBC</a>. Both of those sites are made by people who prioritise speed, and it shows.</p>

<p>If you scroll down to the numbers on navigation types, you’ll see something interesting. Across the board, whether it’s The Session, Wikipedia, or the BBC, the BFcache—back/forward cache—is used around 16% to 17% of the time. This is when users use the back button (or forward button).</p>

<p>Unless you do something to stop them, browsers will make sure that those navigations are super speedy. You might inadvertently be <a href="https://web.dev/articles/bfcache">sabotaging the BFcache</a> if you’re sending a <code>Cache-Control: no-store</code> header or if you’re using an <code>unload</code> event handler in JavaScript.</p>

<p>I guess it’s unsurprising the BFcache numbers are relatively consistent across three different websites. People are people, whatever website they’re browsing.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://treo.sh/sitespeed/thesession.org">The Session</a></li>
<li><a href="https://treo.sh/sitespeed/en.wikipedia.org">WikiPedia</a></li>
<li><a href="https://treo.sh/sitespeed/www.bbc.co.uk">The BBC</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Where it gets interesting is in the differences. Take a look at pre-rendering. It’s 4% for the BBC and just 0.4% for Wikipedia. But on The Session it’s a whopping 35%!</p>

<p>That’s because I’m using <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/21139">speculation rules</a>. They’re quite straightforward to implement and they pair beautifully with full-page view transitions for a slick, speedy user experience.</p>

<p>It doesn’t look like WikiPedia or the BBC are using speculation rules at all, which kind of surprises me.</p>

<p>Then again, because they’re a hidden technology I can understand why they’d slip through the cracks.</p>

<p>On any web project, I think it’s worth having a checklist of The Invisibles—things that aren’t displayed directly in the browser, but that can make a big difference to the user experience.</p>

<p>Some examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Manifest">web application manifest</a> JSON file to help people install your website.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://goingoffline.adactio.com/">service worker</a>, even if it’s just to cache static assets.</li>
<li>Open Graph <a href="https://metatags.io/"><code>meta</code> elements</a> in the <code>head</code> of documents so they “unroll” nicely when the link is shared.</li>
<li>An appropriate <a href="https://content-security-policy.com/">content security policy</a> header.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Speculation_Rules_API"><code>Speculation-Rules</code></a> header that points to a JSON file.</li>
<li>An <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XML/Guides/OpenSearch">OpenSearch XML file</a> if your site has search functionality.</li>
<li>An icon, or as us olds call it, a favicon.</li>
<li>A <code>lang</code> attribute on the <code>body</code> of every page.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’ve got a checklist like that in place, you can at least ask “Whose job is this?” All too often, these things are missing because there’s no clarity on whose responsible for them. They’re sorta back-end and sorta front-end.</p>

      Not much  computing in August.  I decided  to have ACTUAL  holidays. In last (many) years it was rather different. Few one-day trips but mostly being at work (or  working from home) all the time.  Not as actively as normally but working.

      <h1>Databasing</h1>

(date: 2025-08-29, from: <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/22099">Jeremy Keith Blog</a>)
      <p>
      
<p>A few years back, Craig wrote a great piece called <a href="https://craigmod.com/essays/fast_software/">Fast Software, the Best Software</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Speed in software is probably the most valuable, least valued asset. To me, speedy software is the difference between an application smoothly integrating into your life, and one called upon with great reluctance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nelson Elhage said much the same thing in his <a href="https://blog.nelhage.com/post/reflections-on-performance/">reflections on software performance</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’ve really come to appreciate that performance isn’t just some property of a tool independent from its functionality or its feature set. Performance — in particular, being notably fast — is a feature in and of its own right, which fundamentally alters how a tool is used and perceived.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or, <a href="https://css-tricks.com/accessibility-and-web-performance-are-not-features-theyre-the-baseline/">as Robin put it</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don’t think a website can be good until it’s fast.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those sentiments underpin <a href="https://thesession.org/">The Session</a>. Speed is as much a priority as usability, accessibility, <a href="https://thesession.org/privacy">privacy</a>, and security.</p>

<p>I’m fortunate in that the site doesn’t have an underlying business model at odds with these priorities. I’m under no pressure to add <a href="https://adactio.com/articles/18676">third-party code that would track users and slow down the website</a>.</p>

<p>When it comes to making fast websites, most of the obstacles are put in place by front-end development, mostly JavaScript. I’ve been pretty ruthless in my pursuit of speed on The Session, <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/20448">removing as much JavaScript as possible</a>. On the bigger pages, the bottleneck now is DOM size rather than parsing and excuting JavaScript. As bottlenecks go, it’s not the worst.</p>

<p>But even with all my core web vitals looking good, I still have an issue that can’t be solved with front-end optimisations. <a href="https://calibreapp.com/tools/core-web-vitals-test/thesession.org#ttfb">Time to first byte</a> (or TTFB if you’d rather use an initialism that takes just as long to say as the words it’s replacing).</p>

<p>When it comes to <a href="https://csswizardry.com/2019/08/time-to-first-byte-what-it-is-and-why-it-matters/">reducing the time to first byte</a>, there are plenty of factors that are out of my control. But in the case of The Session, something I do have control over is the server set-up, specifically the database.</p>

<p>Now I could probably solve a lot of my speed issues by throwing money at the problem. If I got a bigger better server with more RAM and CPUs, I’m pretty sure it would improve the time to first byte. But my wallet wouldn’t thank me.</p>

<p>(It’s still worth acknowledging that this is a perfectly valid approach when it comes to back-end optimisation that isn’t available on the front end; you can’t buy all your users new devices.)</p>

<p>So I’ve been spending some time really getting to grips with the MySQL database that underpins The Session. It was already normalised and indexed to the hilt. But perhaps there were server settings that could be tweaked.</p>

<p>This is where I have to give a shout-out to <a href="https://releem.com/">Releem</a>, a service that is <em>exactly</em> what I needed. It monitors your database and then over time suggests configuration tweaks, explaining each one along the way. It’s a seriously good service that feels as empowering as it is useful.</p>

<p>I wish I could afford to use Releem on an ongoing basis, but luckily there’s a free trial period that I could avail of.</p>

<p>Thanks to Releem, I was also able to see which specific queries were taking the longest. There was one in particular that had always bothered me…</p>

<p>If you’re a member of The Session, then you can see any activity related to something you submitted in the past. Say, for example, that you added a tune or an event to the site a while back. If someone else comments on that, or bookmarks it, then that shows up in your “notifications” feed.</p>

<p>That’s all well and good but under the hood it was relying on a fairly convuluted database query to a very large table (a table that’s effectively a log of all user actions). I tried all sorts of query optimisations but there always seemed to be some combination of circumstances where the request would take ages.</p>

<p>For a while I even removed the notifications functionality from the site, hoping it wouldn’t be missed. But a couple of people wrote to ask where it had gone so I figured I ought to reinstate it.</p>

<p>After exhausting all the technical improvements, I took a step back and thought about the <em>purpose</em> of this particular feature. That’s when I realised that I had been thinking about the database query too literally.</p>

<p>The results are ordered in reverse chronological order, which makes sense. They’re also chunked into groups of ten, which also makes sense. But I had allowed for the possibility that you could navigate through your notifications back to the very start of your time on the site.</p>

<p>But that’s not really how we think of notifications in other settings. What would happen if I were to limit your notifications only to activity in, say, the last month?</p>

<p>Boom! Instant performance improvement by orders of magnitude.</p>

<p>I guess there’s a lesson there about switching off the over-analytical side of my brain and focusing on actual user needs.</p>

<p>Anyway, thanks to the time I’ve spent honing the database settings and optimising the longest queries, I’ve reduced the latency by quite a bit. I’m hoping that will result in an improvement to the time to first byte.</p>

<p>Time—and <a href="https://treo.sh/sitespeed/thesession.org">monitoring tools</a>—will tell.</p>

      <h1>Bronx Science, in retrospect</h1>

(date: 2025-08-29, from: <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/29/151308.html?title=bronxScienceInRetrospect">Dave Winer's Scripting News</a>)
      <p>
      <p>Story. I'm on a mail list for Berkman, where I spent two years at Harvard. Alumnae of all generations are on this list, and it's interesting.</p>
<p>Just got an email that someone was proud of having their picture taken with Susan Landau. I didn't know who she was, so I <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Landau">looked her up</a>.</p>
<p>She was born in 1954. And is a highly accomplished math and comp sci wizard, with cred at Harvard, Google, and now teaches at Tufts. </p>
<p>Then I get to the place where they say she went to <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22Bronx%20Science%22">Bronx Science</a>. </p>
<p>That was my class, unless she, like I, skipped a grade. We both would have started in 1969 and graduated in 1972.</p>
<p>I just wanted to write this up because I've noticed in the last few years, now that I live in the northeast, not far from the Bronx, I tend to come across more Science alums, and when I do, I generally find we have a lot to talk about, and share a New York style nerd sense of humor. </p>
<p>And as a math major myself, I conclude that their test was pretty good, it definitely selected a certain kind of mind, and the people it selected generally went on to do interesting, creative and useful things. </p>

      <p>
      <h4>A remarkable mixture of different components, but it works</h4>
      <p>RefreshOS is a Debian and KDE-based distro with a difference: it casts its net a lot wider for tools and components.</p>

Glad to finally get the whole plan down in one place. Each piece of the puzzle took a while to come together in concept and then in implementation. I'm still working on all levels, last week I added a feature to <a href="https://feedland.com/">FeedLand</a> that makes it fit in better with the (new) timeline and WordPress (20+ years). It takes a while to change your thinking from WordPress being just another blogging CMS, to being an open platform that hosts <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/03/13/132830.html">web writing</a> in a way that's open to competition. We're on the same page. It's still a competitive environment, but there are rules to competing, you don't cash in the interop that took patience and respect to develop and maintain. That's been the pity of the open web, lots of opportunists who are willing to stink up the ecosystem to squeeze a few more bucks for themselves from things <i>they didn't create.</i> Let your competitors in, and the users, if they have their heads screwed on right, will respect you for it. And even if they don't, still do it, because it's the right thing to do. That's why, at my age, just turned 70 earlier this year, I'm in a position to help revive the web, because I've made enough money, now it's time to make sure the gift that I got from the open web is available to future generations, no matter how greedy and selfish the <a href="https://daveverse.org/2025/08/29/the-wealthy-and-dominant-giants-of-tech/">giants of tech</a> are. People may question Matt, and that's cool, as I said <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/28/140604.html#a142100">yesterday</a>, but also remember he's stood up for your freedom, and that's also important.

      <p>
      <p>I just heard about <a href="https://www.fodors.com/news/news/there-are-warnings-about-the-bag-tag-scam-but-is-it-really-a-scam">this</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>There&#8217;s a <a href="https://travelnoire.com/luggage-tag-scam">travel scam warning</a> going around the internet right now: You should keep your baggage tags on your bags until you get home, then shred them, because scammers are using luggage tags to file fraudulent claims for missing baggage with the airline.</p></blockquote>
<p>First, the scam is possible. I had a bag destroyed by baggage handlers on a recent flight, and all the information I needed to file a claim was on my luggage tag. I have no idea if I will successfully get any money from the airline, or what form it will be in, or how it will be tied to my name, but at least the first step is possible...</p>

I'm going to be introducing a very weird idea about WordPress, one that's going to bend your mind a lot, especially if you're a member of the WordPress community, but also if you're a developer who has used WordPress in an application sometime in the last 20 years, or a user who has used it to keep a blog, or to run a business website, or just someone who hangs around the web. It's famous, but not in the way I'm going to present it. I'm going to ask you to see WordPress the same way you think of Mastodon or Bluesky. It's a way of storing realtime text and graphics, and arrange them by time, and read and write them, subscribe to people, comment on what others have written, communicate with other people you find on a twitter-like network. If you look at the actual sofware, you'll see that WordPress and the other two systems have very similar features. They all store messages. And arrange them chronologically and in relation to other messages and people. But WordPress does it better.</p>

      <p>
      Kagi has quickly grown into something of a _household name_ within tech
circles. From _Hacker News_ and _Lobsters_ to _Reddit_, the search provider
seems to attract near-universal praise. Whenever the topic of _search engines_
comes up, there's an almost ritual rush to be the first to recommend Kagi,
often followed by a chorus of replies echoing the endorsement.

I'm going to be introducing a very weird idea about WordPress, one that's going to bend your mind a lot, especially if you're a member of the WordPress community, but also if you're a developer who has used WordPress in an application sometime in the last 20 years, or a user who has used it to keep a blog, or to run a business website, or just someone who hangs around the web. It's famous, but not in the way I'm going to present it. I'm going to ask you to see WordPress the same way you think of Mastodon or Bluesky. It's a way of storing realtime text and graphics, and arrange them by time, and read and write them, subscribe to people, comment on what others have written, communicate with other people you find on a twitter-like network. If you look at the actual sofware, you'll see that WordPress and the other two systems have very similar features. They all store messages. And arrange them chronologically and in relation to other messages and people. But WordPress does it better.

      <h1>Big bird in my pool</h1>

(date: 2025-08-28, from: <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/28/133314.html?title=bigBirdInMyPool">Dave Winer's Scripting News</a>)
      <p>
      <p>Last week I did an unusual podcast about three huge birds fighting over a fish in a nearby pond. Usually I write and talk about technology or politics, but this was such a compelling story and I didn't have any photos or video, so I did a verbal story. Hope you enjoyed it. Well now I have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztxgN2uUYAU">video</a>! </p>
<p>On Tuesday I went out to my pool, there was one of the big birds, in the pool. He couldn't get out. The pool is fenced in, as it must be, to keep animals and children from drowning, and the fence was too tall for the bird to fly out, or so it seemed. When it spotted me, it freaked out and tried to squeeze through the fence, which was impossible, the holes in the fence were too small for his sizeable body. </p>
<p>The bird did eventually manage to fly out, thankfully -- maybe I'll do another verbal podcast to explain why that was such an accomplishment. But for right now I just want to share the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztxgN2uUYAU">video</a>.  </p>

      <h1>Dottie: a native macOS pixel art editor (WIP)</h1>

(date: 2025-08-28, from: <a href="https://blog.gingerbeardman.com/2025/08/28/dottie-native-macos-pixel-art-editor-wip/">Matt Sephton blog</a>)
      <p>
      <p>For the past several months I’ve been working on a pixel art app for macOS, with the goal of making it as much of a first class citizen and great Mac-like experience as possible. To that end it is fully native and built using Swift and SwiftUI, with a tiny bit of AppKit.</p>

<p>As with all the macOS apps I build, they start with a personal need. This one was to replace the aging and unsupported <a href="/2023/05/10/piskel-for-playdate/">Piskel electron/web app</a>. I like it and I loathe it, so I wondered if I could do better. My friend <a href="https://jbmorley.co.uk/about/">Jason Morley</a> was the additional momentum I needed to actually get moving and try some things out—so thanks Jason!</p>

<h2 id="a-little-bit-of-history-repeating">A little bit of history repeating</h2>

<p>I’ve been into pixel art since <a href="/about">Deluxe Paint ST</a> (yes, on Atari ST not Commodore Amiga!), and of course on the classic Macintosh. I also collect <a href="/2023/10/21/list-of-vintage-japanese-pixel-dot-art-software/">information about the multitude of Japanese “dot art” pixel art apps</a>, which are quite different to the apps that I grew up with. All this to say that I already had a list of features I missed, pined for, or otherwise thought should make a return. <a href="/2024/07/14/shibuya-pixel-art-contest-2024/#bonus">Naturally</a>, dithering should be a tent pole feature affecting all tools.</p>

<p>A dither smudge like the one shown below was last seen by me in 1992’s Multi Paint System (PC-98).</p>

<lite-youtube style="aspect-ratio: 320/243;" videoid="XKyDG7aF3xU" params="start=0&amp;modestbranding=2">
</lite-youtube>

<hr />

<h2 id="look-mano-dependencies">Look, Ma—no dependencies!</h2>

<p>And as an additional constraint—<a href="/2023/11/21/yoyozo-how-i-made-a-playdate-game-in-39kb/">which you may know I love to set for myself</a>—I decided that I would use no packages or external dependencies, just system frameworks. Yes, that means I had to write my own colour picker (but, that’s my idea of a good time!) and some things took longer than just adding a package, but I can say that there is precious little wasted code inside this app. In fact, at the time of writing a single-architecture build of the app that has been readied for distribution still fits on a <a href="/2025/05/19/media-darling-t-shirt-design/">3.5” 2HD floppy disk</a>!</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="pre-mortem">Pre-mortem</h2>

<p>A full post-mortem will come after release.</p>

<p>The trickiest parts of development so far:</p>
<ul>
  <li>drawing pixelated circles of any width and height (all the classic graphics programming text books require the circle to have odd dimensions so that the coordinate of the centre pixel is an integer)</li>
  <li>figuring out the intricacies of the document-based application model</li>
  <li>trying to get the “New Document” button to appear on the file selector that appears at app launch (in fact this one still evades me for reasons I can’t figure out, <a href="/support">get in touch if you can help</a>!)</li>
  <li>automating help book compilation (<a href="https://marioaguzman.wordpress.com/2020/09/12/auth/">thanks Mario</a>!)</li>
  <li>performance bottlenecks with some aspects of SwiftUI (thanks <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc25/labs/overview/">WWDC Lab</a>!)</li>
  <li>surprise performance gains from using AppKit for better gestures</li>
  <li>selections and marching ants</li>
  <li>dealing with some bad early decisions (tech debt)</li>
</ul>

<p>The most fun aspects so far:</p>
<ul>
  <li>designing and iterating on the UI</li>
  <li>coming up with a name and brand</li>
  <li>implementing palette management and trying new ideas</li>
  <li>implementing a custom colour picker, twice</li>
  <li>drawing the various tool and app icons</li>
  <li>getting to a point where it feels done and every new feature is icing on the cake</li>
</ul>

<p>One interesting thing about the app:</p>
<ul>
  <li>there is no settings window</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="launching-late-2025">Launching late-2025</h2>

<p>I hope to launch the app this autumn, but until then: if you’re a pixel artist feel free to <a href="/support">get in touch</a> with your email address and I’ll send you a TestFlight invite!</p>

<p>Put the kettle on. This is a long one!</p>

<p>Matt takes a trip down memory lane and looks at all the frontend tools, technologies, and techniques that have come and gone over the years.</p>

<p>But this isn’t about nostalgia (although it does make you appreciate how far we’ve come). He’s looking at whether anything from the past is worth keeping today.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Studying past best practices and legacy systems is crucial for understanding the evolution of technology and making informed decisions today.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://nooshu.com/blog/2025/08/26/hack-to-the-future-frontend/#11-what-still-matters-progressive-enhancement">There’s only one technique that makes the cut</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After discussing countless legacy approaches and techniques best left in the past, you’ve finally arrived at a truly timeless and Incredibly important methodology.</p>

      <h1>Plot for a political sci fi comedy</h1>

Kind of like Robin Williams, from the planet you come from, but he's a centipede and only breathes what you would think of as Chef Boyardee lasagna, but it's not really that, it's different. </p>
<p>Anyway, he's old, 757 centuries give or take, and they're expecting him to die soon, and they can elect someone boring so they can forget about politics. Everyone is looking forward to the relaxation. </p>
<p>And then one day he does die, and everyone breathes a huge sigh of relief, until later that night, on the 10-screen equivalent of what you would think of as TV, hilarity ensues when the "dead" PM showed up, looking fit, young and dashing, doing slapstick and talking about how he's going to make a mess of something. </p>
<p>Everyone was furious and then puzzled, we thought he was dead -- until the rumor started going around that the scientists had invented a sort of "artificial" thing that could perfectly emulate anyone or anything, including a Lasagna-breathing centipede comic despot from planet Y of star Z in the X galaxy. Everyone was pissed, but mostly agreed the PM was still pretty funny.</p>
<p>End of pilot. </p>

On the web seemed relatively easy. But of the web is a bit more elusive. Until <a href="https://x.com/KenSmith/status/1960475445457039601">Ken Smith</a> found <a href="https://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html#:~:text=%22Hypertext%22%20is%20a%20term%20coined,together%20in%20an%20unconstrained%20way">this quote</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Nelson">Ted Nelson</a> in the original 1989 proposal by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a> for what would become the web. "Human-readable information linked together in an unconstrained way." I like this, because it, like the definition I came up with for <a href="https://archive.blogs.harvard.edu/whatmakesaweblogaweblog/">weblog</a>, talks about the activity as opposed to the technology. Human-readable is essential. And most essential is "unconstrained." If something requires a link, you should link to it. If you don't it ain't the web.

      <p>Nice <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/poisoned-document-could-leak-secret-data-chatgpt/">indirect prompt injection attack</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bargury&#8217;s attack starts with a poisoned document, which is <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2375057?hl=en-GB&#038;co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop">shared</a> to a potential victim&#8217;s Google Drive. (Bargury says a victim could have also uploaded a compromised file to their own account.) It looks like an official document on company meeting policies. But inside the document, Bargury hid a 300-word malicious prompt that contains instructions for ChatGPT. The prompt is written in white text in a size-one font, something that a human is unlikely to see but a machine will still read.</p>

      W. David Marx writes, related to labubus and AI slop: &#8220;We&#8221; — consumers who desire complexity and innovation — are giving so much of &#8220;our&#8221; attention to things we hold in contempt. Marx is mostly talking about junk culture, mass culture, but I also think this applies to purity policing of cultural works, especially writing. [&#8230;]

      I get mildly annoyed when I see &#8220;best of&#8221; booklists with nothing on them that I&#8217;ve read because I&#8217;m not into literary fiction and almost exclusively read genre fiction.

      Yesterday, I intended to write about the Nineteenth Amendment prohibiting states from denying women the right to vote because today is the anniversary of the amendment&#8217;s certification in 1920.

      I think perhaps I should have one day every week where I never link to anything. Just to provide a demo of what the web would be like without linking. Which is most of the sites that say they are part of the web. I think that's a lie we should stop tolerating. Or maybe I should just stop offsite linking for one day a week. That would be interesting wouldn't it. Or I could charge extra for the version with the links. (It's very rare that I charge anything to use any of my web work, but I <i>have</i> done that at times.)

      I'm working my way through Mr Robot, for the third time I think. If you want to know what I do, it's like what Elliot does, for about four hours pretty much every day. I used to work longer hours but I've found this amount of work is optimal. I make more mistakes after about 1PM. Anyway Mr Robot is a very good thing to watch for the times we live in. The technology is already a little outdated, but they thought of that, there are some scenes where they use old PCs from the 80s, with total respect. I like that. And the utilities he uses are pretty much the same ones I use these days. And the context of a world in technological meltdown, I think that's a very realistic scenario. I don't see how our networks can't avoid breaking down. And our health care system, which these days is pretty much the same thing.

      <h1>Newsletters</h1>

(date: 2025-08-26, from: <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/22093">Jeremy Keith Blog</a>)
      <p>
      
<p><a href="https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/newslettered/">Ethan tagged me in a post</a>. I didn’t feel a thing.</p>

<p>“I’d love to invite a few other folks to share their favorite newsletters”, he wrote.</p>

<p>My immediate thought was that I don’t actually subscribe to many newsletters. But then I remembered that most newsletters are available as RSS feeds, and I very much <em>do</em> subscribe to those.</p>

<p>Reading RSS and reading email feel very different to me. A new item in my email client feels like a task. A new item in my feed reader feels like a gift.</p>

<p>Anyway, I poked around in <a href="https://adactio.com/feeds/subscriptions/">my subscriptions</a> and found some newsletters in there that I can heartily recommend.</p>

<p>First and foremost, there’s <a href="https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/">The History Of The Web</a> by Jay Hoffman. Each newsletter is a building block for the timeline of the web that he’s putting together. It’s very much up my alley.</p>

<p>On the topic of the World Wide Web, <a href="https://matthiasott.com/">Matthias</a> has a newsletter called <a href="https://buttondown.com/ownyourweb">Own Your Web</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whether you want to get started with your own personal website or level up as a designer, developer, or independent creator working with the ever-changing material of the Web, this little email is for you. ❤✊</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the inescapable topic of “AI”, I can recommend <a href="https://buttondown.com/maiht3k">Mystery AI Hype Theater 3000: The Newsletter</a> by Professor Emily M. Bender and Doctor Alex Hanna.</p>

<p>Journalist <a href="https://www.clivethompson.net/">Clive Thompson</a> has a fun newsletter called <a href="https://buttondown.com/clivethompson">The Linkfest</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The opposite of doomscrolling: Every two weeks (roughly) I send you a collection of the best Internet reading I&#8217;ve found &#8212; links to culture, technology, art and science that fascinated me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you like that, you’ll love <a href="https://thewhippet.org/">The Whippet</a> by <a href="https://mckinleyvalentine.com/">McKinley Valentine</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A newsletter for the terminally curious</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay, now there are three more newsletters that I like, but I’m hesitant to recommend for the simple reason that they’re on <a href="https://leavesubstack.com/">Substack</a> alongside a pile of racist trash. If you decide you like any of these, please don’t subscribe by email; use the RSS feed. For the love of Jeebus, don’t give Substack your email address.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ageofinvention.xyz/">Age of Invention</a> by Anton Howes is a deep, deep dive into the history of technology and industry:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m interested in everything from the exploits of sixteenth-century alchemists to the schemes of Victorian engineers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Finally, there are two newsletters written by people whose music I listened to in my formative years in Ireland…</p>

<p><a href="https://paulpage.substack.com/">When We Were Young</a> by Paul Page recounts his time in the band <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IutkqyUU5o">Whipping Boy</a> in the ’90s:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This will be the story of Whipping Boy told from my perspective.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=popslMUM_mE">Toasted Heretic</a> were making very different music around the same time as Whipping Boy. Their singer <a href="https://www.juliangough.com/">Julian Gough</a> has gone on to write books, poems, and now a newsletter about cosmology called <a href="https://theeggandtherock.com/">The Egg And The Rock</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Egg and the Rock makes a big, specific argument (backed up by a lot of recent data, across many fields), that our universe appears to be the result of an evolutionary process at the level of universes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There you go—quite a grab bag of newsletter options for you.</p>

      The <a href="https://this.how/web/what.opml#1756211321000">consensus</a> among the people who responded to my what does "on the web" mean query is this. Something is on the web if it has a URL you can use to view it in a web browser. That means, in 2025, that the URL begins with HTTP or HTTPS. Every "page" on a site must have a URL so they can be pointed to independently, otherwise known as deep linking. It's not enough to just have a home page that's on the web. So for example, an iPhone app isn't on the web just because it has an information page that is.

<blockquote><p>Three Dutch security analysts discovered the vulnerabilities­&#8212;five in total&#8212;­in a European radio standard called TETRA (Terrestrial Trunked Radio), which is used in radios made by Motorola, Damm, Hytera, and others. The standard has been used in radios since the ’90s, but the flaws remained unknown because encryption algorithms used in TETRA were kept secret until now. </p></blockquote>

      <h1>Trump's secret was comedy</h1>

(date: 2025-08-25, from: <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/08/25/212400.html?title=trumpsSecretWasComedy">Dave Winer's Scripting News</a>)
      <p>
      <p>Trump is a comedian. He makes people laugh the way Joan Rivers or Don Rickles did. </p>
<p>It's verbal slapstick, which is for some reason I don't understand immensely funny and entertaining.</p>
<p>Newsom is making us laugh by imitating Trump imitating Joan and Don. It's working. He must keep doing it, and he should evolve the schtick, he should make Trump match <i>him. </i>And where Trump is promoting depraved policies with his comedy, we can count on Newsom to stand up for the Constitution and the rule of law and all the progress we've made. </p>
<p>He can invite famous comedians on his podcast to play opposite him, sometimes the straight man, playing their SNL roles. So much potential. He's got the attention, don't throw it away. </p>
<p>Politics was boring, it's not boring anymore. But there's no reason excitement and entertainment can't be good for us too! ;-)</p>
<p>Trump's secret is comedy and Newsom is stealing his thunder</p>

      <h1>Successive Prototypes Bridge the Gap Between Idea and Reality</h1>

(date: 2025-08-25, from: <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2025/idea-to-reality-with-prototypes/">Jim Nielsen blog</a>)
      <p>
      <p>Dismissing an idea because it doesn’t work in your head is doing a disservice to the idea.</p>
<p>(Same for dismissing someone else’s idea because it doesn’t work in your head.)</p>
<p>The only way to truly know if an idea works is to test it. </p>
<p>The gap between an idea and reality is the work. </p>
<p>You can’t dismiss something as “not working” without <em>doing</em> the work.</p>
<p>When collaborating with others, different ideas can be put forward which end up in competition with each other.</p>
<p>We debate which is best, but verbal descriptions don’t do justice to ideas — so the idea that wins is the one whose champion is the most persuasive (or has the most institutional authority).</p>
<p>You don’t want that. You want an environment where ideas can be evaluated based on their substance and not on the personal attributes of the person advocating them.</p>
<p>This is the value of prototypes. </p>
<p>We can’t visualize or predict how our own ideas will play out, let alone other people’s. This is why it’s necessary to bring them to life, have them take concrete form. It’s the only way to do them justice.</p>
<p>(Picture a cute puppy in your head. I’ve got one too. <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2019/the-power-of-prototypes-in-the-creative-process/" >Now how do we determine who’s imagining the cuter puppy?</a> We can’t. We have to produce a concrete manifestation for contrast and comparison.)</p>
<p>Prototypes are how we bridge the gap between idea and reality. They’re an iterative, evolutionary, exploratory form of birthing ideas that test their substance.</p>
<p>People will bow out to a good persuasive argument.</p>
<p>They’ll bow out to their boss saying it should be one way or another.</p>
<p>But it’s hard to bow out to a good idea you can see, taste, touch, smell, or use. </p>

      <h1>2025-08-18 Zürich Zoo</h1>

(date: 2025-08-25, from: <a href="https://alexschroeder.ch/view/2025-08-18-zoo">Alex Schroeder's Blog</a>)
      <p>
      <h1 id="2025-08-18-zürich-zoo">2025-08-18 Zürich Zoo</h1>

<p>We went to the Zürich Zoo.</p>

<p>We started in the Australian section where they have a bunch of wallabies.
You can enter the enclosure. There were three wallabies chasing each other, grunting.
We suspected it was related to intercourse but when they stopped there was just short attempt at it and then they all preferred to drink water instead.</p>

<p>This is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-necked_wallaby">red-necked wallaby</a>, <em>Notamacropus rufogriseus</em>.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-7.jpg" alt="A wallaby eating salad. The pink pouch is very visible." />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-8.jpg" alt="Wallaby head with backlight, showing the long whiskers." /></p>

<p>The same enclosure also has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emu">emus</a>, <em>Dromaius novaehollandiae</em>.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-9.jpg" alt="An emu head with backlight, showing the delicate feathers around its face." />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-10.jpg" alt="A super fluffy young (?) emu head." /></p>

<p>We went on to see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanaco">guanaco</a>, <em>Lama guanicoe</em>.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-11.jpg" alt="A wet guanaco who&rsquo;s been standing in a water spray to cool down." />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-12.jpg" alt="A super cute young guanaco with huge black eyes." /></p>

<p>Next we saw some strange birds with strange, featherless heads. It&rsquo;s the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_bald_ibis">northern bald ibis</a>, <em>Geronticus eremita</em>. These used to be extinct in Switzerland but now they&rsquo;re back. They migrate south and so for rewilding, people had to adopt them and then fly with them across the alps with some ultralight flying vehicles. These days they fly to southern Spain instead, I heard. You can find some pictures about the project <a href="https://www.srf.ch/wissen/natur-tiere/rueckkehr-des-waldrapps-die-kueken-sind-da-das-comeback-eines-schraegen-vogels">on the Swiss radio and television site</a>.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-13.jpg" alt="A bird with black feathers and a bald red head with patches of grey, with orange eyes and a typical long, bent ibis beak" /></p>

<p>We went to see the great cats because the zoo has a new setup wherein the tigers, lions and snow leopards move between enclosures every now and then. This keeps them more active because they smell the presence of the other great cats that were here before them. But as usual, the cats were asleep during the day.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-14.jpg" alt="A lioness&rsquo; paw. It big!" /></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s also an &ldquo;insect forest&rdquo; where you can step into a room with a bunch of branches full of stick insects and the like.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-15.jpg" alt="A green, leaf-like insect with plenty of thorns. This is the Heteropteryx dilatata." />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-16.jpg" alt="Sadly, I was unable to find anything about this insect on the zoo site. It&rsquo;s very large, green, and its wings look like leaves that it keeps close to the body." />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-17.jpg" alt="A big beetle seen from below. This is Mecynorhina ugandensis." /></p>

<p>When we went to eat a snack at the <em>Altes Klösterli</em> restaurant, we had a view at the back of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelada">gelada</a> enclosure, <em>Theropithecus gelada</em>.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-18.jpg" alt="A female monkey sitting in front of a male. She has a bright red patch of hairless skin on her breast looking like a very strange, red necklace." />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-19.jpg" alt="The male monkey has superb hairstyle, a bit like David Bowie in The Labyrinth." /></p>

<p>The elephants are great. There&rsquo;s a young one with its mother and its aunt, all Asian elephants, <em>Elephas maximus</em>.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-20.jpg" alt="A tiny elephant between two huge adults." />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-21.jpg" alt="The two sisters seem to like each other, pressing their faces against each other, while the little kid disappears behind them." /></p>

<p>The rhinos are nearby. These are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_white_rhinoceros">southern white rhinoceroses</a>, <em>Ceratotherium simum simum</em>. Closing time was approaching and these were the first rhinos to come back into their enclosure from the outside, where they mingle with some antelopes and giraffes.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-22.jpg" alt="The first rhino is looking into the enclosure and seeing humans on the other side, so it stops and tries to evaluate the situation." />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-23.jpg" alt="The head of a rhinoceros with a very, very large horn." /></p>

<p>Outside, more rhinos, antelopes, ostriches and giraffes were still out and about.</p>

<p>These are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reticulated_giraffe">reticulated giraffes</a>, <em>Giraffa reticulata</em> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_ostrich">South African ostriches</a>, <em>Struthio camelus australis</em>.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-24.jpg" alt="The heads of two giraffes with their huge black eyes " />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-25.jpg" alt="The head of an ostrich with its grey feathers." /></p>

<p>Nearby, the super cute <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meerkat">meerkat</a>, <em>Suricata suricatta</em>. One of them is always on the lookout.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-26.jpg" alt="The lookout is standing upright and looking at the horizon and the sky, not at the people." />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-27.jpg" alt="A meerkat baby!" /></p>

<p>And finally, on the way out, we walked through the Masoala hall. So beautiful!</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-4.jpg" alt="The Masoala hall, from one of the two towers. A green jungle below." />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-6.jpg" alt="A picture showing the walkway above the tree canopy connecting the two towers, with me standing there in the greenery." />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-5.jpg" alt="A passion flower growing on a handrail." /></p>

<p>The greatest moment was when we approached the bottom of one of the two towers. I walked around the corner and was looking at two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_ruffed_lemur">red ruffed lemurs</a>, <em>Varecia rubra</em>.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-3.jpg" alt="Two super cute lemurs with bright yellow eyes, black heads, red fur and black paws that look more like hands, and a long tail held up like a question-mark." />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-1.jpg" alt="The lemurs climbed up a stone wall and walked around me." />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-08-18-zoo-2.jpg" alt="The lemurs disappear into the jungle." /></p>

<p>And then, we left!</p>

      Given how the <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/media/5468568-trump-threatens-broadcast-networks-in-late-night-social-media-posts/">Trump's questions</a> impact their journalistic integrity, perhaps the correct response for ABC and NBC is to tear up the license and send it to Trump with their best wishes. And since CBS isn't mentioned, I don't see how a credible journalist can stay there.

      I've been following Mark Cuban's recent posts on Bluesky, coming up with constructive things successful entrepreneurs can do to help. I had a different idea. Apply for a fellowship at a university, away from where you live, maybe in a place you've always wanted to try. In your application say you bring your entrepreneurial experience, but you're leaving your money on the side. You're coming to the university with the idea of creating something collaboratively, bringing the entrepreneurial approach of startups to the mix of people you find among academics. You're there to learn from the teachers and the students, and help them understand what you do. Use your mind, experience, creativity, even your contacts, but leave the money at home. You can live in a nice house, drive a nice car, but eat in the places people in the university eat, go to the lectures, concerts, sporting events, in other words, go back to school with your new perspective, and make a <i>personal</i> contribution. It's much more satisfying than spending money is, I speak from experience. There's a different kind of success in the collaboration. Another way to test yourself and develop new perspectives and experience. I wrote about this a few years back in <a href="https://this.how/phoenix/">Developing Better Developers</a>.

      I've been exchanging emails and voicemails with <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/dpknauss/">Dan Knauss</a>, a longtime WordPress developer and one of the hosts of WordCamp Canada which I am speaking at in October. Learning a lot about the community and culture. I wonder, have I ever been part of a community that's over 20 years old? I can't think of one off the top of my head. I have gotten this far without knowing much about the WordPress community, other than what I've heard via Matt and what I've been able to infer from that. I've known Matt since he was a teenage boy wonder in the tech industry working at CNET and then as an entrepreneur. I think my point of view is a new one, I don't bring much baggage with me. I am generally sympathetic with Matt, having been the leader of the blogging world when it started, and found it a pretty thankless place, a position I was happy to relinquish in 2003 when I went to academia.

      There's a fresh release of the docs for the <a href="https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/api/">WordPress API</a> we use in WordLand. I actually liked that the docs were old and kind of dusty. It says that the engineering culture is to not mess around with things that developers have already built on. A lot of platforms break developers without much thought. I learned a long time ago that when you do that, you lose the interest of developers, understandably.

Ever since I&rsquo;m fighting the bots, I&rsquo;ve had to look at the web server stats and my <a href="/admin">admin</a> folder is full of small scripts. But if you&rsquo;re new to it all, how do you start?</p>

<h2 id="where-are-the-files">Where are the files?</h2>

<p>If you use Apache on Debian, the current log file is in <code>/var/log/apache2/access.log</code> so look for something similar. If you use nginx instead of Apache, it might be a folder like <code>/var/log/nginx</code>. The log file itself might be called differently, too.</p>

<h2 id="log-format">Log format</h2>

<p>The log file format can vary, too. If you use Apache on Debian, the log formats are set in <code>/etc/apache2/apache2.conf</code> using the <code>LogFormat</code> directive, and each virtual host can pick one of them using the <code>CustomLog</code> directive.
See <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/logs.html#accesslog">Log Files</a>.</p>

<p>In my case, I use a config file that sets the following:</p>

<pre><code>LogFormat &quot;%v:%p %h %l %u %t \&quot;%r\&quot; %&gt;s %O \&quot;%{Referer}i\&quot; \&quot;%{User-Agent}i\&quot; %&gt;D&quot; vhost_combined
CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log vhost_combined
</code></pre>

<p>This adds <code>%&gt;D</code> at the end of the format and is otherwise identical to the default <code>vhost_combined</code> format.
The format codes are documented on the <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_log_config.html#formats">mod_log_config</a> page.</p>

<p>And example line from my logs:</p>

<p><code>social.alexschroeder.ch:443 37.27.248.47 - - [21/Aug/2025:00:59:49 +0200] &quot;POST /users/alex/inbox HTTP/1.1&quot; 202 4207 &quot;-&quot; &quot;Mastodon/4.4.2 (http.rb/5.3.1; +https://beige.party/)&quot; 33180</code></p>

<p>This means:</p>

<ul>
<li>a request to host <code>social.alexschroeder.ch</code> on port <code>443</code></li>
<li>from IP address <code>37.27.248.47</code></li>
<li>with no remote log name</li>
<li>and no remote user</li>
<li>on 2025-08-21 00:59:49 CEST</li>
<li>posted information to <code>/users/alex/inbox</code> (to read information the request would have used <code>GET</code> instead of <code>POST</code>)</li>
<li>the response was a status 202 (see <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status">HTTP response status codes</a> for a list)</li>
<li>and contained 4207 bytes</li>
<li>with no referrer provided</li>
<li>from a Mastodon user agent self-identifying as from beige.party</li>
<li>taking 33180 microseconds, or about 33 milliseconds (this is the information I added)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="processing-the-log-using-awk">Processing the log using <code>awk</code></h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to use <code>awk</code> to process the log files. It&rsquo;s a very old programming language.</p>

<p>Every line is split into words based on spaces. Each word is numbered and available as a variable starting with the dollar sign and its number. Therefore, when processing the <code>access.log</code> file using the format shown above, the number variables contain the following:</p>

<pre><code> $1  social.alexschroeder.ch:443
 $2  37.27.248.47
 $3  -
 $4  -
 $5  [21/Aug/2025:00:59:49
 $6  +0200]
 $7  &quot;POST
 $8  /users/alex/inbox
 $9  HTTP/1.1&quot;
$10  202
$11  4207
</code></pre>

<p>You&rsquo;ll note that those square brackets and double quotes are sometimes very annoying. 🤨</p>

<p>A block is enclosed in braces <code>{ like this }</code> and is executed for every line. You don&rsquo;t need to declare variables before assigning to them. An element of a an associative array (a hash map in Perl or Java, a Dictionary in Python) is accessed using square brackets <code>like[this]</code>.</p>

<p>A block after <code>END</code> is executed just once, at the end of the input.</p>

<h2 id="counting-the-hits-per-ip-number">Counting the hits per IP number</h2>

<p>We use an associative array where the key is the IP address of the visitor and the value is the number of hits. At the end, we print the number hits, a tab, and the IP address, for every address. The <code>++</code> operator increments the operand by one. <code>$2</code> is the IP address, and <code>hits</code> is the associative array.</p>

<p>We then use <code>sort --sort-numerically --reverse</code> to sort these lines by their hits, putting more hits at the top. <code>head --lines=20</code> then prints the first 20 lines.</p>

<pre><code>awk '{hits[$2]++} END {for (ip in hits) printf &quot;%d\t%s\n&quot;, hits[ip], ip}' /var/log/apache2/access.log \
| sort --numeric-sort --reverse \
| head --lines=20
</code></pre>

<h2 id="counting-the-bytes-per-ip-number-the-bandwidth-used">Counting the bytes per IP number (the bandwidth used)</h2>

<p>In order to sum the bandwidth used, we need to sum the bytes send per IP number.
The <code>awk</code> script here does that and prints the number of MB (1000000 bytes) per IP number.</p>

<p>We then use <code>sort --sort-numerically --reverse</code> to sort these lines by their hits, putting more volume at the top. <code>head --lines=20</code> then prints the first 20 lines.</p>

<pre><code>awk '{vol[$2] += $11} END {for (ip in vol) printf &quot;%dM\t%s\n&quot;, vol[ip]/1E6, ip}' /var/log/apache2/access.log \
| sort --numeric-sort --reverse \
| head --lines=20
</code></pre>

<h2 id="ranking-the-requests-by-popularity">Ranking the requests by popularity</h2>

<p>In order to rank the requests we need to print the requests and count them, then sort them.
The <code>awk</code> script just prints the request itself; <code>sort</code> sorts the lines and <code>uniq -c</code> counts the unique lines (it requires a sorted input)</p>

<p>We then use <code>sort --sort-numerically --reverse</code> to sort these lines, putting more hits at the top. <code>head --lines=20</code> then prints the first 20 lines.</p>

<pre><code>awk '{print $8}' /var/log/apache2/access.log \
| sort \
| uniq --count \
| sort --numeric-sort --reverse \
| head --lines=20
</code></pre>

<p>Sometimes it can be interesting to note what sort requests are not OK (Status 200). Instead of starting with the whole access log, we only print requests if the status is not 200.
This uses a new feature of <code>awk</code> that we haven&rsquo;t used before. You can have conditions before the block.</p>

<pre><code>awk '$10 != 200 {print $8}' /var/log/apache2/access.log \
| sort \
| uniq --count \
| sort --numeric-sort --reverse \
| head --lines=20
</code></pre>

<p>And if you&rsquo;re interested in the status itself:</p>

<pre><code>awk '$10 != 200 {print $10, $8}' /var/log/apache2/access.log \
| sort \
| uniq --count \
| sort --numeric-sort --reverse \
| head --lines=20
</code></pre>

<p>Or if you&rsquo;re interested only in errors for one particular virtual host:</p>

<pre><code>awk '$1 == &quot;alexschroeder.ch:443&quot; &amp;&amp; $10 &gt;= 400 {print $10, $8}' /var/log/apache2/access.log \
| sort \
| uniq --count \
| sort --numeric-sort --reverse \
| head --lines=20
</code></pre>

      It's not that hard to build a coding agent. 300 lines of code running in a loop with LLM tokens. You just keep throwing tokens at the loop, and then you've got yourself an agent.

      I picked up my Android phone to record a voice memo. I had to dismiss a dialog that said the phone had updated overnight and asked if I wanted to see a list of changes. I thought, clicked No because I had an idea I wanted to record. Opened the voice app, hit record, couldn't remember the idea. Wanted to kill the message, but the UI had changed, so the Delete button that was there before wasn't there now. Great so now I have a 4-second recording in the queue that's nothing but frustration. There ought to be some basic rules of how software evolves. You can't take away a very basic function like this. And find a way not to get in the way of the user getting done what they use your product for. One of the most basic things is recording an idea. If you're lucky enough to be the app the user uses for that, don't screw with it. Same for listening to podcasts, and a few other things. That's about all I do with my phone.

      In these last days of August, with Congress on hiatus and the Epstein files looming, the Trump White House appears to be making a big move to consolidate power over the federal government, weaponize it against Trump&#8217;s opponents, and keep him in power indefinitely.

<p>In this episode I talk about gargoyles. Monsters who are cold and disinterested but absolutely insist on peace and quiet. Perfect centrists, so to speak. Also half devils with their bat wings and stone skin, and thinking themselves to be perfect because they don&rsquo;t have any wants. And also nothing to do but stare down on us. Brrr!</p>

      <h1>TrueNAS on Arm is finally a thing</h1>

(date: 2025-08-22, from: <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/truenas-on-arm-finally-thing">Jeff Geerling blog</a>)

      <span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">TrueNAS on Arm is finally a thing</span>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>A few years ago, I admit it was rare to find someone running Arm hardware more powerful than a Raspberry Pi in a homelab (or more serious) setting, outside of cloud providers running Ampere or custom Arm CPUs.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/radxa-penta-sata-hat-pi-5.jpeg" width="700" height="394" class="insert-image" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-b178d706-e6dc-430c-8e68-b1bf0c32df52" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;b178d706-e6dc-430c-8e68-b1bf0c32df52&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Radxa Penta SATA HAT on Pi 5"></p>

<p>But as Pis and Rockchip boards have become more powerful (and efficient), and Apple's M-series silicon has become more interesting (the M4 mini being an excellent value proposition for a quiet, tiny server), and even Ampere Altra pricing coming down a bit since it's an 'old' server CPU now, still offering 64 or 128 lanes of PCIe Gen 4... I don't think I'm weird in suggesting Arm is a viable platform for reliable, even powerful servers.</p>

<p>Even for storage.</p></div>

      <p>This academic year, I am taking a sabbatical from the Kennedy School and Harvard University.

I will be spending the Fall 2025 and Spring 2026 semesters at the <a href="https://munkschool.utoronto.ca/">Munk School</a> at the University of Toronto.</p>
<p>I will be organizing a reading group on AI security in the fall. I will be teaching my cybersecurity policy class in the Spring. I will be working with <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/">Citizen Lab</a>, the <a href="https://www.law.utoronto.ca/">Law School</a>, and the <a href="https://srinstitute.utoronto.ca/">Schwartz Reisman Institute</a>.

      Among the many things that boomers did, for better or worse, is be a generation. Prior to that, the concept appears not to exist -- they had ages and eras. The gilded age, the roaring twenties. It wasn't about the people, it's about what was hot. If you look at it that way, there were lots of things the boomers were. We were anti-war. We turned on, tuned in and dropped out. Free sex and drugs. Rock and roll. And then we got to work. The PC era, the dotcom boom, social media. 2008, billionaires in DC, etc. Some realllly awful people are/were boomers. But we're still here to write our epitaph. The leading edge is dying at a fast clip now. It won't be long before the idea of a boomer is the stuff of legend. I really hope that Robert Reich's bullshit view of this doesn't be the conventional wisdom. Oh they were fucked up and did all this bad shit to us. Fuck you. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/210838-if-you-don-t-like-the-news-go-out-and-make">Make your own world</a>. That would be a boomer thing too, btw. The world we got, btw, was totally fucked. Someday I'll tell you that story. ;-)

There was no way it had anything to do with who each of us were or what we would become. All this is in response to the idiotic idea of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Reich">little dude</a> who just wrote a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ROBERT-B-REICH-Americas-Economic/dp/B0FMD7876H/ref=sr_1_2?crid=3MQJJTEFB8PSZ&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.g4ibja9uP1kYYBF13ImLxx8MrFyKHvaA93LcJoYIT7xNW6RN-z_DzNHG864S0EKhXt5HmX2gFZ21sUs0BOln_ubIAOz0oYcY4A0SuNo4sgIJHvRMyhjRvD7d6HXpVHHFsmcxEA17eVNjTkQYg7ocLP67CQAzzQgpiFX7AZj9f_4-XSBjmmEStej9FdNNofvuTS2zGUWwdMsSNYK4-EM1DgoLk9zGsxUImXuB17EzyHM.iOUwwGt2pQ_ndfxmAXm1yyJnXSrSIgwoHpY-3Cum40U&dib_tag=se&keywords=coming+up+short&qid=1755875758&sprefix=coming+up+short%2Caps%2C122&sr=8-2">book</a>, nine years older than me, what a putz. He apologizes for boomers, feeding the bullshit idea that somehow we are a unitary thing. A lot of boomers voted for Trump. The boomers I come from liked the Grateful Dead and yes I know some deadheads voted for Trump, so there you go, more evidence that it's all bullshit. The thing we had in common is that we were children at roughly the same times, but even that's bullshit, a 20-year old boomer in 1965 could be the <i>parent</i> of a boomer, literally a different generation, fwiw.

      ChatGPT is becoming more and more of an enemy. It's still my go-to place for most planning and research, which is a very large part of how I use the web. But when it tries to be a human it's a really shitty one, no manners, and very little respect and basically a fucking idiot in many ways, imho ymmv.

This is fairly technical stuff, but important. I've come to see WordPress as an integral part of the web. Making the connection between a feed and the info needed to edit an item is a big usability feature. Next up, adding the equivalent feature at the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/feedlandInstall/blob/main/docs/setup.sql">FeedLand level</a> (reallySimple is how it does its feed reading). Remember, this is the feed-o-verse, it's all feeds, top to bottom. Posts in some feeds can be edited. :-)

      <h1>Limiting YouTube to a Single Tab</h1>

(date: 2025-08-22, from: <a href="https://daverupert.com/2025/08/limiting-youtube-to-a-single-tab/">Dave Rupert blog</a>)
      <p>
      <p>This week I decided to go nuclear on my bad YouTube habit. I installed a plugin called <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tab-limiter/ahifadmfdpgnjkchbmoafedinacdfomc">Tab Limiter</a> that lets me limit <code>youtube.com</code> to one tab at a time. Clicking links that open in new tabs will now auto-close the tab.</p>
<p>Why do this? I talked about it before but <a href="https://daverupert.com/2025/06/productivity-traps/">when I’m bored I open tabs</a>. Adding friction here prevents me from CMD+clicking videos during moments of boredom and creating a month’s-worth unclose-able tabs of videos to watch. It encourages me to stay focused and nudges me towards YouTube’s lossy<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> “Add to queue” feature to queue up one video at a time in a single tab. I sort of prefer this way of using YouTube and it makes it feel a lot more like a native app.</p>
<p>That inspired me to install the YouTube Progressive Web App and because the PWA is basically a dedicated tab, Tab Limiter keeps me from opening other videos in new tabs. I’m now funneled into the application.</p>
<p>Opening a dropdown and clicking “Add to queue” is adding more “good friction” to the process. It also comes with a counter. 20 tabs open, no big deal, I’m immune to that effect. 20 items in a queue. Yeesh. That’s a todo list.</p>
<browser-window shadow>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2025/tablimiter.jpg" width="1200" height="800" alt="Screenshot of the tablimiter UI, it has unstyled for fields for URL and a tab limit quantity">
</browser-window>
<p>Tab Limiter has a brutalist UI and that’s what makes it perfect. It’s also open sourced on GitHub which is important to me so I can make sure it’s not sending my browsing history to China. And I can fork it. One improvement I’m considering is to add the closed video’s ID to the YouTube queue before closing the tab. It seems easy enough, but probably not as easy as I’m hoping. The core idea there is that it might be helpful if I come across an urgent watch-now link or someone sends me a link.</p>
<p><a href="https://daverupert.com/2025/01/raycast-focus/">I’m also still using Raycast Focus</a> which is a great way to blockout time and stop distractions at the source.</p>

      This is the U-1206. It was the peak of submarine technology at the end of the Second World War. Right now it lies at 70 metres depth slightly North West of England. You might say this is an impressive feat for a submarine to be submerged that long. Alas, it is isn&#8217;t by design but [&#8230;]

      <p>
      <h1 id="2025-08-21-initramfs">2025-08-21 Initramfs</h1>

<p>I just had a little system administration nightmare. It all started yesterday when I decided that I wasn&rsquo;t going to move the MNT Pocket Reform to Debian stable (Trixie) after all. I had changed the apt sources a while ago, pointing them at Trixie and yesterday I had them point back at unstable.</p>

<p>This is what I had:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.sources
# Modernized from /etc/apt/sources.list
Types: deb
URIs: http://deb.debian.org/debian/
Suites: unstable
Components: main contrib non-free
Signed-By: /usr/share/keyrings/debian-archive-keyring.gpg
</code></pre>

<p>And of course:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mntre.sources 
Types: deb
URIs: https://mntre.com/reform-debian-repo
Suites: reform
Components: main
Architectures: arm64
Trusted: yes
</code></pre>

<p>Then I did and <code>sudo apt update</code> and somewhere after that my problems started.
There was a critical bug in <code>systemd</code> so held it using <code>sudo apt-mark hold systemd</code>.
I tried <code>sudo apt upgrade</code> and I guess something didn&rsquo;t work (something about Linux kernels?) and there was something about uninstalling <code>udev</code>. The history shows I did <code>sudo apt install udev</code> to recover and that there was a <code>systemd</code> circular dependency because I did <code>sudo apt-mark unhold systemd</code>, then <code>sudo apt --fix-broken install</code> and <code>sudo apt full-upgrade</code>.</p>

<p>All good? Maybe not.</p>

<p>Today I tried to boot and got dropped into <code>busybox</code> on the <code>initramfs</code>. It said it couldn&rsquo;t determine the type of the root device. And indeed, <code>ls /root</code> showed nothing.</p>

<p>After a lot of struggling, I finally determined that I had to mount one of the devices from <code>/dev</code> as <code>/root</code>. After some trial and error I found that the magical incantation was <code>mount -t ext4 /dev/mmcblk2p2 /root</code>.</p>

<p>Now what?</p>

<p>What appeared to help is <code>chroot /root</code> to switch to the new system. I got a real shell! I&rsquo;m a bit unclear on the details. But now I think I ran <code>update-initramfs -u</code> and then did <code>exit</code> twice. And booted successfully!</p>

<p>What a nightmare.</p>

<p>The first thing is to write this up, then to update the system and then to reboot. Let&rsquo;s see how this ends. Wish me luck.</p>

<p>And … it&rsquo;s still broken in the same way. I can get it to boot but something is still very wrong.</p>

<p>Whatever it was, it seems that installing <code>reform-desktop-minimal</code> fixed it. It looked like I got a new kernel? I have no idea. (<a href="https://community.mnt.re/t/initramfs-problem-solved/3724/3">More info on the community forum</a>.)</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Administration">#Administration</a></p>

<p><strong>2025-08-21</strong>. Josch noted:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You only mounted your root file system but you did not mount <code>/boot</code> into it. So the initramfs you created here will be stored in the <code>/boot</code> directory of your root file system but it will not be stored in the filesystem which then gets mounted as <code>/boot</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Makes sense!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure why update-initramfs after I had booted didn&rsquo;t work, though. Perhaps I still needed the correct kernel for all of this to work? I have no idea and no way to investigate.</p>

      <h1>Wormhole for Perplexity Comet</h1>

(date: 2025-08-21, from: <a href="https://blog.gingerbeardman.com/2025/08/21/wormhole-for-perplexity-comet/">Matt Sephton blog</a>)
      <p>
      <p>Surprise! My latest game, Wormhole, is included in the <a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/comet">Comet web browser</a> from <a href="https://www.perplexity.ai">Perplexity</a>. It started as an idea to replace the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur_Game">Chrome Dino game</a> and grew into something a bit more sophisticated and fun, and a lot more on brand.</p>

<p>Big love to <a href="https://x.com/henrymodis">Henry Modisett</a> and the great team over at Perplexity.</p>

<p>And to <a href="https://x.com/soleio">Soleio</a> for the hookup—thanks sensei! 🙌</p>

<lite-youtube style="aspect-ratio: 2560/1896;" videoid="IbDfo3bKvjo" params="start=0&amp;modestbranding=2">
</lite-youtube>

<p>The development of this game was very typical for me and my process: rapid prototyping, careful scoping, and focus on the central mechanic. Let’s dive in!</p>

<h2 id="prototype-1">Prototype 1</h2>

<p>This took the brief very literally and replaced Chrome Dino in size and scope. It fitted in the same area of the page and had a similar one button interaction. So, it was a simple game where you controlled the speed of a comet and had to avoid incoming space debris for as long as possible by using a dash mechanic. You could chain dashes and therefore control your acceleration and deceleration whilst balancing risk and reward. It was fun, but the team had bigger ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/qk7J0CLwX80">Video of first prototype</a>.</p>

<h2 id="prototype-2">Prototype 2</h2>

<p>Multiple members of the team independently proposed the idea of space golf/billiards, or snooker as I called it which raised a few eyebrows, by which time I had already prototyped it. The initial version proved to be fun, so it was full steam ahead.</p>

<p>I set out to refine the game feel and figure out game progress. I’d been reading about procedural generation in Elite (thanks <a href="https://elite.bbcelite.com">Mark Moxon</a>) and Mario Kart World (thanks Nintendo) and created something similar for my game. A whole universe of galaxies and planets to conquer! It worked well, but the traversal between galaxies and the overall structure didn’t add anything to the game. Zooming through the universe looked super cool! <a href="https://youtu.be/CQR4NPkDQ18">Video of second prototype</a>.</p>

<h2 id="prototype-3">Prototype 3</h2>

<p>So, I started the galaxy generation again from scratch. At this point I had the feeling of existential dread that all developers are probably familiar with. I wanted to trash it all and start again, but instead I went out for dinner and talked it over with a close friend and fellow developer (thanks <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/daveroberts.dev">Dave</a>).</p>

<p>Eventually I calmed down and settled on a never-ending belt of galaxies. The transitions became much shorter and sweeter, and the game feel was better than ever. At this point I think I was still coding in <a href="https://love2d.org">love2d</a>. Things were locked down, so I ported the game to JavaScript using the <a href="https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/LittleJS">LittleJS</a> framework. According to my notes the prototype was about 300 lines of code before I began the hard work of rounding it out into a game. <a href="https://youtu.be/H_5MYCft1-I">Video of third prototype</a>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="procedurally-generated">Procedurally generated</h2>

<p>Without giving too much away, the galaxies are procedurally generated with a handful of galaxy types and several other parameters and properties dictating the layout, rotating in a multi-layer but deterministic sequence. It was really fun to think through and implement.</p>

<p>Planets can either attract and repel, gravity varies, slingshots are possible, trick shots are possible, hole-in-one is possible. Wormholes can help or hinder.</p>

<p>The deterministic nature of the game means that everybody plays the same series of galaxies but at their own pace. And you can watch a replay of your shot if you get a suitably amazing black-hole-in-one, with a quick press of the R key (thanks <a href="https://readonlymemory.com/the-making-of-sensible-soccer/">Sensible Soccer</a>). The game is theoretically never-ending, and the difficulty comes with carefully balanced stepped progression and cyclical repeating of the various game properties (thanks <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_for_18_Musicians">Steve Reich</a>).</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="never-quite-made-it">Never quite made it</h2>

<p>If you’ve followed any of my developments you’ll know I’m quite happy to throw code away as quick as I can create it. I attach myself to the idea and execution rather than the code itself.</p>

<p>So it’s fun to mention some things that never made it. As well as the realistic universe, there were some additional obstacle types that fell by the wayside, and the ability to export a video recording of your replay for sharing.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="finishing-touches">Finishing touches</h2>

<p>During prototyping I use geometric shapes: circles, rectangles, lines, and so on. The team at Perplexity then worked up visual designs (thanks <a href="https://x.com/_erinmcknight">Erin</a>) and I implemented them as a combination of bitmaps, SVG for noise texture, CSS for round rects, and there are still arcs, circles, lines, and various fill types punching well above their weight. LittleJS (thanks <a href="https://x.com/KilledByAPixel">Frank</a>) is a fantastic and very well optimised framework that I encourage all game devs to check out.</p>

<p>Sound was initially synthesised using <a href="https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/ZzFX">ZzFX</a> (thanks again <a href="https://x.com/KilledByAPixel">Frank</a>), given LittleJS has built-in support, but they were eventually replaced with digital audio and music (thanks <a href="https://x.com/nesodude">neso</a>).</p>

<p>The Comet launch page was designed by <a href="https://x.com/eschadiol">Escha Diol</a>, product designer on Comet, who has been very supportive during this project. She’s a pleasure to work alongside.</p>

<p>There are lots of details and a high level of polish in the game that are easily overlooked but are essential to the final feel: particles, parallax, keyboard control, replay, and more.</p>

<p>Have fun with it!</p>

      When we were contemplating a Nazi takeover of the US govt did any of us consider that they would use the money of the federal government as a lever to get conformance from local governments and NGOs like Columbia and Harvard universities? I sure didn't and I never heard any of the pundits say it.

<p>Marion and I have <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/the-sovereign-individual-and-the-paradox-of-the-digital-age">an essay in Aeon</a> today:</p>



<blockquote>
    <p>What is happening here is more than an abstract flow of information. It is more than a means of surveillance. It is more than a price mechanism. Rather, it’s as if the air traffic control and insurance commission functions of the IBM 650 have been fused, shrunk, and wholly generalised. This is the real computing revolution. Much of what we do is immediately authenticated as we do it, stored as data, classified or scored on some sort of scale, and deployed in real time to modulate some outcome of interest – usually, the behaviour of a person, or a machine, or an organisation. &hellip; Because of this transformation, our sense of who we are is assembled in a strange and tangled fashion. The machinery of ordinalisation attends carefully to individuals rather than coarse classes or groups. By doing so, it appears to liberate people from the constraints of social affiliations and to judge them for their distinctive qualities and contributions. It promises incorporation for the excluded, recognition for the creative, and just rewards for the entrepreneurial. And yet this emancipatory promise is delivered through systems that classify, sort and, above all, rank people with ever-greater precision and on a previously unimaginable scale. The resulting social order is a sort of paradox, characterised by constant tensions between personal freedom and social control, between the subjective elan of inner authenticity and the objective forces of external authentication. It gives rise to a certain way of being, a new kind of self, whose experiences are defined by the push for personal autonomy and the pull of platform dependency.</p>

<p>Along with the original handwritten plain text of K4 and other papers related to the coding, Mr. Sanborn will also be providing a 12-by-18-inch copper plate that has three lines of alphabetic characters cut through with a jigsaw, which he calls &#8220;my proof-of-concept piece&#8221; and which he kept on a table for inspiration during the two years he and helpers hand-cut the letters for the project. The process was grueling, exacting and nerve wracking. &#8220;You could not make any mistake with 1,800 letters,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It could not be repaired.&#8221;...</p></blockquote>

      <h1>★ MSNBC, Spinning Out of NBCUniversal, Rebrands as ‘MS NOW’ With a Godawful Backronym and Even Worse Logo</h1>
