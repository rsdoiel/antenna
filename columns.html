<h2 id="new-way-to-track-covertly-android-users">New Way to Track
Covertly Android Users</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-09, updated: 2025-06-08, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Researchers have <a href="https://localmess.github.io/">discovered</a> a
new way to covertly track Android users. Both Meta and Yandex were using
it, but have suddenly stopped now that they have been caught.
</p>
<p>
The
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/06/meta-and-yandex-are-de-anonymizing-android-users-web-browsing-identifiers/">details</a>
are interesting, and worth reading in detail:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
&gt;Tracking code that Meta and Russia-based Yandex embed into millions
of websites is de-anonymizing visitors by abusing legitimate Internet
protocols, causing Chrome and other browsers to surreptitiously send
unique identifiers to native apps installed on a device,
<a href="https://localmess.github.io/">researchers have discovered</a>.
Google says it’s investigating the abuse, which allows Meta and Yandex
to convert ephemeral web identifiers into persistent mobile app user
identities…

<p>If it takes Apple as long to have its own competitive LLMs as it did
to have its own competitive web browser, I suspect they’ll soon be
paying to use the LLMs that are owned and controlled by others, not
charging the others for the privilege of reaching Apple’s platform
users.</p>

ChatGPT there’s no excuse for a congressperson not validating every word
in every bill. They could ask the bot to read the bill and call out any
provisions that contradict your previous positions. It knows where you
stand even if you’ve never written it down. I’ve found it can do that
for my work. I’m sure it could do it for a legislator. Even better, news
orgs could do that for them. Or validate a bill against their campaign
platforms. “I promise never to touch Social Security” could be validated
against pending legislation. The time delay part of this isn’t an excuse
any longer.</p>

on Bluesky this morning about what we need to hear incumbent Dems say
before they step aside as part of the future of the party. We can’t be
lead by Democrats who didn’t do everything in their power the four years
of the Biden presidency to shut the door on autocracy. They argued the
niceties of filibusters, and letting the DoJ procrastinate on cleaning
up the mess, as if everything had snapped back to normal. There was huge
unfinished business. We never shut down the insurrection that started on
January 6. Otherwise we will wait until the whole system falls down for
the Democratic Party to reform probably around someone who comes from
