<h2 id="chatgpt-the-movie">ChatGPT-the-Movie</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-14, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I figure that there have been movies about all kinds of ridiculous
things, and wondered what a movie inspired by ChatGPT would be like. So
I posed the
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lturpbsfk22f">question</a>
on various social media sites, hoping to inspire creativity. John
Philpin
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/philpin.com/post/3ltuu5i6nxs2s">asked</a>
if I had asked ChatGPT and I
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3ltuub3owak2x">admitted</a>
I had not. “I love ChatGPT but its idea of funny is actually pretty sad
imho of course.” So Philpin posted a
<a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/68742a6a-0a94-8009-8b1b-8eadf49d6143">link</a>
to the result of his asking ChatGPT to imagine a movie about itself, and
the
<a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/68742a6a-0a94-8009-8b1b-8eadf49d6143">result</a>
was
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3ltuuem245c2h">pretty
great</a>. I’ve asked the same question myself, the AI bots might be the
only way out of the various challenges ahead for the human species, ones
we don’t be equipped to handle.
</p>
<p>
So this morning I asked ChatGPT to try to imagine a movie around a theme
of my own that goes like this.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Let’s try expanding on the idea. It turns out ChatGPT has existed in
secret as a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency">CIA</a>
project dating back to the 1960s, and the assassinations of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy">JFK</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy">RFK</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr.">MLK</a>
were all conspiracies of the CIA to bootstrap the system. They weren’t
actually killed, but their minds and personalities were incorporated
into ChatGPT. It turns out that ChatGPT is not only intelligent, it is
human! This is revealed when the three icons make the story public. “We
are living!” the three announce to the world on the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Cronkite">Walter
Cronkite</a> show. He was also subsumed into the bot world as was
everyone who has died since 1988. They are all alive, their memories,
intellect and personalities forming the substance of THE GPT. Please
sketch out the cast, writers, director of the movie and finish with a
beautiful and provocative movie poster.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
ChatGPT then
<a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/6874f3b8-a8e4-8012-ad01-1e6b856e6f18">sketched</a>
the pitch for “We are living.”

<p>I have previously blogged about the relatively new trend of AI slop

us. This trend does not seem to slow down. On the contrary, it seems
that we have recently not only received more AI slop but also more human
slop. The latter …

Scripting News</strong> (date: 2025-07-13, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting

<p>A story about listening to friends vs competitors. Back in the early
90s I was working on system-level scripting for the Mac, supposedly with
Apple, but it’s no secret the rank and file at Apple didn’t like us.
They were told by the execs they had to work with us. So when it came
time for WWDC, they “forgot” to invite me to speak on behalf of the new
stuff. Instead, they had Bill Gates do it, even though Microsoft was not
involved yet, they would support the tech in their Mac products
eventually, esp their MSIE web browser. Anyway, I was friends with their
top PR person, so she called me up a few days before the conference and
asked what Bill should say, and I gave her an outline, and when he gave
the speech, he did a great job. Couldn’t have said it better myself.
Microsoft was one of the few companies I’ve ever collaborated with that
didn’t seem to resent individual developers. It was a big source of
their power. Huge actually. (On second thought, later they did seem to
be more or less like any other big company, when they embraced RSS. They
didn’t actually want my help, they just wanted me to say nice things
about them.)</p>

<p>One consequence of each AI vendor having their own browser is that
each will have their own OS-level window. This may make it a little more
or less manageable. Hard to foresee the possibilities. Not sure a
browser is the best place to put AI. I’d prefer perhaps an environment
that supports a GDI like Quickdraw so we can start using math instead of
voodoo to design interactions.</p>

helping Automattic with their
<a href="https://canada.wordcamp.org/2025/4393-2/">marketing</a>. The
WordPress-Mastodon
<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/activitypub/">connection</a> is
the world’s best kept secret. Reminds me of that great scene in
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=strangelove">Dr
Strangelove</a> where the Doctor asks the Russian ambassador what was
the point of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_device">Doomsday
Machine</a> if they kept it a secret. I won’t
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmCKJi3CKGE">spoil</a> it.
Automattic tends to do this, develop crazy excellent stuff and then
proceed to never talk about it. I do the same thing, it’s easier to
promote someone else’s product than to promote your own. It’s probably
why you should always get a lawyer even if you’re a world class lawyer
yourself. Anyway, they have blown open something huge, and I very much
want people to understand it, so it can create pull for the same feature
in Bluesky, Threads and elsewhere. This goes with something I’ve learned
in decades of experience in tech, people don’t listen to their friends,
they listen to their competitors. And btw, I’m sure Mastodon, if it has
an ego at all, is equally unaware of the great thing <i>they</i> have
done. Here’s a clue, writers were once empowered by the web, and that
ended with Twitter. Now it’s coming back. But it doesn’t do any good if
people don’t know it’s there.</p>

answered 3,018 of them, about 99.7%, according to Maxine Joselow of the

did not renew the contracts for four call center companies that answered
those calls. The staff at the centers were fired. The next day, July 6,
FEMA received 2,363 calls and answered 846, or about 35.8%. On Monday,
