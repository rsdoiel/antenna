Automatic Toll Booths by Obscuring License Plates</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-20, updated: 2024-03-14, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
The <i>Wall Street Journal</i> is
<a href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/sneaky-drivers-dodging-toll-cameras-cost-authorities-millions-5941fe31?st=y6zwgzfhmswlb0b&#038;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink">reporting</a>
on a variety of techniques drivers are using to obscure their license
plates so that automatic readers can’t identify them and charge tolls
properly.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Some drivers have power-washed paint off their plates or covered them
with a range of household items such as leaf-shaped magnets,
Bramwell-Stewart said. The Port Authority says officers in 2023 roughly
doubled the number of summonses issued for obstructed, missing or
fictitious license plates compared with the prior year.
</p>
<p>
Bramwell-Stewart said one driver from New Jersey repeatedly used what’s
known in the streets as a flipper, which lets you remotely swap out a
car’s real plate for a bogus one ahead of a toll area. In this instance,
the bogus plate corresponded to an actual one registered to a woman who
was mystified to receive the tolls. “Why do you keep billing me?”
Bramwell-Stewart recalled her asking…

<p>date: 2024-03-19, from: David Rosenthal’s blog</p>
Thankfully, pig butchering scams are getting attention. Three weeks
after I posted
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/02/tracing-pig-butchers.html"><i>Tracing
The Pig Butchers</i></a>, John M. Griffin and Kevin Mei posted
<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4742235"><i>How
Do Crypto Flows Finance Slavery? The Economics of Pig
Butchering</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Through blockchain addresses used by ‘‘pig butchering’’ victims, we
trace crypto flows and uncover methods commonly used by scammers to
obfuscate their activities, including multiple transactions, swapping
between cryptocurrencies through DeFi smart contracts, and bridging
across blockchains. The perpetrators interact freely with major crypto
exchanges, sending over 104,000 small potential inducement payments to
build trust with victims. Funds exit the crypto network in large
quantities, mostly in Tether, through less transparent but large
exchanges—Binance, Huobi, and OKX. These criminal enterprises pay
approximately 87 basis points in transaction fees and appear to have
recently moved at least $75.3 billion into suspicious exchange deposit
accounts, including $15.2 billion from exchanges commonly used by U.S.
investors. Our findings highlight how the ‘‘reputable’’ crypto industry
provides the common gateways and exit points for massive amounts of
criminal capital flows. We hope these findings will help shed light on
and ultimately stop these heinous crimes.

Their Figure 9 shows the flow of funds over time into the
<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4742235">scammer’s
wallets at exchanges</a>. This is how they estimated the $75.3B; their
extremely conservative estimate is $35.1B, and their liberal estimate is
$237.6B. Note the huge ~$45B increase from January 2021 to January 2023,
partly driven by the cryptocurrency boom, and the slowing until January
2024. Presumably the ETF pump will accelerate the rate.<br /> <br />
Below the fold, some commentary on this and other recent
developments.<br /> <span><a name='more'></a></span> <br /> Note that
these numbers are <i>flows</i> not the total revenue for the scammers,
there is some double-counting involved as scammers move funds between
their accounts at these exchanges. The $15.2B is likely much closer to
revenue, because the scammers generally don’t want to move significant
sums <i>into</i> Western exchanges.<br /> <br /> Griffin and Wei start
their tracing from a collection of the wallet addresses which the
scammers used to
<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4742235">receive
funds from victims</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
We start with 3,256 Ethereum addresses, 770 Bitcoin addresses, and 702
Tron addresses. Most addresses are used ten or more times, and 28% of
addresses are used more than one hundred times. Of these initial sets,
Ethereum addresses receive $5.8 billion in funds, compared to $389
million for Tron and $373 million for Bitcoin. Given that the Ethereum
addresses represent approximately 88% of the total funds, we begin by
examining Ether (ETH, the native cryptocurrency on Ethereum) and token
(commonly known as ERC-20 tokens) transactions on the Ethereum
blockchain.
</blockquote>
<br /> They then follow the way the scammers try to
<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4742235">obscure
their activites</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
We trace victim funds in bulk and follow their paths to centralized
exchange deposit addresses from January 2020 to February 2024. Figure 1
plots the resulting network for a three percent sample of nodes from the
traced network and highlights many features.
</blockquote>
This reveals four main points:<br />
<ul>
<li>
The
<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4742235">sources
of the funds</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
First, the figure shows how crypto often originates from large exchanges
where investors commonly have accounts (Coinbase, Crypto.com, and
Binance) and flows into the network.
</blockquote>
The victims need to convert fiat into cryptocurrency using well-known,
trusted exchanges.
</li>
<li>
Where the scammers
<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4742235">move
the funds next</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Second, funds are often swapped for Tether (known as USDT) through
Tokenlon.
</blockquote>
Tokenlon is not a mixer, similar to
<a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/tornado-hit-by-the-department-of-justice">Tornado
Cash</a>, but “a relatively obscure decentralized exchange”. The
scammers’ goal is partly to obscure their tracks but also to avoid the
volatility of cryptocurrencies by converting to stablecoins at the first
opportunity.
</li>
<li>
The scammers need to
<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4742235">find
an off-ramp to fiat</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Third, after circulating through various hops in the network, crypto
exits the system through centralized exchange deposit addresses.
</blockquote>
Even stablecoins won’t by the Lambo, so the scammers have to get their
loot to somewhere that can convert it to fiat.
</li>
<li>
Which exchanges are
<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4742235">useful
off-ramps</a>?<br />
<blockquote>
Fourth, transactions in amounts above $100,000 and in particular $1
million commonly transfer funds to deposit addresses on Binance, Huobi,
and OKX.
</blockquote>
Obviously, they are the offshore exchanges that lack effective KYC/AML,
and in particular the one that
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-21/binance-ceo-zhao-to-plead-guilty-in-us-settlement-wsj">pled
guilty</a>.
</li>
</ul>
Note that this research contrasts with the tracing efforts I discussed
in
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/02/tracing-pig-butchers.html"><i>Tracing
The Pig Butchers</i></a>, which traced flows starting from a few victim
reports. This research both starts from a much larger collection of
victim reported addresses, and uses network analysis techniques to
identify a much larger set of scammer wallet addresses. Thus it is
understandable that
<a href="https://www.citationneeded.news/issue-53/">Molly White is
skeptical</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
But the $75 billion number was certainly a surprise, and it’s hit
mainstream outlets including
<a href="https://time.com/6836703/pig-butchering-scam-victim-loss-money-study-crypto/"><i>Time</i></a>.
I have to say I have some doubts about the number, particularly given
other estimates have been in the low billions, but regardless, it’s
clear that the pig butchering issue in crypto is a multi-billion dollar
problem.
</blockquote>
But there are good reasons why Griffin and Wei would come up with much
larger numbers for <i>revenue</i> than earlier tracing efforts; they are
looking at a much larger fraction of the total scammer network. Zeke
Faux’s article in
<a href="https://time.com/6836703/pig-butchering-scam-victim-loss-money-study-crypto/"><i>Time</i></a>
starts:<br />
<blockquote>
Pig-butchering scammers have likely stolen more than $75 billion from
victims around the world, far more than previously estimated, according
to a new study.
</blockquote>
That is not what the paper says.
<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4742235">It
says they</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
recently moved at least $75.3 billion into suspicious exchange deposit
accounts
</blockquote>
The paper points out that the $75.3B in <i>flows</i> includes some
amount of
<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4742235">double-counting</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
If a network sent funds from say OKX to Binance, it would lead to the
double-counting of funds. Additionally, the funds may be due to other
activities of the criminal networks. … We examine the sources of funds
that later enter into these potential scammer deposit addresses and find
that $40.2 billion of the $75.3 billion can be attributed to exchanges.
</blockquote>
It is unlikely that all this movement from one exchange to another is
between scammer accounts, so $35.1B is a conservative estimate.<br />
<br /> The scammers do send small amounts to
<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4742235">exchange
deposit wallets</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Across all exchanges, the scammer network initiated 104,460 deposits to
centralized exchanges for amounts below $10,000, most commonly in small
amounts clustering at round numbers, such as $100, $200 or $500. The
transaction patterns mirror the characteristics of inducement payments
in pig butchering scams, which are small payments from scammers to
victims used to build trust. … We find 83% of potential inducement
payments are sent from addresses used in more than ten transactions,
suggesting limited monitoring by crypto exchanges.
</blockquote>
There is a reason for “limited monitoring by crypto exchanges”. The 87
basis points the authors find on movements of $75.3B is $655M in fees
over 4 years, enough to motivate turning a blind eye.<br /> <br />

Griffin and Wei’s Figure 2a shows their trace of a single victim report.
Their figures use the following
<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4742235">conventions</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Edges that are concave up represent flows moving from left to right
(e.g., the curve moves as if going from 9 o’clock to 3 o’clock).
Similarly, edges that are concave down represent flows moving from right
to left (e.g., from 3 o’clock to 9 o’clock). Nodes are colored by
identity, … and their size is proportional to the total amount
transacted. Edges are colored by transaction size and identity. Green
edges are transactions from exchanges, while blue and purple are
transactions to exchanges. Edges entering or exiting exchanges with
darker colors represent larger transactions.

What

step was to find other flows into the collection node, as shown in
Figure 2b. Even this one step into the network produces a large number
of scammer wallet addresses, the addresses to which other victims were
directed to send funds. By identifying these wallets the authors
generate a huge number of additional “victim reports”.<br /> <br />

Tracing the flows out of the collection nodes produces an enormous
number of other scammer wallets, shown in Figure 2c, as the funds are
shuffled around to obfuscate the flows.<br /> <br /> The off-ramps are
at exchanges, so the authors need to find the
<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4742235">scammers
deposit addresses</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Since scammers are unlikely to return large sums of stolen funds, we
consider deposit addresses that receive more than $100,000 as more
likely to be scammer deposit addresses. These addresses are rarely
associated with Western exchanges, but are common within Binance, Huobi,
and OKX, as well as exchanges such as Kucoin, Bitkub, and MXC. The
common feature of these exchanges is that they have loose KYC procedures
and are perceived to be outside of U.S. jurisdiction. To more fully
understand the scope of the network, we apply “deposit address
clustering” by tracking addresses that send funds into these deposit
addresses and finding other recipient deposit addresses associated with
the same user. To avoid capturing payments made by criminals for things
like inducement payments, we exclude all connections below $100,000 and
only consider direct connections.
</blockquote>
This is where the $75.3B number comes from; it is the total inflow into
deposit addresses at offshore exchanges believed to be controlled by
scammers. Note again the potential for double-counting if scammers move
funds between these exchanges. Deposit address clustering was published
by Friedhelm Victor in
<a href="https://fc20.ifca.ai/preproceedings/31.pdf"><i>Address
clustering heuristics for Ethereum</i></a> (Section 5.1):<br />
<blockquote>
To credit the assets to the correct account, exchanges typically create
so-called deposit addresses, which will then forward received funds to a
main address. As these deposit addresses are created per customer,
multiple addresses that send funds to the same deposit address are
highly likely to be controlled by the same entity. … The forwarded
amount is often slightly less than what was received, as the exchange
has to pay for the transaction costs. In most cases, deposit addresses
are EOAs [Externally Owned Accounts], but they can also be smart
contracts. When depositing tokens on the cryptocurrency exchange Kraken
for example, users are instructed to send them to a given smart contract
address, identical versions of which have been mass deployed in advance.
This makes it trivial to identify all identical token deposit contracts
deployed by Kraken. They are designed to forward received tokens
automatically, thereby passing on the transaction costs to the user.

Victor’s Figure 1 shows how this works. Wallets 0x2 and 0x3 deposit to
the same deposit address at exchange A, so they have the same account at
exchange A. Wallet 0x4 shares an account with 0x3 at exchange B, so all
three are the same entity.<br /> <br /> By analyzing the network graph
they discover using these techniques, Griffin and Wei draw the following
conclusions about
<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4742235">money
laundering</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Scammers extensively recirculate and swap funds across different
addresses and cryptocurrencies. These transactions incur costs, but may
help obfuscate the true source of their funds. We estimate that
transaction costs for a network of this scale total to 87 basis points
as a portion of outflows to exchange deposit addresses. In contrast,
Soudijn and Reuter (2016) find costs of 7-16% to move physical Euro
bills from Europe to Columbia and money laundering commission estimates
range from 4-12% (US Treasury Department, 2002) and 10-20% (US Treasury
Department, 2007). Cryptocurrencies thus appear to be a much more
cost-effective channel for moving illicit funds across borders. In
total, scammer swap transactions may constitute more than 58% of
Tokenlon transactions since 2022. We observe large inflows from
potentially Chinese victims in 2020; however, after the Chinese
financial authorities banned cryptocurrency trading in late 2021, there
appears to be a dramatic decrease in Chinese victims and a shift to
US-based victims. Overall, in the set of addresses touched by the
criminals, we find $1.172 trillion dollars of volume, 84% of which is in
Tether.
</blockquote>
Griffin and Wei
<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4742235">conclude</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
This project highlights how large-scale tracing of tainted funds can
help expose and understand criminal financial activity that can
hopefully be used as a roadmap in other criminal contexts. There are
several other practical implications of our study. First, organized or
“legitimate” crypto exchanges serve as the on- and off-ramps for
billions of dollars in criminal proceeds. Users with a crypto exchange
account should realize that crypto exchange users are frequent targets
of scams, and their funds are just a quick transfer away from being
irreversibly lost—a risk that is far less prevalent for traditional
investment accounts. Second, our findings indicate that the large
players in the crypto space are likely not sufficiently protecting their
customers from scams. Third, the Ethereum network appears to drastically
reduce barriers for illicit financial flows of transnational organized
crime. Fourth, romance scammers prefer the stablecoin Tether over other
cryptocurrencies and the Ethereum network over Bitcoin. Fifth,
decentralized exchanges also serve as large swapping points to exchange
crypto and obfuscate funds. Crypto hedge funds and users (many based in
the U.S. and Europe) who might purport to engage in “arbitrage” or
“liquidity trading” (PWC, 2023) may simply be making profits by
facilitating low-cost money laundering. Finally, the large centralized
crypto exchanges located in jurisdictions with opaque regulatory
environments (Binance, Huobi, OKX, and others) seem to be preferential
potential exit points that can further finance extremely large amounts
of criminal activities. Such activity has continued as of February 16,
2024, despite recent crackdowns.

<li>
Zeke Faux’s
<a href="https://time.com/6836703/pig-butchering-scam-victim-loss-money-study-crypto/">report
in <i>Time</i></a>, in which he writes:<br />
<blockquote>
Paolo Ardoino, the chief executive officer of Tether, called the report
false and misleading. “With Tether, every action is online, every action
is traceable, every asset can be seized and every criminal can be
caught,” Ardoino said in a statement. “We work with law enforcement to
do exactly that.”<br /> <br /> Tether has cooperated with authorities in
some cases to freeze accounts tied to fraud. But often by the time the
crime is reported, the scammers have already cashed out.
</blockquote>
This is more obfuscation from Tether. The paper clearly demonstrates
that the scammers rapidly convert their takings to stablecoins,
overwhelmingly Tether, and that they are able to use offshore exchanges
as their off-ramps.

<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2016/04/16/160609/remaking-social-media-for-the-next-revolution/">celebrated</a>
for sparking democratic uprisings in the Arab world and beyond. Now

Americans blamed social media for the coarsening of our political
discourse, the spread of misinformation, and the increase in partisan
polarization.

<p>
Today, tech’s darling is artificial intelligence. Like social media, it
has the potential to change the world in many ways, some favorable to
democracy. But at the same time, it has the potential to do incredible
damage to society…
